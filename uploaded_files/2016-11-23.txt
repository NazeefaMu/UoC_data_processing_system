A massage parlour next door to a girls? school
	
?
A massage parlour has been opened in Colombo 7 in close proximity to a well-known girls? school which had produced even a Prime Minister and a President of the country, they say.
?
Discreet inquiries made by highly ruffled parents have revealed that a political heavyweight whose two-syllable name -- a household word in the country these days -- is the real weight behind the person who opened the parlour.?
Girl students as well as their parents have already made representations to the Big Two in the regime about the unwelcome parlour close to the school.
However, the authorities have so far turned a deaf ear to their representations. Concerned parents wonder now whether they have to make their supplications to some powerful deity given the deafening silence on the part of those responsible in yahapalanaya.?

Ambitious niece suffers a setback again
	
?
JO?s big guns in the City of Gems recently participated in a powwow held to work out their roadmap to win all elections round the corner.
?
Talks were proceeding smoothly when a remark made by a prominent lady from the area made a sudden diversion. The veiled remark the lady made clearly conveyed the message that the JO needed a district leader to direct the party activity and she was the ideal person to fill the bill.?
However, the other JO Diyawanna members from the district immediately took exception to the idea.
They said in one voice that John the Silent who was making a consistent effort to unite the Blue party deserved the district leadership and this chair should be kept vacant for him. Finding there were no takers for her veiled suggestion, the lady deftly changed the subject.?

Case filed against Alan Mathiniyaramaya
	
A personal lawsuit has been filed against Ven. Uduwe Dhammaloka Thera in Colombo Chief Magistrate's Court today by four complainants on the allegation of high noise levels sustained by the residents living around the Alan Mathiniyaramaya Temple in Polhengoda where Dhammaloka is the Chief Incumbent.
Residents alleged that the exposure to such high level of noise constituted a health risk and there were sufficient scientific evidence to prove that danger due to the loudspeakers operated by the temple.
The complaints requested the Court to impose an appropriate order to prevent the temple being continuously amplifying such high levels of noise.
In the complaint, the residents said that they had on several times informed certain authorities and the Dhammaloka Thera too about the difficulty that they had to undergo. Yet, no actions were taken.
Complainants, Gavinda Jayasinghe, Dr. Kalinga Kaluperuma, Diren R. Halok, Milinda Moragoda and Kamalesh Johnpillei had filed the personal case citing Ven. Dhammaloka Thera as the defendant, in line with the Section 98 (136) of the Criminal Procedure Code, where people are permittd to file personal complaints in a Magistrate's Court without Police.

?
?
?
Ceylinco Insurance moved up the corporate ladder to the 15th position and once again earned the honour of being the only insurance company amongst the top 30 companies for the year 2015 / 2016.?
Sri Lanka?s top 30 companies were feted at a ceremony held at the Colombo Hilton recently. The occasion marked the fifth consecutive year that Ceylinco Insurance came out ahead in the insurance arena in the island, achieving a truly unique feat.
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe graced the awards ceremony as chief guest.?
Announcing the top 30 companies in Sri Lanka, the October 2016 issue of the Business Today magazine, outlined the rigorous process followed in selecting the ?top 30?and the criteria that needed to be fulfilled which includes ?the performance during the financial year ending December 31st, 2015 and March 31st, 2016.?
The financial information being reviewed for the selection process covered several aspects, which included: revenue, share turnover, profit after tax, growth in turnover, growth in profit, return on equity, growth in earnings per share, market capitalisation, value of shares transacted and value addition. ?
The ?assessment methods also include corporate governance amongst the considered criteria, and ?utilising such a method will no doubt influence better transparency and enhance accountability in public listed companies, enabling continued public trust and confidence in the corporate sector of the country. ?We congratulate the ??Business Today Top 30?, ?2015-2016 for their excellent performance and it is our sincere wish that they continue to perform while seeking new markets, thereby taking Sri Lanka to the world,? ?the October 2016 issue of ?Business Today?, commented in relation to the nation?s corporate echelon.
In another record-breaking year, in 2015, Ceylinco Insurance recorded a premium income of Rs.27 billion, while up to the third quarter of 2016, Ceylinco General Insurance and Ceylinco Life Insurance had together yielded an even more impressive total premium income of Rs. 23 billion. Along with this honour, and having been hailed as the undisputed market leader in the Sri Lankan Insurance sphere for the 12th consecutive year, Ceylinco Insurance also enjoys the euphoria of having been voted the People?s Insurance Company, for the tenth consecutive year, reiterating the high regard with which the company is viewed by the general public, and its continuous contributions towards enhancing the socio-economic development of Sri Lanka.

Govt moots body for media standards
	
Cabinet spokesman Minister Gayantha Karunatilaka today said that the government had decided to seek a public consultation to establish an independent mechanism for media standards.
Addressing the weekly cabinet news briefing, Minister Karunatilaka said this was to prevent misinformation, disinformation, character assassinations and publishing half baked news, lies and absolute lies have become the order of the day by both print and electronic media and the worse was the so-called social media that comprises web sites and FM services.
?Therefore, a monitoring and regulatory mechanism is extremely necessary to guide the media on the right direction while adhering to the law of the land, and honouring the journalistic guidelines and norms in journalism. Media considered as the fourth estate of a democracy must act with responsibility and decorum and it must not be a ?law unto themselves?, Minister Karunatilaka stressed.
A free, independent and diverse media with high ethical standards and professional competence, dedicated to provide a wide range of information and ideas to citizens, while serving as a public forum for well-informed democratic dialogue, is indispensable for the building and maintaining of democracy in Sri Lanka. The government is committed to creating an enabling environment for the media sector which is based on respect for internationally recognized professional standards and practices, and which ensures media accountability to those who rely on the media as a credible source of news and information.
The government has examined the comprehensive assessment of the overall environment for media development as set out in the report Rebuilding Public Trust: An Assessment of the Media Industry and Profession in Sri Lanka, which was presented to the Prime Minister on May 3, World Press Freedom Day, 2016 by the multi-stakeholder partnership for media reforms. The report contained a set of evidence-based recommendations developed through a multi-stakeholder consultative process and based on UNESCO?s widely accepted Media Development Indicators, he said.
The public debate will focus on recognising media freedom and the right of the media: (a) to gather and disseminate news and information; (b) to engage in critical reporting on matters of public interest; and (c) to participate in the process of forming public opinion. It will seek to make a penal offence for anyone wilfully to obstruct the legitimate collection of news and information by a journalist working for a media outlet.
To put in place systems, to promote the safety of journalists, to protect journalist?s right not to disclose their confidential sources of information, to make it a penal offence to subject anyone to any legal or employment related sanction or other forms of discrimination for providing information to journalists working for a media outlet concerning public affairs or on matters of public interest except where the secrecy of the information is justified by a larger public interest.
To make it illegal to impose sanctions on or to terminate the employment of an editor on a journalist because of his or her refusal to violate recognized professional codes of practice. To establish an independent Council with a mandate to develop and apply codes of practice for media outlets based on internationally recognized standards for the media.
The proposed Council will function as the oversight mechanism of a system of self-regulation and will have the power to apply sanction for wilful violations of its codes of practice. The approaches towards ensuring the independence of the Right to Information Commission will also be applicable to the Council, which will comprise eminent persons of whom two-thirds are nominated by organisations representing the media and journalists and one-third are nominated by civil society organisations.
To ensure the credibility of and public confidence in the Council, a Judge of a court of law nominated by the Judicial Services Commission in consultation with the Bar Association of Sri Lanka will serve as Chairperson. The senure of Council members will be protected and, in particular, removal will only be possible by vote of parliament following a recommendation of the Constitutional Council.
The government was ready to ensure legal protection for freedom of the press, including by protecting the media?s right to gather news and information, by repealing the Sri Lanka Press Council Act, No 5 of 1979, and by introducing an independent oversight mechanism to foster professional standards, with mandatory powers over media outlets, and the government invites the views interested Stakeholders in relation to its proposals to introduce legislation Minister Karunatilaka emphasized.

Govt. to start dialogue among religious and ethnic groups
	
The government is to initiate a dialogue among various ethnic and religious groups in the country to ease the tension between such groups.
Minister of Justice and Buddhasasana, Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe told journalists that all ethnic and religious groups were welcome to participate in the dialogue.
He said various groups, including the Bodu Bala Sena and Ravana Balaya, had agreed to participate in the effort to resolve issues through dialogue. ?The agreement was reached at a meeting I had with members of the Bodu Bala Sena and other groups in the Parliamentary Complex," he said.
However, he said, specific issues were not discussed, as the focus was on the creation of a platform to resolve the issues.
Referring to the statement he made in Parliament recently, that some Sri Lankan Muslims had joined ISIS, he said he was referring to Sri Lankans who had joined the group in the past and not to recent events.
He said the government wanted legislation against hate speech, which was already an offence under the penal code, upgraded to international standards. However, he said, it had to be stopped -- as those who wanted hate speech laws said upgrading the law was not necessary.
Bodu Bala Sena general secretary, the Ven. Galagodaatte Gnanasara Thera, said his organisation and the Sasanarakshaka Mandalaya as a whole would be engaged in a dialogue to try and resolve all issues in the future. "We trust the suggestion made by the minister," he said.
?Resolving issues through dialogue is the path shown by Buddha and we will take it," he said. (Yohan Perera)

JO lodges bribery complaint against Malik
	
The Joint Opposition lodged a complaint against International Trade Minister Malik Samarawickrama with the Bribery Commission today for allegedly misusing Mahapola funds amounting to Rs. 1 billion.
The complaint is the third in the series of Top Ten Yahapalana Mega Thieves initiative of the Joint Opposition.
Earlier, the JO lodged complaints against Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake on charges of financial misappropriation.
In today?s complaint, the JO alleged the Mahapola Higher Education Scholarship Trust Fund and Schools Development Fund had been invested in a private company called Asset Trust Management (Pvt.) Ltd.
Asset Trust Management is a subsidiary of SAFE Holding Company owned by Dr. Wickrema Weerasooria, the Chairman of the National Wealth Corporation (NWCL), which regulates the Mahapola Fund, JO member MP Sisira Jayakody said.
He said the appointment of Dr. Weerasooriya as NWCL Chairman was a violation of State fiscal policies.
?The funds of the Mahapola and Schools Development Fund had been invested in a second subsidiary company of SAFE Holding Company called Wealth Trust Securities Ltd. This subsidiary had recorded a profit of Rs. 1,000 million for a period of 21 months ended in October this year,? he said.? ?
The JO sought action against both Minister Samarawickrama and Dr. Weerasooria.
"Diabolical lies" says Dr. Weerasooria
Dr. Wickrema Weerasooria, the Chairman of the National Wealth Corporation Ltd (NWCL) vehemently rejected the allegations levelled against him by the Joint Opposition.
Speaking to Daily Mirror, Dr. Weerasooria said ?what? have been said by the JO was a diabolical lie.
?Mahapola funds have never been used by the said two companies and no Mahapola fund had been misused or abused. Gihan Jayatilleke, the Chief Executive Officer of NWCL could corroborate on this,? he said.
He said the allegations were attempts by the JO to embarrass Minister Malik Samarawickrama and himself. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

MR critical of leasing 15,000 acres to China in H?thota
	
Former president Mahinda Rajapaksa yesterday criticised the move to lease some 15,000 acres of land in Hambantota to China and said he was against giving out such a large extent of land.
He said what they envisaged was giving selected amounts of land for investment only.
Speaking to Newspaper Editors at his official residence in Colombo yesterday, the former president said the present government was now trying to appease China, after reprimanding it earlier. ?China was not treated properly when they came into power. We built the Airport, the harbour, the convention centre and others on a plan. That?s why they can now sell at a much higher price than the loans obtained for the airport and the port. They are accusing me of obtaining loans but now they are selling at a much higher price than the obtained loans and saying it is to settle the debts. They must not know arithmetic then,? he said.
When asked about President Maitripala Sirisena?s claim that the former President called a premature election knowing the debt crisis that the government was going to get into, the former president dismissed it saying that if he was in power there would not have been an economic crisis. ?There is no truth in those claims. He should know it because he sat in most of the government meetings including cabinet meetings. These are childish, immature talk. I don?t like to talk about those now,? he said.
On the eve of his departure to China, the former president said he was all for bringing in new foreign investment, but was against the policy of selling off the country?s resources.?I am not against investment; some of the investors who come even come and meet me. I tell all of them to come and invest. I don?t block them. But the problem many have is the instability of the government,? he said.
The former president said the main reason for the present economic problems was because the present government stopped all development work on January 8, 2015.
Speaking about the proposed constitutional reforms of the present government, the former president said the government was trying to take everyone for a ride by putting out various reports. ?They are trying to fool us. This has been decided by Sumanthiran, Jayampathi, the Diasapora and foreign powers. The question we ask is this. First talk of the main things which is whether it is unitary or federal,? he said.
When pointed out that the government had indicated that the new constitution was going to be of unitary nature, the former president said it should not be just confined to mere words. ?What has to be discussed is the framework. Whether the framework is going to be unitary or federal. Why are they allowing foreign powers to meddle in our affairs? ? he asked.
The former president said a new police unit is being created similar to the FCID to scare the politicians, civilian activists and monks who speak against federalism and the new constitution.
When asked about his views regarding the Muslim issue that happened during his government and the similar development taking place now, the former president said it contributed much in his losing the election. ? Those who did these things those days are doing the same now. They did it then to send me home. Now they are doing it to protect this government. To divert attention from the problems faced by the government. To bring the new constitution,? the former president said.

7 Must Do Things in Maldives!
	
If you've seen a picture of the earth as the blue-green sphere, and are disillusioned by the fact that what you see hardly looks anything like it - there's hope. There is a paradise-like country where the blues and greens are so incredibly beautiful, it's almost sinful to not visit.
The Maldives are, in all their three-sixty-degree glory, a sight for sore eyes. No matter where you turn to look, you'll see pristine white beaches and water that's looks less like water, and more like molten emerald. Or aquamarine, depending on the mood of Mother Nature on that particular day. The sunsets bring colours to the horizon that are more resplendent than your grandest dreams, and there is literally no moment that is not Instagram-worthy. That you may feel too lost in the moment to remember your phone is another matter.
The beauty, of course, makes the Maldives a perfect destination to visit with your beloved, but what makes this country even more amazing is the diversity of experiences it can house in its tiny islands. It caters to lovers, friends and families, adventure junkies, photographers - you name it!
Here's a quick list of things you can do during your stay in paradise -
See the world's smallest capital city!
With an area of only 5.8 sq. km., Male is walkable from end to end, although if you'd rather get a taxi, you can do that at a reasonably flat rate to go anywhere on the island. While Male itself is not designed for tourism, it seems, there's a different vibe to this small city with a big heart that you can spend a few hours enjoying.
Experience a speedboat or seaplane ride
Depending on how far from the airport your hotel is, you will be taking either a speedboat or a seaplane to get there. While this is considered more transportation, less recreation, since it is the only means to get where you have to go, it sure will remind you that there is "fun" in functional.
Sail, snorkel, scuba dive - and more!
A plethora of water sports and other activities are experienced at their best in the Maldives. If you just want to relax, take a paddle-boat and bob around the sea, and if you're up for something more adventurous, dive into the clearest waters, or snorkel around little fish and the reef, or go surfing or parasailing. There are a tonne more activities and you can take your pick!
All underwater everything
If snorkeling and scuba diving don't satisfy the water baby you are, you can also choose to dine or have a spa day underwater.
Shark and dolphin spotting
These magnificent creatures enjoy the beautiful waters and you can go to the viewing point at the right time of the day and spot them frolicking around.
Follow a see-food diet
...which means you see food, and you eat it! The islanders have picked up some serious culinary skills and cook up a good meal in every cuisine. Sea food, of course, has an edge here, so pescetarians are definitely advised to order a variety of the local food.
Explore the stay options
While Maldives has been known as a luxury destination because of the high-end properties here, there are a number of more affordable options that are worth every penny, and give you access to the same natural beauty that an expensive 5 star would. An interesting initiative by the government allows you to stay with the locals on some islands, but if that's too intimate for you, you can always look at reasonable hotel and guest house stays.?
Go ahead, click the hyperlink above. It is guaranteed to take you to a myriad of stay options, all of which are carefully picked out for the busy Traveler.
Vistarooms.lk not only identifies accommodation options that are unique and tasteful, but it also allows you to sort your lodging according to budget, distance and amenities.

Narcissism in the House
	
?
There are occasions when the proceedings in the august assembly are televised live and it invariably happens whenever a VIP either from the government or the opposition takes the floor. Whenever such a key figure rises to his feet to address the council, there are three young members who have made it a habit to scramble for the vacant seats behind the speaker expecting to get into the focus of video cameras to be turned on him.
?
This mad scramble by the young narcissistic members though frowned upon by some, provides much amusement to the senior members of the council.
Leading the narcissistic trio is a fresher from Gampaha. The other two hail from Kurunegala and Uva respectively, they say.

Despite the current practice to call for tenders and additional funds for new projects, the Road Development Authority (RDA) said yesterday that additional funds would not be allocated to paint the zebra crossings white.
The RDA said all zebra crossings would be re-painted white from December 3.
RDA Chairman Nihal Sooriyaarachchi said they did not want to spend more than was necessary on the project, which had prompted the use of the funds that were already allocated for the purpose.
?We could have called for a tender and spent more money on this but we don?t want to do that. That is why we have requested a year to complete the project,? Mr. Sooriyaarachchi said. (Darshana Sanjeewa)

Rajitha contradicts Wijeyadasa
	
While rejecting Justice Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakse's recent statement in Parliament that some 32 Sri Lankan youths had joined the IS, Cabinet spokesman Minister Rajitha Senaratne today said that the statement was completely incorrect and misleading.
Addressing the weekly cabinet press briefing in Parliament, Minister Senaratne said according to the armed forces intelligence reports, only four Muslim youths had joined the IS but they have joined the militant group from abroad.
?I have reliable intelligence reports that the information given to Minister Rajapakse was not correct. But unfortunately, the statement made by Minister Rajapakse in Parliament recently has created a confusion and anxiety among the Muslim community in Sri Lanka. Someone has given him misleading information. Not a single Muslim youth joined IS directly from Sri Lanka,? Minister Senaratne said.
He said the government must create confidence among the Muslim community as 90% of Muslims are a moderate and passive community and only 10% of Muslim youths are prone to fall into extremist ideologies and added whoever comes to Sri Lanka with the ruse that they are coming here to propagate Muslim, they are screened by the NIB (National Intelligence Bureau).
Minister Senaratne said some 30 shocked and distressed Muslim organizations over the remarks made by Minister Rajapaksa representing the entire Muslim community in Sri Lanka had sought a discussion with him to sort out the issue and he would meet them shortly after briefing President Maithripala Sirisena.
He charged that the joint opposition was in a dastardly move to create communal disharmony by inciting Muslims and Tamils in the South, East and North with the sinister motive to block Muslim and Tamil votes for the SLFP or the UNP in a future election as they think they could win elections only from Sinhala Buddhist votes which will be their waterloo.
Responding to a journalist on the military conspiracy theory suggested by Parliamentarian Dinesh Gunawardane, Minister Senaratne said it was the most malicious and vengeful statement made by a Sri Lankan politician ever. (Sandun A Jayasekera)

Shane Warne FB video earns cricketers seatbelt fines
	
Former Test cricketers Shane Warne, Kevin Pietersen and Michael Slater have been fined $300 (?177) for not wearing seatbelts after Warne posted a video of them in a moving car.
The four-minute Facebook video was filmed after day three of Australia's Test match against South Africa, where the men had been working as TV pundits.
Towards the end of the footage, the trio all put their belts on.
But Tasmania police were alerted to the infringement and reviewed the video.
In a statement, the authorities said: "Tasmania police remind motorists that seatbelts save lives and urge drivers to insist their passengers buckle up too."
Former Australian captain Mark Taylor was driving the van and former wicketkeeper Ian Healy was a passenger in the front seat, but both were wearing seatbelts.(BBC)

Some breach the precepts they preach to others
	
?
It has now become a normal practice for politicos with status at national level to do duty-free shopping far in excess of their duty-free entitlements.
?
Recently there was much talk about a deputy purohita who had to pay a fine plus duty on an expensive TV set he had taken away with no initial trouble through the VIP channel.?
Meanwhile, a story making rounds says that a Diyawanna member holding some secretarial status in a Red party too dodged paying duty due on an expensive curve TV set bought from a duty-free shop at the Katunayake airport.
This Red Diyawanna member had bought the TV set worth Rs.900,000 for Rs.200,000 and had taken it through the VIP departure channel straight to a waiting car outside the gate without paying the duty due on it to the Customs.?
Some people breach the very precepts they preach to others,?they say.

UN creates LGBT expert post; SL votes in favour
	
Sri Lanka was among the 84 countries which defeated a draft resolution put forward by African states calling for the suspension of work of the first ever UN independent investigator appointed to help protect lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex (LGBTI) people from violence and discrimination.
Sri Lanka, Cambodia, Mongolia, Thailand, Vietnam, Turkey and Korean Republic were among the 84 countries which voted in favour of the counter-amendment.
According to the Guardian, the 47-member UN Human Rights Council created the position in June and in September appointed Vitit Muntarbhorn of Thailand, who has a three-year mandate to investigate abuses against lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex (LGBTI) people.
Meanwhile, African states put forward a draft resolution in the UN general assembly third committee, which deals with human rights, calling for consultations on the legality of the creation of the mandate. They said the work of the investigator should be suspended.
However, western countries successfully proposed an amendment that gutted the African group draft resolution. The amendment was adopted in the third committee on Monday with 84 votes in favour, 77 against and 17 abstentions.
The amended draft resolution, which makes no change to the work of the gay rights investigator, was then adopted by the third committee with 94 votes in favor, three against and 80 abstentions.
Russia and Egypt, speaking on behalf of the 57-member Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, said they would not recognize the mandate of the gay rights investigator and would not cooperate with Muntarbhorn. Britain urged all countries to cooperate with the investigator.
Being gay is a crime in at least 73 countries, the UN has said. The issue of gay rights consistently sparks heated debate at the United Nations.
In 2014, UN chief Ban Ki-moon said the UN would recognize all same-sex marriages of its staff, allowing them to receive UN benefits. Russia unsuccessfully tried to overturn it last year, with Saudi Arabia, China, Iran, India, Egypt, Pakistan and Syria among 43 states that supported Moscow.
In February the African Group, the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation and the 25-member Group of Friends of the Family, led by Egypt, Belarus and Qatar, protested the launch of six UN stamps promoting LGBT equality.
Then a group of 51 Muslim states blocked 11 gay and transgender organizations from officially attending a high-level UN meeting in June on ending AIDS, sparking a protest by the United States, Canada and the European Union.

UN HR Committee orders SL to pay compensation
	
The United Nations (UN) Human Rights Committee had officially informed the Sri Lankan Government yesterday of its decision to order the government to pay compensations to a Canadian man who was allegedly tortured in Sri Lanka.
The UN Committee had reached its decision last week.
According to foreign media reports, the 46-year-old Roy Samathanam had been arrested by the Terrorist Investigation Division (TID) on charges of having links with the LTTE.
Samathanam had allegedly been tortured during his detention in custody from 2007 to 2010 and forced to sign a confession which said that he was involved with the LTTE.
He had arrived in Canada after he was released from custody in 2010. The Canadian Centre for International Justice had assisted Samathanam to file a complaint with the UN Human Rights Committee.
According to reports, Sri Lanka has been given a time period of 180 days by the Committee, within which it should report back on the steps taken in connection with the committee?s decision.
When contacted by Daily Mirror, the Foreign Affairs Ministry said that they had been informed of the decision and that the incident should be examined by the authorities, such as the Justice Ministry and the Attorney General?s Department.
?It?s too early make further comments,? Ministry Spokesperson Mahishini Colonne said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

US Marines train recently formed SLN Marine Corps
	
US Marines and Sailors will participate in a training exercise with Sri Lanka Navy sailors and members of the newly formed Marine Corps off the coast of Trincomalee this week.
The U.S. Marines and Sailors of the 11th Marine Expeditionary Unit embarked aboard amphibious transport dock ?USS Somerset?, which arrived at the Trincomalee Port yesterday, for an exchange programme on Theater Security Cooperation (TSC). The programme is scheduled to be held from November 23- 25. ?
Speaking to the Daily Mirror, Navy Spokesman Akram Alavi said the Sri Lankan Marine Corps had been formed just six months ago. ?The members have only been trained locally so far and all of them are members of the Navy,? he said.? ?
The military exchange will focus on enhancing relationships between the two naval services, and honing basic military skills and small boat operations that could support humanitarian assistance and disaster relief missions.
Additionally, the TSC will provide an opportunity for U.S. Marines to pass to their newly-formed counterparts in Sri Lanka the fundamentals of being a marine, and what sets them apart from soldiers or sailors.
"We look forward to working alongside the Sri Lankan marines, and sharing the characteristics and ethos of our Marine Corps," said Col. Clay C. Tipton, commanding officer, 11th MEU. "Simply put, U.S. Marines are known for taking care of their own, demonstrating a bias for action, and having an unwavering devotion to mission accomplishment."
The TSC training includes basic defensive tactics, combat life-saving skills, explosive ordnance disposal, aircraft familiarization, small boat and convoy operations, and small unit leadership classes.
"Any time we can work and train with partner and allied militaries, it lays a foundation for future cooperation," said Capt. Darren Glaser, Somerset's commanding officer. "These engagements build the relationships and trust needed for cooperative responses to regional crises."
The Makin Island Amphibious Ready Group/11th MEU units involved are Somerset; Company A, Battalion Landing Team 1st Bn., 4th Marines; UH-1Y Huey and AH-1Z Cobra sections from Marine Medium Tiltrotor Squadron 163 (Reinforced); Combat Logistics Det. 112, Combat Logistics Battalion 11; and a platoon from the Maritime Raid Force.
The MKI ARG/11th MEU provides senior U.S. military leadership and coalition partners with a flexible force which can rapidly respond to contingencies and crises within a region. With ships, aircraft, troops, and logistical equipment, the ARG/MEU is a self-contained and self-sustained task force capable of conducting everything from combat operations to providing humanitarian assistance.

World?s tallest ever X-mas Tree to come up on Galle Face Green
	
?
Now that the festive season is round the corner, a top team member in yahapalanaya has taken the initiative to build the world?s tallest Christmas Tree.?
?
A large gang of workers are busy making the Tree on the Galle Face Green these days. Although it has been announced that the project would not involve the use of public funds, reliable sources say that both human and material resources of the Ministry are being utilized in covert ways.?
Employees at the Colombo port, they say, openly express their surprise and displeasure at the X-mas Tree project saying that the Ministry high-ups have undertaken an ?unnecessary decorative exercise? when they should concentrate on turning the Ministry?s loss-making establishments into profit-making ones.
