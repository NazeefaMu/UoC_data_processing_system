Assault not cause of Embilipitiya youth?s death: JMO?s report
	
The second Judicial Medical Officer?s (JMO) report on Sumith Prasanna Jayawardane?s death at Embilipitiya during a clash with the Police had revealed that his death was due to excessive bleeding and not because of injuries caused by being assaulted or being pushed.
Counsel Anuja Premaratne, appearing for former Embilipitiya Police ASP C. Dharmaratne, conveyed this to Embilipitiya High Court Judge Kumari Abeyratne today.
He said according to the report, the injuries were identified as cut injuries and these injuries could happen when attempting to go through a glass door.
Earlier, the JMO report prepared by Ratnapura Hospital?s Medical Officer T.B. Gunatilake said Sumith Prasanna?s death was due to severe shock caused by excessive bleeding from cut injuries. (Ajithlal Shantha Udaya)

Athulathmudali killing: Brother seeks fresh probe
	
Dayantha Athulathmudali, - brother of late Minister Lalith Athulathmudali who was killed in April 1993 - yesterday called for a fresh probe on his brother?s killing.
?Twenty years have gone since the killing of my brother and I would like to request a probe on his killing as his killing will go down in history as a mystery just like the killings of journalists Lasantha Wickramatunga and Prageeth Ekanligoda,? Mr. Athulathmudali said speaking at the Lalith Athulathmudali memorial lecture last evening.
He also requested the government to expand the Mahapola scheme founded by his late brother so that scholarships could be given to those who wish to engage in post graduate studies.
Recalling his experience during the funeral of his brother, Mr Athulathmudali related how tear gas was fired at the funeral procession. ?We had to shed tears even before we reached the cemetery that day as tear gas was fired at us,? he recalled.
Coming up with some unknown facts about his brother, Mr Athulathmudali said the late Singaporean Prime Minister offered late Lalith Athulathmudali citizenship of his country and a ministerial post in his government. ? Mr Atulathmudali would have been living today had he agreed to the request made by Late Singaporean Prime Minister to give up Sri Lankan citizenship and take up citizenship in Singapore,? he said.
Further Mr. Athulathmudali recalled how his brother reacted to the decision of the government of 1987 to call off the Wadamarachchi operation when the security forces were closed to capture LTTE leader Prabahakaran. ? My brother was in a mental distress when I visited him that day as he used a four letter word to refer to the then President and I told him to calm down. I told him to calm down as he should be diligent in what he did being a product of Oxford University,? he said. (Yohan Perera)

BBS challenges Wimal, other MPs to debate
	
Bodu Bala Sena (BBS) General Secretary Ven. Galagodaatte Gnanasara Thera today challenged MP Wimal Weerawansa over the statements he made to the media condemning the organisation.
?I will challenge not only MP Wimal Weerawansa but also Mahindananda Aluthgamage, Manusha Nanayakkara, Dilan Perera, Rajitha Senarathne, Mangala Samaraweera and political analysts Gevindu Kumarathunga and Dayan Jayathileke for an open debate to discuss the statements made by them against the BBS,? the Thera said.
?They are claiming that BBS is funded by Norway and it is a conspiracy of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). If there?s a CIA conspiracy and if we are funded by Norway, there should be investigations against us to find out the truth. If anyone funded us, there should be bank accounts and bills related to any transaction relating to those transactions. The BBS is funded by the innocent Sri Lankan Buddhists becase the work that we are doing is done for their sake. Unfortunately it is sad to say that several ministers were willing to making statements without knowing anything about the BBS,? he said.
?Democracy is not saying lies and it is not a privilege given by Parliament to ministers. What we discussed in the previous government is valid even for this ?Yahapalana? government. They were the people who shouted at us when we exposed incidents which were threat to national security and they did nothing,? the Thera said.
?We have not taken a penny from any government or NGO to build up the BBS. We are not the reason for the defeat of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa. Now he is reaping what he sowed,? the Thera said. (Chaturaga Pradeep)

Panama Papers: Senadhipathi denies allegations
	
Avant-Garde Chairman Nissanka Senadhipathi today denied holding funds in Panama as published and presented in the media and social media websites, his counsel Nishan Premathiratne said.
Mr. Premathiratne said his client's earnings from Avant-garde Maritime Services Pvt. Ltd were in foreign currency.
?My client informed me that if even a dollar was found in a Panama account held by him as represented by the media, he would gladly donate it to the founder,? he said.
Mr. Sendhipathi has said that the persons who have held public office should be specifically probed if they are alleged to have Panama accounts so as to verify the sources of the said earnings.
Mr. Premathiratne said his client was concerned as to why his name was highlighted and slandered when there were many other names mentioned in the Panama papers.
?He is surprised that most importantly the persons who should in fact be highlighted are the persons who have held public office and he is of the view that they are the ones who should be scrutinized and investigated,? Mr. Premathiratne said.
He said Mr. Senadhipathi had requested the media to be mindful when reporting information about him or his company claiming he has already been a victim of several frivolous and unsubstantiated allegations. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

?Some rascals have called her and said various things about me,? said the purohita.
?What is it about, Sir??

SL man caught in bid to travel to Canada with fake IDs
	
A Sri Lanka national has been caught attempting to travel to Canada via Taiwan using fake Canadian identification cards, the National Immigration Agency (NIA) said Tuesday.
The 24-year-old man was discovered by immigrant agents at Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport late Monday to be holding a fake Canadian permanent resident card when he was waiting for a transit flight to Toronto, the agency said.
A fake Canadian citizenship card, health card and driver's license were seized from his luggage after a search, according to the NIA.
When questioned by the immigration agents, the man said he was a truck driver in Sri Lanka and was planning to work in Canada, where the pay is much better.
He disclosed that a human trafficking ring had helped him arrange the trip for a price equivalent to about NT$120,000 (US$3,690). He had made a transit stop in Singapore before arriving in Taiwan.
The man was repatriated back to Sri Lanka after questioning, the NIA said. (focustaiwan)

Thewarapperuma incident: Education ministry to investigate
	
Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam has instructed ministry officials to conduct an investigation into the incident where Deputy Minister Palitha Thewarapperuma is alleged to have forced the Kalutara Vidyalaya Principal to enroll a child to Grade-one.
The deputy minister had reportedly accompanied a child and his mother to the Kalutara Vidyalaya on Monday and is alleged to have forced the principal to enroll the child.
The principal informed the minister that he could not enroll the child as he was not in the admission list. However, the child was later enrolled to the school despite the principal's decision.
Meanwhile, the All Ceylon Teachers' Union (ACTU) Secretary Joseph Stalin condemned the political influence exerted by the deputy minister to have the child enrolled.
?It sets a bad example when the politician does not take proper steps in such a situation but tries to have the child forcibly admitted to school. This is an issue faced by many children in the country. We condemn the method adopted by the deputy minister,? he said.
"The circular on admission to grade-one is what needs to be amended," Mr. Stalin said.(Darshana Sanjeewa)
