1500-day economic plan another failed project: JO
	
The Joint Oppositions economic research unit yesterday charged that the 1,500-day economic plan which was expected to be announced within the next two weeks by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, would be another unsuccessful project of the government.
Addressing a media briefing, joint opposition member MP Bandula Gunawardana said the fate of the 1,500-day economic plan of the government would be the same as its hundred day programme of Good Governance.
The government has failed in every endeavor it has tried to do so far. Mr. Wickremesinghe is directly announcing his proposal as it is a concept of the United National Party (UNP). These kinds of plans are not accepted by the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP), he added.
He said the 1,500-day economic plan put forward by Mr. Wickremesinghe would be an unrealistic move and only a blended development could be expected from such plans.
Meanwhile, the joint opposition requested for a presidential commission from President Maithripala Sirisena to probe the Central Bank bond issue, causing a financial loss of Rs.1.6 billion to the treasury.
He said Perpetual Treasuries Limited, the controversial primary dealer connected to the family of the former Central Bank Governor, Arjuna Mahendran, has made an profit after-tax of Rs. 5.1 billion which has exceeded the annual profit rate of a local bank.
Commenting on the merging of Mihin Lanka with SriLankan Airlines from October 30, he said the Government was on a mission to sell all the local-based companies to fulfill the agreement struck with the International Monetary Fund (IMF). (Kalathma Jayawardhane)

For him, Green is like a red rag to a bull
	

A group of Green party supporters who had taken the initiative to accord a public reception to a certain political leader at Pelmadulla have been placed in a dilemma following an order received from a powerful white-collar bigwig to dismantle the pandal erected in connection with the ceremony. He had also given a call to an MP in the area not to allow the pandal to come up. 

This bigwig attached to the office of a very high political authority had gone livid with anger on hearing that the picture of a non-Blue party leader is prominently displayed at the apex of the pandal which is painted entirely in green.
By the way, the organizers had already got clearance for erecting the pandal from the law enforcement authorities.
The powerful bigwig who had earlier held a commission in the army had worked in this office even under the former strongman, they say.

Good looks pay good dividends
	

This young girl got her appointment as an assistant to a white-collar high up in an august establishment only two months ago. Nevertheless, she has been included in a team of officials selected for a foreign tour over the heads of many seniors counting long years in service.

The selection of this young girl for the foreign tour, a kind which is normally meant for senior executives has raised many an eyebrow and caused much discontent among the staff, they say.
The post to which the lucky girl has now been appointed was earlier held by a senior lady who had been suddenly moved out to make way for the former.
Staffers are said to be often discussing the injustice done to the senior lady and some of them would even poke fun at her for losing a coveted foreign trip to a fresher. And the lady would shrug off the remarks that the colleagues make in fun saying: After all, she is more attractive and I dont grudge her good luck.

A high authority of a state body connected to travel has received a complaint that a certain white-collar bigwig of the institution had tried to outrage the modesty of the better half of another official of the same place while riding together in the elevator.

It has come to light since the complaint made, that this bigwig had sexually harassed several other fair ones too inside the lift cage on previous occasions. However, these victims had kept quiet for fear of reprisals, they say. However, so far no action has been taken against the sex maniac. The reason for this, say the employees, is that the high authority himself is a Casanova who is in the habit of taking pleasure rides with a comely cutie even during the office hours!

ISIS mastermind poisoned by mystery assassin
	
The ISIS leader was poisoned alongside three of his commanders after all four consumed spiked meals in the Be'aaj district, southwest of Mosul in Iraq, according to Iraqi news agency WAA.
Al-Baghdadi, who is often credited with creating ISIS, has been rushed to "an unknown location under strict measures" along with his henchmen.
The depraved jihadi group is said to have arrested several suspects who it believes are undermining the self-proclaimed caliphate.
Al-Baghdadi is a powerful figure in the group and has evaded capture despite a rigorous US campaign offering a staggering $10million reward for information leading to his capture or death.
Earlier this year, he was reported to have been killed by US airstrikes targeting Raqqa, where he was believed to be living with US hostage Kayla Mueller - a 26-year-old aid worker al-Baghdadi kept locked up in a dungeon as a sex slave.
But the reports of the ultra-Jihadis death were inaccurate and the hunt for the ISIS mastermind continued.
Last week, footage emerged of the terrorist lowlife issuing a last-ditch appeal to sick jihadis worldwide insisting they remain loyal to the group despite its loss of territory in Iraq and Syria.
Al-Baghdadi said: "Our Muslim community is passing through a difficult time in its journey.
This period has seen a massive change to its journey going all the way back through the history of the Caliphate.
The breaking of the Sykes/Picko borders has allowed jihadists to begin appearing across the Islamic world and inside their own countries.
Because of this everyone will be, and is, against us.
The Mujaheddin are still in the Caliphate today, and those that are connected to it are still fighting for the Muslim Revolution.
Al-Baghdadi's poisoning comes as a fresh blow to ISIS, which is preparing to fight US troops in a showdown battle in Syria, which the terrorists believe will trigger the apocalypse.
Turkish troops, backed by the US, are currently circling the tiny town of Dabiq in preparation for what ISIS has dubbed the "major apocalyptic showdown with the infidel". (Express.co.uk)

Lion Brewery permitted to import beer without import taxes- FM
	
The Finance Ministry yesterday said that Lion Brewery Ltd in Biyagama has been permitted to import beer for a period of three months and imposed taxes and other levies equal to that of locally manufactured beer at the point of importation instead of import taxes and other levies.
The Ministry sent the following clarification on the news item which Daily Mirror carried on October 3, 2016 under the title Monks up in Arms against import tax concession on beer.
This beer manufacturing company in the country which was fully affected by the recent flood has been provided the opportunity to import beer with taxes and other levies applicable to that of locally produced beer.
The manufacturing plant and machinery of M/s Lion Brewery Company at Biyagama was completely damaged due to the recent flood in the area. This company which pays excise and other levies of over Rs.25 billion annually to the government had made a request to the treasury for a tax concession for up to a period of three months.
This company was manufacturing beer locally which was subject to an excise duty of Rs.190 per liter for alcohol volume less than 5 per cent and Rs.315 per litre for alcohol volume more than 5 per cent.
Since their manufacturing plant was fully destroyed they were unable to manufacture beer locally and they could not afford to import and sell the goods at the current market price given the fact that the import duties alone exceed the market price. The company had made a request for a waiver on excise duty and other levies to import consignment required for a period of three months. As of now the all inclusive levies for import of Beer exceeds Rs.700 per liter in addition to CIF cost of Rs.100 per litre. Accordingly, the import cost will exceed the market price compelling the company to give up the production.
Therefore considering all these facets the government in order to match the market price, permitted the company to import beer, required for a period of three months and impose taxes and other levies equal to that of locally manufactured beer at the point of importation instead of import taxes and other levies.

Six containers of refuse tea valued at Rs. 10.8 million which had been recalled to Colombo from a ship in Dubai en route to Iraq was seized by the customs today, Customs Spokesman Dharmasena Kahandawa said.
The ship had left Colombo harbour few months ago after which the customs officials had decided to recheck the contents of the six containers.
The 40 foot container shipment was declared to the customs as having coconut fibre.
The contents of the containers were confirmed to be refuse tea on being checked by the Customs Clearance Unit.
The consignment was unfit for human consumption, Mr. Dharmasena said.
He said that the Customs Department had details of four persons believed to be involved on this racket and one suspect had already been arrested. The suspect were remanded for further questioning, he said.
Each container had 18 tons of refuse tea, he said.
The refuse tea was mainly packed from Kurunegala, Narammala and the Welamboda area in Kandy.
The suspects used to export these containers using the Customs Green Channel facility. Only five percent of exports were examined under the Green Channel facility. The smugglers had been using this for their illegal exports, Dharmasena said.
Meanwhile, addressing the media Customs Superintendent Sudath Silva said around 80 containers had been intercepted with refused tea since 2013 and generally the shipments had been found declared as coconut fibre and food stuff.
The investigation was conducted by the Customs Preventive Unit Superintendent Sudath de Silva, Deputy Customs Director Jayanta Buddhadasa and Ranjith Kumarasinghe, Assistant Superintendents Aruna Amarasinghe, Udara Jayasanka, Praveen Indranama, Ranga Liyanage, Sameera Jayasinghe, Amila Sanjeewa and Nadeeka Herath.

SAARC failure compels SL to find other options: PM
	
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe has said that the failure of SAARC to deliver "acceptable results" for all members would compel Sri Lanka to find other "viable options".
Mr. Wickremesinghe's remark assumes significance as Sri Lanka was one of the five SAARC member-states which sided with India in pulling out of the summit scheduled in Islamabad on November 9-10 over an attack on an Indian army base in Uri on September 18 by Pakistan-based terrorists, PTI said.
Delivering a lecture on 'Sri Lanka and its Place in the World" at the New Zealand Parliament House in Auckland on Monday, the Premier has said that following the Uri attack, the 19th SAARC Summit in Islamabad has been postponed.
"This year's SAARC Summit is in jeopardy due to the war prevailing on the border. However, as the SAARC plays an important role, carrying out the Summit is a matter of great importance," he said.
"I explained that while the failure of SAARC to deliver acceptable results for all members would spell out a bleak future, it would also compel Sri Lanka to look towards other viable options," he said.
He, however, did not elaborate what he meant by "other viable options" but had said it was "imperative" that Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) nations work together to improve regional cooperation.
Mr. Wickremesinghe recalled the 1985 SAARC Summit when Sri Lanka proposed countering border terrorism as an issue, but he rued it was ultimately not agreed upon due to disagreements among member-states.
He sought a simple plan from SAARC members which could be agreed upon to move forward in the light of the situation.

SDB Bank honours senior citizens on Intl Older Persons Day
	
SDB Bank has unveiled a special loan scheme to honour the senior citizens on the UNs International Day of Older Persons.
This is part of the banks programme to reorient its services to offer a more meaningful service to the public. A new logo was also launched recently to better reflect SDB Banks new orientation towards a closer and more efficient partnership with the public.
Nearly 13 percent of Sri Lankas population is over 60 years old. The trend shows that by 2020, this population will increase up to 15.7 percent, by 2030 to 22 percent and by 2050 it will reach 28.5 percent. While this is true of many countries around the world, it is the reason for the statement that the world has an ageing population.
At present, Sri Lanka has over 575,000 retired government employees and this figure is expected to rise closer to the one million mark by 2025. An analysis of statistics shows that 2 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) is allocated for the payment of government pensions. If this segment of the population is not deployed for economically productive activities, it will be an obstacle to the countrys progress.
SDB Bank, which has well understood this situation, has ventured into economic development activities by formulating the Upahara loan scheme in order to address this matter in an effective manner. Its objective is to provide an opportunity for those who have retired from service due to old age to re-enter the countrys workforce. Under this scheme, a loan of up to Rs.1.5 million would be made available with the repayment period extended till the age of 70 years.
While the loan repayment period will be seven years, the borrowers will also benefit from a loan insurance scheme. This loan insurance scheme will be available with a minimal premium and is unique in that, in the event of the demise of the borrower, the spouse and the dependents will not be liable for settling the loan. While no guarantors are required for this purpose, these loan facilities are available for any activity that is legal and productive for the country.
SDB Bank also provides a 15 percent annual interest rate on a one-year fixed deposit for senior citizens as per the regulations of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka. The bank has also taken steps to offer the senior citizens a higher than normal interest rate on other fixed deposits as well.
Retirees are ones with an invaluable wealth of experience having worked over a long period in a specific profession. Through this loan scheme they will be able to transform their experience in a productive manner to a business or self-employment. They will greatly benefit by the fact that the loan interest rate for self-employment will be between 5 percent and 8 percent. These are very competitive rates in the context of the current market conditions. There is no doubt that the retirees will also benefit by better mental and physical health due to engaging in such a business activity.
Through SDB Banks Upahara loan scheme, the retired citizens will have the opportunity to run ones own business without being a burden to the children. They will be able to interact socially while opening the way for the livelihood of some others and contribute to the economic activity of the country as well.
While the retired citizens who deposit their pension to an account at SDB Bank will be able to avail of these loan facilities, they will be able enjoy value-added services such as withdraw money from any ATM with the VISA logo and SMS banking service. Facilities have been provided for senior citizens to obtain information on products and services at any time through the trilingual call centre.

Twelve bottles did  the trick
	

A local politico backing the yahapalanaya had attended a protest staged by a group of peasants in Rajarata recently. Soon after reaching the venue of the protest, he had contacted a high political authority on behalf of the protesting peasants.

The local politico was a bit shaken by the curt reply he received from the political authority who had demanded what he was doing at this anti-government protest. I say, we cant change the government policies every time a protest is held. You had better leave the place and mind your own business.
The politico found himself between the devil and the deep blue sea. He could not afford to defy the orders given by the political high-up. Nor could he let down the peasants who were his mainstay in politics. So he had immediately sought the advice of a close friend on how he could retain the support of the peasants without antagonizing the powerful political high-up.
Dont worry, Machang, said the friend. Theres a simple solution to your problem: Get back home and send some bottles to the protesters.
The local politico who immediately got back home had sent 12 bottles to the protesters and that had saved the situation.

US Green Card Lottery 2018 opens for Sri Lankans
	
The application period for the 2018 Diversity Visa Program (DV-2018) also known as Green Card Lottery offered by the US would be commenced tonight from 9.30 till November 7 same time, for the applicants from Sri Lanka and Maldives, the US Embassy in Colombo said today.
The programme would be open for online registration for free of charge and eligible applicants would be randomly selected at the first phase of the procedure.
Once selected, the applicants would be called for an interview. Unless an applicant is called for an interview, there is no requirement to make a payment. For the interview, a fee of USD 330 would be charged, Deputy Consular Officer of the Embassy David Wagner told a news conference.
He said the DV was offered for immigrants to become legal permanent residents (LPR) of the US. Commenting on the process of the lottery, he said the applicants who registered this year would be interviewed in 2017 and would receive Green Cards in 2018, if selected.
This is a great opportunity to work and live in the US legally. Those who have successfully passed the GCE A/L examination, have a degree from an approved university or have two years of minimum work experience in certain occupations are eligible to apply. Any applicant, born in Sri Lanka or Maldives, should make sure that they have fulfilled all criteria prior to apply, Wagner said.
He said applicants could go online to the Entrant Status Check page on www.dvlottery. state. gov May next year to see if they had been selected for the DV program.
Under the second phase, the applicants who were selected would be asked to submit additional information and would be notified when they are selected for an interview.
The in-person interview would be held with a US Consular Officer, who will decide if the applicant is eligible to receive the visa, he said and warned applicants to beware of scams, of persons or companies which claim to offers Green Card Visa.
Consular Wagner said applicants could only send in one application as multiple entries would result in disqualification and advised to keep with them the application confirmation number received after applying.
A total of 50,000 individual applications had been received from Sri Lanka for the lottery programme last year and about 200-400 applicants had been selected.
The Embassy requested applicants to reach US Embassy Colombos website at https://lk.usembassy.gov/visas/immigrant-visas/diversity-visa/ to find out more about the program, including qualification requirements and detailed instructions on how to apply in Sinhala, Tamil, and English.
