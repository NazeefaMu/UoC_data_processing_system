Criminalising Hate Speech: Govt's minority allies seek written assurance
	
Political parties representing the minority communities in the ruling coalition are seeking a written assurance from the government to conduct the provincial council elections without further delay, far-reaching constitutional amendments and the criminalisation of hate speech, a minister said yesterday.
Tamil Progressive Party Leader and Minister, Mano Ganesan told Daily Mirror that parties such as the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress (SLMC) and the All Ceylon Makkal Congress (ACMC) would seek a written agreement from the government in this regard.
The minister said any constitutional amendment should cover the executive presidency, electoral reforms and political solution to the North and the East as a whole and that these parties would urge the government to amend the Penal Code to criminalize hate speech.
Commenting on the provincial council elections, he said these elections should be conducted without further delay.
?They should be conducted under the old system of proportional representation. After May Day we will submit our request to the government,? the minister said. (Kelum Bandara)

## Title: Elvis the Pelvis, Madonna?s White Lace, Ajith?s Blues and our tame pop
## Section: News Features

Elvis the Pelvis, Madonna?s White Lace, Ajith?s Blues and our tame pop
	
Music is there to entertain? It is also there to rebel, as a highly potent means of protest. This is true of Beethoven?s Ninth Symphony as well as Elvis Presley, Chuck Berry and Rock n? Roll. It has been said that rock music played? a key role? in bringing down the Berlin Wall, and that?s very true.
Beethoven, a musical rebel to the core, threw the rule book to the winds and wrote music which epitomized his political idealism, as well as eventual disillusionment, and we can see this process clearly in the nine majestic symphonies he wrote. But classical music remains esoteric to the masses and its folk music and pop which speaks to the heart of the common man and woman. Folk music has been a? medium of protest against social injustice down the ages, all over the world. The rebellious side of pop may be less obvious, but it is very much there, to body gyrations of Elvis to the guitar burning of Jimi Hendrix.?
The protest can come in many forms, from the dress, make up and? instrumentation to the lyrics. ?Protest? and ?rebellion? doesn?t always mean a call to arms. Pop musicians, being what they are, have rebelled against convention, which includes conventional morality. That is what ?Elvis the Pelvis? was about. What he didn?t say in so many words, he demonstrated with clear body language, and Chuck Berry?s duck walk, cool manner and outlandish guitar playing helped break down racial barriers in the segregated American South.
Two other ?non extreme? examples come to mind: Glen Campbell?s ?Try A Little Kindness? and ?Just Another Day in Paradise? by Phil Collins, which is really about degrading poverty in the Third World. Even Michael Jackson?s ?Heal The World? can be interpreted as an anti-war song?and a passionate?appeal for peace
?
All over the world, pop music has been a liberating influence, helping bring about more relaxed modes of behaviour for the young and alarming peer groups and the established order. Rock music was banned in much of the former Soviet bloc, as it is now in many Islamic fundamentalist states (check out MTV?s Rebel Music series).
But protest music isn?t always in-your-face. Pete Seeger?s celebrated anti-war song ?Where Have All the Flowers Gone? remains? unmatched since for its gentle lyricism,? simple yet compulsive imagery and beauty of melody. Seeger fashioned his anti-establishment songs out of folk roots.??
Two other ?non extreme? examples come to mind: Glen Campbell?s ?Try A Little Kindness? and ?Just Another Day in Paradise? by Phil Collins, which is really about degrading poverty in the Third World. Even Michael Jackson?s ?Heal The World? can be interpreted as an anti-war song and a passionate appeal for peace.
?Winds of Change? by the Scorpions is more about the dramatic changes wrought in Gorbachev?s USSR in which the underground pop and rock so hated by the Soviet regime played such a key role (a tradition continued by the contemporary all-girl group Pussy Riot who attack Putin and the orthodox church). Then there are non Western singers such as Bob Marley,? Miriam Makeba and Eddie Grant who, in their particular contexts, protested against poverty, hunger and political oppression.
I have often wondered why we don?t have a tradition of protest songs. Our folk songs are full of pathos, yearning, sentimentality and humour, but there is hardly any rage against oppression. Come to modern times, our pop music is tender, sentimental, sad and then again full of joy. But there is nothing burning down there, no sense of outrage at the standing order. It?s rather tame pop music.
Someone can quip that we are not Westerners. But rebellion isn?t anything Western.? Our entire history is one of constant rebellion and bloodbaths. Our post-independence history isn?t any more cheerful. But our music (except the drumming) and especially the song have never been seen as a form of protest and mass communication. This is very odd especially in modern times. Elements of it can be found in Baila (from Anton John to Sunil Perera), but these are exceptions to the rule. When Clarence Wijewardane sings: ?Api baila kiyanawa, poyata siluth gannawa, randuth wenawa?? (we can sing baila, and quarrel, too, just as we become pious on Poya Day) it?s a sardonic self-assessment and heartfelt lament from a pop demi-god to the musical rebel that he? could not be.
The debut of Madonna?s ?Like a Virgin? has to be remembered with her shocking stage attire ? she sang and danced on stage in white lace, the yin version of Elvis Presley?s shiny silver outfits and pelvic thrusting
This is in stark contrast to parts of Asia, where pop music and other Western forms such as rock have been effectively adapted into forms of social protest and criticism in countries such as Thailand and Indonesia. In Pol Pot?s Cambodia, pop music was seen as an evil and many musicians were murdered.
Some contend that Nanda Malini is a musical rebel because of her Pawana programme. The problem is that her protests remain entirely one-sided. Whatever her ideology is (she certainly isn?t liberal or leftist), her Pawana songs, coming at a time of JVP-led rebellion against the centre-right UNP regime of J. R. Jayawardene, were seen by many as a protest against the UNP?s capitalist, neoliberal and undemocratic excesses, and sections of the JVP thought that Pawana echoed their sentiments.?
All that is history now. But when ultra nationalist Mahinda Rajapaksa and his brothers imposed an even more brutal version of neoliberal, undemocratic capitalism on us, and began their bloody ?humanitarian mission? against the LTTE (the Tamils, too, are Sri Lankans, by the way) she remained silent. When asked by a Ravaya correspondent the reason for that, she responded by avoiding the question.
So much for Nanda Malini?s musical rebellion.
Of course there is now the phenomenon of Ajith Kumarasiri, the bilingual singer-song writer. This is not the place for a full discussion of his work and impact, and it?s too early to say if he?s a one-off phenomenon or the start of a new tradition of musical rebellion in this country, for he?s certainly a musical rebel.
The problem with Ajith is both his style and content. His guitar-strumming music is Blues-based. But, despite his obvious idealism, his songs are often crude, and he sounds hoarse. Striving for the upper register and sounding gruff is one thing ? sounding hoarse is another. One exception is ?Bill Gates and My Woody Gate?, a guitar ballad in English where he sings about his neighbour, a young girl (the video shows a man, presumably the singer, walking naked in the woods, filmed discreetly from the back). Sad and funny in turn, it?s a beautiful song and works because he keeps his voice within its most effective range and the music is better crafted than elsewhere in his work.
To shock is fine, but it takes craftsmanship to make things durable. Ajith has pushed the limits of the Sinhala song? ? the spoken word set to music, bold themes and provocative titles ? To the? Defense Secretary, Ammage Redda, Hey Geneva, Deshapalana Pakaya, Rabies in the Parliament, Uthura Sundarada, Thol Pethi Gawala Balamuda etc.?
He?s an in-your-face product of that once lively post-modernist debate, a battering ram against the established order and morality. Ajith, however provocative his titles might be, refrains from using the F-word. His lyrics are still tame compared to the average rapper from a US inner city ghetto, who can teach even the most profane post modernist guru how to use bad language (though some of our politicians can make even the vilest rappers blush).?
The problem with Ajith?s songs is not the language but the music. It just isn?t crafted well enough. Though he uses the blues musical idiom, to call his songs as such would give a misleading impression of the Blues because American Blues songs, be they about workmen?s woes or love?s troubles,? are very lyrical and tender. They are never profane (Elvis, deeply influences by the Blues, was never profane despite his pelvic thrusting).
But he?s the foremost musical rebel we have and let?s see where he stands ten years from now.
So far, we have been talking about the men, from Beethoven to Elvis, who rebelled in Western music. Women rebels are a more recent thing. What do they have to protest against? Certainly not about hunger and poverty, and they aren?t worried about the third world (there are no female Bonos). They gained equality long ago. But? now there is girl power and female empowerment (so what was women?s lib all about?).
This isn?t meant to be a complete history but we can generally say that Madonna was the first chart-climbing female pop star to win worldwide recognition and shake the walls. Before her, there are examples like ?Strange Fruit? by jazz singer Billie Halliday (based on a poem by Lewis Allan about the lynching of a black man) but obviously? less well known in many parts of the world.
With Madonna, we are on dangerous ground, because her rage and rebellion was focused on female sexuality, not hunger or political oppression. Her topics? can?t be discussed in this prudish Sri Lankan environment without serious blushes. Well, those who want may blush. While there is enough erotica covered in sentimental embroidery in the modern Sinhala song, there is nothing to match the gender-punching ferocity of Madonna and the legion of female singers who took her as her model, including Shakira of Latin America whose ?Hips Don?t Lie? is as provocative as it can get. Or it seemed for a while until even more daring female singers came along?
Back to Madonna. Her sarcastic fury could? come in the form of a yearning to be ?Like a Virgin,? her signature 1986 hit in which she talks about finding a lover so good that it makes her feel like a virgin. It?s a seismic shift from the genteel world evoked in Elvis Presley?s 1961 hit ?Falling in Love With You? (?Shall I stay, or would it be a sin??), a world apart from Madonna?s strident self-congratulatory tone or the even more brash narcissism displayed by Shakira in her 2006 hit ?Hips Don?t Lie?. But it?s Elvis with his unusual body dynamics? who began knocking down the great walls of Victorian moral rectitude and paved the way for the 1960s sexual revolution in the West, so that what Elvis did with his pelvis, Shakira could do with her hips.
Interestingly, Elvis was ridiculed by the press as copying raunchy Burlesque dancers when he began his act in 1956. ?His performance was the most disgusting exhibition this reporter has ever seen. For Presley is the male counterpart of a hoochee-koochee dancer in a burlesque show,? said the Sixoux City Journal in 1956.? Another writer described Elvis as a masculine version of Marilyn Monroe wriggling.
In other words, Elvis Presley wasn?t seen as a macho male hunk and the epitome of male aggression on stage. He assumed the body dynamics of female stage personae, narrowing the gender gap and putting women more at ease.
The debut of Madonna?s ?Like a Virgin? has to be remembered with her shocking stage attire ? she sang and danced on stage in white lace, the yin version of Elvis Presley?s shiny silver outfits and pelvic thrusting. The late 90s and early 00s saw a galaxy of pop stars (including Shakira, Christina Aguilera and Britney Spears with her ?Baby One More Time?) follow Madonna?s gate crash through the walls of conventional wisdom about what a girl should sing about and how to dress on stage.?
This was female sexual empowerment. This was a worldwide phenomenon, not just some Anglo-Saxon thing, and included singers such as Selena Gomez (previously known for her Disney songs). She wore a black lace corset and declared war on sexual convention with the lines ?when you?re ready, come and get it (na, na, na, na)?
As if all this wasn?t bad enough, the next logical step was to sing about bisexuality and lesbianism. Singer Kate Perry sang about how enjoyable it was to kiss a girl while hoping her boyfriend doesn?t mind it. But that still didn?t go as far as the Russian female duo Tatu bringing their tongues together in a music video.
And now there?s R & B and soul singer Janelle Monae with her Pynk (a parody of the title of an Aerosmith hit which extolled the virtues of female sexuality in a no-holds-barred manner) which has been hailed by American critics as a girl power anthem, while the lesbian community praised the accompanying music video for its erotic content.
Sensationalism, or something that will last? Only time will tell. To tell the genuine apart from what is wrapped up for the market takes time. What Elvis did lasted beyond him. Mississippi Burning has lasted, but there?s no titillation there, no room for lace outfits. Entertainers know that, given a choice of singing about Tiananmen square or what it felt like to lose it at the movies (to paraphrase Pauline Kael, a film critic and not a singer) what?s going to sell better.
One can always argue that flaunting one?s sexuality or thrusting out the pelvis isn?t necessary. But very few would say the same about flaunting one?s wealth, which happens all the time, everywhere in the world. What is noteworthy that, just as rock and roll is no longer limited to Memphis, USA, this open confrontation with conventional morality isn?t limited to the West.?
As if all this wasn?t bad enough, the next logical step was to sing about bisexuality and lesbianism. Singer Kate Perry sang about how enjoyable it was to kiss a girl while hoping her boyfriend doesn?t mind it.?
But when it comes to Sri Lanka, my main hypothesis is that, while we have a very long history of political rebellion, this isn?t reflected in our music. As for rebelling against conventional morality and sexuality, a relatively modern phenomenon, we have no tradition at all, and it won?t happen easily because sexuality is a taboo subject everyone wants to avoid.?
You could argue that we have musical rebels such as Sunil Shantha, Victor Ratnayake, Premasiri Khemadasa and Sarath Wickrema, and even exponents of the? baila tradition can be included in the list. But they were essentially experimenting with the musical idiom and expanding it within the same conventional parameters. Only Khemadasa, whose disgust as conventional politics matched that of Beethoven, and Sarath Wickrema who worked with Tamil singers and musicians, thus challenging the cultural purity of Sinhala music, stand out. We now have the beginnings of a Sinhala rock tradition, but it?s still too early to talk about its impact.?
The only certainty is no Lankan singer has so far challenged the political and moral status quo the way some Western pop singers have done. Along with the galaxy of pop stars mentioned above, thousands of singers and bands across the Western hemisphere? have used their music as sonic battering rams against the stifling great walls of convention, while we have been always been safely on this side of the fence.
It is highly unlikely that today,? any such voices of rebellion will be tolerated? by a mythology and convention-driven Lankan culture.? Ajith Kumarasiri can do it because he will hit back at critics as savagely, and remains marginal. Anyone less thick-skinned and striving for national stardom will be pulverized by the Face Book cultural mobs and soon become history.

France, (rt.com), 6 May, 2018 -France?s foreign ministry and some former top officials have condemned the US President for claiming that the Bataclan carnage and other 2015 terrorist attacks could have been avoided if the country had looser gun ownership laws.? ?
?France expresses its firm disapproval of the comments by President Trump? and asks for the memory of the victims to be respected,? said a statement from the foreign ministry, in relation to the series of coordinated attacks in which 130 victims were killed in suicide bombings and by gunfire by a group of Islamist terrorists. ?France is proud to be a country where acquiring and carrying firearms is strictly regulated,? the ministry emphasized.? ?
Calling Trump?s comments ?shameful? and ?obscene? on his Twitter, former President Francois Hollande noted that the US leader?s statements exposed ?what he thinks of France and its values.?? ?

Hawaii braces for long upheaval as erupting Kilauea boils
	
?
THE HINDU, 06th MAY, 2018- Hundreds of anxious residents on the Big Island of Hawaii hunkered down on Saturday for what could be weeks or months of upheaval as the dangers from an erupting Kilauea volcano continued to grow.
Lava spurted from volcanic vents, toxic gas filled the air and strong earthquakes, including a magnitude 6.9 temblor on Friday, rocked an already jittery population. The trifecta of natural threats forced the evacuation of more than 1,700 people from communities near the lava and prompted the closure of parks, college campuses and a section of the main road through the area on the Big Island?s southern tip.
Five structures have burned and thousands of customers briefly lost power from one of the larger quakes. Tina Neal, the scientist in charge of the U.S. Geological Survey?s Hawaiian Volcano Observatory, warned distressed residents at a community meeting late Friday that eruptions could last longer than the ones from earlier this week, and earthquakes and aftershocks could continue for days, even weeks.

How Mahanama appointed as President?s Chief of Staff: CHR
	
It is a question to be raised as to how I. H. K. Mahanama was appointed as the President?s Chief of Staff, when the investigation had been underway against him in relation to soliciting a bribe of Rs. 540 million from an Indian businessman, which was caught red handed recently, Centre for Human Rights (CHR) Executive Director Keerthi Tennakoon said.
Addressing a news briefing, he said I. H. K. Mahanama was unaware until he was caught red handed that the Indian businessman from whom he had been solicited the bribe, had lodged a complaint to the Commission Investigating Allegations of Bribery or Corruption (CIABOC) about the initial stage of asking the bribe and added accordingly the CIABOC had commenced the investigations.
?Although the said incident came into spotlight recently, there have been discussions with the President?s Chief of Staff Mahanama and State Timber Corporation (STC) Chairman P. Dissanayaka and the Indian businessman since May, 2017. Then and there, they have been threats to the businessman from the solicitors. In such a background, it is questionable as to how Mr. Mahanama was appointed to such a higher rank as President?s Chief of Staff,? Tennakoon said.
Meanwhile, he accused Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe on his statement made at the UNP May Day rally that the Samurdhi Development Bank would be soon brought under the control of the Central Bank (CB).
?If the Samurdhi Development Banks came under CB, it would be the end of the Samurdhi Banks and the deposited money of the poor would be wasted,? Tennakoon added.
However, he said the government might use the currency of the Samurdhi Banks to overcome the existing economic calamity. (Sheain Fernandopulle)

Late E. L. B. Hurulle  An honest politician respected by all
	
(Article written to remember the late minister on his 9th death anniversary in April)? ?
In the year 1977 E. L. B. Hurulle, the then MP for Horowpothana was appointed Minister of Cultural Affairs in the government of Prime Minister, J. R. Jayawardene.? ?
Although, the Cultural Affairs Ministry was perceived to be an inactive Ministry, Mr. Hurulle took it upon himself to create importance and value for the Ministry by embarking on several activities to bring attention to his ministry nationally.? ?
Thus a major project was initiated by his submitting Project proposal No.19 to the World Congress of the UNESCO in Paris proposing the conservation of Sri Lanka?s main cultural monuments.? ?
The proposal of Minister Hurulle was accepted by UNESCO including the creation and funding of 6 projects identified as the ?Cultural Triangle? encompassing a distance of 100 miles to cover the ancient cities of Anuradhapura, Polonnaruwa and Kandy.? ?
The six projects approved were the Jethavana Temple and Abhayagiri Monastry in Anuradhapura, the Sigiriya Water Park, Alahana Pirivena at Polonnaruwa, the Rock cave temple in Dambulla and the heritage sites in Kandy.? ?
The proposal of Minister Hurulle was accepted by UNESCO including the creation and funding of 6 projects identified as the ?Cultural Triangle? encompassing a distance of 100 miles to cover the ancient cities of Anuradhapura, Polonnaruwa and Kandy.??
As such, excavation work commenced at the above sites which were funded by UNESCO. Discoveries of cultural and historical value were made. In addition, underdeveloped Buddhist Temples located round Sri Lanka were benefited by way of development and the increased attention of both local and overseas devotees was seen.? ?
Minister Hurulle was born in January 1919 in the village of Morakewa, Horowpothana in the district of Anuradhapura as the second son of Tikiri Banda Hurulle Rate Mahatmaya and Alice Bulankulame. He had his education in Trinity College, Kandy and St.Patrick?s College, Jaffna after which he joined Government Service in 1938 as a Divisional Revenue Officer (DRO) in Moneragala District.Thereafter he served the people in Vavuniya North, Matale North and Kahatagasdigiliya in the Hurulle Palatha of the NCP.? ?
Being a person who had provided honest and dedicated service to the people as a DRO, the then Prime Minister, Sir John Kotelawala, invited Mr. Hurulle to be the candidate of the United National Party (UNP) for Horowpothana at the Parliamentary General Election of 1956.? ?
Although the UNP at this election was reduced to a mere eight seats in Parliament, Mr.Hurulle was able to win his seat in Parliament comfortably and in the two Parliamentary elections that followed in 1960 as well.? ?
Following the Parliamentary General election of 1965, E. L. B. Hurulle was appointed Minister of Transport in the Government of Dudley Senanayake and played a pivotal role in the development of transport in Sri Lanka.? ?
The importation of quality vehicles for the Taxi Service, Land vehicles for Plantation estates, Lorries for the transport of produce and materials throughout the country were a few economically beneficial activities initiated by him. In addition, it was during this period that Sri Lanka (then Ceylon) was able to purchase a Trident Passenger jet plane for Air Ceylon which allowed the airline to fly international air routes and put Sri Lanka on the international air map. The Railway Department too was supplied with modern Diesel engines and carriages to facilitate travel of the general public.? ?
With Mr. Hurulle?s appointment as Minister of Cultural Affairs in 1977, a whole new awakening of Sri Lanka?s cultures and religions were seen. Mr. Hurulle being a descendant of the lay retinue that accompanied Theri Sangamitta who carried the Sacred Bo Tree Plant from Dambadiva to Anuradhapura facilitated the bringing of the Sacred Kapilawastu Relics of Lord Buddha to Sri Lanka for the first time and made arrangements for these Sacred Relics to be taken to all parts of the country for exhibition and worship over a period of 60 days.? ?
Other service provided by ELB Hurulle included the conduct of a Tripitaka Dharma Sangayanawa at Mihintale, facilitating for Buddhist devotees to make pilgrimages to India and Nepal, ensuring the distribution of books on Buddhism to students attending Dhamma schools around the country, arranging for the Department of Examinations to conduct Dhamma examinations and Dharmachariya examinations.? ?
The Department of Buddhist Affairs of the Cultural Affairs Ministry played a principal role in these activities. It was during this period that significant amendments to the Temple and Devala Ordinance were made and action taken to increase the income of Temples and Devalas from their properties. On an international perspective, in 1980 Minister Hurulle attended the sessions of The World Fellowship of Buddhists in Thailand and proposed that a new organization be set up consisting of World Buddhist Leaders and Professionals which was approved unanimously. As a result, the first sessions of World Buddhist Leaders was held in Colombo, Sri Lanka in 1984.? ?
At the same time, Mr. Hurulle ensured that his Ministry assisted and facilitated activities of other religions to ensure their development while having an excellent rapport with their religious leaders. He treated and respected all people alike, irrespective of race, religion and caste.? ?
Being an honest politician from a respected family, ELB Hurulle led a contented life up to the age of ninety years having lived and worked for the people of our country sans allegations of dishonesty or fraud.? ?
I wish and pray that he attains the supreme bliss of Nirvana!? ?

Lessons from a  Sino-Indian Rapprochement
	
Global media attention was fixed on a rare and unprecedented meeting of the two leaders of North and South Korea, the images of the two leaders holding and shaking hands reached millions of viewers across legacy and social media platforms across the globe. It was heralded as a great moment of hope in a time of great uncertainty in global politics.? ?
Kim Jong-un?s announcement for negotiations with South Korea took the world?by surpise??
	Xi and Modi?s common challenge demonstrates that countries can work together and they as political leaders can make this work
This meeting eclipsed another meeting that took place between the Chinese President and Indian Premier on the very same day. The meetings of the two leaders were not in a formal setting, yet the fact that after a 73-day standoff in Doklam plateau between the forces of India and China and the tense nationalist narratives that almost put two most populous nations on war footing, and hence the meeting was significant in political terms.??
When Kim Jong-un announced a sudden pause to North Korea?s nuclear weapons programme and indicated that he is willing for immediate negotiations with his South Korean counterpart, analysts were scrambling to decipher the real motives and re-calibrate the new security environment that would emerge in the backdrop of a Korean peace process. The meeting between Xi and Modi brought out hope for a cooling Asia after months of hostilities and aggression in all domains of war fighting.??
Xi ? Modi meeting??
The diplomatic initiative for the Modi-Xi meeting was led by the Indian side, whilst the Chinese quickly responded and choreographed a scenic meeting between the two leaders in the China?s Wuhan province. Whilst the meeting was an informal meeting with no real agenda there were burning challenges for both sides that pragmatically needed the two countries to work together for any workable solution to be achieved.??
Especially both leaders are in the view that there is a significant level of uncertainty in global politics that is having an impact on the larger security environment. The actions of the US, Russia, BREXIT consequences in Europe and a burning Middle East in totality had the potential to impede prosperity of Asia.? ?
India and China are both encountering inconsistent overtures from an ambivalent Donald Trump. Indian administration was confident that the Trump administration would stick to the policies of previous administrations of Bush and Obama which saw a deepening and widening of US relationship and a clear set of policies adopted by the United States towards India.? ?
USA?s Foreign Policy??
United States foreign policy currently seems to be less strategic, driven by the impulses of the Presidency and seems contradictory especially with Jared Kushner?s engagement with China and Nikki Haley?s role as the US Ambassador to the United Nations. Trump?s brand of nationalism and his fatalism when it comes to Iran and Russia two countries India have strategic relations have complicated India?s foreign relations dynamics with the United States.? ?
India recently snubbed Australia when it rejected Australia?s participation in the Malabar naval exercises for 2018. Australia last week publicly admitted that it would not be part of the three nation?s naval drill which includes navies of the United States, Japan along with India to be held in June this year.? ?
There has been talks among security experts about the resuscitation of the Quad, which was a strategic assemblage in the Indian Ocean until 2008 when Australia under its former premier Rudd led an Australian withdrawal.??
Speaking at an event organized by the Bandaranaike Centre for International Studies (BCIS) in Colombo, earlier this year, India?s leading strategic analyst Nitin Gokhale said that India has not forgotten what Australia did a decade ago and hence is reluctant to readmit Australia back into the Quad.? ?
Geo political analysts argue that more than a rebuttal to Australia the Modi administration has rejected Australia to please China in this new moment of Sino India d?tente, which also saw the freezing of Indian relations with Tibet.? ?
India and China has many hurdles to cross if real, meaningful and stable rapprochement to be achieved. Prof. Swaran Singh a leading International Relations scholar from the Jawaharlal Nehru University observed India?s new and sophisticated foreign relations re-calibration as a representation of the emerging policy of ?Multi Alignment? a form of engagement which encourages partnering with many countries as possible without making one relationship hostage to another.??
President Xi and Prime Minister Modi?s common challenge will be to demonstrate that the countries can actually work together and they as political leaders can make this work. Political insiders are reporting of a plan for the two countries to work on a common economic project in Afghanistan. Ascertaining the mutual economic benefits in real terms may take a long time yet the political significance of a Sino Indian joint projects carries major symbolic values, especially if the site of preference is in Afghanistan.??
In strategic terms the very first joint venture between India and China to be located in Afghanistan will make Pakistan and the United States very concerned and will challenge Pakistan?s strategic orientation and push them to revisit their strategic relations with China.?
Asia Arming without Aiming??
While Asia seems to be heading towards political reconciliation in a grander scale, Asia is not immune to the increasing militarization of the region and the latest reports emerging from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) is that world military expenditure rose to $1,739 billion in 2017. Asia and Middle East seem to be leading in arms procurement and arms transfers. China and India are witnessing significant increases in defence spending.??
Increasing military spending does not help in providing regional or global stability or help any conflict prevention measures in the long run. While India and China maybe cooling tensions, both countries are pursuing large scale military modernization and upgrades of every available weapon platforms.? ?
Till recently the nuclear dimension did not take priority in the security discourse as China to a certain extent did not perceive India?s nuclear programme to be threatening. Consistent upgrades to the Indian ballistic missile programme has irked Beijing and they have been much vocal about India?s nuclear ambitions especially since the Agni 4 missile tests in 2016.??
Sri Lanka?s choices??
From a Sri Lankan stand point, it should be realized that what is best for our prosperity and strategic interests is to accept the 21st century realities in global politics. The best form of diplomacy is to engage with as many countries as possible irrespective of their political model. For too long we have dwelt upon a foreign policy orientation of a 20th century mentality, of non-alignment and the dream of using that as furthering our interests.??
Non-alignment carved out a significant place for us in the world in the 20th century, given the realities of the cold war, but the 21st century realities are at a different level of complexity, Cold war binaries have been replaced with foreign relations that are contingent on rapidly changing global dynamics.??
India while having ambitions of regional dominance has also ceded to the fact that it still is not in a position to sustain adversarial relation with China that will harm its economic prosperity and create more instability in the region.??
Sri Lanka could and should adopt a foreign policy of ?multi engagement? driven by the core principal that irrespective who we engage with to stay far from their rivalries and not use these rivalries for our short term benefits. While on theory this approach is pragmatic it will take intelligent and pragmatic diplomatic skills to accommodate such skillful statecraft.??
A major challenge for a small state like Sri Lanka to shape its foreign policy, sync it with its domestic and national interests is contingent on its reading of the complex transformations in the region and the world. President Xi and PM Modi jointly called for their armed forces to prudently manage their differences. Sri Lankan foreign policy shapers need to see the telling signs of how even regional powers are flexible enough to respond to complexities, by adopting agile and flexible policy imperatives.??

May Days  and Mayhem
	
A few days into the month of May, the country is further polarized and in disarray. The internationally recognized May Day itself was officially postponed in Sri Lanka from May 1 to May 7. And May 1 was marked by yet another cabinet reshuffle worsening the persisting confusion and lack of any initiative from a crippled Government. New corruption scandals keep erupting, leaving the people puzzled and disillusioned.? ?
Furthermore, the month of May also marks nine years since the end of the war, and there could be some ideological manoeuvring in the South and the North as the war anniversary is observed by some as a mark of victory and others as a reminder of devastation.? ?
Even though May Day should have ushered in solidarity for working people, in Sri Lanka the month of May seems to be a month of divisions.? ?
May 1
By all accounts, the May Day marches on May 1 had a defiant spirit as workers took leave from work and marched. It exposes the political chaff that are only concerned about patronage. Certainly, those who march on May 7 are beholden to political parties rather than workers? causes; and as with previous years, such May Day marches are merely the crass display of numerical strength of political parties. Arguably, there may be much wanting in the politics of the actors that organized the relatively smaller rallies on May 1, but it nevertheless provided for more genuine concerns of the rights of workers. Furthermore, the rallies of the independent trade unions in Colombo have become an energized annual affair with possibilities to form new and broader alliances.? ?
However, these independent trade unions also have a long way to go, in addressing concerns of women?s leadership and bilingual reach. Why is it that the speakers in such rallies are exclusively male and primarily monolingual with only Sinhala speeches? While ?man power? workers have found solidarity, some farmers and fisher-folk have joined the independent rallies and women?s demands were aired on May 1st this year, questions remain about the trade unions capacity for inclusion and solidarity. The trade unions face major challenges in shifting their politics towards the informal sector workers, rural working people, women?s rights and minorities concerns - both in terms of their own organizing work and their capacity to bring about social change through broader alliances.? ?
There is increasing lethargy in the Government and lack of political will to accelerate the economy and urgently address the day to day economic problems
Corruption and theatrics?
While the working people in the country have many economic grievances including rising cost of living and diminishing state services, the trade unions, including the independent unions have yet to put forward an alternate economic programme. Trade union demands have remained narrow and reactive to their own conditions and challenges such as ensuring wage increases. They have yet to put forward far reaching redistribution demands including policies to strengthen social welfare. Indeed, with national elections due in another year and a half, this would be the time to float such a progressive economic programme to initiate major debates on transforming the national economy.?
However, the public discourse is not conducive for such economic thinking. Corruption has become the main if not the only supposedly economic issue to be discussed in the media and even parliament. It is as though if corruption is eliminated the economic problems will be solved. Furthermore, economic policy changes have been reduced to changing the ministers and ministries. Without a broader shift in economic policies, including to reach those who are excluded and exploited, changing ministerial heads and subjects is akin to old wine in new bottles.? ?
There is increasing lethargy in the Government and lack of political will to accelerate the economy and urgently address the day to day economic problems. That too after the wake-up call of the local government elections. The nationalists in the South and the North, on the other hand, are predictably going to mobilize the theatrics of ?war heroes? and ?martyrs?, even as the public discourse next week shifts with the country marking the end of the war on May 18. Such nationalist mobilizations and posturing by the political mainstream will not only polarize the country but also detract from addressing the economic issues.? ?
Disruption and alternatives?
The Sirisena-Wickremesinghe Government, which was given a broad mandate to address the countries woes in January 2015, through its own commissions and omissions has brought about its own decline and lost a golden opportunity to address the national question. Even as the Government struggles to set its course for the remainder of its term, the Rajapaksa-led opposition?s strategy seems to be one of ungovernable disruption. That strategy has been working well over the last year for the Rajapaksa opposition as it makes electoral gains in tandem with the economic paralysis and political indecisiveness?
of the Government.? ?
The programme of the working people, unlike that of the narrow nationalists and politically ambitious opposition, cannot be merely one of disruption. Rather any progressive movement including the trade union movement has to build peoples power with an alternative economic and political vision. Would the independent trade union alliance that marched on May1be up?to that task?? ?

Minorities in the SAARC region
	
In December this year SAARC -South Asia Association for Regional Co-operation- which includes Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Pakistan, the Maldives, Sri Lanka and Nepal, will celebrate the 33rd year of its founding.? ?The region home to five main religions of the world -Buddhism, Christianity, Hinduism, Islam, and Judaism faces a multiplicity of ethnic/racial, religious, and gender-based problems.??
At the time of its formation, SAARC was derisively referred to by some, as an association of beggars. Today though, while the region is known for its riches in mineral resources and growing economic clout, a large section of its people continue to be among the most deprived in the world with around 451 million people living below the poverty line.? India and Pakistan, the two leading members of SAARC are nuclear powers. India is seen as one of the fastest growing economies in the world.??
The region is home to 23% of the global population and a single country in the association - Afghanistan - sits on one of the richest troves of minerals in the world with an estimated value of $ 1 trillion according to ?Live Science?.? SAARC countries have also been plagued by both inter-country and intra-country disputes as well as tensions based on race, caste and ethnicity.? India and Pakistan have as yet not come to terms over the carnage which followed partition at the time of their independence and have gone to war over Kashmir three times.??
Neither has time healed the scars of the massive human suffering which followed partition.? ?Today there exists a continuing hatred in India over the Muslim minority, leaving the community feeling vulnerable amid a large Hindu population, many of whom are very vocally extremist. Despite legal protections, Indian democracy has not been able to secure the rights of its many minorities. With low-caste Dalits (?untouchables?) suffering pervasive marginalization in public and private life, as do tribal people (Adavasi).? ?
Attacks on Muslims and Dalits in India are reported on a near daily basis. Statistics show that 86% of people killed in cow-related violence since 2010 are Muslims. The World Watch List 2017 ranks India 15th worst among nations where Christians are persecuted. Four years ago, India ranked 31st on the list.? ?
In Sri Lanka, the Tamil minority claims discrimination and has been demanding a greater role in government since independence. The community has suffered three major attacks based on race, including a state sponsored pogrom which led to a Tamil-led insurgency. Since the brutal crushing of that insurgency, the dominant political voice in Sri Lanka is that of a ?political Buddhism?. Muslims and Christians have become targets of nationalist forces which appear to have state protection.? ?
In Pakistan, the government has participated in attacks on Pashtun villages along its border with Afghanistan, alienating large sections of that community. In Bangladesh tensions between Bengali settler communities and indigenous Jumma settlements continue, again with apparent tacit government backing. In Nepal, the minority ?Madhesis?, with ties to India, accuse the Nepalese authorities of having failed to meet their aspirations for greater participation in government.??
Most countries in the grouping also accuse India of meddling in their internal affairs. Unfortunately none of the countries within the SAARC group has as yet been able to come up with a satisfactory solution to the issues of?
the minorities.??
Despite India being one of the fastest growing economies in the world, millions of Indians continue to live in darkness. Rape in India continues to grow alarmingly, and India has been described as the rape capital in the world. Sadly politicians within the Indian government itself have been implicit in backing rapists rather than their victims.??
Do the countries within SAARC have the will and ability to tackle the problems of minority interests in their respective countries? Or will communalism, racism and ethnicity continue to dictate the fate of millions within the group?? ?

People-smuggling: Australia warns against softening stance
	
The head of Australia's military-led border security operations has warned against any attempts to water the hardline policy down, following the interception of a people-smuggling boat off the coast of Malaysia.
Air Vice-Marshall Stephen Osborne, the commander of Operation Sovereign Borders, appeared alongside Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton on Monday to discuss the thwarted venture.
The modified tanker was carrying 131 Sri Lankans when it was halted off the coast of southern Johor state on Tuesday last week.
The boatload of 98 men, 24 women, four boys and five girls was believed to be bound for Australia or New Zealand.
Mr Dutton said the type of boat, its size and the people involved all pointed to a sophisticated operation, which had the potential to reach New Zealand.
Those responsible are well known, he told reporters in Canberra on Monday, while thanking Malaysian authorities.
Mr Dutton used the intercepted vessel to attack Labor's approach to border protection.
He pushed Labor to oppose a proposal for a 90-day limit on holding asylum seekers on Manus Island and Nauru, claiming Bill Shorten was "talking out both sides of his mouth" on offshore detention.
Air Vice-Marshall Osborne appeared to take an unusual step into the political realm when asked whether he shared the minister's concerns that "the boats will restart" under Labor.
"The most appropriate (thing) for me to say is Operation Sovereign Borders has been very successful now - it is almost four years without venture," he told reporters.
"It's built on a very particular structure and if we make any changes to that structure, I would have some concerns, and we will leave it at that."
Mr Dutton warned New Zealand was now being marketed as a "definite destination" by people smugglers.
He said New Zealand was the only country in the world where you can have a visa into Australia on arrival.
"The people smugglers understand that and I don't understand why Labor can't get it," Mr Dutton told reporters.
The minister said parties need to be careful about putting New Zealand in the policy mix because it becomes the "sugar" on the table.
He stopped short of claiming New Zealand ought to accept any blame for the intercepted vessel due to its own border policies, but said the Ardern government now understood "the gravity of this situation".
"What I would say is that anybody, when they're talking about these matters, needs to be careful and circumspect about what it is that they're saying," Mr Dutton said.
"Because it will be interpreted a particular way by people smugglers"
Labor immigration spokesman Shayne Neumann claimed Mr Dutton was playing into the hands of people smugglers and criminals by his comments on the opposition's border protection policies.
"Labor believes in strong borders, offshore processing, regional resettlement and turn-backs when safe to do so because we know it saves lives at seas," Mr Neumann said.
"Shame on Peter Dutton and the Liberals for undermining Labor's strong position on border protection and encouraging the people smugglers to restart their vile trade."
Mr Neumann said the government should be able to negotiate a resettlement deal with New Zealand akin to one struck with the United States. (SBS News)

Plans in place for any Trump decision on nuclear deal: Rouhani
	
?
REUTERS, 06th MAY, 2018- President Hassan Rouhani said on Sunday Iran had plans to respond to any move by U.S. President Donald Trump on the 2015 nuclear agreement and the United States would regret a decision to exit the accord.
Trump has said unless European allies rectify ?flaws? in Tehran?s nuclear agreement with world powers by May 12 he will refuse to extend U.S. sanctions relief for Iran.
?We have plans to resist any decision by Trump on the nuclear accord,? Rouhani said in a speech carried live by state television.
?Orders have been issued to our atomic energy organization ... and to the economic sector to confront America?s plots against our country,? Rouhani told a rally in northeast Iran.
?America is making a mistake if it leaves the nuclear accord,? Rouhani said.
Britain, France and Germany remain committed to the nuclear accord but, in an effort to keep Washington in it, want to open talks on Iran?s ballistic missile programme, its nuclear activities beyond 2025 - when key provisions of the deal expire - and its role in Middle East crises such as Syria and Yemen.
?We will not negotiate with anyone about our weapons and defences, and we will make and store as many weapons, facilities and missiles as we need,? Rouhani said, reiterating a rejection by Iranian leaders of talks on Iran?s missile programme which Tehran says is defensive.

Putin sworn in as Russian president for fourth term
	
Vladimir Putin has been sworn in for a fourth term as president of Russia, after winning the election in March.
He has been in power for 18 years, whether as president or prime minister, and opponents have likened his tenure to the reign of a tsar, or emperor.
Russian TV showed Mr Putin, 65, leaving his Kremlin office and walking to the ceremony, down long corridors.
Riot police confronted protesters against his rule in Moscow and other Russian cities on Saturday.
More than 1,000 arrests are said to have been made in 19 cities.
The biggest complaint among Russians surveyed by the Levada Centre, a major sociological research body, was that Mr Putin had failed to reduce the wealth gap (the top complaint for 45% of respondents).
Another big complaint (for 39%) was the failure to refund Russians who lost savings during market reforms.
Mr Putin's most praiseworthy achievement was restoring Russia's world status as a great power (47%), according to the poll. It was conducted last month among 1,600 Russians in 136 towns and cities.
Compared with a similar poll in 2015, there was a doubling of complaints that Mr Putin had failed to raise wages, pensions and benefits.
Nearly half of the reported 1,000 arrests on Saturday were in Moscow.
Mr Putin was re-elected president with more than 76% of the vote, his best ever election performance, but widespread irregularities were reported by some international observers. Allegations of ballot-rigging had dogged previous elections too.
The country's best-known opposition leader, Alexei Navalny, was barred from standing against Mr Putin, on grounds of a conviction for embezzlement which he denies and alleges was politically motivated.
Mr Navalny was arrested briefly as he tried to join Saturday's unauthorised protest rally in Moscow under the slogan "He's not our tsar".
Domestic opponents accuse Mr Putin of undermining democracy in Russia - a policy dubbed "managed democracy" - to keep genuine opposition parties out of parliament and ensure that he and his allies retain power indefinitely.(BBC)

Samurdhi should not be distributed as relief among UNPers, SLFPers: JHU
	
Jathika Hela Urumaya (JHU) General Secretary and Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka said today the Samurdhi programme should be used to help the poor to come out of poverty rather than a move to distribute relief to UNPers and SLFPers.
Speaking at the JHU May Day rally in Colombo, he said even though only six per cent in Sri Lanka was in extreme poverty, one third of the families receive Samurdhi allowance.
?We are a middle income country right now. One third of the families receive Samurdhi allowance whereas only 6% are at extreme poverty line. We need to initiate a programme to eradicate extreme poverty of these people. The Samurdhi movement should be used to rescue the poor from extreme poverty rather than a mover to distribute relief to UNPers and SLFPers,? he said.
Mr. Ranawaka said Colombo would be made a city without shanties by 2023 and added that 20,000 housing units would be handed over to the needy people in Colombo by 2020.
He said the country's governance should be brought under a scientific manner.
He said a scientific government should be brought into power in 2020, which would give priority to skills rather than family based politics. (Ajith Siriwardana)

Shelter for homeless and jobs for youth; Premadasa?s utmost legacy
	
Assassin Babu had free access to Sucharitha? ?Twenty five years ago, on May Day in 1993, President Ranasinghe Premadasa, who was 68, was marching in a procession at the UNP May Day rally along Armour Street-Grand Pass Junction around 12.45 pm. The assassin suicide bomber, 23 year-old Kulaveerasingam Veerakumar alias Babu, left his push bicycle near President?s vehicle and walked towards the slain President. Mohideen had prevented the security men from stopping Babu - his friend - by signaling the security men to allow Babu to go near him. Babu who befriended E. M. P. Mohideen, President?s trusted valet was in and out of Sucharitha, the president?s private residence for more than a year. Veerakumar exploded the bomb strapped to his body, killing along with himself, Mohideen, SSP Ronnie Gunasinghe, President Ranasinghe Premadasa and several other men in his security contingent. Pictures published after the blast illustrated bodies scattered on the road, along with pieces of clothing, debris of glass and the shoes of men who had escaped.??
Premadasa was famously known to be a hard working, self-disciplined man and was an effective administrator
The systems, which Premadasa had introduced, were not pursued by his successors who hadn?t his experience in governance. He believed in establishing structures and policies to guarantee continuity. Irrational amending of established policies, institutions and structures is detrimental to the country?s progress, a truth that President R. Premadasa firmly believed in.? ?
When he took over the reins in 1988, a foreign force, the IPKF was occupying one-third of the soil in Sri Lanka at the invitation of his predecessor, JR Jayewardene. He pledged during his campaign that he would send the IPKF back to India. The IPKF who had been here two years by then decided to leave resulting in our relations with India dropping to a new low. President Premadasa further stated that the decentralization of power was a political course and that the IPKF had no responsibility in it. He faced the conflict with bravery.? ?
Premadasa was famously known to be a hard working, self-disciplined man and was an effective administrator. However, one cannot deny the fact that his style necessitated certain carelessness around him. This facilitated him to sustain unusual contacts. His predecessors from both main parties operated from upper class uptown areas as Cinnamon Gardens, and Colombo 3 or President?s House in the Fort. Premadasa cramped himself to his working class pedestal in Pettah outskirts, a weakness on his part. This slackness enabled him to be very cautious about his associates and his ?business?, which were critical to him at important times..??
He faced opposition from within his own party after he was named the Presidential candidate, but he dealt with them successfully to survive
It would be recalled that the period within our country when occupied by IPKF was extremely sensitive one; the commanding officer of the IPKF, Gen. Kalkat once threatened that his forces would assault our army if they leave barracks, where they were confined as per the Rajiv Gandhi-Jayewardene Indo-Lanka Agreement of 1987. As tension increased, Ranjan Wijeratne, Foreign Minister rushed to India and had a chat with Narasimma Rao, his Indian counterpart and it was decided that the extraction of forces under a phased withdrawal would commence end of July to end in March 1990. Premadasa firmly and genuinely believed that he could build peace with Prabhakaran.? ?
Sri Sucharitha Movement? ?
Young Ranasinghe Premadasa founded the Sri Sucharitha Movement? he was a full-time organizer of the community project launched with the aim of economic, social and spiritual development of the poor people living in shanties of the capital in 1930 and 40s. Premadasa the teetotaler, enrolled youth in his development movement. They all refrained from consuming? liquor, smoking and gambling. Premadasa at the beginning of his political carrier supported the Labour Party, headed by veteran labour leader A. E. Gunasingha. In 1955, he was elected Deputy Mayor of CMC. In 1956, Premadasa joined the UNP and impressed leaders with his capacity to work and get things done. He contested LSSP leader in 1956 at the Ruwanwella electorate.? ?
He was elected second Executive President in 1988 election when JR stepped down. He successfully endured an impeachment attempt by some of his party rivals together with the opposition. When he took oaths as President, the country was in turmoil with a terrorist movement led by the JVP in the South and the IPKF fighting LTTE in the North and East. After overcoming the challenges he concentrated on economic development. Premadasa tried to reduce the gap between Sinhalese and Tamils. In trying to device a political settlement, he set up a select committee. He paid no attention to his cabinet, took most decisions by himself and kept ministers in the dark. Most of them were forced out or left of their own accord. Lalith Athulathmudali, the Oxford-educated lawyer and a senior UNPer who attempted to impeach Premadasa, was assassinated eight days prior to killing of President. Athulathmudali, 57, was shot in the chest by an LTTE gunman at an election rally at Kirulapona. DUNF, his new party accused Premadasa for the crime, leading to political turmoil.? ?
Like other important elite political leaders of Sri Lanka, R. Premadasa was not born in a high caste privileged family but belonged to an?ordinary one
Million Houses programme? ?
President Premadasa wanted to replace the Indo-Lanka Agreement with a new treaty of Peace and Friendship with India, but the Indians wanted to strengthen the Indo-Lanka Agreement for it provided the necessary safeguards that favored Indian interests and purposes. Premadasa was a keen supporter of SAARC. He believed in establishing close relations with all neighbours. Premadasa had the insight to create an order and a scheme for everything. Discipline was his top priority ? he introduced methods and practices that were significant. Today due to lack of discipline, we are experiencing an extremely dreadful situation today; breakdown of law and order is unprecedented; the economy is in disarray with inflation and the CoL skyrocketing.
President Premadasa believed that people should be encouraged to achieve whatever maybe the objective. He was above caste, creed, ethnicity or religious differences. He openly declared on several occasions that, ?Whatever the race, religion, caste that any individual belongs to, we must realize that he/she has an inheritance to a share of this nation. We must therefore resolve our problems through debate, consultation and compromise; Unity could only be obtained by treating citizens as equals not by crushing on the rights of any group of persons. This nation belongs to all who exist in it?.? ?
President Premadasa pledged during his campaign in 1988 that he would send the IPKF back to India
He faced opposition from within his own party after he was named the Presidential candidate, but he dealt with them successfully to survive. He encouraged garment-related small-scale industries in poor areas by giving factory owners loans and textile quotas for export to Europe and United States thereby providing jobs for young females in the villages. Like other important elite political leaders of Sri Lanka, R. Premadasa was not born in a high caste privileged family but belonged to an ordinary one. After making a mark in Colombo Municipal, he finally became an MP. He remained so representing Colombo Central for many years. During his career, he introduced an assortment of welfare schemes for the poorest of the poorer sections of the population. He was instrumental in construction of affordable homes for the poor and that remains one his utmost legacies.??

There are politicians who are dreaming of coming to power by hook or by crook. By murders, frauds, embezzlement and other financial crimes? The country and people don?t want these murderers, fraudsters, thieves and criminals as their leaders in whatever masquerades they come before the people. The people want leaders who love the country and the people. There are so many who are dreaming of forming governments in 2020. They are in a fantasy world because they have no plan, strategy or vision to develop the country and strengthen inter-communal harmony and reconciliation. The SLFP has a clear-cut plan, strategy and vision on how to achieve economic progress and reconciliation by 2025. The SLFP is ready to launch this journey with like-minded people, political parties and trade unions who are concerned for the welfare of the country and reconciliation, President Sirisena said and added he would invite all academics, professionals and all other patriots to join hands with him in this noble mission of making Sri Lanka a prosperous and peaceful country.
President Sirisena said politicians tell fairy tales more often than not to hoodwink the people to fulfil their political agenda. They must have a solution to solve problems faced by Buddhists, Hindus, Muslims and Christians. Clean and honourable politics means finding solutions of all communities living in Sri Lanka. The SLFP has this quality and politicians who are capable of allaying the fears and sorrows of the people, he added.
President Sirisena pointed out that the post-war Sri Lanka has failed to exploit the benefits of peace even after 10 years since the obliteration of the LTTE. The post-war peace has been used only to promote inter-communal mistrust, suspicion and racial disunity for political gains. There are politicians who believe that they could survive only by promoting and spreading racial disunity and communal misunderstanding forever. But the policy of the government and the SLFP is that the country can be developed and prosperity of the people can be achieved only through peace and listening and getting advice from religious leaders of Buddhism, Hinduism, Islam and Christianity.
Politicians must realize that conflict resolution and provide relief to people cannot be done through war or the gun. It can be done only through dialogue, mutual respect and human love. The politician must always be honest, open-minded and without hidden agendas. The crooked politicians say many things and give many promises to people to come to power. They show a dreamland with divine pleasure and joy to the people. But they never say that those fantasy tales would never solve people?s problems.
President Sirisena pointed out that those politicians and political parties who are talking of 2020 elections have failed to put before the people their plan for the development of the country and reconciliation, unity and inter-communal harmony and added that it was only the SLFP that has come forward with a strategy and plan to develop Sri Lanka while promoting racial harmony.
They never say peace, harmony and economic prosperity cannot be achieved through these fairy tales. But sadly people get deceived by them. When they realize their mistake, they are too late, he said.
After the 30-year separatist war ended nothing significant has happened for the benefit of the people. Many ask as to what the unity government has done in the last three and half years. I would like to tell them that the unity government has transformed Sri Lanka into a civilized, decent and respected country in which all communities could live in peace and harmony. Sri Lanka is not branded as a ?Pariah State? anymore. This government has restored the rule of law, democracy firmly and ensured the independence of judiciary and press. The press-print and electronic-use their new found freedom to mercilessly attack the government in many instances with misinformation, fabrication absolute lies.
President Sirisena concluded by saying that the SLFP was ready to unite all progressive and patriotic politicians, political parties and trade unions under oner umbrella with a clear vision to bring sustainable peace and economic envelopment to the country beyond 2020 and made an appeal to all of them to gather under the SLFP flag to realize all of their expectations, hopes and wishes.
Ministers, Duminda Dissanayaka, Mahinda Amaraweera, Nimal Siripala De Silva, A.L.M. Athaulla, Deputy Ministers Sriyani Wijewickrama, Ali Sahir Maoulana, and A.L.A.M. Hjisbullah also addressed the gathering.
Parliamentarians, S.B. Dissanayake and Sumedha Jayasena, members of the rebel group comprising 6 SLFP cabinet Ministers, State and Deputy Ministers were present at the meeting occupying seats on the main stage. However, Thilanga Sumathipala and Dayasiri Jayasekara who attended the meeting were not seen on the stage. (Sandun A Jayasekera reporting from Chenkalady, Batticaloa)
