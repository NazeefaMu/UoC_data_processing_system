51 elephants, 19 people died in Polonnaruwa this year
	
A total of 51 wild elephants and 19 people had died in the Polonnaruwa District due to the human-elephant conflict to date this year alone, Wildlife Conservation Department officers of the Polonnaruwa District said.
A senior Wildlife Conservator said the death toll of wild elephants had been increasing in alarming proportions due to human activities and that elephants were often shot dead or killed by traps, while others were knocked down by trains.
He said the elephants going in search of fodder or water had also been found bogged down in marshes or drowned in rivers and canals.
He said the villagers had also resorted to the merciless act of laying the locally made explosive device called Hakka Patas (Explosive-laden fruits which explode as the animal eat them).
The explosive goes off causing serious injuries to the animal?s mouth which results in the death of the animal after a long and immense suffering for days of thirst and starvation added to the pain of injuries.
He said that clearing of forests for development and haphazard expansion of human settlements were the major causes of the human-elephant conflict and that the environment and the wildlife were casualties of such development.(. K.G. Karunartne)

## Title: England told to be on alert for match-fixers on their trip to SL

England told to be on alert for match-fixers on their trip to SL
	
England were warned on Saturday to watch out for approaches by match-fixers as cricket's governing body stepped up their investigation into 'serious' allegations of corruption in Sri Lanka.
The total wash-out of England's second and final warm-up game ahead of Wednesday's first one-day international shifted the focus on to the presence of the International Cricket Council's anti-corruption unit in Colombo, the Daily Mail reported.
Alex Marshall, general manager of the unit, is to continue his investigation into what are understood to be historical allegations of wrongdoing within the Sri Lankan game. He met the England team on Saturday.
He told them to be extra-vigilant during the five-match 50-over series and the Twenty20 international and three Tests that follow on this two-month long tour as cricket continues its seemingly endless battle against dark forces.
But Marshall did emphasise that his inquiries do not concern a one-day series that will begin, the Sri Lankan climate permitting, in the rain forest area of Dambulla at the start of this country's monsoon season.
'We have provided a detailed briefing to the Sri Lankan president, prime minister and sports minister,' said Marshall in an ICC statement.
'I'd like to make it clear these investigations have been on-going for some time and do not relate to the series about to start in Sri Lanka.
'However, I will take the opportunity to brief both teams in the coming days to ensure they remain alert to the risks from would-be corruptors.'
That briefing began with England at their Colombo hotel on Saturday while Marshall is expected to talk to the Sri Lankans when they gather in Dambulla. Match referee Richie Richardson will also be keeping a particularly close eye on a five-match series England will begin as firm favourites.
But that status was not helped on Saturday by heavy rain which left the P Sara Oval resembling a lake and restricted England's unsatisfactory preparations to the single bad-light affected warm-up victory against a Sri Lankan XI on Friday.
This tour has been crammed into England's increasingly overcrowded schedules by cricket's greedy administrators, in their wisdom, at a time of year when the elements are bound to be a factor in Sri Lanka.
'We know the rain will be around at certain points on this tour and that's something we just have to get on with,' said England's Chris Woakes. 'There will be games affected but you have to be mentally switched on.'
At least Woakes was able to bowl six overs in the heat and humidity of Colombo in Friday's win which will at least give him a taste of what to expect when the No 1 ranked team in the world take on a home side that have been so dismal in one-day cricket they have crashed to No 8.
Even spinners found the conditions difficult to handle, with Moeen Ali feeling so exhausted after bowling 10 overs on the bounce that he retired to the dressing room for a nap at the conclusion of Sri Lanka's innings.
Others have not been so lucky and England must now decide whether to stick with rookie Olly Stone in the first one-day international on Wednesday or replace him with a seamer in Sam or Tom Curran, or a third spinner in Liam Dawson.
'A few of the boys did find it difficult in the first game but we haven't been here a week yet and the longer we're here the more we'll adapt and find it easier,' said Woakes.
'As a seamer, you perhaps won't bowl so much here and sometimes have to bowl tough overs when you're containing to build pressure for the spinner at the other end.
'You're still picked as an opening bowler to take wickets but your mind-set does have to be different because sometimes it can be the best time to bat.'

Land Reclamation quits receiving Colombo waste from tomorrow
	
Sri Lanka Land Reclamation & Development Corporation (SLLRDC) temporary quits undertaking garbage collected in the Colombo Municipal Council (CMC) area from tomorrow as the CMC failed to make an outstanding payment of Rs.207 million to them for garbage management process.
Responding to a statement made by Colombo Mayor Rosy Senanayake that SLLRDC is taking extortion for garbage management, SLLRDC Chairman Roshan Gunawardena said that the service provide by SLLRDC is not a public charity.
According to Mr. Gunawardena, CMC has agreed to pay Rs. 3,000 for a metric tonne of segregated garbage and has a total outstanding of Rs.207 million for 15 months starting from May, 2017.
After the Meethotamulla Garbage Dump collapsed in April 14 losing 32 lives, the SLLRDC undertook the task to find a long standing solution to garbage management under the instructions given by President Maithripala Sirisena to Megapolis Minister Champika Ranawaka.
SLLRDC recycled and made compost from the garbage collected and handover by the CMC at Kerawalapitiya dumping yard.
?SLLRDC is not a dansala to give its service free of charge. Garbage management cost lot of money as we have to pay for officers and the machines used for the task. CMC is an institution that receives around Rs. 2 billion income per annum. Both the parties agreed to the said amount and we never over charged them,? he added.
Mr. Gunawardena said that they had reminded of the outstanding amount several times but the CMC authorities had not responded.
In a letter sent by the SLLRDC on October 1st it had made the final warning however following that Megapolis Ministry on October 4 had also instructed the CMC to make the payment.
Colombo Mayor Rosy Senanayake in a press briefing held recently, said that SLLRDC had violated the agreement and increased the charge for one metric tonne of garbage and the SLLRDC is using machines belonging to CMC in garbage management.
However, Mr. Gunawardena assured that SLLRDC never increased the charges and the resources that they used are owned by SLLRDC.
He further said that CMC authorities can reverse the SLLRDC decision if they agree to pay 50 percent of the outstanding amount.
?During the crisis situation we interfered garbage issue and controlled the situation. It is neither what SLLRDC does usually nor our responsibility. We provided CMC a service. They have to pay it as agreed. Why can?t CMC manage their own waste,? he added.
He further said that SLLRDC regrets of the statement made by the Mayor and said the entire statement made by the Mayor is baseless.
Colombo was severely hit with health issues including dengue epidemic situation due to piling Garbage Mountains after the Meethotamulla garbage dump collapsed.
Upon the request of the President, Megapolis Minister Champika Ranawaka and the SLLRDC officials were able to control the situation after an joint effort with the security services.
In a middle of an adverse weather situation, the SLLRDC?s decision to not to accept Colombo Garbage fears of reawakening the dengue and other severe health issues if the CMC fails to address the issue in a positive manner.
SLLRDC currently undertaking garbage belong to 15 Provincial Council?s and learned having a very flexible decisions with the provincial councils that do not have sufficient money to pay their waste. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)
