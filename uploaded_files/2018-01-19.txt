Ban on import of vehicles without safety standards from July 1
	
The government?s decision to ban the import of vehicles which are not equipped with air bags and seat belts and below the emission levels or its equivalent as prescribed by Euro IV, has been postponed to July 1, the Finance Ministry said today.
It was to have come into effect from January 1 as mentioned in the 2017 Budget.
?This decision has been taken after considering a request made by motor vehicle importers and manufacturers for more time to make the required adjustments and comply with the proposed emission standards and safety measures,? the ministry said in a statement.
It said the import of vehicles, which did not carry airbags and seat belts for the driver and the front passenger, Anti-Locking Breaking System (ABS) standards and three-point seat belts at the rear would not be allowed from July 1.
?As this rescheduling of the implementation is made based on the industry representations, the dealers, importers and manufacturers are strictly advised to refrain from establishing any Letter of Credit (LC) for the import of motors vehicles, which do not comply with the specified standards with an estimated arrival date after July 1, 2018.
Further details on the implementation of the new standards for vehicles, including the types of vehicles will be notified by the respective implementation agencies shortly,? the statement said. (Chaturanga Samarawickrama)

## Title: Body aches and Fibromyalgia
## Section: Medicine

Body aches and Fibromyalgia
	
I come across numerous patients who have had body aches for years. They have made many visits to the doctor to find out what causes tiredness, lack of sleep, headaches, depression, forgetfulness and painful muscles and joints. Arthritis has been ruled out in many among them, but what actually is the reason for all these symptoms? Fibromyalgia might explain all of the above.??
Fibromyalgia is a condition that mainly affects the muscles and sometime the joints. It?s a collection of various symptoms and is a diagnosis made after ruling out more obvious reasons for joint pain like arthritis. Fibromyalgia might lead to significant problems at one?s work place and is common among ladies.? ?
In the following article I will explain some of the features of fibromyalgia, ways to diagnose this condition and some common mimics and methods of treatment. It?s a common disorder affecting almost one in every twenty-five adults.? ?
?
The beginning?
The exact trigger for fibromyalgia is unknown. We think that it?s a combination of neurological, psychological and sometimes external factors that initiate the symptoms. Pain is a defensive response to any form of injury. It makes any living form withdraw from the stimuli. When we feel pain we try to get away from the harmful source and this itself protects our body from further damage. In fibromyalgia, there is no visible cause for the pain. The patients simply feel pain without any reason. Some research shows that patients who have fibromyalgia are more sensitive to pain compared to others. When the body repairs the damaged organ/part in a healthy person, pain tends to diminish or disappear. But in fibromyalgia, as there is no exact cause for pain, it tends to last longer.??
Sleep disturbance is also associated with this condition and we believe that the patients never experience deep sleep. This could be because of the continuous pain. Not feeling refreshed upon awakening is a result of this haphazard sleep pattern.? ?
Depression is associated with pain in any healthy person. As the pain tends to last longer, patients with fibromyalgia are more depressed. This could in turn affect sleep and vice versa. Normal pressure over healthy muscles/joints/parts of the body can cause severe pain and this was earlier used as a test to diagnose the condition. Unlike in arthritis when we examine the joints we do not find features of wear and tear or inflammation (red, hot, swollen joints).??
Most patients with fibromyalgia feel very tired. As this is again a long standing complaint we call it chronic(long standing) fatigue (undue tiredness). Healthy people get tired after physically demanding tasks, but fibromyalgia patients feel tired even after periods of rest. There is a different condition called chronic fatigue syndrome which usually happens after a viral infection. This should not be confused with fibromyalgia.??
A condition where the bowel habits become irregular with constipation and diarrhoea is called irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). IBS can be associated with fibromyalgia.??
?
Common conditions?
Certain diseases need to be ruled out before diagnosing fibromyalgia. For an example lack of blood particles (haemoglobin) can cause a condition called anaemia. Anaemia leads to breathlessness, tiredness, difficulty in concentrating etc. Treatment for anaemia is with iron or nutrients. Lack of thyroid hormones can cause lethargy, slowness, hoarse voice, weight gain, muscle aches, joint pain and constipation. This ?Hypothyroidism? requires hormone supplements.??
Arthritis is the commonest cause for joint pain. Some patients who have arthritis have muscle involvement with swelling. This could cause severe muscle pain and tenderness (pain when being pressed upon). Treatment for arthritis differs from the medication given for fibromyalgia.??
?
Outlook
Before explaining the methods of treatment I would like to say a few words about the long-term outlook of fibromyalgia. The strange conclusion is that fibromyalgia doesn?t actually cause any damage to either bones, muscles or joints. Having said that, it does cause severe mental agony. This is because it is a long lasting condition.??
Fibromyalgia affects different patients in different ways. In some it is just a body ache which one could cope up with, but in others it leads to failure in life events and work. So as specialists we need to identify how severely this affects the individual patient, hence the need to individualise treatment.??
?
Diagnosis??
Earlier we used to diagnose fibromyalgia using eighteen different areas of the patient?s body. When pressure is applied over those areas it leads to a diagnosis of fibromyalgia. Now the method of diagnosis is different.? ?
Patients with fibromyalgia should have widespread pain lasting three months or more, fatigue, waking up not feeling refreshed and problems with the thought processes like memory and understanding (cognitive symptoms).? ?
The widespread pain is checked over nineteen areas of the body. And then a score is given between zero to nineteen. Fatigue, not wake refreshed and cognitive symptoms are again given a score between zero to four. This is based on how bad things are. Somatic symptoms are considered next and given a score between zero to four. Some examples for somatic symptoms are headache, pain/cramps in the abdomen, numbness/tingling, dizziness, insomnia, depression and constipation.? After the scores are obtained we figure out whether the patient has fibromyalgia or not. But the most important task is to exclude serious underlying illnesses. There is no blood test or scan to diagnose fibromyalgia, so it is a challenge diagnosis to make sometimes.??
?
Treatment?
I prefer to simply divide the treatment strategies to ones involving medication and therapies that don?t introduce medication. It is strongly advised to combine both methods to provide the best benefits to the patient.??
There are various drugs used for fibromyalgia out of which antidepressants take centre stage. Usually antidepressants are given to treat low mood, but in fibromyalgia these are proven to help reduce the pain. Sometimes patients need to take these for a longer duration for the best results to be achieved. Some common examples of antidepressants used are amitriptyline and duloxetine.??
Another category of drugs used are gabapentin and pregablin. These are also called neuropathic drugs and change the way we perceive pain. We start these with a very low dosage and gradually observe how the symptoms subside. A common sideeffect of these drugs is drowsiness. But as most fibromyalgia patients suffer from insomnia, this side effect is sometimes considered as an advantage.??
Tablets which have a mixture of paracetamol and codeine are sometimes useful, but usually the normal pain killers and ointments are ineffective in treating fibromyalgia.??
If we consider alternative therapy, I find exercise one of the best remedies for fibromyalgia. Exercise doesn?t mean that patients have to run one or two kilometres a day. Brisk walking for about twenty minutes a day or climbing a staircase rapidly are also good forms of exercise that might be very soothing to the body. There are also stretching exercises that could be done without mobilising yourself too much.??
Sometimes referral to physiotherapy and occupational therapy is beneficial in fibromyalgia. In the United Kingdom we used to refer patients to a pain clinic attended by physiotherapists and psychologists. One might wonder what a psychologist has to offer in fibromyalgia. I would say the psychologist can do a lot, considering all the emotional aspects of pain and its consequences. Relaxation techniques are also proven to be useful when treating fibromyalgia.? ?
In Sri Lanka some patients have found Yoga as a useful remedy for pain relief. The same principals apply in a martial arts form named Tai Chi. In China I have witnessed this common sight before office hours or even at parks, where groups of individuals practice Tai Chi to bring down the stress levels. Both Yoga and Tai Chi involve gradual movement of limbs in a methodical manner.? ?
I always advice patients with fibromyalgia to practice good sleep hygiene techniques. Sleep hygiene is not just maintaining cleanliness, but various other factors such as food, beverages, natural light, ventilation etc. which have a collective effect in improving sleep.??

Bond report: JVP says AG cannot be trusted
	
While claiming that the Attorney General cannot be trusted on implementing the recommendations of the Bond Commission, the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) said today legal action should be taken against those involved in the Central Bank bond scam through a special court established by Parliament.
JVP MP Sunil Hadunnetti told a news conference that it has been more than a year since thereport of the Committee On Public Enterprises (COPE) on the Bond scam had been sent to the Attorney General and added that he had taken no action so far.
?It is pointless to expect any action from the AG against those held responsible by the Bond Commission. The COPE report on the Bond scam was sent to him on October 17, 2016. He has not given his recommendations or action to be taken even after 15 months. So how can we expect any action from him,? he asked and added that legal action should be initiated through a special court established through Parliament. (Ajith Siriwardana)

REUTERS, 18th JANUARY, 2018
A bus fire in northwestern Kazakhstan killed 52 Uzbek citizens on a route used by migrant workers heading to Russia, the Kazakh Interior Ministry said on Thursday.
The bus was travelling along a road in the remote Aktobe region that links the Russian city of Samara to Shymkent, a city in southern Kazakhstan close to the Uzbek border.
It was unclear in which direction the bus, a Hungarian-made Ikarus, had been travelling, but the route is widely used to transport Uzbek workers to and from Russia where they often take work on building sites.
Only five people managed to escape the burning vehicle, the interior ministry?s emergencies department said in a statement.
The ministry said the apparent accident had happened at 10.30 a.m. (0430 GMT), but provided no details about its cause.
A photograph posted online from the site showed the bus completely burnt out. Video footage also posted on the Web showed it positioned diagonally across a two-lane freeway in the middle of a snow-covered steppe, in flames and emitting heavy black smoke.

Cargills Bank pioneers use of cognitive security in Sri Lanka
	
IBM announced Cargills Bank Ltd, a licensed commercial bank based in Sri Lanka, has deployed IBM?s cognitive cyber security solutions to enhance its existing defensive capabilities, enable improved monitoring and implement stronger preventive protocols to guard against sophisticated threat incidents.
With the financial services industry being targeted the most by cyber criminals, Cargills Bank has taken a proactive approach to better safeguard customers and becomes the first commercial bank in Sri Lanka to deploy AI technology to augment its operations and security capability.
With the significant increase in the number of cyberattacks, the volume and rate of security information (both structured and unstructured) has continued to grow at a rate and speed which makes its near impossible for security teams to stay up to date and armed with accurate intelligence to make decisions quickly. By introducing AI technology like Watson for Cyber Security, the process of quickly and accurately identifying critical threats becomes automated and enables security analysts to respond at a speed and scale not imagined before.?
Cargills Bank is leveraging IBM QRadar, an industry leading security intelligence platform, along with QRadar Advisor with Watson, the first security solution which takes advantage of IBM Watson?s unique augmented intelligence capabilities, to facilitate early detection and classification of cyber threats and alerts.?
The solution helps Cargills Bank?s cyber defence team to manage and analyse the large volumes of unstructured information coming from multiple external streams and compare it with the latest information about potential threats coming from within their systems to get a complete picture of the threat and thereby correlate the data to obtain actionable insights. This was implemented locally through IBM Business Partners Blue Chip Engineering Co. of Sri Lanka and Secbounty Services Private Limited of India.
Cargills Bank Chief Operating Officer Rohan Muttiah said, ?We are committed to enhancing our customers? digital banking experience while being mindful of emerging security threats. With cybercrime becoming more organised and sophisticated, it is imperative to deploy highly adaptive prevention and response capabilities based on proven technology. IBM?s best-in-class cognitive security portfolio will help us pre-empt threats and mitigate risk, thereby supporting our position as a leading digital bank.??
?Cybercrime is the organised crime of the 21st century and possibly the single largest threat to any company in the world today. The increasing frequency of cyber attacks also brings up an overwhelming volume of related data, which is near impossible to comprehend quickly.?
Watson for Cyber Security has been trained in the language of cyber security and has ?read? two million cybersecurity documents which means it can help security analysts parse thousands of natural (human) language research reports that have never before been accessible to modern security tools,? said IBM Software Sales Sri Lanka and Maldives Head Manori Unambuwe.
?We are proud to associate with Cargills Bank on the first adoption of cognitive security capabilities in Sri Lanka, which will give them a distinct advantage in the industry,? she added.

Controversial hoarding: OSMO Fitness clarifies
	
In response to the incident regarding the controversial hoarding, OSMO Fitness in its official Facebook page said it was the first line in a scheduled awareness campaign, which promoted an ?Obesity-Free Sri Lanka?.
It said the promotion which will be launch next week was driven by some disturbing figures in a recent World Health Organization report that states an alarming percentage of women in Sri Lanka are more prone to diabetes, overweight, obesity and physical inactivity when compared to males.
?We like to reiterate that we do not have any intention whatsoever to degrade, offend, insult or undermine any person or women in general and that our moral obligation is towards improving the overall health of all Sri Lankans which we take very seriously.
?We would also like to remind everyone that OSMO is a fitness center that caters to many female members, along with several qualified female instructors who strive to help women achieve a healthy, fit and disease-free lifestyle. Women have always been an integral part of OSMO and will continue to do so well into the future.
?We respect the different viewpoints of the general public and regret any offence that was generated in response to the subject advertisement. Hence, we have decided to withdraw all communications relating to the advertisement in question.
?We would also like to voice our appreciation for each and every comment made in this regard, both on social media and various other levels, and are thankful to everyone who voiced their concerns and let us know their thoughts and insights on this sensitive topic,? it said.
Further, OSMO in its statement said it had received an unprecedented amount of response within a very short period that raised some concerns about the intentions of the aforementioned communication following the advertisement in question.
Meanwhile it said in response to the incident, along with its ongoing initiatives to improve women?s health in Sri Lanka, it has decided to offer any lady who walks in to OSMO on or before 26th January, a free Physical Fitness Assessment and a free two-week membership with the personalized attention of its qualified fitness instructors.

'Disease pattern of dengue unchanged but unusual variations can occur'
	
Dismissing reports indicating that the disease pattern or the dengue virus had significantly changed as baseless, Negombo's Clinical Head of the Centre for Clinical Management of Dengue Dr. LakKumar Fernando said there could be some unusual variations of the dengue virus.
He told the Daily Mirror that all diseases and biological events had a classical pattern that affected the majority while some unusual manifestations could occur to a small minority.
?Clinicians should identify these and treat them accordingly to the best of their ability. Treatment can also turn the disease bringing unusual results and with proper treatment most patients can be saved,? Dr. LakKumar said.
Sources had claimed that a new dengue strain had been detected and the behaviour of Dengue Haemorrhagic Fever (DHF) had changed drastically during the dengue epidemic.
According to reports several children with abnormal disease patterns were found and consequently it has become a real challenge to detect and manage the disease.
?It is important for the public to improve their own behaviour to protect themselves from mosquito bites and also doctors to improve their clinical management practices than blame the virus for unusual behaviour," Dr. LakKumar said.
Normally the Platelet count decreases on the third day of a dengue patient, but there are also occasions where Platelet count decreases on the second day.
Normally the leaking of fluid occurs between the 3rd and 4th days, but it can also occur before or after the relevant period.
?Settling of fever alone can deteriorate the nature of dengue. It means that some patients presume that when the fever gets cured, the whole dengue situation has come to an end. Perhaps it is not. The patients have to be more vigilant and go for frequent treatments until it is recommended by a qualified physician,? Dr. Lakkumar said. (Sheain Fernandopulle)

Drawing the line between fear and phobia
	
?
Fear, is a very common feeling everyone of us experiences at some point in our lives. it is defined as an emotional response to a real or perceived threat. It is not abnormal to feel little anxious when doing certain activities in our day-to-day lives, like walking on a bridge, looking down a hill or sitting next to a chair with a spider on its arm. For most of the people, these episodes of fearful sensations are temporary and easily handled. And more importantly they do not need medical help for sure.??
Phobia is a form of anxiety disorder which refers to excessive and persistent fear of objects and situations which do not carry real threats. Phobia is associated with a strong character of anxiety which is intense enough to interfere ones day-to-day activities and the quality of life. Unfortunately, they are permanent and very difficult to be handled until being treated.? ?
The etiology of phobias is known to be linked with genes, gender, brain chemicals, bad childhood memories and traumatic events in the past or particularly during childhood.??
Phobias are categorized into 3 main entities namely, specific phobia, social phobia and agoraphobia. Specific phobia refers to the fright one develops related to a specific object or situation like dogs, spiders, snakes, elevators, heights etc. Few of the well-known specific phobias are named as, Acrophobia, the fear of heights, Aviophobia, the fear of flying and Arachnophobia- the fear of spiders. Some phobias are very common while some are rarely heard of, but whatever it is, the affected person spends a life filled with fear and anxiety.??
Social phobia, which comes under anxiety disorders mainly includes, people who are reluctant to interact with the society. They would not avoid crowds, but try their best to stay away from conversations and interactive behaviours with others.??
Agoraphobia, which refers to people who fear leaving their familiar territory, find it very uncomfortable to remain with an unfamiliar crowd, since it is a nightmare for them to think of becoming helpless in case of a panic attack or medical emergency. They rather prefer, staying at home either with a trusted companion or alone.??
?
Difference
Most people might fear being in situations which they are not familiar with. But people with the above mentioned phobias will spend most of their time and energies on worrying about the situations and objects they fear. For an example, many people may fear snakes, but only the minority of them will meet the necessary requirements for it to be called a phobia. For an example, individuals, who are suffering from snake phobia, will spend most of their time worrying about snakes and try their best to avoid situations and activities in which they might come in to contact with serpents.??
For example they will never ever visit the snake section in the zoo. This will result in the reduction of one?s individual performance, efficiency and quality of life. Also, in cases where these people come across the object of fear, they become highly distressed and panic. Tachycardia, shortness of breath, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or even panic attacks are some of the negative impacts, documented.? ?
However, it is highly important to differentiate fear and phobia from one another, since they comprise various qualitatively different issues. In fact fears are nothing much to worry about, but phobias should be dealt with properly since it can impact on one?s life and mentality in hundred and one negative ways.? ?
Although, there is no exact treatment to overcome fear, phobias should be dealt with carefully since it can result in poor quality of life.? ?
The main treatment for phobias include, Cognitive Behavioural Therapy, where affected individuals are taught and practiced how to manage their fearful feelings during insecure situations and modify their thoughts and attitudes towards those.??
So if you are one of those people who avoids certain things or circumstances due to an irrational-indescribable terror within which makes a negative impact on your quality of life, its high time to seek professional medical care and solve your problem.

The European Union (EU) and Sri Lanka had discussed unmet expectations of justice in the 'emblematic cases' in the country among many other areas of concern during the 21st meeting of the EU-Sri Lanka Joint Commission held on Thursday.
In a statement, the EU Embassy in Sri Lanka said progress with regard to the enactment of the International Convention on the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance Act, the further release of land and the normalisation of civilian life in the Northern and Eastern Provinces of Sri Lanka were also discussed during the meeting.
At the meeting, both sides had welcomed the formal restoration of the GSP Plus concession to Sri Lanka, providing duty free access for more than 80% of Sri Lankan exports to the European Union
Sri Lanka said that the restoration of GSP-plus had contributed to a near doubling of export growth.
The EU had re-emphasised its 'clear' and 'unwavering' expectation that urgent action would be taken by the Sri Lankan authorities to repeal the Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA) and replace it with legislation that is in line with international standards.
?Plans to resolve as soon as possible the situation of the remaining detainees held under the PTA were also discussed. In addition, there was discussion of the need to amend the Code of Criminal Procedure to ensure fundamental legal safeguards,? the statement said.
The parties agreed on a series of follow-up actions ahead of the next Joint Commission meeting in Brussels later in the year.
The meeting was co-chaired by Paola Pampaloni, Deputy Managing Director for Asia and Pacific of the European External Action Service and Foreign Affairs Ministry Secretary Prasad Kariyawasam. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

Goldman Sachs reports 4Q loss on big charge for US tax reform
	
AFP: Goldman Sachs reported a rare quarterly loss yesterday due to a one-time charge associated with US tax reform.
Performance across operating division was mixed, although the bank?s profits topped analyst expectations when the effect of the one-time item was excluded. The company?s shares fell in early trading.
The US investment banking giant reported a fourth-quarter loss of US $ 2.1 billion, compared with a profit of US $ 2.2 billion in the year-ago period.
Revenues in the fourth quarter fell 4.1 percent to US $ 7.8 billion.
Goldman?s first in a quarterly loss since 2011 was driven by US $ 4.4 billion in one-time charges, mostly due to US tax reform provisions on the repatriation of foreign earnings. The bank warned of the hit in December.
The charge also weighed on annual earnings, which fell 48 percent to US $ 3.7 billion.
Numerous large companies have made similar announcements of one-time negative effects from US tax reform in recent weeks.
But most, including Goldman Sachs, are bullish on the long-term effects of the US tax cuts, arguing they will lead to increasing revenues and faster economic growth.
Goldman Sachs Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein alluded to the tax cuts as a factor in an improving macro environment, in spite of the ?challenging environment for our market-making businesses,? according to a Goldman press release.
?With the global economy poised to accelerate, new US tax legislation providing tailwinds and a leading franchise across our businesses, we are well positioned to serve our clients and make significant progress on the growth plan we outlined in September,? Blankfein said.
In its bank operations, Goldman scored impressive gains in revenues from both debt and equity underwriting. Financial advisory revenues also increased.
On the downside, Goldman?s performance in its trading division, which has struggled in recent quarters amid low volatility, turned in another weak performance.
Revenues in this division slumped 34 percent from the year-ago period, weighed down especially by a 50 percent plunge from the closely-watched fixed income, commodities and currency trades.
As Goldman?s trading business has languished, it has made moves into banking for the public, an area dominated by rivals such as JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America and regional banks.
The online consumer lending and deposit platform Marcus originated more than US $ 2 billion in loans and drew more than US $ 5 billion in deposits last year, Goldman said.
Shares of Goldman Sachs fell 2.2 percent in early trading Wednesday to US $ 252.75.?

This crooked political appointee had held a high position in a State institution under the previous regime as well.? At that time, he handled the job of promoting tourist arrivals which gave him a good opportunity to spin money from contracts.
?His current job does not involve awarding contracts (for him to collect commissions.) So he is said to be making frequent foreign visits and claiming huge amounts of money as his expenses, they say.

Infrastructure development triggers threat of  deer  extinction
	
?
Environmentalists claim deer strolling across Trincomalee face the threat of extinction mainly due to infrastructure development. Although deer have always been a tourist attraction in Trincomalee, relevant authorities have failed to acknowledge the alarming threat to this endangered species.? ?
Commenting on this, Gonathota Environmental Organisation Chairman Anura Bandara told Lankadeepa that these animals have hitherto contributed to paint the beauty of Trincomalee.? ?
?After the end of the war, more tourists throng Trincomalee and a majority of them do not fail to snap at least one candid photograph with these tame animals. However, lunch sheets disposed in disarray by local tourists have fuelled the extinction of this species. These animals often devour leftovers on disposed polythene sheets, oblivious to the fact that what they consume ultimately determines their fate. However, the authorities have cleared arable land for infrastructure development efforts, thereby creating a scarcity of food for deer. It is sad to note that non-degradable polythene has been found in the digestive systems of deer carcasses. To add insult to injury, the many small tanks around Trincomalee from which deer used to consume water have been removed with the spread of the Dengue epidemic,? he said.? ?

?The satellite imagery and media reports suggest that China has established military establishments in Doklam near Indian borders which indicates that India?s security and strategic interests have been compromised,? said Congress spokesperson Randeep Singh Surjewala.??

Multi Finance gears up for 2018 with new director board
	
With a proud heritage of over 40 years of being in business, Multi Finance PLC (MFPLC) has been a source of strength to businesses and entrepreneurs in the urban, rural and SME markets, playing a pivotal role in contributing to the growth of the Sri Lankan economy.
The company?s acquisition by rapidly expanding conglomerate Fairway Holdings in June 2017 has created greater potential for the company to expand with the existing customers as well as exploring untapped credit markets.
Fairway Holdings, the leading property developer in luxury vertical solutions, has rapidly ventured into multiple business areas including leisure, financial services, waste management, aviation, trading, bio technology and aquatic resources. A key feature of this diversification has been Fairway?s ability to attract and sustain some of the best industry specialists from relevant segments, which has paved the way for MFPLC to be steered by a strong new management.

Serving as Independent Non-Executive Directors are the following: Dr. Ravi Ajith Fernando, Imal Fonseka, Prasann Leanage, Shelton Pieris, K.D.P.C. Abeysekera and W.A. Lakshaman.
As a result of the acquisition, MFPLC has experienced a rapid evolution, attracting the industry?s best talent to join its corporate management and expanding its existing branch network. The team is well-resourced with highly qualified financial specialists to identify customer requirements and offer the most pragmatic financial solutions.
?At present, MFPLC is one of the few finance companies in the country offering specialized solutions across a service portfolio consisting of fixed deposits, savings, leasing, business loans, multi draft, pawning, microfinance, trader finance and more,? commented Multi Finance PLC Executive Director/CEO Pushpike Jayasundera.
?Under the visionary direction of Fairway Holdings, we are confident of strengthening our decade-long identity of reliability and look forward to enhancing shareholder value through financial stability, growth and specialized financial services in the coming years.?
MFPLC is a licensed finance company under the Central Bank of Sri Lanka. MFPLC was established back in 1974 as a limited liability company in Kandy and re-registered under the 2007 Companies Act No.07 in 2009. It functions as a quoted company in the Colombo Stock Exchange.

Physiotherapy  can reduce  Urinary Incontinence
	
?
Urinary incontinence, also known as accidental bladder leakage, is an embarrassing problem that affects millions of women. Although it is more common in older women, it can affect younger women too. It is not a normal part of ageing or something that you just have to live with. The World Health Organization (WHO) reported that bladder control problems affect more than 200 million people globally. The WHO also said that incontinence? is a largely preventable? and treatable condition and that it?s ?certainly not an inevitable consequence of ageing?. The WHO adds ?the most typical reaction exhibited by patients when they are diagnosed with poor bladder control was not fear nor disbelief,?
but relief.?? ?
?
?
The NHS of UK estimates that between 3 and 6 million people in the UK have some degree of urinary incontinence. Women are more likely to suffer from stress urinary incontinence than men. That?s because of the effects of childbirth and the menopause. In 2004 an American survey (by the National Association for Continence) reported that women wait 6.5 years and men 4.2 years after beginning to experience bladder control problems before seeing a healthcare professional.? ?
Women are 5 times more likely to develop urinary incontinence compared to men.
?
What is Urinary Incontinence (UI)?in women?
Urinary Incontinence (UI) is the loss of bladder control, resulting in the accidental loss of urine. Some women may lose urine while running or coughing, called stress incontinence. Others may feel a strong, sudden need, or urgency, to urinate just before losing urine, called urgency incontinence.?
UI can be slightly bothersome or totally debilitating. For some women, the chance of embarrassment keeps them from enjoying many physical activities, including exercising.?
Causes?
Urinary incontinence in women results when the brain does not properly signal the bladder and the sphincters do not squeeze strongly enough, or both. The bladder muscle may contract too much or not enough because of a problem with the muscle itself or the nerves controlling the bladder muscle. Damage to the sphincter muscles themselves or the nerves controlling these muscles can result in poor sphincter function. These problems can range from simple to complex? ?
Birth defects?Problems with development of the urinary tract? ?
Genetics?A woman is more likely to have UI if other females in her family have UI? ?
Race?Caucasian women are more likely to be affected than Hispanic/Latina, African American, or Asian American women? ?
Childbirth?The childbirth process can damage the muscles and nerves that control urination? ?
Chronic coughing?Long-lasting coughing increases pressure on the bladder and pelvic floor muscles? ?
Menopause?Reduces production of the hormone that keeps the lining of the bladder and urethra healthy? ?
Neurological problems?Women with diseases or conditions that affect the brain and spine may have trouble controlling urination? ?
Physical inactivity?Decreased activity can increase a woman?s weight and contribute to muscle weakness? ?
Obesity?Extra weight can put pressure on the bladder, causing a need to urinate before the bladder is full? ?
Older age?Bladder muscles can weaken with time, leading to a decrease in the bladder?s capacity to store urine? ?
Pelvic organ prolapse?Causes sagging of the bladder, bowel, or uterus out of their normal positions? ?
Pregnancy?The fetus can put pressure on the bladder during pregnancy? ?
?
Types of UI in women
The two most common types of urine leakage in women are stress incontinence and urgency incontinence. Incontinence may be caused or worsened by medical problems, medications, and/or problems with the brain due to a stroke or dementia.? ?
Stress incontinence ? Stress incontinence occurs when the muscles and tissues around the urethra (where urine exits) do not stay closed properly when there is increased pressure (?stress?) in the abdomen, leading to urine leakage.??
Urgency incontinence ? In people with urgency incontinence (also called overactive bladder), there is a sudden, uncontrollable urge to urinate. You may leak urine on the way to the toilet. ?Normal? frequency is considered to be eight times per day and once at night, but this depends on how much you drink and may increase if you drink more than 64 ounces of fluid in a day.? ?
Mixed incontinence ? Women with symptoms of both stress and urgency incontinence are said to have mixed incontinence.? ?
Overflow incontinence ? Overflow incontinence occurs when the bladder does not empty completely, causing leakage when the bladder becomes overly full. It may result in symptoms of either stress or urgency incontinence or both.? ?
?
How physiotherapy can reduce urinary incontinence?
Physiotherapy is one of the best and most effective treatments for urinary incontinence. Not only is it a low-risk solution, but a good physiotherapist can help you retrain your bladder and strengthen your pelvic floor muscles.? ?
1. Stress incontinence: This refers to the involuntary need to urinate when there is increased intra-abdominal pressure ? such as coughing, jumping or running.?
2. Urge incontinence: Also known as an overactive bladder, this is characterized by an overwhelming need to urinate and the involuntary passing of urine because of this.
3. Mixed incontinence: This is a combination of both forms.? ?
A physiotherapist should be able to diagnose the type of incontinence following a short examination which includes obtaining details about your bladder control, your health history including any surgeries or pregnancies, your diet and your current lifestyle.? ?
?
Exercises and treatments
One of the methods physiotherapists? uses is behavioral modification, which involves re-learning how to go to the toilet and learning how to effectively empty the bladder.?
Pelvic Floor Exercises are probably the most well-known forms of exercise for pelvic dysfunction.?
Neuromuscular stimulation is another method used which activates nerves and their associated muscles.?
Weighted vaginal cones are plastic, cone-shaped devices which the physiotherapist inserts into the vagina to help exercise the pelvic floor muscles. Weights can be added to them or removed and they work by gradually stretching the vaginal opening as the cone drops lower. This stimulates the pelvic floor. Bladder retraining literally means retraining the bladder how to work.?
?
These are some tips:
1. Don?t pee ?just in case?: Try to wait a little longer when you feel the need to urinate, which will stretch the bladder and encourage it to hold bigger volumes.? ?
2. Keep calm: When the urge to go appears, try to sit down and hold a pelvic floor contraction hard enough to prevent leakage.??
3. Keep hydrated: Don?t restrict your fluid intake.
4. Limit caffeine and alcohol: Some bladders react negatively to caffeine and alcohol.? ?
?
How can a?physio help?
Physiotherapists have an essential role to play in the assessment, treatment and prevention of urinary incontinence.? ?
?
A physio can:?
Help prevent and manage incontinence.? ?
	Assist with bladder retraining and calming techniques.? ?
	Demonstrate correct coughing, sneezing and bracing techniques.? ?
	Liaise with other health professionals.? ?
?

	Demonstrate correct coughing, sneezing and bracing techniques.? ?

Prevention
Pregnancy and childbirth are the greatest risk factors for developing UI in women. It is essential that all women receive information on how to exercise their pelvic floor muscles during pregnancy. There is no need to suffer the embarrassment of incontinence in silence ? seek help.? ?Physiotherapy is a cost-effective, low-risk solution.? Access to practicing pelvic floor exercises during pregnancy decreases the risk of incontinence following childbirth.? ?

?PM?s resilience to criticism is an example to all?
	
In politics, one should be ready to stand criticism
Attorney General can only take action regarding bond scam
If there is any loss, it can be recovered from frozen assets of PTL
Highways and Higher Education Minister Lakshman Kiriella in an interview with the Daily Mirror spoke about the present status in politics in the wake of the action taken by President Maithripala Sirisena regarding the bond scam. Following are excerpts of the interview done with Minister Kiriella.?
?QPresident Maithripala Sirisena staged a walkout from the Cabinet meeting on Tuesday. What is your view?
In politics, one has to bear with criticism. Today, you can see Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe. What a scathing attack is made against him by some sections of the media? Yet, he does not care about it. He always responds to criticism with a smile on his face.? ?
QWhat is the response of the United National Party (UNP) to the statement made by the President regarding the bond scam??
The report is a collection of materials. There are recommendations that have been made. It has been sent to the Attorney General. We await the action that the Attorney General is going to take. He will take appropriate action.? ?
Demonstrations in the Well of the House should not be tolerated
QHow keen is the UNP to get these recommendations implemented?
As the Prime Minister said it was to be implemented as soon as the COPE report was out. It was sent to the Attorney General in 2016. That is to see if anyone can be prosecuted. We have done that willingly. This is the first time, a COPE report was sent to the Attorney General. There were over 20 or 30 COPE reports in the past, but not a single one was sent to the Attorney General. In one report submitted by MP Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe as the COPE Chairman, there was a case connected to Rs.150 billion. Nothing happened about it.? ?
QBut, the COPE report was sent to the Attorney General way back in October, 2016. No action has been taken as of now. What is your response?
It is up to the Attorney General. The AG should have gone through it and taken necessary action if necessary.? ?
QIn the latest report, there are some recommendations to work out fresh legislations to recover the loss caused to the Government. You, as the Leader of the House, have a responsibility in the enactment of laws. How do you act in this regard?
We are ready to work out laws if necessary. The Attorney General should make relevant recommendations in consultation with the Central Bank for it. We are ready to enact them for sure.?
The deans of state medical faculties are in agreement with us. The Government Medical Officers? Association is a trade union
?QHow has this affected relationship between the President and the United National Party (UNP)?
There is no impact on relations. Before the President, we sent the COPE report to the Attorney General. The President is now doing the same thing we did one year ago. There is no animosity. We all want to get to the bottom of the whole affair. Only the Attorney General can point a finger at anybody. He will peruse evidence. It is he, who has the power to prosecute anyone.?
QWhat is your message to the Attorney General?
We all want to get to the bottom of it. In bond transactions, people make money. We have to find out whether any unlawful profit has been made in this transaction. You cannot charge a person for making money. Yet, if the profit has been made unlawfully, he or she can be charged.? ?
QWhat is your view on what happened in Parliament when the Prime Minister made a statement?
Who asked for the debate? The SLFP, the Joint Opposition and the JVP asked for it. They asked for a report knowing well that the report had not been tabled. Why did they do it? We said we were ready for it. They said they were not ready. Could we have discussed everything?? ?
?
The opposition was not ready for a debate. They are the ones who stormed into the Well of the House. It was not us.? ?
Before President, UNP sent COPE report to AG
QYet, the UNP backbenchers confronted them. What is your view?
There must be retaliation. It has been the custom of the Joint Opposition to get into the Well of the House even regarding a trivial matter. If they were keen on the debate, they should have replied the Prime Minister after his statement.? ?
QDo you suggest that demonstrations in the Well of the House should not be tolerated?
Yes. It should not be tolerated. During the past three years, the Joint Opposition trooped into the Well of the House even for a minor matter. It has become a fashion now. Since the loss is Rs.11 billion, the Government had frozen financial assets worth Rs.12 billion belonging to Perpetual Treasuries Ltd. If the Attorney General confirms it and holds Arjun Aloysius responsible, his assets have been already frozen. The money is available. There has to be prosecution. There is nothing to panic.? ?
QThese bonds are now traded in the market. So, the impact will be felt in the long run. It will be a continuous hemorrhage on the economy. What is your response?
All what you say has to be established in a court of law. The opposition can only make accusations.? ?
President now does what we did one year ago
QAt this election, the UNP is pitted against President Sirisena?s Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP). How will it affect the future of the Government?
As far as the UNP is concerned, we are the largest party in the Government. We are confident of having this UNP-led Government till 2020. It is better for you to wait till February 10. Then, you will know who has the mandate to run the country.? ?
QWhat is your position regarding the President making reference to the Supreme Court on the limit of his term?
The Supreme Court?s opinion shows that our judiciary is so independent. It is devoid of political influence. Yet, the constituent parties were not consulted by the President. It created uneasiness in the Government?s allies.?
?QWhat are your plans in the higher education sector?
We have created three medical colleges. Money has been allocated for all. We have created 11 faculties to teach technological subjects in the universities. This is so important. Within the next five years, the number of students attending these faculties will be higher than the number attending the Arts Faculties. These new subjects are Biosystems Technology, Engineering Technology and IT? ?
We want to promote science-based education more. We have given autonomy to the universities. The Vice Chancellors and the Senates have to run the universities. They must be accountable, though. The hostel issue will be addressed in 2018 once and for all. We have increased Mahapola bursaries. We will produce employable graduates.? ?
QWhat is the latest progress in relation to SAITM?
SAITM will be abolished. We will do it. We have introduced minimum standards. What more then?? ?
Supreme Court?s opinion on President?s term shows how independent Sri Lanka?s judiciary is
QSAITM students will be attached to a new institution?
We have created two new bodies. One is to absorb present students to one body. They will continue with their studies there. That is for the present students. The deans of state medical faculties are in agreement with us. The Government Medical Officers? Association is a trade union. They have no right to determine the nature of medical education.? ? ?

While claiming that the page 854 of final bond report had categorically articulated that the statement proclaimed by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe in parliament on March 17, 2105 that the former Governor Arjuna Mahendran did not intervene into the issuance of bonds, was untrue,
General Secretary of Pivithuru Hela Urumaya (PHU), MP Udaya Gammanpila said yesterday that PM should either resign from his office for misleading parliament or they would take the initiative to file a No Confidence Motion against the PM.
Addressing a news conference he said the mentioned incident was sufficient enough to file a No Confidence Motion against the PM.
Meanwhile, he said even though the Presidential Commission of Inquiry (PCoI) report which was submitted to President Maithripala Sirisena on January 3, consisted of 1,257 pages, the report submitted to parliament on Wednesday only had 1,154 pages.
President Sirisena must make a special announcement as to what happened to the rest of the [103] pages. At the same time, it was questionable as to why former Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake was handed over a Commission Report before it was presented to Parliament.
?The said incident leads to a suspicion that the missing pages (103) have been removed out of the report in favour of the former Finance Minister who had a look at the report earlier. Therefore, we insist President Sirisena should deliver a statement with regard to the controversial incident and take pertinent steps with immediate effect,? Gammanpila said.
Nevertheless, he said although Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe had proclaimed that the appointment of former Governor Arjuna Mahendran was done in accordance with the consensus of the President and the government, the President himself and several other ministers had opposed to the appointment.
?Some crucial questions could have been raised at the bond commission when the Premier was summoned to give the evidences. But such crucial questions such as why Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe took over the management of the Central Bank - which was under the purview of the Ministry of Finance, appointing Arjuna Mahendran as Governor of the Central Bank despite being aware that he was a citizen of Singapore and why he had been appointed despite the President had opposed to it etc., should have been raised when the Premier had appeared before the PCoI,? Gammanpila said.
He said if those questions were raised, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe would have been found guilty of the bond scam. (Sheain Fernandopulle)

PTL actual profit around Rs 18, 200mn: VAC
	
Although the loss to the country as a result of the bond had been to be Rs. 11,500 million in the report of the Presidential Commission of inquiry (PCoI) into the Central Bank bond issuance that occurred in 2015 and 2016, the actual profit made by Perpetual Treasuries Ltd (PTL) was Rs.18, 200 million, the Voice Against Corruption (VAC) said yesterday.
VAC Convener Wasantha Samarasinghe said it is questionable whether the Central Bank had done its duty properly as it had failed to track some Rs 6,813 million earnings of the PTL.
He said the PCoI was given authority to probe the bonds issued until March 31, 2016 but former Central Bank Governor Arjuna Mahendran had stayed in office until July 2016.
Mr. Samarasinghe said until September 2016, PTL owner Arjun Aloysius has presented reports of profit and loss of the Perpetual Treasuries Limited.
During the six months from April 2016 to September 2016 PTL had received an income of Rs 6,813 million and it had not included to the PCoI report as the investigation was only until March 31, 2016.
According to the PCoI Report he said Rs 11,500 million loss to the State was on what was earned by PTL during the period that ended on March 31, 2016 and therefore only this sum could be recovered from them.
He added that the PTL had received a total profit of around Rs 18,250 million during the 30 months from March 1, 2015 to March 31, 2017.
Therefore he said the commission had only published accounts for six months but the loss incurred after March 31, 2016 was yet with PTL.
He said that from March 31, 2017 to September 30, 2017 Perpetual Treasuries had earned Rs 316 million which would be in their books along with the interest thereon as they were not able to function in the secondary market during this time.
Therefore he said over Rs 6 billion in profits which they earned from the bond scam was still with the company. ?Aloysius is attempting to withdraw the money from the Perpetual Treasuries bank accounts as he know the total profit made by the PTL after the report came out,? he said.
Furthermore, he said Aloysius still had treasury bonds left over from February 2015 and some were transferred to other companies. Therefore those bond transactions should be probed separately, pointed out.?We request President Maithripala Sirisena to appoint a second Presidential Commission to probe the rest of the bond fraud,? he added.

Ridiculing our saviour is an ungrateful act: Ranjan
	
The incumbent President who was referred to as our saviour and only hope on January 8, 2015 is now being ridiculed by some of our ungrateful ministers and MPs, something that I do not condone at all, said the Deputy Minister of Social Welfare and Up Country Development Ranjan Ramanayake, speaking at the Mathalaya in Attanagalla on Tuesday (16).
Certain derogatory names had been used when referring to the President by these groups and in my opinion it is not right to make use of him and then toss him aside.
Mr. Ramanayake said the UNP, which he represents, consisted of those who were alleged to be involved in the Central Bank bond scam which took place recently in a report put out by the Presidential Commission of Inquiry (PCoI) which was appointed by the President to look into irregularities that took place in the issuance of treasury bonds in 2015 and 2016.
The Deputy Minister further said that showing gratitude is a virtue that should be present in any party and regretted that this quality was found to be at somewhat of a low level inside the UNP. (Pushpakumara Mallawarachchi)

Saudi crown prince boasts he has Trump?s backing for  November ?coup?
	
?
The Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia has boasted that he had the backing of President Donald Trump for his November ?coup,? a source in the country has told DailyMail.com.??
Prince Mohammed bin Salman, now the de facto ruler of Saudi Arabia, told his close aides that Trump had given his explicit support for a power grab, which involved the arrests of 11 princes and hundreds of officials and businessmen in midnight raids across the kingdom.??
A source close to the Saudi leader, known by his initials MBS, told DailyMail.com that Salman ?bragged? about his cozy relationship with the U.S. president and his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, claiming that the president backed Salman?s takeover.??
The claim closely matches an insider account in Michael Wolff?s explosive book ?Fire and Fury? that the president told his friends, ?We?ve put our man on top!? ? implying that he and Kushner had engineered the Saudi coup.? The princes, including one of the world?s richest men, Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, were arrested suddenly at the beginning of November, held in the Ritz-Carlton in Riyadh, and - a source told Dailymail.com later that month - being tortured.??
The White House declined to comment to DailyMail.com but Wolff?s book revealed the warm relations with MBS and reported how Trump told friends: ?Jared?s gotten the Arabs totally on our side. Done deal.??
Wolff writes that Salman, 32, befriended Kushner, 37, after the U.S. election, and ?offered himself to Kushner as his guy in the Saudi kingdom.???

SL delays implementing pledges to UN: HRW
	
The Sri Lankan Government has stalled on its key pledges to provide justice for conflict-related violations and to strengthen human rights protections, the Human Rights Watch (HRW) said today in its 2018 World Report.
It said the government took some steps in 2017 to reduce restrictions on speech and assembly, but there was little progress on transitional justice initiatives agreed to at the UN Human Rights Council in 2015.
In the 643-page World Report, its 28th edition, Human Rights Watch reviews human rights practices in more than 90 countries.
HRW South Asia Director Meenakshi Ganguly said victims of abuses who struggled for years seeking justice finally had a moment of hope two years ago when Sri Lanka pledged to the UN to take action.
?Since then, victims have received many words but little action. The government needs to put a timetable in place for meeting its pledges to the world and to the Sri Lankan people,? she said.
While the government conducted national consultations on issues around the resolution, the HRW said the government has since failed to act on the recommendations.
?In July 2017, the government announced that it would operationalize an Office on Missing Persons. But there was no meaningful progress on the other three justice mechanisms, most notably a judicial mechanism to prosecute those responsible on all sides for grave crimes committed during the country?s civil war,? it said.
It said the government released many of those long detained under the PTA but offered no reparations or apologies to those arbitrarily held.
?The government has yet to take meaningful steps to reform laws criminalizing same-sex relations. Muslim women campaigned for amendments to discriminatory marriage laws,? it said.
UN member countries should urge the Sri Lankan Government to deliver on its commitments when Sri Lanka appear before the Human Rights Council in March 2018, for an interim report by the high commissioner for human rights.

"Sri Lanka has been named as a high risk country for investment"
	
President should have taken quicker and stronger action than this in connection with the Bond ScamBarring the two frauds under this Govt. no bond scam has taken place in Sri Lanka since 1997?PM?s unfounded allegation about scams will erode investor confidence in local bond salesPresident dissolved P?ment in 2015 to protect PM and UNPNobody can put the blame on JO for mayhem in P?mentThe Government, which the President represents, is under fire
Joint Opposition MP Bandula Gunawardane speaking to?Dailymirror about the implications of the controversial bond scam and the seriousness of Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe?s allegation regarding similar frauds in the past. Following are excerpts of the interview done with Gunawardane.
QYou engaged the Central Bank Governor on the bond scam. What is next?
?
?
The Joint Opposition made the most rigorous campaign against the controversial bond transaction ever since it took place on February 27, 2015. First we attempted to get the Central Bank Governor Arjuna Mahendran removed as he is the principal person responsible for the scam. Then we wanted to take punitive action against all those who are responsible. Unfortunately it didn?t happen. The COPE chaired by former Minister D.E.W. Gunasekara during the previous Parliament conducted the first in-depth investigation into this bond issue. All details were found. Also, the wrongdoers were identified. Unfortunately, Parliament was dissolved a day prior to the submission of the report. It was done in order to save the United National Party (UNP) and its leadership. President Maithripala Sirisena happened to dissolve Parliament. Once again, on March 27, 2016, the second bond scam took place. The chairmen of the three main state banks of Sri Lanka- Bank of Ceylon, National Savings Bank and the People?s Bank- testified and implicated the name of then Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake who asked the banking authorities to make low bids in the bond sale.? ?
In fact, we insisted right from the beginning that legal action should be instituted against all those responsible. We demanded the arrest of Mr. Mahendran upon his return to the country, at the airport itself
In fact, we insisted right from the beginning that legal action should be instituted against all those responsible. We demanded the arrest of Mr. Mahendran upon his return to the country, at the airport itself.? ?
Anika Wijesuriya who gave evidence against Mr.Karunanayake had to flee the country for her safety.? ?QThe Prime Minister in his statement said that there were similar frauds during 2008 and 2014. You were part of that Government. What is your response to this allegation??
I, along with current President Maithripala Sirisena, was part of that Government. We are collectively bound to the decisions taken by that Government. Both of us are held responsible for this allegation by the Prime Minister in that sense. I can vouch that barring the two frauds committed under the present rule no bond scam has taken place since 1997. Bonds are traded in the primary and secondary markets. In case of a fraud, the bond market itself sends an alarming signal to those involved in trading. It happens virtually. If a stranger tries to steal a vehicle, its alarm system will start ringing. No stranger can drive a vehicle away with an alarm system.? ?
During the previous UNP regimes, we came under attacks by police personnel who came in the guise of goons
So, nobody can stake a claim that he is the one who discovered this fraud first. It is untrue. The bond market itself emitted signals about fraudulent activities happening in the process.? ?
Treasury Bills and Treasury Bonds are unique instruments used by the Government to raise money for its requirements. Investors trust them fully in putting their money on the ground. There is a risk involved in investing in other sectors. Yet, in the investment of money in Government securities, there is less. When such transactions are termed unlawful by the Prime Minister, no investor will come forward to invest in them. The bond market of Sri Lanka is in grave jeopardy today because of the Prime Minister?s statement made amid din in the House last week.? ?
Since Independence, this is the most controversial statement to be made by a Prime Minister. The Prime Minister said Rs.4702 billion were raised through bonds. The Prime Minister said it was done unlawfully without the approval of the Central Bank?s Monetary Board. These bonds, issued at that time, are still traded in the market. Investors will have second thoughts in investing in Sri Lanka?s bond market hereafter. The international media covered this. It reflects badly on Sri Lanka.??
Foreigners will tend to withdraw their money invested in bonds here. Secondly, Sri Lanka Treasury Bonds will yield less in the future because investors have lost confidence. Sri Lanka has been already named as a high risk country for investment. This is our country. We have to protect it. If the financial market collapses, no one will be able to resurrect it.? ?
QThe Prime Minister said an investigation should be conducted into the bond transactions during that period. What is your view?
We are asking him to conduct any investigation within a matter of a few days. The Stock Exchange started deteriorating in 2015. The Government is still unable to put it on track. It collapsed because Mr. Karunanayake as the Finance Minister started a witch-hunt on the private sector. He introduced a super gain tax with retrospective effect. He dubbed some private sector people as fraudsters. The Government got as much as Rs.50 billion from the private sector by way of super gain tax. It is twice the size of money invested for the construction of the Mattala Airport.
Nobody can put the blame on the Joint Opposition for mayhem created in Parliament the other day. We did not go to Parliament to listen to a mere statement by the Prime Minister
? ?QWhat do you think of the President?s present reaction to the bond scam?
The President should have opted for quicker and stronger actions than these. The Government, which the President represents, is under fire. He has a greater responsibility regarding these issues. He should summon the officials of Central Bank including the Governor. It should be his duty. He should also summon the Auditor General. After that, this matter should be discussed. Otherwise, it will be difficult for the Government to make borrowings to run its affairs.? ?
In the history of Sri Lanka, we have heard that such financial frauds even led to the assassination of political leaders. There is unconfirmed evidence that frauds related to shipping transactions led to the assassination of S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike. This is an unconfirmed report, though. Therefore, we ask not to allow those responsible for the bond fraud to be at large. They have to be arrested. It is dangerous for them to be allowed to remain unshackled.?
The bond market of Sri Lanka is in grave jeopardy today because of the Prime Minister?s statement made amid din in the House last week
??
Nobody can put the blame on the Joint Opposition for mayhem created in Parliament the other day. We did not go to Parliament to listen to a mere statement by the Prime Minister. Unless we are given the opportunity to make our voice heard, we will have to resort to other methods to drive home our point of view. We do not have the opposition leader?s post. Also, we do not have the post of the Chief Opposition Whip. We only have Mr. Dinesh Gunawardane to represent us in the party leaders? meetings. We represent the genuine opposition of the people. We only demonstrated in the Well of the House using posters. The fracas took place after they confronted us and snatched away our posters. The Speaker could have avoided it. He should have adjourned the session. One MP collapsed on the floor of the Well. There were fisticuffs. But, The Speaker is silent. People respect the Supreme Court because lawyers do not involve themselves in physical brawls. They are engaged in enlightened legal arguments with each other. If all get involved in fisticuffs, people will not respect even the court. This is the type of conduct in the place where law is practiced. Then, the conduct in the place where law is made should be even more exemplary.? ?
It is unbecoming of any Prime Minister in the world to shout slogans in the House along with his MPs.? ?QYet, the Joint Opposition only stormed into the Well of the House first. What do you say about that?
It happens when we are not given an opportunity at all to air our grievances. In the past, TNA MP M.K. Sivajilingam removed his shirt and protested. UNP MP T. Maheswaran did it. Also, there were floral wreaths smuggled into the House.??
Investors will have second thoughts in investing in Sri Lanka?s bond market hereafter. The international media covered this. It reflects badly on Sri Lanka
?
During the previous UNP regimes, we came under attacks by police personnel who came in the guise of goons. We faced such a situation when proceeding towards Parliament in a bus. This is a bad example anyway.? ? ?

The battle against acne A medical memento
	
?
When recalling your teenage years there may be many good memories that make you yearn for the good old days. However past acne problems might discourage you from wanting to reminisce your teen years. Tough luck if you are in your youth and facing an acne battle. This week?s edition of the Health Capsule will help you understand and better equip yourself with the reinforcements that you need to survive the ever-existing battle between youth and acne.? ?
Consultant Dermatologist, Dr. Nayani Madarasingha spoke about acne and addresseed all issues that revolve around this topic.? ?
?Acne (also known as pimples) is a disorder of the sebaceous glands. Sebaceous glands are oil glands located in your skin. They are connected to the hair follicles. Secretions of the sebaceous glands open to the skin through the pores in your skin. When the pores of the skin get blocked, secretions accumulate. This leads to inflammation followed by bacterial infection subsequently causing acne,? explained Dr. Madarasingha.? ?
This condition commonly occurs in adolescents during the initial stages of hormonal changes that they undergo. However some people in their middle ages too fall victim to acne. Acne conditions prevail persistently during adolescence, but improves after reaching the age of 20. However there is a smaller percentage who suffer from acne longer-term, even upon reaching ages 30-40.? ?
?
Causative Factors? ?
Dr. Madarasingha speaks about the causes of acne. ?Reagents in creams and other substances that you apply on your face, (fairness creams, etc) can lead to acne. Hormonal imbalance disorders such as polycystic ovarian disease can lead to acne. Acne emerges as a symptom to polycystic ovarian disease amongst other symptoms such as obesity, hair loss and menstrual problems. These are the most common causes for acne,? she mentioned. It is said that food items such as dairy products and sweets can aggravate acne. However this does not affect all people and it causes acne only in some.? ?
?Acne starts off as a comedone commonly known as white heads and black heads. Due to inflammation, they become larger and red in colour. Upon bacterial infection, they become yellow due to pus. Acne could aggravate into a very severe condition which appear in the form of lumps and cysts,? she informed.? ?
?
Permanent damage?
Once acne heals, dark spots are left in the skin. This is known as acne pigmentation. The Dermatologist stated that pigmentation caused by acne usually fades away on its own unless the condition is severe and has caused scarring. ?Scars are caused by permanent damage to the skin and may not completely dissappear,? she warned.? ?
It is very important to focus on how to control acne. ?Acne leaves pigmentation on the skin. This black mark fades away with time. But in severe cases of acne, a scar is left behind. This causes permanent damage to the skin and may not heal. Therefore in order to prevent scars, early treatment during acne is important,? Dr. Madarasingha stressed.? ?
?
Treatment? ?
The treatment of acne depends on the severity of the condition. This ranges from light acne break out to moderate or severe conditions. ?When it comes to severe stages, taking oral medication becomes necessary in order to control it. Additional treatment such as chemical peels are also done to control acne. People often have the tendency to? request medication over the counter at a pharmacy or sticking to a medication that their friends follow. This is not encouraged. It is important to keep in mind that treatment of acne depends on your type of skin and the severity level of acne,? she advised.? ?
Acne treatment takes a time period of about 3-6 months. It is not something that can be decided or done in the last minute. Early consultations with your dermatologist is of importance,? she explicated. By appropriate and early treatment through medication the chance of seeing scars left behind from acne can be minimized. Dr. Madarasinghe also highlighted that once acne is controlled medication should not be stopped. ?Medication should be continued for 3-6 months,? she stated.? ?
The treatment for acne scars also depends on the type of skin and type and severity of the scars. There are different treatments available namely chemical peels, microneedling, laser and platelet rich plasma (PRP). ?Treating scars can take a very long time ranging from 6-12 months and repeated sessions are needed. These treatments will reduce the visibility of scars very successfully,? she added.? ?
?
?Prevention? ?
On the prevention of acne, there are limitations regarding what we can do to prevent acne from breaking out. But it is essential to keep these facts in mind and follow them. Avoiding the use of various creams on your face sans consultation is one such way you could prevent acne. The most important factor is not to prick or pop pimples as the tendency of scarring your skin increases when you meddle with your acne.? ?
Next is a factor that doesn?t affect everybody, but a small fraction of people. That is the diet. Foods such as sweets and dairy products have the probability of causing and aggravating acne in some patients. They should be careful when consuming such foods and should try to avoid them.? ??
All in all, acne is a condition that requires medical attention. ?Very effective medicine is available to control acne. It is important to keep in mind that early treatment can prevent acne scars,? Dr. Madarasingha concluded.? ? ?

The pizza was very tasty, even to a cat
	
A manager in a private firm in Colombo was placed in a difficult position after a cat that frequents the office helped itself to the pizza left for his employees in the lunch room.
This manager in question was in the habit of rewarding his employees for their hard work with treats that he ordered from out.
This time he had ordered pizza which he planned to serve to them at teatime. He had spent a good sum on his 'treat'. The time came for them to help themselves to the food, but what greeted them when they entered the eating room brought fits of laughter to some and consternation to the manager who had spent a tidy sum on the pizza. A cat was happily devouring their 'treat'.
Since there was nothing left to do he gave what was left of the pizza to the cat and ordered another expensive pizza for his employees. (Akila Baddewithana)

The story of Insulin
	
?
As we advance into a future with technology and enhance knowledge about ourselves and the world around us, it?s hard to imagine that there was a time that our understanding of the world was so much less than today, just a few decades ago. If we were to trace back the steps into history, we would realize that we have reached where we are today, through the contributions of thousands of people, their innovative ideas which led to new discoveries and inventions.??
?If we observe those pathway more closely, we could fathom that at some points in the past, there were ?giant leaps? in terms of discoveries, that changed the course of the world. Take for instance the discovery that the sun didn?t circle around the earth after all, but the earth did. This idea revolutionized people?s thinking, opening up an endless world of opportunities for a number of sciences. This has been the same with? medicine. A single discovery, an exact pathway of a certain disease and a medication can change the lives of billions of people who are not even born yet.? ?
?
Death sentence
The discovery of insulin was one such milestone in medicine. Until the early 1900?s people?s knowledge on Diabetes was highly limited. They knew that with regard to this disease the blood sugar levels shot up, sugar passed with urine and this condition soon led to dehydration and inevitably death.??
?If you had developed Diabetes, there were two courses of actions that you could follow. One is that you could go on a highly restricted diet, as advised by the doctors those days, which eventually led to death by starvation, due to the severity of diet. The second option is that you could choose to ignore the doctor?s advice and soon succumb to death as a result of a coma due to high blood sugar or severe dehydration.? ?
?
Banting and best
Scientists were suspecting that lack of a substance in a person?s pancreas may contribute to this condition, but numerous attempts to extract this ?substance? had failed. It was at a time like this that Dr. Frederick Banting of Canada, together with Chares Best; a medical student, started a series of experiments to extract this substance, with the facilities provided by the physiologist J.J.R Mcleod of the Toronto University. They initially conducted experiments on pancreases extracted from dogs, then moved to pancreas obtained from to calf and bulls.? ?
?
Discovery?
Eventually, they managed to isolate the ?substance?, and with Macleod?s advice, named it Insulin. Even though it takes only two and three sentences to summarize what they achieved, the result, as in any worthy endeavor, were obtained after many failed experiments, hardships and disagreements. After their experiments with dogs proved a success, they moved on to the harder task of testing insulin on human subjects. For this, they were joined by the biochemist, J.B Collip, who managed to purify their extract of pancreatic substances.??
?
The unthinkable?
Today, almost every person knows what Insulin is, and although other new drugs have been invented for Diabetes since then, it?s still the mainstay of treatment for Type 1 Diabetes. Frederick Banting and Charles Best; an average doctor from a poor farming family and a medical student, along with their small team, proved to the world that you can make the ?unthinkable? a possibility, if you dedicate yourself to the course.? -For their discovery which brought hope to thousands of people, and billions yet to be born, Banting and Macleod went on to receive the Nobel Prize for Physiology in 1923, and the two of them went on to share the prize money with Best and Collip, respectively.
?
Witnessing the miracle
Finally, a 14-year-old boy who was at the brink of the death managed to be the first human subject to experience and benefit from this new miracle medicine. Many such miracles have followed.?
?It?s said that during those days, there were wards where small children who were suffering from Type 1 Diabetes and had the complication called diabetic ketoacidosis, were held.?
They were just lying there, around fifty small kids, insensible, while the grieving parents sat next to them, awaiting their deaths. Literature explains the dramatic moment where the team visited this ward and went to inject each child with the extracted insulin. While they were injecting the last few children, the first to receive the injection were just waking up, amidst the joyous cries of their loved ones.
People who hadn?t had a proper meal for months and years for the fear of death were able to enjoy meals again.??

The third of four articles delving into the problems in our film industry Left in a crevice Reflecti
	
Pre-bourgeois civilisations did not operate on a rift between art and non-art like this because in those societies, art was a product of human labour, not intelectualisation
Art house audiences are drawn to their conception of the cinema in much the same way that those who flock to see Doctor Nawariyan are drawn to theirs
Modernism was a consequence of industrial capitalism, in that art more or less became an experience withdrawn from the majority
For decades we have been told that, regardless of the fact that movies are based on blatant falsifications of reality, we have to assess the medium on the basis of its fidelity to that same reality. This is probably why we take for granted the oppositions between art and entertainment. Such oppositions are a reflection of the thesis by Ananda Coomaraswamy that modern sensibility has differentiated between objects for consumption and those for discriminating tastes, or as Regi Siriwardena put it, between a Chinese porcelain vase in the drawing room and a kitchen clay pot from Kelaniya. Probably no other industry has this dichotomy done more harm to than the film industry, and for good reason: it?s the most technologically driven art form.? ?
I would like to propose here that art house audiences are drawn to their conception of the cinema in much the same way that those who flock to see Doctor Nawariyan are drawn to theirs: on both counts, it?s an act of self-congratulation. I am aware that I am generalising here but such generalisations are meant (in this series of essays) to be more suggestive than definitive. So here?s what my suggestion leads me to: the theory, validated by personal experiences on my part, that the cinema is far, far away from redeeming reality. Those who believe that movies can thrive on theories about reality and the redemption thereof through the art house sector are, frankly, deluding themselves. They have their coterie and they have a loyal following. But they are mostly purveyors of a minority art. They survive on patronage. Not popularity.? ?
Pre-bourgeois civilisations did not operate on a rift between art and non-art like this because in those societies, art was a product of human labour, not intelectualisation. Modernism was a consequence of industrial capitalism, in that art more or less became an experience withdrawn from the majority. But even in the modernist era ? as one can infer in the writings of such critics as Walter Benjamin ? we didn?t witness a separation of academia from general audiences. There were writers and critics and intellectuals who communicated what they felt to be art (with or without a capital A) to the consumers of that art. Modernism thrived on a linear conception of culture. What postmodernism achieved was the separation of academics and critics from their readers. Culture was no longer seen as linear. Consequently, the search for order, for any form of meaning, no longer seemed necessary for these new critics.? ?
Of all art forms it was probably the novel that had to bear an undue burden with respect to this paradigm shift, since the novel, more than even the movies or the theatre, was a text, an inheritance from the same 19th century bourgeois civilisation that postmodernism sought to combat, and in this age of postmodernist polemics, texts no longer depended on a definitive author: their meanings were dependent on what the reader wanted them to be. Extrapolating from this, Barthes?s assertion of the death of the author gave way to a culture of criticism whereby singularity, and coherence, no longer was deemed necessary. That is why most of those postmodernist polemics ? be it the notion of ?intertextuality? or the ?distancing? of the author from his own text ? were absorbed in other art forms quickly: because they were so pervasive as to intrude on everyone?s individual perceptions of those art forms, especially the cinema, where talked of the death of the auteur, or the death of the director as a film?s author.? ?
The result was an implosion of intelectualisations and a diminishment of sincerity. The preoccupation of the director in this new era was to do away with a need for any narrative (the postmodernist?s lack of regard for what are commonly referred to as ?grand narratives?, which are buttressed by cultural or other hegemonies in a given society, is his most distinctive quality), and although it took a long, long time after Dharmasena Pathiraja brought about a New Wave and succeeded Lester James Peries, it nevertheless made inroads in Sri Lanka. But for this postmodern revolution to materialise and be disseminated more effectively throughout the country, it had to be conveyed to the masses, a largely Sinhala and Tamil speaking population. That?s when the X-Group came in: they took it upon themselves to fulfil the role they were evidently ordained for, at a time when Barthes and Derrida didn?t make sense to the lay Sri Lankan reader. That they succeeded in part speaks volumes about whether we actually wanted to make sense of the writers and academics they translated for us.? ?
an inheritance from the same 19th century bourgeois civilisation that postmodernism sought to combat, and in this age of postmodernist polemics, texts no longer depended on a definitive author
In pre-bourgeois societies art was for the most self-referential. It depended on the standards that it had created for itself. Even when those standards ? one can think of perspective in drawing, or tonality in music ? were supposedly demolished, they depended for the most on the assumption that those demolishing them, like Picasso in drawing and Jean-Luc Godard in the cinema, were aware of these foundational standards. Postmodernism did away with any need to know the latter, because of which it became a withdrawn experience that was easy to purvey: all you needed to do was fill your objet d?art with vast obfuscations which, if you didn?t understand them, were supposed to test your intelligence and your creativity. From the richness of the paintings that the Modernists and the Pre-Raphaelites came up with, we have now entered an age in which a solitary orange dot on the centre of a white canvas can compel aahs and oohs and positive comments from ?discerning? spectators.? ?
Simply put, therefore, art was no longer considered as self-referential. It?s easy for it not to be, harder for it to be. And why exactly? Because there was no need for objectivity. ?There are no facts, only interpretation,? Nietzsche quipped: it would be in this postmodern era that the truth of its validity would be tested. With one important caveat: it wasn?t just facts that postmodernism sought to do away with, but also the cultural values, or any unifying factor, that would validate such facts.?
It?s hence probably no cause for wonderment that along with Nietzsche, postmodernist philosophers and academics were heavily influenced by Althusser (his notion of the ideological state apparatus) and Gramsci (his notion of hegemony): these were the backdrop figures for a whole new critical culture, and they eventually found their way to art forms that had not experienced this kind of critical polemics. Even the cinema.? ?
It seems to me that what we initially went through in the postmodern culture was a period of critical democratisation, in which values were free, for all, to be demolished. But as with Marxism, it bred its own gurus and students, the latter rather adulatory with respect to the former. It had substituted one kind of ideological dominance for another. To be sure, Derrida and Barthes, particularly the latter with his notion of ?readerly? and ?writerly? texts (which assumed that no one could be an ?authority?), would not have known that their death would be followed by the usual bantering and bickering which would breed a culture of slavish disciples, but this was anyway the case with all other intellectual figures before them: from religious leaders to Karl Marx. The sad footnote this compels is that when the generation of Barthes and Derrida died, they left virtually nothing for those disciples to improve on. What was the outcome? A sensibility in which everything was rationalised by theories.? ?
Perhaps that?s why this rift between art house movies and mainstream movies worries me so much. Not because I oppose that art house, but because no culture can survive on it alone if there isn?t an alternative, majoritarian, mainstream sector operating elsewhere. Films like Konsthapal Punyasoma make sense not because they are artistically fulfilling (whatever that means), but because we NEED them. They don?t rely, for one thing, on brochures that elaborate on their own workings. (I had to wade through one such brochure to make sense of some of the sequences in Handagama?s Age Asa Aga, a brochure which the director had distributed on the night of the premiere.) Those workings need to be left to be discerned by the audiences. When they aren?t, when there is no proper centre to hold them, and when even the majoritarian movies theatres screen are also devoted to their own workings (like the Ranjan Ramanayake, Bandu Samarasinghe, and Tennyson Cooray vehicles), audiences eventually get tired and decide to shirk those theatres. The postmodern culture is wonderful, but it has left us, or rather our cinema, in a crevice.? ?

Then a lover, now a lecher
	
These ones form the staff of an august assembly, but they do have faults and foibles that are common to the other ordinary mortals too.
?
A fair and lovely one of this place was involved in an affair with a uniformed one wearing an insignia of a high rank and unfortunately for them the cute one?s hubby learnt about this affair and forced her to stay back at home and play the housewife role.
Meanwhile, a high-up of the assembly staff well past his middle age, on hearing that the lovely one was having a tough time at home, a spiteful hubby constantly breathing down her neck, played peace maker and his effort was so successful, the hubby allowed her to go back to work.?
And the lovely one happily began attending work again. But she is no longer happy because, this time round, the elderly high-up who played peace maker has begun making amorous advances to her giving her no peace of mind, they say.?

Thumb ? Symbol of Will Power, Reason and Logic
	
?
For the purpose of delineating the character of a person, eminent palmists have divided the Thumb into six types. The six types are:
(1) The Clubbed Thumb
(2) The Supple-jointed Thumb
(3) The Firm-jointed Thumb
(4) The Waist-like Thumb
(5) The Straight Thumb
(6) The Elementary Thumb
The descriptions and characteristics of the six types the Thumb may overlap some of the details we have given in previous articles on the Thumb. However, the repeat in this article of any detail already given would only contribute to better understanding of the subject.
(1) The Clubbed Thumb:?
This Thumb is thick like a club. People having this type of Thumb are brutal, unreasonable and obstinate. They cannot tolerate any opposition. Their passions are so intense they are ungovernable. They may commit any act of violence including murder. Therefore, this kind of Thumb has always been called the Murderer?s Thumb. The owner of the Clubbed Thumb, however, cannot preplan or premeditate murder for he is incapable of Will Power. The shorter the Thumb, the more brutal the owner is.
(2) The Supple-jointed Thumb:?
This Thumb bends outwards and is supple at the joint underneath the nail the owner of this Thumb is pliable and adaptable. He is broad-minded and can be unconventional. He is very liberal in his outlook. The Head line sloping and bending downwards heighten these characteristics. This Thumb always denotes generosity in regard to both thinking and spending money The Supple-jointed Thumb person is a giver on impulse. But if given time, to think over, he might change his idea to give.
(3) The Firm-jointed Thumb:?
This person on the contrary, may refuse to grant a request on impulse, but on second thought he would decide to grant the request. Once, he has made up his mind, he would not change it. This kind of Thumb represents resisting nature. The longer the first or nailed phalanx, the stronger is the Will Power. These people seldom make friends easily. The nature of these people is such that on a railway journey, they would never make a casual remark to begin a conversation with a fellow passenger. On the contrary, they would start an argument with a fellow passenger over a hardly important matter like keeping a window open or shutting it. However, the Supple-jointed people would readily enter into conversation with a fellow traveler. They are charming and affable companions.
(4) The Waist-like Thumb:?
The owner of this Thumb would not depend on reason or logic to make his point or to win over others. Instead, he would employ tact and diplomacy to gain his end.
(5) The Straight Thumb:
?The owner of this Thumb would not use tact and diplomacy nor would logic and reason to make his point. Instead he would resort to argument straightaway to convince the other party of his point. In the process he may antagonize the people to his own disadvantage.
(6) The Elementary Thumb:
?This is almost shapeless. It has the appearance of a piece of flesh stuck on the hand. This Thumb is coarse and heavy and its owner is an unreasonable bully. He is boorish and clownish even with those as coarse as himself.

We also hurt when President is accused- Abeygunawardena
	
In reference to the negative remarks that have been made by some UNP members recently against President Maithripala Sirisena, MP Rohitha Abeygunawardena said yesterday that they also hurt when such remarks are made against the President.
He told a news conference that as the incumbent President was the Secretary of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) during their regime, they also felt sorry for him and feel hurt themselves when they hear such things being said.?It is evident that the current SLFP members seem to be reluctant to voice their displeasure about the things said about their leader. Without being silent, they should raise their voices on behalf of the President. If such a thing happens to our leader, Mahinda Rajapaksa, we would not react in the way the SLFP members are reacting. We will definitely raise our voices on behalf of our leader,? Abeygunawardena said.
Meanwhile, he said the process of penalising those responsible for the bond scam was slow and laboured and seems to be going slow deliberately.?We urge President Sirisena to take instant action to punish the culprits irrespective of the high positions they enjoy, whether it is within the government or outside it,? Abeygunawardena added. (Sheain Fernandopulle)

Whither women?s empowerment?
	
In countries built exclusively on the rule of law, such things as democracy and equality measures are valid
In Sri Lanka, we have tried to impose democracy on a feudal citizenry
Those who get hammered most are the communities whose sensibilities and systems have been compromised, violated and forcibly broken down without justifiable cause or sufficiently insightful thinking
One fourth of the seats at this edition of the local council elections are set aside for women. The general consensus among people at the news seems to be? ?Good! Finally!?? ?
While I laud their enthusiasm I must smile into my collar. I am going to tell you a tale that should give you some idea why I am amused. This is a story of that which is casual, commonplace. A story based on the application of human psychology and traditional sociology that I was fortunate enough to stumble upon during a decade spent traipsing around the country observing its ways and wiles, its means and methods, its systems and strategies.??
As we know, local councils, village committees and other such village level governance bodies are, to this day, saturated with men. In most, men made up the entire body. I used to casually wonder about the role of women in the charting of their own lives and in helping chart the lives of their communities in such a lopsided system of local government. That was, until I met a middle aged woman on the east coast just after the tsunami. It was a time when they were trying to rebuild their lives and reallocate common resources to speed up recovery. Since I do not have consent to use her name let us call her Kalya. I was trying to get a participatory rural assessment done and in our discussions, the issue of the lack of women in governance came up.??
She smiled and said ?Don?t worry about us. We have our methods?. I sat up. Instantly alert.? ?
?Take this case now?? she continued. ?Three days from now, our committee will meet. At this meeting they will decide whether a two-acre plot set aside for agriculture is going to be given to Shivasubramaniam or Ragunathan. Now, Ragu is a wheeler dealer and we knew he probably had our committee in his pocket. Shiva is a good farmer. When we women met at the well yesterday, including the wives of the committee members, we decided that we will not let Ragu have his way. Then we went home. Then the wives of the all-powerful committee told their respective husbands that they have a choice. They can either allocate the land to Shiva or they do not have to bother themselves angling with their wives for a bed game for the next three months?.? ?
I must have at least blinked twice if not looked downright skeptical because she laughed and said ?We met again today at the well and the overwhelming vote of the men was ?yes dear?, ?of course darling?, ?definitely love??. A week later Kalya casually mentioned to me that Shiva had got the land with a 100% vote in his favour. She also mentioned in quiet satisfaction that an ineffectual Raghu was foaming at the mouth, unable to figure out what had gone wrong.? ?
Then she said something that I refuse to forget: ?We are good. We know what we are doing. Men are dumb. They engage in power politics. We are smart. We engage in pillow politics. Much more effective?.
Those segregated rights cannot be effectively ensured in a country such as ours that lacks those four institutional fundamentals
I asked her if this was the case everywhere and she flashed back ?Everywhere that women are not given a few seats on a committee or a council.??
Slightly angry she went on ?You see, the minute we get three or four seats on a committee of eleven, our men our empowered. Not our women?.? ?
I must have looked confused because she hastened to explain. ?See, the great idiots of government believe they are doing us a favor because they have a mad idea that we are then part of the decision making process by being on the committees. The opposite happens. We are outshouted and outvoted because men are in the majority and pillow politics are no longer viable. If we try it under those circumstances, they simply turn around and tell us that we are now on the committee and that if we lose in committee votes we cannot hold that against them. To get things done the way women want things done, it is far better not to be in a minority in a democratic committee. It simply disempowers us. It is a foolish system. Instead of being part of the decision making process, the system makes sure we can never be a part of it?. True! Yikes!??
In countries built exclusively on the rule of law, such things as democracy and equality measures are valid. In those countries, four things work together to give everyone a fair shot at ownership of well-being, state building and development. Those are a) constitutional guarantees, b) access to legal relief, c) access to social institutions and d) trust in enforcement agencies. Let?s face it folks. Sri Lanka doesn?t have any of those available to the average citizen. They must rely on leveraging organically created social dynamics and societal torques to feel that they belong and that they are safe, secure, happy and can get things done. For many rural communities, these come from community stratagems. They do not come from women?s rights, youth rights, child rights or human rights. Those segregated rights cannot be effectively ensured in a country such as ours that lacks those four institutional fundamentals. Therefore, in the process of trying, with the best of intentions, to enforce segregated rights approaches, all that happens is that the community breaks apart at its seams and becomes essentially dysfunctional. Quite apart from making people feel secure, it makes them feel vulnerable.? ?
In Sri Lanka, we have tried to impose democracy on a feudal citizenry. On one side this has resulted in a confused society and on the other, as we have seen a national disaster of epic proportions in our decades long experiment with democracy. In the end, those who get hammered most are the communities whose sensibilities and systems have been compromised, violated and forcibly broken down without justifiable cause or sufficiently insightful thinking. If rights are so bloody important, then, we had better understand that the only right worth recognizing and protecting is the right of a community to decide how it will ensure its own societal equity. Statespersons should look very closely at those and then decide how they are going to create their laws accordingly. They must figure out how they can factor in community methods of assuring equity into the legislative mishmash.? ?
?
We met again today at the well and the overwhelming vote of the men was ?yes dear?, ?of course darling?, ?definitely love
?
But how? No one has heard of such nonsense as ?community rights?, right? That is because those types of rights are inconvenient to a reductionist world which has brought itself to its knees by insisting that one size fits all. In our systemic idea of the planet, we have picked up an import known as democracy and have tried to flog that to our people regardless of its viability or its capability to help, solve or strengthen our society. Such is the extent to which we have blindly bought into this that in many urban communities, we believe that democracy is truth regardless of the barrel full of evidence pointing to its executive disaster. If our women were to know better, they should be very wary of the casually perceived gains of having a minority presence on enacted bodies, put those in the balance with existing strengths and see which end tips up. Kalya would tell you that there are many ways to skin a cat and that the democratic knife is probably the dullest and most useless tool of them all.? ? ?

Will leave after punishing corrupt politicians: President
	
President Maithripala Sirisena yesterday said he would leave the presidency after giving appropriate punishments to corrupt politicians.
?Some people ask as to when I will resign from the office of President. I will leave the presidency after giving appropriate punishments to corrupt politicians,? the President said addressing a public rally held in Kosgama.
President Sirisena emphasized that he is ready to walk down in the streets with the people to commence a journey against the fraud and corruption.
?After the local government elections held on February 10, a national movement against the corruption will be established joining hands with all the politicians who love the motherland irrespective of their political differences,? he said.
He extended an invitation to all citizens who love the motherland to join him in this initiative.
Addressing the gathering, the President further said that by no means the work that has to be done for the betterment of the country and the nation, could be neglected.
Recalling the request made by former leaders to the people of this country, to rectify the mistake happened on January 08, 2015, the President questioned whether they are asked to re-create an era where disappearances, killings, murders of journalists and setting fire to media institutions occur.

Wonders of the Microbe World
	
?
By? Jayani Rathnayake??
Did you know that bacteria also celebrates seasonality changes as other living organisms in modern hierarchy? Much like the weather, some human stomachs change throughout the year. The gut bacterial fluctuations, at first time, has been found by Dr Sonnenburg and his colleagues, a microbiologist at Stanford University and lead author of the new study.? ?
In Tanzania, not far from the Serengeti, live the Hadza, a community of about 1,300 people. For such a small group, they attract a lot of scientific attention. Dr. Sonnenburg found that microbiota of these people reflects the seasonal availability of different types of food. Between seasons striking differences were observed in their gut microbial communities, with some taxa are suddenly disappearing only to reappear when the seasons turned. Further comparison with Hadza microbiota with that of diverse urbanized people revealed distinctly different patterns of microbiota community composition. Many gut bacteria that wax and wane drastically are rare in people living in industrialized societies. They discovered that the Hadza microbiome is seasonal, changing in a cycle throughout the year. Diversity peaks in the dry season, when Prevotella species become particularly abundant and the bacteria that showed the greatest annual fluctuations generally tended to be strains not present in the gut of people with Western lifestyles. These annual changes in the gut microbiome are probably caused by cyclical shifts in the Hadza diet. During Tanzania?s dry season, the Hadza eat a lot of meat plus tubers and fruit from the baobab tree, but in the wet season they eat more honey and berries. Prevotella species are particularly good at breaking down plant material, so may be particularly useful during the dry season.? ?
In 2013, Stephanie Schnorr, then a graduate student at the Max Planck Institute for Evo lutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany, began the first study of the Hadza microbiome. She collected a series of stool samples. Dr. Schnorr eventually extracted DNA from microbes within 27 Hadza and compared them with samples gathered from people in Bologna, Italy. In 2014, she and her colleagues reported some striking differences. The Hadza hosted a much greater diversity of gut microbial species than did the Italians, the researchers found, and there were some fundamental differences in species they carried. Some that were common in the Hadza were rare or missing from Italians.Some samples were collected during Tanzania?s dry season and others during the wet season. Dr. Sonnenburg oversaw an analysis of those samples from 188 of the Hadza. In the new study, published in the journal Science, he and his colleagues reported sharp fluctuations in composition of the gut bacteria. Some species were more common in one season than the other,some simply disappeared altogether. A comparison of these samples with those taken by Dr. Schnorr confirmed the fluctuations to be a regular cycle.? ?
?In terms of the structure that has to be done to see whether the Hadza microbiome, we can say we have a transplanting bacteria? Dr. Schnorr said. But the discovery of a seasonal cycle is new for any human microbiome. Researchers already knew that the composition of gut bacteria can shift quickly. ?An abrupt change in diet will lead to an abrupt change in the gut microbiome, in the order of a day or two,? Dr. Sonnenberg said. In the new study, Dr. Sonnenburg and his colleagues also compared the Hadza microbiome with those of people in 17 other societies, including urban Americans ? and Yanomamo villagers in the Amazon rain forest.The Hadza microbiome is most similar to those in traditional societies, and least to the industrialized ones. The researchers found that the species that set the Hadza apart from industrial societies the most are also the ones that are the most seasonal.? ?
It has been proven that the study sheds light on how the seasonal availability of plants and animals might have influenced the gut microbes of our ancient human ancestors, who would have hunted and gathered in a similar fashion to the Hadza. Knowing this could help researchers understand where ancestral humans lived and foraged, as well as which nutrients were available to them. It also suggests the human evolved in a ?bio rhythm? in sync with natural food cycles, moreover, that industrialized people?s microbiomes could be out of sync with that cycle. There are not yet enough data to determine how that affects our gut health, ? though, they said. It is thought that certain health problems may arise because our bodies may not be well adapted to the microbiomes associated with Western diets and lifestyles.? ?
