CEB to buy power from ACE
	
The Ceylon Electricity Board today said it had decided to connect 100 MW to the national grid from the ACE Power Generation of Embilipitiya, which had been shut down due to the non renewal of tariff revisions.
?Earlier the CEB had decided to shut down the ACE Power Generation in Matara and Embilipitiya (a subsidiary of Aitken Spence PLC), which provided 20 MW and 100 MW due to non-renewal of the tariff revisions as well as the Heladhanavi Power Station in Puttalam,? CEB Media Spokesman Sulakshan Jayawardena said.
?The decision was taken to purchase electricity as an immediate precaution due to several blackouts that occurred recently and to provide uninterrupted power,? he said.
Meanwhile he said power generators were being placed across ten different locations in Colombo as well.
?Two generators of 2.5 KW and eight Generators of 11 KW are being used for the purpose. Those generators would be connected to the national grid, when there is a demand. The hydro power generation had increased by 40 per cent as a result of the showers experienced during the last few days,? he said.
Earlier the CEB said that the additional electricity that was required, would obtained from other thermal power plants including from the one at Norochcholai and Kerawalapitiya.
?The country's daily electricity demand now stands at 2,300 MW,? he said. (Chaturanga Pradeep)

Defence Secretary unsuitable for post: Wimal
	
National Freedom Front (NFF) Leader MP Wimal Weerawansa today urged the Government to refrain from underestimating the national security, while claiming Defence Secretary Karunasena Hettiarachchi proved to be unsuitable for the post by the day.
Addressing a media briefing MP Weerawansa said the recovery of a suicide kit and explosives in Vallakulam, Chavakachcheri was not an ordinary incident, even though the Defence Secretary had referred to it as finding some items that were used during the war time.
?Sri Lanka would have been in a huge danger if such a Defence Secretary had been in power at the war period because he interpreted this incident not as a threat to the national security,? he added.
He said there had been pressure to the Police not to reveal such discoveries even though such incidents had happened in the past for several times. He was thankful to the Police officers who revealed this despite of such a situation.
??It is easy to decide whether these explosives are from post war period by the newspaper sheets which used to wrap them. One of those parcels was labeled as ?Wellawatte?. There were also five SIM cards,? he added.
He said the all the people would have to face the danger, despite of who vote for the Government and not, if they risk the national security. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)

Explosive detection; GL must be quizzed over his statement-Govt
	
Cabinet spokesman and Minister Gayantha Karunatilaka today said Prof. G.L Peiris must be questioned over the utterances he had made to the media about alleged plans to bring the suicide jacket and explosives detected from a house at Chavakachcheri to Wellawatte.
Minister Karunatilaka told the weekly cabinet news briefing that Prof. Peiris apparently had vital information on this detection in advance and therefore, it was necessary to extract more information from him which would help the ongoing investigation on the detection.
Prof. Peiris on Wednesday told the media that the government was looking away while national security was under threat.
Defence Secretary Karunasena Hettiarachchi said the detection of a suicide jacket, explosives hand grenades and bullets was not a threat to national security as this kind of detections are made by the police and armed forces regularly.
However, Mr. Hettiarachchi regretted attempts by certain politicians and a section of the media?s to portray it as a sign of re-emergence of separatist terrorism and a threat to the national security. (Sandun A Jayasekera)

Amidst the intensifying competition for the post of IGP, outgoing Police Chief N.K. Illangakoon yesterday said that he had never gone behind others asking for the IGP post.
He said in his 34 years in service, even when he was holding second position in the Police, had never gone after promotions or benefits and that those things came to him at the right time as he worked according to his conscience.
?Even when I was the second in command of the police force, holding the rank of Senior DIG Administration, I never expected to become the IGP one day. Because of this quality, I have never been sidelined within the Department,? he said at an event held at the Criminal Record Division Auditorium.
He said that he had no other expectations throughout his career except for carrying out his duties according to his heart.

India has enough ammunition to stop WI: Sanga
	
Kumar Sangakkara in an exclusive chat with the NDTV said that Indian cricket skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni has enough ammunition in his repertoire to stop Chris Gayle, when India face West Indies in the World T20 semifinal in Mumbai today.
"I think India has quite a few options to stop Chris Gayle. They have Jasprit Bumrah, who bowls with decent pace and with an unorthodox action.
"At the same time, they have Ravichandran Ashwin and Suresh Raina. I feel Dhoni will turn to Ashwin to open against Gayle, and sacrifice two to three overs to try and get rid of the big West Indian," Sangakkara told in an exclusive chat with NDTV.
"Gayle has also shown particular weakness against left-armers. India has Ashish Nehra, who is bowling beautifully throughout the tournament. So, Dhoni has enough options," he added.
Virat Kohli who has been in phenomenal form in the tournament, could well again be West Indies' nemesis, opined Sangakkara.
"Teams have been wary of Kohli in this tournament. Teams have tried various options to get him out, but none of them have worked. You saw Australians, in my view, bowling a bit too straight to Virat, which he flicked through the leg side for a boundary," Sangkkara said.
"Then they bowled a wide, which Kohli drove for four through point. So, the bowlers seemed to be under pressure and thereby bowling to Virat's zones. West Indies' bowling line-up is not one of the strongest in the tournament. So, their management must be working to find a way out to get him out," he added.

Joint opp. cries foul over FCID in Geneva
	
The three joint opposition MPs who went to Geneva have handed over a letter to the Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU) General Secretary today and complained about the Financial Crime Investigation Division (FCID) among other allegations of injustice caused towards them by the Government.
Joint opposition Organiser MP Dullas Alahapperuma and MPs Bandula Gunawardane and Udaya Gammanpila left for Switzerland on Wednesday to take part in a meeting with IPU General Secretary Martin Chungong.
They met the General Secretary today and handed over the letter in which they highlighted seven key factors including a complaint on the FCID.
?The FICD was established violating the Criminal Procedure Code and the Police Ordinance. It is a thinly veiled political device functioning under the aegis of the Prime Minister and making allegations to suppress the joint opposition. Already 29 MPs had been interrogated by the FCID. One of the motives behind this is to pressurize joint opposition MPs to join the Government,? the letter signed by nine MPs said.
Abuse of rights and privileges of the joint opposition MPs, neglecting them when appointing Opposition Leader, Chief Opposition Whip, not providing enough representation at Parliamentary Committees, violation of basic parliamentary principles and denial of privileges of constituent party leaders were among the key matters taken up with the IPU by the MPs.
They have also complained that the Government was dismissing answers to important questions to humiliate the joint opposition and taking months to respond to questions requiring prompt answers.
?The impact of these matters will damage the democratic values and traditions of Sri Lanka. Our view is that the assignment of Parliamentary time and composition of its committees should be based on numerical strength of respective political parties. We earnestly request the IPU to urge relevant Sri Lankan authorities to correct this deplorable situation immediately,? the MPs told the IPU General Secretary. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

Namal alleges PM hiring private firm
	
UPFA MP Namal Rajapaksa recently alleged that Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe was hiring a private consultant firm based in Hong Kong, to organise his upcoming official visit to China.
Tweeting on Saturday, the MP questioned as to why a private consultant was hired to attend to the needs of the official visit, instead of the Foreign Affairs Ministry.
He said the alleged stance was in a bid to restore and bolster the Sri Lanka-China friendship.
?The Premier expects to revive the bankrupt economy of Sri Lanka from the visit. It was he, as the Opposition Leader, who once accused Chinese establishments of being crooks and Mahinda Rajapaksa of stealing funds borrowed from them. The Prime Minister should reveal the true reason of hiring a private firm and also the sum they have spent to receive their service,? he said.
With an undercurrent of sarcasm, the MP further questioned the level of competence of the Foreign Affairs Ministry officials and other envoys. (Lahiru Pothmulla)
			Consultancy for technical concerns only ? Harsha
			Refuting the claims and allegations made by MP Namal Rajapaksa that the Hong Kong based private consultant firm was hired to facilitate the Prime Minister?s visit to China, and to patch-up the relationship between the two sides, the Foreign Affairs Ministry yesterday said the entire visit was organised by the government.
			Deputy Foreign Affairs Minister Dr. Harsha de Silva told the Daily Mirror that the Premier?s tour was handled by the Government of Sri Lanka (GoSL), and that the firm was hired only to seek technical and political assistance in China.
			?The arrangements for the visit are being done by the Prime Minister?s Office together with the Foreign Affairs Ministry. We have not outsourced the organising to anyone else. The consultation is specific and short-term, and there is nothing wrong with it.
			These types of consultations happen all the time. We can do consultations anywhere we wish to. The consultant is very close to the political and business leadership of China,? he said.
			Commenting on making groundwork for the visit, the Deputy Minister stated that the GoSL had bolstered the Sri Lankan Mission in Beijing to facilitate the visit and added that Ambassador Dr. Karunasena Kodithuwakku was already making necessary arrangements.
			?Senior career diplomats have been sent to China to attend to necessary arrangements on the visit. Ministers Malik Samarawickrama and Sagala Ratnayake were already in China couple of weeks ago. The Foreign Affairs Ministry is doing all what needs to be done,? he said.
			Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe is to visit China in the first week of April. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

PM vows to look into concerns of biz sector
	
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe today said he will look into the concerns raised by certain groups in the business circle with regard to non tariff barriers that Sri Lankan exporters face when they enter the Indian market.
?There are non tariff barriers which Sri Lankan exporters have to face when their goods enter the Indian market. There is red tape in India brought on by the administration set up of that country. We are especially focusing on it. There is no such red tape for Indian goods entering the Sri Lankan market,? Mr. Wickremesinghe said while addressing a gathering at UNP head quarters Sirikotha last morning.
? We are going to focus on these non tariff barriers when discussing the proposed Economic and Technological Cooperation Agreement (ETCA) with India. The Indians do not face such non tariff barriers when they enter the Sri Lankan market. We will ensure that both Sri Lankan and Indian exporters have a level playing field,? the Prime Minister said.
Elaborating on ETCA , Mr, Wickremesinghe said the government had informed India that the professional services exchange programme could not be included in the agreement.
He said the government would put the frame work agreement in Parliament soon. He said everyone would have access to it through the House. ?The President has also instructed that trade agreements should be discussed openly. This will be done through Parliament. There is no other democratic methodology. We are committed to carry out such a democratic process,? he said.
"What amazes me are those from the Bamunu Kulaya who sas the government should talk with them. We will go straight to Parliament to discuss trade pacts as per the mandate given by the people. These people who make demands are those who glorified Rajapaksas . We can determine who is a Bamuna and who is wasalaya through the Wasala Suthra preached by the Buddha. The media is publishing various reports. Some reports say those who have been appointed to discuss trade pacts are not qualified. We have appointed Prof. Saman Kelegama for the job. They can find out who he is and should not ask me. The right hand of some journalists does not know what their left hand is writing. Some glorify Rajapaksas and others go behind Prof.G L Peiris. What doe he know about the economy?," Premier Wickremesinghe said.
He said the government would set the stage for the creation of one million jobs in the coming months. ?We are also making an effort to ensure a sound economic and social status for the people of this country. We pledged to create one million jobs. We are totally focusing on it,? he said adding that it would be fulfilled through trade agreements with China, India, USA, Singapore and Europe.
?We will go for a joint economic programme with China and also go for an economic agreement. We will also work with Japan, will sign a trade pact with Singapore, restore GSP plus and get the ban of fish exports lifted. We hope these will be done before the end of this year,? he said.
?One million jobs will be created through investments of these countries. ? Do not have doubts about it as we will definitely achieve the target,? he added. (Yohan Perera and Chaturanga Pradeep)
