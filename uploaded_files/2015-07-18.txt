COPE committee members to go to court
	
Former UPFA MP Bandula Gunawardane said today COPE committee members had decided to explain their position to the court regarding the enjoining order which prevented the publication or circulation of the COPE subcommittee draft report on the sale of Central Bank bonds.
Mr. Gunawardane told a news conference that COPE committee members Susil Premajayantha, Lasantha Alagiyawanna, Sunil Hadunneththi and Weerakumara Disanayake are among the members who were prepared to go to courts.
He said they had also decided to issue a book which consists of special speeches made in parliament regarding the Bond issue.
?We will issue a book based on special statements made in parliament regarding the bond issue. Publication of the COPE report can be prevented but they cannot stop the publication of the speeches in the Hansard. Then people will realise what has really happened,? Mr. Gunawardane said.
Former UNP MP Tissa Attanayake said there had been an increase in the cases of international intervention in domestic affairs under the new government and added that even the general election was announced due to international pressure.
?President Maithripala Sirisena had assured US Secretary of State John Kerry and United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-moon that the general election will be held in September. He is acting not according to the needs of the people but to satisfy the international community,? he said. (Ajith Siriwardana)

Indian police to block Indo-Lanka drug trafficking
	
The Indian Police have constituted a special squad called the D-Team, to mount surveillance on drug traffickers and contain the smuggling activities after witnessing a spurt in smuggling of drugs between Sri Lanka and India via sea route.
Announcing the formation of the special team on Friday, Superintendent of Police N.M. Mylvahanan said in Ramanathapuram that the five-member team, headed by a Sub Inspector of Police, would work round the clock, collecting intelligence on drug trafficking after mounting surveillance on drug traffickers, who had been arrested in last three years in the district.
The D-Team formed on the lines of C Branch to deal with crime offenders would monitor the movements of the drug traffickers and function directly under the control of Special Branch police, which, in turn, would come under his direct control, the SP said.
As the smugglers used the islets in the Gulf of Mannar region as transit points before they smuggled the contraband to Sri Lanka, it has been decided to launch joint inspections in the islets in coordination with the Forest department, Coastal Security Group, Q branch and Fisheries department, the SP said.
The coastal security meeting, chaired by Collector K. Nanthakumar on Tuesday decided to launch the inspections next week, the SP said and urged the general public to alert the police about the smuggling activities by calling the ?Hello Police? at 83000 31100?.
The details of the callers would be kept secret and those who provide vital information would be rewarded, the SP said.
The formation of ?D-Team? assumed significance as the district police had registered 24 drug trafficking cases during the last six months and arrested 36 smugglers, police said.
After the coastal Mandapam, Verkodu, Thriupullani and Uthirakosamangai check-posts were alerted, there has been considerable reduction in smuggling of drugs through the sea route to the sea shores, the SP said.
After alerting the check-posts, the police had last month impounded a lorry, used for smuggling ganja in Erwadi, police added. (The Hindu)

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on Friday signed a Special Currency Swap Agreement with the Central Bank of Sri Lanka. Under the arrangement, the Central Bank of Sri Lanka can draw up to $1.1 billion for a maximum period of six months.
The proposal to extend the additional currency swap facility of $1.1 billion for a limited period was decided by the Union Government in April 2015 based on the recommendation of the Reserve Bank of India for mitigating the possible currency volatility in the spirit of strengthening India?s bilateral relations and economic ties with Sri Lanka.
This special arrangement is in addition to the existing Framework on Currency Swap Arrangement for the SAARC (South Asian Association for Regional Co-operation) Member Countries. SAARC has eight member countries ? Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka.
On March 25, 2015, the Reserve Bank of India had signed a Currency Swap Agreement with the Central Bank of Sri Lanka for $400 million under the existing SAARC Currency Swap Framework within the overall limit of USD 2 billion.
The swap arrangements are intended to provide a backstop line of funding for the SAARC member countries to meet any balance of payments and liquidity crises till longer term arrangements are made or if there is need for short-term liquidity due to stressed market conditions.(The Hindu)

Sri Lanka now seeks to expand cooperation with the international community including through new partnerships with donor agencies, such as U.S. Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) to provide a tangible peace dividend to its people, the Sri Lankan government said.
In a meeting with the Chief Executive Officer of the U.S. Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) Dana J. Hyde, Sri Lanka?s Ambassador Prasad Kariyawasam emphasized the desire of the Government to establish a partnership with the United States under the Millennium Challenge Corporation, the embassy said in a statement.
Created by the U.S. Congress in January 2004, with strong bipartisan support, MCC is an innovative foreign aid agency that operates on the principle of delivering U.S. grant assistance to select countries on the basis of a long-term consultative partnership, with the objective of reducing global poverty through sustainable economic growth.
MCC grants to partner countries can reach the tune of US$ 500 million over a five-year partnership. To date, MCC has approved over $10 billion in assistance worldwide that support country-determined projects in such sectors as agriculture and irrigation, infrastructure, water supply and sanitation, access to health, finance and enterprise development, anti-corruption initiatives, land rights and access to education. MCC selects eligible countries based on their performance in the areas of good governance, economic freedom and investment in their citizens.
Ambassador Kariyawasam briefed Ms. Hyde on the reform process in Sri Lanka and the significant progress that has been achieved by the government since its election to office in January. Sri Lanka now seeks to expand cooperation with the international community including through new partnerships with donor agencies, such as MCC to provide a tangible peace dividend to its people. Acknowledging the progressive developments taking place in Sri Lanka, Ms. Hyde said that MCC was encouraged by the reform process and would continue to closely follow developments in the coming months. She invited the Ambassador to continue interaction with MCC.

The United National Front for Good Governance (UNFGG) will not allow anyone to push President Maithripala Sirisena out of his good governance policies, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said yesterday.
Addressing an election rally in Karandeniya, Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said ?We will not allow anyone to push President Maithripala Sirisena?s vehicle of good governance out of track and the days in which only the well being of one?s family instead of the country is gone now?.

The Premier reiterated that a future UNFGG government would implement a mega economic development plan that would provide employment for the younger generation.
He also said the tea industry would have a prosperous period with the possible peace treaty between Iran and USA as Sri Lankan tea would find its way into the Iranian market.
