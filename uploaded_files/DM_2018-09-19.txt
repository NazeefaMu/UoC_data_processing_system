JO wants Police Commission members to resign
	
The Joint Opposition (JO) today urged the Commissioners of the National Police Commission (NPC) to resign if they could not properly investigate the alleged conspiracy to assassinate President Maithripala Sirisena and former Defence Secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa.
JO MP Dullas Alahapperuma told a news conference that IGP Pujith Jayasundera should take immediate measures to arrest DIG Nalaka de Silva, who MP Alahapperuma said was the mastermind of the alleged conspiracy.
We are aware that there are talented and credible officers at the NPC. Even if they cannot conduct these investigations in a proper manner, it is better for them to resign to uphold their reputation, he said.
He said the recent transfer of DIG Silva to the IT Division from the Terrorism Investigation Division (TID) was also dubious.
These authorities are attempting to erase the data of the telephone conversations between DIG Silva and Mr Namal Kumara, who made the revelation, MP Alahapperuma said.
Alahapperuma also said though the Law and Order Ministry had guaranteed to provide security for President Sirisena after the alleged conspiracy coming to light, no such security had been provided for Mr Rajapaksa despite him already having a smaller security detail.
Meanwhile, Pivithuru Hela Urumaya (PHU) MP Udaya Gammanpila said IGP Jayasundera was not following the instructions of the NPC on the alleged conspiracy, though he was bound to follow them. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)

Malaysia arrests ex-PM Razak over USD 628mn scandal
	
Malaysia's anti-graft agency said it arrested former Prime Minister Najib Razak today over the multimillion-dollar looting of a state investment fund and that he will face further charges in court, the Economic Times reported.
The agency said former Prime Minister Najib was detained at its office and will be taken to court on Thursday to face the charges.
He was earlier charged with multiple counts of criminal breach of trust, corruption and money laundering over the scandal at the 1MDB state fund. He has pleaded not guilty.
Those charges involve the transfer of 42 million ringgit ($10.3 million) into his bank accounts from SRC International; a former unit of the 1MDB fund that international investigators say was looted of billions by his associates.
He set up 1MDB when he took power in 2009 for the stated purpose of promoting economic development, but the fund amassed billions in debts and is being investigated in the US and several other countries for alleged cross-border embezzlement and money laundering.
After leaked documents exposed the scandal, he sacked critics in his government, muzzled the media and quashed investigations. Public anger led to the defeat of his long-ruling coalition in May 9 elections and ushered in the first change of power since Malaysia gained independence from Britain in 1957.
The new government reopened the investigations stifled under former Prime Minister Najib's rule and barred him and his wife from leaving the country. Police also seized jewelry and valuables valued at more than 1.1 billion ringgit ($270.2 million) from properties linked to him.

Mending Walls Instead Mending Fences: The political context of Reconciliation
	
Something there is that doesnt love a wall,
That sends the frozen-ground-swell under it,
And spills the upper boulders in the sun;
And makes gaps even two can pass abreast.
- Robert Frost (Mending Wall)

Kanepahara (lit. A Box on the ears) is the title of a series of radio dramas scheduled to be broadcast over the government owned Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation (SLBC) for the promotion of so-called post-war reconciliation among communities. The serial dramas have been produced under the auspices of the Office for National Unity and Reconciliation (ONUR), itself a government body headed by Chandrika Kumaratunga, a former president, who played a main role in toppling her bte noire Mahinda Rajapaksas government in 2015. The broadcast of the drama series is reported to be currently in suspension due to the intervention of the minister responsible (Wijedasa Rajapakshe) amidst an eruption of vocal protests by several Buddhist monks and lay Buddhists against the titles of some of the episodes lined up for broadcast for being allegedly disrespectful of Buddhism. What this writer feels, after following news about the matter via online sources, is that the ONUR probably wants to educate, through these plays, the rural listeners of the country who, they arbitrarily believe, are backward Buddhists, to think in unconventional ways so that they become more amenable to the Yahapalanayas alleged reconciliation process; however, its drama project is more likely to be an oblique scurrilous attack on the Sinhalese Buddhist majority who insist on safeguarding the age old Buddhist cultural foundation on which the Sri Lankan state still stands. It is this cultural foundation reinforced by many centuries of peaceful coexistence with the largest minority the predominantly Hindu Tamils, and the good neighbourly mainstream Muslims and Christians that always ensures communal harmony. There has been a groundswell of fresh awareness of the importance of replenishing customary inter-communal relations since the conclusion of separatist disturbances in 2009 for establishing a happy, secure, stable society. It is yet to be seen whether Kanepahara is compatible with this trend or not. 
The monks and lay Buddhists who so vehemently criticize the lewd language of the titles do not prejudge the plays as lacking in artistic merit simply on that account. Neither does the present writer. These comments, like theirs, focus the sponsor of the plays, the ONUR and its probable motives. No criticism of the plays as works of art is intended. When this writer first read about the controversy and watched a video of the monks protest speeches (August 22, 2018), he was sceptical about the rationality of those protests. One reason for this was the fact that a group of very respectable, in fact, the most highly celebrated artistes available in the field in his opinion (such as Iranganie Serasinghe, Jayalath Manorathne, Wijerathne Warakagoda, Lakshman Wijesekera, Buddhadasa Vithanachchi, and Mahendra Perera, et al) had participated in the making of the radio plays: they had done the voice over. They wouldnt have kept quiet if there was anything outrageously improper in the conversations they were required to utter. Of course, as professionals, they might have just followed directions. 

The broadcast of the drama series is reported to be currently in suspension due to the intervention of the minister responsible

In any case, drama is literature. In literature, even moral messages may be couched in phraseology normally considered immoral for creating a particular effect, without subverting their original meaning, while interpreting them in a truthful unconventional way. This writer remembers how some very prominent Buddhist prelates during the premiership of Sirimavo Bandaranaike (1970-77) bitterly attacked a novel written by that doyen of Sinhala literature and culture Martin Wickremasinghe by the name of Bhavatharanaya or Crossing (the Ocean of) Existence, where he was accused of insulting the Buddha by misrepresenting his character. The monks agitated for the banning of the book, if my memory is correct. The wise Ms. Bandaranaike, a true Buddhist leader and ruler, patiently listened to their protests, and did what had to be done: she got a competent official to read the novel and advise her whether the book deserved to be banned. The person did accordingly, and told her that there was nothing in the book that justified a ban. That was the end of the problem, as far as this writer can remember. He also remembers that when Stanley Tambiah published his Buddhism Betrayed in 1992 (pl. see below), there was an even more strident outcry against it calling for a ban on it in Sri Lanka. The present writer, hearing about this from abroad, genuinely regretted that meaningless demand, for he felt that the publication of the book created a good opportunity for a patriotic Sri Lankan scholar, if possible, to authoritatively counter its suspected anti-Sinhalese Buddhist propagandist ideas. 
Kanepahara too, perhaps, contains its own rebuttal, if it is that bad. After all, even if it turns out to be an attack on the traditional practices of Buddhists, there is no problem. There is a chance that the criticisms are valid, and could point towards essential reform. However, since there are learned monks to point these out, radio listeners need not worry about that. What they should worry about or should be reminded to worry about is the real political motive behind the drama serial, and to be aware enough not to be misled by the plays if their messages are subversive and harmful to them as a nation. 
To return to the subject at hand after this necessary digression, it is well known now that there is a quasi, religio-politically motivated movement (with global ramifications) whose ultimate goal is to destroy the Sinhalese Buddhist cultural base of the country, the associated history, and the indissoluble bond between the Sinhala people and their historic island homeland. This is becoming evident everyday to the discerning public. The nonchalant anti-Buddhist irreligiousness of the play titles, while raising a smokescreen that conceals more serious mobilizations going on against the Sri Lankan state, accidentally betrays ONURs probable empathy with that global campaign (which seems to be aimed at extirpating the Buddhist cultural roots of the majority community the Sinhalese, thereby draining the lifeblood out of the veins of their national identity, and at finally disintegrating the unitary state). 


What transpired in media reports suggested how the government and the main opposition each sought to exonerate itself from its obligation to do something about what looked like a flagrant lack of respect or regard for Buddhist cultural sensitivities shown by the ONUR. The fact that the drama series has been collectively named Kanepaharais probably meant to be a slap in face of the Sinhalese Buddhist majority. However, such superficial perceptions that are easily provoked could deflect peoples attention from the real issues hinted at in the foregoing paragraph. The erudite monks and others who are getting involved in the ultimately vacuous blasphemy allegation (the idea of blasphemy is alien to Buddhism, in any case) had better investigate whether Kanepahara could be seen as a cultural Trojan Horse bought at own expense, if it happens to be seen in a positive light. 
It was Ven. Omalpe Sobhita Thera, one of the stalwarts behind the regime change of 2015, who was probably the first to censure the titles of some of the plays. He took umbrage at perceived attempts at disgracing Buddhism through these plays with titles such as Taruwan Saranai (May (Film) Stars Protect You), Nihon Saepa laebewa(May You gain the Happiness of Japan), and Nirwastram Paramam Sukhang(Nudity is the Highest Happiness). These titles are irreverent parodies of some formulaic Buddhist expressions in common use, which correspond respectively, to Teruwan Saranai(May the Triple Gem Protect You), Nivan Saepa Laebewa (May You Attain Nibbana) and Nibbanam Paramam Sukhang (Nibbana is the supreme bliss). Absurd imitations of what are considered to be inviolable by Buddhists are deeply offensive to Buddhist sentiments. (The arbitrary English translations of the Sinhala titles of the three plays are the present writers.) 
Ven. Omalpe Sobhithas (erstwhile) allies in the Jathika Hela Urumaya have adopted a less censorious line. A statement issued by the JHU suggests that they apparently have no problem with the content of the plays, which they seem to consider revolutionary; yet they object to the titles as being offensive to Buddhist sentiments. They have offered the following three alternative names to the three given above: respectively, Tharu Hamba Paeradunemi (Lured to Ruin by Film Stars), Sakura Ratin Paniwidayak(Letter from Japan), and Helu Saepa soya (All for Lust), which have here been freely rendered into English as given in parentheses. Their statement ends with the aphoristic line: Learn to be revolutionary. Be revolutionary to learn! The JVP has also come out in favour of the ONURs Kanepahara drama series. 
In the opinion of the present writer, it is the political context in which this dramatic confrontation between two organs of the government (the ONUR and the ministry involved) is being played out that should engage the attention of the people. As a member of the older generation of Sri Lankans, who is fairly au fait with the tumultuous history of post independence politics in the island nation at least since 1970, the present writer is perceptive enough to realize that a storm is currently brewing in its political firmament with a pall of darkness hanging over the country. In this highly volatile situation, an emotionally charged pre-broadcast controversy was triggered by the alleged profanity of the titles of some of the plays. The nearly simultaneous publication of a novel with a title that is considered even more sacrilegious (Budunge Rasthiyaduwa which, in English, would be Buddhas Time Killing/Buddha, the Time Killer) added fuel to the flames of downright denunciation of the authors and the anti-Buddhist forces suspected to be behind them. 
In the absence of the scripts of the relevant plays for this writer to examine, their ostensible overall purpose may be guessed from the official remit of the ONUR: bringing allegedly estranged communities together and getting them to mend fences with one another. But the indications are that the plays are more likely to contribute to the opposite process of mending walls between communities as is actually happening at present. What could be the connection between this purpose and the plays which have been given such outrageous titles that seem to ridicule the conspicuous Buddhist culture of the country This writers hunch is that the ONUR project is predicated on the wrong assumption that the single great obstacle to the establishment of national unity and reconciliation is the unnecessary supremacy (as they allege) accorded to the Buddhasasana, which according to them undermines the avowed secular democratic nature of the state. The same argument is adopted by foreign meddlers in our affairs and political and religious enemies of the unitary status and the Buddhist cultural foundation of the country. Actually, Buddhist principles are most compatible with the secular political ideals that countries of the West claim to adopt. (It is a different matter that most of our politicians {of course, they may be pretending}, monks, and ordinary voters do not know what actually secularism as applied to governance means; they think that it means rejection of all religious values in governing! whereas secularism denotes the principle of separation of the state from religious institutions, which is what the Christian (majority) USA, the Christian (majority) UK and other Western Christian (majority) nations are adopting, and what Buddhist (majority) Sri Lanka should be allowed to adopt in freedom.) A frequent unrelated but true criticism that is raised by friend and foe alike against followers of Buddhism is that there is a glaring discrepancy between practice and precept.

Kanepahara too, perhaps, contains its own rebuttal, if it is that bad. After all it turns out to be an attack on the traditional practices of Buddhists

But the same criticism can be confidently raised against the followers of any religion. What matters is the fact that this charge is selectively applied to Sinhalese Buddhists by anti-Sinhalese Buddhist extremists. Politically motivated Tamil academic Stanley Tambiah wrongly accused Sinhalese Buddhist monks of being behind the anti-Tamil violence that was in reality, as knowledgeable Sri Lankans came to justifiably suspect post-event, conspiratorially instigated by internal and external enemies of the Sri Lankan state on a number of occasions in the past.
His 1992 book Buddhism Betrayed  Religion, Politics and Violence in Sri Lanka was about this false claim of his. He excoriated Anagarika Dharmapala, the international Buddhist missionary and anti-British Sinhalese nationalist social reformer, and arguably the only great Sri Lankan who made the most significant impact on the rest of the world in the past 140 years as a mere irresponsible trouble maker (The Anagarika did this as a missionary of Theravada Buddhism, the really authentic version of the Buddhist doctrine that is most acceptable to the West). Misled by such racially prejudiced intellectuals or determined to exploit their decidedly anti-Sinhalese Buddhist inauthentic theories for their own purposes, those political and religious Sri Lanka bashers seem to be at present having the best time of their crusade. 
This baseless assumption that the unitary character of the Sri Lankan state with its dominant Buddhist cultural identity is prejudicial to the minorities is flying in the face of reality. The reality is that traditional communal harmony has held among ordinary Sri Lankans despite nearly three decades of civil strife, which ended in 2009. The strongest contributory factor that made this possible was the generous, inclusive, non-violent, accommodating nature of the dominant religious (Buddhist and Hindu) culture of the nation. The final stages of the civil war brought all Sri Lankans closer together than ever before. The then government started addressing urgent concerns of the northern and eastern provinces even before the war was well over. The five-year period that followed saw Sri Lanka moving in the correct direction in every sphere: national security, economic development, post war normalization of communal relations, return of democracy to the previously war-torn north and east provinces, etc. However, as now clear in retrospect, the change that was forced on the country at the beginning of 2015 has gravely undermined the forward march of the Sri Lankan nation. Launching an unwanted cultural crusade against the majority community at this stage, while the whole nation is under siege as it were, even though it might possess some positive features, can only be counterproductive.

Ministers site inspection exposes lies and violations
	
Minister de Silva along with other govt officials and residents at the construction site yesterday
There is no doubt that Sri Lanka should have more and more investors, paving the way for economic growth, but not at the cost of environment and its people. A country must have development that is sensitive to the concerns of its people. Therefore, the responsible authorities must strike a balance between environment and development.
The Daily Mirror on September 13 published an Expose titled Nuisance next door quoting a group of residents in Off Buthgamuwa Road, Rajagiriya who stated that an Indian property developer, Iconic Developments Private Limited, was allegedly involving in the illegal filling of a marsh, forcibly using a private road and building an unauthorised bridge as the main access to the companys new super-luxury condominium project named Iconic Galaxy.
State Minister of National Policies and Economic Affairs Dr. Harsha De Silva intervened into the issue following the DM article and visited the controversial construction site two days after the article was published. After meeting with the affected residents, he organised a meeting with Sri Lanka Land Reclamation and Development Corporation (SLLRDC) Chairman Roshan Gunawardena and Municipal Commissioner of Sri Japura-Kotte Wasanthi Rathnapala. The meeting was held yesterday morning in keeping with the plans of the minister. But despite having been asked to and been called more than ten times by Minister De Silva himself, the Commissioner of Sri Japura-Kotte Wasanthi Rathnapala could not be reached. The meeting was held with the presence of SLLRDC Chairman Roshan Gunawardena and officials of the Board of Investment (BOI). The residents, said that the officials along with the minister had gone inside the Iconic Galaxy construction site and even spoken to the representatives of Maga Company, the constructor.
Filling of the land
Residents provided documentary evidence to the effect that SLLRDC has authorised the developer to develop only 40% of the land area and has permitted to lay sea sand in the balance 60% of the area as a temporary measure to facilitate the movement of construction machinery and vehicles. However it was observed that the developer has allegedly violated this condition and filled the balance 60% of the area with earth. Construction workers admitted that sea sand was never used.
The Minister mentioned that if he had not intervened and arranged this site visit, these violations would have gone unnoticed and been ignored by officials
It was revealed at a meeting chaired by the Adviser to Ministry of National Policies & Economic Affairs R.Paskaralingam, that officials have provided information to the effect that the Developer has removed temporary filling in 60% of the area. However Minister Silva observed that this information was untrue. Residents pointed out that at the first instance that the requirement of temporary filling to facilitate the movement of construction vehicles and machinery was necessary as the ground was marshy and had a soft surface. But now the status quo has been changed due to the filling with earth and subsequent compression. Residents stated that the status of the land should be brought back to the original status and warned that if increased there would be a threat of flooding, which they said should be avoided.
Threat of a flood
Residents pointed out that this area was a marshy land before filling and was a designated flood water retention area. As a result of filling with earth and due to the weight of construction machinery, the earth has been compressed. This they say has lessened the earths capacity to absorb a great volume of flood water, hence increasing the threat of floods in the area. The Minister mentioned that if he had not intervened and arranged this site visit, these violations would have gone unnoticed and been ignored by officials.
Building a bridge across the canal
Although an official of the SLLRDC initially denied having given permission to construct a bridge, subsequent to residents providing a copy of a letter signed by GM of SLLRDC confirming that permission was granted for a bridge at the planning committee held on 7th Dec 2011, officials of SLLRDC admitted having granted approval for it. Residents questioned as to who approved the design of the bridge because what the developer is constructing is not a bridge, but a massive ramp; which stretched from one side of the canal right up to their building. This goes over the canal and canal reservation. It was further pointed out that if the design of the ramp was approved by SLLRDC, only residents of Iconic project would be able to use the bridge and that the residents right of way into the area and to cross the canal would be denied. Further it was pointed out that if this design had been approved, it would have effectively conceded the canal and canal reservation to a private Indian company. The minister mentioned that this had to be the only bridge of this kind in Sri Lanka.
Residents of a parallel lane complained to the Minister that their houses had been damaged due to piling and construction activities
Road public orprivate 
A copy of the gazette notification number 1626 dated 30th October 2009 was submitted by the residents and the Minister and the officials physically inspected the boundary limit specified in the gazette as a municipal road. It was established that the road gazetted as a municipal road in the above gazette is not the access road from Buthgamuwa Road to the Iconic site, but only a by-road from this road. Both officials of BOI and SLLRDC mentioned that they have been misled to believe that access road from Buthgamuwa Road to Iconic site is from a municipal road, but now they understand that this is a private road. The minister mentioned that officials responsible for providing incorrect information should be dealt with as per the law. It appears that even the developer has been misled by officials. Minister de Silva stated.
Residents provided documentary evidence to the effect that this road is a 22 ft road as approved by the Kotte MC and all residences have development plans approved by the Kotte MC.
We support development, but strictly within laws and regulations
The minister mentioned that although these type of projects should go through the Development Council, which he co chaired, this project never came to the council. Hence he instructed the Chairman of SLLRDC and officials present from BOI to arrange a meeting as at the earliest, which should include officials from other relevant Government agencies, and ensure that development takes place as per the laws and regulations. He said that he is fully supportive of development, but strictly within laws and regulations and neither the residents nor developers should violate them. He said that the biggest issue is the threat of flooding due to filling the land and the other issues are the bridge and ensuring rights of residents of a private road. He instructed the officials to find solutions for these issues.

Residents of a parallel lane complained to the Minister that their houses had been damaged due to piling and construction activities related to this project and the Minister instructed the officials from BOI to look into their grievances.
One of the residents, Col. Retd. Vikum Siriwardana expressing his gratitude to the minister said yesterdays scenario, where the minister mediated in the issue to bring about a fair solution to both parties was a very rare occurrence, in a country where the majority of so called peoples representatives confine themselves to talking and could be easily influenced by powerful and wealthy.
The new bridge across the canal is under construction
Further it was pointed out that if this design had been approved, it would have effectively conceded the canal and canal reservation to a private Indian company
An MP, who really cares for his people, stood for justice and fair play at any cost. His unwavering commitment to ensure laws and regulations are strictly adhered to by everyone and his willingness to stand up to high-ups in his own Government to ensure the rights of ordinary citizens is an example to others. Thank you Dr Harsha De Silva. I am sure violations of regulations exposed this morning would be rectified and disciplinary action would be initiated against public officials responsible for corruption and negligence of their duties, he said.

Myanmar army should be removed from politics: UN probe
	

YANGON AFP, Sept18, 2018 -Myanmars powerful army should be removed from politics, UN investigators said Tuesday, as they released the final part of a damning report reiterating calls for top generals to be prosecuted for genocide against the Rohingya Muslim minority. 
A brutal military crackdown last year forced more than 700,000 Rohingya to flee over the border to Bangladesh. 
The UNs 444-page probe called for the militarys top leadership to be replaced and for the institution - locally known as the Tatmadaw to have no further influence over the countrys governance.

Myanmars military dominates the Buddhist-majority country, holding a quarter of seats in parliament and controlling three ministries. 
But the report said that the countrys civilian leadership should further pursue the removal of the Tatmadaw from Myanmars political life, referring to the nations armed forces. 
The UNs meticulously detailed analysis, based on 18 months work and more than 850 in-depth interviews, calls on the international community to investigate military top brass for genocide, including commander-in-chief Min Aung Hlaing. 
Myanmars army has denied nearly all wrongdoing, insisting the military campaign was justified to root out Rohingya insurgents. 
But the UN team said the militarys tactics had been consistently and grossly disproportionate to actual security threats.

## Title: OF COURSE RAGGING CAN BE STOPPED!

OF COURSE RAGGING CAN BE STOPPED!
	

Ever since I remember (and that dates back longer than I care to mention) ragging has been the hot topic vis-a-vis the Universities of Sri Lanka. Under Sir Ivor Jennings  or at least while he was Vice Chancellor, the Colombo University rivalled the British ones. The standards were so high it was felt that going to England for ones education was not strictly necessary. The same education could be had right here in Colombo.
Of course the more affluent ones went anyway  mainly to Oxford and Cambridge - but those that did not felt in no way inferior in knowledge and education if they had studied at the Old University College, subsequently renamed the Univ. of Colombo. Of course a gentlemanly type of ragging took place even then. I use the word, gentlemanly purposely here. It was not the thuggish, perverted acts that take place now at the hands of young people whose behaviour could rival anything the torture chambers of the various World Wars could dream up. If not actually as painful certainly as disgusting. Such undergrads make up a goodly number of the raggers now. 
Mind you, the frustrated and outrageously behaved raggers of today are always in the minority but the majority of others are bullied and thoroughly cowed into submission since they receive no protection from the authorities. One really has to wonder what sort of minds these psychotic young raggers have From where do they get their preposterous ideas 

Make every university entrant sign a form agreeing to instant expulsion if he/she engages in anti-social activities

On a personal note I have to say that naturally ragging took place when I entered the University of Bombay at my All-Girls College. My own particular rag was (inhind sight) rather imaginative. I was told I had to steal a sari from a shop at the foot of the hill where my College was situated. Although I did not know it, the shop had been told to look the other way when I made the steal but I was not aware of this while I had to somehow engineer the switch from sari-counter to handbag. I made elaborate plans with my friends to distract salesmen. As intended by the raggers, I was a nervous wreck. My appetite deserted me which was all to the good, but I carried out the criminal deed without a hitch but quaking so badly I could hardly make it out of the shop.
Having triumphantly displayed my loot to my Seniors I was then told the truth. The sari was returned and a highly amused shopkeeper let me keep it. It cost Rs.18/, but was a most attractive cotton one which I wore triumphantly for years.. When my young daughter went to the same College for her first two years of University ragging had somehow got less pleasant. Hearing she was a dancer, the Seniors would make her do splits whenever they ran into her.
As any Dance Teachers would tell you, splits can only be done after a warm up. Doing them without the warm up is muscle endangering and to this day my daughter suffers from muscle problems. But yet  all this was not life threatening and there was no malice in the ragging.
But today and for the last few decades there have been students in our Universities who have totally given up University careers. Others who have been maimed for life and still worse  those who have been driven to suicide. Yet these cruel and vicious perpetrators still remain in University, educated with our tax money and finally go out into the world with their Degrees in their unworthy, grasping hands. And then to add insult to great injury, a foolish Government (that has done nothing to help the victims) actually give them jobs.
Ragging can be stopped. It is not difficult. I have been writing about it for the last 30 years but no one has even discussed the possibility of a solution with me or other like- minded teachers and Principals. Instead, students, protesting every inch of the way against punishments somehow get away with it.
The University Professors try to help a little albeit very guardedly  and get locked up in their offices for their pains. That regrettable streak of malice that underlies every unsuitable University entrant is brought to fruition and encouraged by similarly unsuitable entrants. Water finds its own level and like calls to like. The sadistic tendencies of the few are quickly harnessed by those already there and those better suited to a University education than these thugs do not have a chance.
I read of the latest doing in the Universities with stunned incredulity. I have a simple solution (I think). It is far too simplistic, sniffed a well known University Don. But like many problems that exist all over the place, a simplistic solution has often been proved to be the most effective.
MAKE EVERY UNIVERSITY ENTRANT SIGN A FORM AGREEING TO INSTANT EXPULSION IF HE/SHE ENGAGES IN ANTI-SOCIAL ACTIVITIES. List the anti social activities so that there is no doubt in anyones mind as to what is regarded as anti-social. If the students do not like it they need not sign and higher education must be denied to them. C.W.W. Kannagaras Pearl of Great Price is a singularly lustreless pearl these days.
A strong Government can make such student signing compulsory and retro-active so that the present uncontrollable lot are also brought under the jurisdiction of sensible laws. But of course we do not have a strong enough Government that will take on rioting University students even though 91% of the students would applaud such a move and ensure the present government gets their votes at the next election. After all this is all our Ministers are thinking about arent they
Another deterrent to these viciously sadistic monsters is the good old fashioned viva. Sri Lankan students travel all the way to the UK, the USA and elsewhere for that all important Viva which will tell the committee of interviewers whether the child is what they are looking for in that particular area of knowledge. Modern technology has allowed students to be interviewed on SKYPE.
Now what is the difficulty is getting a group of incorruptible, educated. kindly disposed and available adults to act as the Viva committee It must be an honorary job so that only those vitally concerned with the future of Universities will agree to give their time and expertise to selecting suitable candidates for future higher education. Off-hand I can think of ten such men and women quite easily.

Today, and for the last few decades, there have been students in our Universities who have totally given up University careers

These suggestions of mine are probably tediously repetitive to those who bother with the state of education in Sri Lanka. They are repetitive because nothing is ever done when there is so much to be done. I sound eerily like Cassandra  that prophetess of ancient times who was cursed by the Gods . The curse was that she would never be believed even though she was always in the right.
While I am no Cassandra, I can see that all the educational reforms recently highlighted in the Press are not going to help the University situation one bit. 
Most of us agree that all the University students could do with a great deal of psychological counselling but since this is not possible let us do the next best thing and try to improve the quality of students many of the present ones have no business being in the Universities of Sri Lanka in the first place. They have massive inferiority complexes which they take out on students they perceive as being superior.
This may not be the case, but perception is hard to define, and sometimes the fact that one student is from a better school can set off a chain reaction of dislike which leads to those dastardly acts of which I spoke earlier. Most of todays graduates are up in Government Departments. I am told. They do not necessarily want to work in the Private sector. This is all to the good since they are virtually unemployable anyway. (I am exempting the Engineering Faculty from my comments) I am told that things are much better at the University of Moratuwa and that its students do not suffer from tortured sleep thanks to unwanted bullies in their midst..
Whether this is due to the still pervasive influence of men like former Vice Chancellor, Sir Arthur C. Clarke, or to enlightened professors like Dr. Willy Mendis, I am not sure. I know that Dr. Mendis has commented to me on the brilliance of some of his engineering students who show inventiveness and high intelligence. The atmosphere in Moratuwa obviously encourages excellence. It does not do so elsewhere alas!

Most of todays graduates are up in Government Departments, I am told. They do not necessarily want to work in the Private sector

Seeing the way the doctors are behaving of late I am not at all sure that the Medical Colleges (most of all) do not need a total re-vamping of attitudes and instructions on How to be a Doctor. After all, doctors of the GMOA, you were educated with my taxes too. There is something seriously awry with the attitudes they are picking up or being taught during their course of study.
In some sort of mysterious, meticulously unselfish, non- vote catching and business-like fashion cannot the Sri Lankan Government do something that will produce graduates who are not wastrels and rakes but graduates whom we can unashamedly and proudly call Graduates of Sri Lanka Is that an impossible dream

Pyxle Celebrates 15 Years with Vision 2.0
	
Presantha Jayamaha, Founder and Director, Pyxle
Enterprise technology solution provider, Pyxle, celebrates 15 years of success this year. The company marked this milestone with the launch of its new workspace and brand Pyxle 2.0 - a fresh vision for the next decade at a company that has evolved from its humble beginnings to become an industry pacesetter, delivering digital transformation and technology solutions to clients across four continents.
Pyxle was founded by Presantha Jayamaha in 2003 with a small team and a simple vision that focused on delivering innovative solutions and cultivating a thriving workforce. This philosophy resounded well with a commitment to working hard and thinking smart. Today Pyxle is seen as a trusted name at the forefront of enterprise technology solutions. Tier 1 and Fortune 500 companies across four continents turn to Pyxle for transformation strategies that drive revenue growth and improve operational performance.
The company is one of four tech businesses in Sri Lanka that global investment organisation Tavistock Group recently invested in under the group name Elovate. This Sri Lankan cluster offers partners value through end to end technological solutions covering hardware, software, marketing and analytics.
Pyxle offers partners a package of technology consulting, software development, managed IT and data services. Solutions focus on transforming day to day business to maximise efficiency and results. For example, the company has developed software products such as an enterprise reporting system for a U.S. Fortune 100 company to track energy performance contracts for property managers, and another that manages agricultural assets across millions of hectares.
Hayley Evans, President, Tavistock Group Australasia
Pyxle draws its strength from an entrepreneurial and driven team that is passionate about the transformative power of technology. They develop solutions that are based on an in depth understanding of a clients business and leverage on core partner strengths; changing the way these companies do business for the better. In turn Pyxle invests in its people - at the workplace, hard work, a hive mindset and friendship is valued and rewarded.
Pyxles 15-year journey has helped to transform how Sri Lankan businesses are perceived globally and has allowed the Pyxle team to gain valuable international exposure, says Founder and Director Presantha Jayamaha. Its only been 15 years, but in that time Pyxle has transformed from a small unit of two to a thriving family of 90 that works with partners around the world to consistently deliver, he says. This consistency has been key to our business, and it has kept us on our toes since 2003, even as we reach our milestones and set new targets.
Pyxle 2.0 is a vision for the companys next decade of growth, reflected in its new logo which enlivens the familiar print with a future forward design. Pyxles new vision is twofold, focused on providing innovative solutions that enable partners to change the way they do business, drive revenue and improve operational excellence. This tenet is underscored by a commitment to fostering a rockstar environment that enables the Pyxle team to thrive and create. A new office space thoughtfully designed to strengthen team dynamics and workplace wellbeing is a key element of the Pyxle 2.0 relaunch.
We are committed to growing the business over the next few years as a brand that is instantly recognizable as a leader from Sri Lanka and the region, says Jayamaha. To do this, of course, we will rely on continuing to build a strong team of disruptors, thinkers and innovators who are always curious about framing everyday problems via a tech lens.

SL stops import of Iranian oil ahead of sanctions
	
Sri Lanka has stopped crude imports from Iran and is actively switching to other crude grades, Petroleum Resources Development Minister Arjuna Ranatunga has told reporters in Fujairah, UAE.
According to The National, Minister Ranatunga has said Sri Lanka has stopped as soon as the US sanctions were announced.
We didnt buy [directly] from Iran. We buy from Singapore, Dubai, Fujairah. Were looking at signing government-to-government agreements over the next couple of months. Were looking at long term agreements, he said.
Sri Lanka, one of the smaller South Asian consumers of oil, was importing nearly all of its 50,000 barrels per day from Iran, which was then refined at the countrys sole refinery built to run on light crude imported from the Middle Eastern producer.
Following the threat of snapback sanctions against Tehran by the White House, Sri Lankas state oil company had earlier mulled paying for its oil imports and debts with tea. Sri Lanka is the worlds second-biggest producer of the commodity, behind Kenya. Iran, a big consumer of tea, imports 90 per cent of the commodity from India and Sri Lanka.
Colombo, however, is close to securing alternative supplies from other producers to ensure it didnt fall afoul of sanctions, said Mr. Ranatunga.
"We have identified a couple of crude [grades] and we have already started using them. That is one of the problems we have because the crude is very expensive as well. So were looking at [securing] cheaper crude and were very successful at that, he said.
Sri Lanka drew up contingency plans in 2012 to import oil from Saudi Arabia and Oman, when nuclear-related sanctions were imposed on Tehran.
Mr. Ranatunga declined to comment on where Sri Lanka is currently importing crude from.
The country is still on track to expand capacity at its Sapugaskanda refinery to 110,000 bpd, a scheme that was earlier planned to be developed by Iran, said the minister. But finding a replacement is expected to take up to four years, he said.
Were looking at 110,000 to 125,000 bpd capacity, and we need the 110,000 bpd by 2025, he told reporters.
The refinery, which is expected to cost $500 million, has received nearly five proposals, from companies in China, South Korea, the Middle East and Singapore.
Sri Lanka, which announced a licensing round earlier this year, has signed an agreement with US energy services firm Schlumberger and is in discussions with French energy major Total regarding gas exploration, said Mr. Ranatunga.
The country has offered the Mannar and Dorado basins off its western coastline for gas exploration.
The licensing round will close next month, with preliminary results indicating potential for up to 1.8 trillion cubic feet of gas, said Mr. Ranatunga.
Full-scale exploration after data analysis will take another six years, he added.
Sri Lanka meets its oil requirements through imports alone. However, the end of its 25-year long civil war with the separatist Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam in 2008 has revived interest in developing its own oil and gas resources.

SL to buy Spanish ocean cleaner: Dy. Min. Mannapperuma
	
Mahaweli Development and Environment Ministry would buy a high tech ocean cleaning vessel through Spanish funds in near future, Deputy Minister of Environment Ajith Mannapperuma said.
The vessel is capable of cleaning waste in saline water, he said.
He was addressing a press conference at UNP headquarters Sirikotha this morning.
The ship would be bought following a request made by the Mahaweli Development and Environment Ministry.
He said the Ministry hoped to use the ship in special projects to clean 14 tourist beaches and to upgrade them among the best beaches according to international standards.
He said that a cleanliness of a beach was a main factor tourists considered when making decisions on destinations.
The Deputy Minister said the ship would be also used in removing oil spills like the recent incident at the Uswetakeiyawa Beach.
He said that the President had already discussed with the Minister of Ports and Shipping, to lease out the ship to the Sri Lanka Port Authority (SLPA) when the vessel was not engaged.
He said the Government could settle the funds obtained for the ship to the Spanish Government.
Ocean cleaner ships are capable of collecting marine debris, macro plastic waste and cleaning up ocean oil spills. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

In reference to the request by Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka to grant a general amnesty to the LTTE cadres and military personnel involved in war-related crimes, the Tamil National Alliance (TNA) said today that the two groups could not be equated at all.
Making his remarks on this matter, TNA MP M.A. Sumanthiran told the Daily Mirror that Tamil political prisoners had been arrested and held up for long years.
He said their cases were not over. They are being dragged on, he said.
He said these prisoners had been arrested on confessions made by them and detained for a long time.
However, he said the unidentified atrocities perpetrated by the military could not be equated with those of Tamil political prisoners.
MP Sumanthiran said there should be a truth-seeking mechanism in place to trace the kind of crimes committed before considering any amnesty. (Kelum Bandara)

Subtle methods of privatising Education and Health - EDITORIAL
	
It is said that Sri Lanka has a free education system and a free health service. To some extent, it is true as the Government schools and hospitals do not levy fees legally from students and patients. However, in a sense, one cannot call the countrys education and the health services free because authorities have developed various methods to levy money from the students and the patients or push them to the wall, where they have to spend money for the same services.
It is a well-known fact that the Government schools, especially those categorized as popular schools solicit hundreds of thousands of rupees as donations when students are admitted to them.
In fact, they are not donations but some sort of ransom. For the past several decades, the Education Ministers have been saying in the month of January each year that they would not allow Principals to receive this type of donations but except for one or two incidents, where Principals were caught, no student can get admitted to most of the schools in the country without paying this donation.
Trade Unions in the education and health sectors as well as Opposition and Leftist political parties are occasionally clamouring and sometimes taking trade union action against the purported moves by the Governments to privatise education and the health services.
But they turn a blind eye when some of the sections of these services were left to be privatised in a subtle manner during the past two decades. Interestingly, it is the very people who are shouting at the top of their voices against privatisation who are implementing this subtle method of privatisation and benefitting from it.One cannot deny the fact that todays students cannot pass the GCE Ordinary Level and the Advanced Level examinations without attending tuition classes.
The situation is such that the OL and AL students of even the most prestigious schools in the country are attending tuition classes. The irony is that in some cases it is the same teachers who are teaching in Government schools, who are conducting these tuition classes.And a considerable number of such teachers are those who are against privatisation of education. In short, education above Year 10 at the Government schools has been unofficially privatised with the help of those against privatisation.
In the health sector, the privatisation is making inroads in an even subtle manner, with the help of some of the doctors. The purported scarcity of medicine, especially expensive ones, is one factor that compels the patients to spend money on them and sometimes to go to the private hospitals. Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne had to ban prescription of blood tests to be done at private laboratories for the in-house patients at Government hospitals some time ago. And the private sector having well-known that their businesses would thrive has opened so many permanent private laboratories around Government hospitals.It is logical to conclude that it is the doctors who are shouting against privatisation and not the patients who want those tests to be done at private hospitals.
At the same time, authorities had announced several times that plans were afoot to issue bills to the patients at the Government hospitals just for their information on the expenditure that the Government incurs on the services provided to them.It is also a well-known fact that some of the doctors citing the shortage of medicines and certain facilities such as certain tests at the Government hospitals persuade and guide the patients towards private hospitals where they practise.
One service in the health sector that is almost fully privatised by now is the service of attendants. There was a time when relatives of in-house patients at the Government hospitals had to beg with the doctors and the nurses to stay in the wards with their patients. Rarely were those requests entertained in those days. However, now the doctors and the nurses force the relatives to find somebody to stay with the patients at the wards. And there are people to be hired for this purpose in and around the wards and the hospitals. They charge at will, sometimes Rs. 2,500 per night, for this service.
And now there are unregistered companies that hire such private attendants and these private attendants take charge of three or four patients or sometimes more than that at a time. Can we call education and health free

Taxation and tobacco industry in Sri Lanka
	
It was reported in the media that during the Cabinet discussion on 11th September 2018 on disallowing the sale of loose cigarettes, which was initiated by the Minister of Health, the Minister of Finance had objected to the measure stating that tobacco control measures have resulted in a loss of Rs. 18 billion to the Government. 
We feel that the actual facts relating to this statement should be bought before the public of Sri Lanka who bear the brunt of the enormous health, social and economic costs of tobacco use.
Contrary to the statement of the alleged loss, the Government income has increased significantly annually from tobacco tax. According to statistics of the Ministry of Finance, there has never been a loss of Rs. 18 billion as reported. The tax collected from tobacco increased by Rs. 26.2 billion between 2015 and 2017 to an all-time high of Rs. 107.4 billion which is a significant and historic increase of 32%.
Decreasing the use and harm of tobacco is a policy that the President has stood for a considerable period of time. We also strongly support the steadfast and proactive role played by the Minister of Health in bringing in new polices and strengthening current policies and laws to address this issue. International technical agencies such as the World Health Organization (WHO) and the World Bank strongly state that tobacco use is a net loss to any economy and recommends measures to prevent its use. 
Taxation is one of the most effective measures to decrease the use of tobacco, especially among the young and the poorer segments of the society.When optimally applied, tobacco taxation can decrease the consumption of tobacco, and at the same time increase government revenue.We should be proud as a country to see tobacco use decreasing. 
A study conducted by the National Authority on Tobacco and Alcohol and the WHO showed that the loss to Sri Lanka from tobacco use in 2015 was significantly more than the tax collected. The Ministry of Health Estimates that around 20,000 people die each year in Sri Lanka due to tobacco use, which is more than 50 persons per day. The World Health Organization considers tobacco and the single most preventable cause of premature death in the world.
It is a well-known fact that everywhere in the world, the tobacco industry brings in spurious and blatantly false arguments when tobacco tax increases are discussed. It is the same in Sri Lanka where many false and unsubstantiated statements about cigarette smuggling and increasing use of bidi find their way to the media. All the current claims by the tobacco industry and its proxies on increased tobacco smuggling and increasing bidi use has not been substantiated by any data from an acceptable sources. It is obvious anyone that if the largest selling cigarette brand in Sri Lanka is too expensive as claimed, tobacco users will switch to less expensive, well known and legal brands available in the market without switching to beedi use or unknown smuggled brands overnight.

Thailand says FTA with Sri Lanka to be finalised by 2020
	
Negotiation on a Sri Lanka-Thailand Free Trade Agreement (FTA) would be concluded by 2020, the Thailand Nation reported today quoting a high-ranking Thai official.
Auramon Supthaweethum, Director-General at the Thailands Department of Trade Negotiations said Thailand will host the second Thai-Sri Lanka FTA negotiations from Wednesday until Friday.
The first meeting was hosted by the Sri Lankan government in July when the two countries discussed brief outlines of the FTA, Auramon said.
In the second meeting from September 19-21, we will start discussing the details of the FTA. We will discuss issues concerning market opening, trade in services, and further economic cooperation between the two countries, she said.
She said they will create seven working panels to evaluate and discuss different issues within the FTA.
For example, the first panel will work on trade in goods between Thailand and Sri Lanka and will focus on negotiating tariff reduction. Meanwhile, the second panel will work on the rule of origin, a criterion that determines which type of goods are eligible for tariff reduction under the FTA, she said. 
Sri Lanka is Thailands fourth-largest trading partner in South Asia. Thai-Sri Lankan trade was valued at $319.6 million from January to July this year, with Thailand enjoying a large trade surplus with Sri Lanka. Thai imports were worth $47.9 million while exports were valued at $271.7 million.
Auramon said the prospects for Thai-Sri Lankan trade were promising, as the total trade value had increased by 6.7 per cent compared to the same period last year. Apart from opening markets to boost trade in goods, Thailand will also place emphasis on trade in services as Thai investors have a growing interest to invest in Sri Lankas tourism industry.
Various Thai international hotel brands have already invested and established themselves in Sri Lanka such as the Dusit Thani, Central, Minor Hotel and Amari groups.
Thai investors are already investing in Sri Lanka without the FTA, hence, with the FTA, issues such as investing in established businesses, cooperation negotiations and buying Sri Lankan stocks will become more convenient. Sri Lanka presents a good trading opportunity for Thailand because it is beginning to open up its economy to foreign investors. Hence, if Thailand enters as one of the early investors in Sri Lanka, it may get tariff reduction benefits in the future when it comes to trading, Auramon said.
Furthermore, Sri Lanka currently has FTAs with India, Pakistan and Singapore and is also a part of Chinas Belt and Road Initiative. Therefore, Sri Lanka can also be a pathway for Thailand to enter the Indian market, she said.
Thailands main exports to Sri Lanka are dried fish, rubber and automobile parts while Thailand imports jewellery, gold and plant products from Sri Lanka. Thailand aims to increase bilateral trade to $1.5 billion by 2020.

The POWER OF THE CROSS  AT THE SHRINE
	
Come September, the glorious month of the seasons with thrashing waves racing beneath the azure skies towards the golden shore dotted with swaying palms as the ascending sun slowly but softly cast its brilliant rays warming up the sleepy earth, was the perfect backdrop to a multitude of worshippers in their thousands from every corner of the island to venerate Jesus upon the cross. 
The venue was the National Shrine of the Holy Cross at Marawila, a spiritual landmark and a very important day in the Catholic calendar. 
There was no breathing space even for a pin to drop, all Christians waiting impatiently to hear their gentle shepherd speak which is yet another reason to draw thousands. Bishop of Chilaw, Rev. Dr Valence Mendis, spiritually mesmerize crowds when he speaks. 
Eloquent but simple for everyone to understand, have the God-given gift of tapping every single heart with an aura that very few religious leaders are blessed with. There is silence prevailing when his voice rises; even the thrashing waves roll back to the sea. Hush is the word. 
The theme for the day was our commitment to the holy cross and its impact on lifes journey as Jesus has preached us. 
He commenced the holy mass praying for the world and all people invoking blessings and guidance to be real Christians. 
We have to look up to the cross as the ultimate salvation by maintaining family values and resolving problems within and the world will look after itself as Jesus preached. 
From where I was, I could see his eyes shining under lights visibly shaken holding back tears and almost whispered in a shattered voice about the neglected children scattered around the world. 
Our innocent children from broken homes, from the ravage of war, orphaned, street children starving, perishing with no one to turn to Let us put our hands together and pray for the innocence that sanity will prevail and find peace in Jesus hands. 
Hush and there was silence as the multitude of devotees put their hands together in unison. It was a marvellous reaction for over three minutes of silence. He had touched every core of each heart. I have never seen such a spectacle even in the west. 
He also continued touching on the global destruction of the environment and the damage done. 
It is not only the nations that are affected but animal population, flora and fauna. We all have to be responsible and leave their habitat for them. They are born free and thats how they should be. Do your mite as responsible people and give them breathing space so they will live without fear. 
The embodiment of the Living Christ, the simple structure which is home to the statue of Christ is unlike the grandeur of big churches. Main worshippers are those living in Marawila that accounts to thousands and Jesus Christ who taught his disciples to be fishers of men shine through their lives.

The diocese of Chilaw has many numbers of worshipping places frequented by the fishing community leading to Puttalam under the care of their Shepherd, Bishop Valence who tirelessly creates the spiritual environment. The status is miraculous, unlike many others where Christ looks down tenderly with forgiveness on us who have betrayed and led him to be crucified. 
The statue was shipped from Bangalore to the Port of Colombo and brought by train to Nattandiya where a group of devotees brought it to Marawila. When the Station Master opened the crate, it was in pieces much to the heart-broken, devastated the then Fr. Thiri who bought it for Rs. 2.50. 
He installed it in the present graveyard. This was from 1877 to 1921. It had been the French Fr. Ferdinand Thiri who had been the Parish Priest at Marawila from 1909 to 1924 who had ordered the statue from Bangalore. 
Today, the statue stands in all spiritual glory as the shrine has been declared a national shrine, a sacred venue to the whole of Sri Lanka.

Weeding out the unwanted!
	

The Green leader recently attended a meeting of the partys electoral level organizers of the Kandy district held to review the progress of the partys crash propaganda programme planned out in connection with the upcoming provincial and national polls.

Addressing the gathering, the Green leader announced that they had no alternative but to remove the weak organizers to make way for the new blood. No sooner had the party leader issued this ultimatum than a din rose from the audience calling for the immediate removal of a Diyawanna member and another electorate organizer from their posts.
The Diyawanna member they had wanted to be ousted from his organizer post immediately is a politico hailing from a political family dominating an electorate adjoining the Kandy district. This member had been in the news in the recent past for some shenanigans of his which the public had
frowned on.
The Green leader, thereupon, called on the partys Kandy district Lucky leader to suitably deal with the two organizers who had drawn a howl of disapproval from the audience.

Wholesale price of sugar 1kg up by Rs.15
	
The wholesale price of 1kg of sugar was increased by Rs. 15, while the retail price was increased by Rs.20-30 with effect from today, Sri Lanka Sugar Importers Association (SLSIA) Deputy President Hemaka Fernando said.
Addressing a news briefing, he said the prices had to be increased considering the Governments decision to increase the entire tax amount imposed on sugar to Rs. 49 from Rs.31.
Prior to the decision, only the customs duty of Rs.31 was imposed on sugar because sugar had been included to the Special Commodity Tax List. However, the Government removed sugar from the list on this Tuesday that resulted in adding another three taxes like PAL, Excise Duty and National Building Tax (NBT), Fernando said.

## Title: Are You Aware of Thalassaemia

Are You Aware of Thalassaemia
	
Thalassaemia Awareness sessions conducted for Students
Thalassaemia is recognised as a common genetic disorder in Sri Lanka. The disease occurs due to haemoglobin,the main component of red blood cells not been produced in sufficient quantities.
Treating low blood cells of Thalassaemia, result in iron accumulation within vital organs, and if it is not treated, it can result in complications and abnormalities, especially affecting the growth and development of children.
For patients diagnosed with the disease, blood transfusions must be given once in 2-3 weeks or monthly. In addition, they have to live with a fitted device that removes the excess iron from the body, consuming medicinedaily in the morning after fasting and undergo severe hardships.
During the first year of a childs birth, Thalassaemia can be diagnosed and these children will have to receive treatment from then onwards until their entire lifetime.
As this disease is life-threatening, lack of regular treatment will result in death. Due to these reasons, the affected children face physical and mental depression while the parents too endure mental, social and economic decline.
Due to all these issues, we should all join together in order to effectivelyhelp and support to prevent Thalassaemia.
In the case of Thalassaemia, there are carriers of the disease who dont have any symptoms or clinical effects. They are identified through blood tests and are not in danger of the disease. As they do not display any ill effects they live a completely normal, healthy life, free of symptoms.
Unfortunately, if two carriers marry and have children, there is a high probability that the child may fall as a victim to life-threatening Thalassemia.
The main aim of the Thalassemia prevention programme is toadvice younger couplesbefore marriage to take a blood test and check for the presence of the faulty gene responsible in causing Thalassemia. This could help in taking better decisions and avoid giving birth to children with Thalassemia.
There are many facilities in the treatment and care of Thalassemia in Sri Lanka, especially the dedicated Adolescent and Adult Thalassaemia Care Unit at the North Colombo Teaching Hospital, Ragama located at No:10, SrimavoBandaranayake Mawatha, Mahara,Kadawatha.
This unit is dedicated to the treatment and management of adolescent and young patients afflicted with Thalassaemia and also the only unit in Sri Lanka dedicated for the management of adult Thalassaemic patients.
While all services and treatmentsare supplied free of charge, it is also the sole Government unit in the Western Province committed to treat Thalassaemic patients. Additionally,other treatment centers have also been established in collaboration with Teaching hospitals located in Kurunegala, Badulla and Anuradhapura.
At these centers, individuals are screened by conducting a blood test to identify carriers. If identified as a carrier they are given a pink card and if not a carrier they are presented a green card. This in effect becomes their identification card for Thalassaemia.
For young couples looking to get married, this card will serve as a carrier status. This enables the young couples to make better decisions and to reduce the risks of giving birth to offspring with the life-threatening and dreaded Thalassaemia disease.
Marriage with a pink cardholder, without previously testing ones blood could lead to an unsafe marriage. Additionally, both partners also not testing their blood prior to marriage could lead to an unsafe marriage.
However, if both are holders of green cards or if one has a green card and the partner a pink card, these marriages can be deemed safe marriages. Thus it is imperative and extremely advisable that both individuals understand and know their carrier status prior to marriage.
Youth in the Western Province can now receive information, advice and other services from the center. In addition, the center aims to visit Universities and schools to conduct public awareness sessions and educate youth on the Thalassaemia disease.
As a novel initiative of Union Assurances unique corporate social responsibility brand, Union Manushyathwaya, the orgnisation is working in collaboration with the National Thalassemia Centre contributing invaluable support through resources, effort and financial assistance conducting thalassemia awareness and prevention campaigns helping to create healthier and secure communities.

There is no letup in the bitter feuding going on between the Northern alliance bigwigs and the big Wig in the North, but the peacemakers have not given up their hopes either, they say.

On the heels of the peacemakers latest bid to arrange a meeting between the two parties in Colombo, Wig himself had rung up the elderly leader and proposed September 5 for peace talks in Colombo. However, the proposed round had to be postponed in view of the opposition protest fixed for this day.
Later, the peacemakers keen on working out an agenda for the deferred roundtable had contacted the elderly leader to consult in this regard.
However, they had been shocked when the elderly leader had retorted: What peace talks! I cant recollect having promised to attend any peace talks!
Not to be outdone, the peacemakers, had, nevertheless, succeeded in refreshing the aged leaders memory about the promise he had made, they say.

Capitol TwinPeaks introduces Duplex Sky Bungalows on the bustling Beira Lakefront
	
The shift from landed housing to apartment living is a growing trend in Colombo; 24hr security, convenience of amenities, managed maintenance and elite community, adds to the allure of it all. The Citys unrealized potential for livability is being addressed with a steady supply of luxury apartments, and with Port Citys impending rise, Colombo will undoubtedly transform to a cosmopolitan big city, joining the ranks of richer nations in the region. The Beira Lakefront especially is fast becoming a sought after location for city-living with lifestyle conveniences in the immediate surrounding. Capitol TwinPeaks, as the purely residential project on the Lakefront, is introducing two-storey Duplex units or Sky Bungalows that stack two apartments together to create magnificent double height units. The spectacular vistas of the surrounding Ocean and Lake are heightened and can truly be enjoyed in these purpose-built units. This, as well as the ability to customize standard units, rather than accept cookie-cutter models, has increased the popularity of the project for the easy transition from traditional housing to sky living.
Capitol Developers as a member of the Sanken Group, is in a unique position to extend this custom design opportunity with synergy as Contractor/Developer. Sanken is the trusted name in construction for timely delivery and responsible for a vast majority of the Colombo skyline. The renowned P&T Group of Singapore as architects has designed a contemporary classic for TwinPeaks, incorporating 75% glass to its sparkling faade. Capitol TwinPeaks has thus, got good bones, evident with sales surpassing fifty percent of the 435 units on offer. The project is also well ahead of schedule in construction at level 17 of 50; building at a rate of one floor per week. Ready for occupation in December 2020 is the Groups promise and judging by their track record, a promise likely delivered.
Capitol TwinPeaks, along with Colombo City, is rising fast, and investors are encouraged to book before 1 December 2018 to avail themselves of Sky Bungalows and custom units at 24 Staple Street, Colombo 2. A visit to the model apartment at 18 Lillie St, Colombo 2 will have you talking with the sales and engineering teams of Sanken Group, to design and build your own piece of sky in the heart of new Colombo City. Lines are open 24/7 on 077 869 3787.

Caught with his hand in the till
	
A top executive of the oil corporation had suddenly stopped attending his office giving rise to much perplexity and speculation among the staff, they say.

His non-attendance has caused much inconvenience to his immediate subordinates who are being compelled to contact him over the phone every time they have to seek his approval or ruling regarding an important matter.
He does not come to work, but doesnt resign either! Nor is he being disciplinarily dealt with or being asked to go! This is a funny situation, a staffer remarked.
The high political authority concerned has been compelled to sort out certain issues by himself. Things will soon fall into a melting pot if the boss continues to play truant, the staffer added.
The obvious rift between the top executive and the high political authority has come as a surprise to many employees at the corporation as the duo had been on the best of terms all the time - getting along well together like milk and honey, according to some of them.
Meanwhile, a rumour says that man is only shying away after being caught with his hand in the till.

CONTROVERSIES, CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES!!!
	


One of the leading newspapers carries a front-page headline saying PRESIDENT CALLS FOR ELECTING AN HONEST MAN AS PM; what exactly is our President trying to infer here As opposed to that, we read in yet another newspaper that the Prime Minister has been given the Award for MOST ADMIRED NATIONAL LEADER, here in Sri Lanka and topping all of that, Mahinda Rajapaksa claims he has no truck with Sirisena!!! WHAT EXACTLY ARE WE BEING TOLD HERE The biggest disappointment is that RANIL wants to reappoint RAVI as Minister!!! Now, that is something nobody expected RANIL to suggest!!! The burning question is WHY Do we put two and two together and come up with five

Election time 
Notwithstanding the controversies; the challenges and opportunities are PLENTY!!! 5,307 farmers are scheduled to receive Rs. 40,000/- each per acre of cultivation during the Maha Season!!! Model Villages are targeted to hit 100 by years end in Matale; according to the Ministry of Housing and Construction!!!. On 8th September the 118TH Model Village SRIMATH GAMINI DISSANAYAKE PURA WAS OPENED IN THE KANDY DISTRICT; THE 119THSAHAJEEWANAPURA on 9th September IN THE TRINCOMALEE DISTRICT and THE 120THSEGIRIGAMA on 10th September, IN THE ANURADHAPURA DISTRICT!!! IN THE MIDST OF ALL THIS CONSTRUCTIVE HOUSING, OUR PRESIDENT HAS EVEN GONE ON TO SOLVE THE DRINKING WATER PROBLEM IN ANURADHAPURA!!! OH, THE WILL TO WIN, IS THE PROPELLANT THAT DRIVES MANY AN AMBITION TO ACHIEVE THE IMPOSSIBLE FOR THE GOOD OF THE PEOPLE NOW!!! THE CONSTRUCTION OF VILLAGES IS MOVING FORWARD IN LEAPS AND BOUNDS, WE HAVE NOW MOVED UP TO THE 125TH MODEL VILLAGE AND COUNTING!!!

Big or Small
In a lighter vein and addressing a very worthy cause, Ceylinco General Insurance personnel took to the streets to educate people and road users and urged them to look at the terrible deterioration in civic values!!! They laid particular emphasis on NO to child abuse, drug abuse and sexual violence!!! This column has emphasized the importance of this many times, with no concrete results!!! The group is going to take their programme islandwide!!! IT IS A TRULY HUMANITARIAN CAUSE WORTHY OF EMULATION BY MORE CIVIC CONSCIOUS PEOPLE AND COMPANIES!!! Looking at the less privileged, the abused, victims of violence and others, these are the VOICELESS FOR WHOM WE ARE PROUD TO BE THE VOICE!!!


Bus fares and bread prices
Moving into actual realities, the consumer is faced with a Fuel Price Increase of Rs, 4/-; bus operators demanding a further fare hike, while train fares are to be increased by 15% next month!!! This is in addition to the price of bread, which was put up by Rs. 5/-. At no point do we see that workers salaries are increased by even a nominal amount to meet the ever-increasing demands of consumerism!!!


No holds barred
While a second High Court-at-Bar is to be established, we cannot sufficiently emphasize the absolute need for it!!! Ironically, the miscreants of justice seem to stem from the very vanguards of justice!!! First, the Chief of Defence Staff ADMIRAL RAVINDRA WIJEGUNERATNE debunks to Mexico and the President is PERTURBED; he seems to be totally unaware of it or the gravity of the offences!!! Instead of letting these guys loose, THEY SHOULD IMPOUND THEIR PASSPORTS FIRST DONT THESE MORONS IN HIGH PLACES REALIZE THAT THE FIRST THING THESE MISCREANTS WILL DO IS RUN Next, we hear that a Voucher linked to a CHEQUE FOR ONLY RS. 10 MILLION TO RAVI K HAS BEEN DESTROYED!!! IS THIS THE MAN THE PRIME MINISTER WANTS TO BRING BACK TO THE MINISTERIAL FOLD Again we ask WHY In the similar vein, we have W.M. MENDIS & COMPANY destroying 102 ORIGINAL VOUCHERS!!! Moving from the ashes, topping all of the above, the IGP himself orders the CID to probe allegations against Senior DIGs for abuse of power and likewise, the STF HEAD URGES THE IGP TO PROBE ALLEGATIONS AGAINST THE STF!!! However, bowling the best googly ever, the guy in charge of finances at Sri Lanka Cricket bowled Sri Lanka Cricket for only US$5.5 MILLION STRAIGHT TO AN OFFSHORE ACCOUNT AND IS CURRENTLY UNDER INVESTIGATION BY THE CID AND FCID!!! That was a marathon in its purest form, no holds barred!!!


Dubai Nuts Cashew Nuts and SriLankan 
This time I would like to leave you on a hilarious note:
After 10 years in prison for theft, the Judge asks what do you think of doing to live a responsible life if you are released today Ha ha ha, thats simple Judge, I wish to become a POLITICIAN, BECAUSE IN POLITICS STEALING IS LEGAL!!!
Our President went nuts looking for Cashew Nuts on SRI LANKAN and instead of biting into the luscious SriLankan ones he got a Dubai one that even a dog couldnt bite!!! With all the delicious Sri Lankan Cadju we have in plenty, we wonder who got what on the Dubai deal
PERHAPS A BIG BITE!!! OUCH!!!

Craze for power blinds him to blaze at door!
	

A certain high-up in the public service, to be more precise, a head of a department much in the limelight these days, sent for a Pettah trader pal the other day.

The businessman who had received certain favours from the VIP in the past and quite eager to further strengthen the connection lost no time on calling on him.
The bigwig warmly welcomed the businessman and began a confidential chat with him. Presently, he brought out a copy of his horoscope from a pocket in his pants and told him: You may have heard of  (he mentions the names of two famous astrologers in India) I want you to get two separate readings of my horoscope by these two astrologers! I understand I have got a Rajayoga. Ask them to say how strong is this yoga and when it is going to fructify! He added: Remember this is a top secret!
The businessman readily undertook to carry out the mission. But he had no required Indian connections. Therefore, he quietly approached a leading politico in the estate sector known to be having ideal connections in India. The politico readily agreed to take the horoscope to the two leading astrologers in India.
Meanwhile, the departmental head is said to be waiting all agog for a word from the two astrologers about the Rajayoga indicated in his horoscope.
However, let alone, the fructification of a Rajayoga, the bigwigs future in the high office itself is reportedly in a state of uncertainty for his shenanigans in the recent past have seriously jeopardized his career in the public service, they say.

Gota can be defeated easily
	
20th Amendment is what we broadly campaigned for in 2015
	MR has no moral right to seek office again
	Government is run on Buddhist principles

Public Enterprise Development Minister Lakshman Kiriella, in an interview with the spoke about the current status of politics in the country, the possibly candidacy of former Defence Secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa and the financial position of SriLankan Airlines. Excerpts:

Q What is your opinion on former President Mahinda Rajapaksa trying to obtain legal clearance to contest the presidency again
Mahinda Rajapaksa has no moral right to seek office again. He conducted elections in 2015, two yeas in advance because he could not govern the country. He cannot contest again. According to the 19th Amendment, it is very clear. Mahinda Rajapaksa had a role to play. He played that role. That was in crushing the Tigers which was a long-felt need. That was his role in the countrys history. He is not a person who can initiate economic development in the country. He was unable to bring democracy and ensure human rights in Sri Lanka. Why did he have elections in 2015 If his Government had remained, Sri Lanka would have faced economic sanctions. When I was in the opposition, I was the shadow minister for foreign affairs. I used to follow these international developments very closely. If Mahinda had won in 2015, by March of that year, you would have faced sanctions.

QYou mean it has retrospective effect in that sense
Yes, it has.

QHave you studied it properly
Yes I have.

QRecently, President Maithripala Sirisena said it was the Prime Minister who was all powerful, not the President. What is your view
That is correct. Under the 19th Amendment, the President willingly gave away his powers to the Prime Minister. This is the first time in Sri Lankas history that the President has given away his power willingly to the Prime Minister.
We may have shortcomings as the Government. I do no deny that. But, the Yahapalana Government established democracy and the rule of law. Today, the judiciary is totally independent. There is media freedom to a very large extent.

We may have shortcomings as the Government. I do no deny that. But, the Yahapalana Government established democracy and the rule of law. Today, the judiciary is totally independent. There is media freedom to a very large extent

At that time, the Government was behind certain unlawful activities like abductions, disappearances of persons, the white van syndrome and sacking of the Chief Justice. Now, there is crime, but, the Government is not behind them. We are running the country on Buddhist principles. There are no abductions, disappearances, killing journalists, setting fire to the media institutions etc. The Government is not involved in any violence.
Mahinda boasted of being pro-Buddhist. To sustain Buddhism, there must be Amisa Pooja and Pratipatti Pooja. Amisa Pooja is building temples and monasteries. Pratipatti Pooja is following the principles of Buddhism.
The Yahapalana Government has followed Buddhist principles by upholding human rights , the rule of law and human dignity.

QHow do you view the international developments such as the United States pulling out from the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC)
We have to build up an argument. This is a clear set of double standards. One set of rules for the super powers, and another set for small countries. How can the UNHRC find faults with us when the country that supported the resolution on us violated the UN charter This shows the double standards of the big powers.

QHow is the United National Party (UNP) bracing for elections
We are ready. Ours is the single largest party in Sri Lanka. We are ready for elections. We are forming our party branches at village level. We are appointing new organisers.

QFormer President Mahinda Rajapaksa, in India, said that his brother would be a contender for the presidency. Indirectly, it means former Defence Secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa will be the candidate. How does the UNP view this
In my opinion, Gota can be defeated. That is as far as we are concerned. That is what I have to say.

QWhat is the reason for you to come to such a conclusion at this juncture
That is because he has too many skeletons in the cupboard. All those will be highlighted during the election campaign. It will be like the election campaign of Minister Sarath Fonseka at the 2010 Presidential Elections as the common candidate. When he was fielded, he was thought of to be the sure bet to become the President. When the campaign commenced, he succumbed. He exposed himself. Military men, in any case, do not make good campaigners.

QMinister Fonseka is your Cabinet colleague now. He is critical of the Government. What do you think of his conduct now
In the Cabinet, there is a thing called collective responsibility. You cannot speak out of turn. If you do not agree with the Cabinet, it should be taken up at the Cabinet itself. There is no point in holding press conferences and making statements to the media. It is an act of cowardice. We have the Cabinet meeting once a week. We can discuss everything there.

QHow do you see the current status of the Government as far as the chemistry between the President and the Prime minister is concerned
In the run up to the Local Government Elections on February 10, 2018, it was low. It has improved now.

QWhat is the position of the Government or the UNP regarding the 20th Amendment to the Constitution
I have not gone into the details of the amendments. If it is to abolish the Executive Presidency and to give powers to Parliament, I will support it personally.

How can the UNHRC find faults with us when the country that supported the resolution on us violated the UN charter This shows the double standards of the big powers.

QWhat is the Governments position
Still we have not taken a decision. We have not studied it as a Government. Recently, when I met JVP Leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake, I suggested to him to have a debate regarding this. We would like to know what it is about. He said it was too premature for a debate.
The 20th Amendment is broadly what we campaigned for in 2015- the abolition of executive presidency and restoration of parliamentary power.

QAs the Leader of House, how certain are you of getting this enacted in Parliament
It is too premature for me to say something. If it happens, former President Mahinda Rajapaksa will like it. That is because he can contest again.

QActually, the Government has undertaken its own constitution making exercise. It is already underway. You have made some progress. You even promised to present a draft of it to Parliament soon. Ahead of it, the JVP brought this out. Why is it
I think it is an option. The JVP would have intended to say that there are several options. The parties can decide at the relevant times what option should be taken.

QWhen are you going to present your draft
It will be done very soon.

QHow far have you progressed
I think we would get a basic draft very soon. In it, you will find the points we have agreed upon and the points on which we have several options. All options will be tabled in Parliament for the perusal of MPs.

QIt means there are areas to be reconciled among the parties. What are they
There is a question mark regarding the character of the Constitution- the unitary status. There are various versions of the unitary status. All those positions will be made known to Parliament. Once the draft is presented, the parties can debate it and reach some conclusion.

QWhat is the stand of the UNP regarding this matter
We believe in a unitary state, if there is agreement with other parties. Otherwise we will be flexible.

That is because he has too many skeletons in the cupboard. All those will be highlighted during the election campaign. It will be like the election campaign of Minister Sarath Fonseka at the 2010 Presidential Elections as the common candidate. When he was fielded, he was thought of to be the sure bet to become the President.

QSriLankan Airlines is under your purview. What are the plans in place to restructure it
It is totally in debt now. It amounts to US $ 110 million. The plan is this. First, the directors are not drawing any salary now. They are not given free air tickets to travel abroad. They have set an example for the future. We are looking for a foreign investor. Why did we fall into this mess Emirates was running this airline at big profit. During the Rajapaksa rule, the contract was terminated because the airline did not give free tickets to his entourage. At that time, the airline was run at US $ 20 million a year. That was prior to 2006 according to my guess. What has happened today It is run at huge losses. This is a result of one foolish act. It was a personal decision to get rid of Emirates.
If Emirates was there, the airline would have run it profitably. Their management style was good.
We are in search of an investor. But, no investor is ready to take over the airline with such massive liabilities. We want to remove debt from the balance sheets of the airline. We will create a special account in the Treasury for this purpose. That is a Special Purpose Vehicle. The balance sheets will be free of debt. We have to remove debt from the balance sheets. We have to show investors that we are on the right path. There are so many parties who are interested.

QCan you name a few
There are several from Japan, China and Germany.

Govt. analyst to submit report on voice recordings
	
Colombo Fort Magistrate M/s. Lanka Jayarathne today ordered the government analyst to submit an immediate report on the recorded telephone conversation over an alleged attempt to assassinate President Maithripala Sirisena and former Defence Secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa.
The magistrate also ordered to check whether the recordings were compared with the voices of Police Terrorist Investigation Division (TID) DIG Nalaka de Silva and Anti Corruption Force Organisation working Director Namal Kumara.
The suspects were ordered to provide a convenient date and a time to appear at the Government Analyst's Department and Ordered the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) officers to seek orders from the Court to inform the suspects.
Rejecting a request made by the CID to prevent both the complainant and the suspect from travelling abroad claiming this as a serious incident, the Magistrate ordered the CID to provide a detail report as based on which Act and Clause that would prevent them from travelling abroad.
Following a request made by a motion, the complaint was recalled and the mobile phone which relates to the incident was produced and handed over to court. (Manopriya Gunasekera)

The government had not taken any decision to hand over the Palaly domestic airport to India or any other country and said it would be developed in partnership with the Tourism Development Fund and Civil Aviation Authority, Transport and Civil Aviation Minister Nimal Siripala De Silva said yesterday.
He told Parliament that not only the Palaly domestic airport but also Higurakgoda, Baticaloa, Koggala, Digana and Trincomlee airports would be developed as domestic airports to cater to the needs of the people.
Joint Opposition MP Wimal Weerawansa asked in Parliament whether the government was planning to hand over the Palaly airport to the Indian Civil Aviation Authority as reported in Indian media.
There is no truth in that report. We have no intention to hand over the airport to India or any other country. However, it will be developed in partnership with the Tourism Development Fund and Civil Aviation Authority. We develop these airports not to hand them over to any other country he said.(Ajith Siriwardana)

Inadvertence or sheer cussedness
	

This character now holding a high political office once occupied a bench in the countrys judiciary.

He recently had occasion to attend a high court as a respondent in a political case.
The case was taken up for hearing in due course and when the name of this high office holder was called out, he had failed to stand up and curtsey to the court.
So, ahead of starting the court proceedings one of the judges had made it a point to remind the former judicial officer of the importance of paying due respect to the court as a court attendee.
Visibly embarrassed by this admonition, the former law officer immediately stood up and paid respect to the court with a bow, they say.

## Title: Jana Balaya Power of which People

Jana Balaya Power of which People
	
When we talk of the people, we need to make sure we are precise as to what type of people we are referring to
	
	Despite repeatedly being duped in Elections since Independence, we, the people, have not realized the distinction

If you happen to stumble upon Article 12 of the Constitution, which states all people are equal before the law, please, do not get too excited about it.As experience shows, it means virtually nothing to any serious minded person. Even a Fifth Grader knows that. Besides, there is no impediment to find amusement anywhere anytime, the document called the Constitution itself not being an exception.
Amusement aside, the Constitution is silent as to who the people are, either. No, people are not a monolith. For example, it could embrace as wide and varied creatures, as the term animal refers to a mouse as well as a whale; it could mean those who go to prison for stealing a few coconuts as well as those who remain at large, though implicated in multi-billion dollar scams.
It also includes the Tamil youth languishing in detention without charges as well as a top-brass officer of the Armed Forces enjoying all luxuries of liberty despite accusations of abduction and murder.


Oh, People!
What prompted such musings at this juncture was the recently staged Jana Balaya campaign organized by the Joint Opposition.
Opinion is varied on the success of this much-hyped campaign on September 5. Literally translated, Jana Balaya means Power of the people (People, again!). What the organizers wanted was a substantial show of strength to the Government, riding on the wave of the February clean sweep at LG elections and to wrest the initiative again from the Government, which has suddenly sprung into action, launching programmes such as Gam Peraliya and Enterprise Sri Lanka.
Watching footages of the protest, I could not help but wonder as to what motley a crowd, the people gathered, whose power was supposed to be demonstrated as the name suggests-were.
There were those people who had to wake up pre-dawn and board buses, spending a gruelling and long journey to reach Colombo, from Moneragala or Mahiyangana; and then there were the People who came in thirty forty million rupee price tagged SUVs or Land Rover Defenders or what not, and descended on the scene like demigods.
There were People who, for the want of a place to relieve themselves, had to look for nooks and corners in the city of Colombo as well as those, who had to lie on the pavement for a moments respite as the TV footage showed.
Then, you saw the People who had VIP suits in five or seven star hotels, enjoying the luxuries such places of indulgence are wont to offer, to make an appearance and growl that they are there for the People!
Again, there were the People who could not find a bus to go home, having come ready to lay siege to Colombo for days, at the behest of the organizers and left stranded till next morning (The milk packets not helping their cause, either). And then those people who at a snap of a finger could decide that it was curtain time and reach their mansions in Colombo in a matter of minutes.
The Constitution does not make any difference between these different types of people at all and the Jana Balaya promoters did not clarify as to the category to which people, who were supposed to show their strength, belonged.
If at all, it showed that we were so far away from being a modern or civilized people, despite all bravado that the entire universe revolves around Sri Lanka.

From Baiyo to Wahallu
Opponents of the Joint Opposition, used to employ the term baiyo to describe supporters of the former strongman and his clan, an allusion to the unqualified , blind and servitude like allegiance, nay adoration they have for the former.
After the Jana Balaya, now the detractors use the term, slanderously of course, wahallu or slaves to describe them.
Despite being generally averse to name calling, I feel, seeing those footages of the day, that such claims are not unfounded at all.
The Government is over the moon that the protest did not accomplish anything, other than perhaps inconveniencing the public, who flock to Colombo daily for their livelihood, education, business or pleasure.
The organizational shortcomings, which made it a flop has emboldened those Government chatterboxes to claim it a victory for them; well they can engage in that folly for another 1  years the most, if the status quo, with regard to political momentum, remained.
They cherish the scenes of drunken protesters climbing up lamp posts, doing devil dances and some flat on the pavements after getting high as kites.
They forget that those scenes seem a repeat telecast of scenes in such huge gatherings they organize themselves, i.e. May Day rallies.
The UNP has a proven track record of drawing people by enticing them with alcohol, rice packets and santhosam, which they prefer to forget conveniently.

Types of People
The crux of the matter lies elsewhere. When we talk of the people, whether it is the power of the people or the Government of the people, we need to make sure we are precise as to what type of people we are referring to.
If you do not make a distinction between those different types of people you end up misconceived in your perspective of many issues related to governance, rights and justice.
For example, who thought that when this Government came to office, claiming to serve the people and deliver them from the clutches of the former regime, that they were referring to those people, who dealt in billions and were used to the silver spoon
And again when the Rajapaksas say they want to come back to office back for the people , what they mean is those  people operating from VIP suits in seven star hotels and are adamant to stay away from the Special High Court or the State run hotel at Welikada
The constitution, folks, does not make any distinction; it is the brainchild of a brilliant, yet Neoliberal mind which was obsessed that the raw and unbridled power of market forces should dictate everything including who governs.
Woe unto those, who await any allowance from those quarters! More disturbing, however is that despite repeatedly being duped in 15 General Elections since Independence and seven Presidential Elections, WE, the People, have not realized the distinction.
The Jana Balaya, for me is not a pointer to the power of the Opposition or the future of the Government; rather it is yet another, repeatedly startling reminder that despite being handed down a representative democratic mode of governance by the Brits in 1948, we have never waded that phase of socioeconomic and political development, which classical political theory terms, the Serf System.
We need to realize that Jana Balaya, or the power of the people, could mean very different things, to different people who live worlds apart!
Until then, do not feel shy to enjoy the amusement the Constitution very freely offers us!
