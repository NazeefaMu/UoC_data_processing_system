Avant Garde press briefing called off
	
The special news conference scheduled to be held this morning by Avant Garde Maritime Services (Pvt.) Limited Chairman Major (Retd) Nissanka Senadhipathi to state their side of the controversy, had been postponed until further notice due to a sudden illness of its Chairman.
Secretary to the Chairman, Kamal Gamage said the news conference was organized to educate the media on the real facts referring to various information provided to the media and the general public on Avant Garde following the special meeting convened by President Maithripala Sirisena on Wednesday.
He said Major (Retd) Senadhipathi, who was to chair the conference underwent an abdominal surgery last month in Singapore and had been advised to an initial post surgery period of 41 days total bed rest and to avoid strenuous activities for three months.
?However, he was deprived of such rest as he was compelled to attend to certain commitments in business in Sri Lanka. His excessive schedule of work within the last few days had led to the development of a sudden pain and slight discharge from the post surgical area last evening and was recommended by his local physician not to move and to follow complete bed rest until further post surgical evaluations to be held in Singapore,? Mr. Gamage said.
He said that they would call upon the press briefing when Senadhipathi?s health condition improves.

Circular issued against adding sugar into tea
	
In a bid to control the sharp rise of people falling victims to diabetes, the Health Ministry has laid down regulations for tea shops, restaurants and state and private sector institutions to follow when serving tea, coffee and soft drinks.
Tea, coffee and milk served at state events such as workshops, meetings and functions should be prepared without sugar with a bowl of sugar and spoons? made available so that the guests could use sugar according to their preference, a circular issued by Health Services Director General Dr. Palitha Mahipala said.
A sticker should be in place with the warning, ?Less use of sugar prevents diabetes and other diseases.? These regulations are applicable to hotels, restaurants, and tea boutiques as well.
The circular states that the people and the medical staff should be made aware about the demerits of the excessive use of sugar that could cause Non Communicable Diseases (NCD). The selling and serving of food with excessive salt, excessive sugar and oily foods should be minimized in school canteens and food outlets.
The Health Ministry has recruited a number of Endocrinologists specialized in treating diabetes for the control of the disease.
The Health Ministry and the Non Communicable Disease Unit (NCDU) will launch a national awareness programme today to urge the public to use less sugar as a means of preventing diabetes which is increasing rapidly making it one of the main health problems in the country. (Sandun A Jayasekera)

The JVP was asked to be present in the Commercial High Court on November 27 to inquire into a claim made by the late Rohana Wijeweera's wife Chitrnaganie that the JVP re-printed and published seven books written by Mr. Wijeweera.
The order was issued by Commercial High Court Judge Shiran Gunaratne yesterday.
In her petition filed in the Commercial High Court Ms. Wijeweera claimed that the JVP leadership had printed seven books titled, ?Apa Mara Damuwada Apa Nagana Handa Sada Nomiyanu Etha?; ?Demela Eelam Aragalaya Visanduma Kumakda?; ?Ath Dakeem Kkihipayak?; ? Rata Hadana Ape prathipathiya?; ?Ratu Octobaraye Padama? and "Vietnam Viplavaya Araksha Karamu?. They were to be distributed during the ?Il Maha Viru Samaru? festival being held yesterday.
Ms. Wijeweera claimed that the JVP leadership had taken this arbitrary decision by violating the provisions of the Intellectual Property Act and as such to issue a permanent restraining order preventing the JVP from printing and distributing these books.

## Title: Lankan mother deemed a security threat, freed

Lankan mother deemed a security threat, freed
	
Ranjini, a Sri Lankan mother of three who has spent more than three years in detention after being deemed a national security threat by the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO), has been freed, Sydney Morning Herald said.
The Tamil refugee was given no reason why she was considered a security risk when she was whisked into detention in May 2012 - and was similarly given no explanation for her unannounced release on Thursday.
?She is very happy and extremely relieved," her lawyer, David Manne, said on Friday after Ranjini's first day of freedom included walking her two older boys, aged 9 and 11, to school.
Her third child, an Australian citizen, was born in detention after the pregnancy was confirmed two days after she was flown with her boys from Melbourne to Sydney's Villawood detention centre.
Ranjini was one of more than 50 Tamil Sri Lankans who were deemed security threats despite having refugee status and were then indefinitely detained. Most have since been quietly released without reason after their adverse security assessments were lifted.
Although Ranjini's husband Ganesh is an Australian citizen and she is recognised as a refugee, she does not know what visa she will be offered.
"She is looking forward to being able to rebuild her life with her husband and three boys with certainty of a safe future," Mr. Manne told Fairfax Media.
Ranjini, 36, whose first husband died in the Sri Lankan civil war, arrived on Christmas Island in April 2010 and spent time with her two boys in detention centres in Perth and Adelaide before being released into community detention in Brisbane in April 2011.
Her refugee status was recognised six months later. Then, with the apparent blessing of immigration officials, she married Ganesh, a Tamil refugee she met in Brisbane, moved to Melbourne and enrolled her two boys at Mill Park Primary before ASIO deemed her a security risk.
A High Court challenge to her indefinite detention found an error of law had been made in her case, but did not reopen the question of whether her indefinite detention was lawful.
Mr. Manne said the family had endured "profound distress" while she was in detention and she remained concerned about those whose adverse security assessments remained in force.
Trevor Grant, a convenor at the Tamil Refugee Council said: "We are overjoyed to see Ranjini released. I spoke to her by telephone last night and see was laughing and giggling so much it was hard to understand her.
"She has shown great courage and resilience, being forced to bring up three children behind bars for most of her time in Villawood. Her husband Ganesh has been equally strong. We are confident they will recover.
"But justice still has not been done. As the UN demanded more than two years ago, all these indefinitely detained refugees not only have to be released but also compensated. We will continue to campaign for this."
Mr. Grant said the incarceration of more than 50 ASIO-negative refugees, most of whom were Tamil, had been a stain on this country's democracy. "As far as we are concerned, it was part of a political stunt designed to scare off Tamil asylum-seekers," he said.

Suu Kyi's National League wins majority in Myanmar
	
The National League for Democracy has won a majority in Myanmar's historic general election ending decades of military-backed rule, the BBC said.
With more than 80% of seats declared, Aung San Suu Kyi's party has more than the two-thirds it needs to control parliament and choose the president. But a quarter of seats are allocated to the military, which means it will remain hugely influential.
Myanmar's constitution means Ms. Suu Kyi cannot now become president. It specifically bars anyone whose children were born foreign nationals from holding the job. Both her sons were born British. But Ms. Suu Kyi, a Nobel Peace Prize laureate who spent decades under military-imposed house arrest, has insisted she would lead the country anyway if her party won.
Sunday's election was the first openly contested poll in Myanmar in 25 years. It was widely seen as a fair vote though there were reports of irregularities, and hundreds of thousands of people - including the Muslim Rohingya minority, who are not recognised as citizens - were denied voting rights.
About 30 million people were eligible to vote and turnout was estimated at about 80%. The ruling military-backed Union Solidarity Development Party (USDP) - which won the last, widely criticised election five years ago - has so far gained about 5% of seats contested.

Video: Remove Wijeyadasa from portfolio: SF
	
Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka today urged the President and the Prime Minister to remove Justice Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe from his portfolio on the grounds that he was a disgrace to the principles of good governance.
He said the minister was covering up those involved in fraud and corruption contradicting the government?s pledges to take action against such offenders.
?Minister Rajapakshe is a disgrace to the government that was set up to bring about good governance. The President and the Prime Minister should make sure that he is removed from his portfolio before the victory gained on January 8 is ruined and justice ensured,? the Field Marshal said.
He said the minister was white-washing the Rajapaksas so that he could change sides in the future because he would not be able to win an election with UNP votes again.
The Field Marshal responding to the minister who coined the term ?Wel Vidane? in Sinhala for the rank of Field Marshal said it was not an insult to him but to the President who decorated him with that title.
Rejecting an allegation made by the minister that the Field Marshal collected a sum of Rs.2,000 million for the presidential election at which he contested, he said he received only Rs.250 million for the election and spent it for his election campaign.
Field Marshal said it was not the minister who helped him to enter politics as claimed by him but by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, Anura Kumara Dissanayake and some others.
?I saw the minister only after handing over my nominations. The minster says he gave me a dozens of national costumes. He came after me with a bag of national costumes but I did not take it and asked my security guard to take it feeling pity on him. But they were not of good quality or made to meassure,? he said.
Field Marshal Fonseka said if the minister had not taken money he earned as a politician, he should reveal how he earned money to construct huge buildings and live like a millionaire and added that he could not earn such a huge amount of money by working as a lawyer.
He said Rakna Lanka Chairman phoned him three days after the presidential election and offered to bear all cost of the Democratic Party for the general election but that he asked him to contribute it to construct an office for the party saying that he would not condone corruption.
?If he offered to help a minor party like us, we could imagine how he might have offered to help other parties,? the Field Marshal said.
He said 2,000 out of the 4,000 employees of the Rakna Lanka were army deserters who left the army illegally and were employed at low salaries with the protection of the then defense secretary.
The Field Marshal said investigations into the Avant Garde should continue despite its operations being taken over by the Si Lanka Navy. (Ajith Siriwardana)WATCH ?

UPFA MP Lohan Ratwatte said today the person who defeated the SLFP was the party chairman and as such the party could not win under the present chairman.
?SLFP supporters at grassroots level are not in favour of the present party chairman as he was the one who worked against the party and defeated it. I like to tell our supporters to be patient until the right opportunity comes,? he said.
He said the party should either remain in the opposition or in the government.
Mr. Ratwatte said the situation in the country was so complicated now and seems as if the war victory would be reversed. ?The LTTE is raising its head again. LTTE prisoners should not be released.? I?m completely against this move,? he said. (Nadeeka Dayaa Bandara)WATCH

Video: Spectacular breakup of WT1190F seen by team of Airborne Astronomers
	
Clouds hampered observations from the ground in Sri Lanka during the re-entry of WT1190F overnight, but a team of astronomers captured spectacular images of the object from a high-flying plane over the Indian Ocean very close to the predicted time of arrival.
The International Astronomical Center (IAC) and the United Arab Emirates Space Agency hosted a rapid response team to study the re-entry of what was almost certainly an old rocket stage. In an airplane window high above the clouds, the crew, which included Peter Jenniskens, Mike Koop and Jim Albers of the SETI Institute along with German, UK and United Arab Emirates astronomers, took still images, video and gathered high-resolution spectra of the breakup.
The group of seven astronomers hoped to study the WT1190F?s re-entry as a? test case for future asteroid entries as well as improve our understanding of space debris behavior. Photos and video show the object breaking up into multiple pieces in a swift but brief fireball. From the spectra, the team should be able to better determine the object?s nature ? whether natural or manmade.
