AIA Insurance Lanka March profit declines amid higher claims and expenses
	

AIA Insurance Lanka PLC (AIA), the local unit of Asia-based AIA Group Limited, reported earnings of Rs.71.2 million or Rs.2.32 a share for its March quarter 2017, a decline of 18 percent from a year ago as the company paid higher claims and benefits while the other expenses also rose.
The March quarter profit does not include the surplus on the life insurance business, which is done at the end of the financial year, post the actuarial valuation.
However, the Asia-based life insurer saw its gross written premiums (GWPs) rising by 11 percent to Rs.2.63 billion from
a year ago.
Sri Lankas life insurance penetration stands below 1.0 percent of the gross domestic product based on the GWPs and the business could face some headwinds from the current downturn in the economy as it bites into the disposable incomes of the people.
Life insurance is still not a necessity for the large majority of the Sri Lankans because of their lower disposable incomes as well as their attitude
towards risks.
Sri Lankas population is ageing fasta phenomenon which could become a major socio-economic issue for the country in the coming 25-30 years.  
AIA Insurance Lanka is the third largest life insurer in Sri Lanka based on GWPs.
The insurers investment incomes rose by 14.4 percent year-on-year (YoY) to Rs.1.27 billion, which could be attributed to the rising interest income because a section of the insurance assets are invested in government securities and corporate bonds.
The company paid Rs.1.42 billion in net claims and benefits, up from Rs.1.22 billion during the same
period last year.
AIA Group Limited, the third largest Asia-based insurer by market value, entered the Lankan market in December 2012 acquiring 92.7 percent of the then AVIVA NDB Insurance, in a deal valued at US $ 109 million.
In October 2015, the company divested its fully-owned general insurance subsidiary, AIA General Insurance Lanka Limited, to Janashakthi Insurance PLC for a consideration of Rs.3.2 billion to fully concentrate on the
life business.
As of March 31, 2017, the AIA group held a 97.16 percent stake in the company.

Crossing the Line in Sri Lanka
	
From Paranthan, the road to Vallipuram is rich and green. Great expanses of paddy stretch out before you, clumps of palmyrah dot the land and little streams of water trickle by. As we near the fighting, paddyfields give way to broken buildings and blasted vehicles. Twisted trees and uprooted trunks line the way. Everything is covered with a layer of brown dust. An occasional boat lies stranded on either side of the road, reminders of a last desperate attempt by the Tamil Tigers to hold back the tide. Blasting a reservoir in the path of the advancing Sri Lanka army, Tiger cadres counterattacked in boats, riding upon a wall of water. The water however, has receded and the Tigers have retreated.
As you enter the Kanishta High School, Vallipuram, the first thing you see is a brightly coloured board. Written at the top in vivid blue letters, is an inscription in Tamil.
Our students (Our Lifeblood ) ,
Those who Sacrificed their Lives
For the Freedom of this Land
Listed across the board are the names of the students of Kanishta High School who have died in the fighting. To make sure that their fellows do not forget, we are told where each student was from, what his LTTE code name was, when he died, where and in what operation.
The school is now occupied by the 58th Division of the Sri Lanka army. It is the first stop for those fleeing the fighting and they are brought here straight from the line.
A huge compound lies before us, lined on three sides by battered, ramshackle buildings. On one side are a set of classrooms, what was once the principals office is now a storeroom, piled high with sacks and boxes. On the left is a long low structure, open on every side and roofed with thatch. On the right is another series of buildings, now converted into kitchens and sleeping quarters. In the middle is a vast empty space, a small open tent at its centre. Nearby stands an ambulance, a Land Rover without wheels and two red buses. There is a roar of engines. The buses start up and trundle away.
At 8.45 am, the buses roll back in. Out stumble a ragged line of people, mostly women, children and old people. Tense and fearful, they look dazed and slightly lost. Most are drawn and dehydrated, many are clutching bottles of water. Nearly everybody is clinging onto bags and sacks, loaded with all their worldly goods. Their clothes are filthy, stained and spattered. Nearly all the children have sores and rashes. Strangely enough, there are very few young people, barely a handful out of 128.
The ambulance stands by, ready to rush the injured to hospital. The nearest hospital is Kilinochchi. Although the bunkers set up by the Tigers are still in place, it is now staffed by two civilian doctors and attendants. However, there are no wounded on this bus.
The IDPs are helped out of the bus by women soldiers, who lead them towards the long thatched area. While some wrestle with the bigger bags, the other women distribute biscuits, fruit drinks, bags of dates and sachets of glucose. The dates are for energy and the glucose is for dehydration.
Snatching at the biscuits, they tear at the wrapping, spooning the glucose into their mouths with their hands. Once they are seated a man in a yellow T-shirt begins an address in Tamil. They listen intently, wide eyed and open mouthed, wondering what is in store for them. There is hardly a murmur, even the children are quiet. Craning their necks to listen, they pause only to dip into their bags of food and guzzle water. Slowly they begin to nod their heads.
Once the address is over, we begin to hear their stories. Maria Kumari, a young woman of 29, had come all the way from Mannar, the north western tip of the island and ended up at Pudumathalan. She has both her two children with her, her three year old son Dinesh Kumar and her baby girl, Thireeshika. At first her eyes are closed and she just leans back against a chair. Gradually she begins to speak. As she talks, a smile lights up her fine features. For three days she has had no food, only gruel.
I was starving, my children were starving. Every day people are falling sick and people are dying, No food, no medicines, no water.
She had fled at night with her husband, wading across the Pudumathalan lagoon, the water chest high. Hearing the sound, the Tiger cadres had fired. So they remained where they were, waiting in the water till dawn. She stops talking to pour glucose down her throat. All I want now is to go home, to lead a normal life without fear.
By her side, an aged woman, gazes adoringly at a picture that she has been clutching from the moment she got down from the bus. It is a framed picture of the Baby Jesus and she had carried all the way from the Kilinochchi. It has been her protection, she tells us and it has saved me. Her name is Maria Poomani.
They wouldnt let us come, she said. They shot at us, as she remembered she kept touching the Baby Jesus with her fingers. The rest turned back but we threw ourselves onto the sand and crawled on our bellies.
An old man sat staring into space, a shawl over his head. Another man, heavier and burlier, nodded in agreement.
Why are you leaving us, they asked. They said that we will be imprisoned, killed and tortured.
We did not think we wouldbe treated so well.
In the adjoining partitions there are interviews taking place. It is here that the screening process begins. A man behind a desk asks questions. Everything is open and almost anyone can just walk in. Each individual and every family is registered and photographed. When the screening is over, everybody moves into the tent in the middle
Staggering soldiers drag in steaming cauldrons of dhal, rice and soya and there is a rush towards the food. The children are first in line, holding out their plastic plates to the women soldiers. Once everyone has finished, they board the bus again for the next stage of their journey. They would travel down the A-9 road to Omanthai, two and a half hours away. Omanthai is the last checkpoint controlled by the army, from here the IDPs would be handed over to the government.
Private Saman Kumari had been one of the three women soldiers who had got off the bus. Along with her friends, Minoshi and Tharaki, she had met the refugees at the line. They always come at first light, she said. We give them water and search them and check their bags. They are frightened and so are we.
The male soldiers search the men, we search the women. As women, we feel sorry that they have to take their clothes off. They are ashamed and we feel their shame. At first we did not search anybody, we used to bring everyone straight here. Then the
bomb happened.
There was one woman, she was about thirty. We had looked at her bags but we had not searched her body. She told us that she had lost her gold jewellery. She started crying and everyone gathered around to help. I left the other women soldiers with her and went to eat. Then we heard the sound. All we could see was smoke. People were screaming and there were pieces of flesh everywhere. She had strapped the bomb to her stomach.
Before we used to pick up the children and carry them. We used to carry their bags.
Now we know. Even a small child can carry a bomb. Now we search everyone. Now we watch everyone. Some of the women dont want to take their clothes off. So we tell them, you are women and so are we.
We felt so sad. We did so much. But we cannot fight, so this is all we can do for
our country.
From Vallipuram the buses speed through the rolling savannah of Sri Lankas Vanni region. Once the heartland of Tamil Eelam, now it is an empty landscape dotted with army posts. At 3.30 in the afternoon we arrive at Omanthai, the last checkpoint in the army controlled zone. Once the border post for leaving and entering Tamil Eelam, Omanthai consists of a series of parking areas and open sheds. Here the IDPs bags are searched again and their possessions itemized. They are questioned, their identities checked and they are registered and issued with cards.
Everyone is seated on the ground. As the shadows begin to lengthen, a young man in a T-shirt and a baseball cap begins to speak. His tone is reassuring.
We know that the Voice of Tigers Radio have told you that your men will be killed and your women raped. No one will be taken away. None of you will be sent to prison. Our war is with your leaders, not you. You have been taken by force and kept by force. If you have any connections with the LTTE come forward and tell us now.
Nothing will happen to you. But tell us now before somebody else does.
When you go to the camps, there will be people who know you. Tell us now, so that we can trust you. If you dont we will suspect you.
When he had finished speaking, almost everybody got up and moved to another spot. A small knot seated themselves in another group. There were five men and two girls. Amongst them I recognized some of those whom I had seen in the morning. They had been slightly apart, sitting on their own with strained, intense expressions. All were young and in good physical shape. They were all much better dressed than the others, some of their clothes were almost fresh.
They were questioned one by one under the trees, their interrogators, smiling young men in jeans and T-shirts. Their manner was casual and friendly. As they talked, the cadres began to relax; the tautness gradually leaving their faces. There were smiles and even laughter. It seemed more like a social gathering, a picnic in the open air. The questions are gentle
but probing.
We were not allowed to ask their names or take their picture. One girl had brightly gilded earrings, which glinted in the afternoon light. She wore a long brown dress and her hair was tied up. She was 24 years old, a member of the Sodhiya regiment, one of the crack female fighting brigades. We asked her why she
had joined.
I joined because I left school early and stayed at home. My mother was angry with me and used to beat me. I joined to make her angry.
She had left her husband behind. As she spoke, tears glistened in her eyes. He was seized by the LTTE. I am very worried for him. Her leaders had told her that she must kill all Sinhalese. I did not expect to be treated like this, she said. They have lied to us.
We asked if she was still frightened. Smiling, she cocked her head and looked at us coquettishly. Whom should I be frightened of 
Her words were echoed by a thin, wiry young man with buffed hair and shaved sideburns. We were taught that we would be tortured. It was in my mind. Unlike the others, he still had a closed, hidden expression on his face. He had signed up straight from school. He told us that he was a member of the computer wing and that he had joined for the salary.
Squatting on the ground, their families waited anxiously. The children were not crying now, they were playing with the sand. The same burly man I had spoken to earlier, told us that it was the first time he had seen a biscuit in several months. At Pudumatalan the beach had been their toilet, men and women squatting together in the sea, as many as fifty at a time. Relatives who had managed to get away had spoken to them by telephone. They told us that we would not be punished. That is why we are here. All I want to do now is to bathe.
Once the questions were over, the cadres were photographed against a spreading tree. When everything was finished, they picked up their bags and walked towards their families. I had thought that they would be treated as prisoners of war, so did they.
In the sheds on the other side queues were forming. Every item was checked and rechecked. An old man tapped me on the shoulder, do you work here  Pointing to a big bandage on his ear, he asked in Tamil, where can I go to get some more medicine.
The final registration process took place in another shed, longer and lower than the rest. Long lines of tables run the length of the building, manned by women soldiers and a few policemen. Details were checked and noted and they were given cards and numbers. The silent tension had given way to animated gestures and a rising din. Clutching their newly issued cards, they handed over their numbers before climbing aboard the waiting bus.
By 5.45 everything was nearly over. As the sun began to set, the last bus started up. It would be the fourth and final stage of the journey, down the A-9 to Vavuniya. Their final destination would be the camps run by the government. They were now the concern of the civil administration.
As the engines rumbled, an old woman was doing her best to clamber on to the running board. Hauling herself up, she turned to berate a brawny soldier struggling with her numerous bags. Everybody grinned and looked away.
In less than 24 hours Sri Lankas IDPs would have crossed three sets of lines.

Fight Cancer initiative launched in Maharagama Vision of transforming care experience of every can
	
The Fight Cancer initiative is an ambitious programme launched with the vision of transforming the care experience of every cancer patient treated at the National Cancer Institute (NCI) in Maharagama.
The initiative comprising 130 members continue to assist victims of the deadly disease in hopes of raising funds to develop the National Cancer Institute in Maharagama into a primary cancer care institute capable of comprehensive care for each and every patient that comes through its gates. 
Cancer is a single word used to refer to over one hundred diverse diseases. With ever increasing studies and treatment methods on diseases that have no cure, the burden cancer poses on caregivers is certainly unimaginable. Being diagnosed with cancer will most certainly have an effect on the mentality of the patient and a more severe impact on caregivers including medical practitioners. The Fight Cancer initiative strives to assist such numerous burdened families as well as the very institute that cares for their ailing family members. 
NCI is the leading hospital under the Ministry of Health dedicated to the diagnosis and follow-up treatment of cancer patients. It is the only such hospital in the island which offers both diagnostic facilities necessary for the identification of all types of cancer, and specialised care in surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy. 
Their specialized consultants and a staff of over 1000 including nurses, pharmacists, medical physicists, laboratory technicians and minor workers provide healthcare services around the clock to the neediest of patients. Despite their dedicated services however, the hospital is overwhelmed with the increasing number of patients each year. Sources reveal that the number of patients who seek clinical care at the Maharagama hospital falls between 1000 to 1500 per day. While the hospital has a bed strength of 1500, it still struggles to afford treatment to all those who seek the immaculate care provided by the staff. 
At the 139th meeting of the Fight Cancer team held this week, founder of Kadhijah Foundation M. S. H. Mohamed which spearheaded efforts to purchase a PET scanner for the hospital voiced the needs of the hospital. 
On March 4, 2015 the fundraiser to purchase the PET scanner for this hospital was launched. Rs. 200 million was raised within three months with over 7000 donors. The PET scanner was a dire need for the Maharagama hospital, as it was the only specialised hospital available to the public. The other cancer units spread around the country are only wards attached to bigger hospitals.  Even with such dedicated services available here, there are many shortcomings in the hospital, he said. 
When questioned about the progress of the installation of the PET scanner, Mohammed said that all measures were underway to install the machine at the hospital premises. We have raised Rs. 252 million which was more than the required amount. Because of this the members of our team were encouraged to carry forward with out fundraising efforts to help the hospital obtain more facilities, he said. 
We have successfully raised enough funds to purchase one important machine for the hospital. Even though the process is delayed it is being implemented. The Ministry of Health initiated construction for a building to house the PET scanner. We expect that a bidder will be selected and we will receive the machine within three to four months, he added. 
According to Mohammed the hospital is also in need of a Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scanner instrumental in mapping out treatments once a cancer patient is diagnosed. 
Doctors often rely on MRI scan imaging results to determine treatments, such as surgery or radiation therapy. 
The hospital currently does not have a MRI scanner. A single MRI scan can cost around Rs. 40,000 when performed at a private hospital. The other hospitals which possess scanners have waiting lists spanning for months. This is the sad reality for most cancer patients around the country. Therefore our next goal is to raise funds to purchase an MRI scanner for the Maharagama hospital, Mohammed clarified. 
The founder of the charity did not fail to mention that there were number of areas in the hospital that needs assistance. The hospital is only equipped with a CT scanner which has been installed almost 15 years ago. It is outdated and it is only an analog scanner. Modern cancer treatment uses digital CT scanning facilities which are more precise. Therefore, we will also attempt to raise funds for a new CT scanner. Among the groups ambitious goals are the establishment of a genetic lab at the hospital and also to provide free lodging for the families of patients at the hospital. The Fight Cancer group insists that their compassionate journey of healing the victims of cancer will not stop and seeks assistance of generous donors to assist them in their noble efforts.

Govt. has turned back on public who voted for them: IUSF
	
Overruling the opinion of the majority, the present unity government was continuing the former regimes agenda of privatizing state education and the health sector, the Inter University Students' Federation (IUSF) said yesterday.
Addressing the media following a major protest in front of the Viharamahadevi Park, IUSF Convener said the government was making the same mistake as the former regime however in a more speedy and arbitrary manner.
The Government is carrying out its own agenda with regard to the South Asia Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM) by ignoring public opinion. It has also betrayed the mandate given by the general public who was voted for them. Hundreds of students who represent those innocent people are behind this protest and therefore the government should not ignore us, he said.
Further, he said the police around ten students, including a female student, were admitted to hospital due to the governments actions.(Thilanka Kanakarathna)

Gunmen attack state TV station in Afghanistan
	
REUTERS, 17th MAY, 2017- Gunmen attacked a building of Afghan state television in the eastern city of Jalalabad on Wednesday and engaged in a gun battle with security forces, the provincial governors spokesman said.
We can confirm that a number of insurgents have entered the building, said Attaullah Khughyani. Who they are, and what their target is, is still not clear.
He said there appeared to have been at least three attackers, two of whom had blown themselves up while at least one was still fighting.
Heavy gunfire could be heard from around the building of RTA, Afghanistans national broadcaster, located close to the provincial governors compound.
Jalalabad is the capital of Nangarhar, the eastern province on the border with Pakistan where Islamic State fighters have established a stronghold, but there is also a strong Taliban presence in the region.
Insurgents fighting to oust the Western-backed government in Kabul have conducted a series of high-profile attacks this year on targets including Afghanistans largest military hospital and a military base in the northern city of Mazar-i-Sharif.

HNB relocates to spacious new Ratnapura customer centre
	
HNB Deputy General Manager SME Jude Fernando opens the new customer centre together with HNB Assistant General Manager Network Management Nirosh Perera, Kandalanda Tea Factory Partner Chandana Mithsen, Balangoda Plantions MD/CEO Lalith Obeysekera, Additional District Sectary Ratnapura Dayananda Colombagama and HNB Ratnapura Manager Waruna Samarakoon

Catering to the rapid growth in commercial and retail banking activity in the area, Sri Lankas premier private commercial bank, HNB PLC, officially opened its newly relocated Ratnapura customer centre at No: 9, Senanayake Mawatha, Ratnapura.
Designed to provide customers a new paradigm in banking convenience, HNBs state-of-the-art Ratnapura customer centre offers a complete spectrum of banking products and services including automated cheque deposits, real-time transactions and digital account opening facilities.
Additionally, customers can also benefit from HNBs extensive range of benefits and advisory services offered under the Priority Circle plan at the newly opened customer centre, which will be open from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. on weekdays and weekends 9:00 a.m. to
1:00 p.m.
Serving as the chief guest at the event, HNB Deputy General Manager SME Jude Fernando made special mention of the unique relationship HNB had developed with the businesses and retail customers in the town.
Historically, HNB has long played a dynamic role in enabling economic growth across the Ratnapura area. Since the establishment of our first branch over 43 years ago, we have partnered with a wide variety of businesses, entrepreneurs and SMEs in the region, spanning gems to plantations and it has been a distinct privilege for HNB to have supported these businesses and empowered them to grow from humble beginnings into powerful companies that are even able to compete in international markets.
Recounting some of the rich history built into the HNBs presence in the Ratnapura region, Fernando explained how in 1974, HNBs Ratnapura customer centre began the practice of weekend banking, driven solely through the hard work of the bank manager, who at the time lived in the same premises above the bank branch itself and who would personally accommodate urgent banking needs of customers and businesses in the area, which would thereafter be validated at the start of the work week.
Given that Ratnapura serves as a vital hub for regional commerce, HNB, under the visionary leadership of former HNB Chairman Rienzie T. Wijetilleke, had identified the region for special development and that legacy has continued into the present day where we are now able to offer the best, most cutting-edge digital services in the market, complemented by highly personalized service delivery, including our comprehensive Priority Circle service offering, Fernando elaborated.
In that context, he also thanked HNBs loyal customers for their patronage over the years and requested people to make a visit to enjoy the personalized service and unparalleled diverse range of products which only HNB can offer.
Operating across 252 customer centres islandwide, HNB PLC is Sri Lankas largest retail bank. The bank continues to play a vital and energizing role in the Sri Lankan economy and has been declared the best retail bank in the country for nine years to date.

JO member and MP S.M. Chandrasena told a news conference that in the alternative the NCP Governor should accept the affidavits submitted by 17 NCP councillors who have pledged their support to the joint opposition and are calling for the removal of Chief Minister Jayaratne.
The government should take to appoint a new chief minister. The refusal by the NCP Governor to accept these affidavits is a violation of the Constitution, he said.
Meanwhile, JO member G.L. Peiris said the appointment of new ministers to the NCPC was merely an attempt to safeguard the government's balance of power. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)

Ironwood Investment announces mandatory offer on Abans Finance
	
Ironwood Investment Holding (Pvt.) Ltd, a unit of private equity firm Ironwood Capital Partners, yesterday announced a mandatory offer to purchase all the remaining shares of Abans Finance PLC.
The mandatory offer was announced at Rs.25 per share. However, the Abans Finance share is now trading around Rs.35-36 levels.
The move comes in the wake of Ironwood Investments increasing its stake in Abans Finance to 31.89 percent and triggering the Securities and Exchange Commissions Take-overs and Mergers Code.
Ironwood recently acquired 10.16 million Abans Finance shares or 15.25 percent for Rs.25 each through a rights issue, increasing its stake in the company to 31.89 percent. Prior to the rights issue, Ironwood held 11.07 million shares or 19.95 percent of Abans Finance. The rights issue, which raised Rs.277.34 million, was intended to improve AFSLs future minimum capital adequacy requirements. A market source said that Abans Finance parent Abans PLC, which held 71.60 percent of shares in its subsidiary prior to the rights issue, may not have subscribed to its full allotment of rights, allowing Ironwood to buy extra rights.

JVP condemns attack on IUSF
	
The Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) today condemned the teargas and baton charge carried out by the police on the university students who were engaged in a protest march organised by the Inter University Student Federation (IUSF).
Addressing a press conference, JVP General Secretary Tilvin Silva said the IUSF students did not engaged in a fight with the government or the police, but only held a peaceful protest for a very reasonable demand.
The government treated them as criminals and attacked them in inhuman manner. Around 20 students were injured and another ten were taken into custody. We condemn the governments attack on those who engaged in a reasonable struggle, he said.
He also requested the government to release the arrested students unconditionally.
Further, he said the political parties including JVP, many trade unions, doctors, parents and students started an anti-SAITM struggle as it was a money spinning institution.
He said without listening to the public the government attempts to safeguard SAITM and suppress the public opinion using the law suits power.
We dont have any issues with SAITM. All these efforts to close down the institution as it is a step towards selling the state education. That is why it should be defeated, he said.
He said time to time the government is suppressing the public opinion in different ways and taking interim orders to carry out attack on people. This clearly shows the violation of the rule of law of this country.
Therefore, the authorities should stop suppressing the public and to resolve the issues amicably through discussions. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

Madras HC adjourns Rajiv killer Murugan's plea to meet his mother
	
The Madras High Court on Wednesday adjourned a plea of V Sriharan alias Murugan, one of the seven life convicts in the Rajiv Gandhi assassination case, seeking permission to meet his mother in prison. He had sought permission to meet his mother, who has come from Sri Lanka on April 2, on any day between May 22 and May 27.
A vacation bench of Justices R Mahadevan and M Govindaraj refused to entertain and adjourned the petition of Murugan, after summer vacation.
When the matter came up, Additional Public Prosecutor Govindaraj said permission cannot be given to the prisoner as he was caught using the mobile phone inside the prison recently.
The petitioner submitted that as a punishment for his misconduct, the Superintendent of Central Prison Vellore, as per the prison manual, had withdrawn the privilege of meeting even his wife Nalini, another life convict in the case, for about 30 minutes for every 15 days and any visitors for three months.
Even his aged mother, who had come from Sri Lanka on April 2 to meet him in the prison between April 11 and 18, was not allowed to meet him, he added. He said he had made a representation through the Superintendent of Central Prison, Vellore to ADGP and IG of Prisons at Egmore, Chennai to suspend the punishment to enable him to see his mother when she visits the prison. He sought a court direction to the authorities to consider his plea and permit him to meet his mother, whose visa is due to expire by the end of this month, on any date between May 22 and 27.
Rajiv Gandhi was killed by a suicide bomber at nearby Sriperumbudur on May 21, 1991 and seven persons  Murugan, Santhan, Perarivalan, Nalini, Robert Payas, Jayakumar and Ravichandran  were convicted in the case. (DNA India)

Pramudith D. Rupasinghe Behind the Eclipse, An Ebola Survivors Journey Through Life
	
Life is a battle, which one has to fight even when in the jaws of defeat and one cant be selfish to give it up, as it is for those whom we love and care for.
Not many of us are aware of the struggles of a survivor of Ebola, nor do we know of the stigma attached to patients who have suffered and survived the disease. Being a psychologist by profession and a mental health specialist who acted in response to the disease, Pramudith Rupasinghe was able to penetrate the inner thoughts of both the Ebola patients and survivors. He listened to their stories and difficulties and one which attracted him was the story of Thumba. Meeting Thumba inspired Rupasinghe to dive into this semi-fictional novel, where he describes the struggles the protagonist went through, while at the same time adding a literary, fictitious factor to it. Rupasinghe hides Thumbas true identity in the book by using a different name in order to protect his privacy. 
Set in West Africa, the book follows Thumbas journey as he matures into an adolescent whilst living with a tribe and then being displaced in the city. He finds religion and becomes a nurse, treating Ebola patients and subsequently contracting the disease and surviving it. The book reveals that African tribes living in the forests in the late 1900s were exposed to the optimum conditions for the Ebola disease and many had died after showing symptoms very similar to the disease, however this has not been documented. The book further explores the hierarchical system in place in such tribes and their way of life. Furthermore, it shows the transformation of Thumbas tribal mindset. The book also highlights the spread of Ebola. The reader bears witness to the struggle of treating an Ebola patient to the suffering of one, after which we are shown the irony of survival as they too must suffer with the ostracism that comes from being an Ebola survivor. 
Rupasinghe visited 29 countries within the African continent, which has helped him gain experience and valuable knowledge on the forests and culture of various areas. As a psychologist who was also working in the peace corporations department with the UN, I had to study medical anthropology,
specifically in the African context. It was imperative for me to know about the social fabric of where I was working, to help with my work. So I always observed and studied the social and cultural aspect of the place I was in. As a result of this, being in Liberia for five years and mingling and conversing with different types of people, especially in the context of crisis resolution, I learned about the different customs of more than 60 tribes. I also read a lot, because to write you also need to read. He further said that he had travelled by vehicle through many forests in Africa, which is how he was able to gather more information for his books. 
Rupasinghe said the book would go a global tour, across 20 countries It is to raise awareness on the fight against the stigma against Ebola survivors and their family members. It has been translated into many languages, including Sinhala and Tamil. By writing this book, there is pressure not only to do justice to the protagonist and his life but also towards those who have undergone the same experience. The main objective of this book is to be used as a tool for humanitarian advocacy, a tool to fight the battle against stigma as it is the most difficult thing to fight and overcome. This book is about self discovery, its about recovery and resilience, we all have battles to fight in life and that is what I have portrayed here. 
Both the Sinhalese translation and the low-cost reprint of the book Behind the Eclipse will be available in Sri Lanka at all book retailers from May 18 onward.

Rupee ends lower on importer dollar demand
	
REUTERS: The Sri Lankan rupee ended weaker yesterday led by usual importer dollar demand, but dealers said depreciation pressure on the currency has eased on strong inflows from foreign borrowings.
Rupee forwards were active, with spot-next forwards ending at 152.85/90 per dollar, compared with Tuesdays close of 152.70/80.
One-week forwards ended at 152.95/153.00 per dollar, compared with Tuesdays close of 152.90/153.00. We see usual day-to-day importer dollar demand. The depreciation pressure has eased since the sovereign loan came in, but we do not see any intervention by the Central Bank, a currency dealer said asking not to be named.
The dollar supply is used by importers unless there is a huge import bill. The Central Bank intervenes by just directing the market through adjusting the spot reference rate. The market is now determining the exchange rate unlike in the past. The spot rupee did not trade yesterday. The Central Bank fixed the spot rupee reference rate at 152.50 on May 5.
Central Bank Governor Indrajit Coomaraswamy said last week that the monetary authority did not want to allow the rupee to fall too quickly, but suggested further weakness in the exchange rate was on the cards as policymakers sought a competitive currency. The downward adjustment to the spot currency was to make the rupee more competitive, he added.
The Central Bank has allowed the currency to gradually depreciate since mid-December, revising its spot reference rate multiple times.
Sri Lanka regained a lucrative European Union trade concession with effect from Friday, but the market shrugged off the decision, with analysts saying they were waiting to see the real impact of the facility. Sri Lanka received US $ 1.5 billion last week from a 10-year sovereign bond, while another US $ 450 million from a syndicated loan is expected soon.

REUTERS: Sri Lankan shares ended at their highest level in over a year as foreign investors continued to buy blue chips after an annual trade concession worth US $300 million from the European Union (EU) added fuel to a rally that started towards the end of March.
Index heavyweight John Keells Holdings Plc ended almost one percent higher on foreign buying. The benchmark index has risen nearly 11 percent since March 31.
The EU on Tuesday said Sri Lanka has regained a lucrative trade concession, mainly for its top exports garments.
The Colombo stock index ended 0.39 percent firmer at 6,718.34, its highest close since Jan. 8, 2016.
Turnover stood at Rs.1.75 billion well above this years daily average of Rs.899.5 million.
Foreign interest is continuing in blue chips, said Atchuthan Srirangan, a senior research analyst at First Capital Holdings PLC.
Foreign investors net bought shares worth Rs.902.6 million, extending the year-to-date net foreign inflows to Rs.18 billion.
Reduction of 11-38 basis points in T-bill yields in the last four weeks, stable currency on expectation of inflows from foreign borrowing, and an IMF statement on the disbursement of the third tranche of a US $1.5 billion loan, have helped boost sentiment, analysts said.
Shares in Ceylon Cold Stores PLC rose 4.4 percent while Ceylon Tobacco Company Plc rose 1.4 percent and John Keells Holdings Plc gained 0.9 percent.

Should MPs with dual citizenship be allowed to remain in politics
	
The Court of Appeal earlier this month ruled that United Peoples Freedom Alliance (UPFA) Galle District MP Geetha Kumarasinghe cannot hold a Parliamentary post as she is a dual citizenship holder. An undefied Geetha Kumarasinghe subsequently filed an appeal at the Supreme Court challenging the verdict of the Court of Appeal. The actress turned politician, who was elected to Parliament in August 2015 was unseated, as the Appeal Court held that M/s Kumarasinghe was not qualified to contest the August 2015 parliamentary elections because at the time she held dual citizenship, violating provisions of the 19th amendment to the Constitution.  According to Article 92 (b) and Clause 20 (4) of the 19th Amendment, and Article 91(1)(d)(xiii) of the Constitution, persons who are dual citizens are disqualified from being elected as Members of Parliament or the President of the Republic. The Constitution specifies that - No person shall be qualified to be elected as a Member of Parliament or to sit and vote in Parliament if;(d) (xiii) a citizen of Sri Lanka who is also a citizen of any other country Following the announcement of the Appeal Court decision, Secretary General of Parliament informed the Elections Commission that Kumarasinghe had been removed from her post as a parliamentarian from the Galle District in line with the Court of Appeal verdict.  However, the Supreme Court has temporarily stayed the Appeal Court order against her, thus allowing her to continue her in post as an MP. The Supreme Court hearing is to be resumed on September 25. As the dual citizenship of politicians has become one of the hot topics, the Daily Mirror tried to contact a number of politicians including ministers in the current government and MPs from the Opposition who enjoyed dual citizenship to find out what their stance say on the issue. Some of the politicians are of the view that the court ruling must be applicable to all members of parliament who are allegedly in possession ofdual citizenship.

It is immoral for a politician to be a dual citizen,
- Mahinda Samarasinghe UPFA MP
Skills Development and Vocational Training Minister Mahinda Samaraweera said he personally believed that its immoral for a politician to be a dual citizen because a person has to pledge to uphold the Constitution of another country. The Minister said this when he was questioned by the journalists at a recent press conference whether he held dual citizenship. 
Minister Samarasinghe said he was one of Sri Lankan legislators who continued to defend the country at UNHRC sessions in Geneva by opposing the stance taken on Sri Lanka by other countries including the US. 
If I was a citizen of such a country, how could I have protected Sri Lanka How can I raise my voice against those countries I was able to function independently because I had no dual citizenship. Im 61 years old now and never in my life have thought of applying for dual-citizenship, the minister said.

Instructed the Immigration Department to compile the list of MPs with dual citizenship
- S.B. Nawinne, Minister ofInternal Affairs 
The Daily Mirror spoke to Internal Affairs Minister, S.B. Nawinne with regard to a request made to release the list of MPs with dual citizenship. The minister said that he has instructed the Department of Immigration and Emigration to compile a list of MPs with dual citizenship. We have not launched an investigation. There was talk among parliamentarians that some of the MPs were dual citizens. In the meantime the Department of Immigration and Emigration had received a request for a list of names of parliamentarians who were dual citizens. Accordingly, I have instructed the relevant officials to compile the list and respond to the request, the Minister clarified. 

It is reported that Pivithuru Hela Urumaya (PHU) General Secretary MP Udaya Gammanpila has submitted a request to the Department of Immigration and Emigration for a list of names confirming as to which parliamentarians were dual citizens. 

We have applied for termination of Kumar Gunaratnams Australian citizenship in order to gain Sri Lankas citizenship,
-Duminda Nagamuwa - Politburo Member FSP
Politburo Member of the Frontline Socialist Party (FSP) Duminda Nagamuwa said, at the end of the day, the focus should be made on the nature of the politic of the legislator and not their citizenship. He said the reasons to apply for dual-citizenship could be varied on different grounds but regardless, the fact of dual citizenship should not become a barrier for someone to engage in politics following their self-conscience. 
If a politician from the left camp applies for dual citizenship of another country, thats usually because he or she cant engage in politics in his home country. Dr. N.M. Perera left for India and engaged in left politics there. However, if a politician from the capitalist camp applies for dual-citizenship, its mostly for personal privileges. What matters is the nature of politics, he said. He also didnt forget to mention that they were against invasive policies of some of the foreign embassies in Colombo. 
Commenting on the matter pertaining to politburo member of FSP Kumar Gunaratnam, who was sentenced to one years imprisonment for violating visa regulations by the Kegalle Magistrate on March 31, 2016 and released on December 02, 2016, Nagamuwa clarified Gunaratnam was not a dual citizenship holder. 
He held the citizenship of Australia. We have applied for termination of that citizenship in order to gain Sri Lankas citizenship, he said. 


Politicians with dual citizenship should not conceal who they are:
- Dullas Alahapperuma UPFA MP
Matara District UPFA MP Dullas Alahapperuma also the National Organiser of the Joint Opposition, said if a dual citizen MP conceals the fact that he or she is a dual citizen it is a violation of the Constitution. 
The MP stated if the Constitution says that a dual-citizens cannot contest the General Elections and become an MP, any such person shouldnt conceal the fact that he or she is in fact dual citizen. If anyone is doing that, it is an act against the State. There is no issue in taking action against them, he said.

Trump pressured Comey to end Flynn probe
	

By Devlin Barrett, Ellen Nakashima and Matt Zapotosky May 16 at 8:08 PM 
President Trump asked the FBI to drop its probe into former national security adviser Michael Flynn and urged former FBI director James B. Comey instead to pursue reporters in leak cases, according to associates of Comey who have seen private notes he wrote recounting the conversation. 
According to the notes written by Comey following a February meeting with the president, Trump brought up the counterintelligence investigation into Flynn and urged Comey to drop the probe in the wake of the national security advisers resignation. 
The conversation between Trump and Comey took place after a national security meeting. The president asked to speak privately to the FBI director, and the others left the room, according to the Comey associates, who, like other officials, spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to reveal internal discussions. 
I hope you can let this go, Trump said, according to the Comey notes, which were described by the associates. Comeys written account of the meeting is two pages long and highly detailed, the associates said. The conversation described in the notes raises new questions about whether Trump may have crossed any legal lines into criminal behaviour by pressuring the FBI to end an investigation. 
The revelation also marks the second major challenge for the White House this week, coming just a day after a report in The Washington Post that the president disclosed highly classified information to Russian diplomats during a private meeting last week at the White House.

Vehicles imported by MPs, Ministers cost a mere Rs.7.5mn each: Daya Gamage
	
Refuting the allegations that parliamentarians and Cabinet ministers imported vehicles worth at least Rs.45 million each, Primary Industries Minister Daya Gamage said today the cost of such vehicles did not exceed Rs.7.5 million each when imported under the vehicle permits granted to them.
Addressing a news conference held at Sirikotha recently, Minister Gamage said most of the ministers used their permits to import common vehicles such as Toyota Land Cruisers which cost about 50,000 USD each.
Even Minister Sarath Fonseka imported a vehicle worth Rs.7.5 million recently. No one ever imported a single vehicle worth Rs.45 million. However, when importing vehicles, more than a whopping Rs.45 million has to be paid as duty. Every parliamentarian has the right to use a vehicle for their ministerial work. Sometimes, a vehicle is needed to maintain the status of a minister. The funds to purchase these vehicles are given by their respective ministries. The rest should be paid as Customs duty. Once Rs.7.5 million is paid, the rest of the amount will be debited to the Treasury, he said. (Chaturanga Pradeep)

Several United National Party (UNP) MPs yesterday threatened to take stern action if the anticipated cabinet reshuffle puts the government off the track.
UNP Puttalam District MP Asoka Priyantha told a media briefing that the cabinet reshuffle should not be aimed at fulfilling ulterior motives of few who had joined this government by accepting positions even after they were defeated at the last general election.
We will not leave the government but will see to it that our voices are heard in Parliament if the cabinet reshuffle is done to fulfill the aspirations of few defeated politicians, he said.
We the members of the government are the ones who made sacristies to elect this government and we are making sacrifices even now. However we cant afford to keep quiet if the government is moving off the track, he added.
Mr Priyantha said what was needed was not a cabinet reshuffle but the fulfillment of the pledges given by this government.
He said the cabinet reshuffle should not create any divisions within the UNP.
