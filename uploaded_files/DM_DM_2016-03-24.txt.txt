Court restrains Suhada Koka DVD sale
	
The Colombo District Court today restrained till April 7 the printing and selling of DVD copies of the popular comedy film 'Suhada Koka'.
Court made this order on film producer Sunil T. Fernando considering the submissions of the petitioner's counsel and perusing the documents filed by the DVD film's present patent right owner Rukman Samanpriya of Ja- Ela.
Counsel Shabdika Wellapuli appearing with Kelum Maitreepala for the petitioner said the petitioner had purchased the patent right to produce and sell DVD copies of the film Suhada Koka  from its former owner one Raj who had purchased the patent right from Ravindra Guruge.
The Counsel said Ravindra Guruge had purchased the patent right from the producer of the film Sunil T. Fernando.
However Sunil T. Fernando after transferring the patent right to a second party was now attempting to print DVD copies of the film for commercial purposes.
The Counsel contended that if the defendant printed and distributed copies of the film, it would cause an irreparable loss to the plaintiff. (T.Farook Thajudeen)

Crosstalk between Ranil, Udaya over Hanuman Bridge issue
	
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and Opposition MP Udaya Gammanpila engaged in crosstalk in Parliament yesterday when an issue relating to the Hanuman Bridge between India and Sri Lanka came up for debate.
The Premier pointed out that Sri Lankans were unaware of the statements made by Indian Minister of Road Transport Nitin Gadkari in the Lok Sabha regarding the said matter.
He said Minister Gadkaris speech was recorded in the Lok Sabha Hansard in Hindi and no one would be able to understand it, and added that Sri Lanka and India had not held any discussion on the issue thus far.
This explanation by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe took a different direction when he subsequently, sarcastically questioned Mr. Gammanpila on his knowledge on Hindi language.
Mr. Gammanpila who then reacted, ironically asked the Premier if the local government had taken any measures to express displeasure on the statements made by the Indian Minister, if the concerns pointed out were false.
In response, Mr. Wickremesinghe said it would be a costly and difficult exercise as it would be necessary to hire interpreters who were conversant in both English and Hindi. (Yohan Perera)

Human trafficking racket busted in Maradana
	
Foreign Employment Bureau (FEB) officials and the police yesterday busted a human trafficking network and rescued ten victims including six teenage girls, who were forcibly detained for more than six months.
Three sub-agents were arrested during the raid on several lodges in Maradana.
Those rescued had come to the sub-agents seeking job opportunities in Middle Eastern countries.
Preliminary investigations had revealed that the sub-agents had arranged forged travel documents for the victims and promised to send them for Middle Eastern countries through the Mattala Rajapaksa International Airport (MRIA).
FEB sources said some of girls were between the ages of 17 and 20 and residents of Empilipitiya, Monaragala and Deniyaya.
Three suspects who pretended to be sub-agents of the FEB had been arrested and investigations are ongoing to arrest the main suspect in the human trafficking racket. He is said to be a resident of Akkaraipattu in Ampara.
The arrested sub-agents are residents of Maradana.
The women and the men have been forcibly detained for more than six months in several lodges located in Maradana. They had made payments to the suspects on the promise that they will be sent to the Middle East as housemaids. Forged passports had also been arranged by the suspects. They had made arrangements to send them abroad on visit visas. "A woman aged 40 was also among those rescued, an official of the Foreign Employment Bureau said.
The Bureau's Investigation Department is expected to record statements from those resuced.

Japan likely to invest in a coal-fired power project: Harsha
	
Japan is expected to invest in a coal power project in Sri Lanka which was provided 600 megawatts of electricity to the national grid, a Deputy Foreign Affairs Minister Harsha de Silva said yesterday.
He is currently visiting Japan on the invitation of the Japanese Government and told Daily Mirror by phone that it would be a high efficiency coal-fired power generation project.
The deputy minister said the Japanese investment would be in addition to the proposed coal-fired project in Sampur on a joint venture with India.
However, he said he could not provide further details on the proposed project with Japan.
We have to identify a suitable location for the project, he said.
In January, Japan agreed with India to support the introduction of high-efficiency coal-fired power generation and renewable energy technology.
The deputy minister said Japan would invest heavily in the development of urban transportation in Sri Lanka.
It is actually urban mass transportation. I cannot give exact details at the moment. In addition Japan will invest in the airport expansion project. Japan which has a positive attitude towards Sri Lanka will provide funding in a manner that will not be a burdan to the Sri Lankan Government, he said.
The Norochcholai Coal-Fired power plant located in Puttalam generates 900 megawatts of electricity. (Kelum Bandara)

Judge sternly warns Dhammika
	

Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA) Chairman Dhammika Ranatunga was released on bail by the Colombo Chief Magistrate Court today over the alleged incident of threatening a journalist at the Colombo High Court premises.
On March 17, Colombo Chief Magistrate Gihan Pilapitiya noticed Mr. Ranatunga to appear in Court following a B Report filed by Keselwatte Police over the alleged incident.
On March 16, Mr. Ranatunga arrived at the premises to attend the hearing for the bail application revision for his brother Nishantha Ranatunga and had allegedly threatened the journalists present, when they captured visuals of him entering the court.
The journalists, representing several media outlets, captured Ranatungas threats on camera and later lodged a Police complaint at the Keselwatte Police.
Nishantha Ranatunga, former CSN Senior Executive, was remanded on charges of violating the Public Property Act.
While releasing the suspect, Dhammika Ranatunga, the Colombo Chief Magistrate told him that Court could understand how he worked at the Ports Authority if his behaviour in Court premises was such.
The Magistrate also asked the Keselwatte Police why they didn't record a statement from the suspect on his arrival to the Police after the complaint was lodged.
The Magistrate also questioned as to why the Police had provided special privileges to the suspect, since the suspect had arrived to the Police subsequent to the complaint in his private vehicle and had left without giving a statement over the incident.
However, the case was moved to the mediation and postponed to July 28. (Shehan Chamika Silva)

Legislation to regulate massage clinics
	
The Health Ministry was in the process of introducing legislation to regulate and monitor Massage Clinics and Health Clubs in order to prevent nefarious activities allegedly carried out at these locations, Director General, Health Services Dr. Palitha Mahipala said.
We are aware of certain abominable acts taking place at these parlours putting the health of the public at risk and that is why the Health Ministry decided to monitor and regulate these places, Dr. Mahipala said.
Addressing the media at the seminar for journalists at the Health Education Bureau (HEB) titled AIDS  myths and beleaves' he added that the proposed Act was being drafted by the Legal Draftsman right now.
Responding to a journalist at the seminar Dr. Mahipala said the Health Ministry receives public complaints regularly on illegal acts taking place at massage clinics.
The police keeps a watchful eye on these places and the raids conducted on them prove that a majority of massage clinics are illegal sex clubs or houses of ill fame. Many of these massage clinics are manned by Thai, Ukraine and Indonesian sex workers which put the health of Sri Lankans at risk.
Dr. Mahipala said the monitoring and regulating of massage clinics was timely as the spread of sexually transmitted diseases and HIV/AIDS in particular are on the rise.(Sandun A Jayasekera)

Questions over NWP Question papers
	
One of the questions in the multiple choice question paper (MCP) for the Buddhism subject set by the North Western Province Education Department for the first term test in schools have been criticized by the public and education sector trade unions for its incongruous answers.
The Sri Lanka Teachers Union said for example question No.20 in the Buddhism question paper for Grade 10 contained a multiple choice question to name the great ruler who saved the country from foreign invaders and got the book of his meritorious deeds read while lying on his death bed and breathed his last glancing at the Cheithiya built by him.
The four optional answers were; 1. Former President Mahinda Rajapaska, 2. First Executive President J.R.Jayawardene 3. King Dutugemunu, and 4. King Parakramabahu the Great.
The trade union accused the examiners of insulting the former heads of state through that ridiculous question. They questioned as to why the Buddhism question paper contained only 20 questions while the Christianity question paper contained 40 questions.
A representative of the Ceylon Teachers Union said the date of examination for Information Science had not been mentioned in the time table.
However Director of Education, North Western Province J.G.S.Tilakaratne said he had not yet received any complaint in this regard. He said the question papers were printed at the State Printing Corporation and that that any errors in them could have been printing mistakes. (Pushpakumara Jayarante)

Referendum: Kiwis vote to keep current flag
	
Kiwis have voted to keep their existing flag after a national referendum. The existing New Zealand's national flag won 56.6 per cent of the vote, compared to 43.2 per cent for the silver fern flag.
The total number of votes received was 2,124,507 - a turnout of 67.3 per cent, the New Zealand Herald reported today.

Prime Minister John Key says he is disappointed with the flag result and that the National Government will not revisit the issue under his leadership.
Mr. Key, speaking to reporters at Auckland Airport this evening, said that he respected New Zealand's choice of flag.
He took some positives from the result, pointing out that nearly 1 million people will have voted for change by the time the final results came in.
Mr. Key also defended the process, saying it was lengthy and considered.
Asked whether the referendum process had been worth $26 million given it led to no change, he said it had sparked an "enormous", healthy debate across the country. "You can't shy away from a debate or a discussion about nationhood," he said.
Just because the referendum did not produce the outcome he wanted "doesn't mean it wasn't a worthwhile process".
"We ... as a country had a nationwide discussion about our flag, about nationhood, about what we stand for," Mr. Key said.
"And I think that's been an important discussion we not only should have had, but must always have.
"I don't think we should shy away from ... contentious issues just because they are by nature contentious."
Mr. Key said he would now be supporting the current flag.

We deported suspected Brussels bomber: Turkey
	
Turkish officials said Wednesday the country previously deported one of the suspected Brussels bombers, and authorities pressed the search for at least one other suspect in the deadly attack.
Belgium's chief prosecutor Frederic Van Leeuw earlier identified two brothers, Khalid and Ibrahim El Bakraoui, as suspected suicide bombers in the rush-hour attacks, which killed 31 people and injured at least 270. Ibrahim, 29, blew himself up at the city's Zaventem Airport, while Khalid, 27, detonated an explosive in the metro system, authorities said.
The so-called Islamic State claimed responsibility for the bombings, which came four days after police arrested Salah Abdeslam, a suspect in last year's Paris terror attacks, in Brussels. Tuesday's bombings rocked Belgium's capital and prompted reviews of security at airports and public transportation hubs around the world.
Authorities searched for 24-year-old Najim Laachraoui, who police sources named as a possible suspect, NBC News reported. It was not clear whether he was one of three men in an airport surveillance photo showing suspects.
Multiple reports Wednesday said Laachraoui, a suspected bombmaker in the Paris attacks, was the other airport suicide bomber. NBC News has not been able to confirm those reports. (cnbc)
