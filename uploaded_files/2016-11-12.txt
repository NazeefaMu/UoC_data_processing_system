Attack on disabled soldiers: Action against policemen: PM
	
Action will be taken against the police personnel who attacked the disabled soldiers during the recent protest in Colombo, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe told Parliament yesterday.
He was responding to a question asked by joint opposition MP Dinesh Gunawardane.
The Prime Minister said investigations would also be carried out to find out who had manipulated or prompted disabled soldiers to act in the manner they did.
He said the disabled soldiers had continued their protest even after the Government had made arrangements to grant their demands and added that the participation of a Buddhist monk at the protest was also questionable. (Yohan Perera)

District Judge visits Duminda in prisons hospital
	
A District Judge has gone to the Welikada Prisons hospital on Thursday (10) night to visit former Parliamentarian Duminda Silva who was convicted in the Bharatha Lakshman Premachandra murder case and spent some time before leaving, a prison spokesman said.
Two days after the conviction Duminda Silva was admitted to the prison hospital after he caught fever and there was also an arrangement to send him to the Sri Jayawardenapura Hospital on the recommendation of doctors, he said.
It is also said this judge had come to the prison on the day Duminda Silva was convicted and her entry to the prison had also been registered in the documents at the gate of the Welikada Prison.
When inquired about the matter Prisons Commissioner General Nishan Danasinghe affirmed the arrival of a judge on Thursday to see convicted Duminda Silva at the prisons hospital.
The Commissioner General also said he had directed the chief medical officer of the prisons hospital to submit a report explaining the transfer of Duminda Silva to the National Hospital recommended on the ground of a sudden illness instead of recommending the Sri Jayawardenapura Hospital.

Fishermen issue: India, SL should work out a win-win situation: Mangala
	
Sri Lankan Foreign Minister Mangala Samaraweera on Friday said India realised the dangers of bottom-trawling, but the two countries should work out a win-win situation for poor fishermen on both sides of the Palk Bay.
??I am sure that we should be able to come to a suitable agreement in the shortest possible time,? said the Minister, who in September called for a ban on bottom-trawling, citing its adverse impact on marine ecosystems.
Terming the New Delhi meeting ?a great success,? he told The Hindu in an interview that both sides demonstrated political will to find a solution and that a ?very important first step? has been taken.
On the outcome of the U.S. elections, he said there were certain concerns about some of the policies Donald Trump expounded during the campaign. But ?what you say at election time is not always what you do when you are elected?. The American system, he said, would steer the new administration along the same path as far as international relations are concerned.
Asked about the recent controversial remarks of the Chinese envoy in Colombo ? criticising at a press conference Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake?s view on ?expensive? Chinese loans ? Mr. Samaraweera said he advised the envoy that any such issue should be sorted through the Foreign Ministry rather than through the media. China is a ?good friend? and an important partner in Sri Lanka?s economic development, he said.
Mr. Samaraweera, a top leader in Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe?s United National Party, which leads Sri Lanka?s unity government along with the Sri Lanka Freedom Party, has been at the helm of initiatives aimed at reconciliation.
Asked about concerns voiced by the civil society on the draft of Sri Lanka?s new counter-terrorism law, he said his own Ministry had conveyed to an oversight committee its reservation over some of the recommendations in the draft. The final version, he said, would be in line with global norms. ?But still the commitment of the government to repeal the earlier Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA) and introduce a new Prevention of Terrorism Act in keeping with international best practice is as strong as ever.?

Police to investigate Keith Vaz over alleged drug offences
	
Police are investigating suspected drug offences after allegations were made against the former chair of the influential home affairs select committee, Keith Vaz, who is known for his campaign for the Sri Lankan Tamil force, the Guardian reported.
A Sunday Mirror article on 4 September this year said he had paid male escorts and had been secretly recorded offering to pay for cocaine if it was brought to a future meeting, though he stressed that he did not want any himself.
He was also accused of encouraging others to use poppers. The select committee he formerly chaired has criticised moves to ban the legal high and has investigated prostitution, leading to accusations of a conflict of interest.
After the article was published, Vaz apologised to his family for his actions but attacked the paper for the way it had gone about getting the story. He stepped down from his home affairs select committee position two days after the news emerged.
Police said they received a letter the next day ? 7 September ? asking them to investigate. The correspondence was passed on to a specialist team, which ?started an assessment process to identify what criminal offences ? if any ? may have been committed?.
On Friday night Scotland Yard said: ?Following that assessment, which included obtaining early investigative advice from the Crown Prosecution Service, the Metropolitan police service is now investigating offences under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971. The investigation started on Thursday 10 November.?
Police confirmed the investigation was launched following allegations against an MP in the 4 September edition of the Sunday Mirror but refused to identify any of the objectives of the investigation and declined to comment further.
On Friday Vaz said: ?I welcome a full investigation as a means of establishing the true facts and I am confident the police will pursue all lines of enquiry. I will cooperate with the investigation in any way I can.?
It was announced at the end of last month that Vaz had been appointed to the justice committee, despite opposition in parliament.
Conservative MP Andrew Bridgen told the Commons: ?I would leave the house with this question: If the right honourable member for Leicester East [Vaz] found himself last month to be not fit to be chair of the home affairs select committee and the matters are unresolved, what makes him think that he is a fit and proper person this month??

?Supermoon? on November 14
	
The planetarium in Colombo has planned to present the moon?s closest encounter with Earth in over 68 years, which is called the ?Supermoon?, on November 14, 2016.
The full moon on November 14, 2016, will feature the closest full moon until November 25, 2034.
On November 14, at perigee, the moon can come as close as 356,509 km to Earth. On average, the distance from Earth to the moon is 384,400 km. A perigee full moon can be as much as 14% larger and 30% brighter than the full moon at apogee.
The point when the moon is closest to the Earth each month is called perigee and the point when it swings farthest away is called apogee.
When the full moon falls on the same day as the perigee, the moon in the sky appears larger and brighter than usual, creating a ?Supermoon.?
?There are three full moons in 2016 that meet the definition of a supermoon ? October, November and December. But November 14th full moon is the most superior,? the planetarium said.
It said this natural phenomenon can be observed around 7.30 p.m. on November 14, 2016.
