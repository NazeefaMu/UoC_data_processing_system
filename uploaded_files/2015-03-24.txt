19A requires referendum: Nimal
	
Referring to the 19th Amendment, Opposition Leader Nimal Siripala de Silva said the government appeared to have introduced some constitutional provisions which warrant approval by people at a referendum.
Soon after the Prime Minister presented the Bill, Mr. de Silva said the government initially pledged to introduce constitutional amendments to be enacted in Parliament with a special majority, without resorting to a referendum.
He said it was now apparent that the government had deviated from this pledge and introduced certain provisions that warrant a referendum.
"The government should be prepared to face any such eventuality. Certain clauses of the bill overlap each other," Mr. de Silva said and urged the Prime Minister to introduce legislation to enact electoral reforms simultaneously with the constitutional reforms.
"We are for the enactment of both as part of the same exercise," he said.
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said it was a matter for the Supreme Court to determine, as several applications had already been submitted to the SC on the Bill.
He said the Attorney General had been consulted on this matter.(KB & YP)

19th Amendment in parliament
	
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe today presented the 19th Amendment to the Constitution seeking to hold the Executive Presidency accountable to the Legislature and the Judiciary.
The Bill presented in Parliament will be taken up debate on date agreed by party leaders.
According to the new proposals, the President is the Head of the State, the Head of the Executive and the Government and will be the Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces. The new Bill restricts the president?s term of office for five years. ?
The promotion of ethnic and religious harmony, national reconciliation and the creation of proper conditions for the conduct of free and fair elections are among the duties assigned to the President.
The Bill also provides for the President to make policy statements in Parliament and to preside at ceremonial sittings of the House.
A Constitutional Council, chaired by the Speaker, is proposed to be appointed through this Bill. The Prime Minister, the Opposition Leader, a person appointed by the President, five officials appointed by the President on the nomination of the Prime Minister and the Opposition Leader and a nominee of the minor and minority parties will be its members.
According to the proposed amendment, the President appoints the Prime Minister. The total number of cabinet ministers will be limited to 30 while the total number of deputy ministers and state ministers should not exceed 40.
The President cannot dissolve Parliament till the completion of four years and six months of its term. Or else, there should be a request by Parliament through a resolution calling for the dissolution of parliament.(KB & YP)

Audio: BBS challenges Maithri to prove wrongdoings
	
	Bodu Bala Sena (BBS), General Secretary Ven. Galagodaatte Gnanasara Thera today challenged President Maithripala Sirisena to prove whether the BBS had harmed the Muslim community.
	The Thera threw this challenge sequent to a statement made by the President who was accompanied by Central Provincial Councillor Azath Sally during an official visit to London that the BBS was responsible for intimidating the Muslim community.
	While criticising the statement the Thera said he would disrobe and work as a servant for the President. ?If the President cannot find any wrong doings by us, he must come and serve me as an acolyte,? he said. ?
	The Thera said during this ?secret? discussion held with the Muslim community in London, the President had said the BBS had threatened Muslims and as such they had voted for him at the presidential election.
	?The three armed forces are now under the President, still the executive powers are with him, and so he should be able look into any hindrance to the Muslim Community caused by the BBS. If there is evidence to prove any wrong doings by the BBS then I will dissolve the organisation within an hour and work for president Sirisena as a servant or the President should serve me as an acolyte in this temple,? the Thera said.
	He said these remarks would give wings to the false statement published against the BBS on foreign media because it was the President who had made the remarks this time.
	??In the President?s 100 day programme, there is no room to discuss the concerns of the Sinhala Community. We should expect this kind of situation after appointing puppet as President. Therefore, the BBS has to come up and discuss these issues. Even Jathika Hela Urumaya (JHU) didn?t talk of these issues in parliament,? the Thera said. (Chaturanga Pradeep)

Extend local councils by one year: UPFA
	
United People?s Freedom Alliance (UPFA) today urged the Minister of Local Government and Provincial Councils to provide a year?s extension to local councils whose term expires on March 31 and to hold elections under the new electoral system.
UPFA General Secretary Susil Premajayantha said the demarcation should be gazetted during that time allowing the Elections Department to hold elections under the new system and ensure representative democracy at the Local Government level.
He said the term of office of 234 local councils would end on March 31 this year and stressed the need to give priority for the proposed electoral system and added that the elections commissioner needed more time to prepare for the election as the demarcation of electorates was yet to be gazetted.
Mr. Premajayantha said the subject minister could extend the term of the local councils comprising of Municipal Councils, Urban Councils and Pradeshiya Sabhas by one year under the provisions of the Local Government Act and added that elections had been postponed on several previous occasions as well.
He said the majority of local government bodies were under the control of UPFA and said the support of the local government members were needed to complete the development work that had been already started.
Another 70 local councils would end its term in August this year.(Ajith Siriwardana)

Colombo orders release of 54 fishermen
	
The Sri Lankan government on Monday ordered the release of the 54 Indian fishermen arrested early Sunday by the Navy on charges of poaching.
The decision comes a day ahead of the scheduled third round of talks between fisher leaders from India and Sri Lanka, to be held in Chennai. The 10 trawlers seized, however, were being held by Sri Lanka, sources in Jaffna said.
On Monday, fishermen in Rameswaram launched an indefinite strike demanding the release of the fishermen, news reports said.
Meanwhile, Tamil Nadu has agreed to hold the talks based on the guarantee given by the Sri Lankan government that fishermen would be released after being produced before the courts on Tuesday morning. (The Hindu)

Video: MR given security which he did not provide Chandrika
	
Cabinet spokesman and Minister Rajitha Senaratne today said that former President Mahinda Rajapaksa had been provided with comprehensive security which included 21 vehicles and 213 officers.
Contradicting the claim of President Rajapaksa who recently said that his security was decreased, Senaratne detailed the security provided to Rajapaksa.
?He didn?t provide any security to his predecessor Chandrika Bandaranaike and she had to go to the Supreme Court to get her security. According to the guidelines set out by the Court a former President was only to be provided with a fixed number of vehicles. But we have gone beyond that and given him maximum security? he told journalists at the cabinet Press Briefing.
Senaratne further said that it was laughable that former President Rajapaksa is complaining about his security after being provided with 213 personnel which included 108 soldiers.
Responding a question by a journalist, Minister Senarathne said that in the event Mr. Rajapaksa was elected to Parliament through the General Elections, he would lose his privileges given to a former president. (Darshana Sanjeewa)

Ratgama PS Chairman shot dead
	
	Ratgama Pradeshiya Sabha Chairman Manoj Mendis is reported to have been shot dead by some yet unidentified assailants at a tourist hotel in Wewala at Hikkaduwa on last night.
	Two others who were with Mr. Mendis at the time were seriously injured in the shooting.? They were rushed to the Karapitiya Hospital but the Chairman had died on admission. One of the injured, in a critical condition had admitted to the ICU and the other injured was admitted to the ward No. 6 for further treatments.
	Police said the preliminary investigations at the crime scene had revealed that the assailants had most probably used an automatic weapon in the shooting.
	A senior police official said the Chairman had been a suspect in several cases pending in the Balapitiya and the Galle Magistrate?s Courts in connection politically motivated killings and other unruly incidents during the election campaign.
	He said it was too early to say who might have carried out the killing and the motive for it. The Police officer said the detectives would also focus attention on sand mining disputes in Molaoya in Totagamuwa and in Ratgama as being a possible motive.
	The Police officer said none of the eye witnesses seemed to be prepared to give evidence and this was an obstacle to the ongoing investigations.
	The Police did not receive any information about the incident but suspected that the shooting was done by a pistol before the gang fled the scene.
	Five police teams including those from Galle, Rathgama, Hikkaduwa and Aluthgama have been deployed together with intelligence in search of four suspects.
	Hikkaduwa police are conducting further investigations. (Chaturanga Pradeep)

19A a ?Constitutional Coup?-JHU
	
The 19th Amendment presented in Parliament by the Government was a result of a ?Constitutional Coup? to allow a person who is unable to win at an election to retain power, the Jathika Hela Urumaya (JHU) said today.
JHU General Secretary and Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka said the objective of the latest reforms was to render the Executive President powerless and to make the Prime Minister powerful.
?The people elected President Maithripala Sirisena with a mandate to curb the arbitrary powers of the Presidency and not to make the Prime Minister the Head of the Government nor allow Parliament to override the Executive. The Prime Minister can be made the Head of the Government only if approved at a referendum,? he told a news conference held at the Party Head Office in Battaramulla.
Claiming that the constitutional reforms included in the 19th Amendment were done in a hurry, he vowed to garner the support of other political parties and defeat the 19th Amendment in its present form. (Lahiru Pothmulla)
