an open way of caring & sharing with the less fortunate. and spreading  a bit of Hope
	
           An open day, an open heart        
For the busy housewife who visits the Jathika Pola regularly she may be unaware that just down this same road by the side of the canal is a Centre that has been in operation for the last thirty years or so. The Centre supports persons affected by leprosy most of whom are already disabled because of the disease and are shunned by society, even ostracized by their own families, because of the shame and stigma attached to leprosy.
In the early biblical days leprosy-affected persons were not allowed to be seen in public and had to announce their presence by ringing a bell so that others could stay out of their way  some considered it a curse from the gods. This myth was however dismissed by Jesus Christ when he touched lepers and healed them of their affliction

Most of these persons are too old, weak or disabled to work and depend on the kindness of loved ones for their sustenance and eagerly look forward to the monthly stipend that Surol doles out to them.
It is with this same love and compassion for persons considered unworthy and untouchable by society that SUROL has reached out to, in a very humane and commendable way
The Society for the Upliftment and Rehabilitation of Leprosy Affected Persons (SUROL) a registered charity was founded in 1971 and nurtured to what it is today due to the selfless and dedicated work carried out by the late Rev Fr. Glen Fernando. Today SUROL continues his legacy with the same dedication and commitment and supports leprosy affected persons irrespective of their caste, creed or colour - Sinhalese, Tamils, Muslims, Buddhists, Hindus, Christians are all served with the same spoon with no discrimination or difference.
Recently, the SUROL Centre in Narahenpita was a hive of activity when an Open Day was held for these affected persons from the Colombo district who gathered at SUROL to share their life experiences. Some of them came in hired tuk tuks because of their disabilities and SUROL reimbursed their travel costs. Most of these persons are too old, weak or disabled to work and depend on the kindness of loved ones for their sustenance and eagerly look forward to the monthly stipend that SUROL doles out to them.
78 year old B.N. Premadasa is from Panadura and lives with his family.
They said that SUROL gifts them with two hampers each year, one during the National New Year and the other at Christmas, consisting of dry rations, provisions, a towel, sarong/material, bed sheet plus a cash gift that brings a bit of cheer to their otherwise dreary and painful lives.

Presently SUROL can only look after about 300 families due to financial constraints and invite the public to contribute towards this very deserving and humanitarian cause by calling their hotline 11 2503263 or by email tosurol1971@gmail.com or by visiting their website www.surolsrilanka.org
Field Officers Terrence and Saman can identify each and every person by face and name in every district in the country that SUROL supports and together with Accounts Officer Niranka were mainly instrumental in organizing this Open Day. They were seen chatting enthusiastically with those present whilst serving them with tea, refreshments and lunch together with the other staff Bala and Selvaraj.
SUROL is able to carry out this mercy mission only because of the benevolence of donors and patrons who have come forward to sponsor one or more families affected by leprosy. SUROL also organizes fund raising ventures to supplement contributions and have set themselves a target of trying to support 500 such families.

At least 20 dead as twin blasts hit Kabul
	

KABUL REUTERS Sept 5 2018-A suicide attack at a wrestling club in a Shiite neighbourhood of the Afghan capital Kabul and a second explosion apparently targeting emergency services and journalists killed at least 20 people and wounded 70 on Wednesday, officials said. There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack in Dasht-e-Barchi, home to many members of the mainly Shiite Muslim Hazara ethnic minority which has been targeted in the past by Sunni militants of Islamic State.
Last month, dozens of students preparing for a university entrance examination were killed at an educational centre in the area.
Kabul police spokesman Hashmat Stanekzai said the second explosion hit as police were helping victims and a number of journalists were at the site.

By scooter to Sevenagala The Ceylon Scooter Club (CSC) started with four  members  and now has  a la
	
Imagine forty scooters racing up the hairpin bends of Kalawana and villagers staring in varying stages of wonder at this unusual multi-coloured motoring phenomenon. Theyd been at it since the early hours of Saturday, gathering for the Ceylon Scooter Clubs annual outing  this time titled the Sevanagala Jumbo Safari because the destination is close to the elephant sanctuary of Udawalawe.
The Ceylon Scooter Club (CSC) started with four members and now has a large membership and a very efficient set of young organisers. Though the event started two hours behind schedule  at eight a.m., the journey was memorable due to the untiring efforts of the organisers.
The CSC employed several teams to manage the event, to direct traffic, and attend to breakdowns. Four members carried walkie-talkies in case mobile phones became useless along some stretches due to lack of signals. The leading team comprised Dhanuka Nalinda and Tharuka Dabarera who had reconnoitered the
route earlier. 
A separate video team (Sanka Ruwan Wickremasinghe, Tanuj Wickremasuriya and Charith Paranawithana) accompanied the riders, video filming the trip using a drone. Back up vehicles carried first aid, spare parts, the luggage of some of the participants and family members. Without such attention to detail, this kind of trip could end in total chaos. Kasun and Chamari, the husband-and-wife team behind the You Tube channel Travel With Wife, rode with us on a scooter, filming the event.
Bajaj
The youngest of these classic scooters date from the 1990s. The majority were Bajajs. The oldest was an orange 1952 Vespa in exemplary condition. But all these machines are ridden hard, and minor repairs are essential along the way. The clubs own mechanic, L. R. S. Nishantha, accompanied the riders; but quite a few of them are competent mechanics themselves, capable of doing anything from repairing brakes or a carburetor to dismantling and repairing an engine. 
The members come from all walks of life. There are company executives, businessmen, one architectural designer, mechanics and blue collar workers. I am easily the oldest rider out of the lot; most of them look half my age or less.
My blue Vespa, usually a trouble-free machine, suffered a few hiccups this time  the silencer became noisy due to a loose pipe, and the gear cable broke as we climbed the steep hills of Rakwana. But help was at hand within minutes. There were many helping hands for the silencer  firstly by two fellow riders, Asantha and Prasad, and finally by our pathfinder Dhanuka Nalinda, helped by Mithun who was carrying his bongo drum tied to the back of his scooter! 
Though the allotted time for each breakdown was15 minutes, more time was spent as everyone stopped by the stalled rider for a chat. This sets a pattern  leisurely stops for regrouping, or photos, and then speedy stretches as if to make up for the lost time. Though careful instructions were given at the start about road discipline, all caution seemed to be thrown to the wind as riders started moving.
Though the allotted time for each breakdown was15 minutes, more time was spent as everyone stopped by the stalled rider for a chat
Leading the way were the Kodukarayo group with their elaborate long hair, beards and flamboyantly decorated scooters. If ever there was a misnomer, this is it: Kodukarayo means beginners, but these people ride like daredevils. Overtaking at breakneck speed, standing up while riding fast, and a devil-may-care attitude and scorn for all other traffic is typical of them (CSC members have formed their own sub-groups, such as Kodukarayo and Vandanakarayo. We were to meet some of the latter, returning from their own trip, during thefinal evening).
Joys and terrors of riding
The road surfaces ranged from good macadam to moonscapes. After having breakfast at Ingiriya, we passed some lovely scenery along Dumbara Road. By 11.30, we were clear of the bad stretch and moving past Ayagama to Kalawana, where we stopped for fuel. Starting again at 2 pm., we entered a land where it was misty, dreamy and another world, a sharp climb and equally sharp descent, often at what seemed to me like breakneck speed. My gear cable snapped while climbing, but help came immediately and Nishantha replaced it quickly.
Lunch was late and before you knew it, it was dark and my headlight wasnt working. I tagged behind one of our guides and focused on his tail light as I was completely blinded by the oncoming traffic. We arrived at our destination, the camping site at Sevenagala, at eight pm; which was not too bad, considering the late start and all the stops. It was windy and peaceful and too dark to see the Kiriibbanweva Lake. As you wandered around, the talk was about scooters, near misses and the joys and terrors of riding. The peace was pierced by a cacophonic DJ, but the mood was now for relaxation and revelry. Dinner was late (around midnight) but for those who drink, the night got off to asplendid start.
Uninformed about the late dinner, I thought there was none and settled for the barbecue, helping myself to a couple of tank fish looking big in their silver wrappings. The man in charge gave me a mean look as I walked away, as if hed have liked to skewer me and roll me over the charcoal. The soft-boiled fish melted in my mouth. It didnt fill me up, but put me in a pleasant, somnambulant state where I could retire into my tent and drift off amidst the din, a bevy of colourful scooters roaring around inmy head.
Morning next day was heavenly. The breeze blew strong across the lake to where we were. There were two kayaks and lifejackets available for those in the mood. I crossed the lake on one with a friend. After that, it was blissful to read a book after bathing in the lake as lunch and departure
time approached. 
Committee
Some journeys you want to remember, some you want to forget. This one was unforgettable. A word of thanks here for the 10 member CSCs organising committee which comprised Kelum Chandrashan, Janithra, Arjun Rupasinghe and Amal Rajapakse, who worked tirelessly before and during the event to make it a success. Never have I seen such dedication, motivation and togetherness in a Sri Lankan enterprise with entirely non-profit aims. 
The return journey was shorter, avoiding the hills, via Ratnapura and the High Level Road. After dark, the six volts lighting was helpful (someone having fixed my headlight that morning) only when there wasnt any oncoming traffic. The serpentine stretches through rubber forests after Ratnapura remained hallucinatory in my memory. A long row of scooters, outlined eerily against the shadowy landscape, gliding through the night, turning and banking in unison with their glowing tail lights. 
Close to Colombo, the group split up to go their own ways. I had company all the way home. A final wave, a handshake, and a promise to meet at the next round.

Dialogue from 09-14 September in New Delhi  Indo-Sri Lanka Relations
	
It is reported that India has invited a multi-party parliamentary delegation from Sri Lanka for a familiarization tour and also to discuss mutual matters. This step taken by the Indian Government led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi should be regarded as a step taken in the right direction taking into consideration the inter-connected bilateral social and political problems faced by the two countries. India is our immediate neighbour and its representatives had come here to help us on various critical occasions in the history of our island, when our island state was threatened by use of arms by our misguided youth in recent history.
A well equipped battalion of Indian Armed Forces were here in 1971 on the invitation of the Sri Lankan government ready to help the country at large when an insurrection took place under the initiative of the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna. This insurrection was targeted to topple the coalition government that was elected by the people eleven or twelve months before, with the backing of the working class movement, organized trade union movement and also by the peasantry.
Lal Bahadur Shashtri, the then Indian Prime Minister who maintained fraternal relations with Sri Lanka, absorbed 520,000 of estate labour as citizens of India. Later, Kachchaitivu also came as a donation to Sri Lanka.
The series of meetings that will be taking place in Delhi, between Sri Lankan and Indian leaders from September 9-14, will open the door to discuss several mutual and regional matters
Then came the second insurrection, which developed into a large scale war in South East Asia well organized and launched by the LTTE, and also cooperated by various foreign elements. However, during a critical stage of the war, on the invitation of the Sri Lankan government the IPKF came here, on the orders of Rajiv Gandhi, the then Prime Minister of India. It should be noted here with gratitude that thousands of Indian soldiers sacrificed their valuable lives to safeguard the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Mother Sri Lanka. As a result of this generosity, India, lost a precious life, that of Rajiv Gandhi, the grandson of epoch-making Jawarharlal Nehru and son of magnificent Indira Gandhi.
Whatever the tragic instances of the past and unwise attitude taken by some of the south Indian politicians, New Delhi and Colombo have maintained friendly relations throughout the long period of our history. Even the left leaders of our country, who were followed by the British secret agents during the second world war, preferred India to safeguard their own lives. The revolutionary Indian comrades looked after them very well.
The illustrious Foreign Secretary of India, Romesh Bhandari advised New Delhi throughout his diplomatic career to look into the problems of Sri Lanka, from a point of view of New Delhi and not to be a partner of other sinister objectives, that would harm the interests of its immediate neighbour.
Under the wise leadership of former President Mahinda Rajapakse and the war efforts well coordinated by his commanders and also due to the active support extended by international players, including India, Sri Lanka was able to eradicate LTTE terrorism from the soil of Sri Lanka. It is the considered view of some war experts, that the elimination of the LTTE terrorism from the soil of Sri Lanka, has also benefited India in the long-run.
A well equipped battalion of Indian Armed Forces were here in 1971 on the invitation of the Sri Lankan government ready to help the country at large when an insurrection took place under the initiative of the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna
In this positive background, the series of meetings that will be taking place in Delhi, between Sri Lankan and Indian leaders from September 9-14, will open the door to discuss several mutual and regional matters, including bilateral trade agreements, problems within the SAARC region, suggested defence agreements, strategic engagements with other foreign powers, proposed new constitution for Sri Lanka, problems arising from the 13th Amendment, home grown solution for Sri Lanka, and so forth.
The vast and rich experience possessed by the two countries during the last seven to eight decades in handling various issues of this nature, should help both parties to find workable solutions, safeguarding the traditional relationships and fraternity of both countries.
I would like to end this essay, with the lucid statement made by Shivshankar Menon, the former Indian Foreign Secretary in his well-illustrated thesis-CHOICES-INSIDE THE MAKING OF INDIAS FOREIGN POLICY- But no matter what one might think of its internal politics, Sri Lanka today is a better place without the LTTE and the civil war. And India contributed to making that outcome possible.

Ex-military officers diplomatic service more immense than others: Gota
	
The service rendered by retired military officers as Sri Lankas envoys abroad was more immense and better than that of the others, former defence secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa said today.
He expressed these views at the launch of the novel titled Kadol Eththu authored by Maj. Gen. (Rtd.) Kamal Gunaratne in Colombo.
Mr. Rajapaksa said Some asked why retired military officers were appointed as diplomats. One reason was that these appointments recognized the service which they have done to the country. The other reason is that their service done as envoys to the country is more immense than the service done by the others,
He said these officers possessed a great deal of experience about the country and the people by serving in the armed forces. He said a person who serves in the military, especially during a war, has an in-depth understanding about the humans and an instinct to care for them.
Meanwhile, he said Sri Lanka lacks war literature unlike those based on Vietnam and even Iraqi wars. Once, an Indian General asked me why Sri Lanka doesnt have war literature even after we successfully defeated a terrorist group. Therefore, I encourage the military leaders of the three armed forces to pen literature like Kamal Gunaratne, he said.
The book Kadol Eththu is the second book authored by Gunaratne following his first book Road to Nandikkadal which became a hit.
Addressing the book launch, Maj. Gen. (Rtd.) Gunaratne said the novel was based on a disabled war heros life. This is an attempt to make people aware about the disabled war heroes and to admire them but not to sympathize, he said.
He said it was the soldiers who steered the war towards the victory. If it was not for them, we, the officers couldnt have won the war, he said.
The book was presented to Maha Sangha, former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, the wives of Lt. Gen. Denzil Kobbekaduwa and Maj. Gen.Vijaya Wimalaratne.
Former commanders of the three armed forces, MPs including Chamal Rajapaksa, Professors G. L. Peiris, Hiran Amarasekara and a number of old Anandians were presented at this occasion. (By Lahiru Pothmulla)

United National Party (UNP) Deputy Leader Sajith Premadasa said today he would undertake the task of strengthening the party and bring 100,000 people to Galle Face Green for a rally if Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe approved of such a move.
He said this at a ceremony held at the UNP headquarters, Sirikotha to mark the 72nd anniversary of the party. He called for unity among party members if the party was to win the 2020 presidential and general elections to build the nation.
What I predicted about the protest organised by the joint opposition on Wednesday has come true. I said the JO protest would be a feast with biriyani and alcohol, he said.
Meanwhile, UNP Assistant Leader Ravi Karunanayake said the party should organise a mass rally and bring large crowds to Colombo.
It is high time that the party recognised the value of backbenchers. We should build up the party before building the nation, he said.(Yohan Perera)

While stating that the Janabalaya Kolambata was the most successful protest campaign ever in the political history of Sri Lanka, the Joint Opposition challenged the Government to go for a General Election if they claimed that the protest was unsuccessful.
Addressing a news briefing, JO member Namal Rajapaksa said they were able to accomplish the task more than they intended amidst Governments moves to sabotage the protest and prevent it from taking place.
The Government still says that the protest was a failure. We cant fathom as to why they say so after having witnessed the mounting displeasure from thousands of people gathered in the protest, Namal said.  
We challenge the ruling parties to go for an election so that they can see what would be their destiny, he added. (Sheain Fernandopulle)

Importance of hearing voices of dissent
	
The Governments planned Tsunami Warning Rehearsal scheduled in the morning yesterday (September 5) was perhaps a little gimmick to take the attention away from the Janabalaya Colombata protest campaign which was expected to enter Colombo any moment, at the time of writing. 
One thing that this Government does, which the previous regime didnt, is fear the opposition. This fear is largely due to a few factors; chief among which is the citizens not willing to accept the Governments claim that there is development in the country. 
Two other important factors are that defeated former President Mahinda Rajapaksa is now fast gaining aceptancy as a future leader of the country and the increasing cost of living that is choking those who spend their hard-earned monies on purchasing essentials. 
This fear is perhaps what made the Government do all what was possible in sabotaging the opposition sponsored protest rally, a few days before it was set to take to the streets. The Government possibly influenced the decision taken by the Colombo Municipal Council to turn down requests by the opposition to hire Hyde Park and three other grounds owned by the municipality for this protest. Like parliamentarian Vasudeva Nanayakkara stating that he can read the mind of President Sirisena, the joint opposition too has read the mind of the Government and perhaps likes what it sees. The joint opposition now sees a trembling Government, which seems to be viewing its fears through a magnifying glass. The latter shows an object in an increased dimension with the vision it offers being somewhat different from how it looks in reality. 
The Sri Lanka Police through these requests show clearly that they dont wish to thwart a peaceful attempt by the countrys citizens to show their displeasure over the unsatisfactory rule by the Government
Fear cant be measured, but one can obtain an indication of how the law makers of this nation feel by knowing that a 5000 strong police force was to be stationed to control this protest march. There was a Cabinet decision taken to make the police use necessary force in the event public order is disturbed by those involved in the protest rally. 
Those who value democracy in this country have always stressed that the police should be an independent authority, sans the interference of politicians and other forces. It was reported that the courts had rejected requests by officials of three police stations which sought retraining orders in the event there were needs to restrict protesters from marching towards certain areas. Instead the courts ordered the police to take action according to the powers vested in them and the Criminal Procedure Code when dealing with those who breach the law. 
Right to protest
Being able to voice a grievance in the form of a protest is a democratic right and the police must ensure that they do not deny the people this right. One classic example of the law enforcement authorities ensuring this right of the people was recorded in Thailand in 2013. The police were seen taking down barricades and allowing anti-government protesters to enter the compounds of Government buildings. In an ideal democracy the police wouldnt get involved if a frustrated citizenry wishes to get rid of a corrupt regime. The Sri Lanka Police through these requests show clearly that they dont wish to thwart a peaceful attempt by the countrys citizens to show their displeasure over the unsatisfactory rule by the Government. 
This regime has a corrupt tag pinned on it mainly due to the Central Bank Bond issue where the chief accused, Arjuna Mahendran, is yet to be arrested. The Government never really recovered from this blow and saw its wings being clipped further on two occasions; when it had to remove its Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake and the morale denting defeat it suffered at the Local Government polls. 
The Government, if smart, should by now know that the masses of this country are best described by the word impatient. This is what happened when the UNP backed United National Front came to power in 2001 following General Elections. Many opined that that the Government was defeated because it didnt have a micro plan in place while time was taken till the regimes macro plan produced dividends. The same seems to be true this time around too. 
The Government boosts of making headway economically after increasing taxes (VAT). Wickremesinghes theory is that this move has enabled the Government to ease the countrys debt commitment. This regime also boasts of three more highways in the country being built with the help of other nations and are nearing completion. But these development drives by the Government are yet to give the people a significant return which they too can enjoy. The Government can also boast of receiving the chairmanship of BMSTEC which enables Sri Lanka to host the next session of this cooperation, between several Asian countries. But all whats glorified by this government is work-in-progress or promising plans restricted to a paper. 
On this context the Government must take seriously this Janabalaya Colombata campaign where its protesters are voicing their grievances against the sale of Government assets to foreigners, the tax burden on citizens, the increase in cost of living and political victimisation. 
Need of a strong opposition
Any Government needs a strong opposition to make them work harder and limit the errors they make. This is one reason why protest campaigns must be allowed to take place. Protest campaigns against a regime are successful when the grieved party exercises patience. This nation has experienced enough violence and doesnt need even a single episode of violence in the near future. Let the Janabalaya Colombata campaign go peacefully and build a platform from where the voices of the opposition can be heard much clearly in the future.

Indian teacher buys bus to help rural children stay in school
	
Rajaram makes 4 separate trips to collect the children every morning
One of the biggest issues facing children in developing countries is access to education, sometimes it can be financial but location of the villages to the school is another obstacle to be faced. Many children have to walk many kilometers to and from school and because of this, drop-outs are common. Enter Rajaram, a physical education, maths and science teacher from Baarali Government Higher Primary School in the Udapi district of Karnataka in India.
Rajaram noticed last year that many of the local children had stopped attending his classes. There are no roads from the houses of the children to the school. There is a mud path through the forest and most of the girl students began dropping out as their families were scared of allowing their children to walk for a total of 6 km to and from school, Rajaram says. The children were dropping out quickly and with the head count in our school falling drastically, we were at the threat of shutting down too. One evening, I had finished counting how many children had dropped out and I was upset. Every week at least five to six students were not turning up.
It was then Rajaram decided to take action. He made contact with 2 former school pupils who invested money to buy a mini bus. They had another hurdle though, paying a bus driver. With the school unable to allocate any funds and a teachers salary being quite low, the trio found they didnt have the required 7000-8000 rupees to hire a driver. Rajaram again sprang into action and learned how to drive a bus before acquiring his license so he could personally pick and drop off the students each day. Every morning he wakes up early to make four separate trips to collect the children and make sure they are all in school before 9.30 a.m. On top of giving his time to drive the bus so that his students reach the school safely, he also pays for the bus insurance and diesel out of his own pocket. Because of his exceptional efforts, the amount of students at the school has increased from 50 to 90. He has even thought of a backup plan in case hes away  former students have offered their assistance to drive the bus on the days Rajaram is unable to.
So whats next for Rajaram I am thinking of constructing a fence around the school and also a track so children can practice sports. The problem is I dont have enough money. I have reached out to the alumni of the school and asked if they will help. So far, there is a money shortage but I am sure we will surpass that hurdle as well.
Good luck Rajaram and we admire your commitment to helping the students of your school. Making sure that children are educated, especially girls, is an important task that, as a community, we must focus on.

Jana Balaya Kolambata a failure: Ruwan
	
The Jana Balaya Kolambata protest, which was an attempt made by the joint opposition to certifying its next political leader, was a total failure State Minister of Defence Ruwan Wijewardene said yesterday.
Addressing a news briefing held at the Government Information Department last evening, the State Minister said the protest only resulted in inconveniencing the people who were in Colombo.
Because of the protest parents could not send their children to school, people could not get to work. As you know Wednesday is the public day in many ministries and people could not get to meet their ministers because of the protest. It was not the government but the people in the City of Colombo that was affected by this, he said.
He said due to internal issues taking place within the JO, the party was forced to bring people to Colombo.
The protest had no impact on the government. Many people are spending the whole night on the roads in Colombo with the hope of forming a new government tomorrow, he said. (Chaturanga Samarawickrama)

Janabalaya dilutes people's genuine protest against govt.: JVP
	
While claiming that political parties had a right to organise street protests, the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) said today that the Janabalaya protest march organized by the joint opposition had undermined the peoples genuine protest against the government.
JVP MP Vijitha Herath told a news conference that the JO protest was more of a drama than a protest where drunken people had fun on the streets.
Wednesday's protest was a comedy with the people partying on the street after consuming liquor. What happens in such cases is the diluting of the protest against the government. That is why it became a failure with even the organizers admitting it is a failure, he said.
The MP said the government had plunged the country into a grave economic crisis with the rupee depreciating against the dollar each day while the trade deficit was on the increase.
The rupee is depreciating at the rate of 5% for the last three months. The country has had to pay a loan of US$ 4 billion this year. The cost of living is rising. People need to protest against the government but it should be staged in a meaningful way, he said.
The MP said the JVP not only rejected the government's anti-people activities and would act to defeat such activities.
We will not allow another set of thieves to form a government by expelling the current set of thieves, he said. (Ajith Siriwardana)

Japan begins clean-up after typhoon kills 11
	

TOKYO REUTERS, Sept 5 2018- Japan began on Wednesday to clean up after a powerful typhoon killed 11 people, injured hundreds and stranded thousands at a flooded airport, though when the airport in an industrial and tourist hub might reopen was not clear. 
Typhoon Jebi, or swallow in Korean, was briefly a super typhoon and was the most powerful storm to hit Japan in 25 years. It came after months of heavy rain, landslides, floods and record-breaking heat that killed hundreds of people this summer. 
About 3,000 tourists were stuck overnight at Kansai Airport in western Japan, an important hub for companies exporting semiconductors built on reclaimed land on a bay near Osaka and connected to the mainland by a bridge that was damaged when a tanker slammed into it during the storm. 
But by afternoon many people had been rescued by bus or ferried by ship from the airport, where puddles still stood on the main runway after it was inundated on Tuesday. 
Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said on Wednesday afternoon about 470 people were injured. It was uncertain when the airport would reopen and some roads and train lines in the affected areas were still closed, he said.

## Title: MISCONCEPTIONS ABOUT  PROPOSED IMPLEMENTATION OF DEATH PENALTY

MISCONCEPTIONS ABOUT  PROPOSED IMPLEMENTATION OF DEATH PENALTY
	
In recent times there have been a number of articles about the death penalty. The majority of writers have expressed their total opposition to this form of punishment.
However all of these people have completely missed their focus.
What the President stated was that he wanted to implement the death penalty for those presently serving jail sentences for drug trafficking and WHO ARE CARRYING ON THIS TRADE FROM THEIR PRISON CELLS.
Many of the articles which have appeared in your paper refer to persons executed for murder, and who, in very rare cases, have later been found to be innocent. This miscarriage of justice is indeed sad and arguments for the abolition of the death penalty is very reasonable.
But what the President referred to was drug traffickers now in prison and STILL CARRYING ON THEIR despicable TRADE. Here there is no danger of the wrong person being executed.
Today drug trafficking is rampant in this country and youth, even school children are being lured into this habit. Lives are ruined and some have died
Today drug trafficking is rampant in this country and youth, even school children are being lured into this habit. Lives are ruined and some have died. Take the case of the two British rugby players and the more recent case in Wadduwa. Parents have been threatened and even blackmailed by their own children to obtain money for drugs. Wives have been harassed, beaten and abused by their drug addicted husbands who demand money.
Letters have also questioned the laxity of the supervision of jail guards and accused them of aiding and abetting the drug traffickers. But the fact is that these are not just ordinary drug traffickers - they are drug lords with their own evil underworld empire. What they do is to threaten the lives of the prison guards and their families, if they do not obey them. Naturally the prison guards through fear do, as the drug lords command them to do so. For these drug lords, drug trafficking and murder go hand in hand. They will not be deterred by any jail term to carry on their trade. They do not feel any remorse for the evil they do.
Now let those who talk about the sanctity of human life and demand the non-implementation of the death penalty for drug trafficking also consider the sanctity of the lives of the victims who have become addicted to drugs because of their easy availability. Are not the lives of those who are addicted to drugs and whose lives have been consequently ruined also precious. Thousands of addicts are in this sad plight because of a few pernicious, evil-minded persons.
How can the drug trafficking menace be minimized
The fact is that a jail term is not an effective deterrent. Drug traffickers must be punished. If the death penalty is too abhorrent, then give these drug traffickers lashes! Mr. President, do something. Go ahead and implement the death penalty as you promised or give them lashes. For the sake of future generations do something to eradicate this country from the drug menace.

15 mn high-dose Tramadol tablets seized
	
A stock of more than 15 million high-dose Tramadol pills was nabbed yesterday at the Sri Lanka harbour by the Police Narcotic Bureau (PNB) Officers, Police Media Spokesman SP Ruwan Gunasekera said.
He said the contraband was found in a container following a tip-off to the Police Narcotic Bureau (PNB) officers.
The raid was conducted with the support of the customs officers, he said.
Each pill contains 225 milligrams dosage of Tramadol which is higher than the dosage recommended by physicians, SP Gunasekera said.
He said during the raid, PNB officers found 150,50170 pills packed in 585 boxes.
The container was raided on transhipment to Libya from its manufactured country India, via the Colombo Harbour.
The PNB is conducting further investigations, but no suspects had been arrested yet, he said.
Meanwhile, a Customs official said the container had been taken under PNB custody during the transhipment and it was suspicious to say that the Tramadol pills must have been imported to the country as an alternative to heroin. (Chaturanga Samarawickrama)

## Title: Notes for a Manifesto:  Education Reforms

Notes for a Manifesto:  Education Reforms
	
If anyone doubts that the entire educational system should be reformed, a quick listen to statements made by Higher Education Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe (WR) would force a re-think. On the one hand he extols the virtues of private education and insists that this way lies the future, then he submits a Cabinet Paper to take over the Sri Lanka Institute of Information Technology (SLIIT). 
The reasons offered are hilarious. WR tells us that SLIIT was initially managed by a private company though owned by the Government (he probably meant State) with money being released from the Mahapola Trust Fund (MTF) to construct the first building. Three years ago, WR claims, SLIIT had paid some 400 million rupees to the MTF and purchased a new lease for the property. 
WR is concerned that there are no government officials on the SLIIT board now. He believes that less than half a million rupees is a gross under-valuation considering the worth of SLIIT assets, which by the way were not paid for by the Government. Hes most concerned about the fate of SLIIT students since there is no rightful owner to this institution. 
Thats WRs SLIIT story. Another version would give a more comprehensive and detailed picture. It would speak of SLIIT being established in 1999 by a group of eminent academics and professionals as a Company Limited by Guarantee to address the demand for IT professionals. It would mention how SLIIT expanded, establishing centres in Matara, Kandy, Jaffna and Kurunegala, while creating opportunities for the study of other fields. It is a success story, by and large. If an owner-less institution can offer graduate and postgraduate degrees in multiple disciplines, secure accreditation from renowned international certifying authorities in a country where the owned universities have little to brag about, it is clear that ownership is not an issue. Perhaps WR should study how not-for-profit entities operate, assess the track record of SLIIT, compare it with institutions such as the one he wishes to turn SLIIT into and check his tongue before making statements if only to avoid contradiction andobtain coherence. 
The state spends billions on education and yet the end product clearly indicates that the return on investment is low
Its more than an issue of private versus public (or a mixture). It is about institutional and programmatic coherence and it is also about quality. Lets consider thecurrent situation. The state spends billions on education and yet the end product clearly indicates that the return on investment is low. It appears that the relevant authorities have not updated themselves about the objectives of education, new methodologies and the need for synergy. 
At present the public education system lags behind private systems by as much as two years. It is an exam-oriented system and one which effectively pushes a 15 or 16-year-old into a particular stream. A student that young cannot know what he/she is good at or what would sustain his/her interests. Moreover it makes it impossible for him/her to shift streams in the event it was discovered that he/she chose poorly. Blinders are imposed early and a student cannot explore other areas of study. For example, the course-rigidity does not allow a mathematics student to learn biology, commerceor literature. 
3This needs to be corrected. It cannot be impossible to come up with a system which gives students more flexibility in the combination of subjects, especially at the tertiary level. For example, it should be possible and indeed compulsory for a student focusing on the social sciences to obtain more than rudimentary instruction in commerce, mathematics and biology where the student can select from a basket of subject options. The entire examination-schedule can be restructured to allow for two or more exams that count towards the final overall result where a student, if he/she feels that he/she has made a mistake could, after the initial set of exams, shift disciplinary focus. 
While there are assignments, group projects and such, they do not count towards the final grade that a student achieves. Therefore, naturally, what is fostered is a culture of exam-mania. Its a do or die matter and those who die are buried, as per custom. 
Ideally, there should be a system which strikes a balance between school-based assessment and evaluation through competitive exams. Centres could be set up to facilitate schools and teachers to conduct such assessment and also oversee the integration of new and innovative learning/teaching mechanisms. 
In any event, there has to be a strong civil-education component in the school curriculum especially to ensure that students who benefit from subsidies are made aware of how much is spent on them, who coughs up the money and what this entails in terms of giving back at some point. 
Such an initiative would have to be complemented by a licensing system for all those who aspire to be teachers. Having a degree does not mean one is automatically suited to teach. It is unfair to subject children to the supervision by those who are engaged in on-the-job training. Thats like getting a medical student to prescribe medicine. 
The overall idea is to ensure that when a student exits school, he/she has a more rounded education, is empowered with the ability to work with others, a healthy curiosity, good communication skills in at least two languages (including English) and an innovative frame of mind among other things. 
There are other issues. International schools operate largely without any supervision. In this case it is not about curriculum, but policies and practices, some of which are highly questionable. What is proposed is of course not policing, but a system of licensing that requires adherence to standards across all areas of operation. 
There are lots of institutes, both private and public, devoted to higher studies. There are also institutes that focus on technical education. Theres overlap and theres sidelining. Such things can be corrected by reviewing and if necessary restructuring the institutional arrangement to obtain a greater degree of coherence and enhance synergy. 
Education is obviously a key element of national development. Therefore, higher education (subsequent to the empowerment through a reformed school education structure) has to be tied to overall skills requirements. This necessitates a comprehensive occupational classification based on current realities and those that envisaged development could produce. In other words we need to know what kind of human resources we need, envisage the needs down the line and ensure that these needs do not compromise the fundamentals of education -- a solid enough foundation in the sciences, mathematics, social sciences and humanities regardless of whether or not direct arrows can be drawn from courses to jobs. 
Another version would give a more comprehensive and detailed picture. It would speak of SLIIT being established in 1999 by a group of eminent academics and professionals as a Company Limited by Guarantee to address the demand for IT professionals
Unfortunately, we are stuck in a mindset thats best exemplified by the confusion betrayed by the Higher Education Minister. The preference has been for uttering truisms, misunderstand and misarticulating the problem, addressing pieces of it and in an ad hoc manner and leaving things by and large unchanged. 
We can and must do better. Please take note Nagananda Kodituwakku, Rohan Pallewatte, Gotabaya Rajapaksa, Patali Champika Ranawaka, Ranil Wickremesinghe, Maithripala Sirisena and any other individual entertaining hopes of becoming the next President of Sri Lanka.

Revolutionary charging: Rapid Charge with VOOC
OPPO found that the most common problem of Sri Lankanusers is battery life. These consumers often land in some awkward situations where they are running out of battery. Keeping these in mind, OPPO F9 comes with VOOC Flash Charge. This technology, independently developed by OPPO, applies low voltage charging technology and has a charging speed up to four times faster than general charging at 5V/1A. And if youre in a hurry, a quick 5-minute charge is enough to maintain 2 hours of talk time.
In addition to increasing the charging speed by four times, VOOC also boasts an intelligent five-layer protection system from the adaptor to the port and interior of the phone. VOOC has replaced the voltage reducing circuit with a MCU, making VOOC a cool fast charging tech. You can also use your phone and maintain high speed fast charging, which high voltage fast charge will not be able to support.
Since OPPO launched VOOC in 2014, VOOC has applied over 500 patents and is used by over 90 million consumers, making VOOC the most mature commercial fast charging technique. In terms of battery life, F9 is equipped with a 3500mAh battery and an optimized AI battery management. Its fair to say F9 guarantees a great battery life.
Cutting-Edge Design: Waterdrop Screen with Gradient colors
As an increasingly popular smartphone brand among young people, OPPO taps into their tastes in fashion and style to design products with far-reaching appeal. With gradient colors, the youth can showcase their personality and attitude.
OPPO has three gradient color combinations - Sunrise Red, Twilight Blue and Starry Purple. The Gradient Spraying Technology and Frame Gradient tech used by OPPO realizes a perfect combination of gradient design on the back and the user a more unified viewing experience. In the sunlight, the F9 shines like a crystal gem and flowing water. The color design aesthetics of the OPPO F9 reflects both OPPO's design ideology and insights into what aesthetics appeals to young consumers around the globe.
Besides the gradient color design, the F9 screen is also beautiful and appealing. OPPO has always believed a smartphone is not just a tool for communication but also a piece of art. The screen occupies almost all of F9 except for a small droplet shaped notch called the Waterdrop Screen, inspired by a water drop.
The F9 comes with an impressive 6.3-inch bezel-less screen that features a resolution of 1080*2340 and an aspect ratio of 19.5:9, a super-high screen-to-body ratio of 90.8%.
Unparalleled photography: From Selfie Expert to Portrait Artist
OPPOs legacy of strong photography is even further enhanced with OPPO F9. While OPPO initially established its expertise as the Selfie Expert", the brand has now begun to focus on capturing all round beauty.
For the first time, OPPO F series is equipped with dual rear cameras (16MP + 2MP). There are a few common pain points that a user faces with portrait mode. Firstly, you often get blurry and fake Bokeh effect. Secondly, the lighting condition is complicated, causing images to be either over-exposed or particularly dark. The main camera for F9 at the rear is a 16MP plus f/1.8 aperture lens. This, plus the secondary camera, will calculate the depth-of-field to achieve better Bokeh effect for rear photography.
After the hardware completed Bokeh effect, the F9 portrait mode can use the depth information to add light and apply AI beautification to get an exclusive portrait lighting style.
Users can achieve different effects using Film Light, Natural Light and Rim Light for a great portrait photography experience. In regard to shooting with the rear camera, F9 is equipped with dual cameras to catch every moment. 16 independent and 800 combined scenes can be recognized by AI Scene Recognition.
OPPO F9 25MP front-facing camera also does not disappoint. OPPO F9 can accurately collect 296 feature points for each subject, referencing them against its massive database of facial images, analyzing features before making enhancements, customized for each subject. The AI Beauty Technology 2.1 can provide users with up to 8 million different personalized beautification effects  now selfies are more attractive while keeping the natural look of each human subject intact.
Additionally, F9 supports multiple interesting camera features such as AR Stickers, Super Vivid mode and slow motion video.
Rewarding experience: ColorOS 5.2 AI Intuitive System
Based on Android 8.1, OPPO brings the ColorOS 5.2 Operating System to create a smarter interactive experience for users. Intelligence is everywhere in ColorOS 5.2. The F9 isequipped with the Google Lens that identifies objects and shows relevant search results and information.
When it comes to hardware, the 4GB/6GB + 64GB memory combination improves the speed of operation. F9 also supports 256GB memory expansion. To satisfy users with multiple SIM cards, F9 applies a design that contains 3 card slots, two for SIM cards and one for the storage card.
At the launch, OPPO also announced the OPPO F9 Pro, another variant of the F series family which will be hitting the Sri Lankan market soon.

## Title: Physical activities can reduce Percentage of Mortality
## Section: News Features
## Date: 6 September 2018 12:00 am
Physical activities can reduce Percentage of Mortality
	
According to the WHO (2014), Non-communicable Disease country profiles, most percentage of mortality by cause is in Sri Lanka, in 2014 was cardiovascular disease (40%). Lack of exercise or any physical activity is responsible for 30% mortality in men and 60% of death rate in women. It is the most important cause of preventable deaths all over the world. Some of the daily life activities which lead to a sedentary lifestyle are reading, sitting, watching television, use of the computer and playing video games. Diseases whose risk factor increases due to a lack of exercise are formation of kidney stones, liver disorders, high blood pressure, diabetes, colon cancer, depression, cardiovascular disease, anxiety, obesity, osteoporosis and clotting of blood.
Regular exercise is one of the best things you can do for your health. It has many benefits, including improving your overall health and fitness, and reducing your risk for many chronic diseases. There are many different types of exercise; it is important that you pick the right types for you. Most people benefit from a combination of them: Did you know When you are not physically active, you are more likely to:
Get heart disease
	Get type 2 diabetes
	Have high blood pressure
	Have high blood cholesterol
	Have a stroke
What is physical activity 
Did you know Physical activity is any form of exercise or movement of the body that uses energy. Some of your daily life activities -- doing active chores around the house, yard work, walking the dog -- are examples. To get the health benefits of physical activity, include activities that make you breathe harder and make your heart and blood vessels healthier. These aerobic activities include things like brisk walking, running, dancing, swimming, and playing basketball. The employee wellness programme at my work just started with a new lunchtime walking programme. Some of us walk at a good clip, while others move at a slower pace. I get to be outdoors, and I feel more alert on the days I walk.
Less active and less fit people have a greater risk of developing high blood pressure
Getting Started to think about adding physical activity to your life, but not sure how to start Sometimes taking the first step is the hardest part. If you have not been active for some time, start at a comfortable level and add a little more activity as you go along. Some people find that getting active with a friend makes it easier to get started. Is something holding you back Think about reasons why you have not been physically active. Then try to come up with some ways to get past what is keeping you from getting active. Have you said to yourself . . .  I havent been active for a very long time.
Solution: Choose something you like to do. Many people find walking helps them get started. Before you know it, you will be doing more each day. I dont have the time. Solution: Start with 10-minute chunks of time a couple of days a week. Walk during a break. Dance in the living room to your favorite music. It all adds up.
Effects of lack of physical exercise
Lack of physical activity for a long time is found to cause wide ranging metabolic and structural changes in the body. Some of these bodily changes are declining in the physical endurance, rise in the heart beat, reduction in the blood volume and partial or complete wastage of bones and muscles.
Benefits of physical fitness: Staying, active means is keeping your body functioning at a high level. Regular exercise will maintain the performance of your lungs and heart to most efficiently burn off excess calories and keep your weight under control. Exercise will also improve muscle strength, increase joint flexibility and improve endurance.
Another main benefit of physical activity is that it decreases the risk of heart disease, the leading cause of death in America. Additionally, it can decrease your risk of stroke, colon cancer, diabetes and high blood pressure. Regular exercise has been long associated with a fewer visits to the doctor, hospitalization and medication.
Exercising does not have to be something boring and dreaded. It can be something that you enjoy that helps to increase the overall happiness in your life, as well as relieve symptoms of stress, depression and anxiety. Try to find some activities that give you pleasure or even a buddy to do them with so that exercise is a fun and enjoyable activity (and one that you continue on a regular basis because it adds something good to your life).
What health risks are linked to physical inactivity
Lack of physical activity has clearly been shown to be a risk factor for cardiovascular disease and other conditions:
Less active and less fit people have a greater risk of developing high blood pressure.
	Physical activity can reduce your risk for type 2 diabetes.
	Studies show that physically active people are less likely to develop coronary heart disease than those who are inactive. This is even after researchers accounted for smoking, alcohol use, and diet.
	Lack of physical activity can add to feelings of anxiety and depression. 
	Physical inactivity may increase the risk of certain cancers. 
	Physically active overweight or obese people significantly reduced their risk for disease with regular physical activity.
	Older adults who are physically active can reduce their risk for falls and improve their ability to do daily activities.
What a physical activity can do for you
It is not what you are doing, as much as it is whether or not you are doing something. Any type of moderate activity like walking, swimming, biking or organized sports can contribute to your physical fitness. Explore your fitness options at your local gym, community center or community college for courses and organized activities that may suit your lifestyle and interests.
To get the most benefit, you should begin by warming up for 5 - 10 minutes to increase your blood flow and prepare your body for activity. Follow the warm up with several minutes of stretches to increase your flexibility and lower your risk for injury. Complete your selected exercise or activity for 20 - 30 minutes and conclude the workout with 5 - 10 minutes of cool down and stretching.
You may have heard the good things you can gain from regular physical activity. Check off which of these benefits you hope to get from active living: Be healthier, increase your chances of living longer and feel better about yourself. Have less chance of becoming depressed sleep better at night help you look good in shape get around better. Have stronger muscles and bones. Help you stay at or get to a healthy weight. Be with friends or meet new people. Enjoy yourself and have fun strengthening activities to make your muscles stronger, like sit-ups and lifting weights. 
Choose activities that work all the different parts of the bodyyour legs, hips, back, chest, stomach, shoulders, and arms. Exercises for each muscle group should be repeated 8 - 12 times per session. Try some of these activities a couple of days a week:
Heavy gardening (digging, shoveling)
	lifting weights
	Push-ups on the floor or against the wall
	Sit-ups
	Working with resistance bands (long, wide rubber strips that stretch)
Tip: Some people like resistance bands because they find them easy to use and put away when they are done. Others prefer weights; you can use common grocery items, such as bags of rice. 
Advice to follow: You should do at least 2 hours and 30 minutes each week of aerobic physical activity at a moderate level. OR you should do at least one hour and 15 minutes each week of aerobic physical activity at a vigorous level. Do it your way. You can replace some or all of your moderate activity with vigorous activity. With vigorous activities, you get similar health benefits in half the time it takes you with moderate ones.
Muscle strengthening activities: Remember to do on two or more days a week. Adding more time strives to double your weekly activity time. Work to be active or find out what kind and how much physical activity you need and how do I do it. Its your choice. Pick an activity thats easy to fit into your life. Do at least 10 minutes of physical activity at a time. Choose aerobic activities that work for you. These make your heart beat faster and can make your heart, lungs, and blood vessels stronger and fit. Also, do strengthening activities which make your muscles do more work than usual
Why should I be physically active
Physical activity can make you feel stronger and more alive. It is a fun way to be with your family or friends. It also helps you improve your health. 
Be active in your Way
A guide for adults: How many times a week should I be physically active It is up to you, but it is better to spread your activity throughout the week and to be active at least three days a week. How do I build up more physical activity Do a little more each time. Once you feel comfortable, do it more often. Then you can trade activities at a moderate level for vigorous ones that take more effort. You can do moderate and vigorous activities in the same week, more hours each week for even more health. Regular exercise can help you control your weight, reduce your risk of heart disease, and strengthen your bones and muscles. But if its been awhile since youve exercised and you have health issues or concerns, its a good idea to talk to your doctor before starting a new exercise routine.
Although moderate physical activity such as brisk walking is safe for most people, health experts suggest that you talk to your physician as well as physical therapist before you start an exercise programme if any of the following apply:
You have heart disease.
	You have asthma or lung disease.
	You have type 1 or type 2 diabetes.
	You have kidney disease.
	You have arthritis.
If youre being treated for cancer, or you have recently completed cancer treatment, you should also check with your physician that if you have symptoms suggestive of heart, lung or other serious disease such as:
Pain or discomfort in your chest, neck, jaw or arms during physical activity
	Dizziness, light-headedness, or fainting with exercise or exertion
	Shortness of breath with mild exertion, at rest, or when lying down or going to bed
	Ankle swelling, especially at night
	A rapid or pronounced heartbeat
	A heart murmur that your doctor has previously diagnosed
	Lower leg pain when you walk, which goes away with rest
Finally, the Chartered society of Physiotherapy in Sri Lanka recommends that you see your physiotherapist before engaging in vigorous exercise, if two or more of the following apply:
Youre older than 35 years.
	You have a family history of heart disease before age 60.
	You smoke or you quit smoking in the past six months.
	You dont normally exercise for at least 30 minutes, most days of the week.
	Youre significantly overweight.
	You have high blood pressure or high cholesterol.
You have type 1 or type 2 diabetes, or you have impaired glucose tolerance. If youre unsure of your health status, have multiple health problems or are pregnant, speak with your doctor before starting a new exercise programme. Working with your doctor ahead of time can help you plan the exercise program thats right for you. And thats a good first step on your path to physical fitness.
Physical activity can make you feel stronger
An important piece of advice from the experts to those who want to commence exercise is that the beginning should be made in small measures. The body and the mind should be given ample time to get used to a new and progressive mode of functioning. Going for a walk of 10 minutes; three times a day; can be a good start. As the body gains stamina, this mild regime of exercise can be slowly extended to a moderate level and finally if possible to a rigorous form in a years time.
Just like how workouts provide a number of positive benefits to your body, lack of exercise also creates many negative effects. When you dont exercise regularly, it can affect your mood, muscles, bones, heart, joints, levels of blood sugar and lungs. Lack of workouts will make your bones very weak, accumulates excess body weight, causes malfunction of organs or failure and heart issues. It would also create several chronic medical conditions, such as hypertension and diabetes.

Revisiting Adareyi Mang
	
In hindsight, I was wrong to review Prageeth Ratnayakes Adareyi Mang the way I did. Because the film had a story that Ive seen countless times before and because I knew how that story would end, I focused instead on the techniques the director had employed to help us see beyond it, and though this was a good criterion with which the merits of the film could be discussed, it was hardly the only or even the main one. My mistake was to let this particular criterion cloud my judgment, because form and technique, no matter how pivotal they may be to a work of art, are hardly the crux of an art. If that were so, Hitchcock would be occupying a higher pedestal than Satyajit Ray and Yasujiro Ozu. As it turns out, however, he is not. This is thus an attempt at trying to glean what it was in Prageeths movie that was so different and so unique, despite its facilely overworked, overused plot.
I began my review by comparing the opening sequence to a sequence from Brian De Palmas Body Double. Part of the charm of Adareyi Mang is that, like De Palmas film; it does not let us off its hook and heres something to be upset about, something to be ruffled by. But De Palmas movies are preoccupied with style (over substance), and what was true for his work is true also of Prageeths work; as I noted, its first half is full of sequences that look as though they were conceived mechanically, as though they were afraid of loosening up, as though slackening up was, in his [Prageeths] opinion, antithetical to the meticulousness of his editing. I am far from suggesting that these two directors can be compared, but I do admit that there is a problem common to both: that for the first hour at least, the technique dictates the material.
Prageeth is at his strongest in Adareyi Mang where the material dominates the technique. There are many sequences which never seem to end:
Prageeth is at his strongest in Adareyi Mang where the material dominates the technique. There are many sequences which never seem to end: when Pawan runs after Malmi, having chased her away from the Montessori; when Pawan waits at the bus stand for her to arrive with her friend; when Pawan tries again and again to win her love in a bus; when Pawan finally does win her love and breaks up in a frenzy of song and dance along Galle Road. These are hackneyed, yes, but compared with those sequences where the emotions seem to be contrived, they breathe in an inexorably fresh way. I pointed this out in my review as well when I argued that the second half, and the song and dance sequences therein, were more sincerely felt than (those of) the first half. And yet, I failed to justify my contention with a valid point of comparison. What could such a point of comparison be
Overworked plot and finale
Simply, this: that despite an overworked plot that ends in an overworked finale (with a rather overworked twist: Malmi as a person is more beautiful for Pawan than her long, lustrous hair), Adareyi Mang occupies a territory very different to that of most other love stories weve seen on the silver screen here, from Anjalike to Rosa Kale to Asayi Mang Piyabanna. To understand why, we need to look at what drives Prageeth in his film, and where his influences lie.
The Sinhala cinema was always associated with its technically more proficient counterpart in Mumbai and Madras. I remember coming across a review of Kadawunu Poronduwa which stated that Rukmani Devi and the Jayamanne brothers had added Sinhala to the 12 languages of the South Indian cinema. Given that popular Indian films were melodramatic romances which ended with the hero being reconciled to his lover, it made sense for producers here to try and reap dividends from that genre. In the end, that is what they did.
Without overtly delving into this process of cultural assimilation (or imitation), it is enough to know that in one point the plot lines in these romances changed over the decades: while earlier the boy was poor and the girl rich, by the eighties and nineties the boy had become rich and the girl poor. This had to do with a shift in the genre brought about, not by the Indian cinema, rather by the American cinema, specifically Love Story, which gave birth to that timeless and hackneyed motif of the rich boy, cast aside by his family, trying to save his poor lover (whom he has now married) from a fatal illness (which was almost always leukaemia). Such a trope had been evident even before, as witness the films of Douglas Sirk, but with Love Story, the protagonist, who had been poor all this while and had to fight for the girl from a respectable household, now became rich.
The Sinhala cinema was always associated with its technically more proficient counterpart in Mumbai and Madras
The Sinhala cinema, for obvious reasons, reflected this shift. Gamini Fonseka, in 1972, had acted as a poor, but talented painter in J. Selvaratnams Sahanaya opposite Malini Fonseka, who was the rich heiress; three years later, in Lenin Moraess Awa Soya Adare, the roles had changed: Fonseka was the rich heir, Malini the well-meaning servants daughter. If I cant think of a single mainstream film after this in which the woman was rich and the man poor, its because by then, the trend had changed, and the tone of melodramatic romances had shifted.
Adareyi Mang is a continuation of this tradition, so to speak, but with a twist: it takes us back to the seventies, the era where this shift originally transpired, and not to the present, where melodrama has been replaced with fantasy. When you think of Asayi Mang Piyabanna and even Rosa Kale, you think of lover crooning by lakes and rivers and mountainsides about how they want to spend their life together (it was when this cycle of song and dance sequences first came to us somewhere in the late nineties that Nanda Malini and Sunil Ariyaratne came up with Yanawanam Ane Mang Aran). It was a fantasy world alright, but very different to the one we had seen in the seventies, when we actually cared about the people we saw in front of us.
Cinematic indigenisation
Part of the reason why we refused to care about the heroes and their lovers thereafter was, I think, the fact that we began to be more assailed than ever before by colourful saree-pota-song sequences in Indian melodramas, and the fact that the administrators throughout the seventies made it a point to indigenise the industry, which did not continue after the economy was opened. After all, no matter how imitative they were of their Indian counterpart, the films of Lenin Moraes and even Robin Tampoe could never escape this process of cinematic indigenisation.
A film like Asayi Mang Piyabanna has more potential at the box office now because audiences today are more in tune with such fantasies. Who doesnt want to see Pooja Umayashankar as a poor and downtrodden (but incongruously, immaculately dressed) peasant girl in love with Roshan Ranawana Its a fantasy land based on and copied from another fantasy land (Sri Lanka from India), and mass audiences, especially teenagers and older women who have nothing much outside their banal lives (at school or at home), love it. Sunil Ariyaratne addressed them only too well:
Pingana aran lunuyi bathuyi kamuko raththaran
Eeta pass Dunhinda langa natamu raththaran
In other words, people want to be titillated by the specifics of this kind of film: the first encounter between the two destined-to-be lovers (always through an accident); the initial warming up of both parents to each other (in Asayi Mang Piyabanna the father of the hero, played by Kingsley Loos, asks the girl and her father to pay him a visit in Colombo); the opposition of the one to the other (the rich parents on the basis of keeping up their status, the poor parents on the basis of principles); the clandestine song-and-dance numbers; the final battle between the rich fathers goons and the girls cohorts (who by this time include the rich son himself); and the final reconciliation of everyone to everyone else. Reworked a hundred times over, these specifics never fail to milk money at the Regal or the Majestic or the Savoy; they have been so carefully preserved that they have become a mantra to be followed, to the dot.
Without overtly delving into this process of cultural assimilation (or imitation), it is enough to know that in one point the plot lines in these romances changed over the decades. while earlier the boy was poor and the girl rich, by the eighties and nineties the boy had become rich and the girl poor
The beauty of Adareyi Mang is that it resists the urge to give into those specifics. To be sure, Pawan and Malmi do meet by accident, and to be sure, the parents of both warm up to and then charge against each other. But then these are motifs which, while recognisable, are done away with as soon as possible; neither Pawan nor Malmi cares for the antics of their parents, and the sequences of malice, though jarring, are quickly resolved. One of the main reasons for this is, I feel, the choice of composer, for Victor Ratnayake, over more than five musical numbers, take us back to the seventies, the era of Matharaachchi and Rajagedara Paraviyo (both of which, incidentally, were directed by Sathischandra Edirisinghe), of Andura Bindinnata and Neela Bingu Kela. 
The tragedy of Prageeths film is this, therefore: that in belonging to the seventies, and in a good way at that, it (metaphorically speaking) alienates those schoolboys who want to chase schoolgirls and those schoolgirls who want to be chased by all those schoolboys. You need to be intelligent, to be more alive to craftsmanship, to tear yourself away from Asayi Mang Piyabanna and savour Adareyi Mang. We are not intelligent, I am afraid to admit.

SL Surgeon wins prestigious award from Edinburghs Royal College of Surgeons
	
Recipient of the prestigious award Dr. Nadeesha Jeevan Nawarathna is seen standing third from left in the picture
Bringing Sri Lanka to the limelight and making her proud, Senior Registrar in Gastrointestinal Surgery attached to the Teaching Hospital, Kandy Dr. Nadeesha Jeevan Nawarathna is yet another brilliant mind that has done a tremendous service to the nation as a seasoned, medical professional. Dr. Nawarathna is the first Sri Lankan surgeon to win a prestigious award from the esteemed, Royal College of Surgeons, Edinburgh following the successful completion of the MRCS Edinburgh exams, which stand for the Membership to the Royal College of Surgeons Edinburgh.
Dr. Nawarathna who was educated during his primary years in a remote village in Puttalam was a promising student hailing from Dutugemunu Vidyalaya, Puttalam. Reminiscing his academic years, Dr. Nawarathna said that he got through the grade 5 scholarship, thereby gaining eligibility to enter the St. Sylvesters College, Kandy. Following the successful completion of the Advanced Level Examination in 2003 with best results in school, he managed to enter the Faculty of Medicine, University of Peradeniya in 2004, in his very first attempt.
This is the first time aSri Lankan surgeon was awarded this medal. A qualified doctor with a MBBS or a MB will be eligible to sit for this exam. This exam is basically conducted to gain entry into the UK Postgraduate Training Programme
He who got through his MBBS with flying colours and a specialization in subjects like Microbiology, passed out from University in 2009 and started internship as a surgical trainee in 2011. Speaking to Daily Mirror, he said that during this time he was attached to the University of Rajarata for a few months while also been engaged in several other researches.Soon as I completed my internship, I sat for the Surgery Exam Part 1 and got through the exam in my first attempt. I was also attached to the Postgraduate Institute of Medicine as a surgical trainee. After three and-a-half years of surgical training also known as the Registrar Period, which includes registrar in surgery, I sat for the MB Surgery Exam Part 2 and became the second in merit order. Meantime, I did a lot of researches as well and recently I got a travel grant from Asia Pacific Digestive Week in 2018. Of the seventy travel grants that were offered, I have received one. Accordingly, Ill be visiting South Korea in November Dr. Nawarathna added.
Explaining about the Royal College of Surgeons in England, he said that basically they are three Colleges in England. The Royal College of Surgeons, England, Royal College of Surgeons, Glasgow and the Royal College of Surgeons, Edinburgh. I sat for MRCS exam in 2017 August and was awarded the Pradeep Dutta Medal by the Royal College of Surgeons Edinburgh. This medal is awarded for the surgeon who has achieved the highest mark in the MRCS Edinburgh and the candidate should also meet the criteria of being from a SAARC country. Explaining about Dr. Pradeep Dutta, he said that Duttas origin is from India and Calcutta to be specific. He was practicing as a surgeon in UK and was a very good teacher. Dr. Dutta has done an enormous service to the Royal College of Surgeons, Edinburgh. He has served a long duration and has done a good service to all prospective candidates who sat for this exam. Currently, Dr. Dutta is living in a remote area in the UK and I am planning to visit him in future Dr. Nawaeathna said.
This is the first time a Sri Lankan surgeon was awarded this medal. A qualified doctor with a MBBS or a MB will be eligible to sit for this exam. This exam is basically conducted to gain entry into the UK Postgraduate Training Programme. I have obtained the membership in two Colleges out of the three; that is the Royal College of Surgeons Glasgow and in the Royal College of Surgeons, Edinburgh. If a doctor needs to obtain his or her post graduate training in UK, it is vital to have at least one membership out of these three Colleges. Im very proud to say that up to now I have not given into any delay in my work and within a minimum age, I have managed to achieve everything Dr. Navarathna concluded.

The Insurance Industry Celebrates 2nd National Insurance Day
	
Mr. Sudeera Senaratne, the Director of Investigations of the Insurance Regulatory Commission of Sri Lanka addressing the gathering
Senaratne, the Director of Investigations of the Insurance Regulatory Commission of Sri Lanka reminded the gathering of how just last year the Government declared the 1st of September as National Insurance Day thanks to the collaboration of the IASL and the IRCSL. Mr. Senaratne theorized this to be due to the value brought to the economy by the Insurance industry. He also advised the gathered Insurance advisors to think long-term rather than short-term. Raising and building awareness is highly significant to the long-term development plan of Sri Lankas Insurance industry.
Mr. Lokuarachchi, President of the IASL, emphasized on the primary duty of members of the Insurance industry, which is to provide protection for all lives and assets. The current increase in life expectancy shows us that people are becoming more health conscious. A number of companies have recognized new opportunities in the current status of customer requirements and have accordingly introduced solutions to meet these needs. Today we have an opportunity to reach out to the general public and raise awareness about our trade. This is our chance to strengthen the vocation of Insurance.
What is now becoming the traditional oath of the industry was sworn at the conclusion of every event and group by group the Insurance advisors in their colorful t-shirts representing their respective companies scattered across the towns to fulfill their mission.

The State of  Tamil Eelam, 1990-2009
	
This article is the second of those preparing the ground for a review of the new data on the last phase of Eelam War IV served up by access to the despatches of the British Defence Attache Lt. Col. Gash (the first being an analysis of Prabhakarans strategy of assassinations). It concentrates on the character of the state of Tamil Eelam throughout its period of existence, viz. from 1990-2009. It by-passes the pre-history when the Tamil New Tigers-become-LTTE was an incipient insurgent force competing with other Tamil militant organisations and with the GoSL and or the IPKF for control of terrain. 
Tamil Eelam in its fuller emergent state form could be said to have originated in early 1990 when the IPKF forces departed and the LTTE insurgents gained control of most of the Jaffna Peninsula. This span of control increased in mid-1990s when the Tiger insurgents out-manoeuvred the Premadasa government and seized control of most of the Eastern Province after attacking and seizing several police stations and then massacring around 600 policemen who had surrendered. This spatial reach was reduced in mid-late 1995 when the SL Army attacked from the Palaly enclave and seized control of the Jaffna Peninsula. But it then expanded again when the Tiger forces over-ran the SL Army base at Mullaitivu in 1996 and then took control of Kilinochchi town and eventually the huge army base at Elephant Pass in 1999-2000.
However, the LTTE and its supporters abroad always had larger territorial ambitions and its maps of the Eelam project were in step with the traditional homelands claim presented by the ITAK (Federal Party) from 1949 onwards  thereby embracing Puttalam and Chilaw in the expansive world-view typical of all fascist states in their embryonic stage. 
There is little doubt, therefore, that the Tiger leadership launched Eelam War IV in mid-2006 with a conviction that they could cap their existing paraphernalia of statehood with formal worldwide confirmation.
Thus, from 1990 one witnesses the LTTE setting up an independent administration in its territories with Velupillai Prabhakaran as its talaivar or Supreme Leader and its military commanders as the dominant authority in all regional centres. There was a civil administration consisting of the previous Tamil civilians who had served the government of Sri Lanka and who retained the titles of yesteryear. Over time the LTTE inserted some of its own personnel alongside some of these posts or displaced these persons with their own appointees. This process involved the creation and or overseeing of the judicial organisation as well. The law courts were LTTE run and instruments of control. 
The LTTEs consolidation of state authority was enhanced by its military successes in the period 1996-2001. It reached out for international status with considerable assistance from Norway and the latters point man Eric Solheim. The military clout secured after they brought the Kumaratunga government to its knees in 1999-2001 enabled the LTTE to sign a ceasefire via A Memoranda of Understanding in April 2002 in formalities associated with all the characteristics of a state. This status was beamed to the whole world on10th April 2002 when media personnel from many countries assembled at Kilinochchi to witness the Talaivar Prabhakaran, his de facto Foreign Minister Anton Balasingham and the Political Commissar, Thamil Chelvam, hold court in solemn splendour. 
Tamil Eelam under the LTTE was an efficient authoritarian state run by a dictator who commanded widespread respect among its citizenry. Its propaganda capacities were as innovative as remarkable. Central to its process of cultivating respect was the homage paid to its fighting dead, the maaveerar, at a ceremony held on the 27th November every year at the 21 thuyilum ilam (resting houses) in LTTE territory  sites that were regarded as temples. 
These events were preceded by several weeks of intense propaganda work and appropriate music blanketing the air waves everywhere and maaveerar-sheds depicting the dead maaveerar from each locality at judicious locations in each locality. Remarkably, as I can attest from my experience in Jaffna Peninsula in late November 2004, such processes and events devoted to the deepening of Tamilness and obeisance to the talaivar and his martyr soldiers were freely pursued within GoSL territory as well. 
An Office of Great Heroes (maaveerar) was set up in 1995 and the head was an experienced grey-haired official whose no-nonsense capacities impressed me greatly when I met him briefly in Kilinochchi in 2004. The LTTE was well-served by the longstanding history of education in the Peninsula and such centres as Batticaloa several generational cohorts of public servants were available to implement its programmes. 
Tamil Eelam was also an innovative state. State-of-the-art underground hospitals had been constructed in Jaffna town in the early 1990s; while the underground complex built subsequently at Mullaitivu was impressive. Its innovative building of fast shallow water attack boats gave its Sea Tigers considerable clout as a brown water navy. Its commited suicide cadre in the Black Tigers sharpened the LTTEs raiding capacity as well as assassination work. The devastation of the Central Bank in Colombo Fort on 31 January 1996 and the Tamil commando strike on Katunayake airport on 24th July 2001 mark the capacity to inflict clinical assaults displayed by these personnel. 
My Ethnographic Experience in Kilinochchi in late November 2004
Through the good offices of Uthayam and guidance form Tamil friends I travelled south from Jaffna to Kilinochchi with these friends on the 26th November and in doing so passed through border controls typical maintained by the government of Sri Lanka and that of Tamil Eelam that were typical of all such practices world-wide (though not quite as mind-blowing as those I experienced at Check Point Charlie in Berlin in 1976). The first event I attended at Kilinochchi was the opening of a Media Centre on the 26th where Thamil Chelvam was the main speaker. However, my principal focus was the huge gathering of perhaps 150,000 people at the Kanagapuram Thuyilumilam south of the town who assembled at this temple in homage to their maaveerar on that sacred day, 27th November. 
The organisation at both events was exemplary. The arrangements on the 27th indicated attention to spatial requirements and participant comfort. Again, the restaurants in town and the bus services were state run and well-run. I was intrigued by the occasional scenes of cyclists and tractors bearing two coconut seedlings, apparently gifts to householders on that day the 27th November which would therefore boost the productive capacity of the smallholdings everywhere  a simple innovation, yet so useful. 
In conversations in English with two Health Department officials who joined our little party at meals and in interviewing Thiru Master (a senior LTTE counsellor and one of the speakers at the media event) at his house, I was peppered with complaints about GoSL activities. These men were feisty and itching to return to war. 
These experiences helped me understand a point dinned into my ears subsequently (2010) by Anoma Rajakaruna on the foundations provided by her frequent visits to Tamil Eelam on feminist projects during the ceasefire period 2002-06. The LTTE state, she said, had its fingers everywhere and most people were dependent on its arms in one way or another  sometimes in several ways. Muralidhar Reddy and Silan Kadirgamar were therefore on the ball when (in conversations with me in 2010) they insisted that in 2006-to-2008 most of the residents in LTTE terrain were hostile to GoSL and in support of the LTTEs diktats.
However, the LTTE and its supporters abroad always had larger territorial ambitions and its maps of the Eelam project were in step with the traditional homelands claim presented by the ITAK (Federal Party) from 1949 onwards  thereby embracing Puttalam and Chilaw in the expansive world-view typical of all fascist states in their embryonic stage
Nor must we forget that the LTTE had spent time and effort in regimenting the ordinary civilians in martial formations through the makkal padai training arrangements. Thus, a martial orientation had been instilled among the ordinary citizens. This was a state geared for war. One illustration of this commitment was provided by the sarong-clad manager of the guest house at which I was staying. He was an Indian Tamil from the Kandy locality whose family had migrated to the Vanni way back in the 1970s or so. His son had died as a Tiger fighter and there was a little shrine in the sons memory in the guest-house vestibule. The father  a middle-aged man, perhaps in his 50s  was unequivocal if the LTTE asked him to join their armed forces, he would gladly join. 
The Hallmarks of Sovereignty 
There is little doubt, therefore, that the Tiger leadership launched Eelam War IV in mid-2006 with a conviction that they could cap their existing paraphernalia of statehood with formal worldwide confirmation. 
The existing pillars of statehood included a little innovation on their part that also pointed to a shortfall. At some point in the past I do not have a date the LTTE had decreed that their clocks should not adhere to Sri Lanka time. All their clocks were adjusted to be one hour behind that of the standard SL time. (The SL time was adjusted one hour ahead and sometime later to half an hour ahead of the standard SL time as a move to save electricity during the Chandrika Kumaratunga government. It was subsequently abandoned.) 
However, this little sign highlights a fundamental shortfall. The currency in use in Tamil Eelam was the Sri Lankan rupee. I paid for my meals and bought books and disks at Kilinochchi with my stock of rupees. 
Why, then, had there been no change on this front answer because a significant number of residents in Tamil Eelam were either pensioners of the SL state or were serving officers in departments subject to directives from Colombo. They were recipients of pensions and or salaries from the government of Colombo. While dependent on Colombo in this manner, they took orders from the LTTE. 
Thus, one pillar of the LTTE economy was the cash flowing in regular fashion from the GoSL. That foundation, and its tell-tell sign, the ubiquitous Sri Lankan rupee, marked an outstanding shortfall; in fact, it was an Awful Sore on the forehead of the Tamil Eelam body politic. 
The LTTE state, moreover, drew some of its wherewithal in food supplies and medicinal needs from the stocks despatched to their citizens by the GoSL arms working in conjunction with UN and other humanitarian agencies. The government centred in Colombo was marking asserting its sovereign rights in this manner. The supplies were so useful that the LTTE chose to let them flow in. In this concession and in their continued dependence on the rupee as currency, they were conceding limits on the fullness of their statehood. 
That was not a major concern for talaivar Prabhakaran in 2006. Bolstered by past success, he and his commanders were certain that they would finalize their nation-status by waging war. Ramesh, the Tiger Propaganda Chief whom I met in Kilinochchi in November moved to Mullaitivu in December to prepare for this step. The ravages of the tsunami of 26th December that year delayed the move. However, the LTTE machinery of state regrouped and initiated Eelam War IV at Mavil Aru in August 2006.

UNP braces  for elections
	
The UNP is sending the message that the party is gearing up for the elections
It has become apparent that the election mode has been activated in the country. So to speak, the United National Party (UNP) has called for a meeting of its Kandy District electoral organization on September 9. It clearly sends the message that the party is gearing up for the elections. 
Normally, the district committees of political parties meet regularly like once a month. However, the district organizations are convened normally when crucial political events are on the cards. As such, it is obvious that the UNP is bracing for elections. 
Despite the UNPs obvious readiness to face such elections, uncertainty, however, prevails in political circles
	Probably, the UNP launched Enterprise Sri Lanka and Gamperaliya programmes bearing future elections in mind
	In another instance, the UNP MPs raised concern about the lack of cooperation from the local authorities
	The Ministers got the opportunity to have a good laugh at the Cabinet meeting
According to inside sources of the UNP, the party is getting ready for the provincial council elections to be conducted during the first quarter of next year. The party has already assigned its organisers to revive its grassroots level machinery in view of such upcoming elections. 
Already, the elections are overdue for three provincial councils- Sabaragamuwa, North-Central and Eastern Provincial Councils. Besides, Northern, North-Western and Central Councils will stand dissolved early next month. Then, the stage will be set for the elections to five out of the nine provincial councils in the country. 
Despite the UNPs obvious readiness to face such elections, uncertainty, however, prevails in political circles whether there would be any election prior to the presidential elections, scheduled at the end of 2019. Come what may, the Presidential Elections must be conducted by November, next year somehow or other unless the Constitution is amended to postpone them. It is a period stretching for a little more than one year.
Therefore, it is understandable for any political party to position itself politically now. 
Probably, the UNP launched Enterprise Sri Lanka and Gamperaliya programmes bearing future elections in mind. 
Under the Enterprise Sri Lanka programme, loans are issued at low-interest rates for entrepreneurs. In this instance, the Government only took the policy decision to release loans through the private and commercial banks. Loan approval is discretionary for the banking authorities depending on the eligibility of applicants. 
Granting of loans
This seems to have ruffled some UNP MPs. They have been under the impression that loans would be approved by the banking authorities on recommendations by area politicians representing the Government. So, they directed a question in this respect at the partys parliamentary group meeting last Monday. What is the purpose of giving loans if they dont give us any political mileage at the end one MP asked. 
State Minister of Finance Eran Wickramaratne briefed the MPs on the Enterprise Sri Lanka project in detail and said it was the discretion of the bankers to approve loans or not. He said it was a project aimed at improving entrepreneurship in Sri Lanka which is low compared to other countries in the region. 
He also asked the MPs to be mindful of the fact that only the depositors money was used by the banks in giving loans. He said the Government should ensure that the banking system would not suffer by giving loans on an ad hoc basis. 
The State Minister said these programmes should not be mixed up with the allocations for the projects outlined under the decentralised budget for MPs. 
Gamperaliya hindered by SLPP led local authorities
In another instance, the UNP MPs raised concern about the lack of cooperation from the local authorities in the implementation of the Gamperaliya programme. A bulk of the local authorities is controlled by Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP). The MPs said they faced practical problems in making Gamperaliya a success as a result. 
UNP to form broad alliance under new symbol with like-minded parties
Meanwhile, ahead of major elections, the political parties which are aligned with the UNP have proposed to form a broad alliance under a different name and a symbol and register it with the Election Commission. 
Basically, it was suggested by Sri Lanka Muslim Congress (SLMC) Leader Minister Rauff Hakeem, Tamil Progressive Alliance Leader Minister Mano Ganeshan and Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne. They have been together with the UNP under the banner United National Front (UNF). However, they have found that it is difficult to accommodate a party like Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) under the same political label. 
Accordingly, the proposal is to form a broad alliance similar to the political formation such as the United Peoples Freedom Alliance (UPFA). Most SLFP Ministers, who are currently with the Government, will be party to the proposed alliance. Recent political remarks by some of these SLFP ministers also point to such a political development. 
Agriculture Minister Mahinda Amaraweera, Irrigation Minister Duminda Dissanayake, Fisheries Minister Gamini Wijith Wijayamuni Zoisa are reportedly favouring a political understanding with the UNP under such a modality
Agriculture Minister Mahinda Amaraweera, Irrigation Minister Duminda Dissanayake, Fisheries Minister Gamini Wijith Wijayamuni Zoisa are reportedly favouring a political understanding with the UNP under such a modality. In recent times, going by their remarks, they have identified themselves more with the UNP albeit their political upbringing with the SLFP-led political force of the country. 
The Cabinet of Ministers set aside as much as 40 minutes to discuss about the protest rally that was to be conducted by the Joint Opposition yesterday. They stressed the need to use necessary force in case protestors disrupted order. 
Ladies do not like Mangala, says President
Despite all this, the Ministers got the opportunity to have a good laugh at the Cabinet meeting. That happened when Justice Minister Talatha Athukorale and Finance Minister Mangala Samaraweera were featured in an argument. Athukorale put forward a Cabinet paper requesting financial allocations to a certain project. But, Minister Samaraweera declined to allocate money for it. Despite the Ministers rejection, she kept pestering the Minister for financial allocation. And it prompted President Maithripala Sirisena to remark, It is typical of ladies to keep asking and asking,
Athukorale, in a jovial sense, turned to the President and complained against Samaraweera to the President. She said she was ill-treated by the Minister. 
Then, the President said, I know the ladies do not like Mangala, 
The entire Cabinet roared in laughter following the Presidents response.

Voice for Voiceless Foundation: A voice for those in need
	
Akash and Sumudu

The first two faces we look at as we see light in this world are those of our parents. But not every newborn goes through this fortunate experience. Although children are born to this world, many of them dont have a father or they dont have both parents. This could be due to various reasons and in most instances, children will be labelled as illegitimate. Akash was left at an orphanage when he was just two weeks old, while Sumudus home was an orphanage since she was two months old. Such were the beginnings of a duo that decided to be a voice for children who go through a similar fate through their foundation - Voice for the Voiceless.
Established four years ago with a vision to build a better Sri Lanka with Better Sri Lankans as mentioned in their slogan, Voice stands for Violence, Oppression, Injustice, Crime and Engage against. Hence their work has been categorized into five main streams including education, shelter, relief and rehabilitation, empowerment and skills development and advocacy. We prioritise on Voice against children because in most instances children dont have a voice, Akash said in an interview with Mirror for Hope. I grew up in an orphanage since I was two weeks old and my wife was left in an orphanage since she was two months old. By the age of 18 we have to leave the orphanage as per the law in our country which states that an individual is not a child after they reach the age of 18. After 18 I was homeless and I have sought shelter in bus stands and various other places. I then got to Colombo and started working at a factory in Kaduwela. Then I found a church in Rajagiriya and the pastor asked me to stay at his house. That was my home for the next seven years. He also gave his surname to me. However my wife did her A/Ls and studied home nursing and was working in a hospital in Kandy. But she was struggling with her finances while I already stabilized myself in Colombo. Therefore I asked her to come to Colombo and join the foundation. This is how we met.
Supporting children in Badulla
Akash wanted to help fellow children from falling into the gutters of society. When I told this to the pastor he got the Voice for Voiceless foundation registered and that is how it all started, he continued. We are mostly advocating on care-leavers  those who are leaving orphanages. Sadly nobody in the government knows how many children are at orphanages or the number of children that have left. But it is the responsibility of the state to make sure that these children are being taken care of. We also started a network called Generation Never Give up which is a combination of all care-leavers whom we are trying to connect.
95% of their funds are pooled in from Sri Lankans which also includes those living abroad. They have a shelter in Rajagiriya which houses children who have gone through abuse, those who are children of drug addicts etc. Akash further said that at Voice they look at a holistic picture where they help the child and also the parents. We have 34 children and apart from three families all other children are raised by single parents. We ask the parents to go and work without staying at home. In Colombo it is quite expensive for them to put a child in a daycare and instead they would lock a child up in a house and go to work. But in our safe-houses the children are safe but in return the parents have to work. This way we are helping the family to be self-sustained in the long run.
Over the past three years Akash and Sumudu have been going to Batticaloa and as a result of their visits they were able to setup an activity centre there. The Foundation has completed over 60 projects and they currently have 33 ongoing projects. They have also built a school in Pooneryn with the support of the 66th Brigade of the Sri Lanka Army. Akash and the team are also planning to build their second school in Eravur, Batticaloa. Other projects include Good Hope  womens empowerment project, Kilinochchi Ottrupulam Activity Centre and the Hambantota victory kids club. Along with that they support children and families in need.
The Foundation runs with the support of four permanent members and many volunteers who want to make a change.

White House slams Woodward book on Trump as fabricated stories
	

The White House dismissed Tuesday the veracity of a forthcoming book that paints a sobering picture of US President Donald Trumps senior aides and their frantic struggle to mitigate extreme policy decisions. 
Fear: Trump in the White House - based on interviews, meeting notes, personal diaries and government documents - was written by veteran Washington Post reporter Bob Woodward, who reported on the Watergate scandal that led to the resignation former US president Richard Nixon. 
As media outlets and Twitter users began circulating excerpts, the White House issued a statement denying its validity. 
This book is nothing more than fabricated stories, many by former disgruntled employees, told to make the president look bad, Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said. 
In a tweet, Trump said quotes from Secretary of Defence James Mattis, Chief of Staff John Kelly and other were made up frauds, a con on the public. 
He suggested Woodward was working for the Democrats, adding Notice timing American voters head to the polls in November for mid-term elections that could see Trumps Republican party lose control of Congress. 
According to Woodward, Trumps unpredictability and lack of understanding of global politics has left staffers distressed, prompted a nervous breakdown in the White House and led Kelly to consider the president unhinged. 
DPA, 05th
SEPTEMBER, 2018 



Revelations raise disturbing questions about Trump
REUTERS, 05th SEPTEMBER, 2018- U.S. President Donald Trump wanted to have Syrian President Bashar al-Assad assassinated last year but his defence secretary ignored the request, according to a new book that depicts top Trump aides sometimes disregarding presidential orders to limit what they saw as damaging and dangerous behaviour.
Excerpts from the book, Fear: Trump in the White House, written by famed Watergate reporter Bob Woodward, were published by the Washington Post on Tuesday. The book, which is scheduled for release on Sept. 11, is the latest to detail tensions within the White House under Trumps 20-month-old presidency.
Its just another bad book, Trump told the Daily Caller.
The Republican president said in a Twitter post that quotes in the book attributed to Defense Secretary James Mattis, White House Chief of Staff John Kelly and others were made up frauds, a con on the public.

Whither Janabalaya
	
The joint oppositions Janabalaya or Peoples power protest in Colombo yesterday appeared to be a success in terms of party politics. From early yesterday, on the streets of Colombo the number of vehicles was drastically reduced, in buses and trains the number of passengers was less. Several schools closed early and allowed the children to go home before the roads were blocked.
On Tuesday, the Cinnamon Gardens, Kollupitiya and Thalangama Police tried to obtain orders preventing the protest marches coming into Colombo, claiming it would cause inconvenience to the people among other reasons. But the Magistrates turned down the applications on the basis that if there was any threat to national security the police had a right to takepreventive action.
Ahead of the planned protest, the Cabinet announced it had endorsed the use of force by police if necessary such as in instances where violent protesters try to damage public property or attack the official residences of the President or the Prime Minister. By Tuesday more than 5,000 police personnel, including those summoned from outstations were kept on standby to face any any situation.
JO politicians complained they were deprived of a location to hold the protest by the Colombo Municipal Council (CMC). Till about 2.00 pm yesterday panicky people did not know which roads the protesters were going to block. Finally, later in the afternoon it was announced that the protest would be held at the Lake House junction, the main gateway to the Central bus stand in Pettah and the Fort Railway Station.
It is a political and democratic right to protest and every political party should have that right to do so. Yet there are questions about that right if the protest means causing disturbance to the people and disrupting the countrys economy
It is a political and democratic right to protest and every political party should have that right to do so. Yet there are questions about that right if the protest means causing disturbance to the people and disrupting the countrys economy. 
In recent decades, discipline and responsibility have gone into a state of depression in Sri Lanka. As we have stressed often in our editorial columns, rights are linked to responsibilities. Only to the extent we fulfil our responsibilities are we entitled to our rights. To the extent we fail in our responsibilities to be good and eco-friendly citizens, to that extent we forfeit our rights.
On January 8, 2015, when President Maithripala Sirisena changed the course of history by winning the presidential election and forming a coalition government with the United National Party (UNP) after the August 2015 parliamentary election, democracy and the rule of law have been restored to a large extent. However, opposition politicians claim that the government is only engaged in a witch hunt against them while ignoring other aspects of law and order.
Despite falls and failings, divisions and disputes an All-party Constitutional Council has been set up to regulate the working of the Public Services Commission, the National Police Commission, the Independent Elections Commission and the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption. Media Freedom has also being restored to a large extent with the right to information law being widely acclaimed as one of the most progressive acts of legislation since independence.
At the same time the infighting within the government leading to a cold war between the President and the Prime Minister has brought most sectors of the country to a standstill. The economy has taken a hit creating widely felt discontent among the population. Yesterdays protest as well as the drubbing received by the government at the local council polls indicate that it seriously needs to get its act together or else there would be further chaos inthe future.
Strikes and protests are part of democracy. But they should also not cause serious inconvenience to the people, mainly schoolchildren.
