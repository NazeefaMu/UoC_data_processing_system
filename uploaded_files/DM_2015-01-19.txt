Video: Police verifying fate of missing Presidential sec. vehicles
	
	The Police are yet to determine the fate and whereabouts of some 172 vehicles of the 752 fleet of the presidential secretariat, SSP Ajith Rohana said today.
	The new Presidential Secretary had informed the Police Chief to launch investigations to ascertain the number of vehicles of the secretariat and to find if the vehicles had been misused.
	The secretariat had received 379 vehicles by Sunday but 172 more vehicles have not been returned yet. Jeeps, cabs and cars were among the fleet of the Secretariat and some of these had been used by special advisors, the clergy and other individuals and also by state institutions, SSP Rohana said.
	He said a special CID team was probing the fate of the vehicles to determine if they have been misused. Using a state vehicle without permission and enjoying attached privileges such as fuel allowances was a punishable offence under the law, the SSP said. 
	He said the police would carry out raids to locate the vehicle if they had to. (Sanath Desmond)

Gota rejects account allegation
	
Former Defense Secretary Gotabaya Rajapaska yesterday rejected allegations of holding an account at the Bank of Ceylon Taprobane Branch with a balance of Rs.8 billion.
He said it was an official account set up with cabinet approval with the funds to be spent for the construction of the Army headquarters building at Pelawatta
Mr. Rajapaskas statement follows:
An allegation has been levelled against me that I have an account in the Taprobane Branch of the Bank of Ceylon with a balance of Rs.8 billion. This is grossly misleading and appears to discredit my reputation with ulterior motive. As I know there is an Operational Account held with the Bank of Ceylon Taprobane Branch dedicated for the use of financing the construction of Army headquarters building at Pelawatta. This account was created with the Approval of the Cabinet from the revenue from the sale of land at Galle Face, Colombo where the Army headquarters was located. After the relocation and construction work was started, withdrawals were to be made from it based on the progress of the construction work undertaken by various contractors and suppliers. The account is operated by the Chief Accountant and other authorized officials of the Ministry of Defence under the overall supervision of the Secretary of Defence.
All cheques are issued with two signatures upon the receipts of certified payment vouchers. As I recall, the Account was open with the total receipts of about Rs.20 billion in 2011 and withdrawals have been made each year thereafter for the payment of certified claims from contractors. Names and signatures of Authorized persons are available with the Bank and chief Accountant of the ministry. The balance as at the last day of my holding office was certainly over Rs.8 billion. The figures can be verified from the Treasury as annual deposit balance is reported to the Government balance Sheet.
As I have ceased to be the Secretary to the Ministry of Defence, my successor is the automatic custodian of that Account and he can verify all these. My name appears in the signature card in my capacity as secretary Defence along with other authorized officials and hence it has nothing to do with my personal account. Therefore, there is no truth whatsoever that I have a personal account in the Bank of Ceylon with Rs.8 billion. I deny this completely and request the Secretary to verify this with the bank and the Treasury and disclose the correct situation on this account.

Bar to give CJ44 the cold shoulder
	
The ongoing controversy and demand for Chief Justice 44, Mohan Peiris to resign ,took another turn as the Attorney Generals Department informed the Chief Justice not to attend todays grand ceremony to mark the 130th anniversary of Sri Lankas Attorney Generals Department.
The AGs decision came following Saturdays Bar Association of Sri Lanka (BASL) Executive Council resolution, the Daily Mirror reliably learns. At the meeting the BASL Ex-Co has decided to walk out if CJ Peiris attended the ceremony. BASL head Upul Jayasuriya told the Daily Mirror, that at Saturdays meeting they had decided to walk out from the BMICH venue as a mark of protest if Mr. Peiris was seen there. This decision has already been conveyed to Attorney General Yuvanjana Wijeyetilleke, Mr. Jayasuriya said.
Symbolically I will go there but if Mohan Peiris attends the function I will have to walk out. Likewise several senior Presidents Counsel have informed the Bar that they would do so, Mr. Jayasuirya said.
Mr. Jayasuriya said he had conveyed the decision to the AG and in turn the AG had conveyed about its decision to the CJ indicating that he should not come there. The BASL has repeatedly urged CJ Peiris to resign from his position and stated it has lost confidence in the credibility of the CJ to continue to function in that position. (Susitha R. Fernando)

The Police would get fingerprints from the seized sports car seized from a house in Piliyandala on Sunday to ascertain the previous user of the vehicle, Police Spokesman SSP Ajith Rohana said.
A sports car (Nissan GT-R) with no ownership documentation was seized from a house at Rathana Mawatha in Makuluduwa, Piliyandala Sunday morning and the residents of the house were unable to provide proper documentation of the vehicle.
The residents claimed that the car was brought by a friend on the way to sell it but their statements contradict with the statement of the others,Rohana said.
Therefore, we will find for the fingerprints on the car as the fingerprints of the previous user should be on the surfaces, he told a news conference at the Police Headquarters in Colombo. 
The fingerprints might reveal clues on the user or people connected to it and be helpful to trace the owner, he said. 
The SSP said the registration number on the car (WP KE-1392) was false and no such vehicle had been registered under the said number at the Motor Traffic Department. 
He said the vehicle had been modified by a resident of Minuwangoda. 
We will ask for a report on this regard from the Commissioner of Motor Traffic, SSP Rohana said. (Lahiru Pothmulla and Sanath Desmond)

Northern Expressway suspended
	
	Review underway to know real cost
	The government has decided to suspend the execution of the northern expressway project initiated by the previous regime, till its cost effectiveness is fully checked, a minister said yesterday.
	 
	Before the presidential election, then President Mahinda Rajapaksa ceremonially launched the project which was to be carried out under a loan agreement with China. The highway was due to link Colombo with Kandy via Kurunegala, and then Dambulla.
	The new Finance Minister, Ravi Karunanayake, said though such ceremonies were conducted to inaugurate the project, nothing had actually been done on the ground with regard to its implementation.
	The Minister told Daily Mirror that costs appeared to have been inflated in most development projects, either executed or in the pipeline, and therefore it would be better to have a full-scale review to ascertain the cost in real terms. The cost has been estimated with corruption added on. We have to reduce root out corruption for more development work to be carried out with the funds available. The estimated cost is double the size of the actual cost in certain cases, he said. 
	Besides, the Minister said the new government had decided to stop payments for various dubious transactions committed during the previous regime. 
	For instance, he said, 770 double cabs had been imported to the country during the last week of December purported to be used in election related work. We will sell these vehicles to the public now. Likewise, over 1800 vehicles were lying at the Presidential Secretariat. As a policy, we decided to use these vehicles for our duty related work without importing new ones, he said.

Therefore, the promise given to the people should be fulfilled, he told journalists after visiting patients at the Army Hospital in Narahenpita
	Meanwhile, he said if DP Parliament Member Jayantha Ketagoda who crossed over to the United Peoples Freedom Alliance (UPFA) resigned, the vacant seat should be given to the DP.
	Mr. Ketagoda had not informed me about any decision to resign from parliament. However, the seat belongs to our party. We will have to adhere to election regulations on appointing a DP member be it me or someone else, Mr. Fonseka said.
	He said his service to the people will continue whether he was appointed an MP or not. Mr. Fonseka said he took two years and nine months to defeat terrorism while it took only two years and eight months to defeat the previous regime.
