ComBank Bangladesh receives AAA rating for 5th consecutive year
	
		 		 
		 
			
The AAA (Triple A) long-term credit rating accorded to the Bangladesh operations of Commercial Bank PLC has been reaffirmed by Credit Rating Information and Services Ltd (CRISL) for the fifth consecutive year.
Triple A is the highest credit rating given to any financial institution in Bangladesh by CRISL.
The rating is based on the financial performance of Commercial Bank up to December 31, 2014 and other qualitative and quantitative information relevant to the rating. This includes the bank?s continuous maintenance of strong fundamentals in the area of capital adequacy, asset quality, financial and operating efficiency and risk management.
Commercial Bank?s Bangladesh operations, now comprising of 18 service points and 19 ATMs, were upgraded from AA + (Double A Plus) to AAA in July 2011. This rating has remained unchanged since. Commercial Bank is the third largest foreign bank in Bangladesh.
Banks in the triple A category are adjudged to be of best quality, offer highest safety and have highest credit quality. Risk factors are negligible and risk free, nearest to risk-free Government bonds and securities. Changing economic circumstances are unlikely to have any serious impact on this category of banks.
?The success of our Bangladesh operation is a great source of inspiration, confidence and encouragement to us,? Commercial Bank?s Managing Director/CEO Jegan Durairatnam said. ?Commercial Bank Bangladesh has won numerous awards in that country, and has been a solid representation of the values and strengths of the parent bank. We have now ventured into Myanmar, and our experience in Bangladesh will be of value to the Myanmar team.??
For the purpose of the rating, CRISL has evaluated the financial performance of the Commercial Bank in terms of Return on Average Assets (ROAA), Return on Average Equity (ROAE) and Net Interest Margin (NIM). At end 2014, the net profit before tax and provisions of Commercial Bank Bangladesh stood at TK. 1,631million while net profit after tax was TK. 947million.
Commercial Bank entered Bangladesh in July 2003 with the acquisition of the Bangladesh operations of Credit Agricole Indosuez (CAI), its first ever acquisition of a banking operation. The Bank has been honoured with the ?Best Corporate Performance? Award under the Foreign Bank category for the past six years consecutively in Bangladesh by the Institute of Cost and Management Accountants of Bangladesh (ICMAB).
In Sri Lanka, Commercial Bank operates a network of 243 branches and 613 ATMs and is the country?s largest private bank. Ranked the most valuable private sector brand in the country in 2014, the Bank was adjudged the Best Bank in Sri Lanka by FinanceAsia in 2015.

EC says can't reduce MR's security
	
	Election Commissioner Mahinda Deshapriya today ruled out the legal possibility for him to reduce the security and other privileges assigned to Mahinda Rajapaksa as the former President despite him being a candidate at the upcoming polls contesting from the Kurunegala district under the UPFA.
	Addressing a news conference, Mr. Deshapriya made this remark in response to UNP Candidate and Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam who complained about the possible abuse of such privileges by Mr. Rajapaksa in the run up to the election as a rival candidate.
	?I respect the right of Mr. Kariyawasam to bring this to my notice. I hope the personnel assigned in the security detail of that particular candidate will not do their duty without involving in election propaganda. If there is involvement in any election related activity, it can be looked into. Otherwise, I cannot order the reduction of privileges guaranteed to any candidate by the law because of the positions they hold,? he said.
	He said the Cabinet Ministers, the Deputy and State Ministers, the Speaker and the members of the Constitutional Council were entitled to certain benefits such as security under certain legal provisions, and he could not dispute them as per the law.
	Yet, the Elections Commissioner said he took steps to withdraw security provided to former MPs contesting this election under an agreement struck with political party leaders at a meeting.
	He said it was done to ensure a level playing field for all candidates, barring those entitled to such rights under the law.
	?I have to be equal to all in my dealings as the Election Commissioner. It is unfair to point fingers at me for withdrawing security. Be they from major parties or small parties, a level playing field is needed in the run up to the election. If I give any special treatment to the candidates from main parties, others can sue me. Otherwise, I did not withdraw security of the former MPs with malice,? he said.
	However, the Commissioner said the candidates, with threats on their lives, could seek special security arrangements from the Inspector General of Police (IGP) and the Ministry of Public Order.
	?Then, I should be informed in writing. After an analysis of intelligence reports, special arrangements can be made for the security of such candidates,? he said. (Kelum Bandara)

For all those who worked at Sampath Bank at whatever stage of its evolution the Bank has always remained near and dear their hearts and is always remembered with great affection. The excellent grounding received and the positive encouragement to achieve highest professional standards will be remembered with gratitude. The ?family? feeling and the caring ? culture with the ?respect for the individual? as the most important key value will endure among the Sampath fraternity till the very end.

Video: Excise revenue had increased - Ravi K
	
	The Excise Department had collected a monthly revenue of Rs. 9,900 million as fines in April this year while it had only collected Rs. 3,300 million as fines in November last year under the rule of the previous government, Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake said today.
	?
	He said the revenue collected in April this year is a clear indication to prove that the Department had increased its revenue during the rule of the new government.
	?
	?It is a question of what happened to the extra Rs. 6,000 million of monthly income during the previous government. Also, the previous government had given some 428 liquor licenses while we had given only 28,? the minister told a news briefing held at the ministry.
	?
	Meanwhile, he refuted the claims by the Opposition members of the previous parliament that the government had imported a number of containers filled with ethanol and had secretly released them.
	?
	He said they had only detained one container of ethanol and said the names of the importers would be revealed in the near future.
	?
	Minister Karunanayake also refused the claims by former governor of the Central Bank, Ajith Nivard Cabraal that the country's gross official reserves had been decreased.
	?
	?I challenge him for a debate so we can prove these allegations are fabrications,? he said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

I have worked honestly as a member of the Western Provincial Council. I never resorted to asking for 10% commissions from contracts. I never demanded ransoms, or asked for gratification for admitting children to schools. I know the value of money and the cost involved in contesting. My father has always encouraged me saying whatever comes my way, we will even sell what we have and conduct the elections and even if we are driven onto the road, I can assure you that i did not enter politics to earn money", she said.
	She rebuked all those who are involved in vices who had entered the contest, by getting their names into the lists, and warned the people to be extremely careful in exercising their franchise and refrain from voting for these corrupt individuals. (Indika Sri Aravinda)

Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) members should decide whether they were going to support President Maithripala Sirisena, who had made his stance clear, to continue with his good governance policies, said Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.
Mr Wickremesinghe said at an election rally in Katana today that the president had clearly opposed the candidature of his predecessor and that the SLFPers had been confused by his stance. "Can a confused lot govern the country?" he asked.
He said President Sirisena had actually given a slap to the SLFP general secretary by getting a restraining order regarding the SLFP central committee meeting.
He said the SLFP had become a joke with one section calling for a central committee meeting and the other stopping it.
Many election pledges were given by Mr Wickremesinghe, who said the party would announce more plans it had made for the country.
Minister Arjuna Ranatunga, who lashed out at the UPFA, said he and some others decided to leave it as they could no longer associate with robbers. (Yohan Perera)

Union Assurance? current valuation exceeds Rs. 2.39bn
	
		 		 
		 
			
For close to three decades, Union Assurance has been a trusted name in the insurance sector in Sri Lanka. As a result of its continuous growth the company, currently valued at Rs. 2.39 bn. has managed to maintain net earnings from insurance premiums between 1st January 2014 to 31st December 2014, valued at Rs. 5.9 billion.?
Additionally, financial records from the varied Union Assurance verticals support this strong growth.
Assistant General Manager, Marketing and Distributions, Dharshana Amarasinghe stated, ?the promise of ?trust? are more than just words to the Union Assurance family. It is the cornerstone of all Company undertakings, and that is the reason for the Company?s success. The insurance business is extremely complex. In order to be successful, all stakeholders need build and maintain trust among each other. We ensure that all our dealings are transparent, and we provide our customers with superior service, ease and respect ? this is how we ensure that our promise of ?trust? is being delivered.?
Union Assurance is constantly taking steps to introduce product and service innovations to their customers, such as the recently re-introduced ?Union Challenger? plan. ?The Union Challenger Plan is an investment plan with a life insurance policy, and is a stable foundation from which to build a future.?
?However, we are not satisfied with merely introducing new solutions. We are taking steps to educate the nation about the importance of insurance and investment. To this aim we are using electronic and print media, as well as external publicity campaigns. Social media is also playing a pivotal role in this regard. ?The fact that at this time, our Facebook page has the second largest following in the Insurance sector, is evidence of this fact,? Mr. Amarasinghe continued.?
Union Assurance is constantly updating the skills and potential of their staff through various training programmes. At the same time, the Company prides itself in being able to create an environment that is conducive to growth and learning. This is a key reason behind the success of Union Assurance. In recognition of this fact, we were recognized recently, for the third consecutive time, by the prestigious Great Places to Work organization. ?We are constantly striving to recruit talented members to our staff carder. Union Assurance recently launched the ?Month of Victory? programme is a key example,? Amarasinghe added.?
All these factors considered, Union Assurance has managed to claim 14 percent of the insurance market in Sri Lanka. The Company has managed to surpass its competitors and earn an AA- rating, valued at Rs. 2.39 billion. This is evidence for the fact that Union Assurance will continue to go from strength to strength in the future.?
In addition, the Company is constantly engaged in community service projects. Amongst these projects, dengue eradication, and awareness raising relating to the Thalassaemia disease, take precedent. Through these programmes the Company has played a crucial role in educating a large number of people and preventing the spread of potentially deadly diseases among many more.?
?Union Assurance is not just a business. It is a part of its stakeholders? lives. It is, as a result, an exemplary organization ? a benchmark for its competitors. All things considered, there is not doubt that the value of the company will continue to grow in the future,? Amarasinghe added.?

Video: MR should be defeated :JVP
	
The government of the SLFP and UNP headed by President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe had failed to take effective steps to put an end to ?Rajapaksa political culture?, the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) said today. ?
JVP Leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake said the defeated Rajapaksa politics had been revived, while the new government was focused on achieving their narrow political gains.
?They should have wiped out the Rajapaksa politics, when he began the revival, with spreading racism. If this need was accomplished earlier, President Sirisena would not have been pushed into the present political chaos,? he told a news conference.
He said former President Mahinda Rajapaksa did not allow anyone to succeed him and converted the SLFP into a ?Rajapaksa party?.
?After the two terms of office of Presidency of Chandrika Bandaranaike, Rajapaksa was able to become the President. Later, he amended the Constitution after holding two terms of Presidency so he could become the President for a third time,? Mr. Dissanayake said.
He said Rajapaksa still attempted to grab the power by contesting for Premiership and said if the SLFP to be saved, people should vote against him.
?We urge the SLFPers to join us to defeat Rajapaksa. Mahinda?s rise is the end of the SLFP. Today the SLFP is not controlled by its Central Committee but by a small faction. Rajapaksa should be defeated the same way President Sirisena wanted,? he said. (Sanath Desmond)

Video: Susil comments on enjoining order
	
UPFA General Secretary Susil Premajayantha said today the enjoining order issued by the District Court against the UPFA Central Committee had been obtained without knowing the facts as the petitioner was immature.
?We had earlier decided to have a meeting of the Executive meeting of the SLFP at 4.00 pm and informed party leader President Sirisena. But he instructed us to postpone it and we agreed. There was no move to convene the Central Committee today after that meeting,? he said.
Explaining the election propaganda slogan of the UPFA, ?Let?s Power the Nation ? Let?s Start Afresh? Mr. Premajayantha claimed the country was weakened and failed in the last six months under the minority UNP government and therefore the people and the country needed an empowerment and rejuvenation afresh. He said the UPFA would take the country to new heights after August 17 under a government formed by Mahinda Rajapaksa.
Sri Lanka was a strong and prosperous nation under Rajapaksa with new found peace after the war victory against the LTTE and with massive development drive launched island wide by the UPFA government. But development came to a standstill, thousands of employees lost jobs and foreign investment has ground to a drop in the last six months, he alleged.

Video: Will sustain the January revolution - Gayantha
	
	The statement made by President Maithripala Sirisena on Tuesday had cleared the people's minds and it would pave the way for a Parliament, which would sustain the January 8 revolution, the United National Party (UNP) said.
	UNP Spokesman and UNFGG candidate Gayantha Karunatilaka told a media briefing that President's action to let people know his stand on the political situation, would certainly help him and all those who wanted political reform and freedom.
	He said the action of the previous UPFA regime to divide political parties had boomeranged today.
	Karunathilaka, who came up with details on the plans, which a UNP led government had, said the country's largest conference hall would be constructed in Bentara, Elpitiya.
	He said the largest conference hall in the country was to be built at Temple Trees premises during the last regime.
	In addition he said the coastal line from Bentota and Mirissa would be converted into a tourism zone
	He said the manifesto of the UNFGG would be launched in the coming days. (Yohan Perera and Chaturanga Predeep)
