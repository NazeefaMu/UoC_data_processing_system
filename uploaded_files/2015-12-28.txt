GMOA tells Finance Minister to resign
	
Government doctors today called for the resignation of Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayaka in the wake of even President Maithripala Sirisena reportedly saying that the budget proposals had placed the government in a difficult position.
Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) Dr. Naveen De Soyza told the media that when they met President Sirisena he had said the 2016 Budget had created unnecessary problems for the government.
?Citing one instance of arbitrary budget decisions by Mr. Karunanayaka, the President said he was not consulted when the emission test fee for motor vehicles was increased to Rs.5,000 or tax on electric cars being increased to Rs. 25,000 despite being the Environment Minister,? he said.
He hit out saying that Minister Karunanayaka must tender his resignation immediately as he was not fit to hold that portfolio after committing all these blunders and added that the changes and amendments made to the budget too numerous to count.
?If the GMOA was compelled to resort to trade union action by ignoring our demands, it will be decisive and indefinite. We will not step back as long as the government refuses to meet all our demands,? Dr. De Soyza said.
He said it appeared that the entire budget had been prepared only by Minister Karunanayaka and had not consulted even Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and that was why the President and Prime Minister had to intervene to change a majority of the proposals to minimize the damage and the public anger.
He said the GMOA smelt something fishy in the whole affair and it could be termed as an attempt to topple the government and alleged that if there was a conspiracy against the government, Finance Minister Karunanayaka must be the flag bearer. (Sandun A Jayasekera)

LG polls in June 2016 after amendments
	
The Local Government and Provincial Councils Ministry expects to enact amendments to the local government electoral system before the expiry of office of remaining 23 local government bodies by April 2016, enabling the government to call local government polls in June, a senior official source said yesterday.
Secretary of the Local Government and Provincial Councils, Kamal Pathmasiri while expressing his deep satisfaction over the government?s decision to postpone local government polls by another six months told Daily Mirror that the Ministry expects to consider all important and acceptable proposals submitted by the public, civil society and political parties and incorporate amendments accordingly to the local government electoral reforms.
Mr. Pathmasiri said the Local Government and Provincial Councils have already identified 31 amendments to be incorporated in the Local Government.
?Our main concern was to attend to nearly 2,000 petitions that had been sent by a cross section of the society including political parties in disagreement with the National De-limitation Commission recommendations to the five member committee headed by Mr. Asoka Peiris. Now that the government has postponed the office of 23 local government bodies until June 30 and thereby effectively the local government polls, we have ample time to finish the job at least by May,? Mr. Pathmasiri said. (Sandun A Jayasekera)

Mahela, Sanga to compensate fans
	
	Former Cricketers Kumar Sangakkara and Mahela Jayawardena who are the board members of Live Events Sri Lanka, have decided to compensate the fans due to the shortcomings at the Enrique Iglesias concert recently staged in Colombo.
	The decision has been made public in a joint statement of Mahela and Sangakkara via their Facebook accounts.The full statement
	Dear Enrique Ticket Holders,
	We wish to apologise to all of you for your negative experience at the recently concluded Enrique Concert. Although both of us were overseas fulfilling cricket commitments, we were shocked and saddened to hear of the events that transpired. It is extremely disappointing for us that this event, organised to assist the development of Sri Lanka as a tourist and entertainment hub and provide the public with exceptional entertainment of a high standard by accessing celebrated international artists, turned out in this manner. We are issuing this statement today, after understanding all circumstances and the facts.
	When the idea was pitched to us and other investors by the organisers to bring an artist such as Enrique to Sri Lanka, we backed it in all good faith expecting a stellar event delivered in a professional manner to the public of Sri Lanka. Although we realised that such a venture will be an arduous one due to the well-known challenges and market restraints of organising such large-scale events in Sri Lanka, we were willing to support this endeavour considering the rich experience and the image-building potential for Sri Lanka?s tourism. As such, all required resources - both financial and otherwise - were made available to the organizers to ensure the desired outcome.
	Unfortunately, the event has fallen far short of these expectations. Although we believe that the organising team worked tirelessly and with good intentions to ensure a well-run event, there have clearly been glaring mistakes made, for which responsibility needs to be taken.
	Firstly, although the delay of the artist and some equipment arriving at the venue, which caused the subsequent delay in opening the gates to usher in the public, for which the artist responsibly and graciously apologized, was beyond the control of the organizers, the communication of this to the public was mishandled, thereby inconveniencing people greatly. Those that stood patiently in-line for hours were not extended the courtesy of being informed of the ground situation. This at the very beginning would have frustrated and angered all of you.
	Secondly, although a professional security company was hired and protocols were put in place to ensure the safety and the comfort of all, we have been made well-aware that these measures were inadequate when faced with the challenges of controlling such a large gathering, and failed alarmingly. This obviously undermined the overall experience for those who purchased premium tickets by their respective space being encroached upon by others, and we fully understand their disappointment and anger. The premium price paid by them for their tickets needs to be respected and their comfort and viewing experience should have been safeguarded, which is under the direct purview of the organizers.
	The organizers are in agreement, with our direction, that such shortcomings must not be tolerated. As such, we have informed them that an apology in itself is not sufficient, but further appropriate compensation has to be made in the form of a suitable refund, irrespective of the financial loss to us.
	With regards to recent reports concerning Live Events and Municipal entertainment taxes, we categorically state the company remains transparent and ethical in all operations.
	Live Events will continue to ensure full compliance with all relevant tax commitments and is providing all necessary information to the Colombo Municipal Council, in order to clarify facts and the way forward. Accountability and integrity is paramount to us and we believe it to be the same for the organizers.
	Although we know an apology or refund cannot fully satiate your disappointment, we wish to reiterate that we remain fully committed to all of you and our country. As such, a full and thorough internal inquiry is ongoing into all areas of concern.
	Kumar Sangakkara and Mahela Jayawardena.

Sumanthiran hits out at Vigneswaran
	
	TNA Parliamentarian M.A. Sumanthiran said the TNA friendly people were being led astray by Chief Minister of Northern Province C.V. Vigneswaran.
	Commenting on the Tamil People?s Council established recently under the Chief Minister, the parliamentarian told the media during the Tsunami commemoration in Jaffna that the Tamil community would not desert the TNA or its leadership. He pointed out that they would take a decision on the politicians who attempt to overlook the TNA. The parliamentarian said the Tamil People?s Committee was a clear indication of the Chief Minister?s anti-TNA movement.
	Meanwhile, TNA leader R. Sampanthan and the Chief Minister had met at the TNA?s Legal Advisor K.Kanageshwaran?s residence in Bambalapitiya to sort out the differences. Although the media was not allowed the cover the meeting, the Chief Minister told the media that the talks were a success.
	However, the TNA leader said that the talks were based on the Tamil Peoples? Council. He said the Chief Minister was a public representative just as the members of the TNA and that they discussed on their responsibility to fulfil the aspirations of the people. (Romesh Madusanka)

Enrique show: Udaya asks MS to whip the organisers
	
Pivithuru Hela Urumaya (PHU) General Secretary Udaya Gammanpila today asked President Maithripala Sirisena to order the whipping of the organisers of the recent Enrique Iglesias concert.
He said it was the President who had the authority to order such a whipping.
Mr. Gammanpila told a media conference that the environment which made a woman under the influence of liquor throw her underwear on the stage should be investigated.
?As far as I am concerned, drinking alcohol in public is prohibited but distributing and selling them in public is not illegal according to Sri Lanka?s regulations. The President should be responsible in preventing such indecent concerts taking place in the country in the future,? he said.
He said when there were more westernized countries than Sri Lanka in the Asian continent why did the particular singer select Sri Lanka to perform his concert.
Mr. Gammanpila claimed that this was because there was a serious 'sexual demand? among Sri Lanka?s younger generation.
Meanwhile, he said he would declare a black flag week from January 2 to 8 to mark the election of President Sirisena.
Mr. Gammanpila asked all motorists to display black flags during the week to show their objection to the President and the government.
He said if someone was scared of black defenders, black flags could be made their Facebook profile pictures. (Piyumi Fonseka)

Why can't Hirunika kidnap Duminda?: Madhu
	
	Popular singer Madhumadawa Aravinda today asked MP Hirunika Premachandra to kidnap former UPFA MP Duminda Silva in her black defender to hear the case of her father Bharatha Lakshman Premachandra?s murder in her own court in her own style if she had courage to stand against his father?s murderer as claimed by her.
	Responding to a recent statement of Ms. Premachandra who had aggressively criticized a particular media institution for having links with her father?s murderer, Mr. Aravinda asked her to stand against Mr. Premachandra?s murder without meddling into domestic quarrels of husbands and wives.
	?She came to politics in an emotional way crying over her father?s death. As such if she is brave enough to act against injustice using her own kind of judiciary system where she claims to be an attorney at law, why cannot she kidnap MP Duminda Silva as claimed by her? She might be arrested for kidnapping a man, yet she would have stood for her father,? he said. (Piyumi Fonseka)
