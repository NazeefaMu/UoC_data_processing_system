SL earns over USD 161mn from UN peacekeeping
	
The Sri Lanka Army has earned more than USD 161 million from UN peacekeeping missions since 2004, Army Commander Lieutenant General Mahesh Senanayake said on Thursday.
?He said this at the opening ceremony of the Directorate for Overseas Operations (DOO) at the Old Dutch Building in Colombo 3.
?Since 2004, Sri Lanka has been earning a minimum of USD 2.5 million per annum from peacekeeping missions overseas. The troops deployed for such assignments benefit financially and through these undertakings, the country amasses foreign remittances that are utilised to train more and more soldiers. Since 1955, a number of 18,179 members attached to the Sri Lanka Army have extended their invaluable services to UN peacekeeping missions. The contingents are currently engaged in peacekeeping missions in Lebanon (UNIFIL), South Sudan (UNMISS), Mali (MINUSMA), Abyei (UNISFA), New York (UNHQ), Central African Republic (MINUSCA) and Western Sahara (MINURSO), either as military observers, staff officers or officer assistants or general contingent troops,? he said.
The DOO Defence Secretary declared open the ?Mansion of Peace? (Sama Madura) building at the complex, which is established to handle international peacekeeping and overseas operational commitments under the Director General, Staff Branch.
?Our vision towards world peace is to contribute an effective combat outfit under the United Nations to achieve sustainable peace in conflict zones. Fast changing political dynamics have become a complex and multi-dimensional challenge,? the Army Commander said.
Earlier, the UN Department of Peacekeeping Operations (DPKO) insisted that feasible clearance for such deployments should be sought from the Sri Lankan Human Rights Commission (SLHRC) by vetting respective overseas bound UN candidates before their departure. Meanwhile, DG of the Directorate for Overseas Operations, Major General Mervyn Perera said future peacekeeping deployments, training and other activities related to overseas operations would be handled by the DOO.(Darshana Sanjeewa)

US, UK and France launch air strikes in Syria
	
The US, UK and France have launched air strikes against alleged Syrian chemical weapons facilities in response to chemical weapons attack in a Damascus suburb a week ago, the Guardian reported a short while ago.
The Pentagon said the air strikes, which began at 4am Syrian time, involved planes and ship-launched missiles, more than a hundred weapons in all.
Officials named three targets: a scientific research centre in Damascus, a chemical weapons storage facility west of Homs and another storage site and command post nearby.
?Right now, we have no additional attacks planned. This is a one-time shot,? US defence secretary James Mattis said.
However, in a televised address from the White House earlier to announce the strikes, Donald Trump said the US and its allies would strike again if there were more chemical weapons attacks by the regime of Bashar al-Assad.
?We are prepared to sustain this response until the Syrian regime stops its use of prohibited chemical agents,? he said.
Referring to last Saturday?s chemical weapons attack reported to have killed over 70 people, Trump said. ?These are not actions of a man, they are crimes of a monster instead.?
After Trump finished his seven-minute address, Theresa May and Emmanuel Macron made separate announcements of British and French participation, stressing that the strikes were limited to Syrian regime chemical facilities, and had no wider goals.
Explosions were reported in Damascus moments after Trump?s address.
The Russian ambassador to Washington, Anatoly Antonov, has issued a statement threatening ?consequences?.
?A pre-designed scenario is being implemented. Again, we are being threatened. We warned that such actions will not be left without consequences. All responsibility for them rests with Washington, London and Paris,? Antonov?s statement said.
The Pentagon said in the immediate aftermath of the strikes that while there had been some Syrian air defence fire, it was not clear whether Russian air defences in Syria had gone into action.
