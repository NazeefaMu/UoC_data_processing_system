Ban tuition classes on Sundays: Cardinal Ranjith
	
Archbishop of Colombo Malcolm Cardinal Ranjith yesterday said he had requested President Maithripala Sirisena in writing to ban tuition classes on Sundays at least for several hours.
Cardinal Ranjith who was addressing the Catholic Teachers Day programme at St Josephs College Colombo last morning said he had written to President Maithripala Sirisena requesting him to ban tuition classes on Sundays at least for several hours.
I wrote to President recently and made this request as I have found out that children do not have the time to go to temple or two the Church on Sundays because of tuition classes, he said.
I have seen school children in uniform at bus stands with their books even during late hours. Even small children in grade four or five go to tuition classes today.
We during our childhood used to run to the playground straight after school but today children go to tuition classes. They do not get a chance to enjoy their childhood because of busy lifestyles they lead today, he added.
Further, Cardinal Ranjith said the school van mafia, which prevails today puts extra pressure on parents who are already carrying a heavy burden on funding their childrens education. These school vans he said charged heavy fees.
The head of the Sri Lankan Church also said schools and teachers face more challenges today than ever before when it comes to bringing up citizens with good moral values. (Yohan Perera)

Constitution making: BASL drops German NGO after protest
	
Following protest by some members, the Bar Association of Sri Lanka (BASL) had decided to withhold any assistance from a German NGO for its awareness programme on Constitution making, an official said.
Democracy Reporting International (DRI), a German NGO, offered to assist the Bar Association in the conduct of awareness seminars on the present Constitution making process.
Presidents Counsel Manohara de Silva, who was one of the speakers at a seminar organised by the BASL and the DRI, has raised the matter.
Asked about it BASL Chairman U.R. De Silva said the DRI offered assistance to conduct the programme, and the BASL accepted it. However, he said there were objections from some members against its involvement. Otherwise, he said the DRI never tried to impose its agenda on the BASL.
Mr. De Silva said the BASL counted on its resource persons to carry out awareness seminars.
Otherwise, it never tried to force its way on us, he said. (Kelum Bandara)

European arrest warrant is issued for ousted leader
	

A judge in Madrid has jailed eight former Catalan regional ministers behind the failed independence bid over fears they will attempt to fleethe country.
The Deputy First Minister and seven of his senior colleagues were taken to a jail on the outskirts of the capital Madrid after appearing before the Spanish High Court to answer charges of sedition, rebellion and misuse ofpublic funds.
The regions former leader Carles Puigdemont  who fled to Brussels with four of his colleagues on Monday  tweeted: A long and fierce repression awaits us.
A European arrest warrant was issued for Puigdemont along with the four others who failed to turn up in Madrid, newspaper LaVanguardia said.
Puigdemonts lawyer said his client would fully co-operate with Belgian authorities and was expecting a drawn-out extradition fight.
The Catalan ministers were sacked from their positions after the Spanish Government invoked Article 155 to seize control of the regional Government following an illegal referendum
on independence.
Those jailed overnight include the vice president Oriol Junqueras, Home Affairs Minister Joaquim Form, Foreign Affairs Minister Raul Romeva, Governance, Meritxell Borras, Presidency Jordi Tull, Social Affairs Minister Dolores Bassa, Justice Minister Carles Mundo and Terrotory Minister

Ex-PM Sharif returns to Pakistan for  court hearing
	

Pakistans ousted prime minister Nawaz Sharif appeared in court on Friday, a day after returning from overseas to face corruption allegations that saw him ejected from office and targeted with an arrest warrant. 
In a brief hearing in Islamabad, Sharif paid two surety bonds of five million rupees ($48,000) each before leaving under tight security, his lawyer Khawaja Haris told AFP. 
The court is set to reconvene on November 7. 
The former premier, who was forced out by the Supreme Court in July over a scandal kindled by the Panama Papers leak, had been facing an arrest warrant for failing to appear at hearings since early October. He has spent most of the time since in London, where his wife is receiving treatment for cancer. He arrived in Islamabad on Thursday. 
Sharif became the 15th premier in Pakistans 70-year history to be ousted before completing a full term, after the corruption investigation against him. 
The claims against the prime minister stemmed from the Panama Papers leak last year, which sparked a media frenzy over the luxurious lifestyles and high-end London property portfolio owned by his family. 
Sharif and his supporters have denied the allegations and hinted at a political conspiracy driven by the powerful military. 
I am going to Pakistan despite (my wifes) chemotherapy to appear in a bogus case, he told media in London before departing.

IPU assures to look into grievances: JO
	
The Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU) Secretary-General had assured to look into the concerns raised by the Joint Opposition (JO) MPs over violation of rights of MPs and democratic value in Sri Lanka, MP Dullas Alahapperuma said yesterday.
A team of three JO MPs led by its National Organiser MP Alahapperuma met the Secretary-General Martin Chungong and Rogier Huizenga, Head of IPUs Human Rights Programme at IPU House in Switzerland on Thursday.
Speaking to the Daily Mirror from Geneva, the MP said they briefed the IPU officials about the arrest of JO MPs, impounding of their passports, postponement of elections for local government bodies and provincial councils, procedural irregularities in passing legislature and issues of allocating adequate time for JO MPs in Parliament.
We, the JO, are the second largest group in Parliament with 55 MPs. This is one-fourth of the members of Parliament but we have only been given 15% of speech time for a day. Today, passports of 11 MPs had been impounded, he said.
He said Secretary-General Chungong instructed IPU HR Head Huizenga to obtain details of arrests of JO MPs and assured that he would speak with Speaker Karu Jayasuriya over the matters raised by the MPs.
The group including MPs Vasudeva Nanayakkara and Gamini Lokuge is also scheduled to meet representatives of the International Labour Organization (ILO) over alleged harassment of trade union leaders and politically motivated charges levelled against personnel.
The MPs are also scheduled to take part in events organised by the Sri Lankan community in Switzerland. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

Low on numbers but high on adrenalin
	

The music festival organised by the Sri Lanka Guitar Association to mark the 100th anniversary of the Russian revolution, unfortunately, had a low turnout but ran high on adrenalin.
It may have been fear of rain that kept crowds away, as the venue was the Vihara Maha Devi Parks open-air theatre. But it turned out to be a warm, humid night, and those who braved their fears and came were treated to a scintillating mix of music and dance for more than four hours, all for free.
Multi-ethnic in nature, the opening dance sequences established a mood of colourful sobriety. Musaeus College dance teacher Thelma Mendis, her daughter Chitrina Mendis and a student gave a graceful demonstration of North Indian Kathak, in which the hands are constantly probing the space around the dancer to regular changes in tempo and rhythm. The hand movements matter more than the footwork.
This was followed by a Tamil version of Kohomba Kankakariya performed by Jeyakumar Thandeepan and Manikkam Vasintha. In contrast to kathak, the feet carry the dancers over larger spaces and while the hands perform the same probing of space, but much faster and to more forceful music.
This was followed by an example of Dr Gamini Haththotuwegamas street theatre of the 1980s, a short but intense exploration of a dark theme of that era, of extrajudicial killings and unidentified bodies left in the street.
Nishad Handunpathirana and Abishek Cooray gave a fine demonstration of a duet between the north Indian dilruba and the tabla. The dilruba is played cello-like with a horizontal bow; accompanied by the constant drone of a shruti box, the wailing dilruba and the booming tabla joined together to create the ruminating, sometimes melancholic melodies of ragadhari music in a cathartic harmony of eastern string and percussion.

Next came the Prasanna Sanjeewa band, a very youthful and talented orchestra with a full rhythm guitar section and two violin sections including a four-girl team and a blend of eastern and western percussion, as well as a delightful piano accordion, to accompany Amarasiri Peiris and other singers who gave their time and talent free of charge to sing that night.
Amarasiri Pieris entertained with two of his favourites  Malak Vunay Ai Numba Mata and Yamu Yamu Yamy Enna Yamu Premiye. This was followed by Lisa Abeyratne who sang the popular Russian folk song Katyusha with its fast-paced tempo, and a Tanzanian folk song by the great South African singer Miriam Makeba. She concluded that highly charged performance with a Sinhala song originally sung by Apsara de Silva. The orchestra ably backed the slower, more familiar rhythms of the Sinhala saragi as well as the frenzied tempo of the Russian and African folk music.
Thushara de Silva sang a solo song of Sinhala rock, a relatively new phenomenon which expands the horizons of Sinhala pop. Next, visharadha Ranjith Abeysinghe sang the late Gunadasa Kapuges Bimbarak Senaga, the songs eerie flute arpeggios and the addition of two traditional drums to the percussion creating a dramatic shift of mood.
Popular singer Jagath Wickremasinghe followed with two of his hits, including Obath Mamath Sitina Me Lova Thula. This item signalled the exit of this delightful orchestra.
Festival organizer and guitar association secretary Mohammad Iqbal, accompanied by his wife playing the flute and panflute, followed with three songs  two originals in Sinhala and one Azerbaijanian folk song. Hes a talented singer and composer of songs, and these songs provided a pleasant acoustic interlude to the evenings repertoire.

Multi-ethnic in nature, the opening dance sequences established a mood of colourful sobriety

Next came Suresh Priyadharshana who sang a solo with his guitar. What came next took the stage by storm. Sarath Fernando is a son of the late, great baila singer M. S. Fernando (its unfair to push him into the baila slot because he constantly experimented and expanded the form until some of his most memorable songs merged with the best of Sinhala sarala gi, but with a melodic character all of his own).
People know Sarath Fernando as a singer of his fathers hits, but he showed this evening that hes an accomplished exponent of Western genres such as indie rock and reggae (reggae is the Caribbean but by association with international music labels it is now world music). He set the stage ablaze with two Bob Marley songs including Get Up Stand Up, followed by Pudgalikai Rahasigathai, high-octane Sinhala original composed for a play. Then came Hada Popiyai, one of his fathers evergreen hits with those bell-like guitar riffs so evocative of the Shadows and other great 60s exponents of the electric guitar. As if this wasnt enough, he and his five-member band concluded with a rousing rendition of Carlos Santanas Jingo which blended gamely into the Gajaga Wannama and other local tunes.
Jingo is an instrumental number (with a little background vocals) where percussion (conga drums) dominate, accompanied by the electronic synthesizer. In this version, Sarath Fernando effortlessly fused electric lead guitar with percussion and in the process showed that hes a world-class guitarist. Instead of the now ubiquitous pedal, he depends on the now little used tremolo arm (or wah wah) and uses it with consummate skill to evoke 60s and 70s electric guitar sounds. What a pity that this brilliant band doesnt even have a name  when I asked the keyboardist, he smiled and said: we just had a chat and got together for today. These are musicians musicians who dont care whether the audience is 10 or 10,000 because they will play for the unbeatable adrenaline rush of playing good music.
That should have been the culminating item because whatever came after this bravura performance seemed a little flat no matter how good it was. Next came Benedict Kasthuriarachchi and the Victor Jara band from Kandy, an acoustic band with electric bass and drums, playing two original songs in Sinhala about Victor Jara and Nelson Mandela.
Rohan de Silva offered mellifluous versions of two great American folk-pop ballads  Bob Dylans Blowin In The Wind and Pete Seegers Where Have All The Flowers Gone. He was accompanied by Thushara Aluthgama playing the guitar.
Finally, there was Skitzo with their own peculiar versions of Sinhala rock and heavy metal. Its a three-member band (vocals, bass and electric lead) and their songs about existential despair has a youthful following, with people dancing and applauding.
It was an evening of excellent entertainment, marred only by fear of bad weather and unsuitability of the venue. There is a problem with the acoustics, with only high-pitched sounds coming through and what is sung or played at low pitch sounding garbled. Organisers should take note of that.

No one spoke of an alliance: UNP
	
No one spoke of forming an alliance with the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) to contest at the local Government election as Minister Rajitha Senaratne only talked about trying to figure out a common list only in Beruwala, the United National Party (UNP) said yesterday.
This sentiment was expressed by Minister Gayantha Karunathilaka and MP Ajith Mannaperuma at a media briefing held in UNP headquarters Sirikotha last morning.
Minister Senaratne only spoke about trying out a figure out a common list only in Beruwala and never spoke of a forming an alliance with the SLFP.  UNP will contest the local government election with its allies as UNF, Mr Karunatilleke said.
Meanwhile, the duo who spoke of the new Constitution said an extensive debate was held on the constitution in order to get as many proposals of political parties to the maximum.
The all-party conference will also help gather as many proposals as possible as the objective of making the Constitution compiling process a joint effort of all parties. The MPs, therefore, said the constitutional assembly debate has not been an unwanted exercise, Mr Manannpaeruma said. (Yohan Perera)

Questions I ask myself-whither do we go
	
If not rebirth, why was I born a Muslim Was it by choice, or was it or is it, I was to have this one single and profound experience which will resolve all things for me or mould me into that perfection by which all things are resolved for me




My typewriter is getting old, almost falling apart and so am I. Before things get any worse let me put some crucial thoughts down. So many hundreds have done this sort of thing before - some of the greatest, noblest beings, those who have reached the pinnacle of spirituality.
What is the purpose of our lives Have our purposes been determined for us Or have we been set down upon this earth, as a machine may have been set down, programmed to live through for a certain number of years depending on the vagaries of our environments and the potentialities set down for us Or are we part of the vast evolutionary processes described by Charles Darwin Where does God come into all this And what about the different views held by the different religions of the world  What about belief and unbelief What about miracles and what do they do to enlighten us on the way  What indeed is the meaning of all this wondrous existence of ours I despair even before I begin to ever find answers to these questions, questions which are nevertheless of utmost importance to our lives, as to how we carry on from day to day, hour to hour and perhaps second to second. I am not like the philosophers or religionists trying to find answers to universal problems, I merely wish to understand things for myself.
First, let me try and resolve this question of whether there is rebirth or not, or whether we have simply to through one lifetime, given the one single chance in life to make it or break it. If not rebirth, why was I born a Muslim Was it by choice, or was it or is it, I was to have this one single and profound experience which will resolve all things for me or mould me into that perfection by which all things are resolved for me

As a Muslim I am given to know that God knows all things and we with our puny understanding can know but little and are all but ignorant

To my way of understanding, there is nothing that can possibly explain and resolve the iniquities and inequities replete in this world of ours, the sufferings that human beings have been heir to throughout the annals of human existence, the existence of animals
And creatures lower down the evolutionary scale. Yet why such an apparently endless detour to reach the eventual happiness or goal of life we envisage.
As a Muslim I am given to know that God knows all things and we with our puny understanding can know but little and are all but ignorant . As the Sufis who have as far as we can tell reached the pinnacle of spirituality will tell us it is the final absorption in God, in the Divine through first an entry into states of bliss and into an Heaven that will be the ultimate revelation.
We are given revelations through the Prophets sent down to earth by God as guidance for humanity and finally the revelations sent down to the Prophet Muhammad setting a seal as it were upon all the earlier revelations and therefore perfecting them. Is this then the solution that has been and is available to the billions of beings both human and otherwise, the solution which offers salvation to them all 
The Sufis moreover tell us that it is Love at its loftiest heights, Love that infuses all things that surely is the grand finale to such a grandiose play which describes our sojourn on earth.
True perhaps as it would seem to many, but is it open to all and to all things and how long does it take finally - an eternity or many eternities It is known that our Earth in cosmic time is said to be 5 billion years old and human beings have been around for the past 10,000 to 15,000 years- that is a long, long time. The Hindus believe that there have been in the course of time 6 Pralyas (Extinctions) and we are nearing the end in a 7th extinction.
A contemporary Muslim theologian, Sheikh Imran Hussain who has made Islamic eschatology his specialty says that the Akirazaman ( the end of the world) as it is known to Muslims is round the corner and predicts the appearance of the personage known as Dajjal - a one-eyed being who is said to make his appearance in order to mislead humanity. He avers this may be a metaphor for the Zionist State - and also of the Second Coming of Jesus Christ as it has been predicted in the Quran. . He says that all the predictions in the Quran and the Hadis -the traditions of the Prophet Muhammad which include his sayings point to the Malhama or end of the world. I may have no doubt about all these and no doubts about much more Islamic theologians may speak about. My problem, however, is how to reconcile all this in terms of what happens to us in our personal lives, in our relationships with each other, who hold such a diversity of beliefs.
Those who have had Near Death Experiences (NDEs) , gone out of their bodies and beyond our earthly prison to a beyond and returned again to earth reluctantly speak of an inconceivably peaceful world in those other realms. This surely does not accord with the notion of an earthly sojourn which has to end, with a resurrection followed by an eternal life with a hell or heaven in-between. Or as Buddhist and Hindus believe with renewed life again on earth in forms determined by how a beings life was conducted during an earlier lifetime - a form of trial otherwise spoken of in the traditions of the monotheistic religions.
God-realisation may be one thing but how to conceive of a God can be quite puzzling. The Greeks had the conception of gods, goddesses, various powers of nature and of an all-powerful deity controlling all. The Hindu conception encompasses deities too with their multifarious functions like the Greek pantheons. Buddhism although in its original form propounded by the Buddha was purely rationalistic later acquired the trappings of the deistic Hindu religions and though it continued to rebirth as fundamental came to accept Nibbhana - annihilation or as others would have it ultimate bliss as the end of it all..
Will it ever be possible in the course of our brief lives on earth to find consensus, ever to have one religion for the entire humanity and have beliefs and experiences each according to the findings, the revelatory experiences, visions and certitudes in miracles of those belonging to different dispensations  There are many Christians who believe that Jesus Christ was crucified and died in order to absolve the sins of humanity while Muslims believe Christ was taken up to Heaven bodily. Then there is incontrovertible evidence of stigmata among Christian savants like Father Padre Pio. If one were to ask contemporary Muslim theologians like Sheikh Ismail Menk, Nouman Ali, Hamza Yusuf and others like them they would say we cannot have final answers and would have to stop when it comes to probing what they would call the Unseen. What then
Do we follow whatever dispensation we take up as the most credible, as the best that should be followed according to the experiences and beliefs which we can come closest to understanding and wait for the rest to unfold in a beyond, whatever that beyond may hold for us 
We may not know him as God; we may know him as Nature, our Higher Self, Infinity, some ineffable goal. It was so that the Buddha approached Him. He is accessible even to the Atheist. To the materialist he disguises Himself in matter. For the Nihilist he waits ambushed in the bosom of Annihilation, says Sri Aurobindo the Hindu sage.
Man is a transitional being. His is not final. He is the middle term of the evolution, not its end, crown or consummating masterpiece, he also said.
I shall end with another quote from Sri Aurobindo after which little needs said. It is as follows:
There is nothing mind can do that can be better done in the minds immobility and thought-free stillness.
When mind is still, then Truth gets a chance to be heard in the purity of the silence.
....Truth lives in the calm wordless Light of the eternal spaces; she does not intervene in the noise and cackle of logical debate.
...Cease inwardly from thought and word, be motionless within you, look upward into the light and outward into the vast cosmic consciousness that is around you. Be more and more with brightness and the vastness. Then will Truth dawn on you from above and flow in on you from all around you.

School system should change: PM
	
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe yesterday stressed the need for a new education system under which Government funded schools could play a greater role in educating children.
Mr Wickremesinghe made this proposal during a ceremony held at St Josephs College Colombo to mark the Catholic Teachers Day in the Archdiocese of Colombo last morning.
We have to help the Government funded schools further. Government is already supporting these schools but more support has to be given. I have advised the Minister of Education to have a discussion with Cardinal and with the Buddhist schools such as Musaeus College and determine how the Government could support them further.
It can be considered whether Government funded schools could be allowed to collaborate with other schools located close to them. If Government funded schools collaborate with a small school nearby it would be possible to develop both these schools. We need to think of new avenues. We need to redesign the countrys school system. It is also essential to have disciplined teachers, the Prime Minister said.
He said the first two years of the Government was spent to devise a system to administer schools.
Some schools have gained high standards with the systems provided by the Buddhist organisations, Catholic and Protestant Churches. School system is far from being sound today. Schools run by religious organisations do not provide and subject based education alone but builds up characters.
The standard of the schools system today had given rise to tuition classes and international schools. If the Government kept only a few schools under its purview and allowed others to be run by religious organisations as in the 1960s, countrys system would have been much better.
Children have to go out of the country for higher studies today but those days foreign children came here to study, he added.
The Catholic Church had done great service with regard to education throughout the world. People were educated in places of worship in the past when there was feudalistic society. In Sri Lanka education was provided in temples. In Europe this service was provided by the Church.
This was how knowledge was provided. Some religious institutions became centres of higher education. There were Pirivenas in Sri Lanka.
Some of these religious institutions which provided higher education were later converted into Universities such as Oxford and Cambridge. The Protestant Church introduced a school system.
This system came to Sri Lanka in the 19th Century. The first school was started by the Government. The Protestant Church also started schools in Sri Lanka later. During this time there was a notion that other religions too should be allowed to start schools.
Schools were then taken over giving rise to protests. The then Bishop Christopher Bonjin was instrumental in bringing in a concept of Government funded schools.
Buddhist, Catholic, Hindu and Muslim schools came into existence as a result of his efforts. Catholic Church therefore rendered a great service. There were mostly Government funded schools mostly in the 1960s.
There were Government schools as well such as Ananda and Nalanda and Visakha. The Church of England also owned schools. The Church was also involved in hospital work as well. The Government in the 1960s decided to take over private schools but allowed some schools to stay on as private ventures.
They were asked to find their funds themselves. Late President J. R. Jayewardene and Dudley Senanayake said do not take over schools at once but do it gradually.
Many schools were made Government funded schools. Buddhist organizations handed over all schools which were run by them to the Government, Catholic and Protestant schools kept some of the schools. Some Buddhist schools should have remained as private schools. There are no Buddhist schools today in Sri Lanka as a result of handing such schools over to the Government, he said.

Sri Lanka widens gender gap in wage equality
	
Sri Lanka ranked as low as 109 of 144 countries in the Global Gender Gap Report-2017 and widened its gender gap in wage equality for similar work.
According to the latest report which was released by the World Economic Forum (WEF) on Thursday, Sri Lanka scored 0.669 this year whereas it scored 0.673 last year and remained at 100 of 144 countries.
A country score of 0.000 showed imparity while a score of 1.000 meant parity. When the index was compiled in 2006 for the first time ever, Sri Lanka ranked at 13 out of 115 countries.
Sri Lanka has widened its gender gap in the sub-index of wage equality for similar work despite a modest increase in parity in estimated earned income. However, Sri Lanka is the only country in the South Asian region which has fully closed its health and survival gender gap, the report said.
With an average remaining gender gap of 34%, South Asia is the second-lowest scoring region on this years Global Gender Gap Index, ahead of the Middle East and North Africa and behind Sub-Saharan Africa.
Sri Lankas neighbours Bangladesh was ranked at 47, Maldives at 106, India at 108, Nepal at 111, Bhutan at 124 and Pakistan at 143.
Bangladesh and the Maldives are the top-ranked countries in the region while the lowest-ranked countries are Bhutan and Pakistan. Nepal is one of the top five climbers over the past decade on the overall Index. From a low base, South Asia has made the fastest progress on closing its gender gap of any world region, the index report said.
It said on average basis, low-income countries have closed 92% of their labour market participation gender gaps.
By contrast, lower-middle income countries such as Egypt, India, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Guatemala and Indonesia have closed only 67% of their labour market participation gender gaps, it said.
Nordic countries such as Iceland, Norway and Finland ranked at first, second and third places of the index followed by Rwanda, Sweden, Nicaragua, Slovenia, Ireland, New Zealand and Philippines in the top ten places respectively.
Yemen made it to the bottom of the index by being slotted in the 144th place followed by Pakistan, Syria, Chad and Iran. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

REUTERS, 3 November, 2017- People in Thailand celebrated the Loy Krathong or floating basket festival on Friday, following a year of mourning for late King Bhumibol Adulyadej that saw many celebrations muted or cancelled.
The mourning ended on Monday after a five-day funeral last week, and many citizens have returned to wearing colored garments after having stuck to black for a year.
Participants in the festival pay respects to the water spirits, floating small, traditionally-hand crafted rafts carrying flowers, bamboo and candles on waterways in an ancient ritual.

AFP, 3 November, 2017- Syrian troops on Friday retook the last major city where the Islamic State group had a presence as Iraqi forces seized a crossing by the jihadists last urban bastion across the border. 
The simultaneous assaults on Deir Ezzor in eastern Syria and Al-Qaim in western Iraq dealt fresh blows to IS in its former heartland, leaving Albu Kamal, on the Syrian side of the border, the last town of note under its full control. 
The jihadist group that once laid claim to a self-styled caliphate spanning swathes of Syria and Iraq has seen its proto-state crumble in recent months under the pressure of multiple offensives. 
In October, it lost its one-time de facto Syrian capital Raqa after an assault of more than four months waged by the US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces, a Kurdish-Arab alliance. 
On Friday, Syrias army announced that its Russian-backed assault had recaptured all of Deir Ezzor city, in the oil-rich east of the country, while Iraqi forces captured the Husaybah border post on the edge of the town of Al-Qaim.

Will The  Unseating Of Geetha  Disqualify the UPFA List of Galle MPs
	
By D.B.S.Jeyaraj
Popular Sinhala movie actress Geetha Kumarasinghe, who was elected Member of Parliament from the Galle electoral District on the United Peoples Freedom Alliance (UPFA) ticket in August 2015 has been unseated as an MP by rulings of the Sri Lankan Judiciary.
According to relevant media reports, a five-judge bench of the Sri Lankan Supreme Court had on November 2nd 2017 ruled unanimously that Galle District Parliamentarian Geetha Kumarasinghe was not qualified to be elected as a Member of Parliament since she was holding dual citizenship at the time of her election. The countrys apex court upheld a Writ of Quo Warranto issued by the Court of Appeal that the Galle District UPFA MP Geetha Kumarasinghe was not entitled to hold office as a Member of Parliament since she had contested the August 2015 election while holding dual citizenship.
The Court of Appeal on March 3rd 2017 had held that in terms of Article 91(1) (d) (xiii) of the Constitution, Geetha Kumarasinghe was not qualified to be elected as a Member of Parliament since she holds dual citizenship in Switzerland and Sri Lanka. Subsequently, MP Geetha Kumarasinghe filed an Appeal in the Supreme Court challenging the Court of Appeal judgment. On May 15 2017 , a divided three-judge-Supreme Court bench had granted special leave to appeal with the petition filed by Ms. Kumarasinghe.

Five Judge Bench Of The Supreme Court
Chief Justice Priyasath Dep appointed a five-judge bench of the Supreme court to hear the appeal. The unanimous judgment of the divisional bench of five judges, comprising Chief Justice Priyasath Dep and Justices B.P. Aluvihara, Sisira J. De Abrew, Anil Gooneratne and Nalin Perera, was read in open court by Justice De Abrew.
When I consider the Article 91(1) (d) (xiii) of the Constitution, I hold that if a candidate in a Parliament Election is a citizen of Sri Lanka and any other country on the day of Parliament election or on the day of taking oaths as a Member of Parliament (MP), he/she cannot be considered as an MP and that office of such a person as an MP is a nullity, Justice Abrew observed.
After taking oaths as a MP, if he/she becomes a citizen of any other country or continues to be a citizen of any other country, he/she too cannot be considered as an MP and that office of such a person as a Member of Parliament is nullity, Justice Abrew added

When I consider the Article 91(1) (d) (xiii) of the Constitution, I hold that if a candidate in a Parliament Election is a citizen of Sri Lanka and any other country on the day of Parliament election or on the day of taking oaths as a Member of Parliament (MP), he/she cannot be considered as an MP and that office of such a person as an MP is a nullity

The Supreme Court Judgment said Ms. Kumarasinghe was disqualified to be elected as a Member of Parliament from 17 August 2015 - the day of the election - and on 1 September 2017 when she took oaths as a Parliamentarian. Dismissing Kumarasinghes appeal, the Supreme Court bench ruled that the Court of Appeal was correct in its 3 May 2017 ruling to issue a Writ of Quo Warranto declaring that the Galle District MP was disqualified from being a Member of Parliament. The Court also directed the Registrar to send the judgment to the Secretary-General of Parliament immediately.
Kumara Vidugalage Dona Geetha Samanmalee Kumarasingha popularly known as Geetha Kumarasinghe was elected to Parliament for the first time in Aug 2015 polling 63,955 votes. Six MPs were elected on the UPFA ticket from the Galle District in the poll. Geetha was the fifth of the six UPFA Galle District MPs. Next to Geetha as the sixth MP was Mohan Priyadarshana de Silva polling 53, 071 preferences. Former Indigenous medicine and Vocational training minister Piyasena Gamage who polled 47, 247 votes and came seventh failed to get elected. The top four garnering preference votes in the 2015 August UPFA Galle District list of MPs were - Chandima Weerakkodi (114,851), Ramesh Pathirana (105,434), Nishantha Muthuhettigama (75,994) and Manusha Nanayakkara (73,387). Geethas disqualification will enable ex-minister Piyasena Gamage the next in line in terms of preferences to become an MP again.

Appeal Court Quo Warranto Writ
The Quo Warranto writ issued by the Appeal court against Geetha Kumarasinghe is a direct consequence of the 19th Constitutional Amendment. Consequent to the 19th Amendment to the Constitution of Sri Lanka, no person can be elected to Parliament if they held dual citizenship.
The 19th Amendment enacted hastily after President Maithripala Sirisena was elected to office in January 2015 re-introduced the two-term limit on the number of terms a person could hold office as President.
According to Clause 4 of the 19th Amendment and Article 31(2) of the Constitution, a person who has been twice elected as President is disqualified from contesting the third time.
Likewise the 19th Constitutional amendment also debarred persons holding office from becoming an MP or President of Sri Lanka. As per Art 92 (b) and Clause 20 (4) of the 19th Amendment, and Article 91(1)(d)(xiii) of the Constitution, persons who are dual citizens are disqualified from being elected as Members of Parliament or the President of the Republic. The Constitution stipulates - No person shall be qualified to be elected as a Member of Parliament or to sit and vote in Parliament if;(d) (xiii) a citizen of Sri Lanka who is also a citizen of any other country;
An interesting question that arose at the time of the 2015 August election was how Geetha Kumarasinghe was allowed to contest polls and/or why she was not debarred or disqualified then. It was common knowledge in 2015 that Geetha, having married a Swiss national, was a citizen of both Sri Lanka and Switzerland. Geetha who got married to Chris Fuhrer Ferdinand many years ago has a daughter, Tharika Fiona by that marriage.
When opponents raised the issue of dual citizenship at that time, Geetha herself said she had renounced her Swiss citizenship by writing to the Swiss Embassy. It was however hazy as to whether a citizen could renounce Swiss citizenship by merely writing a letter. On the other hand, it was also doubtful as to whether the election contesting taboo imposed on dual citizens by way of the 19th Constitutional amendment had legal effect or not.
The 19th Amendment to the Constitution expressly prohibited a Citizen of Sri Lanka who is also a citizen of any other country from contesting the elections. The 19th Constitutional Amendment came into effect on 15 May 2015. Nominations for the Parliamentary elections closed on 13 July 2015 . As such it was theoretically possible for Elections Department officials to have rejected nomination papers with a candidate or candidates rendered ineligible on account of holding dual citizenship. However, when the UPFA Galle District list was challenged by interested parties during the time of nomination, the Returning Officer said that he could not reject the UPFA list due to one of the candidates, Geetha Kumarasinghe, being a dual citizen.
Later on the Sunday Times posed a specific question about the exact position to the then Additional Elections Commissioner M.M. Mohamed, who also dealt with legal matters, he reportedly answered: There is no provision (in the law) where we could have rejected a nomination on the grounds that a candidate was holding dual citizenship.
We also have no powers to investigate whether a candidate had dual citizenship. Even after the elections, there is no provision to refrain from Gazetting the names of those who were elected. However, the matter could be brought up in court and it will give a ruling. Or the Secretary-General of Parliament can decide whether such a person could sit or not.

SLFP Organiser For Bentara-Elpitiya
This being the practical situation after the 19th Constitutional Amendment there was no hitch when Geetha Kumarasinghe was nominated as a UPFA candidate or when she actively campaigned in the Galle District. Geetha was the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) organiser for the Bentara-Elpitiya Electoral division. She won the electorate for the UPFA with 34,275 (52.7%) as opposed to the United National Party (UNP) getting 26, 559 (40.83%).
In terms of overall preference votes in the Galle District, it was Chandima Weerakkodi who topped the UPFA list with 114,851 votes. Geetha Kumarasinghe came fifth with 63,955 preferences. She was elected. Geethas name was duly Gazetted as the Galle District MP and she took her oaths on September 1st when the new Parliament convened. Her name was also included in the Sri Lanka Parliament directory of MPs. It appeared that she had become an MP despite the legality of her election being under scrutiny.
The post - 19th Amendment constitutional position regarding dual citizens right to contest elections was firmly established by the Court of Appeal on May 3 2017 , when it unseated Galle District MP Geetha Kumarasinghe, for failing to negate her dual citizen status by renouncing her Swiss nationality before she contested for Parliament in August 2015. Court held that under the 19th Amendment to the Constitution, a dual citizen is not eligible to contest for Parliamentary membership and therefore Ms. Kumarasinghe could no longer function as a Parliamentarian. This ruling is now upheld by the unanimous Supreme Court decision of November 2nd 2017.
Geetha Samanmalee Kumarasinghe was born on 5 July 1955 in Badulla. Her father Wijaya Kumarasinghe was from Hamburugala in Bentara. Her mother Udulawathi Siriwardena was from Kotmale. Though Geetha, the eldest, was born in Badulla, she and her seven younger siblings grew up in southern Bentara. Her father Wijaya was a journalist who worked as the Deputy Editor of the journal Sinhala Bauddaya (Sinhala Buddhist).

Sinhala Version Of Brigitte Bardot
Geethas tryst with glamorous fame came in the form of a beauty competition. The Davasa newspaper organised a beauty competition at Bentota in 1973. Over 100 dainty damsels participated but Geetha was crowned as the fairest of them all. One of the judges Ronald Fernando felt that Geetha should act in films. He was a friend of matinee idol Gamini Fonseka. He told Gamini about the Bentota beauty queen and suggested that she be given a chance to act in films. Gamini agreed to meet Geetha. Fonseka too was impressed by Geetha and arranged for a screen test at cinemas studio. Word got around in movie circles that a Sinhala version of Brigitte Bardot had been discovered at a beauty pageant in Bentota. Filmmakers flocked southwards to the Kumarasinghe household in Bentara. Even without a single film of hers being released Geetha had offers for 21 films.

Geethas tryst with glamorous fame came in the form of a beauty competition. The Davasa newspaper organised a beauty competition at Bentota in 1973. Over 100 dainty damsels participated but Geetha was crowned as the fairest of them all. One of the judges Ronald Fernando felt that Geetha should act in films.

Her first film contract was signed for K.A.W. Pereras Wasana. Though Wasana was Geethas first film, it was not fated to be her screen debut. Geetha Kumarasinghes first film to be released in theatres was Neil Rupasinghes Lassana Kella. It was released on 20 June 1975.
A few months later came Damayanthi. March 1976 saw Wasana hitting the screen. Then followed Manik Sandrasagaras Kolomba Sanniya. A star was born!
Geetha took the Sinhala film world by storm. A remarkable facet of Geethas vivacious personality was her readiness to interact closely with her male co-stars on screen. She was not prepared to play the coy maiden if and when a scene warranted close encounters of the physical kind. This was indeed a refreshing boon to directors. Film fans of all ethnicities invaded cinemas in large numbers to see this bombshell of scintillating beauty acting in sensual scenes. Movies featuring Geetha Kumarasinghe seldom bombed at thebox office.
Geetha, however, could never be stereotyped as a bimbo playing eye-candy roles alone. She began acting in weighty roles that demonstrated her acting abilities from the beginning of her film career and continued to do so over the years. Films such as Pembara Madhu, Podi malli, Siribo Ayya, Sathara Diganthaya, Karumakkarayo, Mahagedara, Anuragaye Ananthaya, Palama Yata, Rajya Sevaya Pinisai, Loku Duwa and Ran Diya Dahara testify to her acting prowess. Who can forget the characters Dulcie in Pembara Madhu, Dotty in Palama Yata, Punna in Lokuduwa and Amali in Ran Diya Dahara

Roles Of Oppressed Women FightingAgainst Odds
Acting in roles of oppressed women fighting against the overwhelming odds of life is a Geetha Kumarasinghe hallmark. She has won the National Award for Best Supporting Actress twice and National Award for Best Actress thrice. Geetha also obtained the prestigious Sarasaviya award for Best Actress four times and the Most Popular Actress award once. Geetha also got the Swarna Sanka award for Best Actress twice. In a film career spanning more than three decades Geetha has acted in over 80 films. Most of them are Sinhala movies. Yet she has also acted in non-Sinhala movies made by Indian, Pakistani, Japanese and French filmmakers.
Geetha Kumarasinghe also blossomed into a producer of popular films of great quality. Some of the films produced by her were Palama Yata, Salambak Handai, Loku Duwa, Anuragaye Ananthaya, Wasuli and Geetha. She won two Best Film awards at the Sarasaviya festival in her capacity as producer for Palama Yata and Loku Duwa. In later years Geetha also became a successful business entrepreneur, running several garment factories.
Though Geetha Kumarasinghe hailed from a middle class politically conscious family, she never engaged in active politics preferring to concentrate on her film career. Her entry to politics was due to Mahinda Rajapaksa who enlisted her services on his behalf in the 2010 presidential election campaign.
Canvassing for Mahinda at the polls was an exhilarating experience for the popular actress. Thereafter she was appointed UPFA Organiser for Bentara-Elpitiya electoral division in the Galle District. Geetha contested the 2010 elections on the UPFA ticket from Galle. She lost. In 2014 she contested the Southern Provincial Council poll and was elected as Councillor. In 2015 she entered Parliament as an MP fiercely loyal to Mahinda Rajapaksa. Despite overtures, she did not join the Maithripala Sirisena camp.
Prior to the 19th Constitutional Amendment being enacted, it was possible for people with dual citizenship to contest elections in Sri Lanka. When the Sirisena-Wickremesinghe Govt. replaced the Rajapaksa regime in January 2015 , many of the bottlenecks surrounding the obtaining of dual citizenship by Sri Lankan expatriates were removed. Despite these dual citizenship friendly actions, the new regime introduced a problematic provision in the 19th Constitutional Amendment debarring dual citizens from contesting elections in Sri Lanka. It was widely believed then that the provision was a pre-emptive move to prevent ex-President Rajapaksas sibling Gotabaya Rajapaksa from seeking electoral office.

Former Defence Secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa
Former Defence and Urban development secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa is a controversial personality who is loved by some and hated by others. There is a school of thought in Sri Lanka which is optimistic that Gotabaya Rajapaksa is destined to rule the country in the future just as his elder brother did. The 19th amendment has reversed the 18th amendment and blocked Mahinda Rajapaksa from contesting for the presidency again. If the envisaged new constitution materialises and the executive presidency is abolished and the Prime ministerial office is empowered then Mahinda Rajapaksa can or may seek Prime ministerial office.
If however, the diluted executive presidency continues to remain then an alternative to Mahinda has to be found. Many think the alternative is Gothabaya. In recent times the Gotabaya fan club has been working overtime promoting the retired Army Colonel as the prospective presidential candidate. This push may have suffered a temporary setback due to the ruling on Geetha Kumarasinghes election.
As of now Gotabaya Rajapaksa is a dual citizen holding US citizenship. His only son is well-settled in the US. If Gota is to contest the presidential or Parliamentary poll in the future he would have to give up his US citizenship. In spite of critically denouncing the US at times, Gotabaya has not shown any inclination to renounce his US citizenship. Some months ago when Gota addressed the Foreign Correspondents Association in Colombo the ex-Defence secretary was non - committal about renouncing US citizenship and entering active politics. Mahinda too has not been too enthusiastic about Gota contesting polls.
In any case, the Appeal court ruling upheld by the Supreme Court on Geetha Kumarasinghe has demonstrated that if Gotabaya Rajapaksa wants to be elected to high office then he has to clearly and unequivocally renounce US citizenship. Those in the Sirisena - Wickremesinghe - Kumaratunga camp opine that Gota would never give up his US citizenship. Hence the provision in the 19th amendment was an anticipatory stratagem aimed at keeping Gota out of Parliament and the Presidents House. It was based on the premise that Gotabaya would never opt to lose his dual citizenship status. It remains to be seen whether this calculation is correct or not.

Fate Of UPFA Candidate List For Galle District
Another issue that arises out of Geetha Kumarasinghes disqualification is the fate of the other candidates from the UPFA elected to Parliament. When the court of appeal ruled earlier that she was disqualified there was much speculation that the entire UPFA list of candidates for the Galle District was also disqualified. There were many media reports to that effect. Several politicians from Galle also announced to the media that they would mount legal challenges against the validity of MPs elected on the UPFA list. If the election was indeed null and void on account of Geetha Kumarasinghes ineligibility to be an MP then all six elected from the UPFA could forfeit their seats was the calculation. Ms. Kumarasinghes appeal to the Supreme court against the Appeal court ruling brought about a temporary lull to those speculative calculations or
calculative speculations.

Gamini agreed to meet Geetha. Fonseka too was impressed by Geetha and arranged for a screen test at cinemas studio. Word got around in movie circles that a Sinhala version of Brigitte Bardot had been discovered at a beauty pageant in Bentota. Filmmakers flocked southwards to the Kumarasinghe household in Bentara

Now that the Supreme Court has upheld the Appeal court ruling that unseated Geetha Kumarasinghe the question of whether the entire list of UPFA candidates for Galle District is disqualified will once again emerge. Some politicians or public interest litigants may even test this out by resorting to legal action. How and what the courts would determine on the issue if and when raised before appropriate tribunals is a matter of conjecture. There is, however, some expert opinion available on the question which may shed some light on the judicial implications of the issue.

Lawyer/Researcher Gehan Gunatilleke
Attorney -At- Law Gehan Gunatilleke is a Research Director at Verit Research. He compiled a brief note after the appeal court ruling on Geetha Kumarasinghes election. The brief was prepared with the advice and support of Dr. Nishan de Mel, Viran Corea, Sabrina Esufally, Shamara Wettimuny and Rehana Mohammed. This brief is of great relevance in the context of the Supreme Court upholding the earlier Appeal court Quo Warranto Writ. I am therefore taking the liberty of quoting extensively from that note with due acknowledgement in a bid to keep the readers informed of the position.
The briefing note by Gehan Gunatilleke is presented in three sections. The first section explains the legal recourse available in the event that a disqualified person is elected to Parliament. The second explains the provisions of the PEA with respect to the grounds on which a nomination paper can be rejected. The third section explains why the disqualification of a candidate cannot result in the invalidation of the nomination paper in which he or she was nominated. It must be noted that this paper was prepared in the aftermath of the Appeal court ruling. It is however perfectly valid in the context of the current Supreme court judgement too.

1st Section - Disqualificationof Candidates
Article 91 of the Constitution sets out the grounds on which a person may be disqualified from being elected to Parliament. For example, article 91(d) (xiii) provides that a citizen of Sri Lanka who is also a citizen of any other country is disqualified from being elected to Parliament.
This particular disqualification was introduced through the 19th Amendment to the Constitution. Meanwhile, section 14 of the Parliamentary Elections Act(PEA( reiterates these grounds by referring to the provisions of the Constitution.
Section 92(2)(d) of the PEA provides for a remedy where a candidate who is disqualified from being elected to Parliament is in fact elected. It states that an election petition may be filed against a candidate where he or she is disqualified at the time of the election. Section 93 provides that such a petition may be filed against a candidate in the Court of Appeal in terms of article 144 of the Constitution.
The Court may then invalidate the election of the candidate. Section 95 stipulates that only the following persons may file such a petition: (a) a person claiming to have had a right to be returned or elected at such election; or (b) a person alleging himself to have been a candidate at such election. Meanwhile, section 108 of the PEA stipulates the time period within which an election petition should be filed.
Under ordinary circumstances, an election petition must be presented within twenty-one days of the date of publication of the result of the election in the Gazette. Apart from election petitions, any citizen could potentially file a writ application challenging the election of a disqualified candidate.
The Court of Appeal in the Kumarasinghe case held that such a right exists under article 140 of the Constitution. It also held that Kumarasinghe was disqualified from being elected to Parliament due to her dual citizenship, which is a disqualification under article 91(1)(d)(xiii) of the Constitution.
The judgement, however, does not deal with the validity of the nomination paper of the United Peoples Freedom Alliance (UPFA) for the Galle District  the nomination paper that included Kumarasinghe as a candidate. In fact, the petitioners did not challenge the ROs decision to accept the nomination paper, nor did they name any officer of the Election Commission as a respondent in the case

2nd Section - Grounds for Rejecting Nomination Papers
Section 19(1) of the PEA lists five grounds upon which an RO can reject a nomination paper:
(a) Where the nomination paper has not been delivered to the RO during normal office hours within the nomination period by the secretary of the party, or by the candidate whose name appears first in the nomination paper, or by the candidate whose name appears second in the nomination paper;
(b) Where the nomination paper does not contain the minimum number of candidates required to be nominated in terms of article 99(3) of the Sri Lankan Constitution;
(c) Where the deposit required under section 16 of the PEA has not been made;
(d) Where the consent of one or more candidates nominated, or the oath or affirmation in the form set out in the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution, of one or more candidates, has not been endorsed on the nomination paper; or
(e) Where the signature of the secretary in the case of a recognised political party, or of the group leader in the case of an independent group, does not appear on the nomination paper, or where such signature has not been attested by a Justice of the Peace or by a notary public.
Section 19(1) of the PEA does not list a candidates disqualification as one of the grounds for invalidating a nomination paper. The question then arises as to whether the list of grounds contained in section 19 is exhaustive.
In interpreting section 19, the legal maxim expressio unius est exclusio alterius, meaning the inclusion of one thing is the exclusion of the other, becomes relevant.
According to this maxim, it may be inferred that Parliament, by including a list of specific grounds on which a nomination paper must be rejected, intended to exclude any other ground. An RO is therefore not authorised under the PEA to reject a nomination paper on the grounds that a particular candidate nominated in the nomination paper is disqualified.

3rd Section - The Validity of Nomination Papers
Under the PEA, each nomination paper is required to contain endorsements by each nominated candidate certifying that he or she is not subject to any disqualification for election. Thus each candidate certifies his or her eligibility for election to Parliament. It is noted that section 19(1A) provides:
Objections to a nomination paper may be made to the returning officer between twelve noon and one-thirty oclock in the afternoon of the last day of the period of nomination, and no such objection shall be entertained by the returning officer after one thirty oclock in the afternoon of that day.
The scope of these objections cannot include the disqualification of candidates, as the grounds for rejecting nomination papers under section 19(1) do not include the disqualification of candidates.
Moreover, the existence of a disqualification of a candidate is a factual matter, and any claim that a candidate is disqualified would require a factual inquiry. The PEA does not authorise the RO to investigate the qualifications of any nominated candidate. The ROs role is merely to ensure that the nomination paper meets the requirements set out in section 19(1) of the PEA. Thus the RO can only entertain objections relating to non-compliance with section 19(1) of the PEA, which makes no reference to the qualifications of candidates. In any event, at a practical level, the Election Commission cannot be expected to conduct inquiries into each candidates qualifications before accepting nomination papers. The sheer number of candidates nominated for Parliamentary elections (6,151 for the 2015 Parliamentary elections according to some reports) makes this task virtually impossible to carry out. For these reasons, it is appropriate that the onus be placed on each candidate to certify his or her eligibility.
In the event that some disqualification is alleged, the appropriate remedy would be an election petition filed in terms of section 92 of the PEA, or potentially a writ application. The Court of Appeal can then conduct a proper factual inquiry to determine whether any disqualification existed at the time of the election.
Section 115 of the PEA removes any doubt as to whether the disqualification of a candidate invalidates a nomination paper.
This section explicitly states that a disqualification of a candidate does not result in the invalidation of a nomination paper: The death, or withdrawal, or disqualification under any written law for election or for sitting and voting as a Member, whether before or after the election of the Member, of any person or persons nominated by a recognized political party or independent group for election at that election shall not invalidate or in any way affect the nomination paper of that party or group, and accordingly the candidature or election of any other person nominated by the party or group on that nomination paper shall not be invalidated by reason only of the fact of the death, withdrawal or disqualification of such person or persons (emphasis added).
The term written law includes the Sri Lankan Constitution, and therefore, section 115 includes the disqualifications contained in article 91 of the Constitution. Accordingly, the disqualification of a candidate following a proper inquiry does not result in the invalidation of the entire nomination paper; only the grounds specifically included in section 19(1) of the PEA can result in such invalidation.
It is also worth noting that (a) the rejection of nomination papers pre-election, and (b) the removal by the disqualification of a specific candidate post-election take place at two different stages.
These stages affect the franchise differently. On the one hand, the rejection of nomination papers takes place before the people are afforded an opportunity to elect a candidate.
Hence it takes place before the people exercise their right to vote. On the other hand, once a candidate is elected, he or she ceases to be merely part of a list contained in a nomination paper; he or she is an elected representative of the people. Accordingly, to penalise persons (otherwise qualified) after they have been elected to Parliament, on the sole basis of another candidates disqualification, could negate the peoples franchise rights and sovereignty.
This briefing note has discussed the law on (a) the grounds on which a candidate is disqualified to be elected to Parliament, and (b) the grounds on which nomination papers can be rejected. It is clear that a nomination paper cannot be rejected on the basis that a nominated candidate is disqualified.
Accordingly, the disqualification of Geetha Kumarasinghe  should it be upheld by the Supreme Court  cannot result in the invalidation of the UPFA nomination paper for the Galle district.
The nomination paper remains valid as per the PEA, and accordingly, all other candidates named in the nomination paper (provided they are qualified) retain their seats in Parliament.

Much Water Flown Down The Bentara Ganga
This then is the legal position of the Galle District UPFA Parliamentarians consequent to the Appeal Court ruling on Geetha Kumarasinghes election as summed up by Lawyer-researcher Gehan Gunatilleka. Much water has flown down the Bentara Ganga since then. The legality of the situation, however, remains the same as the Supreme court has upheld the Appeal Court ruling. Even though Geetha Kumarasinghe is disqualified as an MP, her unseating is unlikely to affect the other MPs elected from Galle District on the UPFA ticket.
