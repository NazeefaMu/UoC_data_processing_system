Bitter builder trashed a familys home with a Chainsaw
	

(Daily Mail, Australia), 1 June 2017 - A Melbourne builder has avoided jail but had to pay $80,000 to a couple, after he used a chainsaw and sledgehammer to destroy the building site he was working on. 
Kitchener Crespin, also known as Kitch destroyed the partially-built home in Glen Iris after the couple sought legal advice over his demands for extra money, reported Nine News. 
The couple had a $250,000 contract with Crespin and had already paid him an extra $100,000 when he reportedly asked them for more money.They refused and told him they were getting some legal advice. 
Less than two weeks later CCTV footage caught Crespin using yellow spray paint to write Site closed until owner pays on an exterior wall of the partially-built home.He then went on a six-day rampage, filmed dragging a chainsaw in and out of the construction site, before a neighbour called the police.

CM to western province teachers: Don't seek transfers closer to your homes
	
Western Province Chief Minister Isura Devapriya yesterday warned teachers in the western province not to request him for appointments to schools that are closest to their homes.
Addressing an event to mark the handing over of 306 teaching appointments to western province degree holders, he said though they received the appointments they really didnt have an interest to work where vacancies truly exist.
He said teachers were meeting him with letters recommended by ministers to amend their appointment areas somewhere closer to their homes.
He questioned the purpose of receiving a government employment if the degree holders cannot work where vacancies exist. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

Electricity free-of-charge to flood and landslide victims
	
Power and Renewable Energy Minister Ranjith Siyambalapitiya has instructed the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) to supply electricity free of charge for six months to consumers in flood and landslide-affected areas.
This facility will also be extended to flood and landslide victims who have been provided temporary shelters.
The minister told the media that an initial survey conducted by the CEB has found that 177,775 consumers were without power as of Thursday. In certain areas the power supply was disconnected to prevent further damage to power equipment while in some of the other areas those affected were asked to knock off the power supply to their flooded houses to prevent any possible short-circuiting due to the leakage of water. Some 28.4% of the consumers were were without power.
However, the CEB engineers and technical crew are ready to reach areas where power is not available soon as they get an opportunity to do so, the minister said.
He told journalists that a Rapid Power Restoration Unit headed by an electrical engineer has been deployed at all substations round the clock in all flood and landslide-affected districts to restore the power supply as early as possible.
The minister said a large number of CEB offices and substations went under several feet of water with those in Galle and Matara being the most affected. In the Southern Province some 253,130 power connections had been discontinued by Thursday.
He said his ministry had taken a decision to do away with the issuance of permits for mini hydro projects unless forest cover was included in the project plan.
Affected consumers can contact the CEB on, 011 3030303. (Sandun A Jayasekera)

From the  depths of the  hearts of prisoners
	

3,000 parcels of inmates and 3,000 packets from the officers were distributed with the utmost collaboration of the Air Force,
	Inmates had prepared the meal and arranged the items in a hygienic manner...

We cant help everyone, but everyone can help someone. Ronald Reagan once said. A rare act of generosity was initiated by the inmates of the Welikada Prison along with the co-ordination of Chandana Ekanayaka, the Superintendent of the Prison to voluntarily sacrifice their lunch in aid of the victims of the recent floods and earth slips.
The good work was highly commended by many owing to the fact that, this sort of approach depicted the true disposition of the people, who are often branded as criminals. It is in fact amazing how these inmates made up their mind to forgo their lunch to distribute amongst the destitute.
It was reported that 3,000 parcels of inmates and another 3,000 packets from the officers were successfully distributed with the utmost collaboration of the Air Force, who came to the front to reach the locations to give out the lunch packets to the affected ones.
We live in isolation and feel that we are forsaken. I dont intend that I deserve any concern. But when we got to know that some people of different regions are in dire need of help following the catastrophe, we as prisoners determined to do something as a compensation of what wrong we have done to some people, an inmate said.
Chandana Ekanayake, the Superintendent of the Welikada Prison told the Daily Mirror that he was extremely delighted to hear that the inmates had decided to sacrifice their lunch for flood victims. He nevertheless pointed out how the inmates concerned with the issue and enthusiastic to assist them with a possible way they could. Moreover, it was the inmates who had prepared the meal and arranged the items in a hygienic manner. I have been in this prison for 30 years and I firmly believe that these inmates possess a lot of human qualities in them. I deem that our attempt to rehabilitate them has been worthwhile, when these types of acts are visible, Ekanayake said.
It is obvious that the bureaucrats of the prison render a tremendous job towards the socialisation of the inmates in terms of the rehabilitation process and other social activities.
Indeed, it is a hard task to direct the inmates as they are susceptible to be self-willed and self-reproachful. It was reported that there are nearly 3000 prisoners comprising the inmates who have been sentenced to death and those who are appealing and those who are convicted with minor offences. I lost my temper on one occasion in my life. But it doesnt mean that I have lost my humanity. Many people label us as murderers, robbers. They may not know how we are trying to make up ourselves with sincere repentance. It is entirely a different life style we spend here from the life we had outside. I specially try to engage myself in a religious atmosphere like listening to Buddhist sermons and self meditation, another inmate said.
In conclusion, it should be noted that I dont want to exaggerate what the inmates have said to us in a brief discussion with them.
It is all that emerged from the bottom of their hearts. Besides, I have the feeling that everyone needs time to correct their mistakes, yet the support of others becomes a requisite to guide him. That is where the role of the officials came into play in this contest to motivate the inmates in carrying out their good work.
I think that it is noteworthy that the support of the officials should be praised due to the fact that this action could have not been in effect unless they showed their interest in this case.

GMOA opposes appointment of Dr. Kahandaliyanage
	
The Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) yesterday condemned the appointment of Dr. Athula Kahandaliyanage to head the Health Ministry's Disaster Management Centre.
It said the appointment was a violation of the World Health Organization (WHO) rules and the regulations.
In a letter to President Maithripala Sirisena, the GMOA accused Dr. Kahandaliyanage of having direct contacts with multinational dairy companies and on that basis he was disqualified from participating in any Health Ministry work.
GMOA President Anuruddha Padeniya said the appointment tarnished the Health Ministrys image which was nurtured by the President when he was Health Minister.
He said based on scientific evidence the WHO had put a stop to multinational dairy companies being involved in disaster management because these companies were known to use such situations to promote themselves.
Dr. Padeniya requested the President to rescind the Health Ministry decision immediately. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

I will protect right of objective criticism: Mangala
	
Finance and Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera called on the private media to expose corruption and shortcomings, if any with sufficient evidence and he would protect the right of everybody for fair criticism.
Addressing the staff of the Government Information Department for the first time after he assumed duties as the new Media Minister, Mr. Samaraweera stated that Private media always highlighted the Opposition views apparently due to their ignorance about the truth.
He said the Government Information Department should be the centre of the government in future promoting democracy, reconciliation and development. "Politics is immaterial in this exercise as political colours and parties are not relevant in the course of democracy, reconciliation and development" he added.
Samaraweera observed that when it comes to democracy, it was not a right limited only to those voted for the ruling party. Also reconciliation signifies all communities, Sinhalese, Tamils, Muslims, Malays and Burghers marching forwards with a sense of Sri Lankan identity, the minister stated.
He argued that not only those who voted for the swan, elephant and the hand symbols but also those who try to scuttle the government programmes through demonstrations with abusive slogans would also benefit when Sri Lanka becomes the economic hub of the Indian Ocean.
The Minister opined that the country cannot march forward as a nation divided as Sinhalese, Tamils and Muslims. He called on the fellow countrymen to accept the diversity in the society while maintaining the Sri Lankan identity of every individual.
"We cannot allow extremists to push the country into another war or terrorism again. We can see some people trying to spread extremism in the south and the northern counterparts are waiting to exploit that situation. Some people are trying to ignite a Sinhalese- Muslim riot in the country. Those who are frustrated because of their failure to come to power again want to fulfil their aspirations even through a bloodbath," Samaraweera charged. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

Philippine friendly fire airstrikes kill 11 troops
	

AFP MARAWI, Philippines, June1, 2017 - Philippine airstrikes aimed at Islamist militants who are holding hostages as human shields killed 11 soldiers, authorities said Thursday, as they conceded hundreds of gunmen may have escaped a blockade. 
Thirty-two soldiers and police officers have been confirmed killed.

The clashes erupted when security forces raided a house to arrest Isnilon Hapilon, a veteran Filipino militant regarded as ISs leader in the Philippines. 
Authorities said they were taken by surprise when many gunmen emerged to protect Hapilon and then went on a rampage through Marawi, which has a population of 200,000. 
Shortly after the violence erupted President Rodrigo Duterte imposed martial law across the southern region of Mindanao, home to 20 million people, to quell what he said was an IS bid to establish a base in the mainly Catholic Philippines. Local authorities have repeatedly warned that the trapped residents and hostages are in grave danger of being killed in the air assaults, and repeated calls for them to end.

Saudi returnee rejects SLFEB allegations
	
The Sri Lankan housemaid, who claimed that she was held in captive in Saudi Arabia allegedly by her employer and brought back to Sri Lanka yesterday rejected claims by the Sri Lanka Bureau of Foreign Employment (SLBFE) that she had made a false complaint.
"The house owner was holding me captive for more than two months after my service contract had expired in March 2017. The employer had forced me to donate a kidney to his wife who is suffering from a kidney ailment," W.W. Indarakanthi (36), a mother of three children and a resident of Kandalama in Dambulla said.
Much publicity was given by FEB officers that this woman had made a bogus claim and that she had been pardoned by the Saudi police on her making an appeal. However, speaking to Daily Mirror she said no such appeal was made to the Saudi Police, "nothing of that sort had taken place and that a woman in the house she worked for in Saudi had demanded one of my kidneys and the statement I made at the time to the media was true." She said her employer's son had told the Saudi police that he was not a son but a brother of the householder.
The housemaid said a lady officer of the Sri Lankan Embassy in Saudi had requested her to write a letter saying that the house owner had never demanding her kidney, and that she did not intend making a false claim.Several attempts to contact the Saudi Ambassador were unsuccessful and our attempts to contact Sanika Illangakoon the Sri Lankan representative in Saudi who had allegedly obtained the letter from the woman was also futile.

Trump announces US withdrawal from Paris climate deal
	

By Philip Rucker, Jenna Johnson 
President Donald Trump announced Thursday afternoon that he is withdrawing the United States from the landmark Paris climate agreement, a move to honor a campaign pledge that dismayed Americas allies and thwarted the global effort to address the warming planet. 
Trumps decision alarmed leaders around the world, drawing swift and sharp condemnation from foreign officials as well as top U.S. environmentalists and corporate titans, who decried the U.S. exit from the Paris accord as an irresponsible abdication of American leadership. 
But Trump cast his decision as a reassertion of Americas sovereignty, arguing that the climate pact as negotiated under President Barack Obama was grossly unfair to the U.S. workers he had vowed to protect with his populist America First campaign platform. 
The United States now joins only two countries - Nicaragua and Syria - in opposing a climate agreement reached by all other nations in 2015. A signature diplomatic achievement for President Obama, the Paris accord was celebrated at the time as a universal response to the global warming crisis.

US contributes Rs.350 Mn for SL flood relief
	
US Ambassador to Sri Lanka Atul Keshap joined President Maithripala Sirisena to announce approximately Rs. 350 million ($2.3 million) in humanitarian assistance from the United States government and people to help victims of flooding and landslides in Sri Lanka, the US embassy in Colombo announced.
It said that the aid will be used to provide safe drinking water, hygiene kits, emergency shelter materials, home repair kits, and critical health care services to stave off diseases. A portion of the assistance will be provided through Sarvodaya, a Sri Lankan nongovernmental and charitable organization.
Americans and Sri Lankans have shared a deep bond throughout the history of our two countries, the people of both countries have always stood side-by-side in times of need, said Ambassador Keshap.
The assistance will be provided through the U.S. Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA), part of the United States Agency for International Development (USAID). Since 2001, OFDA has provided approximately LKR 19 billion ($125 million) in disaster assistance and disaster risk reduction to Sri Lanka.
In addition to the relief supplies, disaster experts from USAID/OFDA and the Department of Defenses Civil Military Support Element (CMSE) attached to the U.S Embassy are helping organize U.S. response efforts, conducting damage assessments, and working with Sri Lankan government officials and humanitarian partners to evaluate needs on the ground. U.S. Army engineers and Reserve Officer Training Corps (ROTC) cadets are cleaning and repairing flood damage at schools in the Kalutara district in coordination with CMSE, the Disaster Management Centre, and local officials. Families of the U.S. Embassy community have also provided personal donations to Sri Lanka Unites, a youth-led organization.
The United States also continues to support long-term projects to reduce the risks of future disasters. USAID has provided disaster-resilient water systems to ensure safe drinking water, developed flash flood warning systems, and worked with government and local communities to strengthen disaster response and management capacity. In addition, since 2011 the U.S. Embassy has provided over LKR 2.3 billion ($15 million) to construct new facilities in schools and health care centers that serve as temporary shelter for those displaced by natural disasters.
The U.S. Embassy is monitoring the situation and continues to work closely with Sri Lankan government disaster relief authorities to identify further needs, the statement added.

Water levels at reservoirs still low: CEB
	
Despite the heavy rains in several parts of the country, the water levels in the six main hydro-power reservoirs has increased only by about 15 per cent because the catchment areas had not received sufficient rains, the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) said yesterday.
CEB Director (Development) Sulakshana Jayawardena said the water levels in the six reservoirs of Castlereagh, Mousakelle, Samanalawewa, Victoria, Randenigala and Kotmale had increased to 42.4 per cent from the 27.3 per cent before the onset of the recent rains.
Laxapana, Canyon, Norton, Kukuleganga and Upper Kotmale reservoirs had received some rains but they do not have the capacity to store water because they are run-of-river type hydroelectric generation plants, he said.
Mr. Jayawardena said about 25 to 30 per cent of the demand amounting to some 38 gigawatts was generated by hydro power plants while five per cent from wind power and the rest from thermal power plants.
He said the demand for power had comparatively decreased these days and added that the average demand stood at 40 gigawatt hours a day from the 43 during the hot-weather season.
The water levels at the six main reservoirs was as follows -- Castlereagh 61.0%, Mausakelle 55.9%, Samanalawewa 35.7%, Victoria 31.9%, Randenigala 26.1% and Kotmale 59.2%. (Ajith Siriwardana)
