All you need to know about Hepatitis
	
?
Hepatitis in general is an inflammation of the liver which can either be self-limiting or proceeds to fibrosis or scarring, liver cirrhosis or malignancy.??
As far as the etiology is concerned, Hepatitis viruses are known to be the commonest causes of hepatitis. But certain other primary infections, alcohol, medication and autoimmune diseases can contribute to the condition.??
There are 5 main types of hepatitis viruses, identified as A, B, C, D and E. These viruses have a significant potential of leading to outbreaks and spreading an epidemic. In fact, types B and C have a high risk of causing the chronic type of this liver disease, which is the commonest cause, so far identified with the development of liver cirrhosis and cancer, later in life.??
Even though all these viruses can give rise to Hepatitis in general, each condition caused by each type of virus will differ in the aspects of pathology, clinical features and treatment. Through this article we are going to discuss them separately, focusing more on A, B, C and D types of hepatitis and how they can be distinguished from one another, mainly for the purposes of diagnosis and treatment.??
Hepatitis A
Hepatitis A viral infection is transmitted from one person to another, faeco-orally, which is by consuming food and water contaminated with faeces containing this particular virus (HAV). Moreover, certain unprotected sexual practices are also known to increase the spread HAV in general.? ?A higher incidence can be seen in developing countries mainly with poor hygiene and sanitation measures. However, the World Health Organization has taken many measures in order to reduce this rate of affected individuals, by introducing various protocols and vaccines, efficacious mainly in controlling the transmission of the virus.??
The incubation period of hepatitis A is around 2?4 weeks.??
Patients will present with fever, malaise, loss of appetite, loose stools, nausea, abdominal discomfort, dark-colour urine and jaundice.??
Infections caused this way are usually mild to moderate in severity, where most affected individuals will reach a full recovery and acquire a lifelong immunity for further HAV infections. Rarely, HAV infections can become severe, particularly in patients who are immune-compromised and result in a life threatening condition.? ?It?s important to know that infections caused by hepatitis A aren?t easy to be distinguished clinically from other types of acute viral hepatitis. However, an accurate diagnosis is usually made by doing an antibody test which will show HAV-specific Immunoglobulin G (IgM) antibodies in the blood.??
Furthermore, a reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) can be used to detect the hepatitis A virus RNA, but it requires advanced laboratory techniques.? ?While there is no specific treatment for hepatitis A, the infection will gradually resolve on its own. Patients should be supplied with fluids to prevent episodes of dehydration.? ?People should be made aware of safe water supply, food safety, improved sanitation and proper hand washing techniques in order to prevent themselves from this infection.??
?
Hepatitis B
Caused by Hepatitis B virus which is mainly transmitted through infected blood, blood products, semen, body fluids, from infected mothers to infants at the time of birth or from an infected family member to an infant during the early childhood. Invasive medical procedures and blood transfusions are the main routes of introducing infected blood and body fluids to individuals at risk.??
Most affected individuals wont show any symptoms during the acute infection, whereas some may be present with signs of Jaundice, dark urine, lethargy, fatigue, nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain.??
A rare entity of patients with acute hepatitis might end up with acute liver failure or death if proper treatments aren?t administered on time.??
In the case of some people, the hepatitis B virus can also lead to a chronic liver infection that can later develop into cirrhosis of the liver or liver cancer.??
Even though there are no specific treatments for acute hepatitis B, a proper management should be carried out to provide an adequate nutritional balance and fluid replacement. Oral antiviral drugs can be used regarding patients with chronic hepatitis B infection which could reduce the progression of cirrhosis, incidence of liver cancer and improve the quality of life.? Vaccines against Hepatitis B virus are currently available to prevent related infections.??
?
Hepatitis C
This virus is usually transmitted through the exposure to blood and blood products contaminated with Hepatitis C virus. Similar to Hepatitis B virus, this can take place by blood and blood products transfusions, contaminated injections during invasive medical procedures rarely through unprotected sexual intercourse. A higher risk can be present in intravenous drug users and so far there hasn?t been any vaccine introduced against HCV.??
Patients usually present with fever, fatigue, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, joint pain and signs of jaundice.? ?Screening for anti-HCV antibodies with a serological test is helpful in identifying patients who have been infected previously with this infection where as a chronic infection could only be diagnosed by a nucleic acid test for HCV ribonucleic acid (RNA).??
Antiviral medicines are used in most affected patients which is known to be effective in 90% of persons with hepatitis C infection.??
?
Hepatitis D?
The most special feature of this infection is, it only occurs in patients who have already been infected by Hepatitis B Virus, which is known as Super infection. In fact, this combined dual infection of HDV and HBV can give rise to a more serious disease with a high rate of morbidity.? ?Even though, no effective antiviral treatment has been introduced to treat hepatitis D, so far (except for Pegylated interferon alpha which is not widely been used), a Hepatitis B vaccine is available with a protection against Hepatitis D virus.??
?
How to differentiate these 4 types?
Spread of the disease- Hepatitis A virus characteristically spreads through the ingestion of contaminated food and water whereas Hepatitis B, C and D usually take place due to parenteral contact with contaminated body fluids like blood (blood and blood product transfusions, invasive medical procedures). Furthermore, Hepatitis B can get transmitted from an infected mother to baby at birth due to possible mixing of blood and also by unprotected sexual intercourse.??
Natural history- Hepatitis A virus usually results in an acute inflammation of the liver (hepatitis) which will resolve on its own whereas Hepatitis B virus (HBV) can either be acute (short-term illness) or chronic (ongoing illness) and Hepatitis C virus (HCV) only has a chronic natural history. Hepatitis D will usually infect people, who have already got infected by Hepatitis B virus-Super infection.??
Signs and symptoms- So, as far as the signs and symptoms are considered, acute hepatitis will give rise to jaundice, fever, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain and fatigue where chronic hepatitis will present asymptomatic until it leads to cirrhosis of the liver, fibrosed and less functional after several years, which may be too late.??
Complications- Hepatitis A infection rarely results in chronic liver diseases compared to hepatitis B and C and unfortunately ends up in debilitating symptoms and fulminant hepatitis or acute liver failure) which are often life threatening.??

Australia Deputy PM Barnaby Joyce loses seat over citizenship
	
Australia's Deputy Prime Minister Barnaby Joyce has been removed from parliament for being a New Zealander, putting the government's majority at risk.
Joyce was one of five lawmakers ruled ineligible Friday by the High Court in Canberra, but the only one from the lower house.
The Australian constitution bars citizens of foreign countries from serving in parliament. Joyce claimed he wasn't aware he held New Zealand citizenship and has since renounced it.
Joyce's removal sparks a by-election, to be held on December 2, endangering Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull's one-seat parliamentary majority and putting it at risk of an opposition-led vote of no confidence, which could spark a general election.
"It's a pretty simple story, we're off to a by-election (and) I put myself forward to the people of New England as a candidate," Joyce told reporters in his constituency, a rural part of eastern Australia, and north of Sydney.
"I had no reason to believe I was a citizen of any other country but Australia."
Speaking Friday, Turnbull said it was "clearly not the outcome we were hoping for" but denied that his government faces any instability in the absence of Joyce.
"We have the support of a majority of members," Turnbull said. A no-confidence vote would require all independent and crossbench lawmakers to turn against the government.

Ban meat consumption and killing of animals
	
Four Buddhist and animal rights organizations called for a ban on meat consumption in Sri Lanka on Mondays and urged all Buddhists in the country to refrain from eating animal products during the month of May when Vesak is celebrated.
The heads of these organizations -Anagarika Dharamapala Humanitarian Foundation, Dharma Voices for Animals (DVA) , Bodhi Raja Foundation and Youth Non-vilolent Movement- told a news conference that they requested all people of Sri Lanka to refrain from eating meat on Mondays and all Buddhists to become vegetarians during the month of May as a first step towards converting Sri Lanka into a non meat-eating society.
Senior member of the Anagarika Dharamapala Humanitarian Foundation Dr Lanka Jayasuriya Dissanayake said the objective of the organizations that have come together was create a meatless society. ?As a first step towards creating a meatless society, we would like to call all Sri Lankans to refrain from eating meat on Mondays and all Buddhists to become vegetarians during the month of Vesak. Ms. Dissanayake, the daughter of Speaker Karu Jayasuriya and the spouse of Minister Navin Dissanayake, said the organizations would also campaign to educate people to prepare a healthy meals for alms . She made this request by revealing that research had confirmed that 75 percent of local Buddhist monks suffered from diabetics.
DVA Board Member Venerable Peradeniye Sathindriya Thera said the number of cattle heads slaughtered in Sri Lanka had been reduced to 170,000 in 2016 compared to 200,000 in 2013. However he said the cattle slaughter was high in the East particularly in Batticaloa and Ampara Districts. He said WHO had affirmed that meat consumption had been a major cause of cancer and other noncommunicable diseases later.
Venerable Ahangama Ananda Thera said the petition signed by nearly one million people during the 2600th Buddha Jayanthi calling for the ban on cattle slaughter had not been implemented. He said the organizations would fight for it in the future. ?Catholic, Christian and Islamic priests who saw the video clips we showed to the public during the Buddha Jayanthi were convinced and they signed the petition together with us,? he said.
Dr Damayanthi Perera a professional Dietician said the research in which she too has been involved had revealed that the conclusion that meat consumption had been the number one cause of cancer. Also she said the notion that milk is essential for the growth of humans right throughout had been proven wrong as well. Besides she said it is ironic that human beings are dependent on other animals for milk. Dr Perera said research had also confirmed that animal parts such as eyes of cattle are being used for various meat products such as sausages. ?It is also important to prevent animal farming business that would come to Sri Lanka in the form of foreign direct investments,? she added.

Bogeys cartels put out
	
The Sri Lanka Medical Association (SLMA), the national medical association in Sri Lanka, has written to the Finance Minister with regard to the Budget Proposal for the Appropriation Bill 2018. The statement signed by the President of the SLMA Professor Chandrika Wijeyaratne under the heading ?The Tax on Alcohol and Tobacco Products and the availability of Alcohol Products? states as follows:
In its Budget proposal for the Appropriation Bill 2018, the Sri Lanka Medical Association says that prices of cigarettes and alcohol should be increased
No evidence anywhere in the world that tourists visit specific countries to consume alcohol; Even if it was the case,?Sri Lanka should surely not aspire to be one of them
?The Expert Committee on Tobacco, Alcohol and Illicit Drugs of the Sri Lanka Medical Association (SLMA) recommends that the taxation and price of tobacco and alcohol products should be increased this year to further reduce the affordability of these products.??
One important consideration that is usually overlooked is that the majority of the adult population in Sri Lanka does not use tobacco or alcohol. Over 85% of adults do not smoke and over 80% of adults do not consume alcohol, according to the statistics of the Ministry of Health.?
A study by the National Authority on Tobacco and Alcohol (NATA), SLMA and the World Health Organization (WHO) showed that the annual economic cost of tobacco and alcohol use was at least Rupees 209 billion in Sri Lanka. Therefore, in this case, a minority habit causes extensive economic and social harm to the entire population of the country. The only beneficiaries of this situation are the industries that produce and market these products.?
The Expert Committee recommends that the price of such products should increase in view of the following reasons:?
?
?Making alcohol and tobacco more affordable and available will lead to more young people taking up alcohol and tobacco and lead to more problems in society, an increase in health care bills and much suffering for individuals and their families.?
There is no evidence anywhere that tourists visit specific countries to consume alcohol. Even if it was the case...should surely not aspire to be one of them... The ?tourist industry? is another bogey by the industry, which seems to have misled several policy makers.
?
Scientific research has shown that the overall consumption or the per-capita consumption (consumption per person) comes down with price increases. As per capita consumption is proportionate to the extent of alcohol and tobacco related problems in a society, a reduction in alcohol and tobacco related problems will be seen with reduced consumption.?
	Econometric Studies also show that the tax increase will increase the government revenue at the same time. Agencies such as the World Health Organization strongly recommend increasing taxation to reduce harm and increase government revenue for both alcohol and tobacco. Both the tobacco and alcohol industries use the bogeys of ?smuggling? and ?increase? of illicit products and substitute products to mislead policy makers. There is no basis or sound evidence for these arguments, which are used by the industry lobby.?
	There is also very strong evidence that increasing the price of cigarettes and alcohol will also prevent young people including school children taking up to cigarettes and alcohol.?
	Both tobacco and alcohol are direct causes of poverty and poor health. It has been shown that the poor are the biggest beneficiaries of increasing the prices of these substances as they reduce their own consumption when the prices are increased. Therefore it is a pro-poor policy, not otherwise. The illicit trade should be dealt with by appropriate law enforcement and not by trying to compete by price.?
It has also been recently announced in Parliament that the Ministry of Tourism was seeking the relaxation of laws restricting the availability of alcohol products, to make such products easily available for ?tourists?,?
There is no evidence anywhere in the world that tourists visit specific countries to consume alcohol. Even if it was the case, Sri Lanka should surely not aspire to be one of them.?
The ?tourist industry? is another bogey by the industry, which seems to have misled several policy makers. The effect of increasing availability of alcohol will simply increase the use of alcohol by Sri Lankans, not tourists.?
There is ample evidence that increasing the availability of alcohol will not only increase its use, but also escalate social problems, such as domestic violence and other forms of violence and road traffic accidents.?
The effects mentioned on the tourism industry seem irrelevant when it comes to the strata of tourists, who in fact bring in foreign currency. These tourists will anyhow stay in star class hotels and do have access to alcoholic beverages.?
Hence, we strongly recommend increasing the tax on alcohol and tobacco products, taking into account inflation and affordability. The SLMA also requests the Government of Sri Lanka not to initiate any steps towards relaxing the licensing and other laws which will enable alcohol to be available and accessible easily.? ?

EC briefs political parties in view of LG Polls
	
Elections Commission Chairman Mahinda Deshapriya yesterday briefed representatives of the political parties about electioneering under the new system in view of the upcoming local government elections, it is learnt.
The meeting took place yesterday evening in his office. He briefed them about the procedure set out regarding vote canvassing, the handing over of nomination papers, vote counting at polling stations and the presence of political party representatives.
Mr. Deshapriya said the elections could be conducted well within the month of January, 2018 if the gazette notification, announcing the number of members to be elected to each ward, were released before December 7.
After a meeting chaired by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe recently, some ruling party politicians announced January 27 as the day of polling.
In response, Mr. Deshapriya conveyed his displeasure about such announcement saying it was a matter for his office to decide. Incensed by such announcement, he said the Commission would not dare to conduct polling on a day other than January 27.
The local government elections will be conducted for the first time under a new system in January, next year. It is a mix of the First Past the Post System and the Proportional Representation System. Mr. Deshapriya said he would not favour conducting the polls in December because of the G.C.E. Ordinary Level Examination scheduled. Also, he said if the elections were to be conducted early January, the latter part of December would have to be dedicated as part of the canvassing period.
?It will also affect the exam activities,? he said.
Therefore, it transpired that the day of polling would fall towards the end of January. Most likely, it will be either January 20 or 27.
Government representative Deputy Minister Lasantha Alagiyawanna said the gazette notification would be released within the next couple of days. (Kelum Bandara)

Hidden threats of antibiotics
	
?
? Powerful antibiotics are prescribed for trivial illnesses. Some doctors love to cure their patients fast to maintain a high profile in the medical profession. They prescribe powerful antibiotics for children as well. The long - term effect of this is that those children develop the ?resistance? to antibiotics. This leads to the condition where more powerful medicines have to be prescribed to cure the simplest of diseases.?
Antibiotics are mostly used to treat bacterial infection - related diseases. Antibiotics can control the multiplying growth of bacteria or destroy it. Therefore, it is significant to take the prescribed dose of antibiotics during the due time span to experience the best results.??
Antibiotics should be taken only with a doctor?s prescription. This type of medicine isn?t suitable to treat influenza, Diarrhea or other virus - caused diseases. Antibiotics don?t fight viruses and many virus-caused diseases. It is the immune system that fights and cures this type of disease automatically.??
Using antibiotics inappropriately will cause ?antibiotic resistance? - which builds the resistance to viruses. If antibiotics are used long-term the drugs will have less effect in the fight against viruses. This antibiotic resistance has become an uprising and a common issue globally. Patients themselves are requesting powerful antibiotics from doctors.? ?
Therefore, these advices should be followed when taking antibiotics.??
Use antibiotics only when it is necessary.??
Avoid having antibiotics without the doctor?s recommendation.??
Follow the doctor?s advice when taking the dosage of antibiotics during a recommended time span.??
Do not stop taking antibiotics before controlling the disease completely.? ?
Do not keep the unused tablets stored at home and do not pass your medicine to others.?
?
Check for the expiration date of drugs? ?
It is advisable not to have antibiotics without a doctor?s prescription when dealing with a virus infection.??
Antibiotics like Penicillin could cause highly sensitive allergic reactions.Those could be severe to mild in intensity. Itching, swelling around the eyes and rashes in the skin are the symptoms of a mild allergy. If any allergic reaction appears, it?s advisable to stop continuing the medicine and seek medical assistance immediately. If the reactions are severe, like anaphhylaxis, one?s life would be in danger. During instances like that, the patient should be hospitalized soon and be treated fast.
Breathing difficulties, a drop in blood pressure, vomiting and fainting are common symptoms during such situations. If there has been a reaction to Penicillin or any other antibiotic, one must inform the doctor. It will be easier for the doctor to prescribe the suitable antibiotic then. Inquiring from the doctor about the complications and side effects of medicine brings good advice.??
According to the severity of the infection, antibiotics could be given via the mouth or in the form of? an injection. If the patient is a child, medicine can be given in the form of a syrup. Syrup is made by? pharmacists with given powder provided. If the powder is provided by the pharmacy, in place of the syrup, ask for directions as to how to make the syrup.??
The absorption of some antibiotics could be controlled by some food. The absorption would be immense if Erythromycin or Oral penicillin is given before the meal. Let the doctor define the dose and time of taking medicine; whether it is to be taken before or after the meals.??
Some antibiotics aren?t really safe for pregnant women. Certain other drugs might be unsafe for the foetus as well. No drugs should be taken without the recommendation of a doctor during pregnancy. Informing the doctor of a pregnancy is a must during any situation that you visit a doctor.? ?
Amoxicillin, Cloxacillian, benzylpenicilln, Co - amoxiclav, erythromycin, Ciprofloxacin, Cefalexing and tetracycling are among common antibiotics.??
( The details were obtained from a booklet published on frequently used drugs.)??

JFK assassination: Trump declassifies thousands of files
	
The US government has released 2,800 previously classified files on the assassination of President John F Kennedy in 1963, the BBC reported today.
US President Donald Trump has said the public deserved to be "fully informed" about the event, which has been the subject of numerous conspiracy theories.
However, some documents have still been withheld at the request of government agencies.
One memo revealed that the FBI had warned police of a death threat against the assassin Lee Harvey Oswald.
"We at once notified the chief of police and he assured us Oswald would be given sufficient protection", writes the FBI director J Edgar Hoover.
Oswald, a former Marine and self-proclaimed Marxist, was shot dead in the basement of the Dallas Police department two days after President Kennedy was killed.
Other findings include a CIA memo that suggests Oswald spoke with a KGB officer at the Russian embassy in Mexico City.
The memo says the KGB officer Oswald spoke with worked for a department "responsible for sabotage and assassination".
Another memo showed that Soviet officials feared an "irresponsible general" would launch a missile at the USSR in the wake of President Kennedy's death.
One memo tells how a British regional newspaper, the Cambridge News, received an anonymous call about "some big news" in the US, hours before the assassination.
A copy of the memo was released by the National Archives in the US in July, but had gone unreported.
President Kennedy was shot dead on 22 November 1963 as he travelled through Dallas in an open-topped limousine.
The Warren Commission's report into the shooting, published in September 1964, said that Lee Harvey Oswald had fired the fatal shots from the Texas School Book Depository building.
There was "no evidence that either Lee Harvey Oswald or Jack Ruby was part of any conspiracy, domestic or foreign", the commission said.
A 1992 law passed by Congress required all records related to the assassination - around five million pages - to be publicly disclosed in full within 25 years.
Allegations of a government cover-up are unlikely to be assuaged by reports that the CIA, FBI, Department of State and other agencies lobbied at the last minute to keep certain documents under wraps.
In a memo directing heads of executive departments to release the files, Mr. Trump has said the American public deserves to be "fully informed about all aspects of this pivotal event".
"Therefore, I am ordering today that the veil finally be lifted," the President wrote.
Some redacted documents are undergoing a further six-month review, but it is possible those records could stay secret after the deadline on 26 April next year.
The president, according to White House officials, was reluctant to agree to agency requests to hold the remaining documents.
"I have no choice - today - but to accept those redactions rather than allow potentially irreversible harm to our Nation's security," Mr. Trump added in his memo.

Learn about Nephrotic Syndrome in children
	
Ever heard of the term Nephrotic Syndrome? Even if you haven?t, you might be familiar with a disease where small children lose protein with their urine. This condition requires them to be hospitalized and be on long term drugs. If you notice such symptoms it?s likely that you have Nephrotic Syndrome. The reason that this condition demands attention is because it makes the child more susceptible to certain infections. In addition, in rare cases, it has the potential to cause chronic kidney failure in small children.?
Health Capsule this week decided to consult Dr.Deepal Perera, Consultant Paediatrician at the Lady Ridgeway Hospital for Children, to obtain a professional?s advice regarding this potentially debilitating condition for the benefit of our reader.??
?
Definition?
Nephrotic Syndrome isn?t a disease in itself, but a collection of symptoms. These symptoms occur due to changes in the kidney tissues. The microscopic structures within the kidney, termed nephrons, are the units that filter blood. Blood is pumped in small vessels through the unit called the glomerulus, which has very small pores that allow fluid and waste to escape outside the vessel. This unit at the same time helps keep the blood cells and other proteins inside. According to Dr. Perera, in Nephrotic syndrome, our body?s immune system damages the glomerulus, allowing protein to escape.
?
? ?
Symptoms?
Most of the children presenting with this condition are between 2-5 years; boys presenting commoner than girls. ?The most frequent complaint is the swelling of the face, specially around the eyes. Some others may present with whole body swelling,? said the doctor.??
Some may also present with reduced urine output and blood in urine. This condition may also resemble a urine infection where there is pain during urination. Fever might be one of the symptoms in this condition.??
?Even though patients usually present with these conditions, there are four salient features associated with Nephrotic syndrome. These symptoms help us differentiate the condition from other disease conditions,? continued Dr. Perera. The four features are:??
1.Reduced protein in the blood (Hypoproteinemia)??
2.Generalized body swelling??
3.High Cholesterol levels in blood??
4.Passing of protein in blood (Proteinuria)??
?A similar condition to Nephrotic Syndrome is Acute Glomerular Nephritis, in which the salient features are blood in urine, Hypertension and reduced urine output?, explained Dr. Perera. He further explained that coming to a definitive diagnosis is important in treating the patient. The child may also be referred to a kidney specialist if the doctor deems it necessary.??
?
Complications
One might wonder why Nephrotic Syndrome is so worrisome if these features are the only ones present in a child. But proteins in blood do a great deal of work, function-wise. Proteins have the ability to retain water within the blood vessels through attraction. forces When there is a lack of protein, the fluid portion in the blood leaks out from the vessels into the surrounding spaces like the pleura of the lungs and abdominal cavity. These are ideal grounds for bacteria to grow in. In addition, some of the proteins that are lost have an immune function in the body which is to protect it from external micro organisms. During this condition this function fails to take place. Therefore these children are more susceptible to infections when compared with other children.? ?Also, due to the leaking of fluid to the outside, the volume of blood reduces, which may cause the patient to go into shock, if he is not kept hydrated.? ?In addition, there is an increased possibility in these patients to develop blood clots, due to the increasing of the thickness of the blood. This will result in conditions like Deep Vein Thrombosis.??
Other complications that they might experience are High Blood Pressure, Kidney failure, which may resolve after treatment.? In some cases these conditions may lead to Chronic Kidney Failure, and rare heart conditions due to increased Cholesterol.??
?
Treatment
After the diagnosis, the patient?s blood pressure and urine protein would be monitored daily. Patients are treated long term with the drug Prednisolone; a steroid, according to the doctor. ?If the child doesn?t respond to steroids, we may have to prescribe alternative treatments?, explained the doctor. A special diet comprising of low cholesterol and low salt food is also recommended. Even though protein is lost through urine, high a protein diet isn?t advisable.??
Nephotic Syndrome, as explained earlier, isn?t a disease, but an underlying cause like Lupus or an infection and may be the causative factor. So, finding out if there is an underlying disease and treating it is an important step in the treatment process.??
?
Relapses
?One of the biggest worries in Nephrotic Syndrome is it?s tendency to relapse?, said Dr. Perera. Therefore, even after being discharged from hospital, the child has to be on long-term steroid therapy. The parents are taught to check the child?s urine for traces of protein at home, so that a relapse can be recognized early.??
?
Follow-up
For children who have had Nephrotic Syndrome, it?s extremely important to follow the drug regimen as per the doctor?s advice. It is also a must to bring the child for regular follow-ups, even if he shows no signs of a relapse. This is because even though steroid therapy is essential as the cure, the child needs to be monitored for the possible development of adverse effects of the drug itself, which may include growth retardation and adrenal suppression.??
Even though modern medicine has advanced in leaps and bounds much is yet to be discovered on the how?s and why?s of Nephrotic Syndrome. But, early detection and treatment will aid in preventing and minimizing the complications associated with the condition. Therefore the doctor cautions parents to seek immediate medical care if their children display symptoms of Nephrotic Syndrome which include; facial and body edema, frothy urine and reduced urine output.??

LG Polls: Gazette notice likely next week
	
Local Government and Provincial Councils Minister Faizer Musthapha said today he would issue the gazette notification on the amendments to The Local Authorities Elections (Amendment) Bill, which was approved by Parliament in August.
He told a news briefing yesterday that he would submit the amendments to the Cabinet on Tuesday and issue the gazette notice on the next day giving ample time to the Elections Commission to conduct the local government polls in January next year.
?I have prepared the ground work and it is now up to the EC to set the date for the match. The amendments will be gazetted making them effective from the the day on which the Act was enacted,? the minister said.
Responding to a question asked by the Daily Mirror, he said three more pradeshiya sabhas will set up in Ambagamuwa and Nuwara Eliya under the amendments and said a fresh demarcation for the six pradshiya sabhas would not be necessary because new PSs will be set up within the existing wards of Amabagamuwa and Nuwara Eliya.
"The two Pradeshiya Sabhas have over a population of 200,000 necessitating the broadbasing of local government administration," the minister said.
?For instance, the Ambagamuwa PS has 30 wards for a population of about 200,000. This PS will be divided to three Pradeshiya Sabhas with 10 wards for each Pradeshiya Sabha. The same method will be applied for the Nuwara Eliya PS,? he said.
The minister said there was an all party meeting chaired by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe last week with the political party leaders demanding that the LG polls be conducted without any further delay.
?If we wanted to we could have further delayed the LG polls based on demands to divide Samanthurai Pradeshiya Sabha in Kalmunai to four. Even the Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe has promised the SLMC and TNA to do it. But it needs more time and further amendments to the LG Electoral Act which will take few more years and we decided not to go ahead with this proposal," he said.
The minster said the delay in conducting LG polls was because of a controversial paragraph inserted to the Local Authorities Elections (Amendment) Bill that required to ignore the mandatory requirement of 25% women representation from a political party but this had been rectified.

Maldives Passport Card is a Mastercard biometric debit card issued by the Bank of Maldives. It is a dual- interface chip card with additional features and applications. It is the first payment card in the world by a network which has the passport, national ID and driving licence of the cardholder in one plastic card.?
The Mastercard Passport Card can be used for a wide range of purposes/services. Primarily, the Passport Card is an identity travel document complying with the ICAO data standards allowing it to be used at e-gates at Male International Airport. Additionally, it can be used for identity verification by law enforcement agencies. It can also be used to provide government services such as medical services and other e-services.
The card can be utilized as a special insurance card when required, for cashless health insurance services and motor insurance policy verification. The Mastercard Passport Card is the world?s first bank card, which is made of polycarbonate material that can last up to 10 years. The flexibility of the Passport Card allows additional services and information to be incorporated to the card. E-services such as e-transport, academic information, medical information and many more can be included. For added security, the card will contain the biometric data of the cardholder, such as fingerprints.?
The card is certified by Mastercard and the Bank of Maldives allowing the cardholders to use it internationally like any other Mastercard. The additional passport security features makes the card more secure than any other payment card in the market today. This streamlined solution reduces the need to carry other documents and provides the cardholder with a secure and convenient method of payment. Commenting on the Passport Card, Mastercard Country Manager Sri Lanka and Maldives R.B. Santosh Kumar said, ?We are honoured to have presented the Passport Card to the president. At Mastercard, we are focused on providing our customers with innovative payment solutions and enhanced payment experiences. Hence, we believe that by introducing a Passport Card with the Government of Maldives we will be reducing hassle and improving overall experiences. And by incorporating the payment method into such vital documentation, it will help facilitate greater financial inclusion.?

6.3 mn people voted to institute new Constitution: Mangala
	
Finance Minister Mangala Samaraweera responding to a controversial statement made by a former military officer to the effect that anyone supporting a new Constitution for the country should be killed, said that the retired military officer has made this terrifying statement despite the fact that 63 lakhs of voters asserted in 2015 that a new constitution must be instituted in this country to achieve sustainable peace, stability, reconciliation and prosperity for our nation.
The Minister added that such statements were made at a time when the Unity Government, as a people-oriented and democratic government, led by President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe were working towards fulfilling this responsibility entrusted to them by the people.
At a recent event held under the patronage of former Defence Secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa recently, under the banner of ?viyathmaga?, a former military officer has said that anyone supporting a new Constitution for the country should be killed. Recalling the 88-89 era of terror, he had gone on to say that this should be done using the label ?death to traitors?, and that this label should be tattooed on people before they are executed, and that the remains of those who are thus killed should not be raised above the knee-level of the pall-bearers. He adds that that the remains of those executed should not be shown any respect that is traditionally shown to the dead in our country,? Minister Samaraweera said.
?He has made this terrifying statement despite the fact that 63 lakhs of voters in this country, in 2015, asserted victoriously, that a new constitution must be instituted in this country, for achieving sustainable peace, stability, reconciliation, and prosperity in our nation; and at a time when the Unity Government, as a people-oriented and democratic government, led by His Excellency the President and the Honorable the Prime Minister, are working towards fulfilling this responsibility entrusted to them by the people, Minister Samaraweera he stressed.
Such statements make it very clear that the defeated, power-hungry forces in our country, who don?t value democracy, have got into a frenzy of insanity as they cannot bear to witness the President and the Prime Minister winning the confidence and trust of the public, both locally and internationally, by steering this nation successfully on a democratic path.
While it is really not worth spending ones time to respond to such insane and outrageous statements made by racist elements, I felt that I must speak up on behalf of the large majority of people in this country who value democracy and who denounce the statements and actions of those who today seem to be suffering as a result of not being able to perform somersaults on dead bodies and satisfy their bloodlust by unleashing their brute force on the innocent public.
During the initial days when ?viyathmaga? was launched as a means to seek to realize Rajapaksa?s future political ambitions, I remarked that this would take our country on a ?vipathmaga? ? ?a path of doom?. They themselves have today proved this to be true.
The fact that the founding father of the white van culture in this country, Mr. Rajapaksa?s unending dream of unleashing endless brutal terror has still not faded away, is proven again and again by the terrifying statements that emerge from the blood-thirsty movements such as this, that have been set up on his behalf.
The person named Kamal Gunaratna cast the entire Sri Lanka Army in bad light and betrayed the Army through his book named ?Handikadal? in which he described how they unleashed deadly attacks on innocent civilians in the north and looted their property. He even described how he derived sadistic pleasure by witnessing such ruthless acts. Moreover, investigations are currently ongoing in relation to an allegation pertaining to the mysterious death of a Sri Lankan employee during the time he was working as a diplomat.
?Isn?t what Gunaratna is now engaged in, in order to satisfy the bloodlust of his master, in fact aiding the arguments and war crimes allegations directed at the security forces by certain parties?? Minister Samaraweera questioned.
Sarath Weerasekera, who constantly spews out racist remarks, as an obedient spokesperson for Gotabaya Rajapaksa, has also called for all who support a new constitution to be killed.
Parliamentarian Wimal Weerawansa, who has made racist thuggery his brand of political strategy, has stated that Parliament should be bombed so that the constitution could not be passed. By following the example of his brother-in-law who carried out a bomb attack in Parliament in the past, he is now attempting to make people recall the 88-89 era of terror, revealing to the nation, his brand of brutal politics.
If these people have the audacity to fearlessly make such dangerous and terrifying statements so openly from public platforms when they are not in power, intelligent citizens of this country, I am sure, can make their own assessments about the nature of their behavior and actions and the crimes that they may have committed when they were in power, with full state authority at their command. These people now have the audacity to threaten to cause harm to the lives of the intelligent and wise citizens of our country who value democracy and who support a new constitution!
Reminding us that ?though the jungle in which a tiger dwells may be changed, his spots do not change? this ruthless group has demonstrated to us now that irrespective of whether they are in power or not, they behave in the same manner as blood-thirsty murderers.
The people of this country have still not forgotten the Rajapaksa era during which mysterious secret murderous groups used to be deployed to abduct civilians, media personnel and others in white vans, and make them disappear.
Over 62 lakhs of people in this country called for a new constitution in order to ensure that such a dangerous era of terror would not be unleashed on our country again. Such ruthless leaders were defeated and rejected by the people because the people of this country have experienced, and are well aware of the dangerous and fearful nature of such authoritarian leadership. Therefore, it is not necessary to give them another opportunity.
We are committed to take all necessary steps to establish sustainable peace and reconciliation in our country. We are committed to ensure that no power-hungry ruthless forces derail the democratic path that we tread to realize the vision of a peaceful, stable, reconciled and prosperous Sri Lanka.
Similarly, I stress that we are prepared, determined and committed to join hands with all the progressive and peace-loving people of our country, to once again defeat the blood-thirsty, ruthless forces to ensure the preservation of democracy and human values in our country.

## Title: Ondine?s Curse and Respiratory Physiology

Ondine?s Curse and Respiratory Physiology
	
?
Each and every organ in our body needs energy to function. The process of generating energy in humans requires Oxygen, and generates Carbon Dioxide as a waste product. Blood collects this Carbon Dioxide, repleting the cell?s oxygen supply from its own supply. Then the blood returns to the heart and it is then distributed throughout the vessels of the lungs. The lungs take away the excess Carbon Dioxide and replete the Oxygen in the blood with the atmospheric Oxygen. This is a very simplified explanation of the basic functions of respiration.? ?
But have you ever thought of how amazing the process of respiration is? While you are reading this, your lungs are busy, keeping you alive. Even when you are asleep the respiration continues, since the body?s need for energy doesn?t cease just because you are not awake. But, unlike other vital functions in our body, like the beating of the heart or the filtering of the kidneys, we can control our respiration to an extent. You can decide on the rate and depth of respiration for an instance; try holding your breath and hyperventilating. But did you know that you can?t die by holding your breath? Even if you suppress the brain?s screams of ?Breath now?, the reduced oxygen flow to your brain will cause you to faint, after which the respiration would resume automatically.? ?
After that brief explanation regarding this vast topic, I?m going to relate a story. This is a folk tale about two lovers to be precise. The story, titled Ondine?s Curse, is about a water nymph named Ondine, who fell in love with a mortal. If a water nymph, who is immortal, falls in love with a human, she will become a mortal, with its accompanying grievances like sickness, ageing and death. But the mortal, named Palemon, sweet talked Ondine into becoming his wife, pledging that his every waking breath would be a pledge of his love and faithfulness to her. But he went back on his words and cheated on Ondine after finding another woman. Ondine, devastated by his betrayal, cursed Palemon using his own words. He was to breathe only when he is awake and whenever he slept, he would ?forget? to breath.? ?
What does Ondine have to do with today?s article? A lot, since today we are talking about a condition called Ondine?s Curse, where the person stops breathing when he/she is asleep. Respiration is mainly involuntary, controlled by the brain stem. This includes starting inspiration when the body?s carbon dioxide levels are high and the oxygen levels are low, preventing the lungs from over inflating, coordinating the time and depth of respiration among other things. But, the cerebral cortex, which is the part of the brain which makes conscious or voluntary decisions, also has a say in it. What happens in Ondine?s curse, otherwise called ?Central Hypoventilation Syndrome?, is that the ?involuntary? part of the brain fails to act, so the voluntary control is what sustains breathing. The cerebral cortex is at rest during sleep, and thus, without voluntary control, the patient may stop breathing. Do I need to explain what the result will be???
?
The objective of this article isn?t to worry you of the perils of Ondine?s Curse, since, this condition (Fortunately) is extremely rare. And with the advancement of medicine, these patients can now sleep without the fear of death with the assistance of mechanical ventilation. But hopefully, it will inspire our readers to explore more of the thousands of interesting stories disguised in the form of medical jargon. When I first heard the story, narrated by one of our lecturers, I also got an appreciation for the sense of humour of the scientists who discover these conditions, who we imagine to be hardcore geeks, but in reality, are everyday humans, just like you and I!??

Our curious contradiction
	
The protests work for the protestors and their backers, whether they win or lose. On the other hand, even if they win, the protests rarely work for the people. Those behind them win whatever the outcome, while the people lose even if they are supposed to win
A man in Polonnaruwa died because of a power outage (the nearest hospital didn?t have a generator; by the time he was despatched to the city hospital, he was dead). He was 55. The Government?s fault? Hardly.
Part of the reason why strikes never really work today, unless enough effort is put into them, is that the people are tired. They are tired of looking for scapegoats to censure and criticise.
A friend of mine, having seen through last month?s spate of strikes rather cynically, had an interesting point to make: ?The protests work for the protestors and their backers, whether they win or lose. On the other hand, even if they win, the protests rarely work for the people. Those behind them win whatever the outcome, while the people lose even if they are supposed to win.??
Such an observation is of course crass when considering that not all protests have reneged on the public and that most if not many of them, if history is a good indicator, have served that same public. But then you do get his point: protests are political, and protestors, particularly today?s protestors, have become ineffectual.?
September and October were bewildering. To say the least. First, the weather: abnormal, destructive, ruthless. Then the strikes-touching on almost everything from electricity to the railways. The demands were all the same: Rectify salary anomalies or face the consequences. There were areas outside Colombo which suffered power outages for over five days. Yes, five days. And there were people, whose daily routine consisted of going to work at nine in the morning and coming back home at nine in the night, who found themselves stuck when the trains they were on stopped over a sudden strike, forcing them to either walk the rest of the way home or wait until the SLTB sorted the mess.?
In all these instances the strikers had one thing to say: ?If the people find it difficult to get about their work, then it is the Government?s fault.? But then a man in Polonnaruwa died because of a power outage (the nearest hospital didn?t have a generator; by the time he was despatched to the city hospital, he was dead). He was 55. The Government?s fault? Hardly.?
Which brings me to my point: Part of the reason why strikes never really work today, unless enough effort is put into them, is that the people are tired. They are tired of looking for scapegoats to censure and criticise.?
They know the Government isn?t any better, but they also know that this is arguably the worst time since the war years for strikes to take place. When times are tough, when protests are by default the order of the day, they look at those they can blame the quickest. Not the State, but the striker.?
It?s a well known fact that in Sri Lanka, antipathy towards trade unionism is informed less by political inclinations than by personal prejudices. It?s interesting to note that whether one supports this Government or its predecessor, one continues to view these protests as an inconvenience.?
Those for the Government wish it to use the power it has (but rarely uses) against them, even hinting at violence before a crisis imposes it as a necessity. Those for the predecessor curse the Government based on what they feel their preferred political candidates would have done were they elected: Again, use power and violence to quell these strikes.?
They try to be modernists, political or cultural, sincere in their intentions, but then when the moment of reckoning comes they find their inability to think beyond sustaining their milieu a good enough reason to abscond the ideals??
And that?s just what members of the unofficial opposition want: get the incumbent regime to commit hara-kiri by resorting to force and then diminish their sense of moral superiority. For the record, they haven?t resorted to it yet.?
Voters here identify with and idealise a man of force in power. Even those who advertise democracy and individual rights, from a legal or humanistic perspective, tend to wallow before preferred political outcomes that give rise to such men of force. It is this fascination with contemporary supermen (in a disturbingly Nietzschean, neo-fascist sense) which has divided our polity into two intertwined political movements that don?t differ from each other.?
By this I am not really disparaging one particular movement and taking sides with another, rather just pointing out that the so-called divide between the progressives and the reactionaries has never been sustained in Sri Lanka: Our progressives become reactionaries once they reach Parliament, and even our bitterest and most conservative reactionaries become liberals once they are swept over to the opposition.?
My point is that despite Sri Lanka being a former bastion of radicalism and trade unionism, protests and strikes will not and cannot work in a context where the people opt for one of those two aforementioned political movements.?
That this Government has not resorted to cracking down forcefully on dissidents is good (I can?t imagine a former Government, from living memory, tolerating a week-long strike at the Electricity Board without doing something about it), but then from various comments I got down from people ? everyday, ordinary, mostly middle class though not consumerist, the sort who commute to Colombo from Galle and Beruwala on the train ? I have realised that they are taking the people they have elected, or are opposing, as powerless, irresolute.?
They may not know much about political history of other countries but from those conversations one name and one country crop up frequently. Lee Kuan Yew. Singapore.?
The obsession of Sri Lanka?s anti-trade union bourgeoisie with the politics and politicians of East Asia is both fascinating and silly. To start things off, no two regions could have been structurally more different, in terms of economics or pretty much everything else. In an intriguing but relevant article written on the pre-1977 economy (which was when trade unionism thrived, even under the political right), Vinod Moonesinghe contended that three factors differentiated us from the Asian Tigers: That compared to them we didn?t implement wide ranging land reforms, that we ran out of foreign exchange because of the rice ration and the culture of democracy we implemented successfully after 1948 and 1956, and that we did not enjoy the benefit of friendship with the Atlantic powers, especially the USA, which East Asia did.?
Given this, the attempts we made to become an industrial hub, during the Sirimavo Bandaranaike regime, were at most half-hearted and abortive, and would quickly be dismantled in the name of robber baron capitalism.?
It is this fascination with contemporary supermen (in a disturbingly Nietzschean, neo-fascist sense) which has divided our polity into two intertwined political movements that don?t differ from each other.?
This curious contradiction ? between who we want to be and who we are ? explains why our bourgeoisie are rather stunted, hybridised, never really in one place for a long time, reactionary when in power and liberal when out of it, and irresolute.?
They try to be modernists, political or cultural, and they have a whole horde of artistes, intellectuals, professors, and civil society activists who are, I daresay, sincere in their intentions, but then when the moment of reckoning comes they find their inability to think beyond sustaining their milieu a good enough reason to abscond the ideals those intellectuals and activists stand for.?
The anti-trade unionism this country has been swept with in recent years is, I believe, something we inherited because of the empowerment of that bourgeoisie, who tend to fill and inherit the corridors of power whatever the Government and political party they are backing. They idealise Singapore but find themselves poorly equipped for the task of transforming their ideals into a breathing, living reality.?
So, if we take the electorate, or ourselves, as a reflection of who we elect, it?s only natural that our fondness for men of force over men of integrity runs concurrently with our political bourgeoisie?s inability to formulate a proper vision for the country and its people. Whatever the political movement, it?s almost always intertwined with the political movement it opposes, through that bourgeoisie.?
What happens in the end is that we are all tired, of our leaders and those who oppose them. Naturally then, trade unionism and student movements here, in recent years, have been lost on our people. The reason for that, more than anything else, is the fact that we have conditioned ourselves to accept the political moment, whether or not we are content with it, and let our private lives go on undisturbed. The moment it?s disturbed, and not just disturbed but downright distracted, we denounce those who protest in favour of the men and women they protest against. Even if those being protested against happen to be those we want out of power.?

Smart IDs from today
	
The smart identification card (Smart ID) was launched to the public today by the Department of Registration of Persons (DRP), Department Commissioner General Viyani Gunathilaka said.
To symbolize the Inauguration of the Smart ID, the first printed Smart ID was handed over to Wayamba Development and Cultural Affairs Minister S. B. Nawinne and fifteen other applicants who applied today at the ceremony.
Speaking at the event Mr. Gunathilaka said all National Identity cards would be renewed with front-facing images prior to converting them to Electronic Identity (E-ID) Cards.
He said the Smart ID programme was a huge challenge for the department however achieved the goal with many difficulties.
?The manual process was initiated in 1972 and the entire process changed to an automated form from Thursday evenin after receiving all the relevant electronic equipment. By initiating this process, the government plans to re-register all citizens and create a National Persons? Registry (NPR). In our country, we never had a database such as NPR. We have already made the legal background for this and within a short period of time we will begin the collection of information for the NPR database,? Mr. Gunathilaka said.
The database will include information such as the blood group, family details and other personal information will be included in the registry, which could only be viewed by high ranking officials in the Department and law enforcement authorities under special circumstances.
The Commissioner went on to say that all details mentioned in the existing ID will be available in the new ID in all three languages, in addition to biometric data such as finger prints as well as a personalize bar code.
This Smart ID will be issued only for new applicants and renewals and is not compulsory for all citizens to obtain the Smart ID immediately.
?The existing identity card is valid. After the completion of the NPR, new ID?s will be mailed to those who are already registered in the system. This process will atleast take a year to be implemented,? he said.
The department is looking forward to decentralizing the system to ease the issuance of the ID and several Divisional Secretaries had already been given the facility.
The photos in Smart IDs issued from October, 27 will be engraved on a special polycarbonate plastic with the use of laser technology.
?This Smart ID is an interim solution before issuing the Electronic Identity (E-ID), which does not have an expiry date, unlike the EID which expires every ten years. The expiry date will be printed on the E-ID after completing the NPR and the IDs of those between the ages of 15 and 40 should be renewed every ten years. School children in grade 10 who are 15 years of their age can apply for the NIC before sitting for the General Certificate of Education (GCE) O/L. The ID?s of those over the age of 40 will need no change. The ID?s will be made according to international standards and will use a special software provided by the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO). So far, the department has registered close to 1,700 studios countrywide. These studios have already installed the software provided by the ICAO, and the photos will be sent to the department online. The DRP has decided to launch a new registry for Sri Lankans by the end of next year. After collecting data, the department will issue Electronic Identity (E-ID) Cards by the end of 2018 or beginning of 2019,? Mr. Gunathilaka said. (Chaturanga Pradeep)

## Title: Strokes can be prevented only if you know!

Strokes can be prevented only if you know!
	
?
Out of the population of 21 million in the country, there are 200,000 who have survived strokes. Strokes are a serious threat to the quality of health and a severe medical malady. As world Stroke Day is around the corner (October 29), Health Capsule interviewed Dr. Padma Gunaratne, Senior Consultant Neurologist and Head of the Stroke Unit, National Hospital of Sri Lanka, to raise awareness on strokes and to minimize the number of deaths due to this ailment. Providing insightful knowledge on strokes, she accentuated that strokes are preventable. It?s all a matter of being aware which would contribute towards a healthier nation.? ?
?
Definition? ?
A stroke occurs secondary due to problems in the blood vessels supplying the brain. ?Every tissue in our body requires proper blood supply to function. The blood supply consists of oxygen, glucose and other nutrients. The structure of the brain is such that every cell has a functional significance. Different areas of the brain are specialized for different functions. There are three (3) main blood vessels that provide blood supply to the brain. These arteries branch further into arterioles and capillaries ensuring that each cell of the brain receives an adequate blood supply. When the blood supply to a particular part of the brain is disturbed (either by a block or rupture of the blood vessel), the cells deprived of the blood supply become dysfunctional. The consequence of this would lead to a stroke. Symptoms are determined based on the specified function of the affected part of the brain? explained Dr. Gunaratne.? ?Risk groups? ?
According to Dr. Gunaratne, research studies in Sri Lanka have indicated that 10 in every 1000 people suffer strokes. ?The Sri Lanka Stroke Clinical Registry states that all major hospitals in the island receive more than 1000 stroke patients per year. The prevalence of a stroke increases with age. But in Sri Lanka, 33% of stroke patients are under age 60 and in their productive years. 7% of strokes are young strokes, which prevail in people under age 45. Generally males suffer strokes more than females, but after 50 years, the prevalence of a stroke becomes equal. According to the Stroke Clinical Registry, 57% of males are stroke patients,? the doctor said.?
?
Causes? ?
The main reason for strokes is the thickening of the blood vessels, also known as atherosclerosis. There are many factors that contribute towards this condition. ?Some causes are reversible while others are not. Non- reversible factors such as ageing and genetics are beyond our control. So we should focus more on reversible factors that lead to strokes. There are 4 main risk factors that could lead to a stroke. They are lack of exercises, an unhealthy diet, alcohol and smoking,? she warned.? ?
These risk factors lead to obesity and also to conditions such as high blood pressure, high blood sugar and high cholesterol. People who have any of these conditions bear the risk of a stroke. Heart attacks and heart diseases also hold the high probability of strokes.?
?
?
Symptoms? ?
Dr. Gunaratne stressed that it?s of utmost importance to have proper knowledge with regard to the symptoms of strokes, so that a person can take immediate and appropriate action. ?A stroke is a brain attack. There are signs that warn of a stroke. Suddenly developed paralysis of the face, arm or leg is common. Speech would also be affected by strokes. The ability to express oneself and the ability to understand could be affected. These factors should raise strong suspicions of a stroke, which demand immediate action. Some may face numbness in half of the body, some may find difficulties in walking and retaining balance while some may experience it hard to maintain proper vision. The vision in one eye could be affected or only half of an object might be visible. Severe headaches, sudden loss of consciousness and not regaining consciousness are also symptoms of stroke,? said Dr. Gunaratne.?
?
Complications??
A stroke can leave a patient with disabilities. These include physical disabilities, where the mobility of a patient is affected adversely (inability to walk, move arms) owing to paralysis. Difficulties in communication also arise. Swallowing problems, losing control of the bladder and problems in vision are effects of a stroke. ?In addition, other problems such as depression, family issues and sexual problems, pain in limbs, social issues and economical issues may arise as long-term consequences,? added Dr. Gunaratne.?
?
Seeking medical help? ?
It?s strongly advised to seek medical attention at the slightest sign of any one of the symptoms mentioned above. Time is vital which is why knowledge of stroke symptoms is essential. ?Symptoms appear even 5 minute after there?s a blockage in a blood vessel. Some brain cells may die immediately. Most brain cells may be affected, but are still viable and contribute towards the symptoms experienced for a few hours. If the block is treated immediately, these cells could be revived. The time limit within which these cells can be revived lasts for only 4.5 hours after a blockage, so immediate treatment is required. Treatment should be sought from a major hospital that has appropriate facilities for treatment such as a CT scanner. Action should be taken immediately when experiencing symptoms,? she accentuated.? ?
?
Diagnosis and treatment? ?
When a person seeks medical treatment on the suspicion that it could be symptoms of a stroke, a CT scan is ordered. The CT scan helps exclude patients with burst blood vessel before the clot buster treatment is administered. ?Clot buster is an injection given to remove the blood clot by dissolving it. This injection is given within 4.5 hours from the time symptoms are experienced. This helps improve the outcome of the patient.? ?
Some patients are paralyzed and are unable to swallow. If these patients are given food stuff to swallow, they develop complications such as aspiration pneumonia. Therefore they are tube fed until they are able to swallow on their own.? ?
Paralyzed patients have to be turned constantly in order to prevent bed sores. The patient may suffer from other inconveniences such as soiling clothes, etc. ?So much nursing has to be done while the patient recovers. If the proper care isn?t given the patient could die,? the doctor warned.? ?
After the initial emergency care, during which the clot is dissolved and removed, the patient is cared for in the stroke unit by a team known as the multi disciplinary team. The team consists of a doctor, nurse, physiotherapist, occupational therapist, speech therapist, counsellor and social service officer. Together they nurse the patient back to normalcy. But according to Dr. Gunaratne this facility isn?t freely available in the country though and is a matter that should be looked into.? ?
?
Prevention? ?
Heart attacks and strokes share the same preventive measures. The probability of the thickening of blood vessels increases with age and with certain lifestyle factors. Therefore lifestyle modifications are necessary. Prevention can be taken with regard to the modifiable risk factors. This reduces the stroke risk by 90%. ?Adhering to a healthy diet, moderate exercise, avoiding smoking, limiting alcohol, monitoring one?s blood pressure and controlling it are some measures. Controlling cholesterol, diabetes and weight is essential. Being aware of the stroke symptoms and taking action immediately, even if symptoms settle, minimize the adverse effects of strokes. If one suffers from heart diseases appropriate medication should be taken to avoid strokes. Patients who have recovered from strokes should continue with their medication to reduce the risk of another attack,? advised Dr. Gunaratne.? ? ?

The Line of Mercury -indicator of longevity, health and business success
	
Human Hand ? Trailblazer of Human Civilization ? Part 29
?
?
The normal line of Mercury starts from above the Rascette and proceeds towards the Mount of Mercury without cutting the Life line.
This line is also known by several other names as well. It is called the Line of Liver, Line of Health and the Line of Hepatica. However, it is mostly called the Line of Health.
Health is the greatest wealth one can possess, they say. Because, one may possess fame, honour, wealth and comforts in life but if one is not in good health one?s fame and prosperity would serve no purpose.
The presence of clear and deep-cut Line of Health is rarely seen in a hand especially when the subject is past his youth. This line is absent in most hands. It is not a defect. Palmists agree that the persons without the Health line in the hand are vivacious and free from any liver trouble, and they find the life is indeed?worth living.
The Health Line can originate from any point in the hand but to deserve the name it should terminate at the Mount of Mercury.
This line starts mainly from the following places:
1. Mount of Venus
2. near the Life line
3. Mount of Moon or Luna
4. Bracelets?
5. Fate line
6. Mount of Mars
If the Health line starts from above the Rascette and proceeds up to the Mount of Mercury without touching the Life line, the subject would enjoy longevity and good health (especially of the digestive system) and success?in business.
If the line takes its course alongside the percussion, it would be taken for the line of Intuition. However, the real line of Intuition rises from the Mount of Moon and proceeds to the Upper Mars in sort of a semi-circle. Students of Palmistry when making predictions should be guided by the following rules:
1. If the line begins with a reddish tinge, the subject would suffer from a heart disease in his life.
2. If the line is yellow in colour, the subject would suffer from diseases of the genitals
3. If the line originates from the Mount of Moon and proceeds towards the Mount of Mercury along the percussion, the subject would go overseas several times in his life.
4. If this line is distinct and the Head line is strong, the subject has a sharp memory.
5. If a person has a long and distinct Health line and a short Life line, the former would make up for the insufficiency of the latter
6. If there is a sign of a rectangle at the end of the Health line, the subject suffers from Asthma.
7. If the Moon line meets the Health line, the subject is a successful poet and travels abroad several times.
8. If a wavy Head line touches the Fate line, the subject remains physically weak?
throughout life.
9. If there is a cross at the end of the Head line and the Health line, the subject?s life is a great success.
10. A cross near the Health line indicates that the subject would meet with several accidents.
11. A cross on the Health line says that the subject is of unsound mind.
12. If a double Health line touches the Mount of Sun, the subject would get high political office.
13. If the Health line rises from the Heart line like a branch off it and runs down to touch the Life line, the subject suffers from a weakness or a disease of the heart.
14. A chained line indicates a diseased liver and stomach.
15. A star on this line at the point it crosses the Head line in a woman?s hand indicates a serious gynecological problem or difficulties to be experienced at childbirth.

Utilizing Affinity Number formula for arriving at a more potent number
	
?
We presume that our readers are quite conversant with what the Birthdate Number is and the importance of harmonizing vital landmark events in their life with the Birthdate Number with a view to achieving the best possible results.?
One may find the signification of one?s Birthdate Number does not suit the effects that the Number denotes or signifies or his past experience has proved that the number is not favourable. One in such circumstances, could look for an affinity number which can be expected to produce the desired effects.?
Besides, certain numerologists say Number 1 is a number too sacred for success of worldly and material affairs. In such an eventuality, the subject can look for what is called an affinity number for use in day to day affairs for good luck.?
We have explained what Affinity Numbers are in a previous article. But we wish to recapitulate the Affinity Number concept for the convenience of readers.?
We know that there are nine Basic numbers and these nine basic Numbers are further classified under five groups on the basis of their affinity with each other as follows:?
(a) 1 and 4
(b)? 2 and 7
3,6 and 9
5?
8
You may have noted (i) type comes under two groupings (a) and (b). This means No: 1 people have affinity with No: 4 dates and No: 4 people and vice versa.? Further No:? 1 and 4 dates and people have affinity with No: 2 and No: 7 dates and people as well.? No: 3,6, and 9 dates and people have affinity? with each other, but affinity of No: 5 dates and people? is restricted to? only 5 dates and people and that of No: 8 people? is limited to? only No: 8 people.?
Thus the groupings of affinity numbers that No: 1 or No: 4 people can pick 2 or 7 as an alternative number for use.?
According to the numerological principle relating to harmony and vibration, No: 1 and No: 4 people should associate themselves as far as possible with the No: 2.?
If a Birthdate No: 8 person wants to get more fortunate vibrations or to avoid conflict with the No: 4 people, he can alter his Name value Number to obtain a more potent or positive number.? For example, say person? was born on the 8th, 17th or the 26 of a month, giving him 8 as the Birth Number, but still he can work out his Name value Number? to a Basic Number like 1,3,5 or 6 so that he can drop his Birth Number 8? in all transactions? and start? using the stronger? new number. A Number 4 person too can do likewise.?
Nevertheless, it must be emphasized it is the Birth Number that influences us most in our life.? In the first instance, it is inalterable, secondly, it reflects the cumulative planetary influence at birth and thirdly the mysterious law of vibration at the moment determines the note of harmony which continues to influence the natural pattern of life from the cradle to the grave.

Visa Country Manager completes week-long cashless journey across Sri Lanka
	
?
Last month, Visa Country Manager for Sri Lanka Anthony Watson travelled 1,168 kilometres around the country on a three-wheeler in the pursuit of going cashless and raising funds for charity as part of the 2017 Pimp My Tuk Tuk challenge.
This is the second year the Pimp My Tuk Tuk challenge has taken place in Sri Lanka and in 2017, the journey saw 52 local and international riders in 26 tuk tuks raise more than US $ 250,000 for local charities across the country.??
Commenting on the journey, Watson said, ?I feel extremely privileged to have been able to take part in this challenge, which has given me tremendous insight into the local communities across this beautiful country and the opportunity to give back by fundraising along the way.?
?Undoubtedly, Sri Lanka offers one of the largest cash displacement opportunities in South Asia. Throughout the trip, we realised the ubiquity of debit cards and credit cards even across some of the more remote areas. Today, there are more than 18 million debit cards and 1.4 million credit cards in circulation, providing around 70 percent of the population with access to a digital form of payment. Combined with 126 percent mobile penetration, I believe Sri Lanka is well placed to become the first South Asian economy to truly transition into a digital economy.??
The Tuk Tuk journey, consisting of a convoy of brightly painted three-wheelers, delivered supplies and supported charity projects all the way from Chilaw to Trincomalee and Hambantota, finally winding up in Galle and Hikkaduwa before returning to Colombo.
Watson?s cashless adventure actually started in Colombo before the charity ride commenced. During this time, he spent two weeks trying to complete everyday tasks that were challenging yet fundamental to conducting an effective cashless journey. From getting a haircut at a local barber, to eating at local restaurants, shopping at markets, paying parking attendants and running errands, these were all tasks that Watson successfully paid for using his Visa card but not before some hurdles had to be overcome.?
From buying groceries to even paying the traffic warden at the Colpetty supermarket, Watson was able to understand just how many possibilities there are in the city itself for cashless payments to be made ? effectively and easily.
As the charity ride got underway, things became even more challenging. From buying fuel at a petrol station for his three-wheeler, to getting a simple dinner of hoppers and curry, Watson had to walk in search of places that would accept cashless payments.
?In the first town we drove into in the North Western Province, almost 20 local stores I visited only accepted cash. Later, in Chilaw, I found that around 75 percent of the shops deal only in cash. One shop owner told me that for them, cash is a way of life. Clearly this shows the significant potential for expanding access to cashless transactions and for greater engagement with small and medium-scale entrepreneurs and shop owners across the country,? added Watson.
From Chilaw they headed towards the East Coast, where there were smaller shops ready to accept card payments ? mostly because of the tourists who visit. From there, as they travelled down to the south and then back to Colombo, Watson was able to learn even more ? from opportunity available for cashless payments to be made as a safe, easy mode of payment to empowering local communities with more options of payment than just cash.
The insights Watson was able to pick up on the journey were many but a few stand out as noteworthy not only for the financial sector but also for Sri Lanka as a growing market with potential for the expansion of the digital economy.??
Watson believes that when it comes to understanding the benefits of cashless payments, consumer education is important.?
?People will benefit from knowing just how safe and convenient cashless payments can be. They need to know how simple and easy making a payment by card is today.??
A key insight was the ease with which the younger generation was able to connect with the digital economy. ?With their smartphones, they had access to the Internet and knew how to make online payments. They were also using the opportunity to educate the older generation of business owners on the possibilities of technology.?? ?
As the usage of smartphones and Internet grows throughout Sri Lanka, so will the willingness on the part of consumers to embrace technology.
?Various business models and apps being used are going to change the landscape for payments in Sri Lanka. There is likely to be a surge of growth in digital payments in this manner.?
Watson says that the power of kindness that he saw on his journey was an experience that touched him ? from the ex-serviceman, who volunteered to take him on the motorcycle to a petrol shed and then bring him back to his stranded three-wheeler with fuel in a bottle and refusing to be compensated for it, to the shop owners, who went that extra mile to make sure he could actually make a cashless payment ? even if it meant borrowing another shopkeeper?s POS terminal.?
?Digital transformation is bringing Sri Lankans closer to one another in the community and also to the world,? he says.?
On the whole, the journey yielded the kind of insights that Watson believes would empower the community, fintechs and the country itself ? accelerating the growth of electronic payments is very much a topic of relevance for Sri Lanka.

When you let the cavity erode your tooth
	
?
Almost everybody has experienced cavities and other aches and pains that originate from the mouth. You usually think that it?s a trivial matter and you?ll pay a visit to the dentist to have it checked. But what happens when you ignore the pain in your mouth and allow the cavity to progress deeper into your tooth? The Health Capsule spoke to Dr. Vipula Wickramasinghe, General Secretary of the Sri Lanka Dental Association and Regional Dental Surgeon of the Colombo District, in order to find out the process of a root canal treatment and the different aspects of it.? ?
?
Definition?
Defining a root canal treatment Dr. Wickramasinghe said,?There are certain cases that we receive which are beyond normal fillings. What has happened is that the cavity has gone up to the pulp chamber. Then you have only two options; either to extract the tooth or do a root canal treatment. The root canal is when you treat all the canals of the tooth. Certain teeth have single canals, certain teeth have two canals, Some may have three or four. So we prescribe treatment to all these canals and make the tooth intact in the mouth. It will be in the mouth, but it is a dead tooth,? he said.
?
Signs that you need treatment? ?
Speaking on how the decision to perform the procedure is made he said,?There are certain patients that come with pain and there is no swelling. But when you examine carefully, you can see that the pulp is exposed in the cavity that?s formed in the tooth. Then you have to go for root canal treatment. In certain cases regarding the teeth, the tooth becomes a blackish colour without the patient?s knowledge. This may be due to a trauma that was experienced many years ago. with regard to certain cases you don?t have any pain, but there?s a cavity with an almost dead tooth in the mouth. But still if you feel the pulp protrudes you have to go for the root canal treatment,?Dr. Wickramasinghe said.?
?The cardinal rule is that you have to have an X Ray before a decision can be made whether you need to go for a root canal or not. Otherwise, if there is a colour change in the tooth you have to do a vitality test. In this test the doctor will get to check the vitality or the liveliness of the tooth. There are special gadgets called pulp testers and if the vitality is lost you have to go for the root canal treatment,? he continued.? ?
?
Infection?
When there is decay in the tooth the condition develops through the enamel, then the dentin and then it progresses into the pulp. As the pulp is exposed to the bacteria it will get infected. Sometimes you get severe pain due to pulpitis, which is infected pulp, which is called acute pulpitis. Sometimes you don?t experience pain, although the pulp that is exposed is infected. This is called chronic pulpitis. But if you talk to the patient the patient will say that around 3/4 months ago, he or she had a slight pain on that tooth. Thus the medical history of the patient is important.
?
Procedure? ?
Explaining the procedure Dr. Wickramasinghe said that there are four steps to be followed. ?The first step is to make an access cavity to go into the root canal. The second step is obturation, which is that you have to remove all the pulp debris, all the infected particles from that particular root canal. The third one is irrigation, which is very important. When you are obturating you have to continuously irrigate the canal with different solutions, which are manufactured for this particular purpose. Obturation and irrigation happen simultaneously during the procedure. And finally you fill the canal with material which is bio compatible, but doesn?t react with the human body tissue. You have to fill the total canal, so there shouldn?t be any gaps or any leakages after the filling,? explained Dr. Wickramasinghe.?
?Since treatment is always under local anesthesia, there is no pain during the procedure. Normally antibiotics will be administered for the infected teeth. Sometimes you may experience slight pain during the course of the treatment. It isn?t a single visit treatment. Generally treatments is complete after two visits. But in certain instances, such as emergencies, we do one visit root canals,? he added.? ?
What to expect?
Dr. Wickramasinghe went on to explain why a root canal procedure is decided upon.?Normally patients want to retain the tooth in the mouth and not get it extracted, so the only option is to do a root canal. This is possible if the tooth has gone beyond normal fillings. When patients come to us the top half of the tooth has gone and the patient wants to have the original tooth restored,? he said.? ?
Explaining what comes after a root canal he said, ?After we do the treatment we put what is called the crown. It is an artificial cover of a tooth, which is manufactured according to the patient?s original tooth. It is made with different materials. We have metal, porcelain and zirconia. This is a different procedure following the root canal. Before the root canal you have to explain to the patient that once you do the root canal the tooth dies and there is a higher tendency for it to become more brittle, so the top part of the tooth can break at any time, which is why you have to put a crown on top of the tooth to strengthen it. That provides the tooth with the strength as well as an aesthetic aspect,?he explained.?
?
Complications? ?
Explaining the complications that could take place, Dr. Wickramasinghe said, ?If the infection is very strong then you can?t get rid of it because every time you try to obturate or irrigate the infection still remains, In such cases the procedure takes time. Sometimes there is unstoppable bleeding from the canal.? It is difficult to control the bleeding if the patient is taking aspirin or some kind of drugs or there is thinning of the blood. This is because the canal has small blood vessels. It is not that the patient can?t undergo a root canal treatment, but it takes a little time,?he said.?
?Sometimes, without any reason, patients experience continuous pain. If the patient has periodontal or gum diseases it?s a little difficult to administer the root canal treatment because the infection is so high. Sometimes there are certain operative factors as well. A basic complication would be that during the procedure the patient might feel slight pain. But all these things once identified can be treated. Once you finish the root canal you have to take an X Ray and see if you have done it correctly,? the doctor continued.? ?
Furthermore Dr. Wickramasinghe stated that if you don?t feel pain five years after a root canal treatment, then the procedure was successful.? ?
?
Avoiding treatment? ?
Dr. Wickramasinghe further advised, ?Once you get a small cavity you have to go to a doctor and get it filled without leaving it to decay up to the pulp. If you can fill it from the enamel level or the dentin level you don?t have to do the root canal treatment,?he concluded.
