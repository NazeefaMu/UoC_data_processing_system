A glimpse of Anatomy: The upper limb
	

The subject of anatomy is a necessary evil when studying medicine. This is because in order for the illness to be diagnosed, you need to identify exactly where the problem lies. That is why the first and second year medical students spend hours poring over the exact pathways of the vessels and nerves, attachments and innervation of muscles and studying the smallest protrusions or indentations of the bones. The first thing they usually learn while studying about the anatomy is the anatomy of the upper limb. There are whole books penned on the upper limb, to the point that you almost wish that it wasnt so intricately evolved and being associated with so many muscles and nerves. While Im not going to scare our readers away with all the intricate details, Im hoping to give you a peep into the interesting anatomy of the upper limb. This will help you realize that there is more depth to the upper limb than you initially realized.
The upper limb is divided as the shoulder girdle, the forearm; which is the part between the shoulder and the elbow, and the arm; the part between the elbow and the wrist, and the distally situated hand. It comprises 32 bones on either side (64 bones in total). This includes the bones of the shoulder, the Clavicle and the Scapula. 
Talking about the nerves supplying the arm, ever heard of the term Brachial plexus It used to be the bane of my existence during the first year in medical school. Its an intricate weaving of nerves progressing from neck area and is situated under your arm-pits. At a glance, it looks like a bowl of over- boiled noodles sticking together, but in reality, this plexus has a lot to do with helping humans stand, since the evolution of the upper limb of the humans is said to be one big reason that we are far ahead of the other species in the animal kingdom, in some aspects, at least. And the brachial plexus enables it all, from the drawings of the Da Vinci, the music of the Mozart down to the punches of Muhammad Ali. (If you are curious as to why I called it the Bane of my existence, its because we had to identify each individual nerve in that bowl of noodles and track their journey through each nook and cranny of the upper arm.) Did you know that the funny bone that gives you a tingly sensation every time it hits something, is actually a nerve called the ulnar nerve
There are certain anatomical landmarks in the upper limb that are quite useful in the medical profession. The area on the opposite side of your elbow, where blood is usually drawn in, is an area called the cubital fossa. This is a triangular shaped area in the roof of which runs a superficial vein called the median cubital vein. Now you know how the lobotomist (usually) knows how to draw blood from the first attempt. Theres another interesting landmark called the anatomical snuffbox, because apparently its the place where old people used to place and snuff tobacco at. The importance of this land mark is to diagnose a fracture of the scaphoid; one of the carpal bones. In this case the patient feels tenderness inside the snuffbox. 
I hope I piqued your interest from the little information I presented you with on a subject as vast as the ocean itself. Human Anatomy, or the study of the architecture of the human body, is an extremely complex subject, but it also has the ability to amaze you with its precision and intricacy, when you do a careful study of it.

Arthur C. Clarke Centre calls for asteroid footages
	
The Arthur C. Clarke Centre yesterday requested the general public to handover original video footage or images of the asteroid, which entered the earths atmosphere Wednesday night for its observations.
Speaking to the Daily Mirror, the Centre's senior research scientist Saroj Gunasekera said that the Centre could come to a determination only after receiving original footages. He said that they had to determine the entry point of the asteroid.
After making calculations, we can come to a decision of the asteroid as to how long it burns in the sky, and which direction it has come from, he said.
He said that one could find if the asteroid was listed under the Potentially Hazardous Asteroids (PHAs) database listed by NASA, Gunasekera said.
According to the spaceweather.com website, there are 1847 Potentially Hazardous Asteroids.
Though the recent asteroid is listed in the PHAs, it can change its direction. There are four more PHAs according to the list, he said.
According to the website, 168-metre diameter asteroid is to pass the earth at a distance of 19.9 Lunar Distance (1 LD = 384,401 km) at a velocity of 19.2km/s.
Colombo University Physical Science Department Prof. Chandana Jayaratne yesterday confirmed that the bright light and sound heard in the Southern Province (SP) on Wednesday evening was because of an explosion caused by a meteorite. (Chaturanga Pradeep)

Attack on Rohingya refugees: Absconding monk arrested
	
The Ven. Arambepola Rathanasara Thera who is wanted in connection with the Mount Lavinia attack on 31 Rohingya refugees was arrested today at Nittambuwa by a special team of police personnel.
Police spokesman Ruwan Gunasekara said the monk in a bus travelling from Kandy to Colombo when he was arrested on the direction of IGP Pujith Jayasundara after he received information as to the whereabouts of the monk.
The police recovered two NIC's which were in the monk's possession. One of NICs had been issued at the time he was a layman.
The Colombo Crimes Division (CCD) had earlier sought public assistance to locate the monk's whereabouts after he had gone into hiding soon after the mindless attack on the helpless refugees. SP Gunasekara said the monk was evading the arrest for nearly a month.
He said the Thera would be handed over to the CCD for further investigations and that action would be taken against who had helped the monk to evade arrest.
On an earlier occasion, the CCD arrested Ven. Akmeemana Dayarathana Thera and seven others including a woman and a police constable in connection with the Mount Lavinia attack. Dayarathana Thera and five others were granted bail while two others were remanded till October 30. (Darshana Sanjeewa)

CPC prevented from taking over 16 Trinco tanks: COPE report
	
A Cabinet decision to take over 16 tanks from the Trincomalee Oil Tank farm has not been carried out as the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) have been prevented from taking them over, the report of parliamentary committee on Public Accounts ( COPE) which was presented to Parliament said yesterday.
The report submitted by COPE Chairman Sunil Handunetti to the House said the CPC officials who visited the tank farm had been prevented from entering it by certain forces despite a prior notice given to Indian Oil Company officials. Meanwhile the report said losses from the hedging deal which was originally thought to be Rs 10 billion had now arisen to Rs 14 billion in 2016.
The Tourism Development Authority had paid Rs 7,382,305 as a part of the interest of a loan of Rs 100 million issued to a private hotel by the Bank of Ceylon in 2014, the report notes. The COPE has found that a sum of Rs 11,089,228 out of Rs 29,195,802 that had been allocated to renovate 30 rooms of a holiday bungalow belonging to the Authority had been drawn without any work done. A sum of Rs 10,196,000 had been paid to a supplier of stones without approval. A sum of Rs 3,226,950 had been paid to suppliers by authority without adhering to the regulations. Even though the kalpitiya intergrated tourism project commenced in 2008 on an estimated cost of Rs 5521 million to construct holiday resorts with 4,000 rooms and infrastructure facilities and the work was to be completed in five years, not a single room had been constructed despite an expenditure of Rs 88,797,590 as at Dec 31, 2014.
The Mattala International Airport had been running at a net loss of Rs. 2,105,298,382 in 2013, Rs 2,729,201,680 in 2014, Rs 3,099,230,580 in 2015 and Rs 1,546,931,328 in 2016. It has been revealed that seven foreign institutions have sent proposals to develop the the airport. These include Sakurai Aviation TLD, omega global with Claymore Hill Advisory and Aviation Resource Group International, Care Aviation Ltd and Diesel and Motor Engineering PLC and Sierra Networks Put Ltd.
The CWE had incurred a loss of Rs 39 million in 2014 by purchasing 14,000 carrom boards and 11,000 draughts boards. The CWE has received only Rs 257,667,217 of Rs 870,963,097 given to the Lanka Sathosa.
An amount of Rs 260 million given as loans by the Peoples Bank to a customer had been written off in 2011, the COPE report said adding that the amount was 51 percent of loans written off by the bank during that year as non performing loans.
The Sri Lanka Ayurvedic Drugs Corporation spent Rs seven million as an initial step to introduce ten new products to the market during a ceremony by the name of Isiwara Osu launch in 2015. Out of the expenditure borne on this event, 71 per cent had been spent on publicity. Out of the ten products only one was new and other nine were old products as per the report.

Eczema The itchy rash on your skin
	

Eczema is a medical condition where inflammation and redness occurs in the outermost layer of the skin. It is also known as dermatitis. Speaking to Dr. Nayani Madarasinghe, Consultant Dermatologist, the Health Capsule learned that although eczema isnt a curable medical condition it can be managed with proper treatment and isnt a contagious disease. Dr. Madarasinghe further emphasized about the different types of eczema, the symptoms, causes and how it should be treated and prevented.

Types
According to Dr. Madarasinghe there are several types of eczema. She first went on to explain the most common type. One is atopic eczema, which usually occurs in children. It usually starts at round three to four months and then most of the time children come off it when they are ten to twelve years of age. This would be hereditary. And it could also be associated with asthma, psynitis, wheezing and hay fever.she said.
Speaking of contact dermatitis or contact eczema she said, This has two types which are, irritant contact dermatitis and allergic contact dermatitis. Irritant contact dermatitis is usually due to the solvents, water, harsh soaps, alkaline, due to direct damage to the skin. Allergic contact dermatitis is due to the repeated exposure of the skin; the skin gets unsensitized and then develops the allergic type of dermatitis. The common allergic reactions are to cement, hair dyes, rubbers etc, explained Dr. Madarasinghe.
Moving on to the other types, Dr Madarasinghe said, Then you have another type which is only limited to the hand, which is known as hand dermatitis. There is another type known discoid eczema. The cause for this is unknown, but the name was given due to its shape. They usually develop in the form of a circle. Then you have one known as stasis dermatitis. This is usually associated with varicose veins. So the eczema occurs in the inner part of the lower limb. Then you have the seborrheic eczema, which is common where the oil producing glands are, which is usually on the scalp or in the arm pits and can cause flaky skin. These are a few of the common types, she said. 


Symptoms
Moving on to the symptoms, Dr Madarasinghe said, Usually the main symptoms are itching, skin redness and the inflaming of the skin. When the conditions is acute there can be oozing, blisters and bleeding. And when it is in the chronic stage the skin would be very dry rough, thickened,she explained.
She further explained that there are certain people who can be prone to eczema, Regarding the elderly, dry skin can make them develop eczemas. The symptom of dry skin is very important. So if you are genetically born with a lot of dry skin you should be very careful and apply moisturizer. If you have other atopic diseases or a family history regarding this condition then you can be prone to eczema,said Dr. Madarasinghe.
Dr. Madarasinghe further said that complications can occur when the disease is left untreated. As a complication bacterial infection can occur, on top of eczema, and the skin barrier is damaged,she warned.

Cause
Speaking on the causes of eczema she said, There are different causes for eczema. Some could be hereditary. In some the environmental factors can be the cause. There are times when you wouldnt be able to find a cause because it just happens,said Dr. Madarasinghe.

Treatment and prevention
Dr. Madarasinghe further went on to talk about the treatment that is necessary to control the condition. 
The treatment would depend on the type of eczema. If you take the atopic dermatitis in children, there are a lot of moisturizers and soap substitutes. If it is associated with varicose veins, treating the underlying cause is important. If it is due to contact, avoiding that contact is very important. Likewise treatment will vary depending on the type of eczema. And for all eczemas, of any type, drug wise, the use of moisturizers, topical steroids or other oral medications should be prescribed depending on the severity of the condition,she said.
Dr. Madarasinghe further said that its very important to prevent dry skin. There is no cure for eczema and it can return. There can be relapses and remissions of the condition and it should be treated and managed properly,she concluded.

Educational Facilities during the conflict: HRW makes submission to UN
	
The New York-based Human Rights Watch has made a submission to the 77th Working Group of the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child focusing on the use of educational facilities by the military during the armed conflict in Sri Lanka.
This submission relates to Articles 28 and 38 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, and focuses on the protection of students, teachers, and schools during armed conflict.
In its 2010 Concluding Observations under the Optional Protocol on the involvement of children in armed conflict, this Committee called upon Sri Lanka to:
a) Immediately discontinue military occupation and use of the schools and strictly ensure compliance with humanitarian law and the principle of distinction and to cease utilizing the primary section of V/Tamil MV school and the Omanthai Central College in Vavuniya to host separatees; and
(b) Ensure that school infrastructures damaged as a result of military occupation are promptly and fully restored.[1]
As of August 2017, Sri Lanka was contributing 456 troops and 21 military experts to United Nations peacekeeping operations around the world. Sri Lankas peacekeeping troops are deployed in the Central African Republic, Lebanon, and South Sudan. All three of these countries have endorsed the Safe Schools Declaration, an inter-governmental political commitment that provides countries the opportunity to express political support for the protection of students, teachers, and schools during times of armed conflict; the importance of the continuation of education during armed conflict; and the implementation of the Guidelines for Protecting Schools and Universities from Military Use during Armed Conflict. As of October 2017, 69 countries have endorsed the Safe Schools Declaration, but not Sri Lanka.
Sri Lankas troops deployed on peacekeeping missions are required to comply with the United Nations Department of Peacekeeping Operations UN Infantry Battalion Manual (2012), which includes the provision that schools shall not be used by the military in their operations.[2]
Moreover, the new 2017 Child Protection Policy of the United Nations Department of Peacekeeping Operations, Department of Field Support, and Department of Political Affairs also notes:
United Nations peace operations should refrain from all actions that impede children's access to education, including the use of school premises. This applies particularly to uniformed personnel. Furthermore, recognizing the adverse impact of the use of schools for military purposes, in particular its effects on the safety of children and education personnel, the civilian nature of schools, and the right to education, United Nations peace operations personnel shall at no time and for no amount of time use schools for military purposes.[3]
Earlier, in June 2015, the United Nations Security Council unanimously adopted resolution 2225 (2015) on children and armed conflict, which:
Expresses deep concern that the military use of schools in contravention of applicable international law may render schools legitimate targets of attack, thus endangering the safety of children and in this regard encourages Member States to take concrete measures to deter such use of schools by armed forces and armed groups.[4]
Human Rights Watch recommends to the Committee that it ask the government of Sri Lanka:
-On what date did the military use of the primary section of V/Tamil MV school and the Omanthai Central College in Vavuniya cease
-On what date were restoration efforts completed to restore damage caused by the military use of the primary section of V/Tamil MV school and the Omanthai Central College in Vavuniya
-On what date were students able to commence studies at the primary section of V/Tamil MV school and the Omanthai Central College in Vavuniya, following their use for military purposes
-Are any schools, anywhere in the country, currently being used, held, or occupied for military purposes
-What steps has Sri Lanka taken in line with UN Security Council Resolution 2143 (2014) and 2225 (2015) to deter the use of schools for military purposes
-Are protections for schools from military use included in any policies, rules, or pre-deployment trainings for Sri Lankas armed forces
Human Rights Watch asks the Committee to:
Congratulate Sri Lanka for attending the Buenos Aires Safe Schools Conference in March 2017.
Call upon the government of Sri Lanka to endorse the Safe Schools Declaration, and take concrete measures to deter the military use of schools, including by bringing the Guidelines for Protecting Schools and Universities from Military Use during Armed Conflict into domestic military policy and operational frameworks.

## Title: Get your protein intake right

Get your protein intake right
	

Proteins are an essential component of a balanced diet. Proteins play a vital role in maintaining a healthy life. Dr. Kosala Karunaratna, Consultant Paediatrician of the Lady Ridgeway Hospital, Colombo, in this issue of Health Capsule discusses the significance of proteins with regard to our health.

Major food nutrients
Proteins are major food nutrients that form an essential part of a balanced diet, stated Dr. Karunaratna. Proteins are large bio-molecules. They comprise one or more chains of small units. These small units are the building blocks of proteins. These units are known as amino acids. 

Importance 
Proteins are essential for the growth of the body. They help in the repair of body cells and tissues. Proteins are essential for the synthesis of enzymes, hormones, plasma proteins and antibodies, explained Dr. Karunaratna. Carbohydrates are generally considered as energy providers. Proteins provide energy in the absence of carbohydrate in the diet. When proteins are consumed in excess, they are subjected to a process known as deamination. This occurs in the liver. Products of this reaction can be utilized to yield energy. The excess of proteins can also be used to synthesize fats.
Proteins play structural roles in our body. For instance our hair and nails comprise a protein known as keratin. Collagen is a protein which is an essential component of muscles, bones, skin, blood vessels of our body. Dr. Karunaratna stated that our DNA also consists of proteins. Haemoglobin found in our red blood cells is again a protein which helps the transportation of oxygen and carbondioxide throughout our body. Antibodies, also known as immunoglobulins, are proteins too. Enzymes and hormones in our body consists of proteins as well. Insulin is one such example for a protein hormone.
(Proteins may not always be a good thing. Venom of poisonous snakes are a type of protein too!)
Classification
Proteins arent merely obtained from the diet. Since proteins are a very important component in most parts of the body with various functions, they are synthesized within the body too. 20 different amino acids are needed by the body for the synthesis of proteins. Some amino acids are synthesized by the body. They are known as non-essential amino acids.These are synthesized by the liver. Some amino acids cant be synthesized by the body. These should be taken with the diet. They are known as essential amino acids.
Based on the amino acid content, proteins can be classified as first class proteins and second class proteins. First class proteins are protein foods that contain all the essential amino acids in the right proportions to maintain a healthy body. First class proteins are mostly obtained from animal based sources. This includes animal liver, kidney, fish, meat, eggs and milk. Soy beans provide proteins as well. Eggs contain the highest quality of protein, the paediatrician said.
The protein foods which do not contain all the essential amino acids in the right proportions are known as second class proteins. They are obtained from plant sources. This includes legumes and lentils. Peas, beans, green gram and dhal are also among the list, notified Dr. Karunaratna.
As most first class proteins come from animal sources of food, vegetarians have to make sure that they include a variety of proteins to fulfill their amino acid requirements.

Deficiency
The Dietary Reference Intake (DRI) for protein is 0.8 g per kg of body weight. This calls for around a daily protein intake of 56g for men and 46g for women on average. When adequate amounts of protein arent obtained, health issues may arise. The most common deficiency issue is malnutrition, warned Dr. Karunaratna. Kwashiorkor is a severe type of malnutrition caused by lack of protein. Marusmus is another complication that arises due to lack of calories.

Overload
While protein deficiencies can create medical complications such as malnutrition, substantially excessive amounts of protein could have adverse effects on health as well. As it was previously mentioned, when proteins are consumed in excess, they are broken down by the liver to produce energy. Though not common, when proteins are consumed in abnormally high amounts, several issues may arise. They could create or aggravate disease conditions. These include heart problems, diabetes, osteoporosis, reduced kidney function, kidney stones and constipation. A high protein intake may even result in a cancers.
If a patient suffers from liver failure and problems associated with this organ, their bodies may find it hard to breakdown protein. This could lead to health issues too due to the accumulation of proteins, expressed Dr. Karunaratna.

Girl thrown out of school after falsely being accused of getting pregnant
	
A schoolgirl, studying in grade ten of a government school in the Kekirawa Educational Zone, who had vomited in the class room after coming to school on an empty stomach, was said to have been falsely accused of being pregnant by the school principal who then threw her out of school.
The student, who comes from a very poor family, is sometimes forced to attend school on an empty stomach as there is nothing for her to eat at home. On one such day she had felt faintish and had vomited. This was noticed by her classmates who immediately assumed that she was pregnant and had brought this to the notice of the school principal. Without making any inquiries of her own the school principal had taken a hasty decision to throw her out of school after informing her parents that their daughter was pregnant.
The school girls parents, having reservations about the assumption made by the school principal, had borrowed Rs 500 and taken their child to the Dambulla Base Hospital, where she was examined by two doctors, an Obstetrician and a Gynaecologist, who informed the girl's parents that she was not pregnant. They also reported that she had not been a victim of abuse or rape. The hospital authorities had proceeded to inform the Child and Women's Bureau of the fact.
The schoolgirl continues to remain in hospital on the instructions of the director of the hospital for her to get over the mental trauma she had undergone.
When attempts were made by the paper to obtain a statement from the school authorities with regard to what had taken place, the school principal had stated over the phone that the student's behaviour had not been satisfactory and therefore they had taken a decision to expel her from the school. She had also said that past records had revealed that there had been acts of misconduct on her part in the past as well and that her parents had removed her from the school as a result.

Govt's traditional approach to debt management needs to change: PM
	
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, in his pre-budget economic policy statement to Parliament, said the governments traditional approach to debt management would have to change to cope with new risks and structural and regulatory changes.
He said the government had to face many other challenges in 2018 and 2019 in terms of public debt management and fiscal consolidation.
The domestic debt portfolio mainly consists of Treasury Bonds. Around 30% of the Treasury Bonds will mature by 2019. Similarly, Sri Lanka Development Bonds, which is a US dollar- denominated domestic debt instrument worth of more than US$2.3 billion maturing by 2018. In addition, the composition of the foreign debt portfolio has also changed considerably. This change occurred mainly due to the increased mobilization of commercial loans such as the issuance of International Sovereign Bonds. We have to pay US$1.5 billion in 2019 for maturing International Sovereign Bonds. Further we have to pay annually thereafter.
"When considering public debt servicing based on the outstanding debt as at end of August 2017, we have to pay Rs.1,974 billion in 2018. We will have to pay Rs.1,515 billion in 2019. It means we have to pay more than Rs.3,489 billion in 2018 and 2019 for debt servicing.
"Our policies will target forward-looking liability management strategies. Accordingly, the funds required by the government will be raised with transparency and predictability. Under the medium  term debt management strategy, the detailed strategies of government borrowings will be known in advance to the domestic and foreign debt portfolios. In addition, we will introduce a comprehensive secondary market trading platform and a liability management fund. These reforms and future reforms will come into effect under the new Fiscal Liability Management Act that provides legal framework for a prudent debt management strategy.
"As for maintaining low inflation, he said the government would provide the space to the Central Bank to carry out its monetary policy independently and maintain price stability on a sustainable basis.
The Central Bank is moving towards a new monetary policy framework targeting a flexible inflation. The aim of this framework is to maintain a low inflation continuously while supporting the economic activities. With this change of policy, our people will get the opportunity to live comfortably with the security of stable prices," he said.
Referring to the three-year Economic Delivery Programme, he said the government intended to raise per capita income to US$5000 a year, to create one million new jobs and to increase Foreign Direct Investment to US$5 billion a year.
The Prime Minister stressed the need to strengthen private-public-partnerships.
"We hope to harness the power and energy of PPPs to improve efficiency and agricultural productivity. The agriculture sector is saddled with major issues such as low productivity, lack of diversification, inefficiency in water management, and poor management of weather disruptions. Weaknesses in the sector contribute to food insecurity and regional poverty. We will revitalise this sector through investments in agricultural research, extension services, water resources, and infrastructure facilities. We will facilitate the shift from traditional low value to modern high value agriculture. We will encourage scientific farming, promote agro-based industries and initiate commercial agriculture with the participation of farmer organisations and the private sector" he said in this regard," the Prime Minister said.
He said a liability management fund and a liability management bill would be introduced while a national housing policy was being drafted.
"We will improve the domestic supply chains and distribution networks to do so. In the meantime, we will allow importing of food products and other essential commodities at reasonable costs within the competitive market framework" he added elaborating on the steps government will take in order to control inflation, the Prime Minister said.
He told Parliament the government would introduce a pension scheme for those who were working in informal sectors of the economy.
"A number of projects which accelerate our journey towards a stronger economy are being implemented. We are building a well-planned expressway system from Hambanthota to Kandy. We have obtained funds for that. We started a joint venture in Hambanthota Port this year. Discussions are being held to start a joint venture in Mattala Airport as well. We have started working on Hambanthota economic zone. Millaniya Trade Zone has been planned already. Wayamba Industrial Zone has also been planned. The constructions of those zones will commence next year. This is a very challenging journey towards prosperity. This is a plan to enrich the country by 2025. This is an effort to make Sri Lanka again, the economy and trade hub of the Indian Ocean. I urge all of you to join hands with me in this challenging journey towards the prosperity of our motherland," the Prime Minister said. (Yohan Perera and Ajith Siriwardane)

He donated his own land to house displaced persons in Aranayake
	
It is everybodys dream to live in a house of his own. There are many who believe that realization of this dream rests with ones own destiny. At a time when there are so many who spend their entire life to realize their dream of owning a house, an individual has stepped forward to donate a portion of the small land he had purchased through his meagre earnings.
Sometime back many were moved and in anguish in the aftermath of the severe landslide that occurred in Aranayake in the Samasara mountain. Many lives and belongings were buried under the mounds of earth that slide down the hill. The screams of those affected were heard all over, and the stories of those who lost their lives and dwellings had spread all over the country. The shocking disaster aroused the feelings of one individual who rose to the occasion and declared that he could help some of the destitute families in finding new homes. He is Edirisinghe Mudiyanselage Kapuru Banda a resident of Padeniya, Wariyapola.
The shocking disaster aroused the feelings of one individual who rose to the occasion and declared that he could help some of the destitute families in finding new homes
He was prepared to donate a land belonging to him to put up houses to accommodate the displaced persons of Aranayake. Accompanied by the Padeniya Rajamahaviharadhipathy Ven. Katumulle Sumanarathne Thera he met the Wariyapola Divisional Secretary and presented his idea, and as an initial step the proposed land was first vested with the State.
However, only one family from among the displaced families of Aranayaka was willing to reside in the land Kapuru Banda so willingly donated. Later a decision was taken to distribute the land among 14 families selected from Wariyapola at 15 perches each. The National Housing Authority agreed to provide them with a loan facility to construct the houses, but as the families were not earning a regular income the settlement of such loans was an issue. The difficulty in repaying such loans was pointed out by Kapuru Banda and several others and it was finally agreed to give Rs 500,000 each to the families to construct the houses.
Kapuru Banda the philanthropist lives in a remote area in Padeniya. He is an ideal personality depicting the true villager. He is the father of two daughters. The eldest is twenty three years of age, while the younger daughter is thirteen years old and a student. They are really village folk living a simple village life. Interviewing him and asking him about this noble gesture in donating a land for poor village families, revealed that they are ordinary village folk, believing in the value of sharing with those who are in need.
QWhat made you decide in making this donation
We were sorting out Betel leaves that were plucked from our home plot, when we saw the tragedy on TV about the landslide in Aranayake. We witnessed the cries and suffering of all those poor families who were worse affected. Whenever a tragedy of this nature strikes it is the same story of collecting aid to help the families. I was terribly moved. The first thing that occurred to my mind was to give them some land of my own for them to put up houses to stay. I am now fifty seven years old and only few more years to live. I posed this matter first to my wife. She agreed with me. We always help others in need as far as possible. I gave them three acres and now I have two and half acres left and I think my two daughters would be content with that. This land was not inherited by me, but bought with my earnings and therefore I am very happy now.
QAre you happy with the progress made in this regard
Yes, very much. Most of the work of the houses are over. There are issues connected with, provision of water, electricity and roads. I have spoken to the authorities regarding these but there appears to be slow progress.
QWhat sort of employment you are now engaged in
I am a Mason and also attend to other jobs as well. I do painting of houses. What I earn is quite sufficient to live. I will be happy if my elder daughter gets employed. She is applying to obtain suitable employment.
QWhat are your future hopes
I had a desire of performing a meritorious act. I donated this land to invoke blessings on my deceased parents. Now a small Udagama is coming up here. I wish to name it Punchimenik Village. My fathers name was Punchi Banda and mothers name Bandimenika.
Kapuru Bandas wife W. M. Sandhya Kumari when inquired about the husbands gift towards poor families, she replied that on hearing about the suffering and the catastrophe that struck Aranayake they all agreed to donate this land.
Their eldest daughter Ireshika Dimuthu Kumari said that she had her initial education at Padeniya Sunanda Maha Vidyalaya and later entered Holy Family Girls College Kurunegala to do her A/L studies. She had done Languages as a subject for A/Levels. She said she wants to get employed in order to assist the family. She also confirmed that her father likes to help everyone who is in need of help.
Thirteen year old younger daughter of Kapuru Banda studies at Sunanda Madhya Maha Vidyalaya Padeniya. 
A visit to the land where houses are now coming up, and meeting those who are preparing to occupy them was much thought provoking.
I am a Mason and also attend to other jobs as well. I do painting of houses. What I earn is quite sufficient to live. I will be happy if my elder daughter gets employed. She is applying to obtain suitable employment
S.M. Podimenike who was terribly moved with the gift of a land and house that their family is about to move in said she and her daughter had been sleeping in a wayside boutique exposed to the elements and after several visits to the Kurunegala Housing Department and meeting Kapuru Banda they are now getting a house of their own. She said that her family is ever grateful to Kapuru Banda for this magnanimous gesture. There several others who extended their heartfelt thanks to Kapuru Banda.
Now that Kapuru Banda has provided the land and also assisted in building the houses there are other needs such as water, electricity and roads for this housing complex to be called as another reawakening village.

HNB announces reduced rates on personal finance products
	
In a continuing effort to partner its clients and support them to achieve their aspirations, Sri Lankas leading retail bank, HNB PLC, announced that it would be reducing interest rates on all of its core personal financial products  spanning leasing, housing and personal loans.
Over the recent past we have witnessed significant demand for loans, particularly in the demographic of young professionals, many of who are seeking to buy a car, start a home, for professional studies or for any other investment activity, as these are important landmarks in our customers lives and we want to do our part to make them a reality. At HNB we are committed in supporting our clients to achieve their dreams, and serve as a true partner in their journey to greater prosperity. Hence, when we saw an opportunity to pass on the benefits of current macroeconomic conditions to our customers we decided to move quickly to ensure that all of our customers gain from current market dynamics, HNB Personal Financial Services Head Viraj Mendis said.
The bank currently offers up to 70 percent of the total market value as a loan on registered vehicles and 50 percent of the market value on new vehicles. Following the rate cut, interest rates on Personal Financial Service products will start as low as from 13.25 percent for professional category, for housing purposes.
He added that Sri Lankas increasing affluence was also beginning to be demonstrated through increased demand for personal loans aimed at funding education and international travel, which the rate cut from HNB, is ideally timed to facilitate.
At this time of the year, many foreign universities start to open up applications; hence we tend to receive even greater applications for education loans. Similarly, travel loans also tend to spike towards the end of the year, with travel companies often offering discounts for pre-booking targeting the first and second quarters of 2018, Viraj Mendis explained.
He further noted that HNB will continue to offer these loans on fixed or floating rates, depending on the requirements and preference of each customer while further discounts and special rates would be rolled out to customers in the coming months as part of the banks festive season campaigns. Further discounts are also available to HNBs Shanthi Housing Loyalty Cardholders from over 60+ selected merchants.

## Title: How to tackle constipation

How to tackle constipation
	

Every single person at one time or another have experienced the uncomfortable condition called constipation. Constipation is especially a frequent complaint among elders. In addition, this condition is becoming increasingly common among the younger population due to the sedentary lifestyle most of them are leading. Constipation is preventable and can be treated with lifestyle changes. In addition this condition can also be a warning sign for a more sinister underlying cause, in rare cases. 
Although constipation is medically defined as having less than three bowel movements per week, it depends on the individual. Usually, symptoms of constipation is when a person has infrequent bowel motions and hard stools which are difficult to pass.

How and why
From the moment food enters the mouth, digestion begins. When it reaches the colon, most of it has been digested and many nutrients absorbed into the body. The function of the colon is to absorb water and minerals and propel stools towards the rectum where its dispelled through the anus. All these are done involuntarily, meaning that you cant consciously control the functions of your intestines. But since we usually have control over the external anal sphincter, its possible to hold on until the right time. 
So, constipation is usually a result of a disturbance during this mechanism. Low fiber diet, Poor hydration and lack of exercise result in reduced gut motility and problems in the nervous system which results in reduced movements and inherent problems in the gastrointestinal(GI) tract. These are some of the causes for constipation. But usually constipation doesnt have a single cause and can be the result of an overlapping of multiple causes.
For the convenience of diagnosis and treatment, constipation is categorized as acute and chronic. Acute constipation is the sudden onset absence of bowel movement, while chronic constipation is constipation lasting over a long period of time. Both conditions may share similar causes, but there are times when some of the causes may belong to only one category. 
Acute constipation may be due to a recent change in lifestyle, like a new drug that you are taking. Some anti hypertensive drugs, antidepressants and anti psychotics, iron and calcium supplements and narcotic pain medications are known to cause constipation as a side effect. Usually, a person who has undergone surgery may have constipation that lasts for a few days due to the effects of anaesthesia. A person, who may have damaged her nerves, supplying the colon and the perineum, may also develop sudden constipation. Another cause may be an obstruction in the GI tract, making it difficult for stools to pass. This will require further investigations in order to diagnose the cause.
Chronic constipation may be due to various causes; long standing illnesses like diabetes and parkinsons, diseases in the GI tract like inflammotory Bowel Disease or Cystic Fibrosis. In older people this condition may be a result of several contributing factors including disease conditions, medication and reduced bowel motility. Chronic constipation, though it may not lead to serious outcomes, nevertheless causes serious morbidity in the areas of his or her social and psycological well-being. 

Prevention
Eating fiber-rich food, which aids in increasing the bulk of the stool, makes it easier to pass bowel. Add grams, fruits and vegetables, which have plenty of fibre, to your diet. Avoid fast foods which contain refined ingredients and no fibre. Such foods trigger constipation in addition to their numerous other ill effects.
Drink plenty of water. Do not postpone the urge to defecate because the more time stool is stored in the large intestine, the more water it absorbs back into the body, making stool hard and difficult to expel. 
A sedentary lifestyle is a causative factor for constipation. Therefore get adequate exercise regularly. 
If your constipation is associated with any recent changes to your lifestyle, like a new medication, mention it to your doctor, so that he can either change the medication or prescribe an alternative medication to counteract it.

Complications
People with constipation are prone to straining while defecating which gives rise to complications like haemorrhoids , which results in painless bleeding. They are also at an increased risk of developing anal fissures, which is associated with very painful defecation. This condition makes the patient reluctant to defecate, making the condition even worse.
Chronic constipation may also lead to a condition called rectal prolapse, which is a part of the rectum protruding out from the anus. Another possible complication is the fecal impaction which is a hard bulk of stool blocking the rectum. This may result in the condition called over-flow incontinence, which is liquid matter leaking out from around the bulky mass, staining the clothes. This can be very embarassing for the patient. 
Even more than the complications, what we must be alert to with regard to constipation, especially in acute cases, is the possibility of other underlying causes which give rise to constipation in the first place. The first thing to exclude is colon cancer, which could obstruct the colon and cause constipation. Other causes like Hypothyroidism and depression also lead to constipation.


When to seek treatment
Seek a doctor immediately if you have sudden constipation associated with bloating, vomitting and inability to pass gas, which may be the result of bowel obstruction. In this case, dont give the patient anything to eat or drink orally since he may need to undergo surgery.

Treatment
Treatment varies according to the cause and factors associated with the patient. Some may simply need a change in lifestyle while others may need laxatives. Laxatives can either be bulk forming agents or stimulants. Bulk forming agents usually draw water into the intestine and soften the stool, while stimulants increase the contractions of the stomach. Even though over the counter laxatives are freely available in pharmacies, using laxatives for a long time, without consulting a doctor, is not advisable because this may result in side effects. The addiction to the drug is one.

Line of Sun or Apollo  a sister to Fate line
	
Human hand  Trailblazer of Human Civilization  Part 28

The line of Apollo or Sun has no fixed point of origin nor is it found in all hands.
The Sun Line is found rising from various points in the hand. In most cases, it rises from the plain of Mars. It also rises from the Life line and Mounts of Luna and Mars. In some hands, this line ends high up on the Mount of Sun and in some other cases it does not reach the Mount.
Some well-known palmists say that the Sun line should be looked on as a sister line of the Fate Line or a second line to the latter. Palmists generally agree that that the Sun line cannot exert its influence if there is no fate line.
The points of origin of the Sun line as observed by competent palmists are as follows:
1) Mount of Venus
2) Life line
3) Mount of Mars
4) Head line
5) Mount of Moon or Luna
6) The wrist (near bracelets rascettes)
7) Mount of Mercury
8) Heart line
General indications
The Sun line indicates the capabilities, fame, intellect, artistic aptitudes and the financial prosperity of the subject. The length of the line determines the extent and duration of its influence. The longer the line the more effective it is.
The character of the Sun line
The clearness, depth and evenness indicate the strength of the qualities of the line.
Broad and shallow and chained lines signify the defects of the line. Breaks indicate setbacks in the career. If the line ends in a Dot, it points to loss of reputation. Ending in a star indicates brilliant success.
A deep bar or a cross terminating the line reveals an insurmountable obstacle at the close of life. The line ending in a square is favourable for it signifies the protection of the subject from all troubles indicated by the defects of the line. The line ending in a fork tells that the subject is highly talented and his skills cover many disciplines. A well-marked trident or a star ending the line tells of wealth and fame achieved through the use of talent and intellect.
Positions of the Sun line and the results they signify:
1) Sun line originating from the Mount of Venus: Financial prosperity, having several mistresses in addition to wife. The subject becomes rich after marriage.
2) The line starting from the Life line: The subjects are great artistes. They are emotional. They amass wealth through works of art.

Love at first sight cost him his monthly salary
	
A beautiful young lass accompanied her sick father to a reputed hospital in the Uva Province.
A hospital attendant who met them at the entrance, was entranced by the beauty of the young woman. Her smile and poise shown by her was very inviting and he hastened to help her father to get to the surgical unit and back with glee and was even obliging enough to get him something to eat from outside in order to get on his daughter's good books.
In due course a strong friendship developed between the young woman and the attendant. After about a week the patient was discharged from hospital. The girl thanked the attendant profusely and even offered him her phone number to contact her.
A few days later he proceeded to call his new love interest. He said "Shall I come to visit you, we can go and worship at Kataragama Having received a yes he lost no time in packing his bags and heading over to the address she had given him. Apparently it was not just she that was eager to meet the young man. Her father was also waiting to thank the man who made his time at the hospital a bearable one. After exchanging pleasantries and thanking him once again the girl's father left the two love-birds to themselves.
The young man invited his new love interest to join him to worship at the Kataragama Devale. She declined the invitation and suggested that he goes on his own. Disappointed by her coldness he spent the rest of the day walking around town without visiting the Devale and at nightfall he returned to the young womans house expecting to be asked to spend the night there. He was disappointed as she suggested that he stays at a hotel nearby. He was bemused, but having no alternative opted to occupy a room at the hotel suggested by her.He assumed that she would pick up the tab for the hotel and proceeded to enjoy the comforts of the hotel including food and drink. He attempted to call her mobile in order to continue with their 'love chat'. However, to his surprise, her phone had been disconnected.
In the morning he heard a knock on his hotel room door and expecting it to be the young woman he opened the door with much anticipation, only to be greeted by the sight of the waiter of the hotel presenting him with the bill amounting to Rs 4000. Luckily for him he had just received his pay packet and was able to settle the bill or he would have had to spend some time in jail. Cursing his bad luck he went back home heartbroken.

Migraine or headache, how do we know
	

Headache is a very common yet unpleasant term we come across in our day today conversations. The severity of it might not keep us away from our daily lifestyle. Yet some headaches can be really torturing and could make us remain in bed, doing nothing.
When suffering from these headaches, have you ever thought whether it could be something to do with Migraine- a very common term we hear at present. Is this probably due to rapid advancements of diagnosis and patient knowledge in various clinical conditions Yes, your headache can of course be a migraine, but it is always necessary to think of all the other types of headaches and their natures, before coming in to the exact diagnosis of Migraine. Through this article we are going to discuss what a headache and migraine are and how they differ from one another. Knowing this difference is highly important in deciding the modality of treatment required.

What is a headache
A headache is an unpleasant sensation in your head which can present either as pressure or an ache. The severity of it can depend on the way you can bear up pain (pain threshold) and vary from mild to severe. Commonest places for headache include, forehead, temples and back of the neck. Headaches can occur as a symptom of an underlying pathology so persistent headaches, or ones which cause a negative impact on day to day activities, should be taken in to consideration immediately and medical advice should be sought.
There are various types of headaches, based on the underlying etiology. They are as follows-
Primary

Tension headache- This is a type of headache which gives a similar sensation of an elastic band, squeezing around your head. Caused by the contraction of muscles between your head and neck, this dull pain is usually experienced across the head and can be mild to moderate in severity. An attack usually lasts for half an hour to few hours, but in severe cases this can last long for days.
	Cluster headaches-Severe and painful headaches, which usually occur in one side of the head (unilateral). Painful attacks, experienced here are usually of clusters and will be accompanied by head ache free episodes.
	Migraine headaches- A moderate to severe pain, throbbing in nature on a side of the head or in the front area. Can be associated with nausea, vomiting and blurred vision.

Secondary
These headaches usually occur as a part of an underlying illness or an injury. 
Sinus headache- This is the commonest type of secondary headache which can arise due to an underlying infection or increased pressure in sinuses.
	Medication over use headache-Long term use of certain drugs can trigger persistent headaches. These sort of headaches will usually resolve when drugs are stopped and alternatives are used. A patient presenting with an acute or chronic headache should be assessed carefully in order to establish an accurate diagnosis. In such cases, special attention should be given to numerous signs and symptoms associated such as nausea, vomiting, blurring of vision, aura, neck stiffness, fever, ear discharge etc.
Corner stone of management
-Over the counter drugs
Acetaminophen
	Ibuprofen
	Aspirin
-Relaxation techniques
Heat therapy
	Physiotherapy
	Massages
	Neck exercises with stretching

What is Migraine
Migraine is a throbbing pain usually arising in one side of the head (unilateral), triggered by specific things or situations. Accounting for a significant female predominance (75%), Migraine itself is known to make a huge negative impact on the manpower in the community.
Commonest triggering factors for migraine include,
Food such as caffeine, cheese and chocolate
	Stress
	Hormones
	Cold climates
	Waking up in the morning
	Long journeys of flights
There are two main categories of Migraine based on the presence of Aura- A vivid visual sensation experienced by individuals, 10-30 minutes before a migraine attack.

Migraine with aura 
	Migraine without aura 
	Migraine with aura are usually associated with,
	Disturbed thinking
	Visual disturbances such as flashing lights or vivid lines
	A tingling or numb sensation in hands or face
	Sensory disturbances of smell, taste or touch
Other signs and symptoms associated with migraine include,
Yawning
	Irritability
	Constipation
	Stiffness in the neck 
	Unusual food cravings

How do you treat Migraine
Prevention and staying away from triggering factors play a major role in the treatment. 
	Other interventions include,
	Pharmacotherapy and medication such as-Anti emetics, Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and Triptans.

How can you differentiate a headache from migraine
Migraine is a type of headache which usually occurs due to various triggering agents such as environment, stress, hormones, food etc. Most migraines are moderate to severe in nature when compared to headaches, where the severity would depend on the underlying cause and may vary from mild to moderate to severe. Migraine typically affects only one side of the head (unilateral), where some patients might rarely present with bilateral aches. 
As far as the quality of pain is concerned, headaches are usually intense and achy whereas migraine can be throbbing and dull, making daily activities quite difficult or impossible.

MYTH: Crossing your eyes can make them stay like that
BUSTED: Nothing will happen when you do that. When you are younger you have the ability to see very close and focus on closer objects, but gradually as we age we lose that ability. Adults might not be able to see things closely, but children can see objects close to their eyes. They can see them very clearly. That is called accommodation and with age they lose that accommodative power. When you look at your nose your pupils converge together and that converging power is very high in children.

New pedestrian  App to nudge drivers caught napping
	

If there is any assistance, equipment or even a mobile app available to reduce road accidents, especially the accidents which occur at pedestrian crossings, there is no doubt that we should use such assistance for our own safety. 
Statistics collected by the police states that road accidents have been responsible for more than 2,000 deaths between January and September. It must be noted that 681 of these accidents have taken place on pedestrian crossings. 
Police stated that many of the deaths on the pedestrian crossings take place at night due to reckless driving and the lack of safety measures taken by pedestrians, when crossing. 
We couldnt determine exactly why pedestrians are victims while they use pedestrian crossings, but many speculate that these accidents that happen during the night occur largely because drivers have become so aggressive and dont bother to stop their vehicles. It is also said that these accidents happen because drivers find it hard to detect pedestrians using the pedestrian crossings at night. 
The solution
Sankha Ratnayaka (22), a past pupil of St. Joseph College, who wihes to study computer science at the Colombo University, has invented a mobile app which offers aid in the form of a crossing assistant.

The app aims to reduce the number of deaths which occurs on pedestrian crossings. Ratnayake has also roped in IGP Pujith Jayasundara in a bid to promote the app while having the safety of the public in mind. 
The crossing assistant has the ability only to increase the safety of its user by making him or her more visible to motorists before they appear in their range of vision. The public is advised to follow all routine steps when crossing the road in addition to using the app. 
Using the app in the real world 
If you try to cross a busy road at night, the possibility of a driver not seeing the pedestrian is very high. This is because the flash of headlights, coming from vehicles used by other drivers, disturb the visibility of the drivers who have to negotiate pedestrians walking on the crossing. Its also possible that the driver wouldnt spot a pedestrian until he or she is illuminated by the light and appears in their range of vision.
But if the driver notices you before entering his lane, he will have ample time to stop the vehicle and let you cross to the other side. Thats where you need the crossing assistant. It can help you get noticed by the driver and allow you to cross the road safely.
Sankha Ratnayaka
However, the app is only available on android and windows mobile phones. 
How to use the app 
Hold the phone horizontally allowing drivers to see the blinking light which will indicate the direction the pedestrian is moving towards. 
Warning sound 
When you are crossing the road, even when the vehicles have stopped to let you pass, accident can still occur due to approaching vehicles which are unable to spot the pedestrian due to vehicles that have already stopped and blocked the view of the crossing. 
To avoid such unfortunate incidents, pedestrians can also use the warning sound, a feature in the app.

When you touch the play button on the app, it will trigger a warning sound in your app as a safety precaution, allowing the drivers to know that you are crossing. This feature will come in handy even during the day. These features will be mostly effective when pedestrians have to negotiate motorcycles and three wheelers. 
If you try to cross a busy road at night, the possibility of a driver not seeing the pedestrian is very high. This is because the flash of headlights, coming from vehicles used by other drivers, disturb the visibility of the drivers who have to negotiate pedestrians walking on the crossing
Other features
The screen will switch off while the app is in operation and the brightness of the display screen will be maximized temporarily (only on android). The warning sound volume can be adjusted using your mobile phones volume rocket. 
Inventors vision
Speaking at a press briefing held recently, Rathnayake said that the app wasnt a pass given to pedestrians to cross the road irresponsibly. 
This is something which will make the pedestrian visible to drivers during night. That means they must still follow all the routine steps that they use when crossing the road. Police usually ask people to raise their hands towards the traffic when they are crossing the road. Instead of hand, now you can use your phone to alert the drivers during the night. 
Drivers also shouldnt arrive at the conclusion No crossing assistant (app) - no pedestrian. There are thousands of people who cant afford a mobile phone which supports this app. So drivers still need to pay attention to the road and keep an eye out for pedestrians, he said. 
The app was available free. I dont earn anything from this app. My main target is to reduce the number of accidents and the number of deaths, with the help of this app, he said.

The deputy minister assured us we would be granted relief after referring the matter to President Maithripala Sirisena through Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, Mr. Ariyaratne said.
He said the National Salaries and Cadre Commission had not followed the instructions given by Prime Minister's Secretary Saman Ekanayake with regard to increasing their salaries and added that Mr. Ekanayake had instructed the commission to grant a pay hike under the circular 6/2006.
During the previous strike, we demanded the Railways Department to increase the salary scale of Engine Drivers, Guards, Station Masters and Controllers to MP1 and MP2 categories, he added. (Chaturanga Pradeep and Kalathma Jayawardhane)

Not satisfied with UNPs present conduct - JRs grandson
	
While pledging to defeat the new proposed Constitution, the grandson of the first Executive President of Sri Lanka Pradip Jayawardena said he has decided to contest the upcoming local government polls from the SLFP because he is not satisfied with the United National Party (UNP) conduct.
Mr. Jayawardena said yesterday at a press briefing that his grandfather introduced the present Constitution because there was a credible reason to introduce it but said there was no such need to bring in a new constitution today.
When asked why he decided to contest from the SLFP not with the UNP, he said even the JR Jayawardena came into politics from the communist party in 1941.
I have a problem understanding what the UNP is doing now, because the UNP is the inheritor of this Constitution and inheritor of the Presidential System. The UNP the one should be defending the President System. But today they try hard to break it, he said.
Mr. Jayawardena who is the SLFP organizer for the Gampaha said he would contest for the Colombo Municipal Council in the upcoming local provincial election. When asked whether former President Mahinda Rajapaksa asked him to join the Joint Opposition, he said Mahinda Rajapaksa had requested him to contest from the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna but said he would contest under the SLFP.
Defending the Executive Presidential system, Mr. Jayawardene said that there is a myth amongst some people that late JR introduced the 1978 constitution to enjoy excessive powers himself. The truth is that JR first proposed and called upon for the creation of an Executive in 1966 in the best interest of Sri Lanka. His nother attempt was in 1971 at the Constituent Assembly created by Sirimavo Bandaranayake.
He said if the late JRs proposal was adopted in 1971, Ms. Bandaranayake would have become the first Executive President of Sri Lanka and not his grandfather.
Commenting on the draft new Constitution proposals which are now out in the open Mr. Pradip Jayawadene says it is quite clear that the clauses relating to unitary state and Buddhism are being tampered with. Though we are told nothing will be changed, we must ask the question, if there is no change why touch them at all If we make the so-called changes, where would they lead us to asks Mr. Jayawardene.
What is the basis and what are we trying to archive from the new Constitution. In 1972, we wanted to create a republic. In 1978, we wanted to change the Parliament system and the presidential system. Whether it was good or bad, it was reasonable. What is the reason of a new Constitution he queried.
In 1995, former President Chandrika Bandaranayake sought to convert Sri Lanka in to a federal state proposing our country to be redefined as a Union of Regions. This is Federalism. In 1995, JR who was in retirement, read the entire proposal and the same morning called Ranil Wickramasinge, leader of the UNP and then Leader of the Opposition and asked him to immediately oppose the proposed Federal package.
Today we are playing with the Constitution again. The interim report of the steering committee wants to remove the word 'Unitary' and replace it with the Sinhala word Ekeeya Rajyaya and the Tamil word Orumiththa Naadu.
It is also proposed that the Presidential system is abolished. We have already devolved power to the provinces through the 13th Amendment. The President and his representative, the Governor, is the only safeguard we have against secession. As we all know Varatharaja Prerumal already tried it once and failed because of the Executive Presidency.
It is now too late to abolish the Executive Presidency. If we abolish it and centre's executive power around the PM, the executive would no longer be independent and comes under pressure of party politics. We know that MPs can be swayed due to many influences. They can then threaten the PM as his survival is dependent on them he said. (Darshana Sanjeewa)

PC Polls (Amendment) Act: SLMC cries foul over enactment process
	
The Sri Lanka Muslim Congress (SLMC), a ruling party ally, is now up in arms against the manner in which the government enacted the Provincial Councils Elections (Amendment) Act that provides for postponing the elections to the provincial councils which was due this year.
However, the SLMC is also among the parties that voted in favour of it in Parliament.
Party Leader and Minister Rauff Hakeem told the Daily Mirror his party had disagreements with the process adopted by the government to enact this legislation. He said the government smuggled in provisions, entirely different to the content of the original Bill placed on the Order Paper during the third reading or the Committee Stage.
We voted for something during the Second Reading and for another during the Third Reading, he said.
The Minister said the government, in the enactment of the 19th Amendment, did away with the provision to bring in Urgent Bills.
He said the purpose of this was to allow people to have sufficient time to challenge any Bill in the Supreme Court for constitutionality.
This is one reason why the Government of Good Governance needs to adhere to the time-honoured processes which have been followed in this House. It is a matter of regret for me that such a process was not followed sufficiently in this case, he said. (Kelum Bandara)

Physical exercise
	

The world is moving faster than we ever expected, so is the spread of both communicable and non-communicable diseases. If not for various pharmaceutical compositions, introduced targeting pathogenic culprits, we wouldnt be standing steady because illnesses would have taken control over us. This has always happened where preventive measures havent been effectively carried out. Invasive miscreants have the potential to rise up and surpass the bodys defense mechanisms, thus paving the way for numerous diseases. 
Its true that medications made of various chemical combinations do cure us when preventive measure fail. But they might also own numerous side effects which can have a negative impact on our overall health. This is why individuals tend to weigh risks versus benefits when drugs are prescribed.
As we all know, physical activities always come under conservative management and lifestyle modifications. Every individual is encouraged to engage in sweat producing workouts in order to remain fit and healthy. These tips go well with people who have been diagnosed with non-communicable diseases like Diabetes mellitus, Hypertension or Hyper cholesterolemia. With regard to such people their physicians would probably ask them to their lifestyle and diet and engage in physical exercises in addition to prescribed pharmaceutical treatment. This constant struggle between prevention, illnesses, treatment and cure has paved the way for health care professionals to invent a concept which is called EXERCISE IS MEDICINE. 
The phrase used in this concept sounds catchy and interesting. To know what exactly it is and how effectively it can promote health and prevent various diseases, we had todays Q &A session with Dr. Upul Madahapola, the Secretary of Sri Lanka Sports Medicine Association and ExCo member of Asian Federation of Sports Medicine. 
Exercise is Medicine is a global health initiative carried out by the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM). With its presence in 7 regions and 43 countries, following its launch in 2007, it mainly focuses on encouraging primary care physicians and other health care providers to include physical activity when designing treatment plans for patients. ACSM specifies the importance of referring patients to Exercise Professionals and putting them through an EIM Credentialed Exercise Programs, said Dr. Madahapola. 
We also want to spread the idea that physical activity is an integral part when preventing and treating diseases and should be regularly assessed and treated as part of all healthcare. This aspect of treatment hasnt been paid attention to by many of us, for some reason, said Dr. Madahapola.
Following are excerpts of the interview with Dr. Madahapola.
QHow do you approach patients when introducing this concept
Exercise is Medicine is carried out in a well-established manner in other countries and at national level. We are hoping to conduct work-shops and lectures to provide proper information and teach practical skills to our health care professionals. 
In fact we want to make our health care providers know that it is essential that every patient receives counselling for effective physical activities and are properly referred to professionals and introduced to a supportive progamme. All this is done keeping in mind the physical activity recommended for them and their health needs, stressesed Dr. Madahapola. 
He also stated that after becoming aware of this newest concept the number of wanting to use this programme will increase. When they see results they will find the necessary enthusiasm and energy to engage in the physical activities prescribed for them. 
We also aspire to increase the number of healthcare professionals who are assessing, prescribing and counseling patients in physical activity. We also intend to increase the number of clients attending health care institutions, to meet the WHO Physical Activity Guidelines, increase the number of qualified exercise professionals so that they can receive referred patients and make their input in preventing and treating patients with chronic diseases. We also intend to increase public awareness on the existing capacity of healthcare systems and organizations that provide scientific and technical support and also to engage and to promote physical activity and provide leadership

QWhat is the importance of redefining physical exercise as a form of prescribed therapy
Well, patients today only wish to have visible and touchable medication from doctors. They disregard advice given in other forms. Pharmaceuticals have made such an impact on the minds of our people and patients now tend to just sit and wait after the ingestion of a drug. 
Our main objective is to group patients according to their age, risk factors, co-morbidities and diagnosed condition so that a tailor-made prescription with the most effectual set of activities can be provided. For an example, an elderly patient with osteoporosis can be prescribed with seated activities. This cam be done with a care givers support. A patient with hypertension or coronary artery disease can be given a different prescription depending on the level of health and capacity. 
So, I think that our health care can be elevated to a new level through the use of prescribed physical exercise because there is a statistical requirement for this addition to medical health care.

QWhat is the role of state health sector with regard to this project
The Sri Lankan Sports Medicine Association (SLSMA) will serve as the host institution for the Exercise Is Medicine project. We are hoping to receive their fullest support in making this timely concept a reality. 
According to Dr. Madahapola, this concept will be soon inaugurated in Sri Lanka with the ultimate hope of witnessing a significant improvement in the overall health of citizens. Exercise Will Be Re-Defined, As A Part Of Standard Medical Treatment, Provided In The Form Of A Prescription.

SRI LANKA IS COGNIZANT OF  THE NEED TO CREATE A  COMMON INDIAN  OCEAN  IDENTITY  MARAPANA
	
Minister of Foreign Affairs Tilak Marapana said that Sri Lanka looks forward to a fruitful engagement in the two years ahead and reiterated its commitment towards the objectives of IORA at its Council Meeting, held in Durban, South Africa on October 19. Following are excerpts of the speech.
Sri Lanka looks forward to a fruitful engagement in the two years ahead
The global economic power centre is shifting rapidly to the East
The Jakarta Concord sets important standards and targets that would create a rules-based framework for us
The growing strategic importance of the Indian Ocean is a vital factor for the progress of the region
When an association of countries in the Indian Ocean Rim (IORA) was initially conceptualized, in 1995, the legendary South African Leader Nelson Mandela gave vision to the organization by aptly describing this union as The natural urge of the facts of history and geography should broaden itself to explore the concept of an Indian Rim of socio-economic co-operation and other peaceful endeavours. 
Twenty years after the formation of IORA as a single platform of the Indian Ocean Countries, as envisaged by Nelson Mandela, it is a unique occasion for us to gather in South Africa to continue the momentum and further advance all areas of cooperation under IORA. 
The theme chosen by South Africa IORA: Uniting the people of Africa, Asia, Australia and the Middle East through enhanced cooperation for peace, stability and sustainable development is indicative of the new Chairs commitment towards sustaining the progress made over the years and further strengthening of IORA. Sri Lanka looks forward to a fruitful engagement in the two years ahead and reiterates its commitment towards the objectives of IORA. Sri Lanka will extend its fullest co-operation to the new Chair, in all its deliberations and endeavors to provide leadership to the Association. 
Bonds of friendships
The Indian Ocean is a vast body of water and our shores are washed by its waves creating firm bonds of friendship and co-operation among us. Close neighbours or far away friends, we all share this enormous common resource that has the potential to make the lives of our peoples better. 
However, we need to act fast as time is of essence. The global economic power centre is shifting rapidly to the East. The Indian Ocean Region has an extraordinary opportunity to act on the synergies available in this emerging environment.

As you would recall, this year our leaders signed the Jakarta Concord, reiterating their commitment to the course of IORA. The Jakarta Concord sets important standards and targets that would create a rules-based framework for us to achieve the identified objectives within this Forum in the Indian Ocean region. We have the IORA Action Plan 2017  2021, adopted simultaneously with a clear road map for co-operation. We need to look at these broad frameworks of commitment, to make IORA a more vibrant organization and realize the vision of our leaders to the mutual benefit of our peoples.
Sri Lanka in this context supports the creation of a Working Group on Maritime Safety and Security, one of the six priority areas for collaboration. Sri Lanka would like to propose that as an internal arrangement this working group be divided into two sub working groups, one for Safety and the other for Security
Security factors
The growing strategic importance of the Indian Ocean is a vital factor for the progress of the region. Managing competition and strengthening cooperation would be essential, given that both these economic and strategic security factors have a direct impact on the future of this region. 
Freedom of Navigation is a historic norm upheld by all littoral states of the organization. Considering that the Indian Ocean carries half of the worlds container ships-one third of bulk cargo traffic and two thirds of oil cargo- and also considering the emerging non-traditional security threats to the Indian Ocean, it may be prudent that we enhance our collective security through additional mechanisms. In this regard I would like to refer to a proposal made by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe of Sri Lanka, who envisioned a Code of Conduct that essentially provides a set of rules and conditions that would guide interactions between IORA member countries, based on the 1982 UN Convention on the Law of the Sea. It will be a simplified arrangement for mutual convenience to strengthen the IORA unity, togetherness and cooperation, in order to ensure the freedom of navigation and unimpeded lawful maritime commerce and over-flight in the Indian Ocean. The Code of Conduct needs to be prepared on a consensual agreement as a facilitating arrangement for the benefit of the Indian Ocean countries.
Sri Lankas proposal
I recollect at this moment, Sri Lankas proposal in September 1970 to the Non-Aligned Movement Summit in Lusaka to declare the Indian Ocean as a Zone of Peace. We must endeavor to develop an Indian Ocean Order to safeguard the Indian Ocean Region. I believe this is the vision by our leaders when they reiterated their pledge in the Jakarta Concord to build a more peaceful, stable and prosperous Indian Ocean Region. 
Sri Lanka in this context supports the creation of a Working Group on Maritime Safety and Security, one of the six priority areas for collaboration. Sri Lanka would like to propose that as an internal arrangement this working group be divided into two sub working groups, one for Safety and the other for Security. Sri Lanka would like to take the lead on the Sub-working Group on maritime security and propose to schedule a meeting of the Sub-working Group in 2018, on the margins of the Galle Dialogue, which is an annual international maritime conference being hosted by Sri Lanka, since 2010. Sri Lanka, as you are aware, is a country that championed in combatting terrorism which also involved maritime terrorism, piracy, human smuggling and weapon smuggling as well as other security issues. Hence, Sri Lanka, with its vast experience gained in the past in combatting all forms of terrorism is well poised to undertake more responsibility in the cooperation in maritime security matters. We are an active member of the Indian Ocean Forum on Maritime Crimes. We would be happy to provide our knowledge and expertise in the sub-group on Maritime Security, under the proposed Working Group on Maritime Safety and Security. 
Sri Lanka is committed to the course of IORA and together with the member states and dialogue partners will be happy to contribute to the shaping of its destiny
Common Indian Ocean Identity
Sri Lanka is cognizant of the need to create a common Indian Ocean identity. It will further strengthen internal cohesiveness and cultivate strong people to people links. We must harness our historical affinities based on freedom of navigation, mutually beneficial trade and other peaceful endeavors. This collective identity should emphasize our ability to promote trade, educational partnerships, exhibitions and cultural engagements.
Accordingly, and as enshrined in the Jakarta Concord we must enhance trade and investments potential in the region, with specific interest to the development of Blue Economy, which could be the backbone of our collective growth, in the future. The potential of IORA to emerge as a powerful economic bloc is evident of the fact that our region represents a quarter of the global population and Blue Economy would be an intrinsic component of it. 
Flow of goods and services
We should commit ourselves to increasing intra-IORA flow of goods, services and expedite in the field of trade and commerce, eventually reaching a free trade arrangement where we should be able to eliminate tariff and non-tariff barriers. 
Sri Lanka, during the second Indian Ocean Conference held in Colombo recently, envisioned the need to establish an Indian Ocean Development Fund by IORA. This proposal merits consideration. Today, its a multi-polar world that is gradually taking its shape and in line with it, the global capital is also getting dispersed from one holder to multi stakeholders. In such a world order, it would be pragmatic to carefully craft the necessary financial armory for the future of the Indian Ocean Rim nations, by establishing an Indian Ocean Development Fund. 
Sri Lanka as a committed member of IORA has already set out the mechanism to establish the IORA Centre of Excellence on Ocean Sciences and Environment, under the Ocean University of Sri Lanka. The Centre will be fully functional, with allocation of resources, from 2018, which will enhance our capacities on Ocean Sciences and related areas of research, study and cooperation.

Sri Lanka is a country that is thriving, in her socio-economic development process and our future lies in the Indian Ocean. It is our belief that if we all work together, the common objectives, sustainable peace and prosperity in our region can be undoubtedly achieved. The opportunities are there - waiting to be exploited  and with ingenuity and unity we should be able to forge ahead. Sri Lanka is committed to the course of IORA and together with the member states and dialogue partners will be happy to contribute to the shaping of its destiny. Towards this end, Sri Lanka would be pleased to offer leadership to the association as the Chair, for the biennial 2023-2025, with the support of the IORA family.

Steps to be taken to prevent accidents
	
Accidents have been recognized as the leading cause of the most numbers of hospitalizations in Sri Lanka. Accidents also account for so many deaths and lifelong disabilities. Millions of people meet with accidents , are hospitalized and receive treatment as in-house patients each year. According to statistics, the number of people affected by accidents annually is around four million. When data is carefully observed it is obvious that these accidents could have been prevented. Accidents are caused due to lack of attention. People aged between15 to 44 are reported to be most vulnerable to death during accidents. As many as 10,000 die each year due to accidents. Road accidents kill nearly 3000 while suicides (also falling in the category of accidents) take the lives of more than this number of people. Poisoning, drowning, animal bites, violence, and murders also claim thousands of lives.
Some people spend more than half their lives in total disability. Therefore, accidents affect everybody; including family, friends, and society. We must also consider the cost incurred and the time invested in treating patients. The seriousness of accidents is expected to reach new heights, during the next decade. This is due to the growth in industrialization, urbanization and rapid changes to lifestyles. In addition, a considerable amount of money is spent from the budget as treatments on accident victims. 
According to Health Ministry data, the highest number of accidents are recorded through animal bites (33.1%) which is followed by falling (18.0%) and road accidents 15.9% . 1.8 % of all accidents happen due to poisoning. 
It has been revealed that the home has so much potential in terms of a place where accidents can happen. 42.5% of the accidents happen at home. The road has contributed to 27.3% of the accidents while the workplace contributes to 4.1% of the accidents. 2.7 % of the accidents happen at education institutes. 
The most number of accidents (24.9%) happen while people are travelling. 23.9% of the accidents take place while engaged in leisure activities. When data is carefully observed it is evident that many accidents are preventable if the necessary attention is given.
Ignorance, not following safety precautions, breaking laws, carelessness, lack of practice regarding first aid, shortcomings when transporting patients, unfavorable environmental conditions, defects in vehicles and other machines contribute towards accidents. Keeping people informed about what causes accidents will be extremely helpful.

## Title: The expatriation of culture

The expatriation of culture
	
The rift between exoticising a culture  thereby turning it into an object of study and assessment  and expatriating it  thereby looting and destroying its artefacts, its cultural relevance  is actually a fiction. Theres no rift, in other words, and if there is, it is largely fictional, and like all fictions is maintained to promote the kind of superficial gloss that Orientalism has thrived on: a separation of the material from the ideological in the Wests dealings with the East. What is there in the robbery of the Koh-i-Noor that bears any resemblance to the destruction of the temple and the kovil The assumption, sustained mischievously by Western scholars and intellectuals was, that the East was there only to be objectified, studied, and validated as inferior, ignorant, and immaterial. Back in the day the colonial project armed itself with religious tracts on the one hand and the sword on the other; now we have substituted that magic, otherworldly phenomenon called globalisation for those tracts.
If theres to be any meaningful attempt at globalisation there must be an exchange, as such, in the realms of culture and politics, which are, as I pointed out last week, interconnected. But we have been content with a globalisation that promotes affluence and materialism on the one hand and poverty and exploitation on the other. We advertise poverty to invite materialism, which as Professor Nalin de Silva rightly has noted depends on a largely Judeo-Christian frame of (two-valued) logic. Either it is, or it is not. Such a frame of logic can be squared with a dualistic conception of the world as it is and is not. The West has taken upon itself the role of defining what that world is, and should be, and what it is not, and should not be. Not hard to figure out whos behind what in this sorry state of affairs we refer to as modernity. Today.
Kissinger, the realpolitik of 19th century Europe to 20th century America, speaks for his clique when he writes that the East never went beyond the Newtonian phase of history
That essay of Henry Kissinger which I referred to last week (Domestic Structure and Foreign Policy) manifestly reflects all these points. Kissinger, who among other things is a Nobel Peace Prize recipient and a diplomat who introduced the realpolitik of 19th century Europe to 20th century America, speaks for his clique when he writes that the East never went beyond the Newtonian phase of history. What he means there is that the West is materialist, that it believes in an external reality independent of the senses, and that the East believes in internalising its surroundings. Edward Said alludes in his book to another essay, one by a renowned psychiatrist (Harold Glidden) and written in 1972, which extrapolates and contends that the Arab culture as such was based on a client-patron relationship that in turn promotes subservience and dominance. The dichotomy is clear: the West is domineering, destined to conquer; the East is doomed to serve, to be conquered. The one will win; the other shall lose.
Perhaps some points need to be made here. Perhaps we need to be reminded that when European doctors and students were actively banned from dissecting bodies, the so-called ignorant Arabs had discovered cures for several diseases. Perhaps we need to note that the Renaissance, which preceded the Reformation, the Counter-Reformation, and the Enlightenment, involved actively the confusion and congruence of both the West and the East, and that a key painting from this period, Raphaels The School of Athens, depicts Averroes and Zoroaster alongside Aristotle and Euclid. Perhaps we need to remember that the humanistic values which survived the Inquisition, and which were reinvigorated during the Renaissance, could not survive the Reformation and the Enlightenment, which respectively promoted religious and secular values against the East, by now again demarcated as ignorant and ignoble.
In my article on liberalism that the White American Liberal has always sought to define the Negro on his terms, and not the Negros. The liberal does this by idealising a perfect variant of the former slave
Perhaps we also need to remember the role that popular culture has played in propagating these dualisms, mischievous and unnecessary as they are and always were. Kiplings India was not Forsters India, Emerson Tennents Ceylon was not Woolfs Ceylon. The shift from the one to other was the shift from a conservative to a liberal. Kipling has been denoted as a rightwing neo-fascist (regardless of his detractors and followers those epithets have followed him beyond the grave), but his depictions of Indian life were so accurate, if not romanticised, as to have come from an actual Indian. The same could have been said of Tennent, whose two-volume account of Ceylon is a testament to the colonisers interest in knowing the East more than the typical Westerner and even Easterner. Orient and Occident met, for a brief, intermittent period, with the bureaucrat and the artist; when the artist turned liberal, as Forster and Woolf did, there was a critique not just of the colonial system, but how that system spawned its own horde of brown sahibs, Mudliyars, and Muhandirams.
I noted in my article on liberalism that the White American Liberal has always sought to define the Negro on his terms, and not the Negros. The liberal does this by idealising a perfect variant of the former slave, which is how Stanley Kramer turned Sidney Poitier into John Prentice (from Guess Whos Coming to Dinner). But these were, while condescending, not really unflattering portraits of the Other. Such unflattering if not racist depictions of the Other came about when writers, poets, and filmmakers looked to the East as a means of vindicating their part of the world. It takes an entire film starring Cary Grant and Douglas Fairbanks Jr for a contorted, black-faced Indian played by a Jewish American to earn the line, Youre a better man than I am, Gunga Din. The Indian is better than the Englishman because he serves that Englishman. He serves the Englishman by being a stupid, incompetent, and downright simplistic man. In Gunga Din that Indian cant even march straight: his shoulders are always bent, his eyes always bulging too much. He cant be a better soldier, and among soldiers he can only be a better man to join their ranks.
Popular culture, is ambivalent, unclear, at times mischievously inaccurate. Pauline Kael once wrote can be taken as an indication that the popular culture is strewn with stereotypes and mythical depictions
Popular culture, as Ive observed many times in this column, is ambivalent, unclear, at times mischievously inaccurate. The movie industry is always frightened, and is always proudest of films that celebrate courage, Pauline Kael once wrote, and what she wrote can be taken as an indication that the popular culture we inhabit is strewn with stereotypes and mythical depictions of the Other which, while made to gain sympathy for those being depicted, actually sustains the interests of the intellectuals and academics that Edward Said attacked in his monumental book on Orientalism. Remember Mickey Rooney as Yunioshi from Breakfast at Tiffanys, or Rooney as Flip, the minstrel-show Negro-like toad, from Little Nemo: Adventures in Slumberland Well, those depictions were ostentatiously innocent, unintended. But nothing is ever unintended. No one is ever innocent. Its more complex than that.
What do all these lead us to The final journey from exoticising a culture to expatriating it, naturally. To be sure, not every mode of expatriation can be considered negative, regressive, harmful  think of Maurice Jarres beautiful score for David Leans A Passage to India, or Ravi Shankars attempts at Western melodies and instruments, or closer to home, Premasiri Khemadasas act of bringing the opera and the symphony to Sri Lanka  and obviously much of what is exchanged in cultural terms is to be welcomed as positive, progressive, and liberating.
But just as fictitious as the supposed rift between the cultural and the political (and this rift, I myself subscribed to until recently) is the rift between assessing a culture and destroying it. The one uses religious tracts, or secular science; the latter uses weapons. Sextus, you ask how to fight an idea. Well Ill tell you how: with another idea, Messalah declares in Ben-Hur. The clash of ideas being roughly equivalent to the clash of civilisations (as per Huntington), we can hence conclude that cultural exploitation is no different to political exploitation, in terms of their ability to alienate and uproot a way of life, indeed even a way of looking at the world.
In the end nothing is ever innocent. Kissinger may argue about how our part of the world is still stuck in the pre-Newtonian phase of human history, and Glidden may contend that we Easterners can only succumb, yield, and be psychologically dominated. But consider the extrapolation this leads us to: as Kissinger notifies us quite honestly and candidly, the dichotomy between the Orient and the Occident requires that the West construct an international order before a crisis imposes it as a necessity. In still other words, before hell breaks loose in this part of the world, its best that the West intervenes, meddling in our state of affairs if necessary, resorts to whatever permissible, legal methods to cleanse us of our sins, and then leaves.
It doesnt get any more innocent than that, folks. Today, tomorrow, or the day after.

The importance of proper Footwear
	

The feet dont receive enough attention compared to other body parts of the that we generally put out on display. Sometimes I am tempted to inquire from patients whether their feet receive one tenth of attention compared to their faces or hair Hence it is no wonder that most feet I see are in bad shape.
The entire body weight is borne by the ankles and the structure up to the tiny bones of the feet. This is the structure which helps us whenever we stand, walk or run. The feet perform this amazing task of weight bearing. Throughout our lifespan there is a lot of wear and tear taking place in our feet. The foot has two curvatures. One from the front of the foot to the rear. And the other is from middle part of the foot to the outer aspect. Every body structure serves a purpose. The foot curvatures are like shock absorbers of a vehicle. This curvature becomes flat when force is placed on the foot and re-coils on its own when the feet are off the ground. 
The ankle joint is smaller, but bears more weight compared to the knees. Its firmly kept in place thanks to the several strong muscles and many band like structures called ligaments. These ligaments also hold the bones of the feet together. Scientifically we divide the foot in to three parts. They are the hind, middle and the forefoot. The hind foot is the area which is closest to the ankle. It has two large bones named talus and calcaneus. These two bones directly bear our weight when we stand. The mid foot has smaller bones that transmit the weight of the body to the corner most part of the foot called the fore foot. The toes and their bases constitute the forefoot, which is the terminal part of the foot.
When we walk, the heel hits the ground first. The next stage is when the entire foot hugs the ground and becomes flat. At this moment, our entire body weight is borne by just one foot as the other is off the ground. Then comes the heel off stage where we use the tip of the foot and toes to push the body forward; the propulsion phase. Finally, the big toe gives that very important final push before becoming airborne. We call this the toe off the ground phase.
Not all parts of the bottom of the foot bear weight. If you take a stroll along the beach and observe footprints, the outer side of the mid foot has made more indentation on the sand than the inner. This changes with regard to those who are flatfooted. This condition causes the body weight to be equally distributed over the entire bottom portion of the foot. The undesired areas which bear weight could cause pain in the foot. The exact opposite of flat feet is high arched feet. This is when the front to back curvatures of the foot are in excess. High arched feet could cause pressure related pain symptoms.
Take out your regular shoes or sandals, and observe the worn out heel. A lot can be learned from the wear and tear that has taken place at the bottom of the shoe. If the inner aspect of the rubber heel is eroded, that person pronated the foot when walking. This means that the feet are slightly twisted outward. If the foot is twisted in, then the rubber heel shows wear and tear on the outer aspect. This is called supination. Even though one might consider these as unimportant, joint specialists can use this information to treat foot pain.
So whats proper footwear A shoe or a sandal that snugs comfortably to your feet, has proper padded areas for the heels and the base of the toes are features of proper footwear. A proper running/walking shoe should first of all have a good out sole; this means a good bottom part for the shoe to hug against the floors, whatever the slippery surface might be. Two types of rubber are used for this. They are carbon rubber as seen in tires and blown rubber which is lighter in weight. The mid sole is the area of our foot that rests inside a shoe. This is comprises foamy material which is very comfortable. The upper part of the shoe covers all other aspects of the foot and has breathable material which allows air in.
In Sri Lanka, the issue that needs to be resolved among patients is the decisions taken regarding proper footwear. Many patients have no clue about what is best to wear and then end up with undesired foot problems. I have noted that certain types of ladies slippers and sandals have no supportive structures for the areas of the foot that bear weight. Without proper heel, arch and toe support they could cause problems on the long run. The out sole of any shoe should act as a shock absorber, with a cushion like heel. Most office shoes worn by gents have rock hard heels. The practice of wearing casual/sports shoes even during office hours is seen in the west. Even knee problems could be averted by switching to better shoes. 
High heels worn for several hours a day could lead to many joint problems. High heels prevent the weight of the body from getting equally distributed along the foot; instead the ball of the heel bears more weight. The unsteady posture adopted with high heels can lead to backache as well. 
If a patient is suffering from long term foot pain, there are ways of customising the footwear to minimise symptoms. Devices like a heel cushion, a medial arch support or even an insole fitted in to a shoe can help. Certain conditions like bunions or callosities need specialised care. Patients with diabetes should be extra vigilant on protecting their feet as they cant sense injuries easily. A shoe that covers the entire foot is ideal.

Utilizing Birth Date, Destiny and the Name Value Number for success in life
	
Numerology 24



We have in our previous articles discussed the Birth-date Numbers, Basic Numbers, Destiny (Compound) Numbers and Name Value Numbers.

The Birth-date Number is the number of the birth date, leaving aside the month and the year. For example, if a person has been born on July 5, 1985, his/her Birth Date Number becomes 5.
Basic Numbers are numbers from 1 to 9. We have already learnt how a number with two or more digits is to be reduced to a Basic Number.  For example, take 583. It is to be reduced to a Basic Number as follows: 5+8+3 = 16 and again 1+6 = 7.

When we were discussing the birth date numbers, we found the need to reduce the two-digit dates into a Basic Number as follows:

Birth date: August 18, 2005. The number has to be reduced to Basic Number 1+8 = 9.
We later discussed how to reduce an entire birth date (with the month and the year as well) to a Basic Number which we have described as a Destiny or Compound number. For example, take, 08.10.1979 as the birth date. We have to add the digits in the
deleting zeros.

8+1+1+9+7+9 = 35 = 8
In fact, no matter whichever way you add, you will get the same Basic Number. So let us follow two other formulas to add up the digits to arrive at a basic Number.

Formula 1                           
Day 08                                     
Month 10                      
Year 1979
1997
=1+9+9+7
=26
2+6 = 8
Formula 2
Day 08
Month 10
Year 19
79
116
= 1+1+6 =8
          

Thus we have arrived at the Destiny or Compound Number reduced to a Basic Number by different formulas.

We also have discussed the name value numbers. We hope readers may remember that we learnt that every letter in the English alphabet has a vibrational value ascribed to it and the Name Value Number represents the vibrational value of the name converted into a Numerical Value. We have also discussed the Name Value Numbers and their significance in detail.

What we have already discussed so far is only a preface to the new subject we are to discuss in this article.

Numerical principles and formulas are there not for academic interest alone, but for us to apply them in our day to day life. And the Birth Number is the easiest to use in our daily life.

Most of us usually plan out our day-to-day activity or rather draw the days agenda and note down each item in our diaries.

The days agenda may mostly make up of certain routine matters which you have to attend to as a matter of course. However, there may be very important events among them. There can be events which you yourself can decide as to when to happen. For example, in case of an event where you can exercise your discretion as to when it should take place, you can be guided by your Birth number. For example, if you were born on the 2nd of a particular month, you can pick the 2nd, 11th or 20th for the event.

Your Birth Date Number is definitely your lucky number. Naturally you want whatever event you plan or whatever project you embark on to be a success. You can ensure the success of your event or your project by launching it on a date which is in harmony not only with your Birth Date, but also the Destiny and the Name Value Number.

Who is responsible for this SHAM
	
Alleged Rs. 4 bil. financial fraud revealed in the dealings between Chinese Contractor and FormerIrrigation and Water Management Ministry Secretary regarding theGin-Nilwala Diversion Project

Astonishing revelations show how the former Secretary to the Ministry of Irrigation and Water Management, during the previous regime, had released a mobilization advance to the tune of Rs. 4012 million to the Chinese Contractor of theGin-Nilwala Diversion Project within 43 days. This secretary is now facing imminent arrest.
TheDailymirrorinvestigations unearthed that these payments had been made sans proper approval.
In such a backdrop, questions have been raised as to who has instructed the Ministry Secretary to release public funds to the project contractor, who was selected bypassing Government procurement regulations. 
The Colombo Fort Magistrate on Monday issued an arrest warrant against Engineer K.W. Ivan de Silva for his alleged involvement in the misappropriation of tax payers money. It is speculated that De Silva released these monies to the Chinese firm, CAMC Engineering Co. Lt, in three installments. These payments had been made a few days prior to Mahinda Rajapakses defeat at the Presidential Elections.
According to the B report submitted to the Colombo Magistrate Court by the Financial Crimes Investigation Division (FCID) on November 28, 2016, the first installment worth Rs.1000 million had been paid by the Ministry Chief Accounting Officer Ivan de Silva to the Chinese Company on November 24, 2014 while another Rs.2009 million had been released on January 1, 2015 followed by another payment to the tune of Rs.1003 million on January 6, 2015. The FCID is conducting further investigations under Section 386 of the Penal Code, No: 12 of 1982 of the Public Property Act under the Money Laundering Act No: 6 of 2005.
Plans are afoot to summon De Silva, who is domiciled in New Zealand, at the earliest, FCID sources said.
The Gin-Nilwala Diversion Project contract was signed on November 5, 2014 and 5% of the agreed fee was advanced as a mobilization payment soon after the agreement was signed between K.W. Ivan de Silva, of the Irrigation and Water Management Ministry, and Luo Yan, Chairman CAMC Engineering Company.
Although Rs. 4012 million had been paid to CAMC Engineering Co. Ltd, the contractors have failed to implement any ground work to date. During the present Governments 100 day programme the then newly appointed Irrigation and Water Management Ministry Secretary Gamini Rajakaruna, by letter dated June 22, 2015, wrote to CAMC Engineering Company requesting it to refund the advance made as mobilization payment until the temporary suspended project is re-commenced. 
Rajakarunas letter further stated as thus, The agreement has been signed between your company and the Ministry of Irrigation and Water Resources Management and an advance payment (part of the total agreed mobilization advance) also has been paid. This project will be implemented under the newly formed Ministry of Irrigation hereafter as the employer.
According to the agreement (Clause 5 of the main agreement) the contract shall come into effect when the employer confirms the date on which the conditions stipulated for the contract comes into full effect.
The cabinet Sub-Committee on Economic Affairs chaired by Hon. Prime Minister has directed to put on hold the work in the project and to do a proper inquiry before proceeding with the work. Therefore, I kindly inform you to temporary suspend any proceedings regarding project preparation activities until further notice. Also since part of the mobilization advance has already been paid and because this amount will not be used for mobilization of project activities immediately, you are kindly requested to refund same which will be paid back to you once the Government issues clearance to proceed with the project.
It was only one and a half years later that CAMC Engineering replied Rajakaruna. The engineering company responded by saying that it cant refund the mobilization advance as requested, but would carry out the project once the Government approval is received.
We are still carrying out feasibility studies-De Alwis
Project Director Lalith de Alwis told theDailymirrorthat the ground work will be commenced only after the feasibility tests are concluded.
I took over office in March this year and we are still carrying out feasibility studies. It will need more time to finish the feasibility studies before releasing the report, De Alwis said.
On November 28, 2016 we requested Colombo Magistrate Court to grant permission to obtain bank details of the Irrigation Ministrys account at Bank of Ceylon, Hyde Park Colombo (account number 7040840)  to find out how the money had been transferred to CAMC Engineering Company between December 1, 2014 and January 31, 2015, the B report further states.
Its learned that the investigators were able to unearth more details than what was expected of them and obtained all information regarding the suspicious transaction.
Meanwhile reliable sources from the Irrigation Ministry, speaking on the condition of anonymity, revealed how the former Chief Accountant objected and had declined in writing to Ivan de Silva that he cant release more than the stipulated project allocation for 2015.
When Ivan de Silva wanted Irrigation Ministry Chief Accountant to release a further Rs.2000 million, the Chief Accountant wrote back to De Silva on January 2, 2015 claiming that he cant release more than Rs.40 million which was the stipulated amount to be released for the project for 2015. Since Ivan De Silva knew that the Ministry had received money for all projects, carried out by the Irrigation Ministry, he insisted that the Chief Accountant and the Project Director to release Rs.2000 million until the remaining Rs.15000 million is released by the Treasury later, sources claimed.
The sources further revealed as to how De Silva told his officials that the total advance payment amounting to Rs. 3,700 million had to be paid to the Chinese company in 2015. They added that once the money is received from the Treasury, he (Ivan de Silva) will approve the payments for the entire amount. In a letter to the Chief Accountant and the Project Director, Ivan de Silva has further stated as thus, Although only Rs.40 million had been allocated for the Gin Nilwala Project for 2015, another Rs.12, 000 million had been allocated for other special projects undertaken by the Irrigation Ministry which confirms the Finance Ministry letter dated December 31, 2014. In my reply to the aforesaid letter, I have made a request to release Rs.3,700 million for the Gin- Nilwala Diversion Project. Since we have already received funds amounting to Rs.2000 million for the above project, the Finance Ministry informed us that another Rs.1000 million would be released in the future. Hence I give my approval to make arrangements to pay Rs.2000 million from the funds the Finance Ministry, funds which have been already released, and the rest should be paid once the remaining allocations are received.
When this scam was revealed, Director General of the Department of National Budget, A.R. Deshapriya by letter dated September 4, 2015 instructed the Irrigation Ministry Secretary R.M.W. Ratnayake to conduct an investigation to find out whether the staggering advance payment had caused a loss to the country and if so to find out who is responsible for the swindle.

Ministry officials pose with representatives of the Chinese company after signing documents on November 05, 2014

The Gin-Nilwala Diversion Project contract was signed on November 5, 2014and 5% of the agreed fee was advanced as a mobilization payment
AlthoughRs. 4012 mn had been paid to CAMC Engineering Co. Ltd, the contractors have failed to implement any ground work to date.
The sources further revealed as to how De Silva told his officials that the total advance payment amounting toRs. 3,700 mn had to be paid to the Chinese company
Director General of the Department of National Budget had wanted Ratnayake to appoint a committee and conduct an impartial inquiry
Though Ratnayake had wanted the Treasury Secretary to appoint a committee to conduct the investigation, Director General of the Department of National Budget had wanted Ratnayake to appoint a committee and conduct an impartial inquiry. We were disappointed as to why the National Budget Department failed to conduct the inquiry, they were supposed to do, without asking Ratnayake to do so as he was working hand in glove with the accused.
Once again Director General, National Budget Department A.R. Deshapriya by letter dated November 16, 2015 instructed Ratnayake to appoint a committee and hold an inquiry into which, a three-member committee was appointed. Ratnayake appointed D.D. Ariyaratne as the head of the committee and included two senior officers in the Ministry. Ratnayake and Ariyaratne are said to have worked as Additional Secretaries at the Irrigation and Water Management Ministry under Ivan de Silva, who was then the Ministry Secretary. However the three-member committee report was released in early 2016 clearing De Silva from all charges levelled against him, sources said.
According to the sources, the three-member committee in their report has stated that the entire process from awarding the unsolicited contract to CAMC Engineering to making payments thereafter had been made legally and in the presence of transparency.
The credibility of the three member committee, headed by D.D. Ariyaratne- the then Additional Secretary (Irrigation Development)- was questionable as the then Secretary Ratnayake, Ariyaratne and Ivan de Silva worked in the same ministry when the alleged fraudulent act took place. In such a backdrop, can anyone expect the committee report to reveal the truth When there are documents to prove how Ivan de Silva had released Rs.4012 million and made China CAMC Engineering Company Limited an advance without obtaining the proper approvals, it is surprising as to how the three-member inquiring committee in its report stated that there was no controversy involved in the transaction, the sources added.
