A partial solar eclipse Today
	
A partial solar eclipse occurred in the 3rd quarter of Denata (Danishta) constellation in the Aquarius zodiacal sign beginning at 12.25 hours today, reaching the maximum eclipse at 02.21 hours and ending at 4.17 hours when it was still night time for almost the entire Asia. This came on the heels of a total Lunar eclipse that occurred in Aslisa constellation in Cancer Rashi at 16.21 hours (Colombo time) on January 31.
According to ancient Indian rishis, no auspicious event in life should be timed for the day of the eclipse and also for the three days before and after its occurrence. Further, no auspicious event in life should be held in the Rashi (Zodiacal sign) and the constellation in which an eclipse occurs on the day of the eclipse and during the 7 days before and after its occurrence.

Accuser had to become the accused
	

A politico at provincial level had to call on a very high political authority to explain why the party lost a majority of wards in the province at the recent polls.

The politico told his boss that the unpopularity of a certain person appointed to a high position by him (the latter) was the main cause for the partys defeat in the province.
The high political authority, after giving a patient hearing to the politicos explanation turned tables on him saying: The person you referred to had done no damage to our party. He had only criticized you. If you had done your part well, the party would not have come to this pass. He added: Some of your doings are no secret to me either!
The provincial politico quietly listened to the harangue by his political boss without daring to venture a reply, they say.

Ancient smoking methods can lead to cancer
	

Our tongues will always find new tastes. The taste for food differs from person to person. Therefore, food manufactures are willing to use artificial food additives in order to increase the taste, appearance and aroma of their products. But some people dont like to consume food which are enriched with artificial flavours enhancers since they have an adverse effect on our health. From ancient times, people have preferred adding some flavors to food since they increase palatability. As a result they have followed different food processing practices over several centuries. 
Smoking of food products can be identified as one of the oldest food processing systems. This method is used in food preservation activities to avoid loss of surpluses in produce and to add value to food products. Smoking is a method which offers diversified advantages in food industry. For example; it adds flavour, colour, reduces moisture content, improves texture and preserves food through the use of natural preservatives. The most common smoked food are fish, meats, shell fish, jackfruit and breadfruit In the coconut oil industry most of the coconut oil manufactures use this technique to dry copra efficiently and effectively. 
Smoking is a physical process and sometimes we see the use of chemicals. When the latter is the method smoke compounds interact with food compounds. Smoke from burning wood contains a number of compounds formed by the incomplete combustion of wood constituents. Phenols, carbonyls, furans, alcohols, and esters, lactones and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) are prominent chemical compounds which can be found in smoked food. Among these smoked compounds, PAHs in food directly cause adverse health effects. As a result smoked food must be strictly monitored. 
According to the recent publications by many researchers, most of the PAHs have identified as cause for cancer and genetic abnormalities for human while some are not. The most considered toxic PAH compound is Benzopyrene. 
In most rural areas, the smoking process is accomplished by exposing food into direct smoke by keeping them on a wooden rack built over the hearth or hanging such food over a fire; often the source here being burning wood. As a result all toxic compounds in generated flue gas will absorb into the food. 
As mentioned in many research publications, the composition and quantity of PAHs depend on several factors such as composition and type of wood, moisture content, oxygen accessibility, temperature of smoke generation, smoking duration, distance of heating, fat content of food, heat source etc. 
When we consider wood composition, a low content of wood lignin is highly affected to huge deposition of PAHs in smoked food. Therefore, scientists are highly recommending the use of hardwoods than softwood during smoking practices. Some researchers have channeled their efforts to investigate the types of wood species can be generate flue gas which does not contain huge amount of PAHs compounds during the smoking practice.
For this study they have used 05 different types of commonly used wood species named Mango, Jack, Coconut shells, Cinnamon and Madan. This study indicates that smoke generated by all five types of wood species were not safe for humans since those flue gases are rich with PAHs compounds in large quantities. 
Other than that, smoke temperature plays a significant role in PAHs generation. In the concentration of PAHs, in smoke formed during use of high temperature, (400-1000C), most of the fats in raw meat and fish generates PAHs and eventually that become deposited on smoked fish and meat. Fat pyrolysis is decomposition of fats in food by high temperature during cooking.
In addition, high moisture content in products may accelerate the production of toxic Benzopyrene. Moreover, fat content of food contributes to accumulation of huge level of PAHs residuals in smoked food since PAHs are lipid soluble in nature and usually accumulate in the fatty tissues of organisms. Furthermore, degradation of other organic matter such as proteins and carbohydrate in food under high temperature may involve to form PAHs while fat degradation under high temperature is a major contributor for PAHs production. 
The short distance between the source of heat and food and longer smoking time also affect to increase the level of PAHs residuals in smoked product. However domestic smoking is not only the major source of PAHs accumulation in food. Drying, roasting, baking, barbecue, frying or grilling are the other types of food preparation methods which contribute to generate PAHs.
Epidemiological studies show a correlation between the increased occurrence of cancer in intestinal tract and the regular intake of smoked food. Actually, this is a major threaten to the rural people of our country who live around inland water resources since traditional food smoking is very popular among them as food preservative practices to save surpluses of seasonal harvest for non-season as well. 
As a solution for this burning health problem, researchers in other countries have been developing modern smoking ovens such as liquid smoker as a substitute for traditional smokers while this innovative smoker remove all PAHs compounds and other undesirable compounds by using condensing and filtering techniques. And also one of the groups of scientists has proved that the use of charcoal filters, zeolite filters and gravel filters are helpful to decrease and remove the PAHs compounds produced during the using of ancient smoking methods. 
Moreover, few scientist in our country also made attempts to build a new food smoker by modifying conventional smoke with natural filters which can reduce the PAHs compounds in smoked food. Furthermore, the development of proper food packaging materials which can be used in smoking practices and have the ability to absorbed PAHs in emission smoke without penetrating into food could be a remarkable solution to protect food from PAHs. This is because in general, the highest concentrations of PAHs in smoked food occur in the food surface. 
Even today, in some rural areas of our country the practice of smoking food using traditional smoking methods continues. These users dont adopt modern technological methods due to lack of knowledge and also economic difficulties.
Therefore, still there is a requirement for development of efficient, safe, cost effective, and user friendly smoking methods which can be used in resource limited settings.

Ayurveda method of  burning fat fast!
	

Being called fat is one of the worst nightmares for a person who is overweight. Well, it is true that there are many fat people out there, and some of them enjoying being fat. However there are some among them who fret over their health, looks and the negative criticism directed at them. This article was written after facts were obtained from an interview done with Ayurvedic Doctor
D. D. A. Hettiarachchi. He is a traditional Ayurvedic doctor from Ganemulla.
The best remedyto burn fat
Horse Gram, locally known as Kollu (Macrotyloma uniforum) is a legume seed with high energy, low calories and rich in proteins. It prevents cravings by stabilizing the level of blood sugar. Soak a handful of horse gram overnight and boil the content.
Drink Kollu water on empty stomach in the morning. Continue this for a month, even if the results are not visible as expected, since it is an internal activity.

Exercise
Swimming is the most effective exercise that promises slim figure. While engaged in swimming your entire body is at work. Walking and jogging keep your feet engaged, but doesnt do much compared to the workout that swimming offers. Its the best exercise if you need to tone your physique.
Saarana (Trianthema portulacastrum ) a leafy green, which has urine purifying powers, can improve the performance of internal organs. This leafy green is said to be better than other common leaves like Kathurumurunga and Mukunuwenna.

Make condimentsat home
Do not buy chilli powder, chilli flakes, saffron and other powdered spices. Instead make those at home by yourself. The level of cleanliness is highly doubtful in products which are for sale. You must wash, dry, remove sand and other waste from spices and carefully prepare this at home. Various unhealthy materials are added to these products like wheat flour and dye to double the quantity and give a brighter colour. Therefore, prepare it yourself and then you will be able to enjoy tasty meals in addition to improving your health.

Fat cutting greens
Some greens and food we can find from the home garden or local market (village fair) can dissolve fat stored in the body. Cooking the core of the ash plantain tree (Alu kesel bada) produces a yummy dish. This preparation can be mixed with dhal or with papaya. If this cooked banana meal is eaten once a month, (for a healthy person) you will be protected from a number of diseases.

Gruel of Turkey Berry (Thibbatu)
Make gruel of it and drink for two days a week early in the morning. It is beneficial in reducing phlegm in the body. Having it cooked as a meal will also fight phlegm.
Consuming any type of healthy gruel in the morning and consuming green vegetables will keep your fitness at a higher level. By the way, some doctors have opined that coconut milk is unhealthy and people have got used to other types of oils like palm oil. Even experts today admit that coconut milk has the lowest amount of cholesterol. The consumption of deep fried food and highly oily food should be avoided. Oil is directly linked to weight gain. 

Dont skip meals
Trying to shed pounds by limiting the intake of food might put you in trouble. Sometimes it will lead to Anaemia. If you know you are having a large portion of food, then limiting is permitted.

A simple trick
First of all, check your cholesterol level and then start eating six or seven ripe Veralu (Ceylon Olive) fruits for an entire week, early in the morning on an empty stomach. Drink a glass of water immediately afterwards. Check the cholesterol level again in a week and see for yourself how effective this remedy is. This simple trick has reduced cholesterol, even in some who had this condition for years. I guess this this fruit will help you slim down too, Dr Hettiarachchi said.

Eating chicken
Doctors have different opinions regarding consuming chicken. Some say it is necessary to have chicken due to its nutritional value. Anyway medical opinion promotes the idea that broiler chicken affects human health.

Enemies of theslim figure
Phlegm has that superpower to puff you up like a balloon. Therefore, control phlegm to have your dream body as well as to be healthy. People do not consider phlegm as a dangerous disease. This is partly true, but it is better to get rid of it immediately. The level of phlegm in the body of an individual has a connection with his or her genetic inheritance. If you have phlegm, it means you are prone to a number of diseases.
The other enemy is the food you eat from fast food joints in the likes of kottu, Parata, fried rice, and varieties of food made of wheat flour and unhealthy oils flavoured with excess salt, sauces and other harmful additives. Try to avoid or limit consuming these highly unhealthy foods and eat home-made food as much as possible.

Booze drowned his sorrow, not his anger
	

A state purohita who campaigned heavily for the partys candidates in his district at the recent local polls had suffered a shock when all his candidates had lost. He had later drowned his sorrow and frustration in booze. When he had one drink too much his dismay had given way to anger and he had come out of the house in the night and screamed strings of obscenities at his neighbors.

When all efforts made to quieten the politico and put him to sleep had failed, his house aides and security men had gone back to sleep.
Later they had found the purohita fast asleep slumped in a chair outside the house and taken him back inside the house with much difficulty, they say.

Cabinet illegal, Prez has power to appoint PM: Sarath
	
In another conundrum to the present gridlock in governance, former Chief Justice Sarath N. Silva argued yesterday that the entire Cabinet including the Prime Minister stood illegal at the moment as the two year period stipulated for the national unity government had ceased.
The former Chief Justice told the Daily Mirror that the Cabinet should be restricted to 30 and the number of deputy and state ministers to 40 in terms of the 19th Amendment to the Constitution.
However, he said there was a separate constitutional provision to increase the number to 45 Cabinet Ministers in the event of a national government.
He said Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe moved a resolution in Parliament for the establishment of a national government in conformity with an agreement signed between UNP General Secretary Kabir Hashim and SLFP General Secretary Duminda Dissanayake.
As the entire two year period stipulated for the unity government lapsed in December, he said, the entire Cabinet had been rendered illegal at the moment.
Interestingly, the parties that were in the national government went before the people at the local government elections separately, he said.
He said the President now had the power to appoint someone commanding parliamentary majority, in his opinion, as the Prime Minister.
Then, the Cabinet Ministers can be appointed on the Prime Ministers advice, he said. (Kelum Bandara)

China angered as Indian PM visits disputed border region
	

BEIJING REUTERS Feb 15-China on Thursday expressed anger over a visit by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi to the remote Indian state of Arunachal Pradesh, which China also claims, and said India should stop any action that might complicate the dispute. 
China claims the region in the eastern Himalayas as South Tibet, and it has denounced Indian leaders visits there as attempts to bolster Indias claims. 
Chinas position on the China-India boundary question is consistent and clear-cut, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said in a statement carried by the official Xinhua news agency. 
The Chinese government has never recognised the so-called Arunachal Pradesh and is firmly opposed to the Indian leaders visit to the disputed area, Geng said. 
Chinese spokesman Geng said China and India had reached an important consensus on properly managing disputes, and the two sides were working to resolve their contested border through negotiation and consultation. 
Modi is expected to visit China in June for a summit of the Chinese and Russian-led Shanghai Cooperation Organisation security bloc.

## Title: Do you know enough about Meningitis

Do you know enough about Meningitis
	

Meningitis is an inflammation in the meninges membranes. Meninges membranes cover the brain and the spinalcord. The primary function of the meninges and the cerebrospinal fluid is to protect the central nervous system.
There are several types of meningitis infections such as bacterial, viral and fungal. Meningitis is almost always caused by bacterial or viral infections that begin somewhere else in your body besides the brain, like your ears, sinuses or throat. The bacteria then travel through the bloodstream to the brain. Depending on the patients age and the type of infection, meningitis could prove to be deadly. Viral meningitis isnt nearly as serious as bacterial meningitis. 
Dailymirror got in touch with Doctor Deepal Perera, a Pediatrician, to shed light on the subject. 
The inflammation that causes meningitis is normally a direct result of either a bacterial infection or a viral infection. Other than that, fungal infections are known to cause meningitis too. There are instances where the inflammation caused by the infection progresses past the membranes of the brain or the spinal cord. This process is then called Encephalitis, or in laymans terms, the inflammation of the brain.

Infants and toddlers
Infants and children under two years seem to have the highest incidence of contracting meningitis, especially during the first few weeks after birth. Underlying immune system problems that are present at birth and increased exposure to infections increases the risk of meningitis in children.

Neonatal meningitis is often life threatening to newborns and bacteria such as E. coli, B Streptococcus and Listeria are notorious to causing meningitis. Neonatal meningitis is a potential cause of cerebral palsy if not properly diagnosed and treated. Toddlers have the risk of contracting meningitis through bacteria and the condition could ultimately result in meningococcal meningitis which is a rare, but serious bacterial infection. Other than bacteria, certain fungi and viruses are known to cause meningitis as well. How serious the condition is and how doctors should treat them depends on which type of infection a person has. 

Why its deadly
Meningitis proves to be deadly if its not treated immediately. That is why its extremely important that you pay attention to the symptoms and get prompt medical treatment at the earliest. The symptoms of bacterial meningitis strongly resemble the flu. 
Symptoms include: fever, cold hands and feet, vomiting, drowsiness, fatigue, irritability, muscle pain, pale, blotchy skin, severe headaches, sensitivity to light and still neck. 
Bacterial meningitis is life threatening while viral meningitis tends to be less severe. Fungal meningitis occurs in people who have an extremely weakened immune system. If bacterial meningitis goes untreated it can lead to lasting disabilities such as deafness, speech impairment, brain damage, blindness and paralysis. If diagnosed and treated early enough, most people do recover. As the infection spreads, it can lead to an overall infection of the organs of the body and its systems. 

Treatment
The age of the patient is a key factor when treatment is given for meningitis. Early diagnosis is extremely important and involves culturing blood and spinal fluid. A CSF (Cerebrospinal fluid analysis) has to be done and neonatal patients are treated continuously for 21 days and sometimes even more than that, said Dr. Perera. Prompt treatment can mean the difference between life and death. Prevention is better than cure and because of that there are certain precautions that you can take in order to prevent bacterial infections that could ultimately cause meningitis. 
These precautions are: Dont share glasses, water bottles or eating utensils, wash hands often with soap and water, always use clean tissues and towels, keep your distance from infected people, boost your immune system and obtain prompt treatment.

The Joint Opposition (JO) yesterday told the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) not to be afraid when making a decision to form its own government and assured them that they were there to support them once they make that call.
MP Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena said that the JO MPs had decided at a meeting held last morning to offer its unconditional support to the SLFP in the event it broke away from the unity government it had formed with the United National Party (UNP).
The meeting was held under the leadership of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa at his residence in Wijerama Mawatha in Colombo 7.
We have been telling the SLFP from the beginning that we will support them if it exits from the government. At the meeting, we decided to support the SLFP to form a government without any condition. We would like to tell the SLFP not be afraid and that we will be right behind them, he told Daily Mirror. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

Facing the challenges that Menopause brings
	

From the moment of birth to the last breath that we take, there are milestones in our life, which can be considered as transition points from one era of life to another. Menopause is one such important milestone in the life of a woman. It marks the end of her fertile reproductive period, and the beginning of the next more relaxing period of her life. This transition can be a challenging period of time to a woman. Are there any steps that you could follow to make this transition smoother Health Capsule consulted Dr. UDP Ratnasiri, Consultant Obstetrician and Gynaecologist at the Castle Street Hospital for Women, to obtain more information on the topic, on behalf of our readers.Following are excerpts of an interview done with
Dr. Ratnasiri.

QWhat is Menopause
Menopause is defined as cessation of menstruation in a woman. Medically speaking, we consider a woman is having her menopause when she did not have her menstrual period for a year in a row or in women who are having symptoms of menopause, for six months in a row. 

Q Whats the usual age that a woman undergoes menopause
There is no specific age as such, since it differs from woman to woman. Usually the average age for menopause ranges from 45 years to 50 years of age. But this is subjected to change in different ethnic groups, countries etc. 

Q Why does this happen
The causing factor for menopause is the failing of the ovaries of a woman. The two main functions of the ovaries include ova production and synthesis of hormones like oestrogen and progesterone. First, the process of ovulation ceases due to a lack of ova. Then the hormones produced by the ovaries also disappear gradually, over time. 

Q What are the symptoms related to menopause
Most of the symptoms of menopause are due to the lack of the hormone oestrogen. Oestrogen has a big role in maintaining the functions of the female genitourinary system. In addition, it helps in maintaining the emotional stability of a woman. 
The symptoms can be categorized into physical, psychological and psychosomatic. 
Physical symptoms include dryness in vagina, Incontinence, urinary urgency or lack of ability to control the bladder muscles, lack of libido and pain during intercourse. 
Psychological symptoms can present as depression, lack of memory and reduced tolerance to external stimuli resulting in emotional instability. 
Psychosomatic symptoms or the physical symptoms which are aggravated by mental factors include hot flushes, night sweats and irritability. 
Additionally and perhaps more importantly, there are long term consequences associated with menopause like bone fragility which is associated with increased risk of fracture in hip bones and arm bones as well as the vertebral column. Skin changes like reduced elasticity can also happen long-term. 

QIs there any treatment for the symptoms
Yes. Treatment has a place, especially when it comes to women who are having early menopause, as well as in women who have severe, life disturbing symptoms. Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT), or supplementation of the deficient hormones from outside is the main method of treatment. 
If the menstrual period ceases before 40 years of age, they have to undergo investigations including blood hormone assays to confirm that they are indeed having menopause. They will have to take hormone replacement therapy, until the age of normal menopause, in order to minimize the risk of fractures and other side effects. 
Women who are having severe symptoms related to menopause may also be prescribed hormone replacement therapy, in order to improve their quality of life. 
In addition, lifestyle modifications play an important role in treating menopausal symptoms. 

About HRT
There are two categories of HRT. Oral oestrogen and combined HRT; containing both oestrogen and progesterone. Oestrogen only pills are known to increase the risk of cancer in the uterus, hence is usually only prescribed to women who have undergone surgery to remove their uterus. To relieve local symptoms like vaginal dryness and urinary insentience, vaginal pessaries and creams containing oestrogen can be used. 
But to prevent systemic effects like fractures, oral or hormonal patches should be used. 

QIs Hormone Replacement Therapy advisable to all womenundergoing menopause
No. Consulting a doctor before starting HRT is extremely important because HRT is not for everyone. Women who are having medical problems like clotting problems should not take HRT. It is not advisable to continue with therapy after 60 years of age because there is a risk of significantly increasing cardiovascular diseases and breast cancer. 

Q What is the place that lifestyle modifications have in treating menopause associated symptoms
Stopping or minimizing smoking and alcohol intake, daily exercises, dietary modifications to include a balanced diet, low in fatty and starchy food, has proven beneficial in reducing the symptom severity. In addition, minimizing the stress through engagement in social work, going on trips or having other leisure activities will also help in coping with the challenges of menopause. 

Q Any last message to the readers
Yes. Unlike in the past, with the development of the world, people live longer. So, by the time that a woman goes through menopause, approximately 1/3rd of her life lies ahead of her. So, she need to anticipate the challenges, both physical and psychological that menopause would bring. Leading an active healthy life from a young age can go a long way towards a smooth transition to the next era of her life.

Fitch Ratings has assigned Commercial Bank of Ceylon PLCs (CB, AA(lka)/Stable) proposed Basel III-compliant subordinated unsecured debentures of up to Rs.10 billion an expected National Long-Term Rating of AA-(lka)(EXP).
The debentures will have maturities of five and 10 years and carry fixed coupons. The debentures will qualify as Basel III-compliant regulatory Tier-two capital for the bank and include a non-viability clause whereby they would convert to ordinary shares if so determined by the Monetary Board ofSri Lanka.
The debentures will be listed on the ColomboStock Exchange.
The bank plans to use the proceeds to strengthen its Tier-two capital base and support its loan book expansion.
The final rating is subject to the receipt of final documentation conforming to information already received.
Fitch rates the proposed Basel III Tier-two notes one notch below the banks National Long-Term Rating of AA(lka).
This reflects the notes higher loss-severity risks compared with senior unsecured instruments due to the notes subordinated status.
CBs National Long-Term Rating is used as the anchor rating because the rating reflects the banks standalone
financial strength.
Fitch believes the banks standalone credit profile best indicates the risk of becoming non-viable.
Fitch has not differentiated the notching on the proposed notes from the notching on CBs legacy Tier-two notes as it is assumed that the authorities would step in late, moving the point of non-viability closeto liquidation.
Fitch has not applied additional notching to the notes for non-performance risk according to our criteria, as the notes have no going-concern loss-absorption features. CBs ratings reflect its modest risk appetite, strong funding profile, solid franchise andstable performance.

High Court permits Namal to travel abroad
	
The High Court today permitted Namal Rajapaksa to travel abroad from February 20 to May 30.
He was previously not allowed to do so because of the magisterial inquiry into the alleged misappropriation of funds in the 'Krish' deal.
Permission was granted on the basis of a request he had made to attend the Commonwealth parliamentary conference and two youth conferences in Nepal and Russia.
The Fort Magistrates Court also permitted him to do so last Monday. (Yoshitha Perera)

His skeleton in the cupboard
	

This person is now functioning as the private secretary to a very high political authority. He had obtained an official vehicle worth Rs. 15 million for his use when he was serving as the public relations officer of his present boss when the latter was only a top team member. The vehicle had got damaged in a road accident some time ago when he was using it and he had concealed it without reporting the incident to the authorities, an informed source said.

This person contested the recent local polls as a candidate of a main political party and his close associates say that he was in a funk lest someone would come out with the story about the hidden vehicle during his campaign.
What is surprising, our sources say, is that neither the Ministry where he once worked nor any other authority has failed to make any inquiry so far about the missing vehicle.

Ill continue as PM under the Constitution: Ranil
	
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said today he would continue to function as the Prime Minister under the current Constitutional provisions and that any attempt to form a new government should also be carried out in line with those provisions.
"We conducted the local government elections on a single day and it was easy to organize the elections," he told a news conference. "We accept the results of the elections and it indicates a setback for all political parties within the government. That has to be accepted. The reason for the set back are the adverse situations on the economic front. We managed to stabilize the economy in 2016 and 2017. The Central Bank informed us that it was expecting a 5 to 5.5 per cent GDP growth and the end of 2017. However the floods, drought and the Meetotumulla tragedy created several issues. Prices of essential items went up. We managed to control it to some extent but coconut prices remain the same. The agricultural sector suffered a collapse. There are issues relating to fertilizer. Such issues would no doubt affect the popularity of any government. There were other reasons as well for the governments set back. We fulfilled a part of the pledges given by us on January 8, 2015 while there were others which were not fulfilled. We accept the warning given by the people."
The Prime Minister said studies were already underway to determine the success of the programmes launched by the government with a view to restricting them within the next two years while rectifying the shortcomings.
"We are carrying out discussions on restructuring the government in accordance with the new programmes and vow to carry the January 8 mandate forward. The UNP also suffered a setback as a political party. The party therefore will undergo a major restructuring programme. At the partys 70th anniversary I said it is high time that we produced a new leader. There are people who joined the party in 1970 and others who joined in 1994. Some of them can come forward and take over the party. The restructuring of the party will be one which enables a new generation to take over the leadership. The restructuring of the party will be implemented when the Elections Commission completes the formalities to form the new administrations of local bodies. The new leadership can takeover when those formalities are over. The party is currently discussing the modalities of restructuring," he said.
The Prime Minister said the current government would continue to administer the country.
"When I met the President he told me that other parties such as the joint opposition wanted to meet the President and I told him to go ahead with the discussions and get their ideas as well," he said.
The following are the questions asked by the journalists and his responses:
Q: You are taking of reforms in the UNP. What do you mean when you talk of reforms and how do you hope to get about it
It is to see the emergence of a new leadership group. That means young people. Some of them have been in politics for the past five to ten years. We have to bring them out. I have been in the party for more than 40 years. We want to ensure a smooth transition of the party leadership without disruption. I will discuss it with the members of the party and we will go ahead with it.
Q: You have been the leader of UNP for more than 20 years dont you think its time to hand over the leadership to someone else
Thats why I said we are going to create a new generation of leaders. It will be implemented when the Elections Commission completes the lists of elected members to local bodies. It won't happen in 24 hours.
Q: Reports say that you are being asked to resign from the post of Prime Minister. They say even the President is making the same request. What is your response.
We will work according to the Constitution.

Implement 25% Quota for Women in LG polls : Rosy
	
In reference to the statement made by Elections Commission (EC) Chairman Mahinda Deshapriya that the implementation of the 25% quota for women in local government elections is uncertain, Colombo's Mayor-elect Rosy Senanayake urged the EC Chairman to take steps to implement the 25% Quota for Women in LG polls immediately.
Issuing a press release, she said the 2017 Local Authorities Elections Act, which amended the Local Authorities Ordinance, was successfully brought before Parliament by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, and was the result of 20 years of agitation by women working on the ground. The Act was passed in unanimously in Parliament with not a single vote being cast against it.
As one of the driving forces behind the provision, I can say with certainty that the law on the minimum representation of women is clear-cut. Under section 27F of the amended Ordinance not less than twenty five per cent of the total number of members in each local authority shall be women members The section is unambiguous and straightforward; it is not open to interpretation, Ms. Senanayake said. Under the Ordinance,a minimum of 10% of nominees from each political party for election through the Ward system has to be women while a minimum of 50% of nominees on the separate additional persons List of each party has also to be women. This formulation was put together with the sole aim of ensuring that a minimum of 25% of the members in each and every Council are women.
Ms. Senanayake said it was necessary to amend the law to further clarify the details of how exactly women members had been allocated by each political party in different circumstances in order to ensure the 25% minimum of women members.

Insurance industry records 15.5% GWP growth in 3Q17
	
The insurance industry was able to achieve a growth of 15.53 percent (3Q 2016: 16.97 percent) in terms of overall gross written premium (GWP), at the end of the third quarter of 2017, recording an increase of Rs.15, 862 million when compared to the same period in the year 2016.
Gross written premium
The GWP for long-term insurance and general insurance businesses for the nine months ended on September 30, 2017 was Rs.118,016 million compared with the same period in 2016, amounting to Rs.102,155 million. The GWP of long-term insurance business amounted to Rs.51,893 million (3Q, 2016: Rs.46,540 million) while the GWP of general insurance business amounted to Rs.66,123 million (3Q, 2016: Rs.55,615 million).
Thus, the long-term insurance business and general insurance business witnessed a GWP growth of 11.50 percent and 18.89 percent, respectively, when compared to the corresponding period of year 2016.
Total assets
The value of total assets of insurance companies has increased to Rs.548,361 million as at September 30, 2017, when compared to Rs.497,868 million recorded as at September 30, 2016, reflecting a growth of 10.14 percent (3Q 2016: 13.41 percent).
The assets of long-term insurance business amounted to Rs.387,461 million (3Q 2016: Rs.342,072 million) indicating a growth rate of 13.27 percent year-on-year (YoY). The assets of general insurance business amounted to Rs.160,900 million (3Q 2016: Rs.155,796 million) depicting a growth rate of 3.28 percent.
Investment in government securities
The investment in government securities for the period of nine months amounted to Rs.181,791 million representing 46.92 percent (3Q 2016: Rs.162,084; 47.38 percent) of the total assets of long-term insurance business, while such investment of the total assets of general insurance business amounted to Rs.29,598 million representing 18.40 percent (3Q, 2016: Rs.33,503; 21.50 percent).
Accordingly, the total investment of both long-term insurance business and general insurance business in government securities amounted to Rs.211,389 million (3Q 2016: Rs.195,587 million). Thus, the investment in government securities of long-term insurance business has increased by 12.16 percent and the investment in government securities of general insurance business has declined by 11.66 percent.



PBT of insurance companies
The profit before tax (PBT) of insurance companies in both long-term insurance business and general insurance business for the nine months ended September 30, 2017 amounted to Rs.10,854 million (3Q, 2016: Rs.14,721 million) showing a decline in profit by 26.27 percent. The PBT of long-term insurance business amounted to Rs.5,110 million (3Q 2016: Rs.5,159 million) while the PBT of general insurance business amounted to Rs.5,743 million (3Q, 2016: Rs.9,562 million).
Thus, PBT of general insurance business showed a significant decrease of Rs.3,819 million (39.94 percent) when compared to the period ended September 30, 2016. This is mainly due to receipt of significant dividend income of an insurer during the year 2016.
However, there was no significant declaration of dividend income for the period ended September 30, 2017. Apart from the general insurance business, no material deviation noted in respect of the PBT of long-term insurance business for the period ended September 30, 2017.
Insurers
Out of 27 insurance companies (insurers) in operation as at September 30, 2017, 12 are engaged in long-term (life) insurance business, 13 companies are carrying out only general insurance business and two are composite companies (dealing in both long-term and general insurance businesses).
Insurance brokers
Sixty insurance brokering companies, registered with the board as at September 30, 2017, mainly concentrate in general insurance business. Total assets of insurance brokering companies as at September 30, 2017 have increased to Rs.4,148 million when compared to Rs.3,961 million recorded as at September 30, 2016, reflecting a growth of 4.70 percent year-on-year.

Minimum age for indictments up from 8 to 12
	
The Criminal Procedure Code (CPC) will be amended to increase the minimum age limit, for filing indictments, from the current eight years of age to twelve, Cabinet spokesman, and Minister, Gayantha Karunatilaka said.
He said convicting and punishing a child through a legal procedure is today considered a crime and a violation of Human Rights, Child Rights and the International Conventions entered into to protect children.
The minister said the amendments submitted by Justice and Foreign Employment Minister Talatha Atukorale were approved by the Cabinet on Wednesday.
Psychologists, educationists and social activists say convicting and punishing a child who is under eight years of age was a crime against humanity because a child at that age cannot realize the magnitude of a crime committed by him or her.
He said Sri Lanka hoped to increase the age limit to file criminal charges against a youth to 14 years.
The proposed amendments to the CPC state that a magistrate will be empowered to refer a child produced in courts on criminal charges to a psychiatrist or to a doctor to determine the mental condition of the child and whether he or she is physically and mentally capable of facing charges, able to undergo cross-examination and realizes the gravity of the offence committed.

More disasters awaiting!
	
While new local and international construction projects are mushrooming in Colombo, the city is already reaching a stage where most of its decades-old buildings need immediate redevelopment. The Daily Mirror learned that neither the Municipal authorities nor the Urban Development Authority (UDA) officials have a proper monitoring and maintaining procedure with regard to the old buildings. The recent unfortunate incident reported in Grandpass, where seven people, including four women, died after a warehouse, storing spices, collapsed on them. All those affected by this collapsed building were poor working staff. Two injured workers are still fighting for their lives in the National Hospital. However, the Daily Mirror, found out that apart from the warehouse building being decades old, there was another outside reason which caused the sudden collapse, killing the workers who got trapped within.

The incident
The building belonging to Adam Exports, used for the packaging of spices, is located at Babapulle Mawatha, Grandpass. It collapsed around 3.00 pm on February 14 (Wednesday), killing seven workers and injuring another two. Rescue teams with the support of Fire Brigade, Army and Air Force personnel carried out operations and discovered three dead bodies. Six severely injured people were admitted to hospital. Later, four of them were pronounced dead. Among the dead are four females and three males. Another male and a female are currently being treated at the hospital. Hospital sources told the Daily Mirror that the condition of the injured is serious. 
Police sources told the Daily Mirror that the building is around 165 years old and some demolition work had been going on in the building next to it. According to sources from the rescue team, a part of the adjourning building had fallen onto the warehouse building, triggering the sudden collapse. 
Warehouse security guard has narrow escape
Our stores manager first heard the noise of roofing sheets trembling. He called me and the owner of the warehouse, where spices are stored. When we took the first few steps into the warehouse, we witnessed the roof and walls having collapsed and the entire warehouse was covered with dust. I dont know why it was caused. I just ran outside the warehouse and managed to save my life. After sometime, I along with some other workers went inside in search of the boss and the supervisor. The latter was found dead. Our boss later succumbed to his injuries. Around nine workers were inside the warehouse at the time of the collapse. The warehouse and the factory are used for packing of all Sri Lankan spices and exporting them. The majority of the workers are females, the security guard of the warehouse who escaped the disaster said. 
165-years-old warehouse building badly needed a repair
An individual named Mahendran, who claimed to have worked in the warehouse some years ago, told the Daily Mirror that the warehouse building was so old that it badly needed a repair. He also said that the owners didnt bother to re-develop the building and all what they did was do patch-ups whenever some parts of the wall fell off. 
The OIC Colombo North Police when contacted said that it wasnt clear as yet what had caused the collapse. We will only know the cause in a day or two following inquiries, the OIC told the Daily Mirror.
However, a source close to the police confirmed that although it was not officially announced, some on-going work at the building that included demolishing activities caused the collapse, trapping the workers within.
Unsafe buildings
Senior architect and urban designer Lalitharaja Muthukumarana, speaking to the Daily Mirror said that within the Colombo Municipality, there are many dilapidated and dangerous to inhabit buildings that have gone unnoticed by the authorities. Muthukumarana said that the authorities should start demolishing or repairing the old buildings in order to protect other properties and residents who live close by. 
The redevelopment projects should specifically include all the buildings in Colombo which are old and may collapse at any given time, he said. 
He added that following inspection, a technical report on the condition of each building should be submitted to the relevant authorities of the buildings to take suitable action. 
The buildings should be taken down completely or revamped entirely to protect the lives of the inhabitants, he affirmed. 
Many reasons including environmental impacts, using sub-standard materials, using wrong constructing technology and poor maintenance can cause buildings to collapse, he pointed out. 
He stressed that the authorities should consult experts in order to put the development plans into practice. 

"Due to negligence of the developers, seven people have lost their lives"
"Within Colombo, there are many dilapidated and dangerous to inhabit buildings that have gone unnoticed"
"Awareness programmes should be carried out to inform the public regarding the seriousness of the issue"
Redevelopment of buildings for commercial purpose
The former Governments carried out redevelopment projects aimed at turning selected historical buildings into the tourist attractions and commercially valued locations. Among them, Arcade - Independence Square is one of the most important refurbishment and development projects undertaken by the Ministry of Defence and the UDA. It used to be the old Auditor Generals Building formerly. 
The UDA stated that a special team of architects were dispatched to Paris, France to gain international exposure to heritage buildings and the beautification of a well planned city. 
Colombo Racecourse Sports Complex is also one of such redeveloped projects. In 2011, the renovation of the Grandstand and the Colombo Turf Club building were done and they were turned into an international Rugby Stadium. Dutch Hospital  Colombo situated opposite the World Trade Centre, is believed to have been built around 1681, according to Christopher Schweitzer, a German national serving in Sri Lanka. The building too went through serious redevelopment process. 
Calls to increase public awareness
All the above mentioned re-developed buildings provide an income to the Government. Yet, there are many unnoticed really old buildings where the general public inhabit or engage in some sort of businesses. Those buildings, with patchy walls and roofs vulnerable to collapse, have become a sorry sight in some parts of Colombo such as Colombo Fort, Pettah and Grandpass. 
Former Chairman of the UDA and renowned Professor in Architecture at Moratuwa University Prof. Nimal de Silva opined that awareness programmes should be carried out to inform the public regarding the seriousness of the issue. He stated that residents and owners of such old buildings have no idea about the status of the buildings they are living in and whether they should undergo relevant re-development process. 
Its not an easy task to identify all the old buildings in the city and develop them. It needs a broad and effective plan. Owners of private buildings are not willing to change the structure of their old buildings. Further, it is impossible to visit every single household or business entity and inspect the status of the every single building. Owners of those buildings dont like that too, Prof. de Silva said. 
He said what needs to be done is raise peoples awareness and persuade them to seek technical support and guidance if they need to redevelop their properties. 
He also stressed that knowledge of professional architects should be utilized for the up-coming projects in order to provide a better solution to the issue. 

Owners of the building should be held responsible - Mahanamahewa
A case should be filed against the owner of the building, that was being demolished, under civil and criminal charges, Former Chairman of the Human Rights Commission Prathiba Mahanamahewa told the Daily Mirror. Mahanamahewa pointed out that the owner, the engineers and all stakeholders attached to the said building should be held responsible for the loss of lives.
He also called for amendments to the construction law applied in the country in order to make it easy for law enforcement agencies to take action during these types of incidents.
NBRO clears doubts about the cause
Meanwhile, a team from the National Building Research Organisation, Sri Lanka (NBRO) visited the site on February 15 (yesterday) morning. The visit was made following a request made by the police to compile a preliminary report regarding the collapse of the building to find out the cause. The report was expected to be handed over to the police last evening. 
Project Management Director of the NBRO Kumuduni Jayawardane headed the visit. She is responsible in making the report. When the Daily Mirror inquired from Jayawardane to explain the cause of the collapse, she said, A wall of the building that was being demolished had fallen on the roof of the warehouse, causing its collapse and killing workers who got trapped inside. Our team observed that the demolishing activities that were being carried out at the building next to the warehouse did not comply with specified guidelines. Necessary technical methodology and machinery were not used by the developers. They should have informed the people in next building about these activities in advance, she said. 

"Our team observed that the demolishing activities that were being carried out at the building next to the warehouse did not comply with specified guidelines"
According to her, the building that was being demolished was a three-storey building. The said building is very much attached to the warehouse and any constructional activity could make an impact on the warehouse, she stated. 
Jayawardane noted that there is a set of guidelines and protective methods to be followed when demolishing a building, especially a three-storey building like this. 
Due to negligence of the developers, seven people have lost their lives. Police will take necessary legal action according to the Penal Code. The legal action taken by the Police will be based on the NBRO report that we are currently working on. We hope to submit it this evening, she said.

MYTH: Carbonated diet drinks are fine because they dont have excess calories.
BUSTED: This is not true. Carbonated diet soft drinks may not contain calories, but they tend to contain a lot of artificial sweeteners. These can surely be consumed to quench your thirst, but the rule here is that you limit their intake. Just as there are advantages and disadvantages to everything, the advantage here is that these carbonated diet drinks contain next-to-non calories. The downsides to these drinks are that they contain a fair amount of phosphoric acid which softens tooth enamel & promotes plaque formation. Carbonated drinks arent very good for your teeth. Because these drinks dont contain any other nutrients other than empty calories, you can always opt for healthier alternatives such as natural fruit juices or daily based products, said Doctor Anoma Chandrasekara, a nutritionist and current Departmental Head of Applied Nutrition, Wayamba University.

Ramaphosa elected South Africas new president
	
By Kevin Sieff, Krista Mahr-
(c) 2018, The Washington Post Feb 15, 2018 - JOHANNESBURG - Cyril Ramaphosa was elected by a majority in parliament as South Africas president on Thursday, marking a turning point for the country after the slow-motion collapse of the once-legendary ruling party under Jacob Zuma.
Zuma resigned on Wednesday night under mounting pressure from his party, the African National Congress (ANC), leaving both the leadership of the ANC and the continents second biggest economy in the hands of Ramaphosa, 65.
After the parliamentary vote, Ramaphosa addressed the nation for the first time as its leader. He will be sworn in later on Thursday.
Our intent is to continue to improve the lives of our people, he said.
Like Zuma, Ramaphosa is a member of the ANCs revolutionary vanguard. 
For years, he had been rumored as an heir to the countrys presidency. But the country he inherits is far from the one envisioned by Mandela and his acolytes. Ramaphosa faces the complicated task of rehabilitating a government in decline as well as reviving the promise that Mandela articulated at the dawn of South Africas post-apartheid era.

Realities associated with retinitis
	

Myopia, hypermetropia, presbyopia and amblyopia, weve heard of them all. They are the more general eye issues that many people have to deal with quite commonly on the grounds of visionary complications. However, once in a while people fall victim to some vision issues that are not very common, but can cause quite an impact on the quality of vision once a persons eyes are inflicted by the disease. One such vision complication that can be categorized as such is retinitis. This complication of the eyes affects the retina of the eyes as you may have very well guessed.
While retinitis is not a very common condition in Sri Lanka, it is also not unheard of and can cause damage to eyesight. Therefore it is quite useful to stay informed about the disease as ignorance is not always blissful.
Dr. M. Wijetunge, Retired Consultant Eye Surgeon of the Ragama Teaching Hospital, provided an insightful elucidation on retinitis for this weeks edition of the Health Capsule. 
Retinitis is the inflammation of the retina of the eyes. The condition causes a significant impact and damage to the retina and thereby affects vision, said Dr. Wijetunge. The retina is the innermost area of the eye which is also the nervous tissue layer of the eye. It consists of mainly light sensitive cells i.e. rods and cones and pigment cells. The light sensitive cells are stimulated by light that gets focused on the retina. Consequently this causes the rods and cones to send signals to the brain through the optic nerve which is how we perceive vision of objects around us. It is quite comprehensive that the retina is a very important part of our eyes. What happens when the retina is victimized by an infection Of course the answer is that visionary complications will arise. 

Types of retinitis 
Speaking of the causes that lead to retinitis, Dr. Wijetunge stated that sometimes retinitis occurs without any particular cause, but sometimes there are general causes depending on the type of retinitis. Retinitis comes in many forms. Retinitis could be congenital. There is a group of eye diseases that are genetically inherited. This is known as retinitis pigmentosa. Parasitic infections also make way for retinitis. Viral infections and bacterial infections could cause retinitis. There is a form of retinitis called neuroretinitis which affects both the retina and the optic nerve. Optic neuritis can also add as a causative factor responsible for retinitis, he added.
Dr. Wijetunge also explained that viral infections like HIV which causes a drop in immunity makes the body susceptible to even the mildest forms of infections. Therefore retinitis can easily be contracted by such a person. The cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a herpes virus. It usually causes no harm. When the virus infects a person with a weak immune system, it can cause retinitis in the patient, he added.


Symptomatic Signals 
The symptoms that appear are mainly negative impacts on vision. Patient may experience reduced vision and vision loss. There may be a slight pain experienced. The degree of vision loss depends on the infection and the area of the retina infected by the condition, stated the eye surgeon. Certain conditions of retinitis, retinitis pigmentosa for instance, can lead to complete vision loss. The rate at which the vision is reduced will differ from one patient to another. Some forms of retinitis may include symptoms such as blurred vision, loss of night vision, loss of peripheral vision and tunnel vision.
The condition is diagnosed by clinical methods when the eye is subjected to examination. Conditions like vasculitis and macular edema can lead the diagnosis towards retinitis. Some cases of retinitis can be treated while some other forms cannot be cured.
The treatment too depends on the form of retinitis. Congenital retinitis such as retinitis pigmentosa cannot be cured whereas conditions of retinitis that arise due to parasitic infections, bacterial and viral infections can be cured by medicine, explicated Dr. Wijetunge. It should be understood that retinitis is an ailment that affects the nervous tissue of the eyes. The damage done cannot easily be treated. 
According to Dr. Wijetunge, the conditions of the retinitis infection caused by microorganisms can be cured through antiviral drugs, antibacterial drugs, steroids and even injections. Unfortunately there are no methods of treatment for the incurable conditions of retinitis. 


Keeping retinitis at bay 
As terms of prevention there is not much that can be done except just follow proper care for the eye. Retinitis is a condition that can strike without any warning and it is after examinations that the condition can be diagnosed.
Congenital cases of retinitis can be reduced through careful examinations of a couple before marriage so as to prevent the genetic complications that lead to the disease.
Prevention of marriages between relatives is a helpful step in this. Prevention of AIDS reduces the possibility of the retinitis inflammations from inflicting upon a person. In general maintaining a strong immunity and eating healthy diets will help keep you fit. Consumption of green leafy vegetables and yellow vegetables and fruits will help maintain a healthy eyesight, he concluded.

Sri Lankans dont practice much meditation
	
Ven. Bhikkhuni Visuddhi Theri practices and teaches Dhamma and meditation in the West

Sri Lanka is a place, where the Dhamma teaching of the Buddha still prevails
I sometimes face animosity while walking on the street
My first Dhamma teacher was able to visit our country because we broke away from communism
It is more common that nuns are devoted to social services in the community

Born in Czech Republic and ordained in Sri Lanka Ven. Bhikkhuni Visuddhi is the abbess of Arama Karuna in Prostejov, the Czech Republic. Daily Mirror interviewed this pioneering Bhikkhuni at Sumathipala Na Himi Meditation centre in Kanduboda. This meditation centre is headed by her teacher Ven. Mahanayaka Pemasiri Gampaha Hamuduruwo who is one of the most respected modern meditation teachers in Sri Lanka. Bhikkhuni Visuddhi who was in Sri Lanka for a short visit is a devoted practitioner of metta and satipatthana meditation. She has lived in Sri Lanka for many years and regularly visits the island. She spends most of the time in the Czech Republic in her monastery teaching meditation to adults and children. The following are excerpts of an interview done with Bhikkhuni Visuddhi. 

You were born in the Czech Republic which is a former communist state where one would hardly practice Buddhism. Could you tell us how you first got to know about Buddhism being a Czech citizen
I started practicing when I was fifteen years old. Then Czechoslovakia was still a communist country and it was very hard to find spiritual activities. There was only yoga, which was regarded as a physical exercise, but spirituality was absent. My country has one of the least religious populations in the world. Our people have been historically characterized as tolerant and even indifferent towards religion. Roman Catholicism is the major religion and about 10% of the population practice it. 
I was seeking spirituality and after starting with yoga I studied a little bit of Buddhism. Back then there were not many Buddhist books. I was very impressed with and inspired by Saint Francis of Assisi, Italian Roman Catholic friar, a deacon and a preacher. He stayed in a forest and associated with animals and preferred the natural environment. I wanted to live the same way. I first took to practicing Buddhism when I was twenty years old. My first Dhamma teacher was able to visit our country because we broke away from communism and were making a transition to democracy. 

Are you talking about the Burmese Ven. Rewata Dhamma Sayado
Yes, Ven. Rewata Dhamma Sayado was, at the time, the head of a Buddhist Centre in Birmingham, England. He was a prominent Theravada Buddhist monk and Abhidhamma scholar from Myanmar. He obtained his PhD in 1967 in Varanasi and became a university lecturer and published works in Pali and Hindi. He travelled around Europe to spread the Dhamma and lectured at several universities. He taught Buddhist subjects. The Czech Buddhist Association invited him to the Czech Republic to lead a meditation retreat. I came to the seclusion to practice and learn Dhamma from him. But first, I met him in a public Dhamma talk and I was very impressed with the teaching of the Dhamma. I really understood that this is my path and I found Buddhism through him. He inspired me by his clarity in understanding the Buddhas teaching (Dhamma), by simple and direct speech, compassion, equanimity and non-attachment. To be in his presence and to learn from him was like meeting a true student of the Buddha, who fully accomplished and realized the ultimate truth and became enlightened. 

"I am focusing on educating children to be good human beings, to follow good ethics, have morals, so that they understand what is wholesome (kusala) and what is unwholesome (akusala). By using the Dhamma wisely they get to know what is right and what is wrong through their action"

What kind of Dhamma training did you receive under Ven. Rewata Thera
After I met him, I immediately asked him if I could join his meditation retreat He spoke a lot about practice and focused mainly on meditation, mostly on Satipatthana and the practice of Metta. It was very easy to understand his teachings. Ven. Rewata Thera spoke directly to my heart; very clearly and simply. It was a very big step for me to have such a great teacher and learn Dhamma through him. 

When did you know that you wanted to become a nuniand why did you choose Sri Lanka for that purpose
Ven. Rewata Thera behaved with such ease. I was inspired by how pure he was in his mind and I had never seen anyone with so much compassion before. I came to a conclusion that I wanted to be like him, live the holy life, go this far, become a nun, follow the Buddhas teachings and study. However, it was not possible, at the time, to ordain in my country, since there was no Buddhist monastery. I started a search in other countries and found a nunnery in Germany led by Ayya Khema. I made an appointment and came to her monastery, but there were visa issues that prevented me from staying. I searched more and came to know of another Theravada monastery which was in Switzerland. Since I started living and working in Germany I went to visit the Swiss monastery when I had a free time. This is about the time I entered deeper into my practice. After that I waited another 7 years to ordain. I was 33 then. All this wait was because I took care of my very old grandmother in the Czech Republic. I read about Bhikkhunis in the Tripi<U+1E6D>aka and wanted to be a part of the bhikkhuni lineage and follow the vinaya. Sri Lanka is a place, where the Dhamma teaching of the Buddha still prevails and I think that my past kamma was in Sri Lanka. I decided to ordain here. 

Before that had you ever visited Sri Lanka
I have not been to Sri Lanka before. I read about the history and knew that Sri Lanka has a bhikkhunisa<U+1E45>gha with nuns living in the community. The system allowed me to feel connected and I wanted to meet them and learn. I was excited about seeing the country where Buddhism is alive. I was young and I had just decided to go and see if I can practice Buddhism there. 

When did you start practicing here
After I arrived in 2003, I went to Horana, Olaboduwa where I met several Sinhalese senior bhhikkhunis: Ven. Bhikkhuni Vijitha and Ven. Bhikkhuni Dharshika. Ven. Bhikkhuni Kusuma also lived close by. I was very lucky because my achariya (teacher) Bhikkhuni Vijitha is a teacher of Abhidhamma, Pali and Sanskrit and also a mentor in Pirivena school for young nuns. I received very good guidance and training, which are given to sama<U+1E47>eris. I felt very comfortable with her, so I remained in Olaboduwa under her guidance from 2003 until 2009 and practiced the Dhamma-vinaya. I learned from her how to be a ideal nun, how to wear the robe or how to live peacefully in the community. I received the same education as any local Sri Lankan nun and was trained in; pronunciation (which is important when chanting) and doing Amisa Puja. I also learned the Sinhalese language which was really important to me. 

"I give opportunities to mothers in my arama. Mothers are often omitted and dont have a chance to come for a seclusion and practice as they are busy all the time, so I tell them bring your kids with you"

What kind of work did you engage in after your ordination here (social work etc)
There is a difference in the practice of monks and nuns and also in the expectations of Buddhist laymen in Sri Lanka. The ;ocal people, men and women, come and listen to the Dhamma dana from the monks and raise Dhamma questions. It is more common that nuns are devoted to social services in the community. And it is given due to natural reasons because women are more open to talk about their private and intimate problems with us, nuns. And they come and ask for help for themselves and their families. Therefore at the beginning my monastic life was more focused on helping people from the villages, the poor, sick and those who were suffering. I ordained one year before the Tsunami, and there was also a war going on. 

After the Tsunami you helped a lot of children who were displaced, didnt you
Yes I did. After the Tsunami we were very involved in helping people rebuild their lives and also busy with poor children and the children from an orphanage who had lost their parents. Ven. Bhikkhuni Vijitha determined that I was very natural with kids, so I started giving Dhamma classes and taught in Daham Pasal (Sunday School). While I was living in Sri Lanka, even during the war and Tsunami, I did not have a problem to adapt to the same lifestyle as the other local nuns: they slept on the floor, I slept on the floor, they ate once a day, I did the same. When we had enough rice, we ate more, when we had less rice, we ate less. I never tried to get something from the West, just for me because I have roots there. I was living in the same way and accepted the life of the Sa<U+1E45>gha. I did not keep any back door open thinking I would return to Europe or elsewhere. That was out of question. It was important for me to be a part of the Bhikkhunisa<U+1E45>gha and Sa<U+1E45>ghas problems were also mine, there was no difference between us. We were one community. My Bhikkhunis treated me the same way. 

Currently you are the only Bhikkhuni to run a Buddhist monastery in Czech Republic. How is the situation in other European countries
There is a bhikkhuni monastery in Germany. Just recently they started a bhikkhunisa<U+1E45>gha in Belgium and there is a bhikkhuni monastery in England. There are four maybe five bhikkhunis. We are few. And there are not many senior Theravadabhikkhunis in the world in general, since bhikkhunisa<U+1E45>gha is still very young since its revival. 

How did you find the response of your countrys people to your temple Do you have many followers
Buddhism is not historically common in the Czech Republic. Many local people dont understand the concept of the monastic, how to support them, take care of them and give respect; a behavior that is normally common in Sri Lanka. I sometimes face animosity while walking on the street or misunderstanding in general and therefore there is lack of support.

"Ven. Rewata Thera behaved with such ease. I was inspired by how pure he was in his mind and I had never seen anyone with so much compassion before. I came to a conclusion that I wanted to be like him, live the holy life, go this far, become a nun, follow the Buddhas teachings and study"

Has it in any way helped even a few women in your country
That is the most important part. Thats why I continue to be in the Czech Republic. There is a handful of very loyal yogis; men, women, mothers who have kids, and are very appreciative of having a Dhamma teacher, someone who lives by the Buddha example. With their help we managed to build a new monastery and it took a really long time and it was very hard. We really struggled often to recieve continuous support. Nothing works the same way as in Asia. The positive part is to be surrounded by people who are interested in the Dhamma and really want to practice. I give opportunities to mothers in my arama. Mothers are often omitted and dont have a chance to come for a seclusion and practice as they are busy all the time, so I tell them bring your kids with you and I teach them about the Buddha, both at the same time. Mothers have great potential for progress in Dhamma as they have to learn to let go on a daily basis. But the arama is open to anybody. QLooking at you, they might think they need to be a nun or a Buddhist monk to follow your path, but you should let them know that thats not how it is, its up to you whether you want to join, but to live your day to day life without stress, there are paths to follow. Your comments.
That is also my point. One does not need to choose the path to be a monastic. The Buddha said, if you like the worldly things and if you like the Sa<U+1E41>sara you should be there; have a family, kids. Its only if you dislike Sa<U+1E41>sara, if you are not attached to family, if you dont want to marry, then you can be a monastic and practice in the monastic way. 

Because ultimately what I think is people at some stage will start realising that this is not the real thing, despite you have a family and everything. You can still be unhappy and at the end of it they start following this path. At first they will not realize that this is the way to go, so maybe by addressing that you could probably make progress
This is why we Buddhist monks and nuns teach the Dhamma, not the religion. Religion is something personal. In many cases, one has no choice as to which spiritual path one wants to take. Since you may be born in a religious family you automatically need to follow the same religion. Dhamma is not a religion. Its a philosophy. Its essential to practice at least the five precepts and practice the Dhamma teaching to develop your mind. If the Dhamma can help you to be a better Muslim, Christian, mother or a father then use the Dhamma. Gautama Buddha compared the Dhamma to a medicine for any sickness. If we use the Dhamma as a daily medicine, we can be healed of diseases. One does not need to become a Buddhist, just to take the medicine to be healthy. To become a better human being understand the mind through meditation and Dhamma study. Then one will move away from sorrow and suffering because all these problems, which we have, are because we dont understand the law of kammaand the nature of things. If we understand this, our problems will reduce. By reducing problems we will also be more encouraged to practice. Whether someone wants to ordain or not is a personal decision. When you have a family you cannot ordain and so cant you if you have children and duties. You cannot just run away from them. You need to first fulfill your responsibilities before you can become a monastic. My interest is to bring those people who are interested in the Dhamma and teach them meditation and show them how to lead a happy life.


You are known for your efforts to introduce meditation among children in your country. Do you think that is important and why
As I said, this is also something I was focusing on in Sri Lanka. I used to teach children in a Buddhist Sambodhivihara in Colombo and in my arama in Olaboduwa. I was thinking about how to teach the children in Europe. After I returned to my country the first set who came to me comprised mothers and their kids. They were very interested in the practice of meditation. If you have children, you dont have many chances to go and join meditation courses or visit monasteries in the western countries. They asked me: How long do I need to wait I have another child, so now I need to wait fifteen years until I am able to practice In Sri Lanka I see that in every temple there are children, mothers and other practitioners together. Nobody says that you cannot enter the temple if you have children.
So I was thinking about bringing this practice to Europe and allowing the kids and moms to come to my place and study the Dhamma with me. I started teaching them the way I was used to in Sri Lanka; religious rituals; how to make flowers, how to make offering to the Buddha, how to do chanting and started teaching them the Dhamma and meditation. When I deliver public lectures in the elementary schools, I understand that what is now missing in Czech education is the morality (sila). Most teachers I visited were happy that I am bringing such topic because these days it is not easy for them. Since the children lack morality and dont respect them, they may be rude to the teachers. It is not easy to teach them. Here in Sri Lanka everybody knows the Sigalovadasutta, the children understand how to respect mother and father, how to respect the teacher and how to respect elders. However this is missing today in the western society. And it is a big problem. 
I am focusing on educating children to be good human beings, to follow good ethics, have morals, so that they understand what is wholesome (kusala) and what is unwholesome (akusala). By using the Dhamma wisely they get to know what is right and what is wrong through their action. They also develop the perfections (parami). The little ones are our future, they form the generation which will take over after us. Its very difficult to change minds of adults, but its very easy to correct the mind of a child. If I can make these small kids become better human beings, and make their lives better then it will help change the next generation. Thats why I think it is really important to educate children. 

I heard that you have plans to translate and edit the Majjhima Nikaya into the Czech language. How are you planning to do this
There were already previous translations of suttas of MajjhimaNikaya into Czech language. I started collecting them, doing corrections and editing. We have already published a book which comprises the first fifty Suttas from the MajjhimaNikaya and they are now published in the Czech Republic. I also started doing sutta classes in the Czech language because the older generation does not know perfect English and it is not possible for them to study Tipi<U+1E6D>aka in other languages than in Czech. 

"If I can make these small kids becomebetter human beings, and make their lives better then it will help change the next generation. Thats why I think it is really important to educate children"

What is your message to the Sri Lankan Buddhists and Sri Lankan women, who want to practice more of the Dhamma
I have been able to see because I travel a lot. I noticed that there are these two extremes. In the Western countries people come to Dhamma through meditation courses and Dhamma study classes. So they are well educated in it and are also well developed in the meditation practice. But there is a lack of understanding of the morality, generosity and devotion. It is reflected in the lack of support of monasteries because people dont understand how to take care properly of the monastics. And here in Sri Lanka you can see the opposite: there is a lot of religious faith, a lot of Pujas, people take very good care of monastics and monasteries, they are very kind and generous, but they dont practice much meditation. Their daily lives is more focused on the religious details and one can see that Dhamma here has became more religious than the true Path to attain nibbana (Enlightenment). 
I would encourage the people here to practice more meditation. If you live in another country in the West, there is almost no Dhamma. You see how it is empty, how something is missing. They are missing the spiritual life. Here the Dhamma is prevalent, you can feel it. Tere is a very strong Dhamma culture, but if people dont use what they have theyll lose it. 
My message for the beautiful people in Sri Lanka is, please appreciate The Triple Gem which you have because this is something very rare. This country is very special. I consider Sri Lanka as my home and Ill be very sad if Dhamma disappears from here. We need to protect what we have. This is a real treasure. My message to the people and women in Sri Lanka is to use the Dhamma for the real purpose and learn more about how to practice meditation and implement it into your lives, to attain nibbana and to be free from all suffering. This is what the Buddha taught us. Use Dhamma as a medicine, you will be cured of all illnesses. you cannot just expect to heal your sorrow by offering flowers to Buddha! 

So what you are basically saying is, as the Buddha has preached more than the Amisa Pooja, the Prathipaththi Pooja is more valuable, and one must practice the Dhamma with more Prathipaththi Pooja to be really happy
Prathipaththipuja is very important, but we need to know how to practice it wisely according to the Buddhas teaching. 
In brief, before giving, have a mind that is bright and clear during the offering and be pleased with it once you have made it. This is the best way to make the donation: to be endowed with the three factors you have control over. In Dana Sutta in AnguttaraNikaya the Buddha once taught that there are six factors that affect the merit of an offering, three of which are determined by the givers mind: Monks, the lay woman Velukandaki and Nandas mother, have established a donation endowed with six factors for the community of monks headed by Sariputta and Moggallana. 
And how is a donation endowed with six factors There is the case where there are the three factors of the donor, the three factors of the recipients.
And which are the three factors of the donor There is the case where the donor, before giving, is glad; while giving, his/her mind is bright and clear; and after giving is gratified. These are the three factors of the donor. 
And which are the three factors of the recipients There is the case where the recipients are free of passion or are practicing for the subduing of passion; free of aversion or practicing for the subduing of aversion; and free of delusion or practicing for the subduing of delusion. These are the three factors ofthe recipients.
Such are the three factors of the donor and the three factors of the recipients. And this is how a donation is endowed with six factors.

Surviving the silent killer
	


Although currently there is no cure for Type 1 Diabetes, the Type 2 form-which has the highest prevalence the world, is preventable in through life style alterations

Diabetes Mellitus, simply known as Diabetes, is a chronic disease due to impaired secretion of Insulin from Pancreas which leads to the deregulation of blood glucose levels in our bodies. It is a disease that is rapidly reaching epidemic proportions throughout the world. There are an estimated four million diabetics in Sri Lanka alone and more young people are getting afflicted by the malady on a daily basis. According to the Diabetes Association of Sri Lanka the prevalence of Diabetes in the country has risen from 16 percent in 2009 to 20 percent in 2014 with urban dwellers having a higher prevalence. Its a no brainer that Diabetes has the people of the world in its vice like grip. But what can we do to prevent ourselves from falling victim to this dreadful predicament Read on to
find out.


Types
There are three main forms of Diabetes. The commonest form of Diabetes is Type 2 Diabetes which makes up 90 percent of all cases of this ailment. This form of Diabetes used to be called Adult onset Diabetes or Non-Insulin dependent Diabetes. This was before the discovery of a subset of a form of Diabetes in the younger age group, named Maturity Onset Diabetes of the Young (MODY). It is characterized by Insulin resistance or relative insulin deficiency and is often associated with obesity and lack of exercise. 
The second most prevalent form of Diabetes is Type 1 Diabetes which used to be called Juvenile Onset Diabetes. This happens due to the bodys own immune system attacking the Insulin producing cells in the Pancreas. The reason this occurs is not fully understood, but it leads to little to no insulin production by the pancreatic cells. If people with Type 1 Diabetes have no access to insulin the results could be fatal. 
The third type of Diabetes is known as Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM) which occurs during pregnancy. With the completion of the pregnancy the blood sugar levels revert back to normal, but women who have had GDM, have a higher risk of developing Type 2 Diabetes later on in their life. The complications of Diabetes include elevated risk for Heart Disease and stroke, reduced vision and blindness, kidney disease and increased risk for lower limb amputation.

Treatment and management
Although currently there is no cure for Type 1 Diabetes, the Type 2 form-which has the highest prevalence the world, is preventable in through life style alterations. Of these lifestyle modifications, physical activity still remains one of the main pillars. Elevated physical activity is important in weight reduction and is linked to decreased blood pressure, reduced resting heart rate, increased insulin sensitivity, improved body composition and overall psychological well-being. Thirty minutes of exercise a day can reduce the risk of Type 2 Diabetes by 40 percent! Brisk walking, swimming, cycling and dancing are just some of the ways to do so. 
A well balanced and nutritious diet is essential for health. In Sri Lanka if one takes for consideration a plate where lunch is served, it is abundantly obvious, that we consume a great deal of rice in proportion to vegetables. The trick is to reverse this way of food consumption. By increasing our vegetable intake and reducing the rice consumption we decrease our carbohydrate intake. A healthy diet reduces risk factors associated with cardiovascular diseases. 
Other lifestyle modifications to consider include, quitting smoking. Smoking increases abdominal fat accumulation and promotes insulin resistance. All smokers should be encouraged to quit smoking. However, weight gain is a common side effect when quitting smoking and therefore dietary advice on avoiding weight gain should also be given simultaneously (e.g. managing cravings and withdrawal symptoms by using short bouts of physical activity as a stress-relief activity, rather than eating snacks).
There is also evidence of a link between depression and both diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Women suffering from depression have a 17 percent higher chance of developing Diabetes. Both short (<6h) and long (>9h) sleep durations may be associated with a higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Sleep deprivation may impair the balance of hormones regulating food intake and energy balance. Long sleep durations may be a sign of sleep-disordered breathing or depression and should be treated appropriately. 
Diabetes has almost surpassed all other major illnesses and has altered the lives of many. The increased prevalence of this affliction is also a major burden to a developing country like Sri Lanka. So act now, stay fit and promote healthy lifestyles in others, as you strive to make a difference for a
better tomorrow.

Team sent to bring Udayanga return empty-handed
	
The special seven-member team which was sent to Dubai to bring back formerSri Lankan Ambassador to Russia Udayanga Weeratunga had returned homeempty-handed on Tuesday (13), a senior official of the Financial Crimes Investigation Division (FCID) said.
Speaking to the Daily Mirror,he said the special team comprising officers from the FCID, Criminal Investigation Division (CID), Foreign Ministry (FM), Attorney Generals Department and Department of Immigration and Emigration was sent to Dubai to bring the former ambassador back.
The team had official discussions with the Interpol and later with the Sri Lankan consulate in Dubai before leaving for Abu Dhabi on February 7, the official said.
This was after it was confirmed that Udayanga Weeratunga was residing in Dubai.
It was learnt that the diplomatic passport and another passport belonging to former Ambassador to Russia Udayanga Weeratunga had been suspended and that he would not be permitted to leave Dubai.
Police Spokesman SP Ruwan Gunasekera said he had no concrete information on what had taken place as he had received updates on the activities of the team that was sent to extract the former diplomat only upto the time it left the country but had not been told what happened thereafter.
He told journalists to contact the Foreign Ministry for more information as it involved an international mission.
However, Foreign Affairs Ministry Spokesperson Mahishini Colonne corroborated the views expressed by SP Gunasekera and said it would be better to contact the FCID for inquiry.
Weeratunga was reportedly detained at the Dubai international airport when he tried to leave for the United States, due to a warrant issued for his arrest.
Police want to bring him back to Sri Lanka to face criminal charges over the 2006 MiG fighter jet deal. (Chaturanga Samarawickrama)

## Title: Women, Lupus and Treatment

Women, Lupus and Treatment
	

Lupus in Latin is a name given for wolf. Lupus in medical terms is devoted to a condition that mostly affects females. Starting from skin rashes, hair loss, joint pain and mouth ulcers, Lupus could critically affect even the kidneys and the brain in some. So here is a short article on what lupus is and how to overcome this dreaded disease of the young.

Definition
Lupus, also known as SLE (Systemic Lupus Erythematosus), is a connective tissue disease that affects women nine times more than men. So then comes the question, what connective tissues are As the name implies, connective tissue provides the human body with a connection between organs. This is the Layer or Substrate that Fills in the gaps in our body. Not just filling in, connective tissue suspends the organs, even the tiny blood vessels, nerves and skin. The tissue is responsible for nourishing body components. So imagine a situation where the connective tissue does not do its job in Connecting Then its neighbours which are all vital organs will receive no support nor communication. If I oversimplify things, what affects the connective tissue can affect almost any organ in our body. Connective tissue damage is caused by tiny particles of proteins called antibodies. These antibodies are made by the patient against the patient. 
So why was it called Lupus in the first place During medieval times (5th to 15th century) women who had Lupus were considered evil. This mythical belief was based on the fact that patients had a very prominent rash over the face which resembled the face of a wolf, had epilepsy and that they acted strangely because of the psychiatric conditions that were associated with Lupus.


How do I feel it
Lupus can present in many ways, but fortunately in most patients, it is just a mild disease with joint pain/swelling, skin rashes, mild hair loss and episodes of migraine. Mild disease is easily treatable. There are different types of skin rashes out of which the butterfly rash spreading over cheeks and nasal bridge is the hallmark. Some get a sunlight sensitive ( photo sensitive) skin rash. There is a somewhat circular scarring rash which is given the term discoid lupus. Mouth or even nasal ulcers are also common. 
Joint disease is seen as joint pain (arthralgia) and joint swelling/pain(arthritis). But the joint disease usually does not cause deformities as seen in rheumatoid arthritis. Patients complain of early morning pain and stiffness in joints which gets better as the
day progresses. 
There are some non-specific symptoms that might erupt in Lupus such as fever, extreme tiredness that is present despite not exercising (fatigue), depression, lymph gland swelling, anaemia and weight loss.

In severe disease Lupus can affect vital organs such as the kidney and the nervous system. Kidney damage is called Lupus nephritis. This might even completely destroy the kidneys if left untreated. The nervous system dysfunction can lead to epilepsy, paralysis, numbness and certain types of headaches. Psychiatric conditions are also seen in some patients. 
The heart and lungs are also affected, especially the covering layers of these organs. This might cause sharp stabbing pain during breathing movements and also a dull ache. The pain might vary according to the posture.


Diagnosis
The patient is interviewed first for details regarding symptoms. Then an examination is carried out by the joint specialist/rheumatologist. These tests will provide a tentative diagnosis on how severe the Lupus is. 
ESR, CRP, Full blood count, Urine full report, Serum creatinine are some of the common tests that need to be done. There are also a set of special blood tests which need to be done to diagnose Lupus. ANA (Anti nuclear antibodies) levels and dsDNA ( double stranded DNA) levels are very useful in diagnosing Lupus. Complement levels are useful to assess the severity of Lupus. 
In extraordinary conditions Anti Ro, Anti phospholipid antibodies are done. 
The full blood count is especially useful to determine the number of white cells, platelets and red cells. Anaemia is also diagnosed by measuring the haemoglobin levels. Anaemia can cause breathlessness and tiredness in patients. The causes of anaemia vary among patients. Some reasons are linked to the use of drugs causing stomach ulcers. 
If major organs like the kidneys and the brain are involved, certain methods of imaging like the ultra sound scan and MRI may be used. If there is evidence of lung or heart involvement chest - rays and echo cardiograms are used. 

Treatment
As I explained earlier antibodies cause damage against connective tissue in Lupus. So treatment involves controlling antibodies. The drugs that are used and the doses all depend on how severe one has this disease. 
Sometimes for very mild lupus, where the only thing that is affected is the skin, steroid ointments are sufficient. If there is mild joint and skin involvement, antimalarial drugs are the mainstay in controlling the disease. But regarding moderate to severe lupus, very strong immunosuppressants are used. Steroids, Cyclophosphomide, Azathioprine, Methotrexate are some of these drugs. 
Lupus mainly affects women, especially young women. So we are concerned about drugs and fertility. Also when lupus patients are pregnant there are various issues that need urgent attention. Sometimes certain antibodies can affect the baby within. Therefore its useful for the consultant to inquire into future plans of a young patient. Certain medication should be stopped prior to conceiving
eg  Methotrexate. 
Steroids are used in Lupus to a great extent. Higher doses cause side effects. Sometimes steroid usage cannot be avoided. So we prescribe drugs to counteract steroid side effects. Some common side effects of a high dose of steroids are weight gain, high blood pressure, thin skin, osteoporosis, diabetesand cataract.

Monitoring blood pressure is also useful in Lupus. When kidneys are involved the patients need to control blood pressure -through drugs like Losartan - and stop the loss of protein through urine. 

Useful lifestyle modifications
There are four key facts that I consider vital in any Lupus patient. Leading a stress-free life, stopping smoking, avoiding blazing sunlight and getting treatment for infections are the key facts. Stress is known to flare Lupus and so does all of the above. One need not avoid outdoors during Lupus, but wearing hats and applying sunblock do help. Sunlight has Ultraviolet rays which can trigger pre-existing Lupus. 
There is some evidence to suggest that diets rich in omega 3 fatty acids can help Lupus. Oral contraceptive pills containing oestrogen might lead to problematic Lupus so we advise either progesterone only pills or barrier methods like condoms. 
Exercise is a useful way to control body weight and maintain joint mobility. So we always advice a bit of daily exercise to keep the mind and body healthy. 
I believe that Lupus might have unknowingly existed in Sri Lanka for many centuries. The patients, especially females, might have been ridiculed for their skin appearance, loss of hair, epilepsy and psychiatric conditions. Certain traditional rituals like Thovil and Yaga might have been tried as the last resort to Chase away the demons that reside within the female body. As mythical creatures were the only way of explaining the abnormal phenomena among the young patients at one time. We have now moved from that era to the age of molecular science where early diagnosis guarantees a patient that he/she enjoys anormal lifespan.
