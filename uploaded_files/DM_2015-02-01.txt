Video: Bakers want more to make price cuts
	
	Bakery owners today came up with fresh demands if they were to maintain price cuts for their products as announced in the mini budget of the government on Thursday.
	The All Ceylon Bakery Owners Association (ACBOA) called for the removal of VAT from their products and for the removal of income duty levied from margarine if they were to reduce the price of short-eats by Rs. 5 in accordance with the price reduction of wheat flour.
	ACBOA President M. K. Jayawardene told a news conference that they would be able to come up with a clear price cuts if the government met these demands.
	However, he said ACBOA had informed the bakery owners to reduce the price of short-eats such as fish buns and ordinary buns by at least one rupee from tomorrow.
	Meanwhile, they said that a majority of bakery owners had been compelled to move away from the standard weight of a loaf of bread which was 450 grams and produce loaves which weighed less.
	Some bakers maintain the weight of a loaf at 400g or less because of the high cost, Mr. Jayawardene said. 
	Therefore they called for the introduction of new standard weight of 400g per loaf.
	We have been flexible and had reduced the price of bread by Rs. 6 and given maximum concessions to the people on other products and now we expect the government to do its part so that we will be able to come up with clear price cuts, Mr. Jayawardene said.(YP & DS)WATCH

Customs reveals million rupee textile scam
	
	In a shocking revelation, Sri Lanka Customs said it had unearthed a massive scam of evading millions of rupees as taxes by two BOI Approved companies in the textile industry that had imported over 300 containers during the last few years without paying duty.
	A senior Customs official said that the investigation had been conducted for the past few weeks where the detectives have found that the perpetrators had imported various types of fabrics and garments as raw material to manufacture their end product.
	The two BOI approved companies are based in Kurunegala and the Customs had learnt that they have never exported the manufactured goods back to the respective destinations but had sold within the country.
	The estimated amount of taxes and the loss of revenue to the government because of this violation of BOI regulations, was yet to be ascertained, officials said. 
	The case, which had been investigated for sometime in discreet, was ordered to be exposed to the media on a directive made by the Customs Director General Jagath P Wijeweera due to the magnitude of the scam. (Kevin Kariyawasam)

US hands India evidence linking Pakistan terror
	
The documents handed over by the US to India in connection with the probe into the plot to carry out terror strikes on American and Israeli consulates in the South have established communication between Sakir Hussain, undergoing jail term in the case, and 'Shahjee', a Pakistani national introduced to the accused allegedly by a Pakistani diplomat working in Colombo.
NIA, which has carried out the probe into the conspiracy meticulously, had sent a request under Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty to the US for details from service provider whose email was being used by Hussain to communicate to his handler in Sri Lanka.
Hussain, who pleaded guilty and is at present undergoing jail term in India, was arrested in April last year by sleuths of Intelligence Bureau with Tamil Nadu police while doing reconnaissance of US consulate in Chennai and Israeli consulate in Bangalore to facilitate a terror strike similar to 26/11. For this, two terrorists were to be flown in from Maldives.
Hussain had named Amir Zubair Siddiqui, who was working as Visa Counsellor at Pakistan High Commission based in Colombo till some time back but had to be repatriated to Islamabad after India mounted pressure on Sri Lanka about his alleged activities targeting this country. Pakistan, however, maintains that he was shifted after completing his tenure in Colombo.
During his questioning, Hussain had named one "Shahjee" who was introduced to him by Siddiqui and all the meetings took place in hotels at Colombo. The accused told the investigators that "Shahjee" was described as second-in- command to the Visa Counsellor.
The response provided by US authorities following the request under the MLAT showed that the account was being operated by "Shahjee" who had provided the name while registering with the email account, official sources said.
There have been email communications with some email addresses in Pakistan and even personal account of Siddiqui, the sources said.
The email account is also alleged to have been operated under the Internet Protocol (IP) address of the Pakistan High Commission in Colombo, the sources claimed.
Late last year, the name of "Shahjee" again surfaced after NIA arrested Arun Selvarajan in Chennai and allegedly recovered some incriminating documents including layout plans of country's defence establishment like the Coast Guards complex.
During preliminary interrogation before being sent to judicial custody, Selvarajan, who is also wanted in Sri Lanka for allegedly supporting banned LTTE terror group, told the officials that he had supplied information about some strategic locations to ISI handlers based in Colombo who were allegedly operating from the Pakistan High Commission, the sources said.
Selvarajan again named Siddiqui and "Shahjee" as his handler and said that his business had been in shambles when he was approached by the two Pakistani officials for allegedly carrying out espionage activities in India, the sources said.
Siddiqui and "Shahjee" were not new names for the Intelligence Bureau as they had cropped up earlier in 2012-13 when security agencies picked up one Tameem Ansari, a frequent flier from Trichy to Colombo.
Ansari was arrested after six months of surveillance in 2012. India has already sent its request under Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty (MLAT) in this case to Sri Lankan authorities last year to help in questioning and gathering evidence from the Island nation.
Ansari was a small trader who sent, among other things, potatoes and onions to Sri Lanka. After reverses in business, Ansai came in touch with Haji, a Tamil-speaking Muslim from Colombo who is alleged to have introduced him to Siddiqui in the Pakistan mission in Colombo, and "Shahjee".

Withdraw proposal to send refugees back to SL: MDMK
	
Erstwhile NDA ally MDMK today urged the Centre not to go ahead with the proposal for sending back Sri Lankan Tamil refugees to their country, claiming that the move is aimed at preventing action against the island nation government in the UN Human Rights Council.
"The measures taken to repatriate Sri Lankan Tamils is to prevent action against Sri Lankan government for the alleged human rights violation in United Nations. MDMK urges India to withdraw it proposal to send the refugees to their home towns in Sri Lanka," the Vaiko-led party said in a resolution at its general council meeting in Tuticorin.
Tamil Nadu Chief Minister O Panneerselvam last week urged the Centre to defer the inter-ministerial meeting to discuss repatriation of Lankan Tamil refugees as conditions in Sri Lanka's northeast were not conducive for them to return.
The resolution alleged: "Reports of new Sri Lankan President's visit to India and Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit Sri Lanka in March are only to create a situation favourable to the Sri Lankan government in the Human Rights Council."
Another resolution wanted the Centre to drop the proposed Neutrino Observatory project in Theni District saying it would harm environment and pose a danger to the Mullaiperiyar Dam located nearby.
"By setting up the observatory there will neither be any industrial development nor job creation in Theni district, rather it would only force the people to evacuate their respective places," one of the resolutions passed, said. (India Times)
