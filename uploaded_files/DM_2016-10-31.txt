Economy and leisure poised to grow; mixed sentiment on banking : NDB Securities
	
Pioneer stockbroking and equity research firm NDB Securities (Pvt) Ltd (NDBS) has published three research reports in October.
These reports provide a comprehensive overview of the Sri Lankan economy alongside banking and leisure sector analysis.
These in-depth reviews of the current economic environment and future outlook were compiled by NDBS Research, recently named the countrys best stockbroking equity research team at the CFA Sri Lanka Capital Market Awards 2016.
Scrutiny in detail
Sidath Kalyanaratne, Head of NDBS Research noted, It has been a while since some of these sectors have been scrutinized in such detail.
Sri Lankas external trade is expected to be rather sluggish going forward, in keeping with the world. Some of our major trading partners that used to depend on commodity-driven exports are reshuffling their economic factors whilst some countries are trying to insulate themselves from the external global environment to a certain extent.
Sri Lanka has to meet this frontier with a limited domestic market and a lack of investment capacity internally. The key question is whether opening up our economy further through FTAs and FDIs whilst improving the economic complexity of the export basket along with our geographical location can trump rather gloomy trade and growth outlook externally. These three research reports position themselves at the midst of this juncture, with a critical evaluation of what makes each sector tick.
Aggravating govt. debt burden
Upul Atapattu, the NDBS economic analyst who compiled the report on the economy shared, Sri Lankas unique location combined with peace dividends and improved infrastructure-especially road and data connectivity will prove instrumental for long-term prosperity.
The post war growth momentum was undermined by the negative impact of unbalanced domestic policies and an increasingly difficult external environment. However lack of policy incentive towards private sector participation on development and investments, especially on tradable goods, will have negative consequences in the short term.
Atapattu noted that increasing recurrent expenditure created by the high interest payment from government debt and declining government revenue as a percentage of GDP further has aggravated the government debt burden, adding strain to government fiscal policy. Concessionary loans for Sri Lanka will also reduce making it more costly to borrow - fiscal consolidation is a key concern for the government, which will give policymakers more room to have a balanced policy framework to stimulate sustainable economic growth for the country.
He also added, Ongoing discussions with regards to FTAs with India, China and Singapore alongside a balanced policy framework will help attract FDI and private sector involvement to build a resilient external sector. However, in the short term, we expect economic growth to be challenged by weak global demand for Sri Lankan exports coupled with policy implementation with respect to fiscal consolidation.
Moderate banking sector growth
The banking sector, with its strong correlation to the countrys economy, is expected to exhibit moderate growth in the short term. In the short term we estimate the economy to grow by 5.0 percent, 5.2 percent and 5.4 percent respectively in 2016, 2017 and 2018, commented Assistant Manager - Research Dhinali Peiris.
This expansion will require banks to play a key role in financing expanding corporates and SMEs in particular, so we estimate the banking sector to grow alongside by 15.5 percent, 16.1 percent and 16.7 percent over the same period.
In order to facilitate this growth, banks may need to shift focus from collateral-based lending to cash flow-based lending whilst expanding the virtual banking platform (currently a high banking density compared to peers), shared Peiris.
Currently five banks out of the 25 licensed commercial banks hold more than 70 percent of the total banking sector assets; high competition and additional capital requirements among smaller banks will threaten their return on equity in the long run. We strongly support banking consolidation to strengthen the system and improve banks access to financing via international capital markets. Furthermore, we expect most of the listed counters net interest margins to remain stagnant with banks rebalancing their loan and deposit portfolios.
Long-term growth prospects for leisure sector
The leisure sector is similarly positioned for long term growth, with more robust progress expected in the short term in light of heavy investment in the sector. The sector report uses demand and supply dynamics to gauge their impact on listed hotels (as of 2015 only 27 percent of SLTDA registered rooms are listed in the CSE) whilst also assessing the cost structure in the sector, specifically with regards to construction.
Commenting on the findings, senior analyst Raguram Ramakrishnan noted, From a demand point of view, we expect Sri Lanka to record a 5-year CAGR of 16.5 percent in tourist arrivals from 2015 to 2020 bringing total arrivals to 3.8 million, a conservative estimate in comparison to SLTDAs revised forecast of 4.2 million arrivals.
The estimated average stay in the country is 11.2 days; to meet the estimated demand for 52,000 rooms the sector will need to add over 20,000 to the existing 30,000 rooms.
The industry may also need to account for the steady growth witnessed in unregistered rooms, which can negatively affect profit margins. Significant growth in Chinese arrivals (currently Sri Lanka attracts 0.18 percent of total outbound Chinese tourists) is an encouraging sign for tourism, as the group tends to stay 7-10 days and spend more in comparison to others.
Sri Lanka will need to focus on improving shopping and retail experiences in the country to meet this groups needs, however. Raguram also advised the leisure sector to invest in skilled professionals to meet the service requirements of the growth in this sector. He estimates that 76,000 additional skilled employment will be needed in the hotels and restaurants segment by end of 2020 based on the estimated room requirement.
Overview into each sector
The full reports include a meticulously researched overview into each sector alongside short and long term forecasts. They also offer a glimpse into the listed space in each sector, with analysis of selected key counters.

Sand lorries should be GPS enabled from next year
	
Regulations are to be implemented from next year that will require all lorries transporting sand to be GPS-(Global Positioning System) enabled, Mahaweli Development & Environment Ministry Secretary Udaya R. Seneviratne said today.
He said lorries should be registered with the Geological Survey and Mines Bureau and a valid licence obtained to transport sand and for sand mining.
From January 1, 2017, the Geological Survey and Mines Bureau is to introduce and install a new GPS tracking system for each and every registered lorry. Sand transportation will be restricted only to those lorries that have GPS tracking systems. Those lorries will be monitored by a special team deployed by the Geological Survey and Mines Bureau. The team can monitor the times and locations of sand loading and unloading, and they will be able to note the route taken to the destinations, Mr. Seneviratne said.
Meanwhile, Mr. Seneviratne said a specific time would be implemented from tomorrow for sand mining and transportation within and out of the districts.
He said each and every lorry that transports sand within the district should be of less than three Cubic Meters. Those lorries can transport sand between 6.00 p.m and 6.00 am. The sand mining can be done from 6.00 a.m to 6.00 p.m with a valid permit. Sand mining will not be allowed in the night. There is no restriction to transport sand in lorries of less than three Cubic Meters within the district where sand mining is done, he said.
Permission will be granted to transport sand out of the districts to lorries of more than three Cubic Meters from 6.00 p.m. to 6.00 a.m only, he added.
By introducing these measures the Geological Survey and Mines Bureau hopes to reduce illegal sand mining and transportation in the country and to minimize the environmental damage, Mr. Seneviratne said. (Chaturanga Pradeep and Indika Sri Aravinda)

JHU General Secretary and Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka, in a reference to the Central Bank bond scam, today urged the Government to set up a separate Court specialized in hearing such cases.
He told a news conference that those responsible for the bond scam should be brought to book and the Government had no moral right to sweep it under the carpet.
The Government should introduce a separate court system to investigate such scams if not a separate Court should be allocated for this purpose. Unless wrongdoers are punished, the Government will be stuck in the mud when it comes to economic or social development, he said.
The minister said a special Court should be introduced to investigate and penalize wrongdoers found guilty of crime, fraud and corruption in the past, present and the future and added that the Government had no mandate to cover up such matters. He said the JHU firmly believed that action should be taken against those responsible and added that the law of this country was not applied equally on all citizens but unfortunately some were more equal than others.
The minister said there was no proper coordination among the law enforcing agencies in our country and added that no purpose was served by investigating the fraud and corruption and crimes which had taken place under the former regime if the Central Bank bond scam under the the Yahapalana government was left investigated and hanging in the air.

Seylan Bank 3Q net profit up 8% to cross Rs.1bn mark
	
Seylan Bank PLC increased its net profits for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 (3Q16) 8.08 percent to Rs.1.08 billion from a year ago amid lowering margins and rising bad loans in an increasing interest rate market, the interim results filed with the stock exchange showed.
The earnings per share slightly rose to Rs.3.14 from Rs.2.90 a year ago.
Meanwhile for the nine months, the banking group recorded Rs.8.17 profit per share or Rs.2.82 billion from Rs.7.87 profit per share a year ago, recording a 3.7 percent increase over the previous year.
The bank gave Rs.29.3 billion worth of loans recording a14.7 percent increase in its loans and advances book to Rs.228.1 billion. Rupee overdrafts grew Rs.8.1 billion while the housing loans grew by little under a billion rupees and gold-backed loans grew closer to Rs.600 million. Growth in credit cards was less impressive. The bank has an asset base of Rs.337.6 billion by the end of September, an increase of little under 14 percent over the nine months.
However, the bank saw its asset quality took a slight dent as its gross non-performing loan (NPL) ratio rose to 5.12 percent from 4.68 percent in December 2015.
Seylan Bank is one of the few successful corporate turnaround stories in the banking industry as the bank was able gradually bring down its double digit NPL ratio to closer to industry average levels, which now in fact stands at historically low of 3.0 percent.
The provisions made for possible bad loans in respect of individual customers rose 39 percent Year-on-Year (YoY) to Rs.241.8 million during the quarter while the general provisions rose to Rs.20.6 million from a provision reversal of Rs.221.6 million a year ago.
The deposits grew Rs.26.2 billion or 11.7 percent to Rs.250.7 billion but the low cost deposit base measured by the current and savings accounts (CASA) fell to 33.7 percent by the end of September from 36.3 percent at the beginning of the year.
The bank in July also raised Rs. 5.0 billion in subordinated debentures with 5 and 7 year tenors at between 13- 13.75 percent.
This higher cost of funds made a dent on the banks net interest margin to 4.0 percent from 4.68 percent at the beginning of the year but still higher than the 3.5 percent industry average.
The bank now plans to raise another Rs.8.0 billion in senior debentures in the coming weeks in tenors of three-year and four-year to expand its loan book.
Banks capital adequacy came under pressure due to growth in the risk weighted assets or loans. The Tier I capital adequacy ratio (CAR) stood at 10.26 percent in corresponds to 12.24 percent at the beginning of the year while the Tier II CAR remained unchanged at 12.87 percent between the nine months as the subordinated debenture in July would have cushioned the ratio.
Meanwhile, quite notably the bank recouped its realized and un-realized losses made on its gilt investments during the third quarter as the bank made a net trading gain of Rs.198.4 million against a loss of Rs.204 million a year ago.
The bank further made an un-realized gain of Rs.960.3 million for the quarter against a loss of Rs.699.6 million during the corresponding quarter a year ago.
Seylan was among the banks which were battered heavily by the rising interest rates as its large gilt edged portfolio incurred both realized and marked-to-market losses in previous quarters.
As of September 30, the government held 32.36 percent stake in the bank through Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation Limited, Employees Provident Fund and Bank of Ceylon.
Nanayakkara family controlled 23.42 percent stake through Brown & Company PLC and LOLC Investments Limited.

UNP says prepared to amend laws to recover losses
	
The Government is prepared to amend the existing laws to enable the recovery of losses incurred in the controversial sale of Central Bank bonds, UNP Deputy Minister Eran Wickramaratne said today.
He told a news conference held at Sirikotha that new legislation would be introduced in case the existing laws do not have provisions to recover the losses incurred.
The deputy minister said JVP MP Sunil Handunnetti who heads the parliamentary Committee on Public enterprises (COPE) could refer the bond scam to the CID, FCID or the Bribery commission.
We will support him on this matter," he said adding that further investigations might reveal how Perpetual Treasuries had carried out its activities.
Responding to a statement by former COPE chairman DEW Gunasekara that Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe is also responsible for the scam, the deputy minister said the Prime Minister was in no way responsible for the acts of Central Bank's former Governor Arjun Mahendran though he had appointed him to the post.
If a person appointed to any post by a superior is engaged in stealing coconuts can you blame the superior for that," he asked and added that the Prime Minister had only requested the Central Bank to find an effective way to generate funds for the government and had not advised the ex-governor on the sale of CB bonds.
The deputy minister said the footnotes in the COPE report on the bond scam only referred to the fundamentals of the bond issue and had nothing to do with the transaction in question. (Yohan Perera)
