AG tasked with seizing monies earned illegally
	
The Attorney Generals attention has been drawn to immediately seize the property earned through illegal means from the Central Bank Bond issuance by Perpetual Treasuries Limited (PTL), other companies affiliated to it and other personnel, the Presidents Media Unit (PMD) said.
It said even though the Bond Commission had recommended that civil cases be filed to recover the losses incurred by the government, the Attorney Generals Department would take action to amend the Civil Law procedures as civil cases usually take time to complete. 
To circumvent the envisaged delays, the Commission had recommended to the Attorney General that a Parliament Act should be passed to recover the money owed to the EPF and the Government without violating the Constitution. 
This was discussed at length during a meeting the President had with the Attorney General, Central Bank Governor, Director General of the Bribery Commission and other officials at the Presidential Secretariat yesterday morning.

Having triumphantly completed its first five years in the industry, Arpico Insurance has won the award for the Fastest Growing Life Insurance Company in Sri Lanka for 2017 in its sixth year of operations.
Our company is built on values which are its pillars of strength and the force behind its success. As a growing insurer, we believe that its important to be unequivocally ethical and authentic in all our actions, says Acting Chairman Viville Perera as mentioned in the companys 2016 annual report.
Within a short span of time Arpico Insurance PLC has been able to create a steady competition in the field of insurance for its competitors.

According to statistics, only about 14 percent of the population is said to have obtained life insurance covers and the awareness is now steadily picking up. With September 1st being declared as the National Insurance Day, spreading awareness across the country has positively influenced and the government and the IBSL have been actively involved in this venture.
Arpico Insurance has taken steps to educate people especially in the rural areas spreading awareness about the importance of a life insurance cover. Perera stated that the company has taken initiatives to educate the public in terms of their insurance needs, why they need a life insurance cover and how it can help them.
With the intention of interacting with customers more efficiently, Arpico Insurance has launched a DAV station along with a mobile app, stepping into an extra mile.

CaFFE asks if President still have faith in PM
	
If President Maithripala Sirisena still trusts Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, it means that he has not read the bond commission report, the Campaign for Free and Fair Elections (CaFFE) said on Wednesday.
In a statement, CaFFE Executive Director Rajith Keerthi Tennakoon said the Prime Minister has shown that he relies, not on impartial inquiry and independent investigations when making decisions on important matters but on verbal assurances given to him by his associates.
He said that the report of the PCoI states that 'the question of whether or not the fact that, Mr. Mahendran was not a citizen of Sri Lanka precluded him from being appointed the governor of the CBSL was not a Question of Law. Instead, it was a value judgment, which had to be made by those who considered the wisdom of appointing Mr. Mahendran, who was not a citizen of Sri Lanka, as the Governor of CBSL.
"So it is obvious that the Prime Minister made an erroneous judgment. He made this decision despite the fact that a number of the most senior cabinet ministers had objected to the appointment. The cabinet Spokesperson Minister Rajitha Senaratne continuously states that he opposed the decision until the Prime Minister requested him to trust his judgment and not to intervene in his decisions. The erroneous value judgment of the Prime Minister has cost the nation over Rs. 11 billion," Mr. Tennakoon said quoting the bond report.
He said that the report adds that the confidence which the Prime Minister has placed on Mahendran was misplaced.
The commission states the prudent course of action would have been to independently verify whether 'Mr. Mahendran was honoring the assurances he gave the Prime Minister. We regret that the Hon. Prime Minister did not take this course of action.'
Mr. Tennakoon said the report shows that he was not only mislead by Mahendran but also by a number of other officials.
Is this the kind of person we can continue to have as the Prime Minister of the country This is a man who has made a series of terrible mistakes. Anyone can make mistakes, but these are mistakes that could have been easily avoided because a lot of people were trying to show the Prime Minister what actually transpired. But alas, Mr. Wickremesinghe continues to be stubborn as ever and its up to the President to decide whether he can entrust the management of this country to such a man, he said.

ComBank achieves another first on LankaPay network
	

The Commercial Bank of Ceylon has announced that it has enabled its entire automated teller machine (ATM) network to acquire and process ATM transactions through the EMV (Europay, Mastercard and Visa) integrated circuit, becoming the first ATM Network to be fully EMV compliant in Sri Lanka.
Commercial Bank is also the first bank in Sri Lanka to activate its entire EMV chip card base(Debit and Credit cards) to perform secured EMV transactions through the LankaPay ATM network, making it possible for the Banks own cardholders to securely perform transactions using other bank ATMs connected through the LankaPay network.
EMV is a secured platform to perform ATM and Point-of-Sale (POS) transactions where transaction authentication is performed through the integrated chip, preventing counterfeiting of card data residing in the chip.
Commercial Bank is focussed on technological innovations that deliver meaningful benefits to customers, said Jegan Durairatnam, Managing Director of Commercial Bank. These latest developments are noteworthy because they address a primary concern on transaction security. We have once again demonstrated Commercial Banks superiority in the IT and digital landscape by validating our entire ATM network for EMV compliance on the LankaPay platform.
The Commercial Bank ATM network was already EMV-certified with international card schemes such as MasterCard, Visa and Union Pay.
Durairatnam said the wide spread of Commercial Banks ATM network, currently numbering 756 terminals, and the availability of ATMs at many off-site locations and public locations such as bus stands and railway stations, makes its integration with LankaPay particularly beneficial to the general public.
LankaPay is owned by LankaClear (Pvt) Ltd. which was incorporated in February 2002 as the National Cheque Clearing House, and is today considered the National Payment Infrastructure Provider for the country. Owned by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) and all Licensed Commercial Banks operating in the country, the company offers multiple solutions not only for the banking sector but also across all industries that are ready and willing to adopt/ integrate to the latest digital technology driving Sri Lanka toward an efficient, green, and paperless nation.
Commercial Bank achieved another first with LankaClear two years ago whenit made it possible for users of the Banks Online Banking facility to make instant, real-time transfers of funds from their Commercial Bank accounts to accounts in other banks, via the LankaPay - Common Electronic Fund Transfer Switch (CEFTS).
The Commercial Bank ATM network is the largest owned by a private bank in Sri Lanka, and has over the years set and rewritten many records for cash dispensed during times of national celebrations such as the Sinhala and Tamil New Year and Christmas. Commercial Bank ATMs support the networks of Mastercard, Maestro, Cirrus, Visa, Plus, Amex, UnionPay, Discover and Diners Club, enabling tourists and other visitors to Sri Lanka to withdraw money from their overseas issued cards for spending in the country.
The upgrade of the ATM network to EMV Chip capability means that every Commercial Bank ATM accepts and processes transactions based on Smart Card Integrated Circuit (IC) data as well as magnetic strip data.

Destiny gave Shehan  3 As,  but took his life away
	
By S. Thanthiriarachchi and D. Jayamalie Karunarathne
The death of Shalitha Shehan Dasum shattered the hopes of his parents. The demise of Shehan came as a shock to his parents. He was just 19 years old when he died. The reason for this death was sudden heart failure. The parents to date are distraught over this death. 
Shehan was the son of Krishantha Perera and Lasantha Ranaweera. He had a younger sister named Nethmi. Shehan was an obedient and a lovable child from childhood. He studied up to O/levels at Kalutara Maha Vidyalaya. He was admired by his teachers and schoolmates as an affectionate student. 
He studied from year one at the Kalutara Maha Vidyalaya up to O/Levels. He was involved in many extracurricular activities at the school. He played cricket and was a member of both the junior and senior bands of the college. He was a cadet at school and excelled at the O/Level Examination, said his father. 
It is now three months since the sudden death of Shehan. But his parents still remember how he was fondled by them when he obtained high marks at the examination. Those memories have now faded away. 
He also wishedto become a District Judge or a Magistrate
	In spite of engaging in extracurricular activities at school he never neglected his studies
Dreams of becoming a lawyer 
My son returned home majestically after sitting for the examination his father continued adding, all of us at home were happy. My son always spoke of becoming a lawyer. Later he said that he wanted to enter politics. We never objected. He also wished to become a District Judge or a Magistrate. We admitted him to Royal College for his higher studies and there he joined the cadet troop. He even went to Diyatalawa for training. Shehan loved Art subjects because his aim was to become a lawyer. He loved both of us so much. He also loved his sister. In spite of engaging in extracurricular activities at school he never neglected his studies, said the father. 
The father added that his daughter Nethmie studies at Thakshila College Horana. She too is very good in her studies. I remember the day he returned after sitting for his A levels. He said he is sure of obtaining three As and he would not go to school any more. He had jotted down in his books that he would obtain the highest marks in the island and be among the first 250 students, he said. 
instant death 
On the 25th of September Shehans father as usual had prepared to leave for office. Shehan as usual had risen before 05.15 am and knelt at his fathers feet reciting the Gatha (stanza) which is recited when worshiping a male parent. The father had hugged him in return and left home for work. Shehan had then returned to bed. Within ten minutes after leaving home the father had received a surprise message. The message said that his son had fallen off the bed. Death had come instantly to the boy. An open verdict was given regarding the death. Later it transpired that during the past month a virus had entered his heart. The result was that his heart muscles had been affected. This condition had led to heart failure. 
\When the results of the A Level Examination were released Shehans parents came to know that their son had obtained three A grade passes. Their deceased son Shehan had realised his ambition. But Shehan was not there to share that joy. These parents didnt have a son to embrace and celebrate the results of the examination. 
It is a rare phenomenon that students suffer heart attacks
- Dr. Wijesinghe
Dr. Namal Wijesinghe of Sir Kothalawala Defense Academy said that the possibility of small children suffering from heart attacks is rare. Children may have heart ailments due to various sicknesses, specially due to blood circulation problems. These are very rare occurrences. These conditions may develop in children when they cant adapt to changes in lifestyle. Examples for these changes are eating habits etc. If such food patterns are not changed as they age they can lead to heart ailments.
At present the likelihood of youth becoming heart patients is more. Several decades ago heart ailments were common only among the adults belonging to the age group between 60-80 years. However, trends changed and we saw people belonging to the age group between 40-60 being affected. Presently there is a trend among those who belong to the age group between 25-40 years becoming heart patients. The lives of those who are trying to earn a living are being subject to untimely death due to heart ailments. The main causes behind this kind of death is lack of exercise, questionable eating habits and mental stress that develops in the midst of severe competition,said Dr. Wijesinghe.

Does the Earth really revolve round the Sun Is there proof of what all of us learned from primary s
	
There are several things we learn from primary school in our young age that are almost taken for granted without much questioning. The most amazing things out of those are that the earth is a globe and that the sun does not rotate around the earth but it is the earth which rotates around the sun. These two ideas are the initial persuasion that makes us believe in science over everything else - our own experience, religion, etc. 
Today most of the people believe that the earth rotates round the sun and take it to be an unbreakable absolute truth; a fact. Earth goes around the sun. Its generally accepted, scientifically proved and observed. This is the attitude of the majority of the population. This is where our fundamental education has directed us to. We have no doubt that the earth goes around the sun. 
Hereby, I like to question you. What was the evidence they provided you to make you believe this idea Remember. Remember the time you were in grade one. What was the evidence given Our teachers gave us a lot of evidence to support that the earth is a globe. However, during our entire school career, we were not provided with any evidence by out teachers to the claim that the earth goes around the sun. It is just stated and taken for granted. What a pity. The strongest of beliefs people get from elementary science education is persuaded with no evidence at all. This is in contrast to how the educated people usually denounce the religious for believing in invisible gods without sensory evidence. Can we say that the educated differ from those who believe in gods without providing sensory evidence 
Newton tried to answer this question. He said real motion is the motion with respect to empty space. In other words, the empty space is in absolute rest. Therefore real motion is the motion with respect to the empty space
Domination of Western science in education and all spheres of modern life have made it the newest religion. Someone can argue that there are structural differences between Western Science and religions. Here, I do not want to go that far. However, there is a term, you may have heard that goes as science in popular culture. I reckon science in popular culture is completely a religion. Primary and secondary education, popular books, TV programmes and science fiction are some elements of science in popular culture. It does not consist of experimentation or mathematics in deep. When we consider the Sri Lankan situation most of the educated people in media are only dealing with this popular culture. In this popular culture, the way that scientific ideas are persuaded upon the general public is not through reasoning. It is done through just institutional domination, marketing strategies and psychological tricks. Therefore, most of thoes who disbelieve in supernatural phenomena for the sake of science only does so because it is against the new religion they are following. 
Its time to get back to the topic. Does the earth really rotate around the sun Here the most important word in the above statement is really. When we say the sun does not go around the earth, it means that what we observe every day is just an illusion. What we observe is dependent on how we move. Therefore, when we consider a set of observers looking at a moving object they may observe different motions. Then, all these motions cannot be the real motion. If there exits any real motion, only one of those observations can be correct. Others are just illusions. We, who live on the earth sees the sun going around the earth while an observer on the sun see the earth going around the sun. Different observers may see different motions. The problem is, out of these motions which one is the real motion. 
Hereby, I like to question you. What was the evidence they provided you to make you believe this idea Remember. Remember the time you were in grade one. What was the evidence given Our teachers gave us a lot of evidence to support that the earth is a globe.
Newton tried to answer this question. He said real motion is the motion with respect to empty space. In other words, the empty space is in absolute rest. Therefore real motion is the motion with respect to the empty space. When you hear this idea you will feel that finally Newton successfully solved the problem of what would be the real motion. We, at first glance, tend to think Newton is correct and that the empty space is in absolute rest. But when we carefully analyze, we see that Newtons argument is wrong. Think that you are moving with respect to empty space. Then the empty space should move with respect to you in the opposite direction. What! Empty space moves. There is nothing in the empty space to move. Therefore empty space can neither move nor be in rest in the ordinary sense. There is nothing called moving with respect to an empty space. This argument, originally made by the acclaimed Austrian physicist and philosopher Ernst Mach debunked Newton and his physics. Later Albert Einstein constructed his physics saying that there is no absolute motion. In other words there is no any real motion. Every observer is equal. 
According to Einsteins theory the sun going around the earth and the earth going around the sun are two observations. None is more real, more correct or more preferable over the other. This quote is from one of Einsteins books. 
The struggle, so violent in the early days of science, between the views of Ptolemy and Copernicus would then be quite meaningless. Either C.S. (Coordinate System) could be used with equal justification.
(The Evolution of Physics - A. Einstein, L. Infeld page 224)
Here Ptolemys idea was that the sun goes around the earth while Copernicus said the earth goes around the sun. 
Therefore the two ideas; the sun going around earth and the earth going around the sun are just two observations. None is better than the other.

Govt. has frozen Rs. 12 bn assets of PTL: PM
	
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, in his address to the nation, said the government had frozen the financial assets worth Rs.12 billion of Perpetual Treasuries Ltd, and therefore the Rs.9.2 billion undue profit made by it in the bond transaction could be recovered from it.
He said the government would take steps to implement recommendations made by the Presidential Commission that investigated the controversial bond transaction of the Central Bank.
The Prime Minister said the Commission, in its report, mentioned that Perpetual Treasuries Ltd made an undue profit of Rs.9.2 billon.
However, he said the Central Bank, remaining under his purview, had frozen financial assets worth Rs. 12 billion belonging to PTL. Therefore, he said Rs.9.2 billion that was lost to the state could be recovered.
We will recover this amount. Therefore, there is no loss to the state. If there is any official involved in it, we will implement the law against him accordingly, he said.
He said, We cooperated fully with the investigation since the allegation against the bond scam surfaced. We will take steps for the implementation of the Commissions recommendations. We have been able to prove that ours is a policy-oriented, ethical and pious government. No other government has acted in that manner in the recent past. The judiciary took decisions independently. The media worked fearlessly. Also, we have appointed a committee headed by Minister Tilak Marapana to recommend action if there was any member of the party who is found involved in this transaction. This is the tradition of the UNP.
The Prime Minister said the government was elected to eliminate corruption and frauds in all its manifestations.
He said the allegations of the bond scam came up shortly after the government was formed, but it was not swept under the carpet.
We appointed an investigative committee within two weeks. During the period, the Central Bank governor at the time stayed away from duties. We appointed a member from the opposition as the COPE chairman, he said.

How does a call of nature last for 30 min asks MR
	
While urging the President and ministers not to belittle the post he holds, his predecessor Mahinda Rajapaksa on Thursday wanted to know if it was a bladder or a water tank that President Maithripala Sirisena has to answer a call of nature for 30 minutes.
Minister Rajitha Senaratne on Wednesday said President Sirisena did not storm out of the Cabinet meeting and he had simply gone out to answer a call of nature.
Mr. Rajapaksa said the minister had come up with this ludicrous excuse to cover up the fact that the President had actually been furious and had stormed out of the Cabinet meeting.
There was a drama enacted at a Cabinet meeting held recently. The scriptwriter is unknown. The President has come to the meeting, yelled and then had stormed out. Afterwards, the Prime Minister and other ministers had gone and brought the President back. This is like a boy leaving a house following a fight with his parents and is then brought back in after consoling him.
When asked about this by journalists at the Cabinet briefing, Ministers say the President went out to answer a call of nature. Is it a bladder or the water tank from Colombo that the President has to answer a call of nature for half an hour
The post of President shouldn't be belittled in this manner. When this happens the country and its people also feel they are being belittled, Mr. Rajapaksa explained.
He expressed these views at a Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) election rally held at the Vihara Maha Devi Open Theatre in Colombo on Thursday.
Commenting on the development projects carried out by the previous government in Colombo, Mr. Rajapaksa said their objective had been to elevate Colombo City to higher standards by the time the Port City was completed.
All the development work has been reversed now. Garbage is piling up everywhere. Dengue cases are on the increase. This is why we need to rebuild the city as well as the country soon, he said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

## Title: LG Elections is  sri lanka ready for   change

LG Elections is  sri lanka ready for   change  
	

The Local Government Elections are just around the corner. The LG elections scheduled to take place on February 10 has become a much talked about topic in the country, mainly because of the new electoral system for the polls. Many commended the decision to abolish the preferential voting system and establishing the mixed electoral system. Some have raised objections to the removal of the preferentialvoting system. 
Statistics show that 15.8 million Sri Lankans will be eligible to elect members for 8,346 seats across 341 local authorities. This year (2018) also marks the first time in Sri Lankan history that an election will be held under the mixed electoral system. 
Terance Purasinghe, Senior Lecturer in Political Science at the University of Sri Jayawardenapura, in an interview with the explained about the history of Local Government Structure in Sri Lanka. 

History of Local Government Structure inSri Lanka
Sri Lanka has a long history of Local Government. According to the Mahavamsa the earliest Sinhalese settlements, dating to the 4th century BC, were village based. These villages were used by the Sinhalese kings as a unit of administration, Purasinghe said. 


Sri Lanka has a long history of Local Government. According to the Mahavamsa the earliest Sinhalese settlements, dating to the 4th century BC, were village based. These villages were used by the Sinhalese kings as a unit of administration

He stated that each village was independently administered and village Councils (Gam Sabhas) administered local affairs, addressed peoples grievances and settled minor disputes. The village based administration continued for centuries in one form or the other. 


Under the British rule
The Municipal Councils Ordinance No. 17 of 1865 transferred responsibility for some local administration to local residents.  The Village Communities Ordinance No. 26 of 1871 introduced Village Committees for local administration and Rural Courts for judicial administration. Purasinghe went to say that sanitary Boards Ordinance No. 18 of 1892 created bodies to provide a number of public health services such as electricity, drainage, public conveniences, markets, dairies, laundries and water supply insmall towns. 
The Local Boards Ordinance No. 13 of 1898 created Local Health and Sanitation Boards for larger towns. 
The Urban Councils Ordinance No. 61 of 1939 created Urban Councils in the largest towns in the country. 

Post independence
The Town Councils Ordinance No. 3 of 1946 created Town Councils. The 1979 Tennakoon Commission recommended that District Development Councils (DDC) be established to carry out development functions currently carried out by the Central Government. The District Councils Act No. 35 of 1980 was passed by Parliament and 24 DDCs were created, he said. 
Parliament passed the Pradeshiya Sabha Act No. 15 of 1987 on 15 April 1987 and established Pradeshiya Sabhas. 

Distribution of local authorities by province/district in November 2017
By recent amendment, the mixed voting system (Majority and Proportional) has been introduced for Local Government, Purasinghe said.

Making LG electionsmore local
Dr. Sujata Gamage, a senior policy fellow and leading researcher at LIRNEasia, said the new method is expected to make elections more local by incorporating first-past-the-post (FPP) contests to elect members by wards which are smaller sub-units in a local authority area. 
Comprehensively explaining the new electoral system, she said, The new method is still a proportional representation method because the FPP contests are carried out within a larger proportional representation (PR) framework. The votes received by each Party at the ward level will be totaled to obtain each Partys share of votes in the local authority as a whole. In the Colombo Municipal Council, for example, the larger PR framework has 110 seats. 
Dr. Gamage said the nomination list of each contesting Party should have 66 names as ward candidates and 44 additional names plus three making a total of 113. She stated that if Party A, say, wins 50% of the total votes, it is entitled to 55 of the 110 seats in the council. If the same Party wins 40 out of 66 FPP seats, it has 15 seats remaining from its PR entitlement. The Party secretary will nominate additional members from the list to fill the remaining seats. Similarly, candidates from other Parties get returned according to each Partys PR entitlement. 
In the Colombo Municipal Council or CMC, for example, we have 47 wards returning 66 members. A Ward in Colombo is typically no larger than a Grama Niladhari Division (GND). The number of Members to be returned is higher than the number of wards because there are several multi-member wards in the CMC. Votes will be cast and counted at the ward level. In a dual-member ward, for example, each Party will field two candidates and the Party that obtains the most votes in that ward gets to return both candidates as councilors,said Dr. Gamage. 

Huge increase in number of councilors
The worst part about the new method is the increase in the size of local councils, Dr. Gamage opined. She claimed that the number of councilors in CMC, for example, would increase from 53 in 2015 to 117 in 2018. This amounts to 107% increase! This is what happens when you try to have the PR cake, but get your own representative too, she remarked. 

The number of Members to be returned is higher than the number of wards because there are several multi-member wards in the CMC. Votes will be cast and counted at the ward level. In a dual-member ward, for example, each Party will field two candidates

Secondly, having more councilors will not necessarily make the council more accountable. Thirdly, the new method concentrates much power on the political Parties.
Voters are restricted when voting for the candidates selected by the Party. Additional Members are also hand-picked by the Party,she stated. Meanwhile, she noted that if for some reason an elected Member returned from a particular ward is disqualified, no by-election will be held. 
However, she made an interesting suggestion for the confused citizen. Electoral systems cannot solve all problems. A functioning democracy requires the active participation of citizens, the middle class in particular. Why not join a political Party and try to fix your Party from the bottom she asked. 

Nominationpores, instead ofmanapa pores
In an interview with the Dailly Mirror , National Elections Commission (NEC) Chairman Mahinda Deshapriya said campaigns can be limited to each ward, bringing down campaign costs significantly as candidates contest at ward level in the forthcoming LG elections under the new electoral system. 
Speaking on the controversial decision through which 25% for female representation was given, Deshapriya said out of the total number of members representing a political party at the LG body, the females must constitute 25%. There is a clause which states that if any party obtains only one or two seats, there is no requirement to appoint a female, but if there are three seats, the third member

out of the total number of members representing a political party at the LG body, the females must constitute 25%. There is a clause which states that if any party obtains only one or two seats, there is no requirement to appoint a female, but if there are three seats, the third member must be a female

must be a female. Most importantly, there will not be any manapa pores. Instead, there were nomination pores, he said. 
Deshapriya underscored that each voter will be presented with a ballot paper which is quite simple at the polling booth on February 10th. He said it will consist of a set of party symbols and the names corresponding to the symbols. Names of the candidates will not appear on the ballot. The names of any of the candidates, well-known or not, will not appear on the ballot. Voters will have to vote for the party symbol. Candidates will have to maintain a good image in order to win the hearts of people in their respective electoral.  Asked how the counting and calculation of votes will be done, Deshapriya said votes will be cast and counted at the ward level. In a dual-member ward, for example, each party will field two candidates and the party that obtains the most votes in that ward gets to return both candidates as councilors. 
According to him, the votes received by each party at the ward level will be totaled to obtain each partys share of votes in the local authority in total. 

No party will win the majority
-Hettiarachchi
Executive Director of Peoples Action for Free and Fair Elections (PAFFREL) Rohana Hettiarachchi said, As far I am concerned, preferential voting system should have been there. Under the preferential voting system, people can select their favorite politicians for posts in the local councils. It is the best voting system for a democratic country like Sri Lanka. However, I believe that the concept of respective politicians to be responsible for their own electoral is very good. Ultimately, it is better for the general public. 
Last but not least, the decision to increase female representation is impressive and much needed. We believe corruption and frauds will be reduced when females are in power. Generally females are quite reluctant to engage in corruption and frauds when compared with males in our country. As women are generally good at activities like healthcare, education and cleaning, we, the PAFFREL hope that this change will positively impact the country as a whole. The quality of Government service will rise through their contributions. 
We remember at the 2010 Presidential Elections, there were allegations of computer jilmaat (frauds). As the ballot papers will be counted in the polling stations itself, there will be no space for such activities and even for such allegations to be made. However, I think there will be problems in establishing the sabhas because no party will win the majority. 

Election violationsare zero
- Tennakoon
Executive Director of Campaign for Free and Fair Elections (CaFFE) Rajith Keerthi Tennakoon said, As representatives of elections monitoring teams we are very satisfied with the change. Elections violations are almost zero, which is very impressive. Expenses of candidates, which used to be millions and billions, are very low. Instead of boasting about themselves, they work for the sake of their political parties The candidates are encouraged somewhat and are pushed to work for the people in order to win their hearts. We didnt hear of many incidents regarding the distribution of goods which was a feature of the manapa poraya. Candidates are also totally aware that if they are caught up while violating election rules, they can be unseated as per the regulations. However, we should praise the Government for making the change even after the delay.
said Tennakoon.

President Sirisena should resign- Mahinda Yapa
	
President Maithripala Sirisena did not have had good leadership qualities and therefore should resign from the office, MP Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena said yesterday.
Addressing a news conference, he said that the President had shown his incapability on numerous occasions and had failed in taking crucial decisions.
The President seems to be desperate and heartbroken following the negative remarks that have been made by some UNP members recently, he said.
Moreover, the way he has acted in the Cabinet meeting held on Tuesday was not something he would have done as the Head of a State.
Nevertheless, the decision of President Sirisena to walk out of the Cabinet meeting shows that he is incapable of running even a Cabinet meeting. How can a President handle a country, when he is unable to handle a Cabinet meeting
MP Abeywardena said the only option for President Sirisena was to leave Presidency and resign respectfully without creating further chaos. (Sheain Fernandopulle)

Prez only went to answer a call of nature: I followed him: Rajitha
	
Minister Rajitha Senaratne yesterday dismissed reports that President Maithripala Sirisena had stormed out of the Cabinet meeting and said the President had gone to answer a call of nature and that he had also followed him.
"That was to answer a call of nature. I also followed the President to the washroom," he told the media when journalists asked him about the statement made by President Maithripala Sirisena on the vituperative remarks made by some UNP members before storming out.
All three spokesmen denied anything unusual or untoward happening at the Cabinet meeting.
However, the health minister admitted that Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe gave an undertaking to prevent any member of the party making derogatory remarks about President Sirisena in the future.
The spokesmen said the UNP-SLFP led Yahapalana government was united and strong as ever and would rule the country until 2020.
The dialogue that ensued between ministers and the journalists was as follows:
Daily Mirror: Minister, do you say nothing unusual took place at Tuesdays Cabinet meeting
Minister Senaratne: No. Nothing happened and the Cabinet discussed matters as usual.
DM: Didn't the President make a statement expressing his displeasure on the derogatory and vituperative remarks made by certain UNP members
Minister: Yes, he made a statement, but it was nothing unusual.
DM: Then, are the news reports on this matter that appeared today in the print and electronic media incorrect
Minister: This is what you are saying. Why make a mountain out of a molehill
DM: No, it is a big issue. That is why the print and electronic media had used it as their main news item.
Minister: These things have happened before. During JRs tenure, Prime Minister Premadasa protested against the Indo-Lanka agreement and for bringing the IPKF to Sri Lanka. JR asked Premadasa to leave the government if he disagreed.
DM: If so, why did President Sirisena storm out after he made a speech to the Cabinet
Minister: That was to answer a call of nature. I also followed him to the washroom.
DM: What do you have to say about the insults thrown at the President by MP Marikkar
Minister: It was totally wrong; No one has a right to insult the President or the Prime Minister.
A journalist: What did President say to the ministers at the Cabinet meeting
Minister: No, we cant reveal them. Besides, he told those things to us. Not to you.
Journalist: Was the bond scam discussed at the Cabinet on Tuesday.
Minister: No.
DM: Certain members of the UNP, SLPP and JVP say there will be a new political arrangement after the February 10 LG polls. What is the position of the SLFP
Minister Jayasekara: This is wishful thinking. There will be no change of power or change of regime and the Yahapalana Government will continue up to 2020.
DM: Why these negative comments by SLFP members on the UNP
Minister: You know, the Yahapalana Government is a combination of two rival political parties. They hated each other like Mongoose and Cobra. Today, they are in a coalition government and it is normal that members of the two parties clash sometimes, verbally. (Sandun A Jayasekera)

Standing tall in the  tiny world of philatelists
	
Niroshana Pieris is no ordinary stamp collector. In fact, he doesnt describe himself as one at all. Hes a philatelist with a consummate interest in the history of stamps who attributes his youthful looks to his passion for pieces of paper with pictures on one side and gum on the back. 
His book Muddaraya Eda Ada Saha Heta (The Stamp Then, Now and in Future) is easily the best book of its kind, written by a Sri Lankan author, that I have seen so far. 
His first book, Sri Lanka Muddara Ithihasaya published in 2007 is probably the first comprehensive book on the literature of stamp to come out in Sinhala. This was followed in 2008 by Parisara Wisithuru Mathu Kala Muddara. 
This isnt just about stamp collecting. This book is written with a sweep which covers the history of philately from the inception, in Sri Lanka and worldwide, from Britains Penny Black to Sri Lankas first stamp carrying Queen Victorias image
This third publication, now approved for school libraries by the Ministry of Education, is loaded with detail, but designed in a very readable manner. This isnt just about stamp collecting. This book is written with a sweep which covers the history of philately from the inception, in Sri Lanka and worldwide, from Britains Penny Black to Sri Lankas first stamp carrying Queen Victorias image and valued at six pence. A detailed description of this early postal history of the island and this stamp are given. 
Running concurrently is postal history, from Rowland Hills revolution in postal systems to how the hobby of stamp collecting started worldwide. Members of the British Royal family, among the worlds pioneer stamp collectors, are featured. Sri Lankas postal history, from introducing Asias first mail coach service to building the first post offices and the General Post Office (GPO) in Fort are detailed. Even the cost of constructing the GPO is given. Among Sri Lankas pioneer collectors was Sir Ernest de Silva. The funds to build the Colombo YMBA building came from the sale of a single stamp from Mauritius in his collection. 
A brief bio
Niroshana studied at Ananda Shastralaya, Kotte and followed it up with a diploma in mass communications from the University of Sri Jayawardhanapura. He has worked as a researcher for Sri Lanka Environmental Journalists Association and now works for the Campaign for Free and Fair Elections (CAFFE). 

While at the SLEJA, Niroshana covered a lot of ground for that institutions comprehensive book on Sri Lankas waterfalls, and remarks that the poet Meemana Premathilake and novelist Martin Wickremasinghe could be considered as pioneers of waterfall literature in Sri Lanka. 
He first came across Sri Lankan stamps depicting waterfalls while working on that project. There are two sets of stamps with waterfalls as the theme. Realising the educational potential in stamps, he set out to uncover the story behind each stamp. Its an ideal calling for a self-employed archivist passionate about history, as Niroshana calls himself. 
His life as a philatelist journalist started in 2007, when he wrote an article for the Lankadeepa newspaper on the 150th anniversary of Sri Lankas postage stamps. The history of Sri Lankas philatelic journalism is sketchy at best. Though the countrys philatelic activity is said to have experienced its golden age in the 1960s (like in many other things), the only notable philatelic journalist who comes to mind is the late Francis P. Gunasekara, and there has been no successor till Niroshana threw himself into this neglected subject. 
His life as a philatelist journalist started in 2007, when he wrote an article for the Lankadeepa newspaper on the 150th anniversary of Sri Lankas postage stamps
Society of philatelists
Sri Lankan stamp collecting represents a two-tiered pyramid. The base consists of a large number of hobby collectors, ranging from schoolchildren to adults, who collect without really being aware that philately is actually a science. At the top, one finds a small group of knowledgeable collectors. Unfortunately, they make it sound more like a business investment than a hobby. Some are known to keep collections in air-conditioned rooms and rarely show them to anyone. There is a society of philatelists, but public displays are rarely announced. The Philatelic Bureau too, organises exhibitions periodically, but these are lackluster affairs and Sri Lanka is very much out of the international philatelic mainstream. 
Niroshanas vision is not to have just tens of thousands of stamp collectors or small groups with business interests. He would like to introduce a cerebral approach to the hobby, getting enthusiasts involved with ethnological and cultural angles as well as history and geography. His reading of stamps under the theme of Sigiriya is a good example of this approach. 
Grouped together under this theme are twenty stamps. At first glance, only twelve of them seem to be directly related to the theme, depicting the rock fortress, its famous frescoes, and architectural highlights such as the lions paw staircase. But a careful reading of this theme would show that the remaining eight portray personalities and organizations connected to the theme  from British era archaeologist H. C. P. Bell who discovered the ruins, to archaeological commissioner Dr. Senarath Paranavithana who did so much to interpret its art and graffiti, to World Tourism Day and the 15th gathering of SAARC leaders, all these stamps are related to the theme if one knows the story behind them. 
He first came acrossSri Lankan stamps depicting waterfalls while working on that project. There are two sets of stamps with waterfalls as the theme. Realising the educational potential in stamps, he set out to uncover the story behind each stamp
Niroshana is a frequent visitor to the Sri Lanka Philatelic Bureau to discuss philatelic matters in an unofficial capacity. His dedication to the subject is amazing and hopefully he will achieve his dream of getting enthusiasts not just to buy stamps, but to read and unravel them.

The elders can relax, but can we
	
There are days when I run out of ideas and topics to write on. Those are days I suffer from creative blocks, on account perhaps of drowsiness or the languor that a full stomach tends to invite. All it takes to get out that block is a quick perusal of my bookshelves, a random flip-through of a book Ive just finished reading, but sometimes even that method never works out. Thats when I stray from the usual topics I like to write about and instead read what other writers and bloggers from here have come up with. 
The other day I fell into such a block, and after hours of reading and thinking and still not coming up with anything to ponder on, I decided to browse the web. Browsing through several sites brought me to Malinda Seneviratnes blog and an article he wrote recently, Elders of the world relax, the kids are fine. Rather tellingly titled, I felt. 
The article was basically about how young people prefer to look beyond ethnic and communal rifts when celebrating or protesting a particular course of action taken by authorities, in this case the deforestation underway at Wilpattu. There are those who feel that more important issues are ailing our polity in far more insidious ways and I would be inclined to agree (no one, for instance, talks about the deliberate robberies and thefts from the electorate perpetuated by the leaders that make possible something like Wilpattu), but for the time being lets forget that. Lets instead focus on the crux of Malindas argument: that the young who converged about a month or so back, at the Viharamadevi Park, to campaign against the destruction around the Forest, were far more perceptive about the communal-less-ness (I have invented a term there, I know) of the issue than their elders, who on the one hand were accusing the other of encroaching on their property and on the other reacted defensively to this allegation with the claim that Wilpattu has housed their kind for years. Its an argument that merits scrutiny for more reasons than one. 
The old call the shots. For that reason, what they say of the young in whatever sphere the latter operate in  politics, literature, music, drama, indeed the arts in general  are generally disseminated, promoted, and affirmed by the majority through the press and mass media. The idealism of the committed, who almost always happen to be young, tends to drive me a little crazy for this reason, since I have been conditioned by the old to accept the weariness and the disillusionment that goes with the passing of time: sooner or later, according to these elders, that youthful idealism congeals into its own opposite. This is as true for our young musicians as it is for our young politicians, who creep in with the promise and hope of doing something new, anything new, and to trump the conventional wisdom. They want to rebel by being pop revolutionists. How do they become pop revolutionists By letting go of any desire to be committed to anything. These are the rebels that the sixties and the seventies bred, the flower power youth. We are seeing a resurgence of that flower power youth, here, right now, everywhere. 
Should we be worried Yes and no. I have reason for hope and reason for lament. Before getting to the latter, though, let me come out with my rationale for hope. 
I am sincerely emboldened by the new Youth Spring thats taking the countrys polity by storm, be it the Viharamahadevi Park protest against the destruction in Wilpattu or the countless and frequent protest campaigns conducted against otherwise politically tainted issues like constitutional amendments and the bond issue. These are remarkably less politically motivated than, say, the demonstrations against unfair pay hikes, discrepancies between the private and the public sectors when it comes to medicine and education, and laws and regulations curtailing trade union action. And why Because the latter, regardless of the idealisms of their provocateurs and agents, always turn out to be exercises in protests that are aimed at procuring monopolies and benefits for those provocateurs. The Youth Spring is considerably different, therefore more welcoming. 
What of my reasons for worry Call me conservative, call me outdated, but I simply cant see this Spring as anything to seriously reckon with in the long term. I know some of the people who attended the Viharamahadevi protest and that less than half of the participants come from the Kolombian subset which is satisfied with candle vigils that go nowhere. These youngsters are hence committed, and not to political groups or ideals. 
Regardless of my reservations about what transpired after the January 2015 election, I am encouraged by the fact that the mainstream political parties (well, the UNP more than the UPFA, but lets forget that for the time being here) consciously engaged with the young in a way that left the young in a state of disillusionment after those First 100 Days. Its that sense of disillusionment which helped them become a class of their own, or to be more specific, become committed pop revolutionaries free of old political affiliations. And yet, even with this tide of youthful idealism, I am worried by the fact that it may well be a temporary phenomenon. Its roughly the same story in other countries. 
The old call the shots. For that reason, what they say of the young in whatever sphere the latter operate in  politics, literature, music, drama, indeed the arts in general  are generally disseminated, promoted, and affirmed by the majority

And its also roughly the same story in the arts. If we have never progressed beyond the old masters  in the cinema, in music, in dance and drama  its because theres always a disjuncture between the young rebels desire to defy what those masters did and the material needed to validate that act of defiance. When a particularly ambitious young singer lampoons the personal life of an established musician, he gets crucified, not by the old, but by the young (the reactions and comments that such works of art glean from his fan base indicate this only too well), and when another ambitious young singer sidelines another master with the remark that there are better singers from his age, he gets crucified again by the young. You see the point I am making here: pop revolutionaries, no matter how zealous they may be, dont seem to have what it takes to transform defiance into cohesive action plans. Thats the contradiction at the heart of our youth today. 
Are our youngsters disconnected from their surroundings The old seem to think so.
The last few years, however, have taught me otherwise. They may appear to be indifferent and informal (they have progressed in the way they address elders, because to them everyone is an aiya, an uncle, an auntie) but that is because they believe they know everything, so much so that they are willing to look beyond problems and realities to make way for their own solutions. To them, hence, the problems of destruction and deforestation at Wilpattu are a sign of political apathy, and not racial discord. To me those problems are remarkably and unfortunately different, because racial discord has become a living, material reality: no one can escape it, and no one can ignore it. But the allegation that this indifference to such discord makes the young uprooted from their reality is, at best, misconceived and a result of what we, the elders, think to be the correct attitude to such problems. The young are not disconnected, they are not indifferent. 
I rarely write about the young to this paper because I too, because of my conservative streak, believe that theres nothing serious to write about when it comes to them. But that doesnt mean I havent written on them at all: the various events that school clubs and societies organise, the music concerts, the photographic exhibitions, the book stalls and quiz competitions, I have gone through in this newspaper. These are all handled by a demographic that has, thanks to social media, and to the multiplicity of voices (never constant, always on the move) that YouTube and the blogosphere has brought about, is becoming more powerful in the country. These youngsters, from that demographic, are supremely confident of what they believe in. They may be erroneous, fundamentally wrong in their assumptions, but I feel that their beliefs are to be welcomed. 
Ive had the pleasure of meeting schoolchildren who dabble in poetry in ways that trump and stimulate my imagination. Ive had the pleasure of meeting schoolchildren who listen silently and reverently to elders who chastise them and then succinctly point out where they are wrong, often to their faces, if not to me. They have become emboldened by a false consciousness of their own strength. A false consciousness, because its buttressed by what they read, often do, but all too often engage in online. The internet and social media have democratised opinion, so when youngsters come across those opinions, they tend to be suave and smug, thinking they know everything they need to know. This attitude of being overconfident can in the long term be its own descent, but I see, particularly in those who can be referred to as street-smart and book-smart (i.e. those who think and do at the same time), a new hope for the future. They are friendly, ever eager to accommodate, but they can also get testy and sceptical when they are questioned unfairly. 
So yes, perhaps Malinda was right. Perhaps the elders should be relaxing. Perhaps they already are. Either way, we get the point: however smug and smart they (think they) are, the young can carve a different part, one free of political and communal parameters.

There was a pop, but no fizz!
	
Sri Lankan women who were elated at the lifting of the ban that prohibited liquor sales to females now see the decision reversed and have to look to a male to buy them a drink
When can Sri Lanka introduce a policy and stick with it The recent reversing of the decision taken by the Government of Sri Lanka (GoSL) to allow certain liberties to women in their dealings with alcohol has stirred a hornets nest. On one side it questions the decision making ability of the Government which can be best described as someone who does things andlater thinks aboutthe repercussions.
On the other hand the president gives the picture that he came to know of these historic decisions taken by the GoSL only through what he read in the newspapers. Its natural that the president was angered by this decision regarding women and liquor sales because he initiates an anti-alcohol campaign. 
The association between women and alcohol has not only existed for many centuries. Latest research reveals that women are closing the gap with men in both recreational consumption and in the number and rate of problems associatedwith drinking. 
Seeking social status
The fact is that more and more women are taking to alcohol for social status rather than as a stress buster. Writer Kristi Coultier writes that the idea of a modern urban women means to be a serious drinker. Recently I attended a party in Kandana. Three women at the same table I sat at ordered hard liquor, but only one was able to finish the contents in the glass. This seems to be the trend in Colombo and in most areas which are known to attract tourists. In fact the GoSL lifted the ban which prevented women from purchasing alcohol to create gender equality and most importantly promote tourism. 
There is a cross section of the society which thinks that its okay for women to drink, given their ability to endure anything. Women unlike men have more control over their emotions and senses.
It is known that most Sri Lankans are influenced by public perception in their decision making and dont really follow what their inner-selves tell them. The other factors that greatly influence them or bound them are Buddhist norms. But within a good number of women there is this need to down a few shots of liquor, but they are held back by what others think of them. 
Some women were experiencing a volcano within which was the need to have a drink. This need could have bubbled to the surface with the initial lifting of the ban. But it all turned into an anticlimax when the GoSl reversed its decision. Its important to know how women will take the reversing of this decision. Many believe that women have been taken for granted and they will just grin and bear this disappointment too. But some say that the time to think seriously is when a battered or disappointed woman is silent. What would most women who welcomed the lifting of the ban do now 
More control over their senses
There is a cross section of the society which thinks that its okay for women to drink, given their ability to endure anything. Women unlike men have more control over their emotions and senses. The Sri Lanka culture has been such that it has always underestimated the status, ability and needs of women for centuries. 
World Health Organization (WHO) records showed that 80.5 % of women never drank compared to 56.9 % of men who never touched alcohol. The increase in the consumption of alcohol by women dates back to World War 11. Its said that this was due to women having to play roles that were usually designed for men. 
But the health sector warns that women can develop liver damage and other alcohol related health problems quicker than men, even if they drink a lot less than males. 
Official guidelines in the UK for drinking specify that the adult should not consume more than 14 units of alcohol per week. WHO defines drinking heavy when an adult consumes more than 5.7 units of alcohol during a single occasion.  When one probes the alcohol records in Sri Lanka and takes women as a whole, we havent reached a Public Health Crisis like in the US. Sri Lanka being unable to retain the lifting of the ban on liquor sales to women seems to have come as a blessing in disguise. The law passed in 1955 which specifies the rules regarding the sale of liquor to women still stands, as of now. 
The women who want to drink can get their men to buy them a bottle, a pint or dram of their favourite liquor. The problem was created because someone in the GoSL wanted to make a questionable habit like females consuming liquor very official. The relationship that men and women have with alcohol will continue till drinking becomes meaningless. Dropping the bottle must come with understanding that these pleasures are temporary, not because a battered liver screams at you to stop!
