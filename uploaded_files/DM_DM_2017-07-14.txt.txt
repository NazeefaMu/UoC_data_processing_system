Number 5 person Judge him by the company he keeps!
	


The qualities and symbols represented by Number 5 provides the clue to identifying the 5 person.
Number 5 represents freedom, independence, adolescence, struggle and defiance of tradition and orthodox beliefs, journeys, fire, ether and red.

Qualities opposite those of Number 4 person
We know that Number 4 represents organization. Number 5 which represents qualities just opposite those of Number 4 rules: disintegration, disorganization and instability.

Inconsistent and volatile
Number 5 person has nothing stable. He is inconsistent. His happiness changes to sadness in a moment. What Number 5 person firmly and vociferously maintains today would deny or reject tomorrow.
Number 5 is the union of 2, a female number and 3, a male number. Here comes the sexual implication.

Mercury represents Number 5
Mercury is the planet that represents Number 5. Mercury is a volatile planet which quickly absorbs the qualities of the planet it associates with. When it associates with a benefic planet like Jupiter it would manifest the qualities of Jupiter  intelligence, fairness, righteousness, high learning, altruism etc.
Mercury would show qualities such as crookedness, artfulness, slyness, infidelity and dishonesty when he is associated with a malefic planet like Mars.
Similarly, a good Number 5 person would manifest qualities of Mercury conjunct with Jupiter and a bad Number 5 people would be what Mercury is when he is thrown together with a malefic like Mars. 
Number 5 person is full of vitality and he is very active. What he manifests is momentary energy, not static or stable energy.
Number 5 person achieves success resulting from the execution of his plans and strategies.

Versatile
According to Numerologists, the positive aspect of Number 5 person represents versatility, the capacity for change for the better, travel, gainful travel, and efficient management.
The negative aspect represents indecision, irresponsibility and constant changeability.

Prolific writers
Number 5 people are sociable and easily make friends. They have a propensity to try their luck in horse racing and other gaming activity. They make prolific writers.
Number 5 people would manifest more positive qualities if born on a Wednesday at the planetary hour of Mercury on the 5th, 14th, or 23rd of the month particularly between June 15 and July 16 or between September 17 and October 17.

Obama back in political fray with Democratic fundraiser
	

WASHINGTON AFP July13, 2017- Barack Obama headlines a key Democratic fundraiser Thursday in one of his first major appearances for the party since Donald Trump succeeded him as US president in January. 
Obama will attend a fundraiser for the National Democratic Redistricting Committee (NDRC) at a private home in the US capital Washington. 
The event, which is closed to the press, aims to raise money to fund the coming electoral battles next year in a bid to control the redistricting effort that is scheduled to take place after the 2020 census. 
Local legislatures, and not the federal government or the US Congress, redraw these boundaries. 
Republicans currently control the legislatures in 32 of the nations50 states. 
Restoring fairness to our democracy by advocating for fairer, more inclusive district maps around the country is a priority for president Obama, his spokesman Kevin Lewis said in a statement.

Orient Finance goes from strength to strength
	
Orient Finance PLC, which is a licensed finance company, has recorded a remarkable achievement at a time it celebrated 35 years in operation. The company was able to record the highest ever total income of Rs.3.3 billion during the financial year ended March 31, 2017 achieving 40 percent growth over the last financial year. This is a remarkable achievement amidst tough macroeconomic factors. This was supported by the increase of net lending portfolio by 18.6 percent to record as Rs.16.4 billion by the year end.
The net interest income also grew by 14 percent recording Rs.1.29 billion net interest income. The growth of the net interest income is lesser than the total income growth rate due to the narrowed margin owing to the increase of market interest rates during the year.
The company has recorded profit before tax of Rs.301 million even though the borrowing rates were higher than the previous year. The company was able to maintain its overhead costs with a marginal increase and the provision for impairment is lesser than the previous year. Orient is within the first 15 in terms of total assets amongst the licensed finance companies. The company has smoothly transitioned into normal operations after the consolidation took place two year ago. Total assets of the company stood at Rs.19.4 billion while the total deposits from customers was recorded as Rs.9.6 billion, up from Rs.9.2 billion in the previous year.
The company signed several memorandums of understanding (MoUs) with vehicle agents and dealers to ensure guaranteed business and many joint marketing campaigns were launched including in the Middle East. This has resulted positive results, which is evidenced by the increased portfolio.
The company has an islandwide branch network comprising 30 business centres and most of these are outside the Western Province. The companys product range includes leasing, fixed deposits and savings, business loans, debt factoring and pawning.
Commenting on the overall results of the company, Chairman Dr. Dayanath Jayasuriya PC went on to say that the strategic initiatives taken by the company have resulted in the commendable growth of its revenue surpassing Rs.3 billion and marketing strategies have led to an increase in its lending portfolio and fixed deposit base despite unfavourable macroeconomic factors.
CEO Mayura Fernando stated that the company plans to further expand its business operations over the next few years whilst increasing the customer focus and adding more value to its customer base in terms of product features and service excellence.

Former Treasury secretary Dr. P. B. Jayasundera, former Co-operatives and Internal Trade Ministry secretary, former deputy secretary to the Treasury and Lanka Sathosa ex-chairman were summoned by the PRECIFAC today in connection with a loss of Rs.136 million incurred by the state in 2014.
A PRECIFAC spokesman said they received a petition saying that the government had incurred a loss of about Rs.136 million by purchasing big onions from local farmers at a higher rate of Rs.90 against the Cabinet decision which proposed to purchase them at a rate of Rs.60.
He said according to the petition, more than 4.5 million kg of big onions had been purchased from the local farmers at a higher rate against the Cabinet decision in 2014 to get political advantage for the presidential election campaign of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa. (Ajith Siriwardana)

What markings on Mounts indicate
	
Human Hand - Trailblazer of Human Civilization -Part 17

BY A.S. Fernando.
Each planet has its strong and weak aspects. A well- developed mount with good markings shows its strength. Grilles, cross bars, islands and crosses weaken the good effects of a mount. A vertical line adds strength to any mount. In some hands, all mounts are found equally developed without bad signs. Such hands indicate a well-balanced character endowed with good qualities derived from all mounts. Owners of such hands are even-tempered, broad-minded, amiable persons who hold positions of eminence and prominence in society. If there are only two well developed mounts, the subject would possess a combination of qualities germane to the two mounts. In such a case, the mount redder than the other with a clear vertical line should be considered the stronger one.
In all cases, a mount should be read together with its finger. The qualities as signified by the length, smoothness or knottiness, type of the tip and the nail of the finger should be carefully harmonized with those of the mount in making predictions. Such a synthesis would bring forth the health defects of the subject.

Mount of Jupiter
A strong red line on the Mount of Jupiter between the first and second fingers indicates the weakness of intestines. A single vertical line on this Mount as on any other mount, adds to the strength of the mount. It is a line of success.
Two vertical lines on the mount show failure in achieving the target due to wavering between two goals.
A line crossing a branch of Line of Heart below signifies a disappointment in a love relationship. Crossed hair lines on the Mount indicate a head injury.
Star, circle, triangle, square, trident, and single vertical line add strength to the mount. Grille, cross bar, island, horizontal lines, dot or cross point to defects in health and character. A cross on the mount signifies success in marriage. A triangle on the Mount shows that the subject is a clever politician.
Health troubles include biliousness, rheumatism, nerves, hemorrhoids, varicose veins, ear troubles, predisposition to suicidal pessimism.

Mount of Apollo or Sun
The markings which add strength to this Mount singly or in combination are the star, triangle, square, trident or the single vertical line.
A single deep and straight line on this mount signifies wealth or fame or both and the subject pursues one single career during his life time.
Two lines mean real talent, but the full potential is not exploited. A sister line of the Sun Line portends great success.
Many confused lines show that inspiration has stopped short of realization of the goals. A spot on the mount means the danger of losing reputation. A star on the mount with a good Line of Sun assures fame as a genius. A square on the mount foretells great financial success. A circle on the mount brings the subject much fame. A triangle on it means high honours in the field of arts.
Health troubles indicated by bad signs are weak eyes, heart trouble, sunstroke and fever.

Abduction, torture of Tamils remain systematic: ITJP
	
Abduction and torture of Tamils by the Sri Lankan security forces remain systematic because in 30 months the new Government has failed to dismantle the networks of the deep state, a Johannesburg-based, the International Truth and Justice Project (ITJP) said in its latest report.
This includes torture chambers in one of the countrys largest army camps, immigration fraud, human smuggling and extortion by government allies, the report stated.
It is hardly surprising that Sri Lankas white van abductions continue as those in charge of past system crimes have been promoted and rewarded by this Government, which reassures perpetrators that they will never be held accountable, said the ITJPs Executive Director, Yasmin Sooka. In addition, torturing Tamils has become a highly lucrative business, she added.
The ITJP comprises prosecutors and lawyers whove worked on international tribunals, UN commissions and the ICC. Its findings are reinforced by medical NGOs and doctors who do painstaking work forensically examining the scars of torture survivors.
For its latest report the ITJP took detailed testimony from 57 Tamil victims of illegal detention and torture under the Sirisena government -- 24 of them tortured in 2016 or 2017. No official has been investigated or held accountable for such torture.
The ITJPs report, Unstopped, indicates that the ongoing torture is not the conduct of a few rotten apples in the Sri Lankan security forces as it includes senior officers who themselves participate in the torture which is systematic and condoned
The ITJPs report provides graphic descriptions of the torture methods used in 2016/17, which include beating with cricket wickets and pipes, burning with cigarettes and branding with hot metal rods, asphixiation and hanging upside down. In addition, 18 victims (15 male) described experiencing sexual violence.
Its hard to convey the extent of the sexual depravity and cruelty of the perpetrators, said Ms Sooka, whats clear is any security sector reform in Sri Lanka must ensure that officials responsible for these grave crimes are held criminally accountable.

- In a third of cases in 2016/17 senior officers are described entering the torture chamber, indicating knowledge on the part of those in command.
- 12 victims in 2016/17 heard other prisoners screaming from their solitary cells, indicating
(a) More people were tortured and
(b) All the security personel present at the site would have had knowledge of the torture.
- Biometric fingerprinting has been used in the torture chambers, technology that was only recently introduced for passports. Organised crime would be unlikely to use this or want to fingerprint in the first place.
- Victims describe being asked questions about information given during previous interrogations that was not widely known, indicating those involved in torture now have access to a centralised database of past interrogation records.
- 8 victims describe some of their perpetrators wearing military uniforms.
- In 7 cases the victim was tortured in a known site - the Vanni Security Force Headquarters (also known as Joseph Camp).
- Victims are held in purpose built cells and tortured in rooms already equipped for torture.
- The abductions, release and detentions follow a similar modus operandi as during the Rajapaksa years.
- Reprisals continue against family members after the victim has fled.

As Palestinian leaders fight over Gaza, Israel worries Hamas will go to war
	
By William Booth and Hazem Balousha 
Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas is pursuing a high-risk campaign in the Gaza Strip to squeeze his own people so hard that they might force the Islamist militant movement Hamas to surrender control of the isolated coastal enclave. 
The 82-year-old leaders Palestinian Authority, which runs the West Bank but has only limited sway in Gaza, has slashed salaries for its employees in the seaside territory, withheld permissions for medical patients to leave and, in its most dramatic step, cut payments for the electricity provided to Gaza by Israel. 
Israel fears Hamas might lash out with rocket fire, and the World Bank worries the strip could collapse. The United Nations on Tuesday declared that a decade of Hamas rule, Palestinian infighting and crippling blockades by Israel and Egypt have made life for people in Gaza more and more wretched each day. 
But Abbas has said he is prepared to go even further, threatening to impose sanctions against Hamas and freeze funds for its leaders according to an interview he gave to Asharq Al-Awsat newspaper.

Asia/Pacific Group on Money Laundering to hold 20th Annual Meeting in Colombo
	
The 20th Annual Meeting of the Asia/Pacific Group on Money Laundering will be held in Colombo during July 17-21, 2017 with the participation of about 450 local and foreign delegates from 41 member countries and several international observer organisations.
This event will be graced by President Maithripala Sirisena as the chief guest.
The Asia/Pacific Group on Money Laundering, more commonly known as the APG, was founded in Bangkok, Thailand in 1997, initially by 13 countries including Sri Lanka. The APG is the regional body tasked with the monitoring of the effective implementation and enforcement of internationally accepted standards against money laundering and the financing of terrorism, in particular, the 40 Recommendations of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) within member countries. Currently, the APG has a varied membership consisting of small economies in the Pacific to the largest economies in the world such as the United States, China, Japan and India. In addition to its permanent member countries, this years APG Annual Meeting will be attended by a number of international and regional observers such as the FATF, International Monetary Fund, World Bank, Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), Asian Development Bank (ADB) and Egmont Group of Financial Intelligence Units.
The APG, as the largest FATF-styled Regional Body (FSRB) in the world, plays a pivotal role in the ever-changing global landscape of Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Countering Financing of Terrorism (CFT). In the context of the revamped version of 40 Recommendations adopted by the FATF in 2012, the APG, through its Mutual Evaluations of member countries, assesses AML/CFT compliance vis-a-vis, a wide range of preventive measures, institutional requirements, enforcement and prosecution issues, sectoral controls and obligations to achieve mutual legal assistance and international cooperation to freeze and confiscate criminal proceeds. Apart from Mutual Evaluations, the APG also supports its members by providing technical assistance and training in particular and typologies research to better inform APG members and the public regarding Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing trends, methods, risks and vulnerabilities.
The APG also assists its members to establish national coordination mechanisms to better utilise resources to combat money laundering and terrorist financing.
The 20th Annual Meeting will be useful for member countries to strengthen international cooperation, review AML/CFT compliance levels and adopt actions to address AML/CFT weaknesses. The Annual Meeting will be especially significant to Sri Lanka, as Sri Lanka becomes the APG Co-chair for the years 2016-2018 while the country can further show its commitment to implement actions to achieve international AML/CFT standards.

Battle Against Dengu
	
With dengue mosquitoes wreaking havoc in the lives of patients, it has become a tedious task in todays context to curtail the escalation of dengue mosquitoes in the environment. Despite the numerous Shramadana efforts and dengue awareness programmes being carried out countrywide, mitigating the dengue menace completely would be a dream come true. Since Prevention is better than cure,Dailymirrorhighlights a number of practical and effective, preventive measures to eradicate the mosquito menace as indicated by several experts.

An inventor comes up with a solution
According to the World Health Organization, the incidence of dengue has grown dramatically around the world in recent decades. The organizations reports on the disease revealed that the actual numbers of dengue cases is under reported and many cases are misclassified. 
One recent estimate indicates 390 million dengue infections per year of which 96 million manifest clinically. Another study, of the prevalence of dengue, estimates that 3.9 billion people, in 128 countries, are at risk of infection with dengue viruses. The year 2016 was characterized by large dengue outbreaks worldwide. Its clear that the dengue is an epidemic beyond simple means of control, not only in Sri Lanka. 
Former Deputy General Manager of the Ceylon Steel Corporation, Engineer Sarath Jayakuru is an inventor with a vision to rid the country of the disastrous dengue epidemic. His invention, a simple mosquito trap won the Presidential Merit Award in 2001. However he laments that the simple, cheap and easy-to-make equipment that could have greatly alleviated households of this burden, has been ignored over the past 17 years. With the exception of a doctor from Kurunegala who endeavoured to make use of this invention in every school and household, the attention his mosquito trap received has been insignificant. My invention isnt profitable, but practical, he adds. He shared his thoughts and innovative ideas with the Dailymirror, with the hope that health authorities, will take due notice and take his fresh approach forward in battling the deadly disease. 
So far the key theme in tackling this menace is based on a seek and destroy approach of breeding places. This is no easy task and not practicable in sustaining over long periods. It seems that approach alone isnt effective, since dengue has risen to epidemic proportions and therefore needs more attacking fronts, Jayakuru said. 
He lists out some logical ideas in the control of the disease, both short term (ST) and long term (LT) for serious consideration of those in authority, bold enough to think afresh and act differently. 
1)The first priority should be to prevent mosquitoes biting the infected patient either by isolation, covering with a net or applying a repellent lotion to the exposed parts of the body. A dengue patient is the real source of spreading the disease and not the mosquito as most people tend to believe. It only transports the virus to a healthy person. Netting used to cover bed etc, should be made duty- free, affordable and even given free to families with infants, as long term solutions. Making nets would be an added income to the rural folks and a double bonus to society. Repellents are presently very expensive and should be made duty-free or inexpensive. Citronella oil, camphor oil etc. should be given free to school children in affected areas. (ST) 
One recent estimate indicates 390 million dengue infections per year of which 96 million manifest clinically. Another study, of the prevalence of dengue, estimates that 3.9 billion people, in 128 countries, are at risk of infection with dengue viruses
2)Fogging is a short term solution. However, this is disastrous to the eco-system even destroying the mosquitos natural enemy, the dragonfly. They are hardly seen at present unlike in the 60s and 70s when mosquitoes were not an issue. Now that the damage is done, it should be carried out on 4 to 5 consecutive days to completely wipe out the new mosquitoes that generate at various stages, from larvae left behind in the area. There is no sense in fogging just for one day since larvae are not affected. 
3)Release of Dragonflies to the environment is a long term solution as they are the natural enemies of mosquitoes, in both adult and larvae stages. They are harmless to humans and should be specially propagated in large numbers and released. Once established, fumigation (fogging) should not be done. 
4)Island-wide usage of the Mosquito (larvae) Trap (LT). This is a device that costs nothing which destroys the larvae indefinitely, with minimum of attention. According to Sarath Jayakuru, the viability of his invention is that it can be left unattended for prolonged periods, except in the case of traps kept inside houses which would have to be refilled occasionally to make up for evaporation. As for traps kept outside, they can be allowed to fill with rainwater, having been screened with a mesh. 
5)Controlled killing of larvae, a short term approach involves keeping troughs of water in the open for mosquitoes to lay eggs. These troughs must be replaced with fresh water once a week on a particular day, eg: Monday, to make it a regular habit. The purpose of this is to destroy new generations of mosquitoes and also to prevent them from flying 2 to 3 km per day, in search of breeding places while spreading the disease in that radius . However Jayakuru opines that his invention the mosquito trap is a safer alternative. 
6)Release of Oxitec re-engineered mosquitoes is another short term alternative. These are male mosquitoes produced by the million by Oxitec a company developed by Oxford University and presently owned by a US company. The male mosquito mates with the dengue mosquito (Aedes Aegypti) to produce larvae that do not survive. Field trials done by Bill Gates Foundation and University of Sao Paulo in Camen Island and Brazil respectively, resulted in 80 to 95% reduction in mosquito population in 11 weeks. Successful trials have been done in Malaysia, Panama and in Florida in 2016. Hadyn Parry re-engineered mosquitoes to fight diseases on Youtube is a useful TED talk on the subject. Also searchOxitec Wikipedia for more information. 
Even though the main method to control or prevent the transmission of dengue virus is to combat vector mosquitoes, a fresh, adaptive and innovative approach is urgent to battle this buzzing menace. An active approach of monitoring and surveillance of vectors, as mentioned above should be carried out to determine effectiveness of control interventions, an approach we are yet to witness in reality, by local authorities tasked with tackling the disease. 


Prevention of Dengue
Thinking out of the box
Is the strategy employed to fight Dengue, the fiercest enemy that the country is currently battling, successful Even though the authorities are in denial, the fact that theres no significant reduction in Dengue despite all preventative measures being taken each day, the disease is spreading throughout the country like wildfire and cant be ignored. Speaking to Dr. Lal Jayasinghe, the Dailymirror explored the possibilities of whether alternate strategies can be used in the prevention of Dengue. It must be noted that the objective here is not to belittle the massive effort taken by hundreds of officials to fight this battle, but to open up our readers minds to the alternate possibilities that might exist, which, combined with the current strategies, will improve the efficiency of the remedies.

The following are excerpts of the interview done with Dr. Jayasinghe, who served as a MOH in Sri Lanka on two occasions, once in 1960s and again in 1990s. He also worked in the Public Health Department of the Ministry of Health in 1990s. In between he worked in UK where his was associated with public health. His possesses the qualifications MBBS, DPH, MRCP. 
QWhat is the present strategy adopted by the government and why is dengue still skyrocketing despite all efforts
The governments view is that dengue can be controlled only by eradicating mosquito breeding sites from environments close to homes. This strategy may have appeared sensible 25 years ago when we had few cases. In spite of the ever increasing number of dengue cases, the government hasnt changed its strategy at all. I have highlighted in my report to President Maithripala Sirisena, that although the number of mosquito breeding sites has dropped, dengue cases keep increasing. Does this not indicate that the strategy isnt working viously the strategy isnt working and thats why the number of cases is rising daily. 
QWhy should we focus on transmission of the virus itself
Unfortunately in Sri Lanka, the impression has been created that the cause of dengue is the mosquito. This impression is further strengthened by the fact that when dengue is always mentioned in any media theres a picture of a mosquito. Dengue is spread by the mosquito acquiring the virus from a dengue patient, incubating for 8-10 days and infecting a healthy person by its sting. So the way to stop the epidemic is by breaking this chain. In other words, stopping the virus either getting into a mosquito and/or stopping the mosquito transferring the virus to a new person. Its the virus that causes the illness and not the mosquito. 
QIs this method feasible  How
Even though, on a yearly basis, there are thousands of dengue patients, if you take an average day in the year there are only a limited number of cases in the country. To give an example, until the end of June this year, i.e 182 days, there were 77000 dengue patients reported. Lets assume that the cases were reported on an equal and regular basis (this is of course not the way they are reported. But we will assume so to illustrate the point). Then every day 77000/182 new patients will develop dengue. As the disease lasts on average 1 week, on any day in the country there were 77000/182 x 7 = 2962 patients either at home or in hospital. All of the dengue viruses in Sri Lanka were inside these 2962 patients (and of course the infected mosquitoes). In other words the virus is trapped. If we stop these patients being bitten by mosquitoes the virus will die. We may not be able to prevent all of these patients being bitten by mosquitoes. That doesnt matter because if we prevent a good number of patients being bitten and continue to do so for a period of weeks, the number of patients associated with the virus will gradually reduce and the disease will eventually disappear.
QHow should we overcome the practical problems that we face in implementing this programme
We need to protect the dengue patients in hospitals. The best arrangement is to house them in designated wards. Even though there is some cost involved, the best option is to either air condition the wards or if that isnt practical, because of the building, to surround the ward using mosquito netting. This may sound expensive. What is the worth of human life How many have died this year Was it their fault If you read the newspapers you will observe that millions are being spent on unnecessary projects. The patients at home should be protected by both mosquito nets and insect repellents as nets alone arent sufficient due to patients moving around the house. 
QDoes adopting this method mean we should reduce or give up altogether the measures to control mosquito breeding
Certainly not. Mosquitoes are a nuisance even if they dont cause dengue. In addition the less mosquitoes present, the less chance for them to reach a dengue patient and spread the disease. The mistake is to limit the strategy to control breeding only. There are other things that can be done to prevent mosquito bites. The houses can be screened with netting or the curtains can be impregnated with insect repellent. The interior of houses can be checked to ensure no mosquitoes are resting within. People can wear clothes to cover their arms and legs. Recently a very good suggestion was made that younger boys too should wear long trousers to school. The suggestion was made, according to the press report because the educational authorities had noticed that children who were catching dengue were those wearing shorts. 
QWhat is the role of the public in implementing this strategy 
As with any other strategy, the public have a very important role to play regarding this strategy as well. Not all dengue patients are hospitalized. In fact if the public managed to protect all or at least the majority of dengue patients at home, that alone will help eradicate dengue in the future. The importance of protecting patients in hospitals is to set an example and highlight the importance associated with protecting dengue patients from mosquitoes. The day when the public get to know the real story behind dengue, they on their own initiative will protect all fever patients, irrespective of eventual diagnosis, and the epidemic will end. The sooner that day arrives, sooner the epidemic will end. The media has a role to play in educating the public on the true nature of dengue transmission. 
We have an advantage over other countries because we are an island. All the dengue viruses living in Sri Lanka are made in Sri Lanka! They havent arrived here from other countries. If we stop growing them in our bodies the virus will eventually die. Singapore doesnt have this advantage because everyday, thousands of workers, students and vehicles arrive in Singapore from Malaysia and other countries. Some of them no doubt bring the virus, if not the mosquitoes. 
QAre there any lessons that we can learn from how Sri Lanka eradicated Malaria, that will help with the prevention of dengue
The lesson we can learn from Malaria and Filariasis eradication from Sri Lanka is that in both cases we eliminated the causative organism, not the vector i.e the mosquito. In fact for a long time we tried to control both disease by controlling the vector, but without success. By finding malaria cases and treating them we killed the causative organism within the patient, hence it couldnt infect another person. By repeatedly doing this over a period with regard to each patient, we finally got rid of the malaria parasite from the whole of Sri Lanka. In the case of filariasis we didnt treat the patients only, but the whole population and in the process caught all the parasites in one go. Unfortunately we have no effective treatment for dengue, so we cannot use the method we used for malaria and filariasis.
However there is one weakness associated with the dengue virus and we can use to eliminate it. The virus can live in a person for 7 days only. It has to find another person within the 7 days or die. If we protect all patients with the virus from mosquitoes we will succeed as we did with malaria and filariasis. In fact we know the people who are harbouring the virus, namely the dengue patients. As I said before there are only a few thousand of them at any given time.
In the case of filariasis we didnt treat the patients only, but the whole population and in the process caught all the parasites in one go
I know there are people who will say that we dont know all the dengue patients, so we cannot do it. But there is something we know about dengue patients. They have fever. Some will immediately say not all fever patients have dengue. Some others will say that some dengue patients wont have fever. This is my answer to the first lot. What is the harm in preventing mosquitoes from biting fever patients who do not have dengue If we were prepared to give drugs to people who we didnt know they had filariasis in order to get rid of the filarial worm, why are we reluctant to prevent mosquitoes from biting fever patients Not everybody in the country had filariasis The answer to those that highlights the existence of dengue patients without fever is that. It doesnt matter if we missed some cases because they didnt have fever. We missed some malaria patients and it didnt matter. And two, it is not clear that dengue patients without fever are a threat because they may not have enough virus in them to transmit via a mosquito bite. 
Dr. Jayasinghes strategy focusing on isolation of suspected Dengue is in fact, not a new practice to Sri Lankan culture. We have been keeping people who have highly infectious diseases like Mumps and Chickenpox in isolation since the old times. Some small scale campaigns inspired by the idea put forward by Dr. Jayasinghe are currently being carried out island wide. It is the responsibility of the personnel in charge to give due attention and take necessary steps towards implementation.

Lets arm ourselves against this menace!
Integrated Vector Management as prevention
Speaking to Daily Mirror, Community Physician attached to the Dengue Control Unit Dr. Prachila Samaraweera said that at present the Dengue Control Unit is entrusted with the responsibility of carrying out an Integrated Vector Management system to eradicate the threat of dengue mosquitoes. She said that under the Integrated Vector Management system, the unit is targeting source reduction, adult mosquitoe control and larvae control. 
Dr. Himantha Atukorale, Vavuniya General Hospital
As a measure of prevention, currently we are focusing on Source Reduction where we seek out the potential breeding grounds of dengue mosquitoes and destroy them. Also, we carry out fumigation procedures as part of controlling the risk of adult mosquitoes in the environment. Usually, fogging is carried out in areas that are most prone to be detected with adult mosquitoes. Additionally, we are constantly focusing on larvae control using chemicals she said. 
As a measure of prevention, currently we are focusing on Source Reduction where we seek out the potential breeding grounds of dengue mosquitoes and destroy them
In addition to the above, the Presidential Task Force is carrying out cleaning programmes in public and private institutes; especially in schools. It has been made mandatory to allocate an hour to clean all institutions at least once a week as a prevention step. It is also pivotal to ensure that ones home environment is maintained clean. Roof gutters, drains and canals, lavatory systems and any place prone to the accumulation of water needs to be cleaned and maintained properly. The public is therefore bound to play a proactive role in help preventing the risk of dengue mosquitoes Dr. Samaraweera added. 

Try these two steps
Speaking to Daily Mirror, Consultant Rheumatologist at the Vavuniya General Hospital, Dr. Himantha Atukorale stressed the need to employ practical methods in curbing the deadly mosquito carrying the dengue virus. He stated that Dengue virus doesnt get transmitted from generation to another generation of mosquitoes nor does it Run in the family. According to him, it requires the help of a hapless human being in order for the virus to pass on. 
Firstly, use nets to cover the dengue patient from the mosquitoes. If fresh mosquitoes dont bite on patients, there is no way for the insect to acquire the virus. The virus swims within the blood of patients during fever days and could last in the blood stream for about four days after the onset of fever. The patient should be protected from the mosquito even after the onset of fever that lasts for four days. However this is very difficult to be carried out in the hospital set up. In crowded wards where nets arent possible, smoke fumigation might help to keep away the insects Dr. Atukorale said. 
Secondly, we should somehow promote the simple Plastic bottle egg trap. The bottles are cut and assembled in such a way that when filled with water, it lures the mosquito to lay eggs. Gravity causes the eggs to fall in to a separate bottom section of the bottle. But the larvae coming out of eggs are unable to fly away. If many such traps are made available in the environment, itll render eggs useless and cut down the mosquito population in half. So lets trap the virus inside patients, and trap the eggs inside bottles during this time of calamity he added.

Chinese Nobel laureate and political prisoner dies
	

Chinas Nobel peace prize laureate Liu Xiaobo has passed away at the age of 61. 
He died in hospital today after being transferred there from a prison a month ago. 
Liu was serving an 11 year sentence for subversion. 
The legal bureau in the northeastern city of Shenyang, where he had been hospitalised, confirmed his death ina statement. 
Supporters and foreign governments had urged China to allow him to receive treatment abroad however Chinese authorities insisted that he remain in the country. 
Liu had expressed a wish to seek medical treatment in either the US or Germany to help prolong his life. Doctors from both countries visited him earlier this week and said that he could be moved but staff at the hospital would need to act fast. 
He was imprisoned for the first time in connection with the 1989 Tiananmen Square pro-democracy protests. Liu was arrested in 2008 after co-writing Charter 08, a petition that called for the protection of basic human rights and reform of Chinas one-party Communist system. 
He was jailed for 11 years. 
In 2010 he was awarded the Nobel Peace Laureate Prize while serving his fourth prison sentence. Liu was banned from attending the awards ceremony with a chair left empty in his honour. He is survived by his wife Liu Xia who has been placed under house arrest since the time of her husband being awarded the Nobel award.

He came up with this statement addressing the South Asian Association of Regional Cooperation (SAARC) interior ministers meeting in Colombo last morning.
It has taken us nearly one and a half years for the steering committee of the constitutional assembly to decide on writing a report. That one and a half year wait is worth it because we are putting it out soon, he said.
The Prime Minister said the government had begun to address the issue of missing persons but stressed that confidence building also had to in place.
We are addressing the issues of the missing persons. There has to be confidence building measures before enforcing laws and safeguarding human rights. We need time to get together. There was an unfortunate incident in the North recently and the police took action. Incidents are not limited to the North as it happens in the other parts of the country as well. Today like the other parts of the country action is being taken in the North as well. We have a top UN official in Colombo and we are more than happy to meet him and explain the situation to him, he said. (By Yohan Perera)

Dengue statistics: Authorities face difficulties in notifying accurate numbers
	
The Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) today said that an issue has arisen when obtaining the accurate number of Dengue patients, since the responsible authorities were not able to notify it on a daily basis.
GMOA Additional Secretary Dr. Naveen De Soyza said that the authorities were unable to notify the number of Dengue patients admitted in their hospitals due to the busy routine as a result of the Dengue outbreak.
When a doctor diagnoses a patient with dengue, it is necessary to update this in the hospital records. The doctors and other relevant authorities would only be able to find remedies to the condition through these details, he said.
He said however, there were many contradictions with regard to the number of Dengue patients, and added that about 100,000 Dengue patients were reported around the country.
He said the condition was specially prevalent in private hospitals.
Dr. De Soyza said they had earlier referred a letter containing several proposals for Dengue eradication to President Maithripala Sirisena.
As a trade union, the GMOA has appointed an Action Committee to control this epidemic, which has made several proposals on a scientific basis to the issue. According to these proposals, the prevailing conditions should be analysed in district and divisional levels, he said. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)

Sri Lankas most progressive private commercial bank, Hatton National Bank PLC (HNB), conducted a special ceremony to mark the opening of its centralized processing centre, titled Centre of Excellence, to accommodate its back office operations for its extensive network of customer service centres.
The Centre of Excellence, situated at No.10, Sri Uttarananda Mawatha, Colombo 3, was established by bringing together HNBs Centralized Operations Department (COD) and Centralized Credit Operations (CCO) units and houses over 350 staff.
The opening ceremony was graced by HNB Chief Operating Officer Dilshan Rodrigo as the chief guest and HNB Board Director Dr. Rohan Karunaratne, HNB Chief Risk Officer/Assistant General Manager Risk Damith Pallewatte, HNB Assistant General Manager Operations Asanga Uduwela as guests of honour and other corporate management members.  
In his address Rodrigo commented that this is historic step in the digital transformation journey, where branch banking would focus on customer acquisition, relationship building and retention, the Centre of Excellence would focus on streamlined processes, systems, skilled staff, delivering quality with speed to effectively support the front line.
The ultimate test of success would be to drive customer experience and satisfaction to a different level. There are significant efforts being made to incorporate best practices not just by improving the existing processes but moving in to redesign and innovations of our processes to match the digital lifestyles of customers today.
The opening of HNBs Centre of Excellence demonstrates our commitment to drive best-in-class customer experience in delivering the range of retail lending products to our customers. In this quest we have studied the entire process from end-to-end and remain committed to deliver the best solution that meets the needs of our increasingly digital customers, Pallewatte elaborated.
When it comes to back office operations, we always have to remind ourselves continuously that we need to serve both our internal and external customers. We have to ensure best conditions are provided to branches to enable them to provide customer satisfaction at highest levels to all our customers. Branches have been requesting for a long time to centralize back office operations, in order to provide quality and consistent service for customers.
Our team here is geared to provide best level of service when it comes to providing back office services and also thanked the service providers for the great support provided to carry out outsourced operations, Uduwela commented.
The digitalization and centralization of its back end processes are anticipated to drastically streamline HNBs backend processes, enabling faster turnaround, improved and consistent quality in interactions with customers. Operating across 252 customer service centres islandwide, HNB has one of the most extensive retail footprints in the Sri Lankan banking industry. Given that all major back-end processes  spanning both credit and operational processes  will now be centralized at the Centre of Excellence, HNB aims to completely free up its branch teams to focus on delivering highly personalized and specialized banking solutions to its clients, all while building lasting relationships founded on trust and mutual respect.

I will reveal truth about 2011 WC final: Arjuna
	
World Cup winning captain Arjuna Ranatunga yesterday demanded an immediate inquiry into the 2011 ICC Cricket World Cup final between Sri Lanka and India played in Mumbai, India.
He said this in response to comments made by former Sri Lanka Captain Kumar Sangakkara who earlier questioned as to whose responsibility the 2009 Tour of Pakistan was arranged.
Sangakkara asked that an investigation be made into why the team was sent to Pakistan when there were no proper answers to security concerns.

WATCH THE VIDEO -Courtesy : Ada
If Mr. Sangakkara wants an inquiry into the tour of Pakistan then they should have one. But I think we should also inquire what happened to the Sri Lanka Team during the 2011 World Cup final. I think this is something that the Sports Minister should look into rather than concentrating on fitness issues, Ranatunga, the Minister of Petroleum and Renewable Resources said.
I was on the panel of commentators during this World Cup final, and I was really disappointed with Sri Lankas performance.
I cannot reveal what happened on that day, but I would someday reveal the truth. So, I think we should hold an inquiry into this matter, Ranatunga said.
S. Liyanagama was the Competent Authority at that time and I was the President of the Asian Cricket Council (ACC) a few months before. We played the Asia Cup in Pakistan without any incident and the tournament was a success. After that Charlie Austins team informed me that they want to go for the IPL (Indian Premier League). I refused to endorse the request as I could not betray my country. After that, the former Sports Minister Gamini Lokuge removed me from the Cricket Board, Ranatunga said.
Sri Lanka lost the 2011 World Cup final under the captaincy of Kumar Sangakkara.
He made this statement at a press conference held at the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation office in Colombo. (Ada)

Kalutara youth attack: Case deferred to August. 25
	
A youth, who had been allegedly assaulted by two policemen, today denied police claims at Mathugama Court that he asked the police not to pursue the case in a police inquiry.
Tharindu Priyankara (16) was beaten by two police officers at Dodangoda, Kalutara on 1st. April for not obeying a police order to stop.
Two police officers attached to the Dodangoda Police Station were suspended after a video clip emerged, showing them beating a motorcyclist mercilessly.
He was beaten up in broad-daylight watched by a crowd of by-standers, one of whom videoed and uploaded the incident on social media that went viral later.
Kalutara ASP Kapila Premadasa had probed the incident and had suspended the two men -Sergeant Chandrajith Kapilasiri (59558) and Constable N. Arunasiri (6108) attached to the Dodangoda Police Station. Later the police withdrew the case stating the victim requested them not to continue the investigation.
However, the Ceylon Motorcyclists' Association and the boys parents filed a case against the police in Court.
Attorney-at-Law Nallapperuma appearing for the victim informed that the victim denied he requested not to continue the investigation.
The Matugama Additional Magistrate postponed the case to August 25 as the police failed to produce the victims medical certificate. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

Key eyewitness, lawyer threatened with death
	
Are the authorities refusing to see
A gruesome scene after the prison riot
The witness plays a vital role in concluding the verdict of any case. Hence, its very important to ensure the safety of witnesses. The continuing practice of victim and witness intimidation is a prevalent problem in Sri Lanka, despite it not openly discussed much. With the purpose of preventing those from testifying against offenders, illegal interference and intimidation are levelled by offenders as they try to remain free and to continue committing crimes. 
Welikada riots, which took place on November 09, 2012, claiming 27 lives of inmates, was subject to severe reprehension in the society. The shoot-out incident that happened within the prison was witnessed by many jailers and inmates apart from the armed forces who stormed the prison. 
Lawyer Senaka Perera
A key eyewitness Sudesh Nandimal Silva, who was in remand when the riots took place, had been fighting for justice of the dead prisoners. Being the only living witness who is involved in the campaign against the Welikada incident, Nandimal has been continuously threatened by various groups since he was released from prison. He had lodged complaints with relevant law enforcement authorities, but to no avail.
Being the only living witness who is involved in the campaign against the Welikada incident, Nandimal has been continuously threatened since he was released from prison
For the fourth time, on Tuesday (11), Nandimal and attorney-at-law Senaka Perera, the counsel who appears for him in a writ petition filed at the Court of Appeal, were allegedly to have been threatened with death. Both had received a telephone call at around 7.45p.m., urging them not to pull up the Welikada case. This threatening incident comes 6 days after both gave an interview to the Daily Mirror in a follow-up article regarding the Welikada riots. The article was titled, Welikada riots witnesses ready to back those denied justice. 
Sudesh Nandimal
Nandimal said he was warned that he would have to face many problems if he continued his fight for justice. He said this wasnt the first time he has been threatened. This is the fourth time I have been threatened, including with death, Nadimal told the Daily Mirror. 
Weeks after I gave testimony before the CID in 2012, two men in a vehicle followed my motorcycle for several days. They have visited my workplace and inquired about my whereabouts from the security guards. The vehicle number, noted down by the guards, was later found to be of a vehicle belonging to the Police Narcotics Bureau. This was established in an investigation launched by the Maligawatta Police on my complaint, However the inquiry didnt proceed thereafter.
This threatening incident comes 6 days after both gave an interview to the Daily Mirror in a follow-up article regarding the Welikada riots. The article was titled, Welikada riots witnesses ready to back those denied justice
On October 2, 2015, two unidentified men have threatened him in Moratuwa, urging him not to take up the Welikada case as some of them will have to end up behind bars. Sudesh Nandimal had lodged a complaint with the Moratuwa Police. No investigation was initiated, he said. 
He said that lately, presenters of some radio programme had branded him as a traitor and slung mud at him. In spite of a complaint lodged at the Police Division for the Protection of Victims and Witnesses, no inquiry has been initiated thus far. 
Meanwhile, lawyer Senaka Perera told the Daily Mirrror that he was also asked to get himself out from the writ petition in which he appears for Nandimal to seek an order, directing the Inspector General of Police (IGP) and the CID, Director to commence a fresh investigation into the incident. 
On March 19, 2016, Nandimal had written to the Inspector General of Police, referring to the above threats and requested for protection and action against those responsible. Yet, he hasnt received any response. 
However both of them said they arent willing to give up their fight despite threats. Senaka and Nandimal charge the law enforcement authorities are failing to stop the threats that continue. 
Law Enforcement Agencies must act forthwith
- Human Right Lawyer J.C.Weliamuna PC
Law enforcement authorities must take actions immediately. Under the Witness Protection law, this is a non-bailable offence. Although this kind of incidents had happened earlier with regard to other cases, this is more serious because both the lawyer and the only living eye witness who has been testifying against the culprits were intimidated.
The CID is doing a pretty wonderful job in cases of the murder of ruggerite Wasim Thajudeen and journalist Lasantha Wickramatunge
In addition to that, the Bar Association also should intervene into the matter because the lawyer had to face this experience while he was performing his duties. 
He also spoke about the delay in investigating the Welikada incident. 
Under the Witness Protection law, this is a non-bailable offence
Nothing happened before the change of the government. There are a large number of uninvestigated cases relating to the incidents that happened during the previous government. We see less political interference under this government. I believe that this case, in 2012, where 27 deaths of inmates were reported in Welikada, should be handed over the CID. The CID is doing a pretty wonderful job in cases of the murder of ruggerite Wasim Thajudeen and journalist Lasantha Wickramatunge. It will take some time for the CID to finish the investigations because they happened many years ago, the lawyer remarked.

We will urge the police to expedite inquiry
- Bar Association Secretary Attorney Amal Randeniya
There are several committees in the BASL to probe such incidents. I will personally discuss with the President of the BASL Attorney U.R.De Silva regarding the threatening incident of the mentioned lawyer Senaka Perera. As far I am concerned, Senaka Perera is a respected lawyer who does his job right. 
We will go through the complaint first. We will directly inform the relevant parties.
As Senaka Perera had already lodged a complaint with Nittambuwa Police, as the Bar Association, we will urge the police to expedite the investigation and bring the culprits to book. 
We will also need an affidavit from Senaka. There have been such instances where lawyers complain with the BASL against such alleged threats while they practise their profession. After sometime, they dont stay with what they stated in the complaint. 
We will go through the complaint first. We will directly inform the relevant parties
Some parties, especially in criminal cases, like judges and lawyers get threatened. It has been there for a long time. That is why the BASL is there to safeguard the lawyers and judges, ensuring their safety and freedom so that they can perform their duties as professionals. 

Awaiting AGs instructions
- Officer in charge of the Victims of Crime and Witnesses Assistance and Protection Division, SSP G.J.A.Wijesekara
My division was formed in November, 2016. According to the procedure of the division, once we receive a complaint of threatening and intimidating a witness or a victim, facts of the case are referred to the authorities and seek instructions on further actions.

When it comes to this particular case regarding the Welikada riots, eyewitness Nandimal Silva, the division is currently awaiting instructions of the Attorney General Department as to what should be done hereafter. 

How a witness can seek protection
QWhat are the existing government institutions to protect victims and witnesses 
The Assistance to and Protection of Victims of Crime and Witnesses Act, No.04 was established in 2015 to protect the victims of crime and witnesses. Based on the Act, the establishment of National Authority for the Protection of Victims of Crime and Witnesses was set up. According to the Gazette Extra Ordinary No.1966/02 dated 09/05/2016, the subject that lies with the scope of the Authority was entrusted with the Ministry of Justice. 
The Authority is responsible for investigating and monitoring the infringement of rights and entitlements of the victims of crime and witnesses, making recommendations to state institutions, public officers and courts of law and guarantee protection of the victims of crime and witnesses. 
Under the direction and guidance of National Authority, a Division called The Victims of Crime and Witnesses Assistance and Protection Division was set up in Sri Lanka Police in November, 2016. 
In Sri Lanka, currently there are several ways witnesses can seek protection from the government.
1. The National Authority for the Protection of victims of Crime and Witnesses. 
2. The Victims of Crime and Witnesses Assistance and Protection Division. 
3. Courts of law. 
4. The Commissions (The Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka, The Commission to Investigate Bribery or Corruptions, Investigations Commissions or a Special Presidents Commission of Inquiry or any other Commission appointed under the Commission of Inquiry Act. 
5. Officer-in-Charge of the Police in the area.

Let us get (ourselves) close to our country
	
Modernity isnt opposed to nationalism. This we should know. The confusion or rather dichotomy between the two has arisen because many of us are clueless about what they represent. This too we should know. Fact is, there cant be modernity without anchoring oneself in the past. Fact is, there cant be nationalism (and there are many nationalisms) without preparing oneself for the future. The two are coterminous; the one cant thrive and flourish without the other. This isnt a political statement, rather a truism that cuts across the political and the social. 
There was a time, not too long ago, and in my generation, when those who purported to speak on behalf of Sinhala Buddhists were silenced. To speak of that collective was tantamount to being a racist, which was rather duplicitous given the carte blanche which the articulators and propagandists of Eelamism were given. There seemed to be a manifest lack of understanding about historical realities, or about the difference between speaking on behalf of one collective and speaking on behalf of that collective AGAINST another. The latter was incendiary, hardly condonable. The former, however, wasnt. Those who tried to prevent it, needless to say, ended up constricting any space for the representatives of Sinhala Buddhists. 
At one level, this confusion is more than mischievous, anti-historical, and ontological. What is nationalism and where does it end How is it different to racism, and how is racism (which is negative and depends on the repudiation of the legitimacy of the Other) different to racialism (which falls somewhere in-between) What is positive, if at all, and what isnt A single writer cant set the record straight. It takes a general sammuthiya (A collective effort) to agree on which is what and what is not, in this respect. 
Its not easy being a nationalist. Its easier being a racist. The reason is obvious. Racism drives on self-labelled superiority and on what is perceived as inferiority on the part of the Other. It doesnt take much to spout hatred; burn a few shops belonging to one community, vandalise a temple, kovil, church, or mosque, and youll be soon hailed by extremists as their hero. That is why chauvinists from both sides have won and prevailed for so long, and why someone like Gnanasara Thera is (regardless of his credentials as a monk) deified despite the fact that no one voted for his party. He has something important to say, is the commonest excuse given by his supporters. 
Its tougher being a nationalist. This is elementary. It takes rhetoric to hate. It takes heartfelt sincerity to love. Racism thrives on rhetoric. Nationalism, at least to a certain extent, thrives on sincerity. Emotion bests reason in more ways than one, which is why the former tends to best the latter as far as debate is concerned. That is sad. 
Take the subject of independence. How many of us, never mind the flag and the usual chest-thumping words about freedom, appreciate what it stands for Perhaps decades of cynicism has conditioned us to be cynical with everything. Perhaps those decades have taught that we havent really clinched independence. Either way, the mere fact that we arent subject to another foreign power is in the least worthy of contemplation. But we toss it aside with the remark, It is just a word. 
We dont produce nationalists like we used to, come to think of it. Taken in itself, theres nothing to bemoan in this; the fact is that the deficiencies of one epoch are compensated by the promises of the next, which means that sooner or later, the voice of the people, of true, genuine patriotism, will prevail. But this is just scratching the surface. The real problem, which goes deeper, is that far from being unable to produce nationalists, our country will be taken over by an entire generation whose love for their country is at best conditioned if not tempered by a rootless variant of cosmopolitanism; the kind of uprooted cosmopolitanism that runs riot in Colombo. Which in itself is bad enough, since much of our self-labelled intelligentsia hail from this part of the country, and they continue to exert influence everywhere. 
Long, long ago, this wasnt a problem. Our schools and curricula were built in love for ones country and its people from an early age. We woke up every day to deshabimana gee or patriotic songs on radio, none of which encouraged us to hate other collectives. By deshabimana gee I am of course thinking of artistes like Amaradeva, Mahagama Sekara, and Chandrarathna Manawasinghe, among others. They werent racists. They couldnt have been. The fact is that they were rooted in their societies, so what they wrote, composed, and sang, they felt. And they made us feel what they wrote. 
We read the poems of Tibetan born S. Mahinda Thera and P. B. Alwis Perera without feeling any antipathy towards other races or faiths. We sang them in gushes and torrents, with gusto, because we intensely felt what they were trying to say. Me Rata Mage Rata Ma Ipadunu Rata, Miranda Hemalatha wrote, and as we recited those words from memory, the poetry hit us. That kind of literature, at once rhythmic and rousing, is hard to come by today. No wonder most of our children continue their schooling without the slightest smattering of love for their land of birth. No wonder they end up being biased against history, even culturally insensitive. 
Its not easy being a nationalist. Its easier being a racist. The reason is obvious. Racism drives on self-labelled superiority and on what is perceived as inferiority on the part of the Other
The culture of prudery that has seeped into our people, who knows from where, has aggravated this issue. We dont teach our children to understand their faith; we force them to attend Sunday school. We dont teach them our history; we force them to read and unconditionally accept it. Our government textbooks arent helpful in this respect either. Just the other day, for instance, I came across a chapter detailing the biographies of some of our foremost artistes, which had erroneously interchanged the details of Lester James Peries and Ediriweera Sarachchandra. I know for a fact that we are force-fed to accept these texts. How do we progress with that 
The truth is that love for ones country (of the genuine sort) is predicated on what one picks up from childhood. If that childhood is warped, if it isnt surrounded by an environment which makes it amenable for someone to understand where one is and how he or she came to be there, the outcome is obvious; the presence of an entire generation of distorted, culturally uprooted citizens. Without the strength or the resolve to stand up for ones land of birth, without the ability to assess history, no one can progress. Martin Wickramasinghe wrote on this. When history dies, so does the conscience of a nation. 
We dont produce nationalists like we used to, come to think of it. Taken in itself, theres nothing to bemoan in this; the fact is that the deficiencies of one epoch are compensated by the promises of the next
So what are the preconditions for a healthier citizenry First and foremost, the ability to take in and absorb the best the world offers. This is elementary, again, but then we have confused between absorbing and imitating. We are constantly told to move on, to do away with patriotism, to consider ourselves as citizens of the world. The problem with globalisation of that sort, however, is that those who force us to accept ourselves as citizens of the world ( la Diogenes) are themselves representatives of countries and polities which vehemently (and rightly) rebel against that line of thinking. Like the United States. 
Secondly, we need to reevaluate the way we teach our children our history. History isnt about dates. That is obvious. Its about aligning the one with the other, about inferring parallels and understanding how communities progress and flourish. Speaking from experience, my best history teacher (in Eighth Grade) taught us more than what happened when and what led to what else. She taught us how to connect the dots, to infer the causes behind an incident or event. As I grew up, and as I read into history, I realised how, even in a mild form, she was emulating the incomparable Fernand Braudel, that historian who taught us that his subject was best taught not through memorising bundles of data, but by making the connections necessary to glean cause from effect, and effect from cause. 
Were barking up the wrong tree, I believe. Until and unless we nurture our children, and make them more sensitive to their surroundings, without discouraging them from learning about them owing to that culture of prudery which runs riot in this country, well be fermenting a generation thats cut off from their environment. That is bad. Not because nationalism is cast in stone and is a must, but because no country in this godforsaken, globalised world of ours has progressed without anchoring itself in its past, its way of life. Without history, without heritage, put simply, we are nothing.
