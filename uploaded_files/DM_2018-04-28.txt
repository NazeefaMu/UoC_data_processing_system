A WAY TO LIVE  AND A WAY TO DIE
	

What is Buddhism Is it a religion or a philosophy

A true Buddhist would accept the basic Buddhist analysis of life as one that accommodates the teachings of the Buddha.
It involves no dogmatism, no form of worship. One could say it is a code of morality, a way of life as it were.
The Buddha with his infinite wisdom discovered the fundamental disease affecting all men and women, the unsatisfactory nature of all phenomenal existence.

All the desires by which we are cursed leads to misery; if not gratified, alike to misery: if gratified, to misery of extreme satiety

It was he who raised the veil and showed us the world as it is, the unending suffering and pain all men, women and all living beings are heir to.
In Buddhism, there is no creator-God who rewards or punishes.
Look not for refuge to anyone but oneself. I am only your teacher, the Buddha said. These words give us the satisfaction of knowing that in our own hands lies the power to mould our future lives.
We and we alone are the creators of our destiny. Did not Shakespeare himself say, Our remedies oft in ourselves do lie, which we ascribe to heaven

It was the Buddha who said that there was a solution, a cure to this problem. He prescribed the four Noble Truths and the Noble Eight-Fold Path that led to a place free of distress and danger - Nibbana

No prayers, no entreaties to heaven, no priests absolution, any rites and rituals can liberate us from the entanglements of human life. As we sow, we reap. That is the karmic theory.
So, it seems imperative that we find a method of escape from this unending chain of suffering called Sansara.
It was the Buddha who said that there was a solution, a cure to this problem. He prescribed the four Noble Truths and the Noble Eight-Fold Path that led to a place free of distress and danger - Nibbana.
What is Nibbana and what is its ultimate purpose The answer to this world-old question is contained in a word for which there is noEnglish correlation.
If any teach Nirvana is to cease,
Say unto such they lie,
If any say Nibbana is to live,
Say unto such they err.
Such is Edwin Arnolds admonition.
There are the three great instruments of Dhana, sila and Bhavana. Sila or more aptly called discipline regulates our words and deeds.
It is the foot-rule that marks out a straight line to a life of virtue. Meditation is the compass that helps dispel all vanity, pride and selfishness and helps fill our minds with Metta or universal love. No easy task. It requires resolve and great dedication.

It was he who raised the veil and showed us the world as it is, the unending suffering and pain all men, women and all living beings areheir to

Ananda. They who are correct in living according to the Dhamma are the ones who will reach their goal, the Buddha said.
We see mens lives riddled with lust, greed and revenge usually it is the I and the mine, the foremost factors in our lives, that bring on these defilements of the mind. It sprang and flourished on the soil of selfish desire, passions and delusion.
The cause of all suffering according to the Buddha was the craving for worldly things. This craving is often deep, unending and insatiable. Dazzled by lifes deceptive show, its allure, we are drawn to everything that brings us joy and satisfaction. Good food, fine clothes, the fame that gives weight to ones slightest word, are they not good things Of course, they are.
Yet, one must think about its impermanence, its illusionary nature. Blinded by these false delights we cling to them, not realizing their emptiness, their hollowness.
Herbert Spencer, a renowned philosopher, impressed by the transiency of the world wisely said,
The one thing permanent is the reality hidden under ever-changing things.
Thomas Macaulay, another English writer voiced his sentiment thus: All the desires by which we are cursed leads to misery; if not gratified, alike to misery: if gratified, to misery of extreme satiety.
The lesson to be learnt is not to ossify the hearts ill it cannot feel, but to transfer desire to a higher plane of being, a loftier one.
The key word that should dominate our minds is detachment. Do not cling to worldly things.
Let Go the Buddha said over-and-over again.
So weed out the noxious weeds of greed and avarice. Do not let it blur your vision and block your path to deliverance. The Buddha extolled us to practise virtues like generosity, compassion and kindness to all living things. We must shun evil thoughts like anger, hatred and revenge.
These defilements only corrode the mind and heart and bring onunending misery.
Wounding and killing others is a heinous crime.
Kill not for pitys sake the
meanest thing,
Give freely and receive and take from none
by greed or force, or fraud what is not yours.
Always there will be a retribution justice. Punishment for evil acts will be pitiless and will go beyond the penalties of courts and jails.
Giving should not be tainted by any idea of favour or return. It must flow from a heart full of sympathy and love for all living things.
Then comes death, the end of life. All sentient beings are doomed to die. This is true not just for one man, one family, one city, but for the whole world. Some live in abject fear of death but face it we must. It is only an incident in life, a mere incident of being.
Parting from loved ones is inevitable. One must restrain ones tears knowing how fragile, how uncertain life is. Wailing, lamentations bring no comfort. Let those who grieve meditate on the teachings of the Buddha, seek solace from his doctrine.
I teach my disciples but one thing - sorrow and the deliverance from sorrow. So, said the Buddha.
It is after a mighty struggle each one of us has acquired the human form. Endeavour to tread the spiritual path and so break the bonds that tie us to this world, a world filled with pain and misery and anguish. Strive to save oneself from all of it and so reach that blissful state called Nibbana.
Walk ye -as Princes who follow the way of right living, extolledthe Buddha.
Be like unto brethren; one in love, one in holiness and one in zeal for doing good.
This is the only way to live and also the only way to die.

REUTERS, 27th APRIL, 2018
Bulgaria will become the euro zones 20th member, but it should not rush through the process, European Commissioner for Economic and Financial Affairs Pierre Moscovici said on Friday. The Balkan country, which currently holds the EU presidency is pushing to adopt the single currency and its Prime Minister said he sees the country into the two year obligatory precursor to the euro zone, the ERM-2, within a year. [nL8N1S34U9]
Arriving for an informal meeting of EU finance ministers in Sofia, Moscovici said the Balkan country should stay cold blooded and work on the accession criteria. Bulgaria will be the next member of the euro zone, no doubt about that, he told reporters. But we need to prepare that with method and care and we do not need to rush, because if we rush we create accession to the euro that is not perfect, he said.

Comprehending Dhamma is Nibbana
	

The most salient feature of the Buddhas teaching is awareness- awareness of the moment, the here and now; the ability to be alive and present.

You yourself will have to achieve it.
It is not Zero-state or nothingness


On Vesak Day, Buddhists of the world commemorate three events of significance to Buddhists of all traditions and sects.
The Birth, Enlightenment and the Parinbbana of Gautama Buddha. The United Nations, in 1999, resolved to internationally observe the day atits headquarters.
The Pali term Vesakha or Sanskrit Vaisakha is the name of the lunar month in the Hindu calendar.
In the Mahayana Buddhist traditions, the holiday is known by its Sanskrit name Vaisakha, While in Theravadhait is Vesak, which usually falls in the month of May; this year the authorities have decided on April 29 instead of May 29, which is designated as Adhi Poson-it is a rare exception, though many Buddhist nations, this year, celebrate the Vesak Festivalin May.

Tuchcha Pothila
Senior monk Pothila was a learned Bikkhu, who lived during Buddhas time. He was highly proficient in all facets of the Tripitaka. He became a Guru a to a large number of monks, but he never practised Dhamma and did not care for Buddhas advice to do so.
Finally, the Buddha commenced calling him, Tuchcha Pothila [Empty Pothila]; the trick worked. Theoretical or academic knowledge of Tripitaka, it must be emphasized, however deep or profound is no alternative to practice.
Asked about the nature of Nibbana, the Buddha initially maintained silence, knowing that the answer would lead to more puzzlement. Being asked where the worlds end is;
Buddha said,
It is in this one fathomed body with awareness, that I pronounce the existence of the world, its termination, the path leading to termination.
Thus Nibbana does not exist separately from ourselves. The root of Buddhas teaching is the need to understand the reality not merely at the scholarly level, but by the direct occurrence.
This, O monks truly is the peace, end of all formations, the forsaking of rebirth, fading away of craving detachment, extinction; Nibbana ---Buddha
Nibbana in thisvery life
Nibbana can be achieved in this very life; it is an optimistic state, which has to be comprehended by the mind. It is not a mere ending of craving or emptiness effect from blowing out.
It is not Zero-state or nothingness. The real meaning or sense of Nibbana cannot be understood until and unless we have achieved it.
It is not a thing that words can express in their conventional speech or by using descriptions. It is not a place or a state of affairs comparable to a plane of existence such as a heaven.
It is not a mere extinction of ignorance and craving. It is only the pathleading to it.
Origins of Nibbana lie outside existence and non-existence, as together are conditional and relative to
each other.
Nibbana can only be grasped by those who have attained it, passing beyond boundaries. Just as the fire is not hoarded up in a place but rises when basic conditions are present. To consider different propositions was as pointless as to speculate about the path in which a fire had gone once it was doused. Just as a blind does not realise what light is, the mind clouded by greed, anger and illusion will not be able to distinguish the reality of Nibbana. It cannot be weighed against anything, which comes within the reach ofour mind.
A contender must wisely examine, scrutinize and analyze objects with bare attention, applying Sathi mindfully, devoid of application ofconceptual behaviour.
Understand your nature devoid of any distortions, without any prejudice, without any response to what you determine you are, that is the beginning of austerity.
The examination, the awareness, of every deliberation, every feeling not to hold it back it, not to control it, but to observe it, like watching a bird in flight, without any of your own prejudices and misrepresentations.
Sermonizing and educating on Nibbana has a parable in Amphibian Turtles unsuccessful attempt to enlighten the experiences on the ground to a fish!

Parable of turtle and fish
After a trip around the land, the turtle returned to the water, to be questioned by the fish, why he was missing for a while. The turtle rejoined that it had been on dry territory. The fish who was clueless about dry land, cried out;
What do you mean by dry land There is nothing termed dry land. The turtle replied, How can I make you realize, but I just arrived from there.
The fish was confused; demanded to make out what exactly dry land meant, Can I swim there Is it cool and damp Does it flow Does it rise up and down in waves to each query, the turtle replied in the negative.
A thrilled fish declared, There is no such place as dry land. The turtle said, There is dry land, but, you never experienced it. You know only water so you discard it because the uniqueness of water is not there, or it is notlike water.
We are the result of what we have thought. It is established in our thoughts. It is made up of our thoughts. If one talks or acts with a wholesome thought, happiness pursues one, like a shadow that never abandons.

In the Mahayana Buddhist traditions, the holiday is known by its Sanskrit name Vaisakha, While in Theravadhait is Vesak, which usually falls in the month of May; this year the authorities have decided on April 29 instead of May 29, which is designated as Adhi Poson-it is a rare exception, though many Buddhist nations, this year, celebrate the Vesak Festival in May.

Happiness can be achieved by using knowledge and practice to attainmental equanimity.
Equanimity, or peace of mind, is achieved by shedding oneself from the series of cravings that creates dukkha.
Therefore, by achieving an intellectual state where you can detach from all the obsessions, needs and wants of life, you free yourself and attain a state of inspirational happiness and well-being.

Mindfulness and Bare Attention
Mindfulness is one of the most significant teachings of Buddha. It has filtered into an accepted culture as well as modern psychoanalysis.
The Buddha felt that it was crucial to cultivate right mindfulness for all facets of life in order to observe things as they actually are. He encouraged keen thought and awareness of all things through the four basics of mindfulness: Contemplation of the body, of feeling, of states of mind and of phenomena.
In a word, mindfulness is about understanding the moment with an approach of openness and originality to all andevery experience.
Through correct mindfulness, one can free oneself from obsessions If you are paying attention now with all your being, with your brain, with your mind, with your nerves, with your total energy; listening without comparing, not accepting, not opposing, but actually with complete awareness: then there is no entity who is observing, who is listening
If you are paying attention to the howling of dogs at night, listen with your heart, listen with your mind, with your whole body dont say I hate it or I like the sound, just listen conscientiously, then there is no observer. See an image without the interference of thought.
No observer! It is the observer who produces fear, the observer is the hub of thought, it is the I, it is the Me, the Self, the Ego; the observer is the sensor.
When there is no thought, there is no observer. It is open for us, and when we have developed into as gentle, as wise, as pure, as compassionate, and as absolutely self-controlled as an Arhant, then shall we recognize, then shall wecomprehend Nibbana.
Comprehending Dhamma is Nibbana. You yourself will have to achieve it.
May all Beings be Happy!

Yesterday when the case was taken up for inquiry prosecution Counsel Thusith Mudalige objected to the release of those assets to the owner as they were purchased funds earned illegally and furthermore were now productions used in the case.
Hence, the Court, overruling the request, fixed the trial for July 18. (T. Farook Thajudeen)

EU, US police cripple Islamic State media mouthpieces
	

THE HAGUE AFP April 27, 2018-European and US police forces have struck at the heart of Islamic States propaganda machine, seizing servers and punching a hole in its ability to spread its radical jihadist message online. 
The transatlantic take-down was spread over eight countries and was co-ordinated by the EUs police agency in a major operation over a two-year period, the head of Europol, Rob Wainwright, told AFP on Friday. 
Wednesday and Thursdays operation was the latest in a campaign targeting in particular the Amaq news agency used by IS to broadcast claims of attacks and spread its message of jihad. 
With this takedown action, targeting major IS-branded media outlets like Amaq, but also al-Bayan radio, Halumu and Nasher news, ISs capability to broadcast and publicise terrorist material has been compromised, Europol said in a statement. 
The simultaneous multinational takedown was co-ordinated by Europol from its headquarters in The Hague, and led by the Belgian federal prosecutor.

Flourishing Nuwara Eliya  has its downside
	

The midday sun in Nuwara Eliya gave me a harsh welcome and the virtually sleepy town seemed to ask me why I was present there so early in the month of April. The massive crowds that are seen in this hill city- known as Little England -were absent when I got there on April 13 (the day before New Year). But one could feel that the hill country town was slowly getting ready for the festive season ahead. 
This is a town which gives visitors a warm welcome, but scrapes you when you spend. April is the month when Nuwara Eliya turns itself into one of the most expensive towns to live in. Nuwara Eliya has huge pulling power in terms of attracting tourists, both local and foreign. Two main attractions, which fill the pathways leading to them with tourists, are Gregory Lake and Victoria Park. 
Its known to all that service providers cater largely to foreign tourists because they are easier to please compared to locals. However, interestingly these foreign tourists showed a lukewarm interest to take these boat rides offered at Gregory Lake. This was possibly because the boats were going way too fast on the lake with the boatmen jerking their motor boats to provide the thrills and spills. 
This way of riding boats just doesnt suit the environment at Gregory Lake. These speeding boats also could be disturbing the many schools of fish that have made the lake their home. But the local tourists were seen busting their hard earned money to take these boat rides. 

The blog post said that the food was too spicy and lacked nutrition. This is a little strange given that much vegetables grow in front of our own eyes in every nook and corner in Nuwara Eliya

From the day explorer Samuel Barker founded Nuwara Eliya in 1846, the town has prospered as a tourist attraction. Activities like fox and deer hunting and polo have now been replaced by pasttimes like horse racing, badminton tournaments and motor racing championships. 

Competition from Ella 
These activities once again largely cater to the interests of local tourists. Now Nuwara Eliya has competition from Ella which is offering opportunities for adventure games like kayaking and canoeing. Most tourists now avoid Nuwara Eliya and head to Ella after visiting Kandy, still easily one of the most frequented towns by foreigners throughout the year. 
Victoria Park still remains as one of the main attractions in this popular tourist town. The park remains in prime condition and is termed as one of the best maintained parks in South Asia by Lonely Planet. The many varieties of roses at the park attract visitors despite the thorns! But a large number of visitors at the park fail to capture its beauty with the cameras in their mobile phones because they are engrossed in taking selfies. One cant blame mobile phone users for doing so because this is a me era; a period where the interest of the individual is placed above environment and national interest. 
I didnt get the taste of Nuwara Eliya food much because my stay was at a hired out cottage. But a few lines a foreign tourist penned in his blog post didnt say much about whats served at wayside eateries over here. The blog post said that the food was too spicy and lacked nutrition. This is a little strange given that much vegetables grow in front of our own eyes in every nook and corner in Nuwara Eliya. There is huge potential for a restaurateur who wishes to serve some veg burgers or pure vegetarian cuisine.


Surprises 
It was evident that the town was readying itself for the horse races which were scheduled for the latter part of April. This is a sporting event which attracts the elite folk in the island. The races not only entertain spectators, but also highlight the fact that there exists the Indian equals of Maharajas in Sri Lanka. These are the folks who come to the races in their Sunday best, driving their Mercedes Benzs or SUVs. A good number of them own horses and ponies that feature in these races. However an ex-jockey, who once featured in these races and now residing in Colombo, opined that the organizers of the races should ensure that there are at least 15 horses per race if horse racing is to get to the next level and provide more opportunities to local jockeys. He said that there are occasions when there are just three horses in some races which guarantees everyone to be a winner, but provides the least entertainment to those who invest on a ticket at the grandstand. 

These activities once again largely cater to the interests of local tourists. Now Nuwara Eliya has competition from Ella which is offering opportunities for adventure games like kayaking and canoeing. Most tourists now avoid Nuwara Eliya and head to Ella after visiting Kandy

Nuwara Eliya has its ways of creating news. Recently a fully equipped District hospital was declared open to the public. In January this year the temperature dropped to 4.7 degrees celsius giving all indication that there could be ground frost. Then there was the news of a Swiss girl being abused at one of the tourist attractions in the area, Single Tree Mountain. As much as Nuwara Eliya can entertain you it can also surprise you in a negative way. 
It was a little sad to leave Nuwara Eliya after breakfast the following day (New Year day). The sun was up very early and the warm environment was inviting me to walk and explore the surroundings a little more. But lack of time stood in my way. The drive was down to Kandy, a 94 km stretch on a winding down road. The several fresh vegetable stalls on the sideways on the road spoke abundantly of the nutrition available if one lived on the any one of these mountain towns. The group I was traveling with broke journey just after we got out of Nuwara Eliya. I took time off to soak up the freshness of the cool environment and concentrated on it more than on the food that was served on to my plate. 
All went well till two scraggy and dusky kids came running towards us and stretched out their skinny hands. We promised them food, but they wanted money instead. We insisted that we would give them food and not money. At that moment there arrived another car and they started running in the direction it came from. Scenes like these spoil the beauty of this wonderful hill country. Kids of this age should be at school or at home studying. Its their parents who should be irking a living.

The sun was now right above us and telling us to leave. We left the place thinking not about the next trip to the hills, but about the future of these streets kids.
There was a lot of enthusiasm to take boat rides at Gregory Lake in Nuwara Eliya

Im ready to be Opposition Leader: Dinesh
	
While claiming that the joint opposition had secured the majority in Parliament, joint opposition parliament group leader and MP, Dinesh Gunawardena said he was ready to be the official Opposition Leader in Parliament.
He told a news briefing the incumbent Opposition Leader, R. Sampanthan was not performing his role in Parliament and should resign from the post of Opposition Leader.
It is visible that Mr. Sampanthan is supporting the government rather than raising his voice against the malpractices of the government. The Opposition should perform its role of making constructive criticism on the policies of the government. Mr. Sampanthan should also speak on behalf of the concerns of the people,the MP said. Instead of discussing burning issues of the country, the TNA is supporting all decisions taken by the Government. That is why we have taken the initiative to change that trend of the Opposition.

Instead of dates, lets focus on and live the Buddhas teachings
	
Sri Lanka celebrates Vesak Poya tomorrow though some confusion has been created over this thrice-blessed day marking the birth, enlightenment and death of Gautama the Buddha. Some Buddhist prelates say Vesak should have been celebrated on May 29 as several other Buddhist majority countries like Thailand are doing. Another controversy arose when the Buddha Sasana Minister asked that Vesak pandals, dansal and other festivities be held not on Vesak day but on April 30 and the days after. He urged that people should be encouraged to go to temples on Vesak day to listen to bana sermons and also watch some special Vesak-related films that the ministry has prepared. Some Buddhists have objected to this proposal while others have welcomed it on the basis that it will stop the trend towards the commercialisation of Vesak.
Whether it be April 29 or May 29 what is vital is for Sri Lankas Buddhists to reflect deeply on some important dimensions of the Buddha Dhamma specially the issues connected to the situation in Sri Lanka today.
Scholar monks say that Gautama the Buddha when he began his world-changing mission gave up all his privileges including those in the royal palace. Prince Siddhartha totally emptied himself and tradition has it that his first robe was stitched from pieces of yellow cloth picked up from funeral pyre sites where people left behind pieces of yellow cloth. During his entire mission, which influences hundreds of millions of people all over the world more than 2500 years after him, the Buddha lived in a simple and humble way which is known in classical Sinhala as Alpechchathawaya. Unfortunately political and other leaders who loudly and proudly proclaim Buddhism are known today to be seeking personal gain or glory, perks or privileges and are mired in the vice of Bahubhandavadaya which is the desire to accumulate more and more by way of wealth, property and possessions, power
and popularity.
The government has declared that poverty alleviation is one of its main goals and one of the important structural adjustments needed to achieve this is to bridge the gap between the rich and the poor. As in most parts of the world, in Sri Lanka also it is believed that the richest one per cent of the powerful elite own more wealth than 50 per cent of the people. 
Socio-spiritual analysts believe that an important step to bridge this gap is for our leaders -- in the political, social, religious and other spheres -- to live in a simple and humble way, stop wasteful expenditure or indulging in luxuries and extravagance. Unfortunately, in Sri Lanka this hallowed concept is preached by many but few are those who practise it sincerely and quietly. When we live in a simple and humble way we will be able to save more and thereby share more with millions of people known to be caught in a poverty trap set up by a selfish and
wicked world.
Sharing more needs to go beyond just giving some money to poverty-trapped people. Their dignity as human beings needs to be restored and therefore measures must be taken to help them to earn their own living. This could be done by providing them the means for self employment or giving them productive and reasonably-paid jobs so that they will have an equal place in society and also an equal say in decision-making.
The Buddhas main theme was, may all beings be happy. That means we need to live and work in a way that makes all creatures happy. It also means that everything created -- including the air, the sea, the trees and soil should be cared for properly and we need to be good stewards. In modern terms that means effectively getting involved in the battle against global warming or climate change.
Thus instead of focusing on dates we need to reflect on and more importantly live in the way the Buddha wanted us to so that it will be a happy and blessed Vesak for all.

Merkel in battle to save the Iran nuclear deal
	

(Daily Mail), 27 April 2018 - The Iran nuclear deal is set to dominate the agenda when German Chancellor Angela Merkel visits the White House later on Friday. 
Merkel is heading to the White House for talks with Donald Trump and is facing an uphill struggle to save the nuclear deal, avoid a trade war and make her relationship with the US president functional again. 
She will be trying to persuade Trump to back off his dual threats of punitive metal tariffs that could spark a transatlantic trade war and his instinct to scrap the Iran nuclear deal. 
The German leaders visit has already been overshadowed by a backslapping three-day festival of fraternite between Donald Trump and French President Emmanuel Macron earlier this week. 
Aware of the optics, anxious German diplomats pressed, in vain, for Merkel to enjoy a similarly meaty two days at the White House, betting the face time would help sweeten difficult relations, officials told AFP. 
Just hours before the chancellor landed late Thursday, some 15 months after Trump was sworn into office, the Republican Congress finally got around to confirming an ambassador to Germany.

North and South Korea seek to end the Korean War after 68 years
	

The leaders of North and South Korea made a bold pledge Friday to work toward a common goal of denuclearizing their peninsula and formally ending the Korean War by the end of this year, following a historic day of talks on the border that has divided them for almost seven decades. 
It was a day marked by an astonishing level of congeniality between the two, including a warm embrace at the signing of what they called the Panmunjeom Declaration, after the border area where it was forged. It was, however, short on details as to what, exactly, denuclearization means for each of them. 
Still, the fact that Kim Jong Un and Moon Jae-in spent so much time together and came up with a joint statement that even includes the word denuclearization marks a surprising development after a year of threats and missile launches that brought the specter of war back to the Korean Peninsula. 
Kim became the first North Korean leader to step into the South for 65 years as he met with President Moon Jae-in for a peace summit. This afternoon, Kim and Moon embraced warmly after signing a statement in which they declared there will be no more war on the Korean Peninsula. The two countries said they will push for talks with the US, and potentially China, to officially end the 1950-53 conflict, which stopped with an armistice and left the Koreas still technically at war. 
They also agreed to rid their peninsula of nuclear weapons but did not provide any new specific measures outlining how to achieve the objective.

Russia parades Syrian witnesses
	

DAILY MAIL, 28th APRIL, 2018
Russia ratcheted up its efforts Thursday to try to disprove that a Syrian town was hit by a poison gas attack, bringing a group of Syrians, including an 11-year-old boy, to the global chemical weapons watchdogs headquarters to denounce the reports as fake. The U.S., Britain, France and their allies boycotted the event at the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, branding it as nothing more than a crude propaganda exercise and an obscene masquerade.
The Syrians were flown to Europe to tell their stories at the OPCW and then ushered into a roomful of reporters at a nearby hotel where they all repeated nearly identical accounts: There was no chemical attack in Douma, near Damascus, on April 7. Patients who visited the hospital suffering from asphyxiation had inhaled only smoke and dust. There were no chemical traces or smells. Panic was sparked when first responders entered the hospital and began yelling that chemical weapons had been used.

A large stock of chemicals was seized, while being taken to be mixed with tea at a secret location near a tea factory at Rangala, and a suspect arrested by STF personnel from the Ambakotte Camp in Digana.
Police said the suspect was one of the tea factory managers in charge of the chemical mixing plant and that the chemical was identified as C-Sweet Liquid Glucose 01155 and that not permitted to be mixed with tea leaves.
The STF seized the chemicals while in transit and on being interrogated, the driver provided information leading to raid on the secret location in the estate where the chemical was mixed to tea. Officials said a group of employees were mixing the chemical to a stock of tea when they carried out the raid. A senior STF official said the owner of the factory was a leading businessman of the area receiving political patronage and that he had been operating the racket for a long time.
The manager and samples of the chemical were handed over to the Rangala police for further investigations.

Three-month grace period given to British doc. to renew licence
	
In the wake of the controversy surrounding the British doctor who was performing heart surgeries at the Karapitiya Teaching Hospital, the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) yesterday decided to allow him a three-month grace period to obtain the practising licence from the General Medical Council (GMC) in the United Kingdom.
The Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) pulled up the case after noticing that British Cardiothoracic surgeon Dr. Richard Permin did not possess a licence to practice medicine in the UK as the licence needed to be renewed from time to time.
A spokesman for the SLMC told Daily Mirror that in the UK, doctors needed to be registered with its Medical Council and there is also a practising licence which needs renewing periodically.
He said however, unlike in the UK, only the SLMCs registration is needed to practice as a doctor in Sri Lanka and the SLMC had registered him in 2009 after which it has been renewed on a number of occasions.
In 2012, the UK introduced a new system where you could obtain a practising licence based on performance and a doctor cannot practice in UK without that licence. We have made inquiries from the GMC about this. Until recently, in the UK too you only need the GMC registration to practise, he said.
He said Dr. Permin had been registered with the GMC until 2019, however, his practising licence was valid only until 2015 and added that there was no need for such licence to practice medicine in Sri Lanka as being registered with the SLMC would suffice, a stipulation that he has fulfilled.
Since this issue had been raised, the SLMC has decided to give him three months to get his practising licence renewed. However, Dr. Permin has practised medicine in Sri Lanka since 2009. Therefore, we have decided to recommend that the Director General of Health Services institute action against him if there has been or is any issue with his practice which could risk patients lives in the future, he said.

US Senate approves Mike Pompeo to become secretary of state
	

DPA, 27th APRIL, 2018
The US Senate on Thursday confirmed Mike Pompeo as the nations top diplomat in an expected endorsement of US President Donald Trumps choice for secretary of state.
The 57-42 vote was largely along party lines, but a handful of Democrats joined majority Republicans in endorsing Pompeo, a foreign policy hawk who has served as Trumps director of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA).
Pompeo, a former officer in the US Army and former member of Congress from Kansas, was sworn in shortly after the vote and then departed on his first official foreign trip in his new position.
Pompeos first stop is Brussels, where he will meet with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg and participate in a meeting of NATO foreign ministers, who are to discuss preparations for Julys NATO summit, the State Department said.
The secretary will then travel to the Middle East, where he will meet with Saudi, Israeli and Jordanian leaders to discuss critical regional and bilateral issues, State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement.
The White House meanwhile released photos of Pompeo meeting North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. The secret meeting took place over the Easter weekend, spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said on Twitter.

Great to have Secretary Pompeo confirmed. He will do an excellent job helping @POTUS lead our efforts to denuclearize the Korean Peninsula, Sanders said.
The White House confirmed last week that Pompeo began laying the groundwork for a Washington-Pyongyang summit expected to take place in May or June.

## Title: Vesak Poya The global religious day for Buddhists

Vesak Poya The global religious day for Buddhists
	

At the instigation of the foreign minister, the late Lakshman Kadirgarmar, Vesak Full Moon Poya day was declared as an international religious day. This was done because it is the most important day for Buddhists world over due to a number of religious incidents that took place on this day.

Temangula
In Sinhalese Te means three. Mangula denotes auspicious occasions of good fame. Due to three incidents i.e., the last birth of the Bodhisattva as prince Siddhartha, the Enlightenment and Parinibbana, Vesak Full Moon Poya day is of special significance not only for Buddhists in Sri Lanka, but also for those living in other Asian countries including Nepal, India, Myanmar (Burma), Thailand (Siam), Japan, China, Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam, Tibet, Bangladesh, Maldives and Pakistan and many other countries in the Western world. 

The last birthof the Bodhisattva
The last birth of the Bodhisattva as prince Siddhartha took place on the Vesak Full Moon Poya day Two Thousand Six Hundred and eight years ago. He was born as the son of King Suddhodana of the kingdom of Kapilawasthu and queen Maha Maya. The queen was on her way to her parental palace in Devdaha. When she was resting at Lumbini Park under a Sal tree, accompanied by a mass of followers, prince Siddhartha was born. It is said that immediately after the princes birth the infant had walked on seven Lotus flowers which emerged before him. The queen had proceeded back to Kapilawasthu together with the newborn child. King Suddhodanas teacher, Saint Asitha Kaladewala, who visited the palace on the same day, asserted that the blessed prince was to be the savior of the universe and the teacher of every one in all the three worlds. He said that the Bodhisattva was to attain Buddhahood enabling him to direct the universe to the path of emancipation. 

First salutationof the father
The saint, who had developed meditation skills, envisaged that he was due to die before the Enlightenment of the Bodhisattva. The saint worshiped the newborn prince. The king who watched the behaviour of his teacher realized that his son was superior to the saint who had worshipped the Bodhisattva himself.
The prince was raised at the royal palace in the lap of luxury leaving no room for him to realize the vanity of worldly life. The king was anxious to see his son becoming the Universal king envisaged by the learned Brahmins at the naming ceremony. The kings Endeavour was to prevent the Bodhisattva from leaving the worldly life to attain Buddhahood in keeping with the words of Saint Kondanna who raised one finger and said that the prince was sure to attain the Buddhahood.

Renunciation
In spite of the precautionary measures taken by the king the prince came into direct contact with the stark realities of life, Satara Pera nimiti  a sick man, a decrepit old man, a corpse and a monk- which made him determined to become an ascetic. He left the palace refusing the luxuries including the crown, princess Yasodhara and the newborn son, prince Rahula.

Enlightenment
As a seeker of total emancipation he struggled for seven years and ultimately through his own efforts realized the truth. One happy Vesak night, as he was seated under the shade of the famous Peepal tree (Sri Maha Bodhi) at Buddha Gaya, with the mind tranquilized and purified, in the First watch he developed that supernatural knowledge which enabled him to remember his past lives Pubbe-nivasanussati Gnana.
In the Middle watch he developed the clairvoyant supernatural vision dealing with the death and rebirth of beings, Chutupapata Gnana- perception of the Disappearing and Reappearing of beings.
In the Last watch of the night he developed the supernatural knowledge with regard to the destruction of passions  Asavakkhaya Gnana and comprehending things as they truly are- and attained Perfect Enlightenment which is known as Samma Sambodhi.
He served the universe during a period of more than half a century as the Exalted One, the Omniscient One and the holiest of holies. He served all the three worlds, the world of gods, the world of men and the lower region- the world of demons where its inhabitants are liable to passions.
The Exalted One led the Universe to the eternal bliss with the highest knowledge realized by Him without any guidance. He gained this insight as a human being and He never posed Himself as a person with supernatural powers. He did not want His followers to believe in the existence of an almighty Creator God. He showed that man can serve himself.

Parinibbana
As a human being He served the universe and on a Vesak full moon poya day He attained Parinibbana at Upavattana Sal Park in Kusinara there by showing the world that nothing is permanent in the universe.

Niyata Vivaranaya
Niyata Vivaranaya The Positive explanation of the assurance of becoming Buddha was given to Gautama Bodhisattva for the first time by Deepankara Buddha on a Vesak Full Moon Poya day. In that birth Bodhisattva was born as ascetic Sumedha. The road was being cleared for the Buddha to pass that place. Ascetic Sumedha was among those who were preparing and decorating the road. He was expected to clean a patch on the road which was full of muddy. Buddha arrived at that place before ascetic Sumedha could repair the road. He did not want the Buddha to walk on the muddy road and he lay down on the muddy part of the road desiring the Buddha to walk over him. His decision was deep and sincere that Deepankara Buddha gave him Niyata Vivaranaya Positive explanation of assurance of attaining Buddhahood.

Twin miracles
It was on the Vesak Full Moon Poya day, exactly one year after the Enlightenment, that Sakyamuni Gautama Buddha performed the Yama Maha Perahera- Twin miracles in order to dispel the arrogance of His relatives.

Third visit to Sri Lanka
Apart from the above incidents Vesak Full Moon Poya day is of special significance to Sri Lankans because of the Enlightened Ones third visit to the country. In the eighth year after the Enlightenment Gautama Buddha visited Sri Lanka at the invitation of Naga King Maniakkhika of Kelaniya. Naga King Maniakkhika made this invitation when the Enlightened One visited Sri Lanka for the second time to quell a dispute between two groups of Nagas led by Chulodara and Mahodara. Naga King Maniakkhika, who had gone to Nagadeepa to support his nephew, Mahodara embraced Buddhism after listening to the Dharma preached by the Blessed One and invited the Buddha to visit his Kingdom  Kelaniya. In response to this invitation the Enlightened One had visited Kelaniya.

Invitation by God Sumana Saman
God Sumana Saman, who brought a Kiripalu tree from Seveth Nuwara Dewram Vehera to provide shelter to the Buddha during His second visit to Sri Lanka, accompanied Him to Sri Lanka during Gautama Buddhas third visit to the country. On his invitation Gautama Buddha proceeded to Samantakuta where He placed His footprint. This footprint remains in full sanctity and is being worshiped by us with extreme devotion.

Origin of the Sinhala Community
Furthermore Vesak Full Poya day is regarded as the day of the origin of the Sinhala Community. According to chronicles, Prince Vijaya with his followers, seven hundred in number, had disembarked at Tammanna. A coincidence is that Vijaya had set foot in Sri Lanka on the very day on which the Enlightened One had attained Parinibbana.
The female leader of the Yakkha clan who was presumably the leader of that part of the country had fallen in love with Vijaya and offered the throne to him. This was done with the hope of occupying the position of the queen. It is believed that Vijaya was thus enthroned as the first king of Lanka. 

Anointment of King Devanampiyatissa
King Devanampiyatissa was anointed for the second occasion on a Vesak Full Moon Poya day. Although he had been anointed earlier as the king of Lanka, after embracing Buddhism emperor Dharmasoka had anointed him again and had him installed as the king of the island.


Initiation of the work of Ruwanweliseya
According to chronicles King Dutugemunu had initiated the construction work of Ruwanweliseya on a Vesak Full Moon Poya day. It is to be noted that King Dutugemunu had made a statue with pure gold and had enshrined it in the Mahaseya with four Kurunis or gallon measures of relics.

Amisa puja and Pratipatti puja
The Vesak day observations take two forms -Amisa puja and Pratipatti puja. Amisa puja includes offerings including alms to Buddha and His followers  Maha Sangha and lay disciples  Upasaka Upasika. This is done by way of Dansal. Food donations are made to paupers, travelers or passers-by and animals. In addition to food other items such as medicinal drugs, clothes and money are included in Dana. Devotees engage in meditation and observe sil especially on this very important religious festive day.

## Title: Will America  go to war

Will America  go to war 
	



A speech by General George Patton, a famous World War 2 warrior, has an uncanny resemblance to the philosophy of Donald Trump. All real Americans love the sting and clash of battle. Americans love a winner and will not tolerate a loser -- Americans despise cowards. Americans play to win -- all the time. Thats why Americans have never lost, nor ever will lose a war, for the very thought of losing is hateful to Americans.

Then came the Korean War (a stalemate), Vietnam (a loss), Afghanistan (mired in unconquerable mountains), Iraq 2 (a quagmire).

Never mind the failures, with Trump in the saddle a new toughness is apparent. Hes in the middle of conflicts with North Korea, Russia, Iran, Syria, China, Yemen, Somalia, Libya, and in Niger and Mali. Fire and Fury, aimed at North Korea, is in danger down the road of becoming his mantra.

Recall that the US commander in Korea, General Douglas MacArthur, advocated using 34 nuclear weapons on targets in Korea and China. Polls today show that a majority of Americans would think it right to use them if America were attacked. Obama would never have pressed the button. I wouldnt be so sure about Trump sometime over the next few years.

Never mind the failures, with Trump in the saddle a new toughness is apparent. Hes in the middle of conflicts with North Korea, Russia, Iran, Syria, China, Yemen, Somalia, Libya, and in Niger and Mali



Where are the risks
Russia -- Trump has pushed for a fast build up of Americas military might, including nuclear weapons, even though America has a military expenditure as high as the combined total of Russia, China, Japan, Britain, France, Saudi Arabia and India. He has no plan to discuss arms cuts, to take missiles off hair-trigger alert nor to take up ex-president Dmitri Medvedevs important proposal for a new European Security Treaty. This would deal with Russias anger at the expansion of Nato up to its borders, while getting Russias soldiers out of Ukraine and ending its military manoeuvers in and around the Baltic.
Ukraine needs to be de-militarised but Trump has decided to arm the government with sophisticated weapons. To deal with rebel demands the reasonable request for decentralization - as practised in Britain - should be met.
China -- Trump has provoked China unnecessarily over Taiwan. This small island which has provided much of Chinas investment is claimed by Beijing to be part of China. It is not. But it should not, as a counter move, declare independence, a policy that Trump seems to lean to. Rather it should realize the quiet status quo is the only policy worth its weight.
Trump is aggravated by Chinese claims to islands in the South and East China seas. US warplanes already cross the borders of Chinas Air Defence Identification Zones. In the 1950s the US nearly went to war with China over the off-shore islands of Quemoy and Matsu, owned by Taiwan. President Dwight Eisenhower considered using nuclear weapons. Eventually China did pull back.
These days no one in their right mind wants to provoke a major war fought over tiny uninhabited islands. If this be true then the Pentagon should be ordered to take its military far away, so war cannot happen. On the economic front there is a danger that Trump is initiating a trade war which in the long run will lead to a US defeat. China has most of the cards. The total size of its economy is fast catching up with the US. It could buy its planes from Airbus rather than Boeing etc. It can start selling its vast savings in US Treasury bonds.
Iran- To Trump Iran is the source of all the problems of the Middle East: From Lebanon to Iraq to Yemen, Iran funds, arms and trains terrorists, militias and other extremist groups that spread destruction and chaos across the region. Trump has gone to great lengths to make sure Saudi Arabia benefits politically and militarily from his views, even though for years its government has permitted funds to be sent to Al Qaeda. Such an attitude undermines the job of making ISIS and Al Qaeda the primary targets, as they should be. It is Iran, Iran, Iran, even though Iran is a force for defeating extremists. Yet Iran can be negotiated with as the US discovered when it succeeded in sealing a highly important de-nuclearisation agreement. Trump wants to rip that accord open, even though he should know that North Korea will never trust a US deal if thats what happens two years later.
	North Korea -- Negotiations are now underway between the North and the US. If they work then that should be an example for how to deal with other problems. If they fail, then we should worry that Trump might lead us into a nuclear war.
With Obama, even though he made grave mistakes, one felt there was a momentum towards peace. With Trump it just seems to be, North Korea excepted at the moment, a momentum to war.
