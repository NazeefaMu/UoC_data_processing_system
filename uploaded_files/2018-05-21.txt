Demilitarisation
	
President Maithripala Sirisena is seen at a war heroes memorial day observance
?
he end of the war anniversary this month is once again polarizing the country. The losses are again being counted along ethnic lines, reinforcing notions of ?war heroes? and ?martyrs?. Remembering the war and the dead in this manner is providing few lessons and avenues towards seeking a peaceful and just future.? ?
?With the changing political dispensation in the South this year, a new constitution to address the issues that underlie the conflict are no longer in sight. In side stepping the issue of a political settlement, the doors are widening again for majoritarianism and jingoism in the South.? ?
?In the North, the Chief Minister and his speech at the remembrance in Mullivaikkal last week have reiterated the problematic discourse of genocide. This narrative of genocide denies the history of ethnic co-existence in this country, including during war-time, and seeks to construct an exclusionary and separatist future.? ?
?Among the many issues we should have addressed over the last many years, here I touch on the issue of demilitarization. Indeed, we are yet to have a national debate on the role of the military after the end of the war.? ?
?
"?Sadly, funds and finances are far more willingly allocated for war-making than reintegration?
and reconstruction? "
?
Defence expenditure
?While any country after a war should downsize its military, demilitarization is much more than that. In any event, reducing military numbers necessarily involves reintegrating the men and women in uniform with opportunities for civilian employment. But such opportunities for employment remain limited. The same goes for ex-combatants, including from the LTTE, who continue to be ostracised from local employment.? ?
?The families of the dead and disappeared have lost breadwinners. Their trauma of loss is amplified as many of them struggle to eke out a living. In this context, national efforts to rebuild their economic life, through employment and income generation have been lacking.? ? If one takes the national budget, defence expenditure still tops the list. Why is it that we have not thought about financing programmes with a part of those funds to reintegrate soldiers through education and civilian employment? Meanwhile, not even a minuscule fraction of the Tamil diaspora funding that came during the war has been channelled for post-war development of the North and the East. Sadly, funds and finances are far more willingly allocated for war-making than reintegration?
and reconstruction.? ?
Militarised institutions
?As we learned all too well during the years after 2009, militarization can take many forms, including the usurping of civilian institutions by the military. The merging of the Urban Development Authority (UDA) with the Defence Ministry characterized the institutionalization of militarized urbanization under the Rajapaksa Government. While the UDA was separated after regime change, military funded farms and pre-schools continue in the North to this day.? ?
?The security sector creeping into civilian institutions is not confined to the North. In recent weeks, steps have been taken to expand the role of the Kotelawala Defence University (KDU) in the higher education sector. Pushed through or not, these efforts to bring urban, rural and educational institutions under defence are worrying signs of a militarized mind-set.? ?
Occupied land
?As in many other parts of the world, militarization in Sri Lanka is very much linked to muscular nationalism. Post-war politics continue in that nationalist vein. There has been little self-criticism and reflection about how nationalist politics polarizes and oppresses, particularly women while claiming to protect them, and pushes generations of youth towards war and destruction. In the post-war years, nationalist mobilizations in tandem with end of war remembrances and opportunistic electioneering, have kept communities insecure.? ?
?
"Remembering war-time loss and destruction must go hand in hand with calls for material changes; from demilitarizing institutions to setting post-war development priorities?and initiatives"
?A recent report in The Hindu (18 May 2018) included data on the spread of military occupied lands in the North and the East, and is reproduced here. Much of the discussion on demilitarization, in the North in particular, has been about military occupation. Despite the swathes of land still under the military, significant areas have been released in recent times; including the Myliddy Fisheries Harbour in 2017 and 683 acres in Palaly last month. Furthermore, people?s struggles have been crucial for demanding land releases. Last month, the displaced people of Iranatheevu, an island off Kilinochchi occupied by the Navy for decades, took it upon themselves to return and reclaim their own.? ?
The government needs to release more military occupied land, particularly in Jaffna where land is scarce. In Jaffna, close to 15,000 families, ten percent of the households in the District, are absolutely landless. However, even the release of military occupied lands is unlikely to change their situation. Indeed, these landless families displaced multiple times during the war are the most deprived in northern society, but they do not even qualify for the post-war housing grants by the Government.? ?
?The very actors who strongly advocate for the release of military occupied land, rarely talk about landlessness in the post-war North. Ironically, Tamil nationalists raise concerns about the presence of the military but ignore the predicament of the landless and the marginalized, the very people who were cannon fodder during the war. In the South and the North, territorialism and militarism are occupying the minds as well.? ?
?Remembering war-time loss and destruction must go hand in hand with calls for material changes; from demilitarizing institutions to setting post-war development priorities and initiatives. However, in these fraught times of nationalist resurgence, we have to emphasize changing the mind-set in the country towards demilitarization.? ? ?
Tamils in the North remember their lost kin

Emissions from N'cholai Power Plant: No apparent effect on Sri Maha Bodhi
	
Emissions from the Norochcholai Power Plant do not appear to have caused any adverse effect to the sacred Sri Maha Bodhi in Anuradhapura but a scientific test should be carried out to obtain a clearer picture, Energy expert Dr. Tilak Siyambalapitiya said today.
He said the government should obtain the services of a foreign analyst to determine the correct situation.
?An environment impact study should be carried out before constructing a power plant and I am fully aware that such a study was conducted on the location where the coal power plant is situated in Norochcholai before beginning the construction work and showed no adverse impact on the environment at that time. However, we don?t know whether the weather pattern had changed the situation. Therefore further scientific studies should be carried out,? Dr. Siyambalapitiya said.
He said the sacred Bo sapling was brought down from a tree at Buddha Gaya, in the State of Bihar in India and pointed out that there were several coal mines and coal power plants located in Bihar. ?If the emissions of coal power plants is damaging it should affect the sacred Bo tree in Buddha Gaya. However there does not seem anything wring at the moment,? Dr. Siyambalapitiya said and added that the Bo-trees in Pettah and in Borella are free from any impact from the emission of sulfur dioxide from vehicles.
?Experts such as meteorologists and botanists and others should carry out an investigation on all these Bo trees including the ones in Buddha Gaya, Sri Maha Bodhi and the Bo trees in Pettah and Borella to determine the real situation,? Dr. Siyambalapitiya said.
However, he said the biggest issue with regard to Norochcholai is the breakdown of the emission control system. ?The plant came to a standstill recently as a result of the break down in the emission control system of the plant. The plant had to be shut down during the National New Year for for maintenance work. However, since the country depends much on this plant there might be instances where the authorities will not be able to shout the plant down even to maintain the emission control system. One could imagine what would happen in such a situation,? he said and added that the emission would be greater when the system is not maintained properly. (Yohan Perera)

GMOA blames Epidemiology Unit for its silence
	
Government Medical Officers? Association (GMOA) today said that the Epidemiology Unit is inactive and had not taken sufficient measures to mitigate the spreading viral flu in Southern Province.
Addressing a press conference GMOA Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge said the units?s inactiveness was due to appointing a person with lack of technical knowledge of the subject as Chief Epidemiologist.
He said though the suspicious Influenza flu wreck havoc in Southern Province the Epidemiology Unit had failed to issue a precautionary guideline.
Dr. Aluthge said false information had been widespread due to the inactiveness of the Epidemiology Unit which is the responsible authority to mitigate such situation.
GMOA request the Health Minister to appoint a responsible Epidemiology Unit spokesman in order to prevent false information and to create awareness of safety precautions.
?Although its a serious situation, the Epidemiology Unit yet seems to have following a silent policy over the matter. According to report so far 13 killed only in Galle and Matara districts. Earlier, Epidemiology Unit were capable of controlling such situation within a week, ? he added.
Dr. Aluthge further said the Health Services Director-General and the Provincial Health Director were seen making contradictory statements of the disease stating it was a result of not having a centralized mechanism or institution to respond in a such situation.
GMOA request the public to avoid in sending their kids with viral symptoms to schools? in order to control the virus spreading.
As the virus spreads through saliva and? air, GMOA instructs to use a mask and wash hands properly to protect from the infection. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

Good Governance and Role of Religion: Religion, Govt. need to be separated
	
To change or not to change the constitution does not fall within the ambit of Religion. All Religious dignitaries should be kept away from engaging directly in politics. Let?s make Sri Lanka a secular state. If? we leave all religions out of our constitution, true Buddhism would flourish again in this thrice-blessed land. Politics and religion should never be allowed to mix, for it will lead to spontaneous combustion. The astute politicians makes maximum use of this situation in order to keep themselves in power.? ?
20th Amendment
A section of Buddhist Monks styled? ?Maha Sangha?, recently insisted on the president and prime minister not to move forward the JVP proposed 20th? Amendment to the Constitution calling for the abolishing of the executive presidency, arguing it was an attempt to divide the nation.??
Politicians? today are only concerned in holding into positions and power and will forever revere and protect the Bikkhus to show that they are with the Buddhist majority. Should religion be above the law? Buddhist monks will carry on committing all kinds of anti-Buddhist acts under the cover of? the saffron robe abusing the influence of Buddhism on the political process of the country. By their actions, they are doing more harm to Buddhism and the nation.
The? way Sri Lankan Bhikkhus engage in politics or political process non-Buddhists in other countries are under the impression that Buddha was a politician and Buddhism is nothing but governance.? ?
Today? a small section of the Buddhist monks seemed to be betraying the Dhamma as taught by the Enlightened One. Just a few are intelligent enough to comprehend this fact where as a significant majority are silent on the anti-Buddhist behavior by this few monks.? It is the foremost duty of the Maha Nayake Theras of the four sectors, if they are unable to discipline the Buddhist monks who breach and disobey the Dhamma values and ethics, at least name them.?
No person should be allowed to hold religious, political office at the same time?
Religion? and government can protect and encourage one another if they travel parallel tracks but not on the same.? Religion and state both require to be free and independent in order to thrive. They are most successful and effective when they protect and support one another. Any religion or religion-based Parties that enters politics should lose all state privileges and be treated as a private entity. It should not be the government?s business to promote any religion. There is also the practice of making religion compulsory at exams.??
Teaching Religion in Schools
The? kids should be taught basics of all religions at the primary level, so that they will on their own initiative make a comparative study of religious doctrines or principles without being automatically brainwashed to accept a religion imposed upon them by others. Buddha was specific on this aspect of understanding or comprehending his proclamation.? They can learn a religion of parent?s choice at home or at Daham Pasal.? Answering the Kalamas, Buddha emphasized on the importance of not accepting any teaching blindly.??
To summarize the engagement: Puzzled? Kalamas said to the Blessed One, ?There are some brahmans who expound and glorify their own doctrines?doctrines of others they deprecate them, show contempt. Other Brahmans glorify their own doctrines, but doctrines of others, they deprecate them?, this leaves us totally uncertain and in doubt:? Who is speaking the truth, and who are lying???
Buddha? replied, Traditions should not to be followed simply because they are traditions; Reports, historical accounts? are not to be accepted simply because the basis seems reliable. Own preferences which seem rational or resonate with one?s thoughts not to be accepted? view or faith must be tested by putting into practice; and guarded against biases or limitations in one?s understanding of results, but further checked against the experiences of wise. Even my own words, you should question and test in an appropriate way.? Why not allow the children follow the Buddha word?
Who is a ?Sinhala Buddhist??
Our religious leaders? priority should be to preach? Dhamma and guide Buddhists in the right? path according to Buddha?s teachings.
Buddha? ?used the term Bhikku to call Monks in Suttas. The meaning of Bhikku is ?one who lived by alms?. In Buddha?s time 25 centuries ago they had to go to cemeteries? to collect cloth used to wrap dead bodies, use saffron to disinfect and dye them before stitching robes by themselves. In today?s context one cannot expect the Maha Sangha to practice such austerity. However,? what we call Buddhism today is nothing what Gauthama Buddha has preached.?
They? must not tarnish the real Buddhism by calling themselves ?Sinhala Buddhists?, which is a nonsensical combination of terms.? According to Dhamma there is no race, caste or creed.? ?Sinhala-Buddhist? is a misnomer. They confuse Buddhism with the Sinhala race, which are two different issues.
Buddhist Council--Dharma Sangayana?
Time is ripe to summon Buddhist Council [Dharma Sangayana] to sort out issues mainly concerning discipline among the bikkhus. The Mahanayake Theras? are either? not worried or that they? have no power over the young rebellious monks. This situation cannot be reversed within a short time as it is tied up with politics. During D.S. Senanayake?s time, he was able to silence even the Maha Nayaka Theras.
In 1947 December, when DS and Sir Ivor Jennings? were drafting the Soulbery Constitution for Independent Ceylon, they decided to drop the article introduced by the Colonial authorities on? ?Foremost Place for Buddhism? in 1815 Kandyan Convention.? ?The two prelates of Siyam Maha Nikaya in Kandy threatened to boycott inaugural ceremony scheduled to be held in Kandy in protest. Leader of the House DS summoned the two Nayake Theras to GA?s resident to discuss the matter. However, upon the Diyawadene Nilame?s intervention DS agreed to meet them in the Maligawa instead, where he convinced the two Prelates on the importance of treating all religions and ethnic groups on equal grounds quoting the Buddha word on ?equality?.? Being convinced, the Malwatte and Asgiriya Prelates agreed to attend the ceremony.? The spineless leaders except for a few who succeeded him gave into every irrelevant demand of the Buddhist monks.??
Only? a few political leaders had the foresight and the ?spine? to ask the Maha Sangha not to dip into politics; they were DS Senanayake, J R Jayewardene, and to a certain extent Mahinda Rajapaksa. The former two warned that the Maha Sangha should keep away from politics.
DS? ?had the courage to tell the Maha Sangha, where to get off.? Mahinda Rajapaksa succeeded in keeping the Mahanayake Theras at abeyance when the Mahanayake Theras quite appropriately, in this instance? summoned a Sangha Council in support of Sarath Fonseka during his arrest and jailing. Prompted by MR, the Sangha who belonged to Siyam Chapter from the South threatened to leave the Nikaya en masse in case the Sangha council met.?
A? few radical monks have distorted the Buddha Dhamma with their hatred towards other ethnic and religious groups, yet the Nayake Theras and the guardians of law, have failed to discipline a few group of Bhikkus who unleash communal violence. The Mahanayakes announced their disagreement on appointing Vesak in April only a week before the appointed day, probably they have been busy meeting politicians, the rogues and those indirectly supporting rogues who come in procession to seek their blessings.
?
"Only? a few political leaders had the foresight and the ?spine? to ask the Maha Sangha not to dip into in politics; they were DS Senanayake, J R Jayewardene, and to a certain extent Mahinda Rajapaksa. The former two warned that the Maha Sangha should keep away from politics"
?Governments? ?cooperate in protecting and preserving religious autonomy and in nurturing the role of religions in the social order. Most states guarantee their citizens the right to perform their religious activities according to the order of their own moral principles.?
Morality? ?plays a vital role in preserving and promoting good governance. Genuine solution to many of the grave problems facing us are not political, but spiritual. Racism, violence, and hatred are all spiritual problems. Good governance protects all religions; and good religions support good citizenship.? Good governance does not promote or favour one religion over another. Similarly, good religious leaders should not take sides with any political party.??
Some governments impose a state religion. Religious belief and observance separated, though, it should be protected and defended against maltreatment. Giving one religion special rights that are deprived to others can weaken sacred pluralism. The initial reference here is to Buddhist vision of an ideal state in which members of various ethnic, religious, racial, or social groups uphold and develop their conventional culture within the confines of a general society. The principle preached by the Buddha is not one founded on ?Political Philosophy?.? It is not a doctrine that encourages men to worldly delight. It sets out a way to achieve Nibbana or in other words, its final aim is to put an end to desire. If a Buddhist monk is involved in politics, he should not? misuse the religion to gain the political powers.?
Monk also has to maintain his duty on behalf of the state, nation and religion. They should pay attention critically without engaging in politics completely and to become the counselors of the rulers for good governance. Buddha did not envisage setting up a ?Buddhist nation? in any part of the globe or a Buddhist city, not even within Kimbulwatpura!

IS THERE A BREAKDOWN IN GOVERNANCE? - EDITORIAL
	
he coalition government led by the UNP and a faction of the SLFP led by President Sirisena in the so-called ?National Unity? government came into power in January 2015 -a coming together of two political forces which have since their creation been diametrically opposed to each other.? ?
Unfortunately the coming together of two diametrically opposed political forces without either a common ideology or pragmatic programme of work was bound to flounder. And so it has come to pass.? ?
In the aftermath of the governing coalition?s defeat at the local government elections to the new political formation -the SLPP, led by immediate past President Rajapaksa, the unity government seems to be unravelling at the seams and the country descending into anarchy. The President and the Prime Minister of the unity government seem to be working to undermine each other. In the absence of governance, different power groupings are seen to be taking matters into?
their hands.? ?
The primary duty of any government is to govern. Yet governance in the country today, has seemingly taken a back seat. One classic example is that of the doctors? trade union. Today this grouping is using helpless patients as human shields so-to-say in their attempts to dictate terms to government regarding Free Trade Agreements and other matters of state. The doctors grouse there could be an influx of foreign medical doctors which would help relieve abysmal the patient to doctor ratio in?
the country!? ?
Students of government universities have joined hands with doctors? trade unions to dictate that the shortage of doctors-to-patients ratio in the country should not be be solved via the introduction of private medical universities, even though the state universities cannot fill this critical need.? ?
Media reports inform us a few Deputy Inspectors General of Police have dictated to the President, that they do not want a particular individual - who is known as a strict disciplinarian - as Minister of Law and Order at a time when corruption in the country is rife and the law and order situation at an extremely low depth.? ?
This, despite the fact, the fight against corruption was supposedly one of the main planks of the present regime?s election platform! The regime which came into power in 2015 on an anti-corruption and law and order brief, seems helpless in facing down non-state power centres?
and gangsterism.? ?
Perhaps it is time we took a leaf out of the book regarding events taking place in Malaysia. A scarce week ago, the party that had been governing Malaysia since it was granted independence on August 31, 1957 - 61 years ago - was voted out of power. The incoming regime campaigned on a platform of wiping out corruption, bringing to justice the miscreants who were accused of robbing the country and freeing of the main opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim who was jailed on trumped up charges. On the day of victory, the first steps were taken to have Ibrahim freed vide a royal pardon. When the man accused of defrauding Malaysia attempted to leave the country, his passport was impounded. He was restrained from fleeing. His residences were raided and millions in ill-gotten wealth seized. In next to nought, Anwar Ibrahim was freed and the newly-elected Prime Minister has promised to fulfill his election promise of resigning and handing over the reigns of power to Anvar Ibrahim within two years.? ?
We, in Sri Lanka, made the regime change come true in January 2015. Our newly-elected leaders pledged to wipe out big time financial crime, bring the accused to justice, bring down the cost of living and change the?
Constitution etc.? ?
Instead the regime that promised to end big-time financial crime, stands accused of similar - if not a bigger fraud. Three years later, not a single perpetrator of large-scale fraud has been brought to justice. A few small fry stood accused.? ?
Our President who pledged he would not seek re-election, has changed his mind.? ?
The cost of living is spiralling. Only the reduction of presidential powers and incorporation of a Freedom of Information Act stands to our leaders credit.? ?
Sadly, what Malaysia was able to achieve within a week, Sri Lanka has not been able to in over three years.? ?
The lesson we can learn from the Malaysian experience is that ?...if there?s a will, there?s?

Mangala knows I can, that?s why false propaganda: Gota
	
Former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa on Sunday said Finance Minister Mangala Samaraweera was spreading false propaganda against him because the minister was aware of his ability.
He recalled how Minister Samaraweera pasted posters against Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe during the time of President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga.
?Recently, Minister Samaraweera said he knew Mr. Wickremesinghe could perform well and that was why he pasted posters against Mr.Wickremesinghe. Similarly, he has initiated a false propaganda campaign against me and I can say this is because he knows I can,? Mr. Rajapaksa told an event organised by the Federation of National Organisations in Badulla.
He said the minister?s special statement which said Gotabhaya Rajapaksa was the most corrupt and dangerous government official and should not be brought to power had been issued amid many crises on the economic front.
?The government has increased taxes and the prices of essential items. There is no development in any sector. Businessmen and entrepreneurs are going through a difficult time while local and foreign investors get discouraged. Minister Samaraweera who is responsible for these, issues a special statement about me. When he was the Foreign Minister, he went to Geneva and co-sponsored a resolution against the country even without informing the President. After he was appointed Finance Minister, taxes were imposed as per the needs of the IMF and the cost of living increased. Without replying to these issue, he uses his old Goebbels theory, thinking that people can be taken for a ride. We need to oust selfish politicians and elect those who can work for the betterment of the country,? Mr. Rajapaksa said.
He said Minister Samaraweera approached him several weeks prior to the presidential election in 2014 with the intention of joining then president Mahinda Rajapaksa.
?In 2014, two weeks before calling for nominations for the presidential elections, an associate of Mr. Samaraweera named Ruwan Ferdinandez phoned me and said he wants to meet me. He said I have to bring all elements together to strengthen Mahinda Rajapaksa for the presidential election. He said Mangala Samaraweera is ready work with me to join the government, to which I replied saying I?m a secretary and therefore, Mr. Samaraweera should contact president Mahinda Rajapaksa. Then, Mr. Ferdinandez said I?m the most reliable person in the then government and the arrangements should be made with my intervention. I said I will inform the President but the rest is up to him and Mr. Samaraweera. After that, discussions were held between president Rajapaksa and Mr. Samaraweera who requested the ministerial portfolios of Foreign and Justice. Another set of meetings were held with Basil Rajapaksa and another friend of Mr. Samaraweera submitted their requirements in writing. The then president rejected the request and therefore, Mangala went against Mahinda Rajapaksa. These kind of politicians have no principles and their concern is their own benefit and not the country. At the end of 2014, Gotabhaya Rajapaksa was the most reliable person in the government and was ready to work with him in order to join that government. Today, statements are being issued saying Gotabhaya Rajapaksa is the most corrupt out of the fear that I would come to power. These politicians put personal needs first and they attempt to retain power by any means. We know this person was a minister in many governments.What did he do? I have done more than him during the two and half years I was given to develop Colombo,? Mr. Rajapaksa said.
He said the previous government didn?t keep pointing fingers at people or locked horns with political opponents.
?We had work to do. We didn't keep blaming the Opposition or fight with political opponents. We were fighting with the ruthless terrorists who killed innocent civilians and damaged properties,? he said.
He said what the country requires at the moment is a team who can work efficiently, identify policies and challenges in order to create polices to face those challenges.
?We shouldn't wait until the last moment to create policies after coming to power,? Mr. Rajapaksa said. ?
Meanwhile, he said the government keeps opening projects almost completed by the previous government in order to score points.
He also said there is no national security in the country today. ?The country should be stable and the security should be established in order to develop the country. Otherwise, no investor will come to Sri Lanka,? he said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

Peacocks, dreams and the children of Saturn
	
	Jean Arasanayagam is one of the best known Lankan poets and easily the best known internationally
	
	
	She is less well known as a prose writer, though she has no less than twelve works of fiction and non-fiction to her credit;
	
	
	Bhairava: A childhood in Navaly State Literary Award for non-fiction in 1984
	
	
	It is about her husband?s childhood days in the village of Navaly in Jaffna in the 1940s and 50s.?
	
?
Jean Arasanayagam is one of the best known Lankan poets and easily the best known internationally now that Patrick Fernando, Anne Ranasinghe and Lakshmi de Silva are no more.
She is less well known as a prose writer, though she has no less than twelve works of fiction and non-fiction to her credit; hence, coming across a reprint of her Peacocks and Dreams while browsing at the Public Library was a delight.
The book, which won the State Literary Award for non-fiction (as ?Bhairava: A childhood in Navaly) in 1984,? ?is about her husband?s childhood days in the village of Navaly in Jaffna in the 1940s and 50s.?
Reading it, you feel there isn?t much of a difference between her poetry and her prose. The whole narrative reads like a prose poem. Take for example the following passages.
?You know then, pain, and you toss on the mat with the cloth drawn up to your armpits dreaming of the churning milk sea and the great serpent spitting out venom, while the nagas and naginis roam the bare land, desolate, in the walawu.
?Nobody cared whether you grew up or not, like a root you sprouted from the palmyrah seed flung down in the grove among the bitter yellow-brown vembu flowers, but you saw gods and goddesses, Amman combing her hair, stands alight with sun, Bhairava, Siva, walking within the Kailasa of your dreams.?
?
"There is no such thing as superstition in this context. This book takes me back to my own childhood years when the world was shared by demons, gods, ghosts and people alike"
The society she describes has vanished, but not in cultural essentials such as religious fervour and ritual. Many of the nineteen chapters are concerned with Hindu rites, rituals, festivals and architecture. We see life as lived then through the eyes of schoolboy Arjun, who may be a fictitious version of her husband. The Amman temple is discovered via Arjun and his friends who go there to pluck ichampalam.
There is a Bhairava image under the tamarind tree near the temple. As he watches, the spiked iron trident begins to move, making him fear the power of Bhairava.
There is no such thing as superstition in this context. This book takes me back to my own childhood years when the world was shared by demons, gods, ghosts and people alike.?
But one feels that Arjun soaks up the culture of Jaffna through the eyes of Jean Arasanayagam, whose attempts to bring east and west together culturally with a monumental personal commitment (as a Burgher writer married to a Tamil academic) remains unparalleled in our literature. As the following passage shows, she is obviously dazzled by what she saw.
?
"Reading it, you feel there isn?t much of a difference between her poetry and her prose. The whole narrative reads like a prose poem"
?You remember the table spread with red-hot portals and the fresh keerai leaves piled up for cutting, the small peeled red onions filling the coconut shells, the fish and vegetables sliced sharply against the upthrust blade of the ariwharl, to cook, simmering in milk on wood fires. Your mother fed you with myths, legends, reciting those epics of the gods while she moulded balls of rice in her hands from the steaming mound on the plantain leaf, but the years passed and the pettagams hissed with emptiness, the staring weevils creeping about in the residual dust left behind from the harvested years, the fields sold off, one by one, dowry for a younger sister grown late for marriage; then there were no more harvests to be gathered in, no red rice to give you strength; no straw bales for you to drowse on and the women ceased to come with their reed baskets to peck like birds at those rich seams of grain mice-garnered and packed into the earth.?
Here she has encapsulated, in prose which shimmers like well-crafted verse, the spirit of a rural, agrarian society, its culinary rituals based on grain and victuals and kitchen utensils which are now museum pieces, its worldly goods and fragile wealth, and the organic cycle of life where even the households insects and rodents have their role to play.
This book isn?t one of those sunny romps across an exotic culture. There is humour, too, but a darker side of childhood in rural Jaffna emerges.
In the chapter titled the Butterfly Wars and the Children of Saturn, children massacre butterflies, focused like little demons waging war on beauty.?
But the most interesting episode is perhaps the one about school, and Arjun?s eccentric schoolmaster Perambalam who likes to show off his biceps rolls little pellets of opium from his ?duppi? when he thinks his students aren?t watching and takes sadistic relish in caning the more vulnerable of his wards.
It makes for fascinating reading.

Rainfall of more than 300mm in some areas
	
The heavy rains in the onset of the Southwest Monsoon has exceeded 300mm in some areas by this morning, the Department of Meteorology said.
It said the highest rainfall of 353.8mm was recorded from Anamaduwa while rainfalls of 339mm and 302mm were reported from Andigama and Kamalsram in the Puttalam district.
Heavy rains were reported in number of other areas as well with Matale having a rainfall of 267.5mm, Kudawa in Ratnapura district 236.6mm, Kuliyapitiya 232mm and Horagasgara in the Puttalam District having a rainfall of 232mm.
Meanwhile, Kukuleganga in Kalutara had a rainfall of 227mm, Dummalasuriya 217.4mm and Delwala in the Ratnapura district a rainfall 203.5mm.
When asked whether the 353.8mm rainfall in Anamaduwa was the highest in the country's history, a Met Department spokesman said Sri Lanka had received much higher rainfalls in the past.
?The country has had rains of more than 700mm in the past in Deniyaya while the Kalutara district received a rainfall of 500mm last year,? he said.
The reason for the heavy rains was said to be an atmospheric disturbance brought about by the Southwest Monsoon.
The Met Department forecast heavy rains in the Sabaragamuwa, Western, Central, North Western provinces the Galle and Matara Districts in the next few days. (Yohan Perera)

About 30 senior forensic specialists and policymakers from?the regional countries would gather in Colombo for the third Asia Conference on Regional Cooperation and Policy Development in Management of the Dead in Emergencies on May 22 and 23, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said on Monday.?
Forensic experts from Afghanistan, Bangladesh, India, Indonesia, Nepal, Pakistan, Timor Leste, Vietnam and Sri Lanka would take part in the two-day summit organized by the ICRC.
The participants are associated with regional disaster management agencies, Red Cross and Red Crescent societies and other organizations working in this field.?
?They will discuss mechanisms to strengthen medico legal systems because these play a key role in identifying victims, the needs of families and relatives of disaster victims and the requirements of teams involved in response activities,? the ICRC said.
It said the aim of the conference is to identify ways to continue to develop policies and strategies for the management of the dead in emergencies.
ICRC?s head of delegation in Sri Lanka, Gerard Peytrignet?said in Asia, thousands of people die or go missing during disasters, both natural and man-made.
?Their families suffer terribly due to the uncertainty about what has happened to their loved ones. People who are unable to restore contact or trace the missing relatives live in an emotional limbo, not sure whether a parent or a sibling or a child is dead or alive. This uncertainty often prevents them from mourning properly or resuming their life, until they know what has happened to their loved one,??he said. ?
Dignified and proper management of the dead in disasters is fundamental to helping families establish the whereabouts of their relatives and mourn their death, the ICRC said.

Vannamei Shrimp Farming, not detrimental to environment or health, say, experts
In the wake of several print media reports firing warning shots across the bows to Vannamei Shrimp (King Prawn) farming, Taprobane Seafood Group -- Sri Lanka?s largest seafood company with a strength of over 1,200 direct employees and eight processing facilities -called for a press briefing last Sunday (13) at Akash Hotel in Mannar to enlighten the attendees on the entire practice and socio-economic concerns over Vannamei Shrimp farming.??
According to the officials at Taprobane Seafood, recent media backlash that ignited outrage amongst everyone from the fisherfolk to the common man has been based on unfounded rumours so much so that people have already developed an aversion to pathogen-free Vannamei shrimp, which provenly does not have any adverse health effects.
?We deem the negative criticism received is solely due to unawareness of Vannamei Shrimp farming. We are extremely concerned about the safety of shrimps and have an obligation to act for the benefit of the society at large.?All our ponds are lined with High-Density Polyethylene (HDPE) sheets even though our land and groundwater are salty/sour.
?We use probiotics in the culture pond itself. They are beneficial bacteria, which have a very short lifespan of 5-7 days. These probiotics utilise the shrimp?s digested waste, uneaten feed if any, and moulting shells as their food source.
?With the assistance of the Government and authorities, the industry will be worth more than USD 1 billion by 2020.
?
"We deem the negative criticism received is solely due to unawareness of Vannamei Shrimp farming. We are extremely concerned about the safety of shrimps and have an obligation to act for the benefit of the society at large"
?It will create thousands of job opportunities in both the North and North-Western Provinces. We also hope to launch an out-grower scheme beneficial to the surrounding communities,? an official said.
Meanwhile, several international consultants, who refuted the allegations levelled against Vannamei Shrimp farming said those, who protested were oblivious to the entire project and that outdated idea still lurked in their hearts and minds. Addressing the gathering, aquaculture expert Senthil Kumar underscored the significance of Vannamei Shrimp farming and the pivotal role it could play in booming the socio-economic sectors. ?People are seemingly hostile towards this initiative because they are unaware of the process and of its tangible and intangible benefits. Presently, shrimp culture covers a total coastline of 1,700 kilometres. ?NAQDA says though Sri Lanka produced 3,820 tonnes in 1999, the production has dwindled to 1,570 tonnes in 2005. However, the Extraordinary Gazette notification issued on 08.03.2017 by the Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Ministry has identified 9,055.8 Ha (22,639.5 Acres) of land for aquaculture development. Native to the tropical marine habitats of the Eastern Pacific, Vannamei has a huge potential in flourishing the local economy as shrimp exports have plummeted year-on-year, owing to the inability to meet the rising demand of export quality shrimp.
?Currently, Sri Lanka views Black Tiger, a marine crustacean, as the ?only choice? in business, though in reality, Vannamei is key to fisheries export growth. Countries like India, Thailand and Saudi Arabia have demonstrated a steep growth in shrimp exports as they introduced Vannamei and discontinued to ship Black Tiger mainly due to health concerns. There is also a huge demand in exports to the US market,? he said.??
Mr Kumar stated that after years of research in a Hawaiian University, the US in 1990 introduced Specific Pathogen Free (SPF) Vannamei Shrimps in a bid to eschew Black Tiger, which is prone to various forms of causative and microorganisms, virus, fungi and bacterium.??
Furthermore, a recent report on Vannamei shrimp farming, prepared by Professor J.M.P.K. Jayasinghe of the Livestock Fisheries and Nutrition Faculty at the Wayamba University, concludes that Vannamei shrimp farming is not just viable, but also doesn?t pose any threat to the environment, food safety, social and animal welfare, as farms are constructed in accordance with international, certified and audited Best Aquaculture Practices (BAP).
Members of the Fisheries Cooperative Federation wrote to President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe seeking support to develop Vannamei shrimp farming in the?
Northern Province

Sri Lankan Johann Peries Close to Mt. Everest summit
	
Johann Peries, Sri Lanka?s famed mountaineer and adventurer, is set to make his ascent to the peak of Mount Everest in a few days.
If the weather cleared, Johann was to leave Base Camp on Saturday, May 19, climbing up to Camp 3 by Monday, May 21 and on to Camp 4 by the next day, before making his bid for the summit on Wednesday May 23.
Johann has been in the Himalayas since April, when he began his Everest expedition as part of a larger team led by International Mountain Guides (IMG), a globally renowned mountaineering company, with more than a dozen successful Mt. Everest Expeditions.?
For the past few weeks, Johann has been performing a series of climbing rotations, which prepare the climbers for higher altitudes and the Himalayan terrain.
Johann has completed three such training rotations, climbing all the way up to Camp 3 which is 7,162m above sea level and the fourth highest peak in the world.?
He has also been undergoing a series of ladder training exercises and other glacier-trekking exercises to help him prepare for the final stage of his?Everest climb.
?
"?Johann is almost there this time. He is expected to leave Base Camp? before making his bid for the summit on Wednesday?May 23"
Johann and other climbers have been experiencing bad weather throughout the current climbing season, and it is hoped the jet streams at the summit will ease in time for the final?
summit ascent.
This last phase of Johann?s climb is the most treacherous and also most challenging ? the area beyond Camp 4 and the Summit is known as the Death Zone because of its perilous conditions, where strong winds, narrow plateaus, steep ridges await the climbers and because in this zone the organs of the body start to slowly shut down because of the depleted oxygen saturation in the air.
Johann has been in intense training for this climb since December 2017. This is Johann?s second attempt to summit Mount Everest. In April 2016, he and Jayanthi Kuru-Utumpala were the first Sri Lankans to attempt to summit the peak, but Johann was forced to turn back at 8,400m, a mere 448m short of reaching the summit, due to technical difficulties with his equipment.
Kuru-Utumpala went on to complete the climb, becoming the first Sri Lankan to scale Mt. Everest.
Encouraging Johann on this second Everest bid is the ?Climb Everest with Johann? campaign, which has drawn the support of hundreds of Sri Lankans through its dedicated website.
?The campaign allows Johann?s Fellow-Sri Lankans to sponsor each step he takes on the mountain for Rs.100 a step. The cost of Johann?s expedition is estimated to amount to USD 58,600 and each sponsored step goes towards these costs.
Johann has dedicated this Everest Expedition to all Sri Lankans, and he is hopeful of raising the Sri Lankan Flag at the Everest Summit in a few days.

Viral disease in South: Pre and primary schools closed
	
All preschools in the Southern Province will remain closed this week while the primary section of other schools?situated in the areas where the disease is spreading?will be closed for two-days from tomorrow?because of an unidentified disease spreading in the Province, Provincial Education Ministry said today.
Provincial Education Secretary Y. Wickramasiri said all preschools would be close from May 22 to May 27 while the primary section of schools will be closed tomorrow?and on Wednesday.
Several children under one year and elderly people who were infected with the unidentified viral disease have died and at least 600 people are receiving treatment at several hospitals in the region.
However, Chief Epidemiologist Anil Dissanayake today ruled out the need to close the schools in the Southern Province as a precautionary measure amid the viral flu spreading in the area.
He said the spread of the disease and its resultant complications had been contained to a great extent and said the affected patients showed symptoms of influenza and flu.
Mr. Dissanayake said this after a three-member team which included two epidemiologists led by him visited the Matara District to check the situation there and said there was no increase in the number of patients. (Darshana Sanjeewa and Thilanka Kanakarathna)

## Title: War crimes charges Sri Lanka Army takes battle to propaganda front

War crimes charges Sri Lanka Army takes battle to propaganda front
	
?
Sri Lankan armed forces have not been in the habit of talking about themselves,? even during the 30-year war,? or after, when sinister allegations of misconduct were (and still are) levelled against them. Army Commander Lt. Gen. Mahesh Senanayake?s recent forthright media interaction with Colombo-based foreign correspondents therefore came as an eye-opener about the activities, outlook, military culture and future plans of the Sri Lanka Army (SLA).?
Nine years after proving its professionalism on the battlefield as a victorious army, the SLA, as the country?s biggest reservoir of human resources, is engaged in transforming itself into a peace-time force with a focus on nation building and contributing to world peace, he said. The SLA will also engage in fighting its own case now, with regard to allegations of war crimes. This is one of the tasks mandated to be carried out by the army?s ?Directorate of Overseas Operations? that was opened last month.? ?
Pressed by reporters on what internal measures? had been taken regarding claims of extra-judicial killings and demands for ?accountability,? the service chief pointed out? that those who made the accusations are ?not here.? Presumably referring to Tamil diaspora-based war crimes lobby, he asked ?Why don?t they engage with us?? If those making the charges were ready to talk directly and give specific details of incidents the SLA would be the first to look into them he said. ?It was a war! ? People forget how many we rescued? he said. Nobody talks about the 3,400 soldiers who went missing in action (MIA).The army was not looking at the past only, but supporting ?all endeavours of the government to address the accusations, he stressed. ?We want to clear our name.?? ?
?
"There was no military or political advantage to GoSL in killing civilians or shelling hospitals indiscriminately, indeed the reverse is the case. High civilian casualties would have made an international/Indian push for halting the final phase, more likely"
Asked why reports by foreign military experts supporting the view that Sri Lankan forces? acquitted themselves honourably were not being used by the army to help clear its name, Senanayake revealed that the new army think-tank at DOP would compile all the relevant material and present it in order to educate the public. Now we want to fight our own case he said. ?All these years we were depending on someone else. We thought they would tell our story.?? ?
There? have been reports by at least two British military experts relating to Sri Lankan forces? conduct of the war in its controversial last stages. They are Lt. Col. Anton Gash, war-time Defence Attache at the British High Commission in Colombo whose dispatches to the Foreign and Commonwealth Office in London are now public, and Maj. Gen. (Retd) John Holmes DSO OBE MC a former Commander of UK?s elite Special Air Service (SAS) and? Director of Special Forces, whose Military Expert Opinion forms an Annex to the Paranagama (2nd mandate) Report. Senanayake recalled also the remarks of ?an American officer? in 2011 - referring no doubt to the intervention at a defence seminar by Lt. Col. Lawrence Smith, Defence Attache from the US Embassy. ?They were not our ?friends,? but they were telling the real story? he said.? ?
It?s? ?worth noting that the above-mentioned reports and statements, conveniently ignored by the OHCHR war crimes probe, were made by persons with specialized military expertise, whereas members of the Darusman panel on whose findings the OHCHR heavily leaned on, had no military background, never visited Sri Lanka and largely drew on anonymous testimony to make their claims.? ?
Holmes? report is as detailed and thorough as one can expect from a military officer with special expertise in hostage rescue operations. In his ?Conclusions,? he starts by pointing out that ?There was no military or political advantage to GoSL in killing civilians or shelling hospitals indiscriminately, indeed the reverse is the case. High civilian casualties would have made an international/Indian push for halting the final phase, more likely.?? ?
On civilian deaths he wrote: ?The precise number of civilian deaths and their exact status at their time of death may never be known. The accusations against GoSL imply either a deliberate policy to target civilians or disinterest in the scale of civilian casualties in achieving their strategic objective. All the available evidence discounts any form of deliberate policy or systematically reckless or disproportionate conduct, despite the civilian casualties, to the extent that it is even possible to determine what proportion of those killed were civilians.? He points out that ?It is undeniable, though, that had LTTEnot driven civilians before them and executed them when they attempted to escape, then civilian casualties would have been significantly lower.?? ?
?
"Nine years after proving its professionalism on the battlefield as a victorious army, the SLA, as the country?s biggest reservoir of human resources, is engaged in transforming itself into a peace-time force focusing on nation building and contributing to world peace"
Rubbishing the Darusman report?s peculiar arithmetic he said? A figure of up to 40,000 civilian deaths is much quoted and has been simply arrived at by subtracting the number of IDPs processed (290,000) from the Darusman estimate of the number of civilians caught up in the final months of the war (330,000). The author believes that, in principle, there is every reason to challenge this estimate of the numbers killed ??(he then goes on to explain why). Holmes concluded that ?The figure of 40,000 civilians killed which has been repeatedly published is, in my view, extremely difficult to sustain on the evidence which I have seen.?? ?
On the hostage situation created by the LTTE using civilians as a human shield, he wrote:? ?
?It was, in the view of the author, an entirely unique situation and the fact that 290,000 people escaped alive is in itself remarkable. Indeed, given the allegations of the use of MBRLs and use of heavy weaponry against the civilian population, had the SLA embarked on an indiscriminate campaign of bombardment, the trite but obvious point that any military expert is forced to conclude, is that 2/3 days of shelling would have decimated all those in that final confined area. I reiterate, in my experience of hostage rescue, the fact that so many escaped, is remarkable.?? ?
Holmes? assessment is that it is ?extremely difficult to sustain an accusation of the deliberate killing of civilians by the SLA by shelling, which had the artillery potential over a very short period of time to devastate the temporary civilian encampments, particularly in NFZs 2 and 3.?? ?
He concluded saying:? ?
?In my military opinion, faced with a determined enemy that were deploying the most ruthless of tactics and which involved endangering the Tamil civilian population, SLA had limited options with regard to the battle strategy they could deploy. This would have posed a dilemma for the very best trained and equipped armies in the world.The SLA had either to continue taking casualties and allow the LTTE to continue preying upon its own civilians, or take the battle to the LTTE, albeit with an increase in civilian casualties. The tactical options were stark, but in my military opinion, justifiable and proportionate given the unique situation SLA faced in the last phase. Therefore, on the evidence available to me, taking into account my own combat experience, I do not find, in broad terms that the military and artillery campaigns were conducted indiscriminately, but were proportionate to the military objectives sought.?? ?
