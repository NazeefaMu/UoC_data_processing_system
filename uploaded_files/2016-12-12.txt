Christmas tree back on track
	
The construction of the world?s tallest Christmas tree at the Galle Face Green has been resumed today after it was put on hold two weeks ago, the Ports and Shipping Ministry said.
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe is reported to have asked Minister Arjuna Ranatunga to resume the construction of the Christmas tree.
The Prime Minister and the Finance Minister had met Colombo's Archbishop Malcolm Cardinal Ranjith on Sunday and informed him that this tree was being built from private donations.
Earlier the Cardinal had said the construction of the Christmas tree was a waste of money and that it would have been much better to use the funds to construct houses for the poor or provide scholarships to poor children.
Later, the Prime Mover Driver's Union of the Ports Authority and Social Welfare Committee announced that the construction of the Christmas tree had been stopped.? (Lahiru Pothmulla)

H'tota Port employees have no legal docs to validate employment: Minister
	
Some 90% of the port employees who were protesting at the Hambantota Port had been appointed by the ?Nil Balakaya? youth organisation headed by MP Namal Rajapaksa during the previous regime, Ports and Shipping Minister Arjuna Ranatunga said today.
Addressing a news conference at the Ports and Shipping Ministry, the minister said the employees had never been made permanent during the Rajapaksa government.
?These employees had no legal document issued to validate their employment. I personally visited the employees at the port and briefed them about the actual situation of their employment. Most of the employees were recruited to the Magampura Harbor and the harbour had been established as the Magampura Port Management Company (MPMC)," he said.
?After the government came into power, we have given permanent appointments to 88 employees who were on contract basis. Their employment probation period had been completed by November 11 this year. Now those employees were appointed as permanent employees under the MPMC,? the minister said.
?These people are today requesting permanent appointment to the Ports Authority. There was no such promise made by this government or the previous government to appoint MPMC employees to the Ports Authority. According to my knowledge there are political forces operating behind them and that force is from the previous regime and they don?t like to give them a permanent job,? he said.
The new institute the ministry plans to set up in collaboration with the Chinese company and the Ports Authority will provide permanent employment opportunities and it?s a government institute, the Minister said.
"The people from the previous regime are trying to destabilize the employment status in the ports Authority. We cannot take any responsibility over their employment because they had caused a huge damage to government property during the protest," he said.
?If I make a new company tomorrow, I will not take any of these employees because they are still influenced by the political forces and they cannot be trusted,? minister Ranatunga said. (Chatruanga Pradeep)

The ?MV Hoyanger?, which was the other vessel to be taken control of by the Navy after the Hambantota Port employees seized it last week, is still berthed at the pier under naval security, Navy spokesman Akram Alavi said today.
He said the ship was yet to unload its cargo before proceeding to the next port of call.
The vessel 'Hyperion Highway' sailed to Oman after leaving the harbour under a navy escort.
Meanwhile, the sathyagraha staged by the Magampura Port Workers Committee continued to its fifth day over demands that all 483 workers be absorbed into the permanent cadre of the Ports Authority.
Magampura Port Workers Committee Secretary Gayan Sandaruwan said none of the senior officials of the Ports Authority had intervened to solve this matter. (Darshana Sanjeewa and Kalathma Jayawardhane)

The roof of the under construction building came crashing down on worshippers on Saturday as they were attending the ordination of a bishop.
Akan Weeks, the founder of the Reigners Bible Church International who was to be ordained as bishop at the ceremony, escaped unhurt. Akwa Ibom state Governor Udom Emmanuel, another worshipper present in the church when the roof collapsed, also escaped without being injured.

Tamil NGOs in Malaysia oppose SL President's visit
	
Several political parties and Indian non-governmental organisations in Malaysia have threatened to hold demonstrations if the Government allowed Sri Lankan President Maithripala Sirisena to make a visit to the country.
He is scheduled to visit Malaysia on December 15 to sign several memorandum of understanding (MoUs) with the Government and also to launch the Sri Lanka Food and Cultural Festival.
Johor PKR Vice-Chairman Rony Murugan expressed his dismay over Mr. Sirisena's scheduled visit here, adding that the Government should take into consideration the sentiments of the Tamilians in the country.
He said Mr. Sirisena should not be allowed into the country because of his alleged role in the killing of civilians during the Sri Lankan Civil War.
Rony, who is also the coordinator for the Johor Coalition Against the Visit of the President of Sri Lanka, said the coalition would be lodging police reports in 10 stations throughout the state, as a sign of protest.
The coalition, which was formed to protest against the visit, consists of 10 non-governmental organisations including the Johor Tamilar Sangam and Hindu Rights Action Force (Hindraf) as well as PKR, DAP, Amanah and Parti Sosialis Malaysia (PSM).
Tebrau PKR chief Mohammad Annuar Abdullah added that the coalition was not protesting against diplomatic relations with Sri Lanka.
"We are not protesting against the diplomatic relations between Sri Lanka and Malaysia, but there are many more respectable figures from Sri Lanka that we can welcome to the country," he said.
A meanwhile, in Kuala Lumpur, a number of Malaysian Tamil NGOs are also set to protest against Mr. Sirisena's visit.
The group said in a short press statement that it would stage a protest outside the Sri Lanka High Commission on Sunday over the president's visit. (The Star)

TN leaders knew Prabhakaran would kill them to rule Eelam: Menon
	
Leaders of Tamil Nadu, across the political divide, privately but effectively supported the Indian government?s policy of opposing efforts by the US and Norway to rescue Velupillai Prabhakaran so that his Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) lived to fight another day, says Shivshankar Menon, India?s former National Security Adviser (NSA) in his book; ?Choices: Inside the Making of India?s? Foreign Policy?.
?Political leaders across the political divide in Tamil Nadu knew that the only way Prabhakaran could lead Tamil Eelam would be to physically eliminate the real leaders of the Tamils who were in India, just as he had already done to other Tamil leaders in Sri Lanka,? Menon says in the chapter entitled ?Force Works.?
?Despite differences in public posture on the issue in Tamil Nadu and Delhi, there was cross party private understanding on the basics of the policy toward Sri Lanka with both the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) party and the All India Anna Dravida Kazhagam Party (AIADMK) party, as a result of considerable hard work by Pranab Mukherjee (the then Foreign Minister) and Narayanan (the then NSA), as I found when I met alone with very senior Tamil Nadu politicians in Chennai, away from the glare of publicity,? Menon recalls.
?Ironically, by murdering Rajiv Gandhi, the LTTE had caused a shift in broader Indian attitudes, which came to be more in line with those of the Sri Lankan government,? he says.
According to Menon, India?s policy options were limited. New Delhi was aware that a victorious Sri Lankan President Mahinda Rajapaksa would be less dependent on India and therefore less responsive. Rajapaksa not only had a firm grip on the levers of power, including the military, but also the backing of China, Pakistan ?and to an extent, the United States.?
As regards the US he makes the interesting observation that ?the United States was willing to help him (Rajapaksa) in practice with intelligence and military training, but was constrained to express human rights concerns, without letting them to rise to the level of affecting his conduct of the war against terrorism.?
On the issues before India, Menon says: ?If India had stood aside and asked him (Rajapaksa) to desist, in effect, defending the killers of an Indian Prime Minister, we would have effectively written ourselves out of Sri Lanka for the next decade or more, sacrificing our maritime and other interests in Sri Lanka and abdicating a geopolitically strategic neighbor to other powers. We could hardly abandon Sri Lanka to potentially hostile influences. In effect, Sri Lanka is an aircraft carrier parked fourteen miles off the Indian coast.?
Knowing that victory was round the corner, Rajapaksa was in no mood to agree to Western ceasefire proposals or to any idea that the LTTE leadership might be evacuated to safety, even if that was the only certain way to prevent casualties among civilians that the? LTTE had driven onto to the peninsula as their hostages and human shields, Menon notes.
But Rajapaksa?s obduracy was matched by Prabkaran?s whose thoughts and plans were increasingly remote from reality. He had either sidelined or killed people who could have advised him better. Prabhakaran?s obduracy resulted in the complete elimination of the LTTE?s military machine and its leadership, including himself and his family.
The way the Sri Lankans fought the war, though criticized for its brutality in the final stages, might have taken a higher toll if delay and stalemate were brought about, Menon feels in his assessment of the war.
?It is arguable that some brutality was inevitable in a war of this kind against a violent terrorist group that had shown no qualms about terrorizing its own people and physically eliminating all its potential adversaries, Tamil or Sinhala.?
?Indeed, one must logically ask the question, would an earlier adoption of the more brutal methods of the last thirty months of the war have brought it to an earlier end and actually saved lives and minimized the war?s deleterious effects?. This is a recurrent problem in state craft. It is also the strongest justification for the use of atomic weapons to end World War II.?
?The strategist Edward Luttwak argues that there are situations in which one should give war a chance. Was Sri Lanka one of them, where peace building efforts and international mediation only prolonged and worsened the agony?,? Menon asks and concludes by saying: ? These are difficult counterfactuals that go against the grain of liberal thinking, but they do seem appropriate to the Sri Lankan case.? (New Indian Express)

UNP?s policy is selling public assets: Namal
	
MP Namal Rajapaksa yesterday claimed that selling public assets regardless of its consequence was a cornerstone of UNP?s policy and added that they had never built the Hambantota harbour and the Mattala airport to be privatized.
Issuing a statement, Mr. Rajapaska said the SLFP members of the government who claimed to be following Bandaranaike polices were not doing anything while state assets are being sold off.
?The SLFP ministers claimed that they are anti-UNP and trying to prove this by publicly criticising the UNP. But this is only an attempt to deceive the SLFP voters. While pretending to be opposed to the UNP, the SLFP ministers voted for the VAT Bill, the Office of Missing Persons Bill, and the UNP favoured budget,? he said.
Meanwhile, commenting on the assault on the journalist at the Hambantota harbour, he said the whole country had witnessed the manner in which a party, led by the Navy Commander dispersed harbour workers who were demanding job security and opposing privatisation of the Hambantota port.
?The protestors were unarmed and did not attack the naval personnel with sticks or stones or hurled petrol bombs. Yet warning shots were fired, and protestors were attacked with rifle butts. The Navy Commander himself was seen threatening protestors and physically attacking and abusing a journalist using obscene language,? he said.
He said the UPFA General Secretary and the UNP Deputy Leader; both Cabinet ministers representing the Hambantota district did not defend the workers.
