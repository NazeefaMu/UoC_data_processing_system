A trumpet call; save the elephant
	
The elephant is one of Sri Lanka?s most majestic creatures and acclaimed as the king of our jungles. It is unfortunate that we are still embroiled in what is called a human-elephant conflict, which was created after we robbed the elephants of their lands and called them rogues when hungry animals came searching for food. Last Sunday was ?World Elephant Day? and the organizers say that in keeping with tradition, we need to devote some time and attention to what has happened to the elephants over the past year.? ?
World Elephant Day Communications Directress Anne Dillon and Executive Director Patricia Sims say there is, as always, good news and bad, but they are hopeful that the tide overall is beginning to turn in the elephants? favour. As so much is going on, they say that what they are communicating is not so comprehensive but it is instead an update of some of the issues the world?s elephants now face. The major problem is the human-elephant conflict -- the struggle over land and resources.? ?
In November last year, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service announced that the Donald Trump administration was lifting former President Barack Obama?s ban on importing legally hunted elephant trophies from Zimbabwe and Zambia. A public outcry ensued and Mr. Trump then inserted himself into the equation by putting the reversal on hold for further review. At the same time, environmental groups filed a lawsuit challenging the reversal, in part because it violated the Endangered Species Act. In March this year, the US announced it would allow trophy imports on a case-by-case basis. This too was challenged in court. Additional legal action ensued on August 1 when conservationists and animal rights activists brought a suite against the recently formed International Wildlife Conservation Council (IWCC).? ?
On another front, Botswana, the country with the largest number of African elephants on the continent, is contemplating lifting its elephant hunting ban. Botswana argues that it has too many elephants, with escalating human-elephant conflict as a result. One manifestation of this is the case of elephants raiding farmers? crops. Apparently to Botswana?s way of thinking if the hunting ban is lifted some of these troublesome elephants will no longer be a problem. However, in this they make a fundamental miscalculation given that typically large bulls are targeted in a trophy hunt, which takes place during the dry season. Crop raiding, on the other hand, usually involves young bulls or herds of families foraging for food during the rainy season, World Elephant Day organizers say.? ?
According to them, Zimbabwe also has problems when it comes to elephants -- the continuing capture and export of them to Asia. In October last year, wildlife journalists Christina Russo and Adam Cruise wrote a groundbreaking story in The Guardian on the subject. In it they reported that earlier in August, fourteen young elephants had been captured for sale to a Chinese national with a track record of animal neglect. These elephants were ultimately destined for Chinese zoos.? ?
Earlier, as documented in a National Geographic article, seventeen elephants were exported from Swaziland to three zoos in the US -- the Dallas Zoo; the Sedgwick County Zoo in Wichita, Kansas; and the Henry Doorly Zoo in Omaha, Nebraska. Elephants captured for a life in captivity have been known to be as young as two years old. Problematically, at this tender age they remain reliant on their mother?s milk for survival.? ?
In Sri Lanka it is reported that the total wild elephant range is between 2,100 and 3000 while the captive population is between 200 and 250. Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka who led the troops to victory in 2009 and is now the Minister of Wildlife Conservation faces the challenge of finding a solution to the human-elephant conflict and maintaining the number of the majestic kings of Sri Lankan jungles. It is a trumpet call to all our people also to come forward and take steps to save our elephants because the number is declining to a dangerous level.????

ACPBWA to strike tonight against new traffic spot fines
	
The All Ceylon Private Bus Workers Association (ACPBWA) said it would launch a strike from midnight against new fines imposed for violating road rules.
Speaking to media, ACPBWA Convener U.K Kumararathna Renuka said the sudden increase of new traffic fines was not reasonable.
?Our daily salary is Rs.1,500 and the spot fine is Rs.3,000. If we are fined exorbitant charges, we will not be able to look after our families,? he said.
The association urged the government not to implement the spot fines until the relevant technical equipment was fixed to the road network, Mr. Renuka said.
The private drivers of bowser, container and three-wheeler drivers of Colombo will join the protest, he said.
All Ceylon Private Bus Workers Association went on strike in the Southern province in December 2016 against the 2017 budget proposal to increase the minimum traffic fine to Rs 2500.
Meanwhile, Lanka Private Bus Owners' Association (LPBOA) President Gemunu Wijeratne requested the ACPBWA not to hold the strike action because of ongoing G.C.E. A/L examination.
He said the LPBOA cannot participate in the scheduled bus strike while disrupting the children's examination.
Therefore, Mr. Wijeratne requested the ACPBWA not to hold the strike action until the end of the examination. If they launched the strike after the examination, the LPBOA would also join them. (Chaturanga Samarawickrama)

Ban on non-standard plugs: Govt. plans to minimize electricity accidents
	
Electricity is a vital aspect in human life. It has now become part and parcel of our day-to-day lives and one cannot think of a world without electricity. Almost all the devices at homes, businesses and industries are operating because of electricity. As electricity is very useful to our lives, we have to be cautious of the accidents caused when using electricity.? ?
There are over 60 types of different plugs used with electrical equipment in Sri Lanka. The three most common socket types used in Sri Lanka are 15A- Round Socket, 5A round Socket and 13A square socket.? ?
?
The standard was finalised through a wide public consultation process conducted over a period of one year
?
In plugging these different plug-tops to socket outlets that don?t match, people are exposed to unsafe practices like the following:? ?
?
Non quality multi sockets (multi plugs)? ?
	Non quality extensions? ?
	Permanently blocking earth hole to keep gates open? ?
	Inserting necked wires in to sockets? ?
?
Due to these unsafe practices, the people are exposed to more electric related accidents and also see their properties being damaged due to fires. Concerns were raised on the grounds that Sri Lanka should make citizens use accepted methods when using plugs and sockets.? ?
?
PUCSL standardises plugs and sockets
The Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL) introduced a new national standard in 2016 for plugs and sockets.? ?
This single standard, proposed by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe in his capacity as the Minister of National Policies and Economic Affairs, received Cabinet approval on 16 August in 2016.? ?
The Commission decided that the Type G-plug and socket outlet, widely known as the 13 Ampere plug and socket outlet, commonly referred to as the ?Square Pin? plug and socket, should be viewed as a product which which meets the national standard.? ?
The standard was finalised through a wide public consultation process conducted over a period of one year, during which the general public, industrialists, manufacturers, appliance retailers, energy sector experts, state regulatory and standards institutions and other stakeholders significantly contributed to the decision making.? ?
Accordingly, the importing and manufacturing of non-standard items were banned from 16th August 2017 and the selling of non-standard items was to be banned from 16th August 2018. However, the PUCSL extended the ban on selling non-standard items until December 31, this year.? ?
PUCSL Assistant Director S. Krishananth told the Daily Mirror that it had to extend the ban on selling due to the concerns raised by the local entrepreneurs dealing with plugs and sockets.? ?
?The decision to impose a standardisation on plugs and sockets was taken with the aim of uplifting the safety of electricity consumers. The standard will apply to the electrical appliances as well.? Krishananth said.? ?
He added that the new set of standards issued under SLS 734, specifies requirements for 13A fused plugs having insulating sleeves on line and neutral pins and 13A shuttered socket-outlets for household, commercial and light industrial purposes, with particular reference to safety during normal use. ?
?
The importing and manufacturing of non-standard items were banned from 16th August 2017 and the selling of non-standard items was to be banned from 16th August 2018
?
Ban to be fully effective
According to the new standards, only the equipment with type G (13 A square) plug-tops and sockets are permitted for import, produce and for sale.? ?
Plugging equipment with 5A plug to a 13A square plug or wise versa as multi plugs are banned.? ?
With the new standard, 13A-5A and 5A-13A one to one converters are produced and released to the market.? ?
The wiring of new installations, the addition of circuits to existing installations or complete re-wiring of existing installation, should be carried out with 2.5 mm 2 (7/0.67 mm Cu) and must be compatible with type G-13A socket outlets.? ?
The Department of Import and Export Control recently gazetted regulations with regard to importing standardised plugs and socket outlets to Sri Lanka as a measure of implementing the single standard for plugs and socket outlets in Sri Lanka.? ?
PUCSL has decided to create an enabling environment, issue the necessary regulations and facilitate the participation of other regulatory agencies to ensure that Sri Lanka systematically moves to using one type of plugs and socket outlets.? ?
Although the importation and manufacturing were banned earlier, the ban will be fully effective from?January 1, 2019. The ban is effective on sales as well.? ?
?
?
?
The decision to impose a standardisation on plugs and sockets was taken with the aim of uplifting the safety of electricity consumers 
- PUCSL Assistant?Director S. Krishananth
?
?
?
What happens to existing sockets and plug-tops at home?
PUCSAL Assistant Director said that there was no need for people to replace the existing 5A or 15 A round pin sockets and added if one day it happened to be replaced by an existing 5A socket, they should buy a square socket.? ?
The transition to the type G-standard plug and socket should not require any premises to be re-wired purely for the purpose of accommodating the new standard, and that the existing wiring may remain until the end of its lifespan,? Krishananth added.?
?
Electricity users adopt a variety of methods and devices, most of which are unsafe and cause the connection to be unreliable ?
?
Electrocutions in Sri Lanka
Electricity users adopt a variety of methods and devices, most of which are unsafe and cause the connection to be unreliable.? ?
There have been as many as 95 electrocutions in 2015, up from 76 in 2013 and 73 in 2014. The use of substandard plugs, sockets, electrical accessories, adaptors and extension cords are some of the main causes of electrocutions and fires.? ?
In conclusion, it is noteworthy that the PUCSAL has taken the initiative to ban the non-standard plugs and sockets considering the fact that the general public are vulnerable to electricity related accidents due to the lack of concerns over electrical materials.??

Celebrated war hero  now sells fish
	
The untold suffering and dedication of the war heroes, who were engaged in a thirty-year-armed-conflict, are indescribable. They were once treated as the saviours of this nation. However, this is the tragic story of a war hero, who waged war on behalf of territorial integrity and peace.
Parts of fish, ?Theppili? get cut systematically with the knife that moves with the instant batting of an eye-lid. First its the fins, later gills, scales, intestines and veins are removed before the tail is cut. These tasks take less than one minute for Sagara, who squats on the ground to cut and clean the fish. He says that it is simple for him to cut even ten thousand kgs. of Theppili per day, in this manner.? ?
There are about ten or fifteen customers forming a queue, opposite K.B.Ratnayake Vidyalaya, awaiting their turn to buy fish from Sagara. All pieces of fish cut by him are put into a plastic basin. Priyanka is the one who puts the required amount of fish to a shopping bag. She is Sagara?s partner in life.? ?
?
When the popularity of Sagara began to rise after the war victory, he had to face certain issues
?
She peeps into the nearby Tri-Shaw to check on her three-year-old child, who is asleep. There is a specialty about Sagara for us to pen this story.? ?
We received the information that a war hero was selling fish. We came to know that Sagara, who was known as ?Galewela long Sagara? while serving in the Commando Unit of the Army, was selling fish to make a living. We knew that ?Malu Sagara?, who is selling fish at the Matale junction, now is the same person who was once known as ? Galewela long Sagara?. We then went in search of his house in Kurundankulama. During an interview, Sagara put the wealth of experience in his possession to good use in recalling a heroic past.? ?
Amurtha Hastha Navaratna Abeykone Mudiyanselage Sagara Nuwan Bandara is a native of Watagala in Galewela. He became popular among his colleagues in the army as ?Initial Bandara? because he had several initials before his name. He was also known as ?Long Bandara? alias? Galewela Sagara? due his extraordinary height and ability. He was known by several pseudonyms in the Army and at present he is known by many names like ?Malu Sagara? and ?Malu Koma? while at the Matale junction he is known as ?Koma?.? ?
?
Once a rebel youth
Sagara was educated at Budugehinna Maha Vidyalaya in Galewela up to grade ten. He was known to be an unruly person. He may have decided to join the Commando Force for that reason itself. He joined the 22nd Regular Force of the Sri Lanka Army (Gemunu Watch) on December 25, 2004. He received his basic training from Boossa Regiment school.? ?
Later, he was trained as a commando at the Kudaoya Commando Training School and passed out in 2006. Although as many as 800 soldiers received training, only 138 passed out.This is because such a serious training is required to become a commando in the Army.? ?
Sagara was known to be a very clever solider and was nicknamed by his colleagues as ?Initial Bandara?, due to his lengthy name.? ?
?
In the war front
The first experience of Long Bandara was the ?Thoppigala? operation. He recalled suffering a slight wound during that operation. Sagara belonged to a group of eight who was led by Sergent Pathirana. They waited in ambush in a village where ordinary Tamil people lived. Their group was forced to scatter all over the place and they also experienced a break in communication during one occasion. Seven soldiers returned, except Sergeant Pathirana. The beating of a drum was heard all over the village, but the soldiers, who were unaware of it, began to sleep.? ?
Meanwhile, the soldier, who was on sentry duty, heard the noise of wires being cut. When the whole camp awoke, after receiving his information, they realised that the enemies had surrounded the camp. The first attack that Sagara faced was indescribable. The soldiers, who were asleep, awoke and began attacking the enemies. Sagara suffered a slight injury.? ?
According to Sagara their first experience in taking on the enemy was a success.? ?
?
Sagara engaged in the fishing trade
?
A road in name of the Sergeant
?It transpired later that the LTTE had captured Sergeant Pathirana and obtained all the information regarding the Commando Soldiers by torturing him. Sergeant Pathirana had been dragged by his hands and legs using tractors. The beating of the drum was a warning to ordinary Tamil people to leave the villages in the event of a forthcoming attack.? ?
Sagara was shocked by this tragedy and he lived in agony. However, he had written his colleague?s name in red using lacquer on a wooden plank. He hung the plank prominently on the wooden wall of a nearby bookshop. The wooden wall gave the directions to Thoppigala.? ?
?
Terrible operation
After Operation Liberation of Thoppigala, Sagara was engaged in operations in the Mannar area. Sagara recalled how the operation in Mannar was successful under the leadership of Sergeant Kumarasinghe. Sergeant Kumarasinghe was known as ? Hichcha?.? ?
As mentioned earlier a team is formed with a group of eight men. A troop is formed with three such groups. Irrespective of seniority, these groups were engaged in war to achieve big targets. There was healthy competition between these Commando groups. About 100 commandos were engaged in operations; the operation known as ?Rice bowl?.? ?
?
Celebrating with tattoos
?The commanding officer had asked what they wanted because the eight-man group, including Sagara, had attacked big targets by travelling about 30 ? 40 km in the thick jungles. Sagara requested permission to celebrate the occasion with tattoos. The permission for tattoos was given. During the war such permission for tattoos was not given to army soldiers. Army Commander Sarath Fonseka came and boosted our morale. The high officers also encouraged us. We got maximum benefits and a deserving rest after the operation,? he said.? ?
?
His photo was used in the ticket books of 60th Centenary Celebration of the Army
?
Disguised as Tiger rebels
?When the enemies infiltrated our forward defense line, we were deployed to repair the fences and clear them. Then we had to go forward about 20 to 25 metres.? ?
?We were being checked at the enemy points. When we go for operations we carry food and water which was sufficient for 2?3 days. We go for an operation dressed in a uniform similar to those worn by the LTTE and fitting sandal soles to the boots. Then the eight of us spread out. We have protected others and achieved our targets. A journalist once asked, ?While you are in an operation, don?t the soldiers attack? My reply was, why not? When we go off the lines, we inform our units about the directions and the places where we wish to go. We remove these rebel uniforms when we return to the camps. There were occasions when we were sandwiched between the LTTE and the soldiers? he said.? ?
?
An eight-hour recce in a toilet pit
?When I set foot in Wellimulliwaikkal first, I did not know the area. I was the one who went first from our group. We reached this area towards nightfall. The houses were like shanties. Although we tried to proceed without being noticed by the people, I fell into a pit. It was a toilet pit dug by the people temporarily. I remained in the pit with the weapons for eight hours until dawn. My duty was to obtain the information by going forward.? ?
?It was after our recce that the civilians in their hundreds and thousands surrendered to the army. All our high-ups knew about that operation. I managed to came back after the operation which made me filthy?,? recalled Sagara.? ?
He remembers with pride not sustaining any injury after that incident. He said that a firm foundation was laid for him to lead his life meaningfully due to these experiences. He said with a touch of pride that it wasn?t a difficult task to cut fish to earn a living.? ?
?
Publicity through photos
?It is using these types of stories that artistes and film directors portray the heroics of security forces. The result of these efforts is either a great film or a tele-drama. Despite the little attention given to the war by film makers newspaper journalists did not forget our heroic soldiers. With the televisions giving air time and newspapers decorating their pages with the news about the heroics of soldiers, it did not take so long for Sagara to become a prominent personality. Banners and cut-outs began to mushroom all over the country containing his photographs. ?
Sagara?s friends saw his photos being displayed all over the country. The photographs that prominently show that war was won features Sagara.
When Sagara?s photograph became famous and highlighted in the media, local and foreign journalists began to focus their attention on this handsome youth. At a time, when the leaders in the war front were given prominence, stories were written about this unique character too. His photograph was published in the front page of the magazines as well. His photo was used in the ticket books of 60th Centenary Celebration of the Army and also in the posters of the Commando Force.?
?
Leaving the Army
When the popularity of Sagara began to rise after the war victory, he had to face certain issues that compelled him to leave the Army. The photographs, that were published in a foreign magazine, were taken with the advice of the high officers of the Army. However, when those photos began to become continuously popular, he was ignored by the Army. He was transferred to the Head Quarters. He was sent for shows. He did not take leave for six months. A high officer of the army was a friend of his. Some media men invited him for meals. They started associating with his family members and their problems aggravated. They decided to send him home as a result. In the meantime, the problems within the Army began to escalate and he was compelled to desert his place of employment.? ?
It is an accepted fact that the soldiers engaged in action have to face unimaginable experiences. Such soldiers may not be suitable for office work as well. Sometimes, Sagara may have been in such a position. He had evaded the Army, but his unruly behaviour was not on the wane. He was involved in an incident with the Galewela Police. It was a civil incident. As a result, he was arrested by the Army and was forced to spent six months in the ?cell?. He had spent some time in ? Gal palliya? and some media men had attempted to get him released from this place. However, he was released due to the efforts of high-ranked officers. But he lost his rank as a result of being punished. Arrangements had been made to rehabilitate him, but he was fed up with Army, a place which he had not served even for eight years.? ?
After leaving the Army he went in search of jobs, armed with his photographs. Being a married man, he did not feel the burden because his wife, Priyanka, worked in the Army Hospital in Anuradhapura. He had met her when he was admitted to the hospital with severe injuries. Priyanka could not identify him as a soldier because he had his hair dyed and wore tattoos. At that time he was in civvies. He had explained to the journalist how she became his wife despite her protests. With the passage of time, he started selling fish with the little money he had in order to survive. Today he is a wholesale fish trader. He is engaged in the sale of fish from the river. He sells them wholesale to shops, markets and hawkers. He cuts the fish using a box of ice, pair of scales and a knife by the side of the road. Priyanka, who stopped working four years ago, assists him.? ?
He engages in his trade mostly on Sundays and is seen near K.B.Ratnayake Vidyalaya. He spoke in agony because he had to face difficulties due to some Government officers.? ?
He said, ?I remember the service we rendered on behalf of the war. We went on for months giving our commitment. We were good as long as the war raged. After the war, we are ignored as coconut refuse,? he complains.
It?s no surprise that these types of thoughts occupy his mind. A gigantic banner, covered with dust, is displayed at his home. I requested him to keep it clean. His quick reply was filled with uncontrollable emotions.? ?
?For what purpose should I keep it clean? How many places did I go in search of jobs? I was not offered a job even considering my service. Now we live with the grace of the Gods, by selling fish. We get some money when fish is available. On the other days we live by selling the furniture in our house,? says Sagara. His thoughts are diverse. This man, who speaks with pride when recalling the times with his Army colleagues, also speaks with great frustration. He spoke about the injustice caused to him and his friends after the war. But, the truth about all this is not known. But one thing is certain. Nine years have passed after the rebels were crushed in the war. It seems that the practice of appreciating the services of war heroes has gone with the wind. It is a mistake committed by us with regard to heroes like Sagara. It pricks our conscience when we think about the peace that we enjoy today.

Changing base for the coming race!
	
?
A front-line Green party leader currently active in the deep South has planned to shift his political base to the city, a sizable part of which has been a family domain for several decades.??
?
This young politico known to be a leading aspirant to both party leadership and the country?s Number One position has reportedly decided that it would be more convenient for him to make subtle political moves and sharp maneuverings in the pursuit of his goal from the city base rather than from the distant South, they say.?
Some people say that this party heavyweight had been marking time instead of actively pursuing his goal due to the advice of astrologers that he bides his time until the arising of the most powerful Rajayoga.?
Diplomats of certain powerful countries based in the city too have reportedly assured him of their support for his pursuit for the twin goals, they say.??

Every aspect of Elegant 16 being handled by best-in-class experts
	
Reserving an apartment in an under-construction building generally requires careful evaluation. But in the case of the boutique apartment Elegant 16, being developed by Ekroma, the impeccable credentials of the partners in the project reflects the stability, strength and rigidity of the impressive edifice and why it makes for a wise investment. Engaged in commercial property leasing, condominium development and strategic investments, Ekroma is a BOI-approved real estate and development company. It is led by a young and dynamic team committed to maximize the value of their clients? investments by ushering in global real estate trends.?
Every stage of Elegant 16?s construction is being supervised by experts. The piling work for Elegant 16 was entrusted to D.P Jayasinghe Piling, a well-reputed and leading construction service company in Sri Lanka, hailed as one of the most respected project management companies in the region. D.P Jayasinghe provides the best solutions for piling and ground preparation by controlled rock blasting to make the process of the construction a success. This is a critical stage of the construction and D. P. Jayasingha is best equipped to handle this. Demonstrating its commitment for maintaining the highest standards, Elegant 16 has done piling for just 5 floors to strengthen the structure, proving that safety of residents is high priority, even though piling is usually done for buildings that are higher than 10 floors.
?
The stability of the structure has been ensured by thorough structural design incorporating pile foundation up to bedrock and rigid beam, column frames to transmit various possible loading to the ground safely. Grade 30 concrete with high yield steel reinforcement in each element will ensure the structural system withstands the load subjected. Strict quality control was maintained during construction by careful supervision by the consultants.
Elegant 16 is poised to unveil the boutique living concept to Sri Lanka upon completion by end August 2018. Boutique apartments are a new trend in the real estate market globally. Consisting of two and three-bedroom uniquely curated living spaces, this new-age concept apartment ushers in an exclusive lifestyle concept in Sri Lanka. Our lead consultant Design Advocacy played a key role in coming up with the new ?boutique? concept.?
Elegant 16 has a floor configuration of 3-4 units per floor. As per a real estate report by KPMG, apartment projects with 2-4 units per floor are considered luxury projects. Furthermore, although the land value on which Elegant 16 is situated is Rs. 9 million per perch, Ekroma is charging a mere Rs. 35 million for a cozy 2-bedroom apartment and Rs. 46 million for a spacious 3 bedroom apartment. With Elegant 16, Ekroma strives to provide only the best quality at an affordable price offering a great ?value-for - money? proposition.?
Elegant 16 is an ideal choice for individuals who wish to buy and lease their dream apartment, as there is a shortage of spaces available for lease in the area. Since the project extends the option to purchase apartments outright or even lease them, Elegant 16 is a fitting choice for savvy investors.

Factory being run from Ministry premises?
	
?
A footwear factory that had been running at a loss in the past has turned into a money-spinning venture under a new ownership, they say.?
?
The new owner is said to be a yahapalanaya heavyweight from the upcountry. The real news is that he has quietly provided space for the office of his factory management personnel on a floor of his high-rise Ministry building, they say.
If the politico expected the existence of the factory management office inside his Ministry building to be a top secret, he was to be in for a severe disappointment, because his henchmen had been telling all and sundry all about their master owning the factory and running it from Ministry premises it itself.?
However, the politico owning a factory is not something important for most people and what really intrigues them is how he had suddenly come into a big fortune as to buy such a big venture, they say.?
?Meanwhile, a vociferous JO member is said to be planning to raise this factory matter in the council with all supportive documents.

GMOA Doctors at it again, while the poor suffer in pain
	
The GMOA is at it again, making thousands of the poor and under privileged , who are unable to afford private medical care suffer. The GMOA demands are ridiculous , when one thinks of other categories in Government service. Having enjoyed the benefits of a free education and taken the Hippocratic oath which they have conveniently forgotten, they dance to tunes set by defeated politicians who find it difficult to cope with life devoid of the perks, privileges and grandeur they basked in, while in power. The GMOA now dare to call other respected doctors who think of the nation and the poor, traitors and stooges. Everyone with an IQ over zero knows who the stooges are and of whom!! It?s high time that civil society plays their part in protests against doctors and other strikers. Respected doctors of yesteryear, must be revolting in their graves at the behaviour of these so called doctors who don?t even deserve to be called doctors.??
The former President who conveniently forgets his past , perhaps he suffers from selective amnesia says the government shouldn?t interfere in the work of commissions and corporations. We all know about interference even with the judiciary which is now completely independent and was one of the main causes of bad governance. Others incapable of disciplining their own children and keeping them from breaking the law,even causing the death of an innocent boy, are shouting against the UNP leadership. Everything begins at home, they should begin with their own children before pointing fingers at others.? ?
Among achievements of this government are the handing over of over 180 development projects to the public in Polonnaruwa at a cost of Rs 6000 million , not a single one was named after The President or the Prime Minister. A tourist-friendly Tuk-Tuk service was launched by the Prime Minister with over 750 Tuk-Tuk drivers trained across the country. 150 of them received ID?s and certificates.The Central Bank Governor has announced that Sri Lanka?s foreign reserves will rise to about USD 9 Billion by the end of this year, an amount that could cover the country?s import bill for 5 months.The much anticipated Colombo Light Rail Transit project is all set to proceed.Construction is scheduled to commence in 2020 at a cost of USD 1.7 billion which is funded by Japanese government loans, repayable over 40 years at 0.1% interest,with a 12 year initial grace period.
?
There should be quicker response to correct wrong information like the recent one about MP?s salaries being increased
?
The Ministry of Housing and Construction has constructed 101 model villages under the Uda Gammana programme. The 101st model village in Mullaitivu with 30 houses was handed over recently. A 20 acre multimodel transport hub will be set up in Pettah by the Ministry of Megapolis and Western Development. This transport hub will include trains, buses,monorails and an elevated highway. Land has been returned to its rightful owners in the North.
?
The prices of medicines have been reduced, salaries increased and insurance given for schoolchildren. Last week, a community centre was opened by the Prime Minister in Modera, a joint project financed by the Ministry of Finance and the Colombo Municipality, it comprises of four floors, a day care centre for differently abled children, a day care centre for Elders, space where children can do their homework in peace and quiet, a gym and a roof garden. This is a real boon for people in this area and the Municipality plans to open 25 such centres soon. These facilities were non existent all these years. The Tourist Board in a joint project with the Municipality holds regular workshops for training in the hospitality sector, with training and a promise of employment for successful candidates.?
This government hasn?t exactly been asleep or aloof to the woes of the people, as some critics which surprisingly include some UNP MP?s who jumped over only just before the Presidential election, who find fault and are only interested in furthering their own personal ambitions continue to do.. But of course there is much more to be done. Firstly, the corrupt of the past regime and even those in this must be punished. Look at Britain where the standards are still higher in many respects than elsewhere. Ian Paisley was given the boot but over here the corrupt continue to stay put,singing a theme song of ?I don?t know, I can remember.? The pace of action is far too slow here in this respect and some others too. While many UNPers who worked hard to gain victory, have not been helped there are allegations about some holding two posts as Chairmen.
?
This is unfair and should be remedied as soon as possible. There should be more discipline. Ministers and MP?s should be told that they cannot criticise the government, party or leadership in public. If they do so, they should resign. There must be control of their trips abroad. There should be quicker response to correct wrong information like the recent one about MP?s salaries being increased which was untrue and furthermore was a proposal made and passed during the tenure of the past regime.Fast action is required in all spheres mentioned otherwise we will only return to the days of white vans,wild extravagance,corruption , dictatorship and the waste of public funds to enhance personal glory. There should be monitoring of MP?s visiting their electorates. There are many who spend their time partying in Colombo or on trips abroad and then have the audacity to blame the Leader when they lose elections..? ?
MP?s and Ministers should follow the example of the Prime Minister in his dedication and commitment to hard work and refraining from slandering those who slander him. That is a mark of greatness which few other politicians in this country possess. There are among them some with outsize ego?s who enjoy being used by the electronic circus of TV. Dynasties have no part in politics today. The new generation doesn?t know or wish to know about the great statesman of the past. Riding piggy back on these names will reap no dividends politically. While reading interviews and statements by some politicians, I am reminded of a Churchillian saying on verbosity. ? Its sheer laziness not compressing thought into a reasonable space.?????

HALO expects to free Jaffna from mines by late 2019
	
HALO Trust, the largest international mine action operator in Sri Lanka, said it?s current chief goal is to complete mine clearance of Jaffna by the end of 2019.
It said only 24 sq.km. of minefields are remaining in Sri Lanka.
Head of Media of HALO Trust, Louise Vaughan told the Daily Mirror that the target set by the Sri Lankan Government to make the country mine-impact free by 2020, could be achieved.
?However, mine clearance organisations need US$14 million in addition to existing funding to achieve this,? she said.
According to the HALO Trust?s website, its staff numbers in Sri Lanka have dropped by over 60% since 2014. ?However, we have the equipment and experience to rebuild our demining capacity to over 1,000 national staff,? it said.
Meanwhile, Army Spokesman Brigadier Sumith Atapattu said 94 per cent of minefields have been cleared according to the latest data and the remaining four per cent were mostly hazardous areas.
?From the 94 per cent of the landmine cleared areas, the Sri Lanka Army's Humanitarian Demining Unit has cleared a majority of 74 per cent,? he told Daily Mirror.
He said the teams of HALO Trust, Sri Lanka Army's Humanitarian Demining Unit, MAG, DASH and SHARP are engaged in mine clearance in the country.
Brigadier Atapattu said Polonnaruwa and Batticaloa Districts have been declared safe from landmines.
Minefields are yet to be cleared in the districts of Jaffna, Kilinochchi, Mullaitivu, Vavuniya, Mannar, Trincomalee, Ampara and Anuradhapura. (By Lahiru Pothmulla)

?
History-making order from the highest echelons of yahapalanaya has now gone to those manning the frontline to kick off the crash development programme designed to bring about a revolutionary upsurge in the country?s economy starting from the grassroots level.?
?
However, the departmental heads and the authorities at the district level had to suffer an agonizingly long-wait to receive the million- dollar letter from a top finance authority, authorizing the release of funds for the purpose, they say.
However, this finance authority who ever stays tuned to the developments in the country?s political scene and quite used to the ?play it safe? game, had kept artfully dodging the responsibility of inking the important circular letter.
Finally, a lesser mortal at the Ministry was compelled to sign the letter, they say.
Those knowing this episode have begun raising the question as to how this yahapalanaya could bring about any revolutionary change in the country with cowardly backboneless creatures at its helm, they say.?

Iran to use SL rupee for fuel trade
	
The Cabinet was told yesterday that Iran had agreed to use the Sri Lankan rupee as the medium of exchange to carry out its fuel trade transactions with Sri Lanka because of problems in using the US dollar because of economic sanctions likely to be imposed on Iran.
Iran is facing sanctions imposed by the United States making it difficult for it to international business transactions in the US dollar.
Sri Lanka purchases a bulk of its crude oil requirement from Iran and purified at the Sapugaskanda facility.
Iran's willingness to carry out its business transactions in Sri Lankan rupees was conveyed to the Cabinet by Minister Sarath Amunguma. Iran purchases large quantities of tea from Sri Lanka. (Kelum Bandara)

LEARNING TO BE DIFFERENT
	
A most informative message on my phone started me thinking of how different our country could be if we took examples from some of the other countries in the world, who have made their mark in world history!!! Apparently, the difference between poor and rich nations does not lie in the age of the nation and is ably demonstrated by countries like India and Egypt, which are more than 2,000 years old and are still poor countries!!! Conversely, Canada, Australia and New Zealand which were insignificant 150 years ago are today some of the world?s most developed and rich nations!!! Canada is even calling for migrants today!!! Significantly, the difference between rich and poor nations does not depend on the availability of natural resources; it depends solely on our lack of ATTITUDE AND THE WILL TO FOLLOW AND TEACH, THE PRINCIPAL BENEFITS OF WORKING, TO OUR PEOPLE!!!
Take Japan which has limited arable territory, 80% mountainous country unsuitable for agriculture but is THIRD IN THE WORLD?S ECONOMY!!! The Japanese have never forgotten or overlooked the importance of importing raw material from the whole world and exporting manufactured products with it!!!
?
Switzerland
All of us have been constantly looking at Switzerland to get the best chocolates in the world!!! Did we ever realize that in her small territory Switzerland rears animals and cultivates the land but only for four months of the year, and nevertheless manufactures the world?s best milk products!!! A small country indeed which is a beautiful glowing example of security and serenity with the strongest Bank in the world trusted for generations!!!
?
?
Be productive
We are told that executives from rich countries who interact with their counterparts from poor countries do not display any significant intellectual differences!!! Racial or colour factors do not evince importance: Migrants heavy in laziness in their own countries are forced to be productive in rich European countries!!! What is the difference then??? People?s attitude is the significant difference moulded by inherent education and culture!!! An analysis of people from rich and developed countries have proved that most of them abide by the basic principles of Ethics, Integrity, Responsibility, Respect for Law and Order, Respect for Majority of Citizens by Right and last but not least Their Love For Work!!! Coupled With This Is The Effort To Save And Invest, The Will To Be Productive and Punctual!!!
In poor countries, a small minority follow these basic principles in their daily lives!!! It is time we realized that we are not poor because we lack natural resources or because nature was cruel to us; we are poor because we totally lack correct attitude!!! We lack the will to follow and to teach these basic principles that contribute to rich and developed countries!!!
We let our people stick in the rut they have fallen into; we try to take advantage over everything and everyone when we absolutely cannot afford to do so!!! We see something done wrong and say ?LET It Be!? We Lack The Guts And The Courage To Change Our Attitude, To Move Forward, To Emulate Examples From Other Countries, To Take Our Thinking And Our Actions To A Higher Level, To Motivate Our People And Encourage Them To Make This Land A Better Place To Be Able To Say In All Sincerity And Pride ?This Land Is My Land, This Land Is Your Land, Let?s Make It A Better Land Made For You And Me?!!! Let?s Make It The Paradise It Used To Be!!!
?
Villa in Austria
Politicians come and go but what they do lives on, especially what they have garnered!!! We are told that a leading politician of the previous regime has acquired a VILLA in Austria, just a small VILLA!!! On a vast extent of land though!!! Photographs were taken by a German friend, who has visited Sri Lanka in the past, when he was on holiday in Austria in July 2018!!! We would also like to know if there is any person owning a Villa in Austria!!! The address is Gerlitzerstr. 43, 9521 Treffen, Austria!!! Unfortunately, the photographs showing ownership cannot be published, so perhaps we will have to be guided by the ownership tag on the photograph!!!

Beware of candies
More Frightening Than This, We Just Heard, Is A New Drug In Schools!!! It Is Known As ?Strawberry Quick? Which Is A Type Of Crystal Meth That Looks Like Strawberry Pop Rock, The Candy That Sizzles And Pops In Your Mouth, It Also Smells Like Strawberry And Is Being Handed Out To Kids In School Yards.!!! Kids Ingesting This Thinking Its Candy Are Being Rushed Off To Hospitals In Dire Condition!!! It Also Comes In Chocolate, Peanut Butter, Cola, Cherry, Grape And Orange!!! Please Instruct Your Children Not To Accept Any Candy From Strangers Or Even From A Friend!!!
?
?
Lecherous tuition
Another poser for the Education Department is the unhealthy lecherous ?TUITION CLASSES? that are going on!!! The classes are advertised as though they were cinema advertisements in very suggestive poses, all calculated to attract innocent children!!! A horrible culmination of one or two such incidents was in our newspapers where the Tuition Master in question had raped an innocent girl and then had the impudence to pass her on to his friend!!! Shouldn?t the Education Department have some jurisdiction over this untenable perversity that is going on??? Our children are the wealth of this nation and should be protected against ALL THIS EVIL!!! OVER TO YOU MR. MINISTER!!! Beware of this woman
As always, our country is in complete chaos, the GMOA finished its strike but we are told they intend to strike again, now a lightning train strike, with an impending bus strike and what more we wonder is waiting around the corner!!! Into this melee comes a damsel but not in distress, oh no, one who has concocted a scam, perhaps a highly mitigated bond scam!!! She visits your house with a group and is purported to be from the LPG Company; she carries company ID, Membership Cards and Chloroform and is very kindly offering you Rs. 200/- for gas stove maintenance!!! She usually asks for your toilet, then calls her group and explains the position and situation of the house, subsequent to which you will be chloroformed and your house robbed of all your possessions!!! If you look at this creature, she looks as though she can?t say boo to a goose!!! Very innocent looking, very decently dressed, all geared up to fool you!!! BEWARE!!!

New slogan ruffles other aspirants!
	
?
Once there was a popular commercial slogan which said: ?palamuwa Bata, dewanuwa paasala!? (Bata first. School next!)?
?
A political slogan reminiscent of that Bata slogan coined by a yahapalanaya bigwig has of late has found its way into the current political lexicon, they say.
This political slogan in Sinhala says: ?Palamuwa Suvapati. Dewanuwa Janapati!? which means Suvapati first. Janapati next!
The Diyawanna colleagues already backing the Suvapati argue that if being a Health Minister was a good stepping stone to the country?s Executive Presidency for a former Health Minister, why can?t the same portfolio be the stepping stone to the Presidency for its present holder?
However, the above political slogan reportedly spreading fast in the public domain has raised the heckles of several prominent members in the Green Front. And they have already begun planning to pull the rug from under the ambitious Suvapati?s feet. In fact, they have already supplied some weapons to the JO which the latter could use against the ?Suvapati?, they say.
So, a joint effort is said to be underway to ignite a veritable time bomb designed to cause serious political damage to ?Suvapati?.

Postmortem examination: SJTH to charge Rs.2,500
	
The Sri Jayewardenepura Teaching Hospital (SJTH) management has decided to charge Rs.2,500 for the postmortem examination on patients who had passed away while under treatment at the hospital, All Ceylon Medical Officers? Association (ACMOA) said yesterday.
In a letter sent to SJTH Chairman Athula Kahndaliyanage, the ACMOA General Secretary Jayantha Bandara demanded a clarification on the decision to charge Rs.2,500 for a postmortem examination at the Hospital.
Dr. Bandara said not a cent was charged for postmortem examination carried out in government hospitals and pointed out that they were carried out at the SJTH by government Judicial Medical Officers (JMOs) assigned by the South Colombo (Kalubowila) Teaching Hospital. Therefore, he said he could not see why such a fee was charged.
SJTH Acting Director Prabath Wewawatta said the Hospital management decided to charge Rs. 2,500 for a postmortem examination because the SJTH did not have JMOs in its cadre of doctors.
?We have to pay for postmortem examinations when we retain the services of JMOs from the Kalubowila Hospital. The cost is heavy for the SJTH and that is why the hospital management decided to charge Rs.2,500 from the next of kin,? Dr. Wewawatta said.
He said all private hospitals charge much more than Rs.2,500 such work. (Sandun A Jayasekera)

Sri Lankan racing driver Dilantha Malagamuwa said Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe had assured him that an independent investigation would be conducted over the alleged death threat.
Speaking to the Daily Mirror Mr. Malagamuwa said Premier Wickremesinghe had phoned him yesterday morning and told him that he would inform the police to conduct an investigation.
He also said he had informed the Law and Order Minister Ranjith Madduma Bandara about an alleged death threat he received two months ago.
A special police team had commenced investigations following a complaint made to the police Head Quarters on July 4 into an alleged plot to kill him.
According to sources, Mr. Malagamuwa had lodged the complaint based on information received from the police during an interrogation with an arrested underworld figure.
When answering a question raised by a journalist about death threats to Mr, Malagamuwa the Minister said that he had not been informed about any death threats on him.
If Dilantha informed the police, they will conduct the investigations without any other interference. No one will intervene in police investigations. Investigations would be conducted according to the complaint. We cannot put the blame on any accused until the investigations are over. Impartial legal actions will be taken against anyone accused of after the investigation. (Chaturanga Samarawickrama)

Ranil changed his decision to quit politics, says prelate
	
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe changed his decision to give up politics and leave the country several years ago following the advice of several leading Buddhist monks including the late Maduluwawe Sobhitha Thera, the Chief Incumbent of Mirisawetiya Venerable Ethalawetunu Wawe Dhanatilaka Thera said yesterday.
The Venerable Thera expressed these sentiments during a religious ceremony held at the Mirisawetiya Cheithiya to mark the present government?s completion of three years in office last evening.
?Prime Minister Wickremesinghe was planning to give up politics and leave the country for higher studies but gave up the idea following the advice of leading monks including the late Venerable Maduluwawe Sobhitha Thera and myself. We told him not to give up politics and remain here. I personally phoned him and told him to change his decision and he heeded my request,? the thera said.
He said the Prime Minister was very good at selecting and deciding on things.
?Mr. Wickremesinghe was heavily criticized for talking of Wi-Fi and he also predicted that coconut pluckers were going to own mobile phones around 30 years ago but today what he said has been proved to be correct,? the thera pointed out. (Yohan Perera and Athula Bandara in Anuradhapura)

Special Leave to Appeal : EFL granted to challenge unlawful electric fence
	
When elephants are prevented from accessing natural forest land they are compelled to use areas inhabited by humans
?
?
EFL granted Special Leave to Appeal to challenge an unlawful electric fence in Ehetuwewa, in an attempt to minimise the human-elephant conflict.?
?
Over the years, EFL has been ardently involved in combating the clearing of forest land in Sri Lanka
	?
	The Ehetuwewa and Galgamuwa Divisional Secretariat areas have the highest number of human-elephant conflicts ?
?
EFL was granted Special Leave to Appeal by the Supreme Court on August 1, 2018 in SC (Spl) LA 289/2017, relating to an illegal forest clearing and the subsequent erection of an electric fence within the immediate vicinity of the Nakolagane Purana Raja Maha Viharaya in Ehetuwewa, in the Kurunegala District.? ?
Over the years, EFL has been ardently involved in combating the clearing of forest land in Sri Lanka while ensuring complaints of such regard are brought to the notice of relevant Government officials. Since early 2015, EFL received various complaints from the Ehetuwewa Division relating to deforestation and/or use of forest land. The complaints received related to a large-scale clearing of approximately 15-20 acres of forest-land and the subsequent institution of an electric fence in the immediate vicinity of the Nakolagane Purana Raja Maha Viharaya, in Ehetuwewa. According to the information received, the large scale clearing and the subsequent mango plantation surrounding the temple premises were carried out by the Nakolagane Purana Raja Maha Viharaya in collaboration with funding by private investors.? ?

?
In order to comprehend the severity of the issue, it is vital to shed light on the significance of the geographic placement of this electric fence. The Ehetuwewa and Galgamuwa Divisional Secretariat areas are known to have the highest number of human-elephant conflicts in the North-West of Sri Lanka. The forest clearing and the subsequent institution of the electric fence were carried out by the temple against the instructions of the Department of Wildlife Conservation (DWC) and the provisions of law. The fenced area that was cleared was once one of the few natural forest patches left, forming a refuge for elephants crossing the region regularly in search of food and water. It was a critical part of their home- range. According to the GPS tracking data of radio collared elephants, this area falls within the home-range of over 200 elephants who use the natural neighbouring forest for their movements.? ?
The clearing and developing of this area will result in blocking the seasonal movement of elephants while leading to loss of critical resources and habitat. Inevitably, this will force the elephants to move to surrounding villages in search of food, increasing the destruction of crops and cultivation. When elephants are prevented from accessing natural forest land, they are compelled to use areas inhabited by humans. This leads to the escalation of the human-elephant conflict. At present, herds of elephants, consisting 100-200 animals, are seen in the mornings and evenings accessing the Palukadawala and Atharagalla water tanks, blocking the Ehetuwewa main road.? ?
Given the severity of the possible jeopardy caused to human lives and the environment, EFL together with two affected villagers in Ehetuwewa, who are members of a local group called ?Parisara Surakum Ekamuthuwa?, filed a Writ Application in 2017. However, the Court of Appeal refused to issue notice for this case on technical grounds. Subsequently, EFL filed a Special Leave to Appeal application to the Supreme Court.? ?
?

?
The Special Leave to Appeal application was heard before Justice Eva Wanasundara, Justice Prasanna Jayawardena and Justice Nalin Perera. The Court issued a bench order to set aside the Court of Appeal Judgment dated 07.11.2017. With the consent of all parties, the Judges of the Supreme Court ordered the Court of Appeal to rehear this case. Ananda Lal Nanayakkara appeared on behalf of the Petitioners.? ?
Through this litigation, EFL intends to prevent further aggravation of the existing human-elephant conflict in Ehetuwewa.??

The Rs.200,000 allowance - Only less than 55 MPs entitled: Ministry
	
The number of monitoring MPs receiving a transport allowance of Rs.200,000 each is less than 55 as several of them have been appointed as deputy ministers or state ministers, the Land and Parliament Affairs Ministry said yesterday.
Ministry Secretary W.H. Karunaratne said the allowance given to the parliamentarians assigned to monitor development projects had ceased on being appointed as ministers, deputy ministers or state ministers.
The transport allowance is paid in accordance with a Cabinet decision taken on June 21, 2016. Later, the Land and Parliamentary Affairs Ministry had taken the initiative to pay this allowance based on letters received from President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.
Mr. Karunaratne said they were making sure that a monitoring MP is not entitled to privileges given to both an MP and a deputy minister or a state minister.
The monitoring MPs who were recently appointed as State ministers are Lucky Jayawardana and Ranjith Aluvihare,e Ajith Mannapperuma and K. Kader Masthan,
Edward Gunasekara, Angajan Ramanathan, Nalin Bandara and Buddhika Pathirana were appointed deputy ministers.
Recently, joint opposition MP Gamini Lokuge said he had obtained the list of 55 MPs who were receiving a monthly transport allowance of Rs.200,000 each. He said he had obtained it under the Right to Information Act.

Verbal battles have been breaking out one after another within the JO for some time.? The battle that raged more furiously than the others was that between the Master Brain of Pohottuwa and the big-mouthed Panchaudha.?
?
The former strongman finding that the exchange of fire was going too far, called all protagonists for a peace powwow.?
The former strongman told both parties that their battle had taken an ugly turn and it was high time that they put an end to it. He also mentioned the name of a party stalwart from the upcountry as one pushing Panchaudha from behind.?
The former strongman was telling them in a harsh tone that that their job was to fight it out with the government and not fight among themselves when Panchaudha interposed: ?You are quite right, Sir. Here I am holding aloft a white flag!?
The Pohottuwa?s Master Brain too declared that he too was for making peace and that marked the end of their verbal battle.?
However, the JO members say in hushed tones that not even their boss would succeed in forcing their Kalutara colleague raising a battle cry these days to throw in the towel!?

He proceeded to recall that the strange conduct of this character came up for discussion at a recent informal meeting between the Pohottuwa faction and their hesitant colleagues still in yahapalanaya.?
This person, he said, though no more in the cricket administration had, on the eve of the last SL versus South Africa test in Galle had pressed those in authority to squeeze into the local team several players of his choice and in fact, he had also questioned the wisdom of including in the team some star players whom he did not like.?

UNP has two choices: Name Presidential Candidate  now or Perish
	
?
Approximately seventeen (17) months for the announcement of Presidential Election
	?
	UNP seems to be in a lethargic and slipshod ramble towards coming disaster
	?
	Indecision is one of the characteristics that the people hate
	?
	Ranil should waste no more time. Name the candidate now or perish
?
?Doubt increases with inaction. Clarity reveals itself in momentum. Growth comes from progress. For all these reasons, BEGIN.? ~Brendon Burchard
Today is August 15, 2018. The date for Presidential Election will be called by the Commissioner General of Elections between November and December 2019.
That leaves us with approximately seventeen (17) months. The two main protagonists will be a nominee from the United National Party (UNP) and another representing the Pohottuwa (Flower bud) in combination with the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) or someone from the Pohottuwa by itself.
The SLFP without the Pohottuwa support, if the recently held Local Government elections are of any reliable measure, would end up in the category of an also-ran.
Yet, one simply cannot ignore the erosion of the UNP voter bloc. It has been in evidence for the last twenty years.
Ever since the assassinations of Lalith Athulathmudali, R. Premadasa, and Gamini Dissanayake, in that order, the UNP has been suffering from a great deal of buyer?s remorse. No changes of any fundamental nature or creative and forward-looking transformation, with the galloping technological advancement of society, has been introduced to the Party.
Against the backdrop of the maddening rush on the part of the Pohottuwa bigwigs to ensure a plausible approach to the forthcoming Presidential Election in 2020, the UNP seems to be in a lethargic and slipshod ramble towards a coming disaster.
?
But those who wield power now, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and the rest of the Cabinet seem lost and forlorn
?
The obvious has been neglected. The demand for punishment of the Rajapaksa, the rest of the First Family and their henchmen for their atrocities when they were in office, is still vocal and real.
But those who wield power now, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and the rest of the Cabinet seem lost and forlorn.
Indecision is one of the characteristics that the people hate to see in a leader. On the other hand, risk-takers and those who dare to go to the edge of the possible are perceived as heroes. As Otto von Bismarck, the Prussian (German) Statesman of the 19th century, succinctly vocalized, ?Politics is the art of the possible, the attainable ? the art of the next best?.
So, the question is, can the UNP find such a daring man or woman in their midst, who will go to the edge of the abyss and challenge it without turning back?
The United National Party had such leaders and that was in the past. D. S. Senanayake, J. R. Jayewardene, Gamini Dissanayake, R. Premadasa and Lalith Athulathmudali were such outstanding ones.
They made politics the art of the possible.
Against great odds they were unrelenting; they challenged the status quo and dared to go further; they made their followers do the same-go thus far and further.
The people recognized that unequal quality in them and reposed their trust and faith in them. And they were successful. It may be an unattainable dream to expect leaders of such calibre from amongst the current crop of leadership in the UNP.
However, before jumping into this complex mosaic of the UNP leadership, one must examine the real and looming needs of the people.
The country is meandering along without any definitive goal. A rudderless boat has no shore to reach. In the midst of such uncertainty, against the valour of storms and contradictory forces of political nature, if the UNP is showing any signs of hesitancy or indecision, the people will interpret such indecision and hesitancy, and quite rightly so, as an abyssmal weakness. If there is any characteristic of the UNP and its leadership has been very consistent in displaying it is that extremely negative indecision.
Waiting until the nominations are called to start an election campaign is another element of naivet? the UNP has shown during this period, 1994 to 2015.
This foolhardy approach to elections is a direct byproduct of that quality, which has shaped and defined the United National Party and its current leadership.
Conceding certain valid and legitimate issues that could be embraced and owned by the UNP has betrayed the very essence of faith and trust in which the grassroots hold the Party.
Lack of charismatic leadership at the top has cost the Party its usual capability of attracting new votes, especially the fairer sex and youth. It is not rocket science to decipher the common and simple formula of message + process = campaign. Therefore, good message + good process = good campaign.
The UNP as one single political entity won a majority as against a plurality of votes and seats in Parliament only on three occasions. One was in 1952 after the demise of D. S. Senanayake and the second was in 1977 under the leadership of J. R. Jayewardene and third when R. Premadasa succeeded J. R. Dudley, J. R. and Premadasa were leaders of a bygone era.
That era will never come back, nor will the values and cultural ethos would never revisit our body politic in the future. In politics, everything is context as well as relative. The current societal makeup is such, in an ever-evolving technological life, changes are measured in seconds, not days, months and years. What would have taken weeks to see in print about a scandalous story on a politician are now ousted in seconds on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram or any scurrilous websites on the internet.
?
Ranil still can muster enough support to win the next Presidential Election and that chance is slim but still a fighting chance
?
Unless and until today?s politicians are ready and adequately equipped to handle this fast-developing aspect of communication, they should leave the field of politics as a livelihood.
In internet warfare, the UNP is far behind its rivals. That lack of awareness on the part of the UNP as an organism engaged in politics is not acceptable in the context of politics that is engulfing all and any human condition and exploiting that human condition to the advantage of the exploiter.
Being involved in the day-to-day activities of running a Government is no excuse. Managing their incumbency is part and parcel of Government-management.
Ranil Wickremesinghe?s tragic lack of awareness of this aspect of political life is a great encumbrance to the advancement of his Party?s ?younger guns?. The delegation of powers to the younger guns, unleashing their potential to the four corners of the country, exposing them to the vagaries of changing climates of hard and gruesome political life of a nation should be treated as a welcoming burden a leader has to bear.
Successful leaders of any field have shown the enormous advantage of such delegation.
Whichever way one turns, it is certainly not a kindly scenario one beholds. Progressive erosion of a voter-base cannot and should not be disregarded as an outlier.
For more than twenty years the UNP has been experiencing this negative voter-response at successive elections. Past election results show that each time the UNP fielded a candidate other than the one who had appeared on the earlier occasion, the new one has won. Dudley Senanayake after D S Senanayake in 1952, J R Jayewardene after Dudley Senanayake in 1977, R Premadasa after J R Jayewardene in 1989. Since then it?s been a total disaster. How the current leader Ranil Wickremesinghe takes this, the writer simply does not know. Also, this writer would not speculate as to how Gamini Dissanayake would have fared in 1994 after R. Premadasa?s death as it is utterly futile to indulge in such conjecture.
Yet, one cannot ignore the results of the 2001 elections, which in the estimation of the writer is a definitive outlier in terms of statistics.
Why the 2001 election results remains an outlier is proven by the results that followed in every election that was held thereafter, whether it was Presidential, Parliamentary, Provincial Council or other local government elections. The leader of the UNP who happens to be the current Prime Minister seems to have burnt all his chances.
Yet, Ranil still can muster enough support to win the next Presidential Election and that chance is slim but still a fighting chance.
What does he have to do in order to galvanize his party and attain an incredible victory? He has seventeen months.
He has his new Party Secretary in place, he has his Party Organizational Structure in gear and above all, he has a very credible and daring National Organizer, who is, to quote Star Trek TV series, willing and able to go ?Where no National Organizer has gone before?.
That is Navin Dissanayake. With Sajith Premadasa undertaking to look after the South and Navin to go to all corners of Sri Lanka, the way his father Gamini Dissanayake did during the Presidential Election in 1988 in support of Sajith?s father R. Premadasa, Ranil still can pull a rabbit out of the hat. But it is a Herculean Task.
Therefore, it is beyond doubt that announcement of the next Presidential Candidate now, not next week or month but now is a sine qua non.
To build a structure of a sophisticated election campaign takes time. Branding of the campaign, rebranding of the candidate, fund-raising, recruiting the right personnel, preparation of a colourful and attractive manifesto, planning and manning the campaign in the districts, micro-targeting the particular electorates and districts, construction of the core message, constant feeding of material to the media, running an unmatchable social media campaign take time.
So, Ranil Wickremesinghe, waste no more time. Name your candidate now or perish.

?Under a SLPP government all these agreements will be reviewed and any transaction which is detrimental to Sri Lanka will be suspended. As such prospective buyers must consider the risk involved in going ahead with these agreements. There is reason to believe that large scale corruption is taking place when finalising these agreements,? he told a news briefing.
Prof. Peiris said the Central Bank (CB) bond scam was being swept under the carpet but assured that an SLPP government would initiate fresh inquiries into this fraud.
?We will bring down Arjuna Mahendran within a month of forming a government and drastic action will be taken against not only primary dealers such as the PTL but also those involved in aiding and abetting in this fraud. We will do our best to recover the financial loss incurred,? he said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

Yet another horse in the race!
	
?
Some politicos suddenly discover that they are beneficiaries of Rajayoga when an election is close at hand.?
?
This story is about such a Rajayoga beneficiary hailing from Wayamba.?
This Diyawanna member who tried his political luck in several parties during his relatively short career threw in his lot with the Blue party in the recent past acknowledging the leadership of the Compassionate One.?
Meanwhile, an astrologer had predicted that a Rajayoga indicated in his Natal Chart was due to fructify shortly.?
Of course, the astrologer had revealed this prediction in confidence to him, but fired with high expectations, the ambitious politico had made it known to intimates, faithfuls and numerous well- wishers that the Rajayoga is powerful enough even to take him from the Number Two position to Number One itself in due course.

Youths in Swedish towns burn and vandalize cars

Youths torched and vandalized scores of cars in the Swedish city of Gothenburg and surrounding towns and Prime Minister Stefan Lofven said on Tuesday the disturbances looked organized ?almost like a military operation?.
It was unclear what triggered Monday night?s unrest but Sweden has seen a rise in violence in areas with high unemployment and other social problems and the incident echoed rioting in the capital Stockholm in 2013.
Mounting public concern about gang-related and other violence has become a central issue in campaigning ahead of a national election on Sept. 9.
Police said that up to 100 cars were either set fire to or vandalized in Gothenburg, Sweden?s second-biggest city located in the western part of the country, and in nearby towns such as Falkenberg and Trollhattan, an industrial area with high unemployment. There were no reports of injuries.
Two men, 16 and 21 years old, were arrested on Tuesday and police said it expected to make more arrests during the day.
