"Holidays on Tea" - Channel News Asia reviews Heritance Tea Factory
	
There is nothing quite like a truly unique relaxing holiday with a dash of adventure, especially one that involves largely unexplored locations. But before you jump on the already-popular getaways at the spa or on the beach, consider spending some time jaunting through tea plantations instead.
Sri Lanka, a tropical island-nation, has enchanted travellers for centuries. Formerly known as Ceylon, this tear-shaped island is resplendent in idyllic beaches, diverse wildlife, and lush tea fields that offer some of the worlds finest brews.
Just a few hours drive away from its capital Colombo is Sri Lankas hill country, a mountainous region draped in emerald greenery filled with tea plantations. This landscape has attracted many tea aficionados seeking new brews of adventure.
Nestled amid the tea plantations of Nuwara Eliya (six to seven hours drive from Colombo) in the hill country is a tea factory. Built in the 1930s during the British Raj, the Heritance Tea Factory has been beautifully restored by Heritance Hotels & Resorts, and is the only factory in the world to be converted into a unique hotel experience.
Four per cent of Sri Lankas land comprises tea plantations, says a spokesperson from Heritance Hotels & Resorts in Sri Lanka. The cool climes invite tea enthusiasts to enjoy the exclusive experiences that only this island can offer.

While there, take the chance to tick a UNESCO World Heritage Site off your bucket list by making a trip to Horton Plains, which is a short 1.5 hours drive from the Tea Factory. This grassland is known for the famous Worlds End, a steep slope that plunges nearly a kilometre to the lowlands.
Also worth a day trip is the sacred Adams peak, a mountain three hours away from the hotel that is scaled each year by thousands of devotees from several religions. Many travel here to catch a glimpse of the shadow of the peak, cast by the sun on the misty clouds below just after dawn. On a clear day, Colombo, which is 65 kilometres away, can be seen.
If youre a tea enthusiast who cant get enough of the outdoors, you will love Ceylon Tea Trails, a resort tucked within the green hills of Bogawantalawa that boasts four luxurious tea planters bungalows. Each residence has between four and six rooms, and comes with its own manager, chef, butler, and houseboys.
Bogawantalawa, located in the Central province of Sri Lanka, is known as the Golden Valley of Tea for the unique colour of its brews. It is in the hills of Bogawantalawa that some of the worlds finest black teas  the high growns as the locals call it  flourish.Originally built during the British colonial-era, the bungalows at Ceylon Tea Trails have been impeccably restored and are perfect for visitors searching for a unique experience.
Meander through the marked trails of the tea gardens that connect the bungalows, ride a mountain bike up the surrounding hills and valleys, or take a trip to the Norwood Tea Factory for some unique tea appreciation. The resident tea guru, Andrew Taylor, is reputed to have such a great passion for tea that by the end of the tour, youll leave with a new-found respect for the humble brew.http://www.heritancehotels.com/teafactory/

JVP give info on MR family today
	
	The Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) would meet the new Defence Secretary B. M. U. D. Basnayake today to provide him with information against former President Mahinda Rajapakas family members, a party official said.
	JVP Member of the Western Provincial Council Dr. Nalinda Jayatissa told a media briefing yesterday that they would call the Defence Secretary to conduct an inquiry on how former Presidents son Yositha Rajapaksa joined the Navy and obtained scholarships to study abroad.
	The college was originally known as the Royal Naval College, Dartmouth, and as a Royal Naval shore establishment was later additionally known by the ship name HMS Britannia. The college received its present name in 1953. Until 1941, Dartmouth was in effect a specialized boarding school, with parents paying fees for tuition and board.
	Today, officer cadets, as they are known until passing out from the college, can join between the ages of 18 and 26. This is the sole naval college in the United Kingdom.(Yohan Perera)

Video: JVP complains against Yoshitha
	
	The Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) today complained to Defence Secretary B.M.U.D. Basnayake against former President Mahinda Rajapaksas son Yoshitha who is a Lieutenant in the Sri Lanka Navy.
	JVP Western provincial councillor Nalinda Jayatissa said Yoshitha Rajapaksa did not have the minimum qualifications to be enlisted in the executive branch of the Navy.
	Navy Commanders are selected from the executive branch. One needs to pursue science subjects to join this branch. However, Mr. Rajapaksa was recruited in violation of these regulations, Dr. Jayatissa said.
	He said a scholarship which was reserved for the best cadet officer in any particular batch after he or she completed one years training was offered to Mr. Rajapaksa after a three-month training period.
	The selection of Mr. Rajapaksa as the best cadet is doubtful. However, he was offered the scholarship and was sent to Britains Britannia Royal Naval School (BRNC) in Dartmouth. He stay at the BRNC had to be extended to two and half years after he failed several subjects, Dr. Jayatissa said. 
	He said Mr. Rajapaksa had used and misused his rank in his involvement in his brother Namal Rajapaksas Nil Balakaya.
	Officers of the security forces should not engage in politics. He is also to be the owner of a private television network. These are all violations of the law, he said adding that the JVP had urged the Defence Secretary to take action against Yoshitha Rajapaksa if he did not returned for duty.
	The Secretary said he would call for an immediate report in this regard from the Navy Commander, he said. (Lahiru Pothmulla and Sanath Desmond)Video by Sanath DesmondPix by Nisal Baduge
