AGSEP Research Report Sheds New Light on Obstacles Faced in Promoting Tourism in Sri Lanka
	
AGSEP Research,a key unit of the Asian German Sports Exchange Programme (AGSEP),a recognised local non-commercial government-associated-organisation recently released new insights into obstacles faced by tourism promoters and investors in the country.
AGSEP,which supports the development of the country, has been instrumental for over a decade in publishing valuable key observations through its research and scientific surveys.?
AGSEP?s recently released research findings reveals key observations on the tourism industry and impediments which are hindering further growth and economic benefits.
Comparing other popular Asian tourist destinations, the report noted that Sri Lanka remains an underperforming destination. According to statistics of annual tourist arrivals among Asian countries, while Thailand and Malaysia enjoy over 35 million and 26 million respectively, Vietnam 10 million, Philippines 5 million and Laos 3 million, Sri Lanka is comparatively lower with approximately 2 million only.
Citing an example the report states that, Thailand?s Pattaya, through events and sports grew its visitors from 6.2 million arrivals in 2007 to 9.2 million in 2015. Similarly, through the development of reciprocal sports exchange programmes with Malaysia?s Langkawi Local Authority, Sri Lanka too can increase its visitor ratio.
Additionally, the report notes the key link between the promotionalbudget and the annual tourist arrivals.? Presenting the impressive marketing budgets for tourism incurred in countries such as Vietnam and Malaysia and the dismal budget allocated in Sri Lanka.
Noting the important relationship between the country?s travel and tourism contribution to GDP, citing a 2014 World Travel and Tourism Council Report, AGSEP notes Sri Lanka is placed a dismal 73 with tourism?s share being only 11.1% towardsGDP.
According to AGSEP, an increase in tourist arrivals will positively and directly influence the tourism sector?s contribution to the GDP.
Comparing Sri Lanka and Vietnam as a destination, AGSEP notes both countries showcase similar preconditions for tourism. However, in terms of arrivals Sri Lanka dismally lags behind.?
Based on a recent scientific research conducted in collaboration with the Ministry of Tourism, a total of 1000 questionnaires were answeredby tourists from 60 different visiting nations.?
The questionnaire respondents were asked a series of questions at the Bandaranaike International Departure section regarding detailsoftheir stay. Questions included particulars of their demographics, details and purpose of the visit, perception of local communities and individuals, experience encountered as an off-season visitor in terms of charges, weather etc., and included other qualitative questions including safety etc.
The respondents; 57% female and43% male with origins of countries included England, Australia, China and Germany.
Based on the findings, the 80% of the visitors experienced no negative effectsas a result of the onset of monsoon season, the research questioned the harmful and unjustified off-season concept citing the beneficiaries as the foreign operators, while the deprived sectors as a result of these perceptions being Sri Lanka?s hospitality sector.
Overall, based on the results of the survey, visitors had a positive result of their stay. 96% of tourists had felt welcomes, 84% confirmed they could make contact with locals and 80% praised the friendly, helpful and open-minded Sri Lankans.
Results and impressions of country?s natural beauty is also promising among visitors. With over 90% of those polled cited the opinion as ?true? being ?the variety of Sri Lanka?s nature as fascinating?.
Towards the development of tourism and arrivals to the country, AGSEPproposes a solution of ?Smart Marketing? as the remedy. This includes building Sri Lanka?s image and promoting the nation as an ideal destination all year?round ?12 month? destination.Additionally, the solution also needs to showcase Sri Lanka unique ?Smiles?and combine this with Lanka?s beautiful nature and wildlife.
AGSEP Research has also conducted research and feasibility studies on promoting Ella as a top tourism destination among young European travellers, promoting nautical tourism in the country through sailing and boating with vacation and holiday activities and also Sri Lanka as a retirement destination for senior citizens. AGSEP aims to publish the findings of these studies shortly.??

DFCC Bank PLC crowned one of Sri Lanka's ?Most Admired Companies?
	
Mr. Janz, Chairman, DFCC Bank receiving the award
DFCC Bank has been included in the Top 10 list of the ?Most Admired Companies of Sri Lanka? competition conducted by the Chartered Institute of Management Accountants (CIMA) and the International Chamber of Commerce Sri Lanka (ICCSL), selected from over 180 applicants.?
These awards recognize companies that not only demonstrate outstanding financial performance but also have built a strong corporate reputation over the years, creating value for shareholders, customers, employees and the general community. The companies within the Top 10 ranking are those that have proven their mettle through consistent, ethical, significant and sustainable growth, resulting in excellent business performance. Furthermore, the stringent criteria in place to select the Top 10 ensured that these awards are in line with reputed International Rankings.
Starting with over 180 companies named as most admired by employees, competitors, and stakeholders through a public survey run via Dialog, the judges selected the top 10 companies using a rigorous selection and interview process based on eight financial and seven qualitative criteria such as valuing human relationships, teamwork, fighting complacency and attacking big social problems, etc.?
Mr. Ravi Abeysuriya who chaired the Panel of Judges in his speech at the event stated that the differentials in the scores received by the top ten companies were waferthin. As a result, after much deliberation, the judges decided not to rank the top 10, as the 10 companies emerged from many industry sectors and sizes.
Speaking at the event, Mr. Jawahar Vadivelu, President of ICC India said, ?It is a great and deserving recognition for this evening?s 10 awardees to be chosen by the ICC Sri Lanka and CIMA to be amongst the most admired companies. In the context that companies operate in today, where the operating environment is in a constant state of flux, where the dynamics of competition are so severe, and in a world that is constantly being disrupted by the forces of technology, climate change, customer preferences and geo-politics, the pace at which companies need to keep evolving to sustain themselves and keep themselves relevant, is by itself great challenging. So, for these companies, to have remained on top of the constant forces of disruption, and to be regarded as admirable, is a singular honour, that deserves to be recognized and applauded.?
DFCC Award Group
Commenting on the prestigious accolade, Royle Jansz ? Chairman- DFCC Bank said, ?It is an honour to be counted amongst the Top 10 Most Admired Companies in Sri Lanka, as this is a testament to the dedication of the people of DFCC, both past and present. It is their attitude towards the performance of their duties, placing the customer above all, caring about the environment, their colleagues and fellow citizens that sets DFCC apart. These principles were laid down when the bank was established in 1955 by our founders, and has been diligently followed by those who came after. This award belongs to the people of DFCC and I am immensely proud to be a part of this wonderful group.?
Lakshman Silva ? CEO, DFCC Bank further added, ?It is a source of immense pride to be recognised as one of the Top 10 Most Admired Companies of Sri Lanka 2018 by the International Chamber of Commerce, Sri Lanka (ICCSL) and the Chartered Institute of Management Accountants (CIMA) Sri Lanka. DFCC Bank was judged on some key principles that embody comprehensive, consistent leadership practices. I am proud to say that DFCC's core values closely identify with the practices of transparency, credibility, trust and value creation. The DFCC of today is progressing on a foundation based on capital strength and an agility fostered by four pillars ? its employees, its financial technology, its franchise and a mindset of being a pioneer, a pathfinder and a trailblazer. Many of these traits are intangible ones, but they are understood and appreciated by our ever-widening customer base. I am committed to taking DFCC forward and to ensure that it keeps growing!"

Identities can be used to divide and to unite; choice is ours
	
Following is an extract of a letter, which appeared in the August issue of the Sri Lanka Medical Association newsletter written by SLMA President Dr. Ruvaiz Haniffa to its members.
?
Dear Member, ??think this is an opportune juncture to reflect upon what the SLMA set out to do at the beginning of the year and look towards the future from the perspective of the SLMA and Sri Lankan medical professions and medical professionals at large. ?
On the day I was elected as President of the SLMA on December 15, 2017 in my acceptance speech I noted that our profession would face challenges which could have an impact on how we practised medicine in Sri Lanka. Also in my message as President to the SLMA, I note ?Our founders deemed it fit to adopt ?Lankadipassa Kiccesu Ma Pamajii? (to act without delay for the betterment of our nation) as our motto, fully cognizant of the leadership role the SLMA is expected to play as the leading medical organization in the country representing all grades and all specialities of doctors from both the state as well as the private sectors. This milieu gives the SLMA its greatest asset; diversity within the medical profession, which enables it to capture and represent the widest and broadest possible ideas, views, concerns and expectations of the Sri Lankan medical profession. It is a fact that many generations of members of the SLMA have contributed to preserve, sustain and enrich this uniqueness. The health and healthcare scenario and what our patients expect from us as doctors and what we as doctors expect from our national medical association have changed over time. This is of course the way to go. This has necessitated a change in the role of doctors and national medical associations. The SLMA has been able to adapt itself to the changing expectation of its members and thereby be relevant to them over the past 131 years. The challenges we as members of the SLMA face today will be to institute mechanisms to ensure our significance to our future members while preserving our undisputed role as the academic, professional, moral and ethical guardian of the Sri Lankan medical profession. It is in achieving this objective that each and every member of the Sri Lankan medical profession, whether he or she is a member of SLMA or not, has an obligation to become a part of?.
It would be fair to say that we as a medical profession are at crossroads in terms of how we practised medicine and how we interact within and without the profession on matters and issues concerning the medical profession and medical professionals. The immediate cause of this, in my opinion is that, we as a profession have a crisis of identity. The underlying cause of this crisis I believe began several decades ago with the dramatic transformation of Sri Lankan society in terms of economic and technological advancement. This transformation necessitated that the medical profession/professionals also transform to keep pace with the economic and technological demands of society. In Sri Lanka, this transformation ( or lack of it) occurred at best in an ad hoc manner. This ad hoc transformation (or lack of it) did not take a holistic view of the ideas, concerns and expectations of the various medical professional stakeholders and general public who we as professionals are committed to serve.??
In an article titled Against Identity Politics: The New Tribalism and Crisis of Democracy in the September/October 2018 issue of the journal Foreign Affairs Francis Fukuyama, Olivier Nomellini Senior Fellow at the Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies at Stanford University, states ?Most economists assume that human beings are motivated by the desire for material resources or goods. This concept of human behaviour has deep roots in Western political thought and forms the basis of most contemporary social science. But it leaves out a factor that classical philosophers realized was crucially important: the craving for dignity. Socrates believed that such a need formed an integral ?third part? of the human soul, one that coexisted with a ?desiring part? and a ?calculating part?. In Plato?s Republic, he termed this the thymos, which English translations render poorly as ?spirit?. Thymos is expressed in two forms. The first is what I call ?megalothymia?: a desire to be recognized as superior. Pre-democratic societies rested on hierarchies, and their belief in the inherent superiority of a certain class of people-nobles, aristocrats, royals- was fundamental to social order. The problem with megalothymia is that for every person recognized as superior, far more people are seen as inferior and receive no public recognition of their human worth. A powerful feeling of resentment arises when one is disrespected. And equally powerful feeling-what I call ?isothymia?- makes people want to be seen as just as good as everyone else.
In the same article Fukuyama further states (and I have para phrased here a bit) ?the medical profession needs to protect marginalized and excluded groups, but they also need to achieve common goals through deliberation and consensus. The shift of focus in the agendas of various fragmented groups within the medical profession in Sri Lanka towards protection of narrow group identities ultimately threatens that process. The remedy is not to abandon the idea of identity, which is central to the way that modern people think about themselves and their surrounding societies; it is to define larger and more integrative national medical identities that take in to account the de facto diversity of the entire Sri Lankan medical profession/professionals?.
?
"It would be fair to say that we as a medical profession are at crossroads in terms of how we practised medicine and how we interact within and without the profession on matters and issues concerning the medical profession and medical professionals"
Fukuyama concludes his article thus ?Fears about the future are often best expressed through fiction, particularly science fiction that tries to imagine future worlds based on new kinds of technology. In the first half of the 20th century, many of those forward- looking fears centred on big, centralized, bureaucratic tyrannies that snuffed out individuality and privacy: think George Orwell?s 1984. But the nature of imagined dystopias began to change in the later decades of the century, and one particular strand spoke to the anxieties raised by identity crisis. So-called cyberpunk authors such as William Gibson, Neal Stephenson and Bruce Sterling saw a future dominated not by centralized dictatorships but by uncontrolled social fragmentation facilitated by the Internet. The good thing about dystopian fiction is that it never comes true. People today can imagine their countries as better places that support increasing diversity and yet that embraces a vision for diversity can serve a common purpose. People will never stop thinking about themselves and their societies in identity terms. But peoples? identities are neither fixed nor necessarily given at birth. Identities can be used to divide, but it can also be used to unify. That, in the end, will be the remedy for the identity crisis of the Sri Lankan medical profession/professionals?.
It is obvious that we as a profession/professionals are moving towards the opposing dystopias of hyper centralization and endless fragmentation. As the apex national professional medical body representing all grades of doctors both in the state and private sector in Sri Lanka the SLMA needs to play a role to steer the profession/professionals towards a utopia rather than a dystopia. We need to act together without delay for the betterment of the profession and keep true to our motto ?Lankadipassa Kiccesu Ma Pamajii?(to act without delay for the betterment of our nation).????

Indefinite country-wide strike from September 24: bus associations
	
All Ceylon Private Bus Association (ACPBA) and the Private Bus Workers? Association (ACPBWA) today warned that they would launch a country-wide indefinite strike from September 24 midnight, demanding a hike in fares and due to the revision of recent traffic fines.
ACPBA Secretary Anjana Priyanjith told the Daily Mirror that took the decision following a discussion with all the private bus associations at Narahenpita today.
He said that at the discussion all associations agreed to have an immediate bus fare hike following the increase in the diesel price.
The price of diesel had increased by 12.84 per cent.
?This increase is three times higher than the percentage of fuel price increment of four per cent according to the National bus fare increment policy,? Mr Priyanjith said.
He said they didn?t expect the Transport Minister to increase the fares.
?If he tried to do so, the minimum bus fare should be Rs. 15 which is now at Rs.12. All bus fares should be increased by ten per cent,? he said.
?Next week they (Government) will increase the bus fare according to a formula of their own,? Mr Priyanjith added.
According to the National Policy on Bus Fare Increment - fares will continue to be regulated by the National Transport Commission as per Bus Fares Policy of the Government.
Meanwhile, the Inter-Provincial Private Bus Association (IPPBA) President Sarath Vijitha Kumara said they would not join the strike.
He said the Ministry had requested the IPPBA for a discussion Wednesday morning. ?There we going to request the bus fare hike or the fuel concession Minister.
"We can?t decide on joining the strike without a clear decision from the Ministry and our decision would be taken after Wednesday," Kumara said. (Chaturanga Samarawickrama)

JHU wants general amnesty for military personnel, LTTE cadres
	
The Jathika Hela Urumaya(JHU), an ally of the government, today called for a general amnesty to all the military personnel and LTTE cadres charged for war crimes.
Its stalwart Megapolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka told a news conference that the Attorney General's Department should determine war related crimes in this case.
He said the members of Tamil parties that helped the military should also be granted such an amnesty under this.
He said the consent of all the Tamil political parties should be secured in this regard.
However, he said neither had an Act been brought to Parliament to rehabilitate and release LTTE members nor was there a Cabinet approval and said that some 12,000 LTTE members were released.
On such grounds Minister Ranawaka said the enforcement of law only against state security forces had led to public disappointment.
The JHU proposed to the Government to appoint a committee comprised of specialists under the aegis of the Attorney General?s Department, to identify war crimes and crimes committed for private motives, during the civil war. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

Mambo to Colombo
	
The sultry sounds of South America will bring alive the swinging traditions of one of Asia?s most iconic properties with the opening of ?King of the Mambo? at the Galle Face Hotel in October. Sri Lanka?s revered oceanfront luxury heritage hotel will play host to a new era of fun, refinement and entertainment by bringing back the ?mambo? as the dance movement is set to once again shake the city and its hotel guests.
Launched in partnership with Dubai-based management company Infini Concepts, the Latino lounge-restaurant concept will be styled in 50s d?cor and introduce classic cocktails, creative culinary specialities and a roster of entertainment as the relaxed, sunset-facing space invites guests to dress up, and dance the Mambo to the songs of legends such as P?rez Prado and Tito Puente.
?The Galle Face Hotel has been in my family for generations and it gives me great pleasure to delve into our illustrious past and connect with the spirit of the hotel. We have had many famous guests and it is in honour of those who stayed with us in the 50s when the mambo was at its height of popularity. We are excited to introduce this concept,? said Galle Face Hotel Chairman, Sanjeev Gardiner.
The Galle Face Hotel is a legend of Southeast Asian hospitality and the oldest hotel east of the Suez. The property originally opened in 1864, and over the years has evolved to encapsulate Sri Lanka?s colonial history while embodying its independent present. By the late 19th century the hotel was recognized as the best place to stay in Asia and today it is regularly billed as a must visit property worldwide. The hotel?s veranda has played host to many guests; Vivian Leigh, Carrie Fisher, Roger Moore and Anthony Bourdain are just a few of the well-known names that chose the hotel for their stay in Colombo. Sir Arthur C. Clarke lived in the hotel for a year while writing the final chapters of 3001: The Final Odyssey, one of his most famous works to date.?
?Galle Face Hotel has been a hospitality leader in Asia for over 150 years and we will continue to innovate while remaining true to our roots and traditions,? said The Galle Face Hotel General Manager and Area Vice President, Robert Hauck. ?The King of the Mambo is an entertainment concept inspired by a dance movement that originated from Cuba and one that was as relevant and vibrant then as it is today. We are delighted to bring this great music and dance tradition back to Colombo in partnership with Infini Concepts.?
Over the last decade Infini Concepts has launched and managed several successful venues and brands across the world such as Cavalli Club, Sumosan, Billionnaire Mansion and Miss Tess. The company has a strong reputation in the dining and nightlife circuit. The joint-venture between Infini Concepts and Galle Face Hotels has established Infini Restaurant Management (Pvt) Ltd, which will oversee the day to day operations of the venue.?
The vibe is trendy casual, says David Lescarret, Managing Director of Infini Concepts. ?The Galle Face Hotel is just one of those places in Colombo that is effortlessly cool. Maybe it?s because the hotel knows exactly what the cosmopolitan traveller and diner needs from all the years of catering to refined palates. This fits perfectly with the vision we have for King of the Mambo.??
?We see Colombo becoming one of Asia?s hottest destinations over the next few years - in fact it already is,? added David Lescarret. ?The Galle Face Hotel is at the center of this development in the city - and what better way to appreciate this beautiful heritage property than with a nice mojito, maybe at sunset, with great company before an exquisite dinner and perhaps a night out? That?s the space we see King of the Mambo becoming once it opens in October.?
The King of the Mambo opens in October and will be open daily from 12noon to midnight and will feature nightly entertainment. Bookings are recommended.

Maneka Gandhi requests President to free elephant ?Bandula?
	
Indian Minister and animal rights activist Maneka Gandhi has written to Sri Lankan President Maithripala Sirisena requesting him to free elephant ?Bandula? from Dehiwala Zoo, the NDTV reported on Monday.
In her letter, Ms.Gandhi said many in Sri Lanka have reached out to her about the "plight of Bandula" who is in chains for last 67 years.
There were reports about bleeding wounds on Bandula's limbs, due to heavy chains for years.
?Sri Lanka is such a gentle and beautiful island. It seems out of character to treat the elephant this way. Send the elephant to the Ridiyagama National Park to live free,? Ms.Gandhi said.
The minister cited examples in India about how elephants are banned in zoos and the elephants look stressed when chained as they have the same sensitivities as humans.

Quo Vadis... or Which Way  Sri Lanka - EDITORIAL
	
?
our major political events more than any other, helped shape Sri Lanka?s modern destiny. The winning of independence on February 4, 1948 under D.S. Senanayake as the first Prime Minister of then independent Ceylon, set in motion events that were to create the first seeds of communal suspicion between the Sinhalese and the Tamil communities in the country. ?
The Prime Minister saw the ?Ceylon Citizenship Bill? a necessity due to the failure of talks with the Indian government to settle the issue ?migrant Indian workers? - Up Country Tamils.? The then Prime Minister?s stated concern as reported in the ?Hansard? was that the voting patterns in the Kandyan areas where the Up Country Tamils -who voted at the first parliamentary elections as British citizens - deprived the Kandyan villagers of representation in the newly elected parliament. The leadership of the Tamil community however saw this piece of legislation as a effort to reduce the representation of Tamils in parliament.? ?
The April 12, 1956 election of SWRD Bandaranaike as prime minister, marked a significant change in the political history of then Ceylon. Bandaranaike advocated a non-aligned foreign policy, introduced the ?Sinhala Only Act? replacing English as the national language and making Sinhalese the official language of the country. Buddhism was also given primacy in the affairs of state. The Tamils saw these changes as moves aimed at discriminating against them. Protests marches and demonstrations broke out in the north and east of the country. Opportunistic forces used the protests to fan racism and the first Sinhala-Tamil race riots broke out in the country. Communal antagonism has deteriorated ever since.??
The election of JR Jayawardene in July 1977 completely changed Sri Lanka?s political landscape. In August 1978, Prime Minister Jayewardene introduced constitutional changes and the position of an Executive President was introduced. His pandering to populist forces in face of growing ethnic or communal tensions led to the disastrous, near three-decade-long civil war. Jayawardene also brought about a turnaround in the economic policies followed since independence and opened the state-controlled economy to market forces, with his famous slogan ?let the robber barons come...?.??
Today, 40 years later, the robber barons with their anticipated big injection of foreign capital into the economy have yet to come. Instead we had a plethora of injections of loans from the World Bank, the IMF and more recently the Chinese government. No real private investments as the government expected. Sadly, perhaps due to bad marketing strategies we have had mainly fly-by-night overseas garment manufacturers investing in the country... with few major investors if any, introducing new technologies or the transference of technology taking place.?? The civil war which played no small role as a disincentive in attracting direct foreign investment into the country was brought to an end under the Presidency of Mahinda Rajapaksa (November 2005-January 2015) on? May 18, 2001. Despite failing to attract foreign exchange, the opening up of the country to market forces resulted in mega corruption rackets.??
Ministers under Jayawardene?s regime have been accused of purchasing enormous estates abroad with ill gotten gains from commissions paid to them. Yet others were accused of illegal shipping deals. Jayawardene himself was however not accused of making personal profit from the deals taking place under his watch.?? Under President Rajapaksa -to whose credit stands ending the civil war- corruption rose to new heights and ultimately the popular president was voted out of office in 2015 by the present regime whose campaign was based on ending maga corruption rackets alleged to have taken place under the Rajapaksa presidency.??
Sadly, despite being elected to power on an anti corruption agenda, bringing to an end the executive presidential form of government and lowering the cost of living, the present regime was itself soon embroiled in a mega financial scandal which saw the finance minister dismissed and the prime minister himself accused of involvement in the scam. The President himself who vowed to be a one-term president prior to election, seems to be now looking for ways and means of extending his term. The cost of living is skyrocketing and the masses are in a near state of penury.
Today, the presidential elections are looming and the same corrupt faces of those who made ?hay while the sun shone? during their tenure in power are back asking for your vote and mine.?? The local robber barons of the past and present are begging us to vote for them... one more time! Whither Sri Lanka.?

SL embassy staff in Austria recalled to send a message: President
	
While confirming that the entire staff of the Sri Lankan Embassy in Austria including its Ambassador was recalled, President Maithripala Sirisena today said he ordered to do so to send a message across to other Sri Lankan missions as well.
Addressing the National Ozone Day celebrations at the BMICH in Colombo, the President said his staff tried to contact the Embassy in Vienna, Austria for four and a half hours because he wanted to speak with the Sri Lankan Ambassador there.
?However, no one was available to respond to at least one of the six phones at the embassy. Therefore, the entire Sri Lankan staff from the ambassador to the labourer was recalled. The staff will return soon. I made this order to send a message to other embassies as well,? he said.

SL?s Indian Ocean Diplomacy amidst shifting power alignments
	
?
Premier Ranil Wickremesinghe addresses at the Inaugural Session of the Indian Ocean Conference 2018 in Hanoi, Vietnam
?
The Indian Ocean has been the focus of frequent and intense diplomatic activity in the past few years. These interactions have had a regional character, while the involvement of external players in the discussions has also been notable. These developments, while they highlight the centrality of the Indian Ocean to big power competition in an evolving multi-polar world, at the same time demand critical appraisal. Smaller players like Sri Lanka especially need to be mindful of who?s setting the agenda at these deliberations, and alert to the ever-shifting power equations between and among the big players.? ?
?
"US foreign policy particularly under the Trump administration is rooted in the idea of US ?exceptionalism? ? which it uses to bully the rest of the world into compliance with its wishes, using the threat of sanctions"
With its pivotal geographical location in the Indian Ocean, Sri Lanka has naturally been an active participant in these forums. Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe?has addressed three Indian Ocean Conferences (IOCs) ? in Singapore (2016), Sri Lanka (2017) and Vietnam (2018) and this month participated in a panel discussion of the World Economic Forum on ASEAN, again in Vietnam, where he spoke on ?Asia?s geopolitical outlook.?? ?
The Prime Minister in his speeches at the three IOCs has, to his credit, adopted a somewhat independent stance rather than uncritically ?toeing the line? of any big power. Although he supports ?freedom of navigation and overflight? ? which is the rallying call of the US, endorsed by its allies in the face of ever-growing Chinese maritime influence - Wickremesinghe has consistently made a case for the littoral states to play a more assertive role in setting the rules. ?The littorals, by geographic design, are integral partners in this process? he said at the conference on ?Building regional architectures? in Ha Noi last month. ?
Another consistent thread in his presentations has been his questioning of the concept of ?Indo-Pacific,? a US creation. He asserts that the Indian Ocean and the Pacific Ocean are distinct entities. India too has been careful in its use of terminology in this respect.? ?
At the inaugural IOC in Singapore (2016), PM Wickremesinghe called for ?an inclusive, multilateral strategic security order? warning that there will be ?resistance to any country unilaterally trying to shape the strategic order of the region.? He further said ?This order should be built on a consensual agreement and no singular state should dominate the system.?? ?
?
"The US has been strengthening naval ties with strategically located states, encouraging its allies to do likewise (joint exercises of the ?Quad? for example), renaming the Pacific Command as ?Indo Pacific Command,? etc.,"
The question for analysts would be how the PM proposes to reconcile the laudable goal of a democratic, consensus-based order, with the hegemonic stance adopted by the world?s superpower. US foreign policy particularly under the Trump administration is rooted in the idea of US ?exceptionalism? ? which it uses to bully the rest of the world into compliance with its wishes, using the threat of sanctions. This belligerent approach is most apparent in its policies towards Russia and China. In a statement last month to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on the subject of ?US strategy towards the Russian Federation,? Assistant Secretary for European and Eurasian Affairs Wess Mitchell is reported as saying:? ?
?Russia and China are serious competitors that are building up the material and ideological wherewithal to contest U.S. primacy and leadership in the 21st Century. It continues to be among the foremost national security interests of the United States to prevent the domination of the Eurasian landmass by hostile powers.?
Last year, former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson in a speech in Washington named China as the cause for the US?s intensified interest in the Indian Ocean, and as the reason for its deepening defence ties with India.??
?Joining? the Indian and Pacific Oceans at the conceptual level by using ?Indo-Pacific? terminology is but one of the devices serving US strategic interests in the IOR. The US has been strengthening naval ties with strategically located states, encouraging its allies to do likewise (joint exercises of the ?Quad? for example), renaming the Pacific Command as ?Indo Pacific Command,? etc., etc. But the littorals of the Indian Ocean would not want to be bullied by the US any more than the littorals of the South China Sea resent being bullied by China. ?
?
"At the inaugural IOC in Singapore (2016), PM Wickremesinghe called for ?an inclusive, multilateral strategic security order? warning that there will be ?resistance to any country unilaterally trying to shape the strategic order of the region"
?
India-US strategic ties got a boost recently when the inaugural round of talks among their respective ministers of defence and foreign affairs (dubbed ?2 + 2 talks?) culminated with a defence agreement in Delhi, hailed as a breakthrough by both parties. The COMCASA (Communications Compatibility and Security Agreement) signed after years of negotiation on Sept. 6 would align India?s military communications systems with those of the US and facilitate ?interoperability? between their forces, according to reports. It is the second of three ?foundational agreements? the US expects to conclude with India, designated a ?major defence partner? of the US.
What is interesting is that the agreement was signed in spite of India having gone ahead with its deal with Russia to purchase S-400 missiles, according to reports, in defiance of US sanctions under a recent US law designed to punish third parties having dealings with its adversaries. Under the ?Countering America?s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act? (CAATSA) as it is called, the US would impose penalties on countries buying oil from Iran or having military transactions with Russia. This refusal to submit to US pressure has been praised by Indian analysts, who feared India?s foreign policy was tilting too much towards the US. The US would now have to find ways of granting India a waiver of sanctions, it would seem. ?
?
"The littorals of the Indian Ocean would not want to be bullied by the US any more than the littorals of the South China Sea resent being bullied by China"
?.. the CAATSA provides an underpinning for the US? global hegemony, which is far beyond its stated purpose of sanctioning Russia over the Crimea? wrote Melkulangara Bhadrakumar, commenting on the COMCASA on ?Strategic Culture Foundation? website. ?Simply put, without India realizing it, a point will be reached when it gets ?locked in? and becomes an ally of the US, playing second fiddle to Washington in its Indo-Pacific strategies? he warned.? ?
Indian Analysts have also noted that PM Modi?s policy towards China has become more nuanced, particularly since his informal and cordial April summit with China?s President Xi Jinping in Wuhan. Senior Analyst at the IDSA (Institute for Defence Studies and Analysis) P. Stobdan referring to Modi?s keynote speech at the Shangri La dialogue in June noted that his remarks ?seemed a calibrated move to prevent India falling into a dangerous geopolitical trap vis-?-vis US, Russia and China.? He said the speech was ?welcomed by everyone including China.?
?
"Indian Analysts have also noted that PM Modi?s policy towards China has become more nuanced, particularly since his informal and cordial April summit with China?s President Xi Jinping in Wuhan"
?
In Ha Noi last week, responding to a question from Indian defence analyst Nitin Gokhale on the ?new Indo-Pacific structure,? PM Wickremesinghe reportedly said ?We are Asian so we have a common identity, but I think the distinct nature of the Indian Ocean and the geo-politics of this ocean must function as it is and you can?t use the Pacific issues to cover the Indian Ocean issues. But together we can all work for a stable order and to ensure freedom of navigation.? It remains to be seen whether his optimism was warranted.?

Sri Lanka detains 5 Indians over fixing fears
	
Sri Lanka cricket's anti-corruption unit detained five Indian spectators on suspicion of match-fixing during Sunday's third and final women's ODI between the hosts and India, an official said.
The five were initially asked to leave the ground at Katunayake, just north of the capital Colombo, and later detained by police for investigations, the official said.
"We felt their behaviour was suspicious at the grounds and all of them were seen excessively communicating on their phones," the Sri Lanka cricket official, who declined to be named, told AFP.
"We exercised our right to remove them from the ground and the police took over the investigation." Authorities believe that the suspects may have had links with foreign gambling operations. Betting on sports is illegal in Sri Lanka . Police said they were questioning the suspects. Sri Lanka won Sunday's match by three wickets, but India won the three-match tournament 2-1. Last month, two Indians were apprehended in Sri Lanka after officials spotted them behaving suspiciously and making repeated calls on their mobile phones during a domestic T20 tournament match. Since last month Sri Lanka Cricket has deployed more anti-corruption officials at match venues.
Sri Lanka has also announced plans for tougher laws against sports corruption and a special police unit to deal with match-fixing following an Al-Jazeera documentary in May exposing corruption in global cricket in which three Sri Lankan officials were filmed agreeing to sway matches.

## Title: Tank cascade system will improve water quality of dry and intermediate zone of Sri Lanka

Tank cascade system will improve water quality of dry and intermediate zone of Sri Lanka
	
According to world history, many civilizations such as Indus, Mexican, Maya and Inca were originated with the association of rivers and had a long history and flourished with power and knowledge and faded away with the passing time.
Civilization in Sri Lanka is also associated with a Malwathu Oya river, but our civilization is referred to as hydraulic civilization mainly because of the tank cascade system and also the manmade incredible hydraulic structures present over the dry and intermediate zone of the country.
Therefore our civilization did not vanish though it had risen and fallen during the past.
However, at present, an appreciable percentage of people in the dry zone of Sri Lanka- earlier known as Rajarata and Ruhunurata where hydraulic civilization that thrived- is suffering from Chronic Kidney Disease of unknown aetiology (CKDu).
Analyzing its widespread geographical distribution and histopathological evidence, CKDu is considered a problem related to the environment.
We observed that many hypotheses have been proposed as causative factors for CKDu and established at present as a multifactorial origin. However, these associated factors are related to water. We believe that this occurrence is due to the drastic changes that happened to the hydraulic system of the dry and intermediate zone of the country.
?
"Most of the people affected by CKDu are from the dry zone"
There is a growing concern over the high incidence of CKDu in the dry and intermediate zone of Sri Lanka, and the ancient tank cascade system with its ecological functions has a potential for controlling this disease.
This article discusses the components of the tank cascade system in improving the water quality of the area.
Figure 01 shows the divisional secretariat level distribution of CKDu patients in Sri Lanka, while figure 02 exhibits the distribution of small tanks in Sri Lanka.
We noted that the CKDu patient spatial distribution is approximately similar to those of tank spatial distribution.
There are no reports indicating that the CKDu prevailed and significant death tall occurred during history in these regions.
According to history, people in the area used to get potable water from the tanks. Therefore we argue that the adverse changes that took place to the ecosystem of the tank cascade system and new commercial practices of agriculture of dry and intermediate zone of the country have also become reasons for the spreading of CKDu.
What is tank cascade system?
In order to overcome the limited water availability during May to September period, the ancient Sinhalese developed their own water management system now known as the Tank Cascade System.
?A tank cascade is a connected series of tanks organized within a meso-catchment of the dry zone landscape, storing, conveying and utilizing water from an ephemeral rivulet? (Madduma Bandara, 1985).
?This system has been recognized as a Globally Important Agricultural Heritage Systems? (GIAHS) by the FAO in 2018.
The watershed boundary of the meso-catchment, the individual micro-catchment boundaries of the small tanks, the main central valley, side valleys, and axis of the main valley, component small tanks, and the irrigated rice lands are the main elements of a cascade.

Wewa is the main element of tank cascade system and Wewa refers to an artificial lake for storing water on the surface of the ground, which has been constructed by local people at a geographically suitable location using their indigenous skills mostly during ancient times.
Ancient people used to get drinking water from a separate place called Diyamankada of the tank where they planted Kumbuk trees. Kumbuk tree is believed to purify and cool the water, and believed to have an ability to reclaim saline and alkali soils and reduce soil erosion on banks.
Even when the water quantity is less in the tank, villagers were used to getting the water to a clay pot, filtered using a piece of cloth and add Ingini seeds to purify the water.
According to studies, Ingini seeds have the capability of settling? down the clay and other suspended matter in the water and softening? it. However, after the introduction of groundwater wells to the dry zone in the 1950s, people used groundwater as a source of drinking water.

Components of Wewa and their roles in managing the water pollutants
Wewa consists of some bio-engineering structures in order to conserve the soil, control water flow and purifying water. Schematic representation of components of the small tank is shown in figure 04. Proper functioning of these components, the earthen dam (We-kanda), sluice gates (Sorrowwa), spillways (Pita Wana), valve pit (BissoKotuwa), iswetiya (upstream conservation bund), gasgommana (upstream wind barrier made of tree plantations), kattakaduwa (downstream wind barrier, located in between the sluice and paddy), tisbamme (land strip around the hamlet for protection), thaulla (upper peripheral gentle sloping land) and wew ismaththa (closer catchment) ensure the better quality, quantity and sustainability of the water for the wewa. At present, all these components may not be present in all small tanks in a cascade system.
?
Wew Ismaththa (closer catchment)
There was essentially an upstream land area dedicated to the tank from which water drained to the tank (closer catchment) through Wew thaulla. The extent of this area depended on the water area of the tank and this area was maintained as a forest in the past.
At present, the closer catchment is very rarely observed in small tanks. Kuluwewa, Godawala and ephemeral streams are generally located in Wew Ismaththa (Fig.04). Wew Ismaththa is protected and cutting trees and chena cultivation is prohibited. The purpose of the area was to increase the groundwater table through infiltration and thereby gradual release of water to the tank during the dry season is expected. Farmers under the headmen of the village were used to grow trees in these areas such as Weera, Kumbuk, Palu, Mee, Thibiri, etc. and establish vines such as Kobbawel, Eraminiya and Thiththawel thinking that these would absorb more water during the rainy season and drain those absorbed water to the tank slowly. A resulting biotic environment is an ideal place for diverse macro and microfauna.
These micro and macro-organisms purify water reaching from upstream tank command areas in this system. Scientists have proved that plants in the biotic-environment can absorb herbicide molecules sorbed onto organic matter and soil microorganisms can degrade the herbicide molecules. Scientific studies showed that some herbicides like glyphosate showed not to leach at all and remain tightly sorbed onto organic complexes. Tree roots and enhanced level of soil organic matter from tree litter improve the soil structure, aggregate stability and promote faunal activity leading to higher macroporosity so that infiltrated water passes through the soil matrix. Generally, pollutants are adsorbed to the clay and sediment particle. This environment in the Wew Ismaththa filters sediments and also pollutants adsorbed to the sediment particle may not then reach to the tank water. Thus, closer catchment had a higher potential to clean the drainage water reaching from the upstream command area where paddy and other field crops grown.
If this area is re-established and conserved as in the early days, there is still a potential to improve the tank water quality even though the upstream area is heavily cultivated with recommended doses of agrochemicals following integrated pest and nutrient management techniques.
?
Thaulla (upper peripheral gentle sloping land)
The area just below Wew Ismaththa and in between Wew Ismaththa and water spread area of the tank is Wew thaulla. This micro-land region is partly covered with water but only completely flooded during the rainy season. As shown in figure 04, the area where Gasgommana and Perahana are located can be considered as thaulla. Thaulla doesn?t allow water flow of the upstream area/ upper catchment to directly reaching it as a storm.
Because it consists of arrays of bushes such as kooratiya, Tharanga, Maila, Pila , etc, and the trees such as Nabada, Dunuke, Mee, etc. In addition sedges such as Hambupan, Thunhiriya, Gal ehi, etc. and also different kind of climbers such as Kaila, Katukeliya, Bokalawel (IUCN 2015)and grasses abound in these land mass. These florae have an ability to trap sediments and absorb pollutants and negate their toxicity reaching to the tank. Moreover, these strip of trees (Gasgommana) act as a wind barrier and also lower the temperature of the water in the tank.
We in the Department of Agric. Engineering and Soil Science of the Rajarata University have shown the nutrient and some metal retention capabilities of thaulla. We also conducted a research at Ulankulama tank at Maradankadawala.
This study found a higher accumulation of Fe (1819.65 ppm) and Al (1586.75 ppm) with a considerable retention of P (74.80 ppm), Ca (163.79 ppm) and Mg (203.67 ppm) in the tested soil.
?
"Established at present as a multifactorial origin"
?
Another study done in the same thaulla showed the phytoextraction behaviour of two monocot plants. These results suggest that thaulla, can act approximately as an active ?constructed wetland? which efficiently removes pollutants in order to sustain the system.
Scientists have shown the water quality improvement ability of constructed wetland. Since thaulla is submerged with water for about 3 to 5 month during the rainy season, and then drying steadily during the other months, the thaulla and tank water spread area its ecosystem can also be considered as a special wetland.
It has been shown that many species of plants/ trees absorb contaminants such as lead, cadmium, chromium, arsenic, and various radionuclides from soils.
Contaminants in water are reduced or removed by wetland systems by mechanisms including sedimentation, filtration, chemical precipitation and adsorption, microbial interactions and uptake by vegetation.
Ancient people knew that the lifespan of the tank depended on the functions of thaulla.Therefore, entering into this area was customarily prohibited to anybody except the Ayurveda doctor.
However, at present, it is rather difficult to find out the good extent of thaulla in most of the tanks and also conservation of this area is neglected due to overexploitation of the resources and ignorance. This degradation of thaulla area results in lowering the water holding capacity of the tank and impair the water quality.
Kattakaduwa (Interceptor)
This is an elongated murky meadow with turbid water in between the outer toe of a tank bund and paddy field. When halophytes such as mee, kumbuk, lunuwarana, thimbiri, val beli, and vetakeyya are grown in over the rim of the meadow salts on the water is reduced (Tennakoon, 2015).
Scientist have observed the higher electrical conductivity in this area. This observed higher salinity concentration is due to seepage of water from a dead storage area of the tanks where there is a buildup of salinity in most of the tanks. However, this Kattakaduwa area also acts as a downstream wind barrier and helps to protect soil from erosion as the majority of species consists of well-developed root systems. Hence this ecofriendly structure, Kattakaduwa improves the water quality of the command area by removing excess salts, nutrients and sediments.
This command area is the catchment for the next downstream tank in the tank cascade system.
Iswetiya or Potawetiya is an upstream soil ridge made on either side of the tank bund to avoid sediment particles entering from upper land slopes towards the tank.
In addition, Godawala and Kuluwewa were constructed to trap sediments reaching from the ephemeral stream to the tank. Godawala which is found in association with a small tank, is a manmade waterhole.
Whereas Kuluwewa a small tank/pond above large reservoirs trap sediments and provide water for cattle and wild animals which may be a strategy to avoid man-animal conflicts.Construction of these Iswetiya or Potawetiya, Godawala or Kuluwewa ensures the good water quality and combat siltation of the tank.
In addition, during the dry spells with the frequency of 3 to 5 seasons, villages were used to identify the more silted places of the tank bed and arrange shramadana campaign to remove muds (Kattikapeema).
Moreover, the place of the spillway of the tank is generally designed to open to a low rounded rock outcrop area so that erosion is minimized from the spilt water. Hence, the tank water was sustainably used for drinking, bathing, washing and irrigation. Raising the dam or spill was not required as at present to accommodate a sufficient quantity of water for irrigation.
?
"People in the area used to get potable water from the tanks. ?adverse changes that took place to the ecosystem of the tank cascade system and new commercial practices of agriculture have also become reasons?"
In the command area of the tank where paddy was grown, the old natural stream was used as a common drainage line. It was called as Kiul ela and it could remove salt and iron from polluted water and improved the drainage condition of the paddy fields (Dharmasena, 2004).
Because, along with the drainage line (Kiulela), there are tree species such as karanda, mee, mat grass, etc. Those trees are capable of trapping excess nutrients and salts and this shows that the drainage water is purified to a considerable extent even at the command area.
This drainage water subsequently reaches to the next downstream tank through the Wew Ismaththa (closer catchment) and Wew thaulla in the cascade system. Dharma-wardana (2015, 2017) stated that the origin of kidney disease was linked to water of high ionicity damaging the membranes in the tubules and other components of the kidney via the Hofmeister mechanism. Ionicity of water substantially is low in tank water when the water passes through these Kattakaduwa ? Kiwul Ela system. At present, these systems are neglected in some of the tanks that may result in increased salinity.
Fig 05 : Schematic representation of the profile of a small tank and its components ( Produce by the Authors)
The benefit of tank cascade system is that the downstream tank captures the excess water from the tank above. Thus water is not wasted but recycled.
However, this age-old concept has not been continued during the 1950s to 1970s where short-sighted efforts have been increasingly made by the water resource managers.
If all these tanks were in operation (around 15,000), we hope there is no need of excavating groundwater for drinking or even farming.
Use of groundwater for drinking has been one of the causes of CKDu because of its higher ionicity. We hope still there is a possibility to adapt to these tank cascade system and integrate the ancient technology with the novel watershed management techniques so that we could supply quality drinking water to dry and intermediate zone of the country.
Sri Lanka needs a water policy formulation addressing the water quality issues and identifying the tank cascade system as the lifeblood of the dry zone rather than water of trans-basin water diversion system such as the Mahaweli system.
Components of the tanks need to be well delineated and recognized as vital areas in improving the water quality.

Taxation: It?s Class Stupid
	
It is budget season again. For mainstream economists, budgets are mainly about fiscal discipline, and they focus on the impact of state expenditure on the budget deficit and government debt. For international agencies like the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank, it is about whether state expenditure will be cut to address their conditions and interests, including shrinking the role of the state, privatization and free markets. ?
Discussions and debates around the budget tend to focus on state expenditure. Yet, state expenditure is not possible without state revenues, unless the country takes on more debt. Although state revenues depend on taxation, the latter is seldom discussed in relation to the budget, and rarely features in national debates, except when there is a tax increase. Furthermore, taxation in the form of redistribution is at the core of sustaining social welfare, necessary for a decent economic life and to reduce the ever-widening inequalities in the country. ?
?
"Discussions and debates around the budget tend to focus on state expenditure. Yet, state expenditure is not possible without state revenues, unless the country takes on more debt"
Revenue decline
Sri Lanka can be proud of its post-colonial history of state investment in free education, free healthcare and social welfare more broadly, at least until the devastating open economic reforms of 1977. Such levels of investment in social welfare were possible, for the most part, due to decent levels of state revenues in the decades after independence. However, taxation and tax collection centred on trade instituted in the 1930s, did not significantly shift to income, corporate and wealth taxes; this stagnation of the tax base has contributed to the decline in state revenues and undermined social welfare in recent decades.? ?
In ?The Political Economy of Long-Term Revenue Decline in Sri Lanka? (ICTD Working Paper 65, 2017), Mick Moore provides a historically grounded analysis of taxation in Sri Lanka. He shows us that government revenues as a percentage of GDP were on the order of 21% from 1948 to 1990, but declined drastically thereafter with revenues over the last decade much lower at about 13% of GDP. According to Moore, proposed explanations for this sharp fall in taxation during the last quarter century include an archaic revenue collection system, reluctance on the part of successive governments to implement higher levels of taxation given their liberalization orientation, and changes in politics, policies and institutional structures that have led to declining state revenues.? ?
Taking up the latter argument, Moore explains how a combination of political, economic and institutional changes, including electoral pressures co-opted by clientalistic politics, donor aid flows allowing for larger deficits, tax exemption policies, weakening advocacy from the finance ministry for tax collection and reliance on taxes on imports, have all contributed to this decline in state revenues. This dynamic analysis of broader political economic changes are a refreshing entry point for a much needed debate on taxation in Sri Lanka.
?
"Instead of addressing the root causes of declining state revenues, neo-liberal propagandists push for austerity measures, including cutting state services by blaming state expenditure for the budget deficits"
?
Tax burden
The crucial issue in contemporary times is that the decline in state revenues and increasing budget deficits are used as weapons by those advocating economic liberalization and particularly privatization. Instead of addressing the root causes of declining state revenues, neo-liberal propagandists push for austerity measures, including cutting state services by blaming state expenditure for the budget deficits. In reality, state expenditure is on the order of 20% of GDP in Sri Lanka, quite low for a so-called middle income country.? ?
Ideological arguments about the inefficiency of the state sector are deployed to further the agenda of a shrunk state and free market economy. The undermining of free education and healthcare, draw from such an attack on state services. In reality, the private healthcare industry for example is subsidized by the state, by allowing public sector doctors to moonlight in private hospitals and clinics.? ?
When fiscal pressures mount and international donor agencies demand reductions of budget deficits, governments resort to increasing indirect taxes including the VAT. The VAT is a regressive form of taxation, with a flat levy on all consumption without considering incomes and equity, whereby the poorer sections of society pay a much larger fraction of their incomes in taxes.? ?
Following on the IMF Agreement of June 2016, the VAT rate was increased from 11% to 15% in November 2016. As a result, total VAT revenue was 26.6% and domestic VAT revenue was 16.5% of total tax revenue in 2017; the latter alone was more the than total income tax revenue. In 2017, income taxes were 16.4%, domestic consumption taxes were 31.8% and imports based taxes were 49.2% of total tax revenue (Finance Ministry Annual Report 2017).? ?
It is no secret that contrary to the stated positions of successive governments to increase direct taxes, indirect taxes have been well over 80% of state revenues. The continued increase in indirect taxes has shifted the tax burden to the broader public and made a mockery of the idea of progressive taxation and redistribution. ?
?
"It is no secret that contrary to the stated positions of successive governments to increase direct taxes, indirect taxes have been well over 80% of state revenues"
State, class and citizens
Expanding on Moore?s analysis, I would argue that these problems of lopsided taxation, declining state revenues and the undermining of social welfare spending are tied to a central political question. What is the relationship between state, capital and the citizens, or more simply put, how does the government relate to the wealthy classes and the working people?? ?
The political demands in Sri Lanka for social welfare, since the late colonial period, have been in the form of claims on the state for services rather than for redistribution per se. With neo-liberal policies in 1977, calls for state support have been reduced to hand outs, including paltry poverty alleviation schemes, as opposed to redistribution leading to the strengthening social welfare including universal education and healthcare programmes. Today, demands from ordinary working people tend to focus on subsidies and even trade unions only call for piecemeal pay hikes. Sadly, even after the Budget is announced, the spotlight remains on subsidies to farmers, price cuts to food items or salary hikes for state employees. ?
Why are corporate and income taxes of the wealthy sections of the country so low? Why is directly redistributing wealth through taxation hardly discussed? Even Nobel Prize winning mainstream economist Joseph Stiglitz advocated wealth taxes including on property, when he visited Colombo two years ago for the Economic Forum. However, economic debates in Sri Lanka are yet to address class inequalities including those of incomes and wealth. ?
At the height of a recession in the US in 1992, Bill Clinton turned around a major presidential election in his favour with the slogan, ?It?s the Economy Stupid.? Speaking about the economy and jobs in neo-liberal America created a shift in the political debate solidifying that phrase for decades. If we are to go further, and debate the need for redistribution and equality as central tenets of tax policies and budget making in Sri Lanka, we may have to start with the slogan, ?It?s Class Stupid.?????

Treasury to absorb SriLankan liabilities
	
The government decided to create a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) under Treasury to absorb the total liabilities of SriLankan Airlines after writing them off its balance sheets, a Minister said yesterday.
Public Enterprises Development Minister Lakshman Kiriella told Daily Mirror it was a pre-requisite to strike an equity sharing arrangement with an investor to develop the national career. He said the national career should start with a clean balance sheet with no debt burden.
?We had talks with the Finance Ministry a couple of weeks ago and decided to create the Special Purpose Vehicle. It is an entity to transfer the liabilities of the national career,? he said.
The Minister said a lot of investors including foreign airlines had shown interest in investing in Sri Lanka?s national career, but outstanding debt volume, accumulated over a period, had been deterrence.
He said the airlines from the countries such as Japan, China and Germany were keen to partner with Sri Lankan Airlines under an equity sharing arrangement.
?We are contacted by a lot of investors. There are several airlines from China alone. But, the liabilities are a problem,? he said.
Earlier, the Cabinet had granted approval for the government to absorb the total liabilities of the national career amounting to Rs.461 billion. (Kelum Bandara)

Ubiquity University partners with ESOFT to bring soft skills and competency-based education to Sri L
	
Dr. Jim Garrison-Founder and CEO, Ubiquity University, Dr. Dayan Rajapakse - Chairman/Managing Director, ESOFT, Mr. Ravi Jayawardena - Group Chief Executive Officer, Maliban Biscuit Manufactories (Pvt) Ltd and Mr. Dilan Perera - Chief Operating Officer, ESOFT-Colombo
ESOFT and Ubiquity University announced a partnership that will bring soft skills and competency-based education to high-school, undergraduate and post-graduate students across Sri Lanka. By leveraging ESOFT?s expansive network of over 40 centers island wide, and combining its experience in technical skills with Ubiquity?s expertise in holistic education and soft skills development, this partnership will enable Sri Lankan students to develop critical competencies in leadership, critical thinking, creativity, collaboration, emotional intelligence, cross boundary team building, resilience and global thinking. These competencies will give them the complete package of skills they need to succeed in the competitive, ever-changing job market of the day.
Soft competencies are now globally recognized as the leading indicators for successful professional performance and career advancement and are in high demand by leading companies such as Google, IBM, Facebook and more. By offering these learning opportunities to students around Sri Lanka, ESOFT and Ubiquity will imbue young learners with the technical, inter-personal and intra-personal skills they need to align themselves with the needs of the job market and maintain a competitive advantage that will allow them to excel in their professional lives.
Through this partnership, all ESOFT students will have access to Ubiquity?s full range of nano-courses, micro-courses and trimester courses. These courses, built around Ubiquity?s pioneering Integral Learning System, will allow students to experience whole-system education for the first time in Sri Lanka. It will also allow these students to earn globally-accepted credentials for the development of critical soft-skills as they earn competency badges, certificates and degrees.?
Ubiquity will also allow transfer of credits for coursework already completed at ESOFT, including vocational schools, thereby allowing students to ?top-up? their academic progress with Ubiquity courses and move closer towards BA, MA, MBA and PhD qualifications.? ESOFT and Ubiquity have also pledged to collaborate in the development of leadership training programs for O-level students, A-level students and corporate partners.
Jim Garrison, Founder and CEO of Ubiquity University, observes that ?In the United States, Europe and around the world it is increasingly clear to both employers and employees that soft skills matter. Who you are is more important than what you know. How you interact with others is more critical than knowing data. One recent study shows that 93% of US employees consider soft skills as, if not more, important than hard skills. This mandates an educational design that brings High Tech and High Touch together into an interactive holistic approach to learning. This is what ESOFT and Ubiquity have partnered to do in Sri Lanka. It is ground breaking and will reshape learning as we know it.?
Dr. Dayan Rajapakse, Chairman of the ESOFT Group of Companies, states that ?ESOFT?s partnership with Ubiquity is a timely need as many large corporations around the world are now putting a lot of emphasis on soft skills of the workforce that they attract. Being in the strategic management of ESOFT Group I have really felt this need. Studies have shown how well these skills complement other skills and contribute to enhance worker productivity. I?m happy to partner with an expert in this field and I?m sure this will give us a competitive advantage as we will continue to train people with cutting edge technology while building their competencies in soft skills that will be unmatched by others. I?m certain this initiative will not only benefit ESOFT and Ubiquity as business entities, but the youth of the country as well.??
All ESOFT students who engage in Ubiquity courses will also be eligible for a $25,000 award should they choose to participate in Ubiquity?s Global Sustainability Challenge?a unique opportunity to work with peers around the world in pursuit of creative, innovative ways to solve global challenges that center around the UN Sustainable Development Goals.

Unilever Sri Lanka chairman Carl Cruz and United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) Country Director Jorn Sorensen recently handed over a policy action paper for the promotion of public private partnerships for sustainable development to the Secretary to H.E. the President of Sri Lanka, Udaya Seneviratne.
The paper was the direct result of last year?s Unilever-UNGC-UNDP Forum which brought together Sri Lanka?s business leaders across a myriad of industries in the private sector, key personnel from the public sector, and key development partners to work on driving mutually beneficial partnerships towards the achievement of key priorities related to the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
As a signatory of the SDGs in 2015 Sri Lanka has committed to making a sustainable change today for a better tomorrow. However, the scope of the changes, which span the breadth and length of the nation and will ultimately impact every citizen, needed the unprecedented cooperation of both the public and private sector. The Forum in 2017 discussed the best practices for moving these Public-Private Partnerships (PPP) forward and ensuring their long term sustainability. The policy paper highlights the immediate next steps that need to be taken to align project goals to the wider national agenda.
Udaya Seneviratne, Secretary to H.E. the President of Sri Lanka, said, ?It is important to understand that we stand at the precipice of far reaching change and change at that magnitude cannot be achieved by any one entity alone. It needs the cooperation of an entire nation ? both the public and private sectors working in unison towards a common goal. While the government continues to work towards bringing about sustainable development we commend the private sector for taking up the cause as well. I look forward to seeing the steps outlined in this policy paper in action.?
Carl Cruz, Chairman, Unilever Sri Lanka, said, ?The changes required by the SDGs are neither small nor narrow. Therefore, if we are to achieve these goals we must work together to help the nation realize its vision of a brighter future. Only together can we bring long term sustainable change to the nation and help propel its growth. The steps that we as a nation need to take are outlined in the policy paper that we handed over to the President?s Secretary. We look forward to working closely with our partners ? in both the public and private sectors ? to bring about the change Sri Lanka needs.?
Jorn Sorensen, UNDP Sri Lanka Country Director, said, ?Sustainable development is the future and by investing in it now, we are securing Sri Lanka?s place in that future. However, to achieve sustainable development we will need the Government, businesses and development partners to work together towards our collective vision for the nation. The outline for this collaborative framework is laid out in the policy paper that we handed over to the President. UNDP is proud to be a catalyst in convening these stakeholders and helping them unleash their true potential for change.?
The policy paper outlines several projects targeted at specific SDGs. These include project SustainabiliTEA which will target sustainable agriculture. The aim of the project is to ensure that all tea produced in Sri Lanka comply with sustainable agricultural practices by 2020. Partners in the project are Unilever Sri Lanka, Aitken Spence, Dialog Axiata, and Sri Lanka Tea Federation.
Project Grama Shakthi will target the economic inclusion of women by reaching out to directly engage with women in 7000 (50%) villages across the island and provide them with housing, education and encouragement to become entrepreneurs. Partners in the project are the Presidential Secretariat, Ministry of Education, Ministry of Women & Child Affairs, Unilever Sri Lanka, Commercial Bank &MAS.
Project Sunlight will target waste management by converting 5000 retail outlets to solar energy by 2020. Partners in the project are the Ministry of Power and Renewable Energy, Unilever Sri Lanka, Commercial Bank, and Aitken Spence.
This year?s forum, which is set to take place shortly, will tackle four more key areas of national importance thereby scaling for impact and widening the footprint of these PPPs. The four areas are namely conservation of threatened species & sustainable tourism; water management; community empowerment; and chronic kidney disease prevention. Ultimately, within a framework of collaboration, these partnerships will steer Sri Lanka towards a sustainable future.
