FCID quizzes deputy minister over major Ethanol scam
	
The Police Financial Crimes Investigation Division yesterday quizzed Deputy Minister of Plantation Industries Lakshman Wasantha Perera over a major Ethanol smuggling ring that also saw the alleged involvement of a former senior minister in the UPFA government.
The Deputy Minister who arrived at the FCID office yesterday morning was questioned for over two hours after which a statement was recorded.
According to FCID sources the Matale District Parliamentarian was quizzed about a stock of 60, 000 litres of Ethanol imported into the country from 2012 to 2014 by producing forged documents.
The Ethanol had been imported in the guise of being used to manufacture air fresheners but evidence had emerged to show that it had actually been used to produce alcohol.
The FCID had leant that the stock of Ethanol imported into the country had been sent to a leading liquor distillery in the North Western Province belonging to a former Cabinet Minister of the Mahinda Rajapaksa government.
The police had also found that the contraband had been transported to the said distillery from the Colombo Port in lorries belonging to the Cooperative Wholesale Establishment (CWE).
The sources said that they are currently recording statements from the persons involved in what has now been found to be a major Ethanol scam and said they were also trying to ascertain the degree of involvement of the former minister in the scam.
Meanwhile, two sons of the former minister were also summoned by the FCID to record a statement regarding the same scam, the sources said. (Kurulu Koojana Kariyakarawana)

Flood relief distribution: needs attention
	
Even though lorry loads of dry rations, food and other requirements were pouring into the flood affected areas in Kelaniya and other areas in Colombo, people complained that there was no proper ground level mechanism to ensure that they reached to the people who were actually affected and in need of assistance.
People who were displaced by the floods in some areas in Kelaniya, Kelanimulla, Bogahawatte and Angoda alleged that no responsible officer was there in the ground level to monitor the process of providing dry rations by various donors and well-wishes from all parts of the country.
Residents in Kelanimulla and Bogahawatte pointed out that some people who were trapped in unreachable places were unattended while those who were staying by the roadside gained the most of the food and dry rations unreasonably.
Ajith Kumara, a resident of Bogahawatte told us that his house was under water up to the roof and that his wife and child who were trapped there were taken out and sent to his friend's house while his 86-year-old grandmother who was reluctant to leave the house was trapped in the house situated in an unreachable place.
?My house is under water upto the roof. My wife, son and grandmother were staying in the house. I sent my wife and little son to a friend?s house but my grandmother is reluctant to leave. During Wednesday and Thursday, we were helpless without food, water and electricity, and were provided with food by the air force in choppers. There are about 200 families there. Most of them are reluctant to leave the houses despite the hardships. Some of them are staying on roof-tops. We have faced another danger as crocodiles are also moving around, he lamented.
The daily mirror team that visited the flood affected Kelaniya , Kelanimulla, Bogahawatte and Angoda areas were able to witness the hardships that the affected people were undergoing, specially women and children who were left without sanitary facilities and medicine.
Some women who spoke to us said they were badly in need of sanitarywear such as underwear and women?s clothes and medicines for children such as panadol syrup, gripe water etc.
Lieutenant R.W.H. Premasiri of the Sri Lanka infantry regiment who was engaged in humanitarian assistance and rescue operations told us that they were providing every possible assistance to the displaced and they were short of small boats to reach some inner lanes that were inundated.
?There are some places where we cannot reach by normal boats. We need small boats to reach such places,? he said.
We were able to witness the commitment of the security personnel beyond their duty. Most of them had not even changed their uniforms for days.
Lieutenant Premasiri and his team were transporting dry rations and other needs to the affected, by boats.
The people in the area were committed to assist their neighbours who were in distress even though there was no responsible authority to monitor the process.
However, they said, as there was no official to monitor the process, some organized people were taking undue advantage of the lorry loads of food and dry rations donated by well-wishes while some others were left even without basic needs. (Ajith Siriwardana)

President condoles, says programme in place to deal with situation
	
President Maithripala Sirisena expressed his profound grief for the loss of life, the people who went missing and the damage caused to property as a result of the adverse weather conditions prevailing throughout the island.
He extended the concern of the government to all affected citizens, including those who are now confined to temporary shelters.
?I extend my gratitude to the three armed forces and the police, district and divisional secretaries and all government officials for braving this situation and assisting the people in providing them safety and other welfare measures.
To all those who came forward to assist the people affected by this tragedy with so much dedication I would like to offer my heartfelt gratitude. You have earned the praise of all citizens of the country and the manner in which you carried out these tasks deserve special mention,? President said.
He stated that a three-pronged action plan had been put in place by the government in this regard. The first is to provide maximum welfare facilities to the people in distress. Second is to adopt strategies to face a situation in the event of the rains intensifying and the third is when the bad weather ends to construct houses for the displaced, provide their health and sanitation requirements thereafter.
He also stressed that the government is doing its utmost to provide food, sanitation facilities as well as temporary accommodation to all those who are affected by this calamity, and called upon the general public, benefactors of the business community, non-governmental organizations to come forward to provide maximum assistance to those affected. The government is attempting to provide all that is needed at this hour without any shortcomings, but it is apparent that in situations of this nature it cannot avoid criticism being levelled against it by persons with vested interests. However we are doing our best to avoid such criticism.
?I have instructed all responsible authorities to establish units for the disbursement of assistance and grants in all districts that are faced with this situation. These units should work in a systematic manner to have these grants and assistance sent directly to those who need it, thereby negating any room for corruption or any irregularities to take place. A structure is already in place in this regard,"the President said.
He also requested the general public to inform the special unit set up at the Presidential Secretariat on Telephone Number 1919 if any irregularities or any acts of commission are taking place. He also drew the attention of all local government members to give their fullest support to this programme of action undertaken by the government. Already we have requested friendly nations through their diplomats to render assistance by way of housing, health and sanitation facilities to affected families. Some nations have already come forward to offer assistance in this regard. President Sirisena expressed his sincere gratitude to these nations.

Rising water levels may shut down Ambatale
	
Rising sea levels will cause an increase in the water levels in the Kelani Ganga resulting in the shutting down of the new Ambatale water intake, Town Planning and Water Management Minister Rauff Hakeem told Parliament today.
He informed the House that the pump house would have to be shut down if the water level in the Kelani Ganga reaches to 23 feet.
?I can confidently say that the water will not reach the critical 23 feet," said Minister Hakeem, who made a special statement in the House.
"Since of yesterday we have seen a steady decrease of water levels and it had gone down to 19 feet by morning, yesterday," he said.
"Due to the natural phenomenon of the sea level increasing during the two days before poya and two days after poya, while reaching the peak during poya day, we are closely monitoring the high tide that is being reported," he said.
Further the Minister said "Last morning there was a 0.4 metre rise in the sea level. It is reported, tomorrow being the Poya day, it may rise upto 0.5 metres. In such a situation discharge of water from the river could be observed," he said.
However, the minister noted that the water level would not increase upto 23 feet.
Further he said there is no truth in the reports which said the water from the Kelani River had been polluted with oil. (Yohan Perera)
