Asian Alliance changes to Softlogic Life Insurance
	
By Zahara Zuhair
Asian Alliance Insurance PLC, which commenced operations in 2001, announced its corporate name change to Softlogic Life Insurance PLC, with the launch of its brand Softlogic Life.
Noting that they want to change the landscape of insurance in Sri Lanka through innovation, Managing Director Iftikar Ahamed said that they believe that aligning their brand with their parent company, the Softlogic Group, is likely to deliver a whole host of benefits.
Softlogic Life Insurance will encourage customers to empower their lives through better choices in lifestyle, with particular focus on
managing health.
The product includes new health solutions that will offer the much needed care and security to meet customers health-related contingencies. Some of the health management services that will be provided under this insurance are, home visits by doctors, emergency medical assistance, home nursing care, door-step medical tests, home delivery of medicines and drugs and a doctor on call.
He said that they are going to cover three pillars, which are wellness, nutrition and fitness as their proposition
in insurance.
We are going to use technology, new innovations and gadgets in order to do this. For an example, to find out how much exercise you have had and the amount of sleep, nutrition level and calories, etc., he said.
We think we need to step out of traditional insurance. When someone talks about insurance you talk about passing away or dying, we are not interested in that, we want you to live life today and enjoy, he noted.
He said that another side they are looking at is that as Sri Lanka has South Asias fastest ageing population, to provide insurance-based products for them.
He said that in Sri Lanka, penetration in life insurance is a mere. 0.48 percent and the regional average is 1.82 percent which is almost four times in terms of the countrys insurance potential. The company noted that they would continue to service them with innovative products.
Another thing is the app. So lets say you are in hospital, all you have to do is write-up your records and bills and we will tell you instantly how much we will pay on that bill. We will inform the hospital immediately. We have cashless arrangements with 60 hospitals in the country. There is no further requirement to hang around there until your bills are approved,
Ahamed said.
We are also introducing another service. Lets assume its 10.30 in the night, you need medication and you forget to get the medicine at that time and its urgent. Once you life up us on your App, we will be filling that prescription and you will have that prescription served within an hour, he added.
It was noted that there will be no change in ownership of the company and Softlogic Life Insurance PLC will continue to be majority held by Softlogic Capital PLC.

Fitch rates Bank Ceylons proposed subordinated debt up to Rs.8bn AA(lka)(EXP)
	
Fitch Ratings has assigned Bank of Ceylons (BOC; AA+(lka)/Stable) proposed subordinated debentures of up to Rs.8 billion an expected national long-term rating of AA(lka)(EXP).
The debentures, which are to have tenors of five and eight years and carry fixed and floating coupons, are to be listed on the Colombo Stock Exchange.
BOC expects to use the proceeds to expand the loan book, improve its Tier II capital base and reduce asset and liability maturity mismatches.
The final rating is subject to the receipt of final documentation conforming to information already received.
The proposed subordinated debentures are rated one notch below BOCs national long-term rating to reflect the subordination to senior unsecured obligations.
The national long-term rating of BOC reflects Fitchs expectation of extraordinary support from the sovereign.
Fitch expects support for BOC to stem from its high systemic importance, quasi-sovereign status, role as a key lender to the government and full state-ownership.

Fitch Ratings Lanka has assigned Peoples Leasing & Finance PLCs (PLC, AA-(lka)/Stable) senior debentures of up to Rs.8 billion a final National Long-Term Rating of AA-(lka).
The assignment of the final rating follows the receipt of documents conforming to information already received. The final rating is the same as the assigned expected rating on 7 September 2016.
The debentures, which have tenors of three, four and five years and carry fixed-coupons, will be listed on the Colombo Stock Exchange. PLC will use the proceeds to fund loan book growth and reduce maturity mismatches.
The debentures are rated in line with PLCs National Long-Term Rating as they rank equally with claims of the companys other senior unsecured creditors.
PLCs Issuer Default Rating and National Long-Term Rating reflect Fitchs view that PLCs parent, the state-owned and systemically important Peoples Bank (Sri Lanka) (AA+(lka)/Stable) would provide PLC with extraordinary support, if required.
Peoples Banks propensity to support PLC stems from its 75 percent shareholding in PLC, common brand and PLCs position as the banks strategic subsidiary.

Govt. to repeal Export and Import Control Act: PM
	
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, in his pre-budget statement on the status of economy and outlining plans for the next year, said today a new set of investment incentives based on Capital Allowances and low tax regime would be introduced.
In a lengthy statement to the House in conformity with a tradition initiated by him last year, the Prime Minister said the government planned to repeal the Export and Import Control Act and bring in new legislation on the lines of Singapores (a) Regulation of Imports and Exports Act and (b) Strategic Goods Control Act.
The current domestic market enterprises also have a greater role to strengthen the economy  in addition to expected Direct Investments of local and foreign origin. They too can add to export volume. The Government will assist them to connect with the Global Value Chain by introducing a Trade Adjustment Package which will include Capital Allowance for new equipment, he said.
We can double our personal income levels by 2025 if we set in motion a growth rate of 7% per annum. This rate was achieved in the aftermath of the war in 2009 but the momentum brought on as a dividend of peace did not last,
He said the garment industry would see a revival when GSP+ returned.
Agricultural exports have declined as a result of prices for tea and rubber slowing down. It must be noted that in the plantations sector, some of the companies are being run well while others not so. The Government plans to restructure the regional plantations companies by infusing new capital and introducing efficient enterprises, he said.
Referring to the debt burden, he said the government had decided to swap debt for equity, and the Hambantota port and Mattala airport be run as PPP ventures. He outlined the creating of a Megapolis Development Authority to develop the terrain of the Western Megapolis and urban area of over 8  million people.
The second North-Eastern development corridor will connect the Eastern Province and the North Central Province to Jaffna linking the Trincomalee Port to the Rajarata. The completion of the Moragahakanda and the Malwatu Oya reservoirs will create new vistas for the country and will result in the region gaining more land for agriculture. It will further result in the historic cities of Polonnaruwa and Anuradhapura emerging as modern urban centres. Trincomalee will be urbanized and transformed into a world-class Port City, he said.(Yohan Perera)

The Joint Opposition today urged the government to reverse the decision to suspend the broadcasting license of Carlton Sports Network (CSN) stating that suspension of the licence would set a dangerous precedent.
Joint Opposition group leader Dinesh Gunawardane, who made a statement in Parliament with regard to the matter, said the licence of CSN had been suspended on the grounds that it was working towards the interests of a political party.
"The CSN does not work towards the interests of a political party and we urge the government to reverse this decision, he said.
Media Minister Gayantha Karunatilleke in response ruled out the retracting the suspension as the TV Channel had not produced financial statements, violating the conditions on which the licence was given.
He said the channel had not noticed the authorities of the change of address as per the conditions as well.
Minister of Finance Ravi Karunanayake, who joined in the cross talk, said the channel had defaulted payments of duties as well. (Yohan Perera)

Deputy Minister of Cultural Affairs and Wayamba Development Palitha Thewarappurma, who responded to an oral question raised by MP Buddhika Pathirana in the House said there was a legal barrier to do way with the proclamation.
There is a legal barrier which is going to be complicated as the lands recovered from these persons have to be released to their descendants. However, he said the government was ready to remove the proclamation if any descendants came forward with the appeal.
Further the Deputy Minister said the Ministry of Justice had to deal with it as a legal matter.
There is no need to create any issue as these persons, including Keppitpola Disawe are considered national heroes now," he said. (Yohan Perera)

Three Indians nabbed with heroin
	
The Sri Lankan Navy today arrested three Indian nationals who had attempted to smuggle in two kilogrammes of heroin in a boat in the seas off Arippu in Mannar.
The arrest came a week after three Navy Ratings were assaulted by a group of villagers of the same town when a team of Navy intelligence officers attached to the Silawathurai Navy Camp in Mannar arrived in the Arippu area to check on information received by them about Kerala Ganja was being smuggled into the country in boats that came by sea using this area as an entry point.
In yesterday's detection naval personnel attached to SLNS Barana located in Mullikulam in the North Western Naval Command arrested the suspects when they tried to smuggle the drugs after entering the country in the guise of being local fishermen, Navy spokesman Akram Alavi explained.
The Indian fishermen were arrested during a special operation in the area conducted by the navy.
Captain Alavi said they were trying to find out whether there was a connection between the assault incident and the three arrests which were made today.
It was uncertain whether there was a conspiracy to remove the navy from the area so that the racketeers can smuggle in drugs easily to the country, he said.
The persons who were arrested and the haul of heroin would be handed over to the Police Narcotics Bureau (PNB) for onward investigations.(Darshana Sanjeewa)

Unfair to level war crime allegations: Gen. Gerry de Silva
	
Former Army Commander, Retired General Gerry de Silva yesterday said that it was unfair to level war crime allegations against Sri Lankan forces and having inquiries into them, without having a proper idea on what really took place in the humanitarian mission and finding out both sides of the story.
Addressing a media briefing held to brief the launch of his book tiled War Heroes-Killed in Action, he said those who were responsible for the amount of casualties caused in the Second World War, were now propagating the theory on war crimes and they were still involved in wars.
When you are fighting a war, you have to react to enemys action immediately which occupies in your mind at that time. The soldiers are fighting for their country by sacrificing their lives to upgrade the unity and integrity of the country. And the LTTE was known to be the most ruthless militant organization in the world. The controversy arises in the final battle field Nanthikadal.
Then, the LTTE tried to make civilians as human shield to defend themselves. The fight was really tough because at one hand our war heroes had to fight with the terrorists and on the other hand they had a humanitarian mission to save the civilians as much as possible, the one time Sri Lankan High Commissioner to Pakistan explained.
He said he expected to give deep insights on the dedication, suffering, tribulations and commitments made by Sri Lankan gallant soldiers for the sake of the country.
More than twenty war heroes, who were honored with Parama Weera Vibhushana (PWV) Award for gallantry in battle for their heroic actions including Hasalaka Hero Corporal Kularatne, who died in saving the Elephant Pass Camp in 1991, the late Lieutenant Generals Denzil Kobbekaduwa and Vijaya Wimalaratne, who died from a landmine explosion in 1992 are featured in the book titled War Heroes-Killed in Action.
The book launch will be held on October 28 at the BMICH under the patronage of former President and Kurunegala District MP Mahinda Rajapaksa and former Defence Secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa. (Piyumi Fonseka)

Union Bank 3Q net up 74% to Rs.133mn
	
Union Bank of Colombo PLC saw its net profits for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 (3Q16) rising as much as 74 percent to Rs.133.2 million from a year ago, on the back of modest growth seen in the banks loan book, but the margins came under further pressure as interest rates rose, the interim financial accounts released to the Colombo Stock Exchange showed.
The earnings per share rose to 12 cents from 7 cents. The banks share closed 10 cents or 0.62 percent lower at Rs.16.10 during yesterdays trading.
The bank on a standalone basis saw its gross loans and advances rising 30 percent or Rs.12.3 billion during the 9 months to Rs.53 billionlittle under Rs.1.4 billion disbursements a month. But the banks net interest margin came further under pressure as it fell under 3.0 percent to 2.79 percent from 3.37 percent at the beginning of the financial year.
The deposits grew by 32 percent or Rs.11.9 billion while the low cost, current and savings accounts (CASA) ratio stood little under 24 percent.
The industry average hovers around 37 percent, which is also down from around 42 percent at the beginning of the year as people shifted from low interest earning savings accounts to high yielding fixed deposits when the market interest rates rose.
But this put pressure on the margins of the banking sector as the sector margins also came down to around 3.5 percent by the end of the first eight months, hence the banks were fighting to maintain the bottom-line by re-pricing its assets
and liabilities. 
Union Banks net interest income however grew 34 percent Year-on-Year (YoY) to Rs.806.2 million. But the net fee and commission income, which generally cushions the narrowing margins, dropped 4 percent you to Rs.106.1 million. 
The bank had gains from the trading from the investments and foreign exchange better than what it enjoyed during the same quarter last year.
The bank has zero exposure to equity investments. For the nine months ended September 30, the bank posted a net profit of Rs.367.8 million, up 154 percent YoY. The earnings per share rose to 34 cents from 13 cents.
Meanwhile, the banks provisions made against the possible bad loans in respect of individual customers saw an increase of 54 percent YoY to Rs.45.8 million but the asset quality improved as the gross non-performing loans ratio dropped to 2.73 percent from 3.55 percent at the end of 2015. 
The bank which has the backing of US-based Culture Financial Holdings Limited had its Tier I and Tier II capital adequacy ratios at 23.03 percent and 22.38 percent, respectively, by the end of September, well above the minimum requirements of 5 percent and 10 percent each. Culture Financial holds 70 percent stake in the bank.
The Central Bank along with the Finance Ministry are said to be contemplating to further increase the minimum core capital of licensed commercial banks to Rs.20 billion from the current Rs.10 billion. Such a move will nothing but force some of the small and mid-sized banks to merge with other well capitalized banks.

Asoka De Silva appointed Deputy Chairman

Meanwhile, Union Bank of Colombo PLC yesterday announced the appointment of the experienced banker Asoka De Silva as its Deputy Chairman to fill the void made by the retirement of Alex Lovell in September after completing a 9-year stint on the board. 
De Silva has served as the Deputy Chairman of Union Bank previously during the period of December 2008  December 2010 and again during May 2012 to November 2014 and has been serving on the board as senior director/ independent non-executive director from 2009. De Silva carries over 35 years of experience in the banking industry and has served as the Chief Executive Officer/General manager of Peoples Bank.
He holds a bachelors degree with honors from the University of Ceylon, and is a Fellow of the Certified Institute of Professional Management, (FCPM)
Sri Lanka.
De Silva, who was awarded a Honorary Fellowship from the Institute of Bankers Sri Lanka, in recognition of his contribution and leadership provided in restructuring and strengthening the Peoples Bank, also holds a Management Development Certificate awarded by the Post Graduate Institute of Management, University of Sri Jayewardenepura as well as Project Analysis and Project Management Certificates awarded by the Arthur D.

Wiped out and it's all our fault
	
Humans have wiped out so many animals that the planet is on the verge of the first mass extinction since the age of the dinosaurs, conservationists have warned.
By the end of the decade, seven out of every ten of the worlds mammals, fish, amphibians, reptiles and birds will have been wiped out, according to the biggest ever report into extinction.
Some of the most threatened species include African elephants, tigers, mountain gorillas and giant pandas, said the report by the WWF and the Zoological Society of London (ZSL).
Its grim findings were described as a wake-up call to help save Earths remaining animals  before it is too late.
The study assessed 14,152 populations of mammals, birds, fish, amphibians and reptiles.
Numbers fell by 58 per cent between 1970 and 2012  and are dropping by around 2 per cent every year, with no sign of any slowdown.
By 2020, populations of vertebrate species could have fallen by 67 per cent over the 50-year period unless action is taken to reverse the damaging impacts of mankind, the Living Planet report found.
These include poaching, farming, over-fishing, deforestation, climate change, the ditching of waste plastic, chemical and air pollution  behaviours that are affecting humans too.
Mike Barrett, director of science and policy at WWF-UK, said: For the first time since the demise of the dinosaurs ... we face a global mass extinction of wildlife.
We ignore the decline of other species at our peril  for they are the barometer that reveals our impact on the world that sustains us.
Humanitys misuse of natural resources is threatening habitats, pushing irreplaceable species to the brink and threatening the stability of our climate.
But he added: We know how to stop this. It requires governments, businesses and citizens to rethink how we produce, consume, measure success and value the natural environment.
The African elephant population has fallen by 111,000 in the past decade, mainly down to poaching, with just 415,000 left.
Other animals are even more rare. There are now just 3,900 tigers in the world and 1,864 giant pandas.
Shockingly the numbers of one of the most at risk species, the Amur leopard, are down to just 70.
Overall, terrestrial species have seen populations drop by 38 per cent between 1970 and 2012. Freshwater species fared even worse, falling by 81 per cent.
For marine creatures  based on 6,170 populations of 1,353 species of fish, birds, mammals and reptiles  the report found a 36 per cent decline.
The worst years were between 1970 and 1980, however the decline has been stabilised thanks to efforts to stop overfishing.
On a positive note, animal species living in African grasslands have increased slightly since 2004, thanks to conservation efforts.
The report also highlights the success of habitat protection and strict hunting controls in Europe.
Professor Ken Norris, director of science at ZSL, said: Human behaviour continues to drive the decline of wildlife populations globally, with particular impact on freshwater habitats.
However, these are declines  they are not yet extinctions  and this should be a wake-up call to marshal efforts to promote the recovery of these populations.
