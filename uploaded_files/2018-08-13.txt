Activities of 'Ava' group: Police launch hotline number
	
The police in Jaffna have introduced a special telephone number ?076-6093030? to complain on activities of the ?Ava? group and launched a campaign to create awareness among the general public against group whose activities had created a fear psychosis among the people in the North.
This had been done by sending police officers in groups to street corners armed with leaflets that were distributed among the people in which they explained the methods they were using to combat the activities of the group while also requesting the help of the public in this regard.
The move, spearheaded by Jaffna District DIG Palitha Fernando, came about as a result of a statement made recently by the Northern Chief Minister C.V Wigneswaran where he said the people in the north were afraid to help the police in their efforts to combat the 'Ava' group as they suspected that the security forces were working in cahoots with the group and felt that their efforts would be futile.
The police believe that the leaflet campaign would help to allay the fears of the Jaffna population and enable them to come forward to help them combat the illegal activities of the 'Ava' group and return civil administration in the north to normalcy. (Romesh Madushanka)

Buying expensive chairs 'simple' for cash rich WPC: Chief Minister
	
Chief Minister Isura Devapriya said it was nothing out of the ordinary for a rich governing body like the Western Provincial Council to import chairs for the use of provincial legislators at a cost of Rs. 640,000 each.
He however reiterated that the decision to import these chairs at such a cost was not his alone. He was addressing the electoral organization meeting of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) in Chilaw which was initially scheduled to be conducted at the Chilaw Urban Council premises.
Yet, the UNP-controlled Urban Council did not grant permission for it. Finally, it was held at the SLFP office in Chilaw. ?Ours is a provincial council that is housed in a modern 15-storey building. It has modern facilities. If you ascend to the top floor of the building you will be able to see just how affluent our province is,? he said.(Lalith Nawaratne)

## Title: Geo Politics of Energy and  Sri Lanka?s  energy security
## Section: Opinion

Geo Politics of Energy and  Sri Lanka?s  energy security
	
?
ri Lanka?s energy demand has seen significant increases in the last decade, by 2020 it is predicted that the demand will be almost double from where it was at 2010. While there is a serious rise in the domestic energy demand in the last decade so has been the serious transformation of the national, regional and global energy security landscape.??
Sri Lanka is currently reeling from industrial strike actions in multiple sectors by trade unions and political party affiliates adding chaos to an already brittle cohabitation government. With fuel and gas prices to rise in global markets mirroring a set of sanctions imposed by the United States on Iran, Sri Lanka may see another spike in its energy market leading to an overall increase in consumer goods.? ?
This article attempts to outline the security landscape that Sri Lanka is part of and the energy security challenges that rise mainly from and intense geo political rivalry that surrounds us. The country is badly in need of an energy security policy and mid to long term strategy of securing our energy security. Ads energy security is a primary national security pillar and should be part of our overall foreign policy and security policy.??
Energy Security environment??
Prior to examining the energy security environment it is important to briefly understand the global security environment which has a direct impact on energy security. The global governance architectures have weakened significantly over the last decade. United States which was the pivot for global security and economic stability is gradually changing under Trump administration. America has sought to reduce its multilateral engagements and commitments.? ?
Thus bi lateral approaches are preferred over institutional arrangements such as the World Trade Organization (WTO) regime. This has set a global precedent, it is a good starting point to understand why Sri Lanka is aggressively pursuing bi lateral free trade agreements with countries like India and Singapore in this context??
With all international efforts there is an incremental surge in renewable energy sources and technological investment yet, despite all these last three decades has witnessed global coal consumption double from its base levels of the 90s. Bulk of that rise has been tied to the geo political rise of Asia led by growth in China.??
China despite its efforts to diversify its energy sector, still accounts for nearly 80% of coal usage for electricity generation and is the largest oil importer from Middle East. China imports 60% of its oil from foreign sources and out of that nearly 70% amount for oil purchased from Middle Eastern suppliers.??
India meanwhile is pursuing actively to achieve complete electrification by 2022, thus both for India and China access to energy resources will be a key plank in their geo political strategy. This column has previously addressed the competing geo strategic policies of both these countries especially with China?s Belt and Road initiative (BRI) which is creating a network of ports, cities and road networks that connects china across land and maritime routes.??
While these strategic policies and projects, reflect economic and military interests of rising China and India, they also underpin the concerted efforts to create a secure supply chain of uninterrupted energy flows both in to China and India. This access will play a crucial role in achieving sustainable growth for both countries and lifting people out of poverty which remains a serious challenge.??
Energy geo politics at work??
While Indo-Pacific is securitizing along the lines of energy security, the demand Asian countries are generating will further increase the political power properties of energy suppliers and exporters. These suppliers will display unilateral tendencies when it comes to global political processes.??
Already Saudi Arabia has suddenly cut diplomatic ties with Canada last week, Saudi Arabia has got involved in a trade war and diplomatic isolation of Qatar. United States and China both remain silent on the recent diplomatic row as Saudi Arabia is a prime Petro state that has strategic interests of both United States and China intertwined.? ?
Contemporary, Russia and Iran are two examples of energy regimes that managed to navigate and influence global political outcomes and be entrenched in Middle Eastern and Eurasian geo politics because of their oil and gas resources that have a larger clientele.??
America?s energy strategy??
Trump administration has achieved a chaotic but from the administration?s perspective a successful strategy, where no country despite its previous standing has an idea where USA stands with it currently. In the context of energy which was a crucial pillar of US foreign policy throughout last 60 years is transforming. The United States foreign policy towards Middle East was purely driven by its interest to acquire, access and maintain stranglehold of oil and gas supplies.??
The Carter Doctrine is a classic example for this, which came in the aftermath of the Iranian revolution, where it clearly mentioned the United States would use its military force to intervene in any conflict situation it deemed would be harming its strategic interests, which in other words was the protection of supply chain and the oil refineries for a stable oil supply.??
?
"Prior to examining the energy security environment, it is important to briefly understand the global security environment which has a direct impact on energy security"
Introducing the policy President Carter went on record to say, ?Let our position be absolutely clear: An attempt by an outside force to gain control of the Persian Gulf region will be regarded as an assault on the vital interests of the United States, and such an assault will be repelled by any means necessary, including military force?.? ?
Trump administration is currently embroiled in a surging trade war with China, The United States last year alone suffered a bi lateral trade deficit of nearly $380 billion dollars with China. As the trade war was looming China attempted to minimize the probability by pledging to buy more oil and gas supplies from the United States.??
Even in the present context if one revisits the trade figures and volume in energy commodities exported to China from the United States amounted to a staggering $ 9 billion. The current Secretary of the US treasury Steven Mnuchin has proclaimed, that they are looking to increasing exports of energy commodities to China to the value of $50 billion in the coming years.? ?
What is important to grasp from these observations are two things, the United States security policy may be less coherent, more arbitrary under Trump and yet United States has achieved a significant Oil independence from its former suppliers, thus endowing them the ability to start trade wars, impose trade embargoes such as the ones on Russia, Venezuela, North Korea and more importantly Iran.??
?
Implications on Sri Lanka??
Geo politics of energy focuses on assessing the impact of energy flows on the power and influence of nations. The primary focus has been on oil and more recently gas flows to global locations from the point of origin. Thus what actually materializes as part of the geo political energy strategy is the process of securing, safeguarding energy supplies, prevent adversaries from accessing and preferably maintain a dominance over the supply chain.??
From a Sri Lankan perspective we have multiple challenges, primary challenge being the inability to articulate an energy security policy and secondly to intelligently navigate the intense energy competition that is taking place in the Indian Ocean. Our geographic location is mainly strategic because of the energy flows that are increasing in volume in our ocean system.??
We are right in the middle of these transit routes we still do not have sufficient storage facilities for oil with the growing demand, we have no real electrification plan, we have committed to international protocols on renewable energy yet our national grid which is dominated by technocrats are gunning to expand coal powered generation facilities. Thus instead of achieving a lesser carbon foot print our reliance on fossil fuels may lead us to be more than 80% reliant on Coal within the next decade.? ?
Surrounded by Geo political competition and a policy apparatus that cannot escape the fossil fuel lobbies, Sri Lanka?s energy security is hugely vulnerable for foreign influence, no matter how much we enhance our security, how much we spend on modernizing our defence establishment a weak energy governance leads to massive national security vulnerabilities, and we already are running on emergency power and backups do not last forever.??

I will never enter politics: Sanga
	
Former star cricketer Kumar Sangakkara confirmed that he will never enter politics despite varying opinions and speculations from both public and media on his imminent entry into politics as a possible candidate for the presidential election in 2020.
Posting a statement on his facebook, Sangakkara said politics and public service was a very serious responsibility and that public duty should always be served with accountability and integrity holding sacrosanct the public trust.
Full Statement:
I would like to put to rest speculation and rumour once and for all, confirming that I do not harbour any ambitions for political office. I never have, and, with enormous certainty, I can say I never will.
I have read with a sense of concern reports of my imminent entry into politics in Sri Lanka as a possible candidate for the presidential election in 2020.
I was also made aware of varying opinions and speculations on this from both members of the public and media. I have, by what I hear and read, been touted as a suitable candidate by some while that others have questioned my credibility and character. While respectfully appreciating the varying diverse opinions made public, I would like to put to rest speculation and rumour once and for all, confirming that I do not harbour any ambitions for political office. I never have, and, with enormous certainty, I can say I never will.
I believe that politics and public service is a very serious responsibility. Public duty should always be served with accountability and integrity holding sacrosanct the public trust. I have the greatest respect for those public servants, whether elected or appointed, who are motivated by good and honourable intentions and are therefore steadfastly committed to the betterment of our country.
While I have no political ambitions, I do hope that we Sri Lankans have the patience and foresight to not only vote the best-suited and most-qualified persons into public office, but also thereafter retain patience as positive social and economic change will not be achieved overnight. I also hope that we have the strength to continuously agitate and demand integrity, accountability, transparency and respect from our elected politicians, ensuring they fully appreciate and understand they that are entrusted with our will to be exercised with responsibility in a manner that benefits all in our society equally.
Post cricket, my plan is, first and foremost, to focus on my family after many years of sacrifice on their part while I was away playing cricket around the world. I am also looking forward to the challenge of developing a second post-playing career in an exciting new phase of my life. Finally, I wish to continue to work with existing charitable partners and friends striving to help various disadvantaged sections of our community. I am forever inspired by the selfless and passionate leaders and volunteers driving these charitable organisations forward and I will try my hardest to support their wonderful efforts in meaningful and useful ways.

If Speaker Karu Jayasuriya constantly refused to recognize the Joint Opposition (JO) as the Main Opposition in Parliament and MP Dinesh Gunawardane as Opposition Leader, the JO would stop recognizing him as the Speaker, MP Udaya Gammanpila said today.
Addressing the weekly news briefing of the Pivithuru Hela Urumaya, the MP said that all points why the Opposition Leader Post should not be given to him had been proved wrong with evidence.
?We have a strong case in our favour. But still, the Speaker refuses to recognize us, since he has been advised to do so,? Gammanpila said.
?The Speaker seeks approval of the Prime Minister before making a decision. If he is not ready to recognize us, we will have to in turn stop recognizing his position. We can stop addressing him as Honourable Speaker or stand up when he enters Parliament. We can even disobey his orders,? he said.
He said they would make a decision on their next move in the struggle to get them the Opposition Leader Post, at the party leaders? meeting, which is to be held tomorrow.
A decision whether to be independent of the United People?s Freedom Alliance (UPFA) would be taken at the meeting, he said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

TEL AVIV REUTERS Aug 11? ?
Thousands of protesters rallied in Tel Aviv on Saturday against Israel?s new law declaring it the nation-state of the Jewish people, legislation that has angered the country?s Arab minority and drawn criticism abroad.? ?
?Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has defended the law, which says only Jews have the right of self-determination in the country and downgrades Arabic from an official language, saying it is necessary in order to fend off Palestinian challenges to Jewish self-determination.? ?
?The protesters, mostly Israeli Arabs, waved Palestinian flags and held up signs that read ?equality? in Arabic?and Hebrew.? ?
??The law legitimizes racism,? said Laila al-Sana, 19, from a Bedouin village in Israel?s southern Negev desert. ?It?s very important to show we are here, to resist,? she said.? ?
?Israel?s Arab population comprises mainly descendants of the Palestinians who remained on their land after the 1948 war at the time of the creation of the modern state of Israel. Hundreds of thousands were forced to leave their homes or fled.? ?
?Many of Israel?s Arab citizens also identify as Palestinian. They make up about a fifth of the state?s 9 million people. Israeli law grants them full equal rights, but many say they face discrimination and are treated as second-class citizens.? ?
??When I heard about the law I felt I should defend my hometown, our land, the land of my ancestors,? said 68-year-old Sheikha Dabbah at the rally.??

## Title: Jaffna uniquely positioned for dual-hub IT strategy: STAX

Jaffna uniquely positioned for dual-hub IT strategy: STAX
	
?
<U+200B><U+200B><U+200B>Dual-IT hub to be centered around outsourced services and start-up ecosystem?
	Need for a catalytic IT movement and a clear sense of the challenges ahead
Sri Lanka?s leading management consulting firm, STAX, recently launched a research report outlining a dual-hub IT strategy for Jaffna. In collaboration with Market Development Facility (MDF), STAX released this report with a view to fostering the region?s substantial potential for IT-related services in line with the national drive to develop a globally-competitive IT industry in Sri Lanka.
?
Earlier this year, the Government unveiled its plans for Island of Ingenuity (IOI), a LKR 300M investment in the ICT/BPM sector. By 2022, Sri Lanka?s IT/BPM sector is expected to reach $5B in revenue, create 200,000 direct jobs and encompass 1,000 start-ups. STAX?s report highlights that Jaffna is uniquely positioned to capitalize on the sector?s growing momentum, ultimately expanding its own contribution to the sector and the wider national economy.?
?
?Among the noteworthy attributes, we observe a positive and entrepreneurial attitude among the Jaffna communities, who also retain a strong connection to the Sri Lankan diaspora ? which could lead to opportunities for investment and knowledge transfer. The region also maintains a high literacy rate while already possessing the necessary ICT infrastructure and a range of opportunities for IT education,? the report noted.
?
Specifically, the report called for the dual-hub strategy to be centered on the development of an Outsourced IT Hub together with the establishment of a Start-up Hub?both of which could be concurrently fostered while delivering returns along different timelines.
?
The Outsourced Hub would involve relatively low-risk activities capable of garnering quick returns in employment, productivity, revenue and IT skilling. Initially, the report envisioned its implementation within the format of a 1,000-person managed services operation that matches local talent to outsourced demand with a gradual focus on upscaling to accommodate new market opportunities.?
?When considering the implementation of this hub, there are at least three potential avenues through which a Managed Services operation in Jaffna can carve a niche for itself in IT/BPO outsourcing, both globally and island-wide: Quality Assurance, Tamil Call Centers and KPO for Accounting Services,? the report added.
?
Comparatively, STAX envisions the Jaffna Start-up Hub as providing greater long-term returns for the region and the national economy, initially focusing on the development of complex and strategic areas of expertise in specific innovations and creating a strong network of IP skills that would shift the focus from importing foreign technology to encouraging and embracing homegrown innovation.
?
The report advocated a combination of traditional and creative startup strategies. While the traditional start-ups could focus on specialized web and app-based development and search engine optimization, the creative start-ups could be oriented around prevailing primary industries in the North ? including agriculture, farming, fisheries, tourism and health ? in addition to catering to industries of necessity through products like smart street lighting, waste management, health, travel and education related apps.?
?
?The viability of this strategy is already borne out in the organic maneuvers of prominent Sri Lankan IT start-up accelerators like Yarl IT Hub and NCIT and IT companies like WS02, Microimage and InfoMate. The current challenge, however, is that many such forward-thinking players operate in isolation or do not benefit from adequate access to resources.Through the formal inclusion of these organic activities in a dedicated strategy for Jaffna, the goal is to build momentum and focus in terms of investment and activity being channeled into this space, whether via global or local investors,? the report stated.?
?
The recommendations of the report are informed by a detailed assessment of the overall IT industry in Jaffna and the broader North?including over 100+ conversations across industry experts, national IT enablers, IT accelerators, private sector companies, local government, diaspora members, Jaffna-based employees and universities and schools.
?
For interested investors and stakeholders, there is a clear call to action. The first order of business is to conduct an evaluation of the financial and technical feasibility of developing a Managed Services operation for the Outsourced Hub. Subsequently, there is a need to secure smart capital for this effort, which will include crafting a compelling story when pitching to relevant investors.
?
As STAX?s Managing Director Ruwindhu Peiris argued ?Global success stories like Malaysia?s Cyberjaya make it clear that digital hubsare the product of a catalytic movement where investors and digitalcompanies grow to a critical mass. For this to happen, all keystakeholders need to come together in a cohesive move. Otherwise, there?s only dispersion.??
?
In essence, local ITeducation providers need to develop industry-ready graduates.Colombo-based IT companies need to move past perceptions andseriously investigate the viability of setting up in the North. Membersof the diaspora need to be engaged to create targeted flows offunding and technology transfer. Northern start-up accelerators needto cultivate the funds and partnerships necessary to foster newentrants. The Government needs to collaborate with externalfunding agencies, private-sector players, non-profit organizationsand other investors to further develop the infrastructure andincentives for a digital hub.
?
Above all, the movement needs to be communicated to the masses. In that sense, this report comes at a critical juncture. As Mano Sekaram, CEO and Co-Founder of 99X Technology pointed out, ?For a long time, the biggest drawback we?ve faced as investors and stakeholders is the absence of a bankable document to promote Jaffna as an IT hub - this report is a step in the right direction and an important conversation starter.?
?
STAX, Sri Lanka?s leading management consulting firm, has its headquarters in Boston, and branch offices across Chicago, New York, Colombo and Singapore. With a rich client base comprising 30+ local conglomerates and family businesses, 15 of the top 20 global investors and 25+ Fortune 500 companies, Stax prides itself on being a full service consulting firm?from strategy to implementation.

JVP complains to AG
	
The Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) today requested the Auditor General in writing to suspend all payments made to House Leaders, the Opposition Leaders the Chief Government Whips and the Chief Opposition Whips at provincial councils including the Western Provincial Council on the basis that they were illegal posts.
The letter signed by a group of JVP provincial councillors including Lakshman Nipunaarachchi, Sunil Watagala, Wasantha Samarasinghe, Nandana Pathmakumara and Sarath Pathirana handed over to the AG said only the Chairman and the Deputy Chairman were acceptable under the Constitution and the Provincial Councils Act.
They said neither the Constitution nor the Provincial Councils Act had provisions to maintain these posts in the Provincial Councils and asked the AG on what basis were the payments and privileges audited.
Mr. Nipunaarachchi said millions of public funds were spent to provide vehicles, staff and office space for these illegal posts.
?We protested against this move at provincial council meetings. If these positions have been there for a long time as claimed by some, we have no objection for keeping those positions traditionally but we are against spending public funds to maintain them,? he said.
Mr. Nipunaarachchi said they requested the AG to conduct an audit on the public funds spent so far and take action to recover the funds while suspending the funds on these illegal posts. (By Ajith Siriwardana)

$39 million in Foreign Military Financing for Sri Lanka
	
The U.S. Department of State announced today that it would provide approximately $39 million in Foreign Military Financing for Sri Lanka, pending Congressional approval. ?
??We look forward to discussing with the Government of Sri Lanka how this contribution can support our Bay of Bengal initiative and Sri Lanka?s humanitarian assistance and disaster response priorities?, it said in a statement.
?The Secretary traveled to Indonesia, Singapore, and Malaysia last week for bilateral and multilateral meetings to advance the security of the United States and the region, and to underscore our support for a rules-based order, reaffirm our commitment to friends and allies, and demonstrate the robust engagement in the Indo-Pacific.? In Singapore the Secretary outlined the security pillar of the administration?s Indo-Pacific strategy and announced nearly $300 million in additional funding intended for South and Southeast Asia.? We?ve gotten a lot of questions about this, so I just wanted to highlight some of what is involved in that program.? There?s been a lot of interest in this,? U.S. Department of State Spokesperson Heather Nauert said.
The funding represents a significant investment in our security relationships with Bangladesh, Indonesia, Mongolia, Nepal, the Pacific islands, the Philippines, Sri Lanka, Vietnam, and others.? The investment focuses on four key areas that are critical to ensuring a free, open, and rules-based order in the Indo-Pacific region.? This includes maritime security, humanitarian assistance, and disaster response, also peacekeeping capabilities and countering transnational crime.? As part of the maritime security theme, we launched the Bay of Bengal Initiative to help enhance the capacity of civilian and military maritime actors in this vital region, which is home to important sea lanes linking the Indian Ocean to East Asia,?

55 MPs, mostly Govt. receive Rs. 200, 000 transport allowance
	
Fifty-five legislators, mostly belonging to the ruling party, assigned to monitor the development projects, are given Rs. 200, 000 each a month as transport allowance, it is learnt.
Joint Opposition MP Gamini Lokuge said he had obtained the name list of these MPs by making a submission under the Right to Information Act.
Mr Lokuge had made his submission on May 28, 2018, seeking details in this regard.
Information Officer of the Land and Parliamentary Affairs Ministry L. B. S. B. Dayaratne had responded to Mr Lokuge on June 20, 2018.
The transport allowance is paid in accordance with a Cabinet decision taken on June 21, 2016. Afterwards, the Land and Parliamentary Affairs Ministry had taken the initiative to pay this allowance upon receipt of letters from President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.
Joint Opposition MP Kanchana Wijesekara also brought this to the notice of Parliament last week.
Asked about this, Land and Parliamentary Affairs Minister Gayantha Karunatilake confirmed the payment of such an allowance to these MPs.
The Minister said these MPs had been assigned positions at the Development Coordinating Committees at district and divisional levels.
?They have been assigned to monitor the implementation of the government?s development projects and activities. It is nothing new.

NASA launches probe into Sun?s scorching atmosphere
	
?
?REUTERS Aug 12? ?
NASA launched a space probe early Sunday that will go closer to the Sun than any spacecraft before, the agency announced.? ?
?The craft will endure extreme heat while zooming through the solar corona to study the Sun?s outer atmosphere that gives rise to the solar winds. The Parker Solar Probe, a spacecraft the size of a small car, launched from Cape Canaveral in Florida about 3:30 a.m.? Sunday, on a seven-year mission. It is set to fly into the Sun?s corona within 3.8 million miles (6.1 million km) of the solar surface, seven times closer than any other spacecraft.? NASA hopes the findings will enable scientists to forecast changes in Earth?s space environment.? ?
?The probe, named after American solar astrophysicist Eugene Newman Parker, will have to survive difficult heat and radiation conditions. It has been outfitted with a heat shield designed to keep its instruments at a tolerable 85 degrees Fahrenheit (29 degrees Celsius) even as the spacecraft faces temperatures reaching nearly 2,500 degrees Fahrenheit (1,370 degrees Celsius) at its closest pass.?

People in North will not allow a return to violence: Anura Kumara
	
JVP leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake speaking in Kuruwita, Ratnapura on Saturday alleged that an unnecessary fear psychosis prevailed in the South, but people in the North would never leave any room for a return to violence.
He said this by addressing a gathering of scholars on the theme "People?s Government for the protection and development of the country".
Here are some excerpts of his speech, ?We should understand that Ranil and Basil no longer have a right to speak about what is good for the country. In the past 70 years, the United National Party (UNP) and Sri Lanka Freedom Party ( SLFP) have proved that they do not have a plan to develop the country. Ranil says that it would take him about 32 years to develop the country. However, it is doubtful whether he would even be alive then as he is now 70 years old. Mahinda, who was in power about 10 years is asking for another term in order to turn the country into a developed nation. These two parties together have proved that they don't know what they are doing when it comes to developing the country".
Mr. Dissanayake said that their party had requested scholars in various fields for their input on what needs to be done in order to bring about development in the country. According to him these scholars were looking at the problems faced by the country from a new point of view and the development of a country cannot take place by building concrete jungles. People?s living standards should be taken care of in order to do this.
According to him, 52% of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) has been allocated for the development of the Western Province while only a slim 4% is allocated for the development of the Anuradhapura and Polonnaruwa Districts in the North Central Province which is the agricultural heartland of the country from where the prosperity should begin. Instead of uplifting the rural economy these areas are made to endure many economic hardships. Loan providing institutions, many of whom operate from the Western Province, come to the villages with stories of success and give the poor farmers of these areas loans at 48% interest. The people are exploited by them. The interest is not charged on diminishing balance and in the end they end up paying 300 % interest thereby leaving them with no profits and sometimes this ends in suicide.
He added, ?It is the businessmen that are most sought after when it comes to marriage. No one advertises himself as a young farmer when looking for a bride. In 2016, 3200 suicides have been reported in the country while 30,000 people have been rescued while attempting to commit suicide. Sri Lanka is placed fourth when it comes to suicides. This is a frightening statistic which shows just how helpless these people have become. he said.(Ajith Lal Shantha Udaya)

Putin-Trump meeting possible to improve relations: Lavrov
	
?
REUTERS, 12th AUGUST, 2018-Russian President Vladimir Putin and U.S. President Donald Trump may meet if they feel the need to focus on improving relations, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said on Sunday, according to the RIA state news agency.
?If the leaders feel the need to meet and get back to the questions that we think should unite Russia and the United States, but which provoke rejection among some circles in the United States, I think such meeting will take place,? Lavrov said.
After their last meeting in Helsinki in July, Trump saw a wave of criticism at home for failing to confront Putin publicly over Moscow?s interference in the 2016 U.S. election, and for seeming to contradict his own intelligence agencies on the threat from Russia.
As a result, Trump postponed in late July a second meeting with Putin until next year.
A few days later, however, Putin said he wanted Trump to be his guest in Moscow, and the White House welcomed the idea despite lingering criticism over the Helsinki summit.
Russia is seeking such meetings as it is under punitive sanctions imposed by the United States and the European Union and wants them lifted.
Lavrov said on Sunday Russia was ready to extend contacts with the United States on the level of foreign ministers if the U.S. side was ready to act on a basis of equality, RIA reported.

Horizon Air employee Richard Russell told an air traffic controller he was ?just a broken man? minutes before dying late Friday in the Bombardier Q400 twin-engine turboprop plane, appearing to apologize for?his actions.? ?
In a conversation with the control tower, the pilot came across as excitable, confused and even apologetic.? ?
??Congratulations, you did it,? the control tower tells him, according to an audio feed aired on CNN.? ?
??Let?s turn around the air and land it and not hurt anybody on the ground.? ?I don?t know, man,? the pilot answers. ?I don?t want to. I was kind of hoping that was going to be it, you know...?? ?
But he later worried he was running low, saying the fuel had burned ?quite a bit faster than I expected.? The control tower then urged him to land at a nearby military base.? ?I wouldn?t want to do that. They probably have anti-aircraft,? he responds.? ?

SL currently facing a foreign currency issue: PM
	
Sri Lanka is currently facing a foreign currency issue and needs to go for an export-driven economy, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said today.
Mr. Wickremesinghe expressed this sentiment during the opening of greater Kurunegala water supply and sewerage project this evening.
?The country was facing a debt service issue when we took over and the nation?s revenue was not sufficient to settle the debts. However, we have managed to reduce the debt service to 70 per cent of our revenue. We have also been able to increase state revenue by ten per cent. However the country is short of US dollars,? the Prime Minister said.
However, the Prime Minister assured that the troubled times are ending and the country?s economy would be stable from next year.
The Prime Minister, therefore, said the country?s economy should be converted into an export-driven one. ? We will have to get more investments in order to increase our exports,? he said while highlighting that vast development projects will take place from Hambantota to Kandy via Kurunegala.
He said Kurunegala will benefit from the Central Highway project which is already underway. He said phase one of the project was handed over to China while the second phase was given to Sri Lankan firms. The Third phase will be done by a Chinese Company and the final phase in India.
In addition, he said Enterprise Sri Lanka and Gam Peraliya programmes will help economic situation of rural folk.
Minister of Water Management and Town Planning Rauff Hakeem said the second phase of the Greater Kurunegala water supply and sewerage project would be funded by Indian Export Bank. He said the cabinet has approved this funding. He said Kandy, Kuliyapitiya water projects and Negombo, Galle, Batticaloa and Kalmunei swearage projects will be launched soon.
Secretary Economic and Commere Affairs Chinese Embassy in Sri Lanka Yang Zuoyvan said Sri Lanka could benefit from Slik Raod and One Belt One Raod concept of China. He said Chinese companies are keen to invest in Sri Lanka and assist in its infrastructure facilities development. ?Chinese companies are committed to quality and preservation of the environment. Focusing on Grater Kurunegala water supply and Sewerage project he said 30,000 cubic meters of rock had to be removed to lay pipelines under the project. (Yohan Perera in Kurunegala)

Social Media: The inevitable source  in modern days? life
	
Overheard during school pick-up run. ?You will have two hate marks on your Facebook page,? a young kid obviously annoyed at something tells his mother.??
?What did you say, where did you learn that, you don?t even have a Facebook page,? the incredulous mother blurts out, her eyes wide as marbles at what she just heard. This eight-year-old, who presumably does not have a Facebook account is nevertheless aware of social media and the intimate role it plays in his mother?s life. Before he could ride a bicycle, he probably played games on a smartphone.??
This is the reach of social media. And it is going to keep growing. This is the reach and impact that most main stream media in Sri Lanka are yet to properly grasp or to use as platforms.??
From the beginning most of the main stream media just replicated what was being put on their traditional platforms on the web and in turn on social media. There were situations where newspapers would run headlines longer than 140 characters on twitter and the tweet would look like gibberish. Even now there are journalists who have not grasped the concept of the micro-blog of 280 characters and the tweets, more like essays, end up broken automatically into two.??
The TV channels had some advantage since they were dabbling in images, they could use this on the digital platforms and appeal to the habits of those who are using handheld devices and not broadsheet newspapers or bulky TV sets.??
In Sri Lanka, it is the gossip sites that have multiplied with huge followings. The mushrooming sites and affiliated social media accounts have garnered the greatest number of followers in the vernacular. Their attraction is such that even TV and radio stations have begun to use the word gossip in the tag lines for the digital sites. These sites use user-generated content on top of the main news coverage.??
They are also not bound by the professionalism and ethics of main stream media ? thus rumour and innuendo simply appear on the them as rumour and innuendo. But they are mighty popular ? last month one single post on one such site, on an alleged clause in the new constitutional reforms relating to dual citizens contesting elections was shared over 450 times on Facebook. The story had no basis except a speech and there was no double checking done on the part of the news channel.??
But this is the kind of misinformation that is out there. This example is probably a lame version as it at least had a speech as a source. There are some which are outright fabrications. It is with these lies that we will have huge problems. Fake news and machine generated content are a vicious combination.??
Already we have seen in other parts of the world how social media can be leveraged to create, amplify some and drown out others. The web is a massive echo chamber and machines are being used to create noise.?
There is even a new term for all this - computation of influence, fancy sounding, but utterly dangerous. Machines can be programmed to detect certain words, phrases and accounts and amplify them.??
You actually don?t need bot armies at your disposal to do these, there are companies out there that will get you 5000 re-tweets for less than $30 and 10,000 for less than $50.??
Already there is research by Sri Lankan experts that indicate a trend of 100?s of machine-controlled twitter accounts with ostensible Sri Lankan origins that were created between late March and May. We are yet to see the being deployed, but they remain weaponized.??

Strikes - EDITORIAL
	
?
n Wednesday July 8, at around 3.00 pm, the engine drivers, railway guards and a few other affiliated trade unions -- with no prior notice -- suddenly went on strike. The union representatives tell us that the salary anomalies due to these workers have not been met by the government over a time.?
With the cost of living skyrocketing, one could not be blamed for feeling the poor engine drivers, station masters, railway guards et al were justified in demanding their dues. But, their sudden strike, with no prior notice, left thousands of office workers with no real alternative to find means of transport to their homes. Even worse, many hundreds, if not thousands of school children preparing for the GCE A/level exam were left in a quandary.?
Scenes at the country?s main station were pathetic, mothers with crying little children left high and dry. Suddenly the strike became the ?straw? which so-to-say ?broke the camels back?. Angry commuters stoned railway buildings and went in search of railway workers to take out their anger.? Fortunately, timely police intervention prevented this section of ?public servants? from being manhandled by irate commuters -- the mass of poorer sections in our society forced to depend on the public transport system and who can ill-afford private transport.?
The richer classes are not, and will not be affected by these and other strikes which are called, especially because it is the poor who are dependent on these services.? It would appear that the engine drivers and the railway guards are blissfully unaware of the problems of the poor, burdened by the ever rising cost of living. But then engine drivers and railway guards are among the highest paid category of employees in the country (not of course counting doctors, CEOs and super executives in the mercantile sector).?
While a government graduate teacher receives a measly sum of around Rs. 33,340/- per month as starting salary for the essential service he/she provides the country for moulding the future citizens, or a Grama Niladhari receiving anything between Rs.15,000/- to 20,000/- per month, or a Samurdhi Niladhari receiving around Rs.18,000/- a month; a Railway Engine Driver earns a total of around Rs. 275,000/- a month. A Railway guard around Rs.186,000/- a month and a Railway Station Master Rs.163,000/- monthly. Pity these poor workers of whose take-home pay is on average; a princely Rs. 208,000/-!
Little wonder they call wildcat strikes greatly inconveniencing the public. Their reality is in sharp contrast to those of the ordinary masses of this country. Unlike ?Oliver?, in Charles Dickens novel ?Oliver Twist?, these workers are not asking for more, they are demanding more, and holding the poor to ransom to achieve their demands.?
But then, the railway workers are merely emulating the example of an even higher-paid category of government servants -- the doctors -- who without batting an eyelid, take the Hypocratical Oath, with no intention of ever keeping it. This band of ?public servants?, ?prosperous members of a once noble profession? as Prof. A.N.I. Ekanayaka, Emeritus Professor & former Dean Faculty of Dental Science, Peradeniya refers to them; go on strike with nary a care for the millions whom they have sworn to care for.?
Today these worthies are demanding the scrapping an FTA agreement between the Sri Lankan government and the government of Singapore under which medically qualified doctors from that country would also be able to practise in Sri Lanka. A failure to do this doctors threaten, will force them to go on indefinite strike.
While doctors claim their action is for public benefit, it appears otherwise. An increase in the number of doctors in the country would increase the patient-to-doctor ratio, thereby possibly endangering in the future, the present lucrative emoluments doctors now receive. The vocation of doctors is a concern for life and death. They along with the police and armed services normally do not resort to strike action, because it jeopardizes the lives of people.
Additionally, doctors like the engine drivers and their like-minded comrades-in-arms who suddenly went on strike on August 8, study and receive training free -- at great cost to the millions of poor citizens of this country. They owe a debt of gratitude to the millions of poor who pay for their education.
Unfortunately, the poor are only repaid by these ?public servants? who are also free of the burden of paying income tax, with wildcat strikes and other absurdities.??

The British Council?s English assessment tool Aptis is now available at Third Space Global, Orion Ci
	
The British Council in Sri Lanka has appointed Third Space Global at Orion City as a reseller of its popular English assessment tool known as ?Aptis?. This new partnership is intended to make it easier for organizations to access Aptis to assess the English language proficiency of their staff.
Aptis is a new generation, industry-agnostic English language test designed to provide reliable results at an affordable cost. The tool was developed by the British Council?s Assessment Research Group as a complete English language testing solution and is in use by companies like GlaxoSmithkline, Vodafone and Siemens globally. Aptis is widely recognized as a smarter way to evaluate English language proficiency as it tests the reading, listening, writing and speaking skills of an individual. Users can choose any one skill or all skills along with the compulsory core component, making it a very flexible tool to use in line with the user?s budget.
Corporates can use Aptis to assess the language proficiency of their staff, regardless of their experience, skills or computer literacy level. This could be in preparation for employee development programmes, as part of the recruitment process or simply to check English proficiency levels in general. They can use the service at the Orion City premises of Third Space Global. For individuals, Aptis is a tool that can help in further preparation of English language studies or to advance career development.?
In Sri Lanka, Aptis is a highly affordable tool that can be used by almost anyone. The service provider Third Space Global is a UK owned company based in Sri Lanka- it is building the world?s first global and scalable teaching network of intelligent, young and driven problem solvers by linking students in the UK with tutors from Sri Lanka and other countries. ?Aptis is a great tool that is hugely affordable because it?s flexible,? says CEO Roshan Nilaweera. ?We?re excited to offer this service at our premises and look forward to building a network of professionals using Aptis to advance their career or business.?
Users can visit the Third Space Global premises at Orion City to self-administer the test or have a trained expert conduct it on their behalf. The test is delivered in diverse ways to suit organization needs-by computer, pen and paper, or even phone for speech based assessments.?
For the British Council, housing the service at Third Space means that it becomes more accessible to businesses and individuals. The organization recently completed a series of awareness sessions at Orion City for human resource development practitioners. ?There was interest and much of that enthusiasm had to do with how easy to use and practical the tool was,? says Dileepa Manawadu, Head of Business Development, UK Qualifications of the British Council in Sri Lanka. ?English is one of the three languages most widely used for doing business in the world. We believe that Aptis will be a terrific addition to human resource development programmes and individual portfolios.?

The New, Super Powerful Galaxy Note9
	
Samsung Electronics today announced the latest addition to its premium Note series with Galaxy Note9. The Note series has been recognized for including the company?s latest ground-breaking innovations, and Galaxy Note9 builds on this legacy with a premium smartphone that delivers the ultimate in performance; a new S Pen with connectivity for the first time ever; and Samsung?s most intelligent camera yet.
All Day Performance
People rely on their smartphones for almost everything they do ? all-day, every day. They need a phone that can keep up without having to find the nearest outlet to recharge, delete pictures to free up storage for their next snap, anxiously wait for their video to download before boarding their flight, or deal with any lag time when gaming.
They need a phone that won?t let them down and Galaxy Note9 delivers.
All Day Battery: Galaxy Note9?s 4,000mAh battery, the largest ever on a flagship Galaxy phone for long-lasting power to use all-day to talk, text, play games and watch movies from morning to night.
?
Store More, Delete Less: Galaxy Note9 is available with two internal storage options ? choose from 128GB or 512GB. And with the ability to insert a microSD card, Galaxy Note9 is 1TB ready to have peace of mind knowing there is enough room for favourite photos, videos and apps.
?
Speed and Power: Galaxy Note9 is a super powerful smartphone with cutting-edge 10nm processor and support for the fastest network speeds available in the market (up to 1.2 gigabits per second) to stream and download without slowing down. Galaxy Note9 also includes an industry-leading and Samsung developed Water Carbon Cooling system and on-device AI-based performance adjusting algorithm to deliver the powerful yet stable performance.
?The Evolution of the S Pen
The S Pen is the signature feature of the Note series ? it?s how users have made their mark, and how Samsung has expanded the notion of what a smartphone can do. What began as a tool for writing and drawing is now putting more power and control in their hands.
Now with Bluetooth Low-Energy (BLE) support, the new S Pen delivers an entirely new way to use the Note. With just a click, it?s now possible to take selfies and group pictures, present slides, pause and play video, and more. Developers can even integrate the S Pen?s new, advanced BLE functionalities into their apps later this year.
The Intelligent Camera That Makes Pictures Perfect
It can be hard to take a picture that looks just like the ones the pros take ? but it shouldn?t be. Galaxy Note9 builds on Samsung?s industry-leading camera technologies with new capabilities that take the work out of getting the perfect picture.
Scene Optimizer: Galaxy Note9?s camera is Samsung?s smartest yet. It uses intelligence to identify elements of a photo, such as scene and subject, to automatically classify it into one of 20 categories and instantly optimize it based on the category. The result is a stunning, lifelike image with bold colors and dynamic definition.
?
Flaw Detection: The first shot doesn?t always come out right, but the Galaxy Note9 lets users know if there?s something wrong, so they can take another picture without losing the moment. An immediate notification will appear if the image is blurry, the subject blinked, there is a smudge on the lens, or there?s backlight impacting the quality of the image.
?
Premium Camera: With the unique combination of advanced intelligence features and leading premium hardware, Galaxy Note9?s camera is the best on the market. It comes with advanced noise reduction technology, and a Dual Aperture lens, which adjusts to light just like the human eye. No matter the lighting conditions, Galaxy Note9?s top-tier camera delivers a crystal-clear shot.
Premium Experiences: From Work to Play
The Infinity Display is the cornerstone of Samsung?s design heritage, and Galaxy Note9 has the largest edge-to-edge display ever on a Note. The 6.4-inch Super AMOLED Infinity Display provides a truly immersive multimedia experience. Galaxy Note9?s Infinity Display is complemented by stereo speakers, which are tuned by AKG, and ability to deliver Dolby Atmos? immersive audio for a life like experience. Mobile video has never looked or sounded better than it does on Galaxy Note9. YouTube named Galaxy Note9 as a Signature Device able to deliver a best-in-class YouTube experience.
Galaxy Note9 also delivers a PC-like experience with Samsung DeX. Users can work on presentations, edit photos, and watch their favorite show all powered by their phone. Experience Samsung DeX with easy-to-carry HDMI adapters. When connected to a monitor, Galaxy Note9 can power a virtualized desktop and even serve as a fully-functional second screen. Take notes with the S Pen while watching a video, or use Galaxy Note9 as a trackpad, to right-click, drag and drop, and use multiple windows on a monitor. It?s never been easier to be more productive.
Galaxy and Beyond
The premium Galaxy technologies come standard with Note9: fast wireless charging, IP68 water and dust resistance4 and Samsung services such as Samsung Health and Samsung Pay. Galaxy Note9 features Samsung?s trusted, defense-grade Knox security platform and biometric security options including fingerprint scanning, iris scanning and facial recognition capabilities to keep important information safe.
Galaxy Note9 pre-order period will be from August 14 - 27 through JKOA, Softlogic, Singhagiri, Singer, Damro, Dialog, Mobitel, wOw.lk, Takas.lk and Daraz.lk and will be offered in Midnight Black and Metallic Copper with matching S Pen, and Ocean Blue with a Yellow S Pen.

THE UBIQUITOUS  UNIVERSITY PROBLEM
	
?
The sad, bad state of our Universities and University students has been an ongoing problem for the last 40 years. Time has not solved anything. Actually things are worse than they were for nowadays, University students and their ?DEMANDS? are reaching epic proportions.??
One would imagine that these students would have a deep sense of gratitude towards a Government that gives them a free education up to University level. But no! They enter Universities with a sense of entitlement which they certainly do not deserve to have. They demand ?Rights? with no sense of ?Duty? and I have to say that this attitude is entirely the fault of a Government that panders to these young ingrates and does not make them aware of the tremendous cost of all this free education.??
As a taxpayer I am outraged. As an educationist I am aghast. As a citizen, I am furious with a Government that allows this to happen in a country that is trying to give its ungrateful youth what even wealthy countries in the West do not give their citizens.??
Let us take the USA. Higher education at a good University is astronomically costly. Most students (unless their parents have saved or are wealthy) take loans. After they graduate, the Govt. DOES NOT offer them jobs. They must find their own jobs and start repaying the University that educated them. Unless they win a scholarship IT IS NOT A FREE RIDE as it is in Sri Lanka. That system works well.??
So what can WE do? Obviously Free Education cannot be revised. Of course it should be, but politicians fear for their votes. Yet there are many corrective paths that can be taken if those in charge of Education will listen.??
We must be aware that at least 40% of University students are there because of that iniquitous quota system that sends the best of a bad lot to be educated to Universities (even to the Medical College where a goodly number need to redo exams at least once or twice.) These unprepared students enter with all sorts of psychological problems, one of which is a feeling of inferiority. The quota system (for those who do not know what it is) began years ago which gave placements to students from every province on a quota system whether those students were suitable or not. A high ranking student of Colombo would lose a place to a low ranking child from an out station because of this system. At one time students were leaving Colombo to sit their exams from outstations feeling their chances of getting into University were better than if they were in Colombo! That little ploy soon came to a speedy end but can anyone be blamed for trying? The quota system was supposed to have been introduced as a temporary measure until all schools were brought up to one standard! An unattainable and impossible goal was it not? But here we are ? still continuing with a most unfair educational method of placement. It is discrimination in reverse for the better students.??
A writer recently remarked that ragging is part of the culture of a University. ?Ragging? he wrote, ?brings those who think high and mighty of themselves to one platform? This is not strictly true. What sadistic ragging used to do was to pull everyone down not lift anyone up. Students do not enter University feeling superior. But they are PERCEIVED to be thus by those who do not come from better schools or more affluent homes. Ergo, they are ragged.??
Now to come to a list of possible ?cures????
1. Let us revert to the system of interviewing applicants to the University. That old system of Vivas was an excellent idea. Verbal conversation with aspirants to a higher education will give those conducting the interview a fairly good idea of the quality and potential of students hoping for admission.??
There used to be such a body in the past. My mother, Deshabandu Clara Motwani, was part of it. It comprised well known personalities, not necessarily in education but were Mercantile Director and CEOs who were capable of judging youth. They were totally incorruptible. No one would dream of approaching anyone on that committee with a request to grant a favour.??
In her book ?The Sweet And Simple Kind? Professor Emeritus of Macquarie University, Dr. Yasmine Gooneratne mentions that my mother interviewed her when she entered the Peredeniya University for her undergraduate studies. The questions asked were not necessarily academic. A girl from Matara? who was interviewed on the same day was asked what reading she had done outside her English Literature syllabus. She answered truthfully, ?If the committee thinks I had time to do much outside reading after coping with the syllabi, it is going to be disappointed?. The committee laughed and she was offered a place. My mother told me afterwards that the child showed a sense of humour and the ability to deal with a difficult question honestly. She was a unanimous choice. The committee asked most applicants about Sport, interests out side school, personal attitudes etc. That viva was an excellent idea. Revive it.??
2. Today, students entering the (formerly) hallowed grounds of learning should sign a bond ensuring that if they ever go on strike or cause disruption to the normal routine, they will either lose their place in the University permanently or else be banned for a year or so. They have absolutely no right to strike with all the free instruction they are getting. If they have any problems they must be resolved by discussion. NEVER by public protest. We, the taxpayers should be the only ones allowed to protest!??
3. University students should not interfere in what is not their business. What the Govt. decides to do about SAITM is no concern of theirs. It is only a certain amount of envy and insecurity that causes all this uproar. A perfectly good North Medical College was closed down due to the action of those who felt a private education would supersede their?s in quality. Naturally it might have done so since the type of child at NMC was not entering the NMC on a quota system. He certainly would have been better suited to a medical career than quite a few in the Govt. Medical College. The NMC could have awarded Scholarships to bright kids as is done in the USA. (Rarely in the study of Medicine). But to do away with an entire College was lunacy.??
?
"Politics and politicians should not be allowed to have anything to do with admissions or punishments of the University
?Ragging brings those who think high and mighty of themselves to one platform? - A writer
They have absolutely no right to strike with all the free instruction they are getting"
4. Politics and politicians should not be allowed to have anything to do with admissions or punishments of the University. The Vice Chancellor, Carefully chosen with an excellent background should be given the power to run the University without any political interference. Most of our politicians are uneducated anyway so why should they be allowed to tamper with something they do not even understand? I once heard a University VIP speak at a public Meeting. She could hardly speak in English and what she said was quite immature and silly. Poor English can be overlooked but not subject matter.??
5. A dress code would be a good idea. Those ?Denim clad, pony tailed and unshaven boys,? could give place to well groomed undergrads. I am not talking of expensive clothing here. Just neat and clean attire.??
I am assuming that the Professors themselves will be caring people not given to running to politicians for appointments as now happens. I am sure they are well grounded in their subjects but I am told that University appointments ARE politically influenced. What a tragedy for the standard of our Universities.??
We cannot but help harking back to the days of Sir Ivor Jennings, Dr. Nicholas Attygalle and others of like calibre. Surely we have such people still available???
?I just have to tell an amusing story here. Apparently on one of his visits to Sri Lanka, Lee Kwan Yu was playing golf with Dudley Senanayake, the then Prime Minister. While still on the green the news was brought to Dudley that the University Students in Peradeniya were rioting. It quite upset the PM and he told Lee Kwan Yu about what was throwing him off his game. The Singaporean PM is alleged to have breezily replied , ?What?s the problem? Just shoot one or two. The protest will end.???
Now I am not suggesting we do this. But we can certainly come down hard on all this lawlessness that closes Universities and send students home to hibernate for months. I am told that it is only 8% of University undergrads who are trouble shooters. The others are forced to go along with them. If this is true then most of the present undergrads will be very happy if strong arm tactics are used.??
There is no doubt that every taxpayer in this country will be totally approving. I for one will pay my taxes gladly. Something I do under protest each year (at the moment.)??

There would have been no Buddhism in Sri Lanka: If not for Ven. Saranakara Thera
	
On the Esala Poya? day of 1778, two hundred and forty years ago Sangharaja Welivita Asarana Sarana Saranankara Thera departed from his life on earth. If not for this Thera there would have been no Buddhism in?Sri Lanka.
Propagating and safeguarding Buddhism was no easy task as he was nearly beheaded by King Kirthi Sri Rajasinghe, for an alleged conspiracy, but saner counsel prevailed with the intervening of the Nilames at Malwatte?Maha Vihara.
Trekking twenty kilometres on the Kandy - Murutalawa Road, I was invited by the Principal of Welivita Junior School D.R.W.B. Hennegama, where they had organised a Pirith ceremony in honour of the Sangharaja on the?Esala Poya Day.
I took this opportunity to visit the birthplace and the temple where he lived and the Viharege, where he prayed, built by his mother?for the Thera.
The sight of the Viharege made me wonder about the callous attitude of the Archaeological Department, where over for one year, the Viharege has been covered with zinc sheets leaving it open to inclement weather. The original paintings are fading away with the damage caused by rain while the nearby Buddha Statue has no arms. The original Sedent Buddha statue through some miracle remains intact.
?
The Viharege made me wonder about the callous attitude of the Archaeological Department
Millions were spent, but the birthplace remained in the state of disrepair
The present incumbent Venerable Aluthgama Medananda Thera lamented that he had to plead with the Archaeological Department to erect a covering over the Viharege, so that rain would not further damage the building and its paintings.?
The Thera also said that the former Governor of the Central Province Ms Nilluka Ekanayake allocated Rs. 700,000 to cover the roof of the temple where the Sangharaja lived.
They covered the roof with unsuitable roof tiles and as a result, the walls have been damaged due to the leaks?in the roof.
Venerable Medananda Thera said that before long the entire Viharege may collapse and also the valuable paintings dated over two hundred years ago may be lost forever.
It is indeed a sorry state of affairs.?
The Sangharaja was born at Tumpane in June 1698 of the Christian era, but the date of birth cannot be verified. The birth is referred to as the fifteenth year during the reign of Wimaladharma Suriya II on the seventh day in the dark half-moon of the month of Poson. Some say it is the 16th and others say it could be the 19th of June 1698
However, it is well known that Venerable Welivita was born in this remote village of Welivita named as Kulatunge Banda, whose father was known as Kiri Banda, a farmer. At the age of 12 years, this young Kulatunge Banda was entrusted to Venerable Suriyagoda Rajaguru to be ordained a monk at Suriyagoda in the now Yatinuwara electorate.
It is from here that he learned the fundamentals of Buddhism and went in search of an inner dimension of Buddhism at a time when there were no books or scholars to learn from.
Before he was handed over to Suriyagoda Priest, he meditated in a cave at Balane with an equally young boy. There are two rocks one above the railway line and one below.?
They used the rock above to bath and the one below to live and meditate. Both could be located even today. The two caves are separated by the Kandy -Colombo railway track. But, unfortunately, even during the 2,500-year celebrations, no one took any notice to erect a sign to indicate that this Venerated member of the Sangha lived or meditated in this cave, nor in the places he visited to preach.
It is to his memory that Buddhism remains in this country, but little is said or done to remember him, not for the present generation, but for the future generations to come.
The fact remains that the birthplace of the Sangharaja should be made a National Monument or as the residents of the area point out that the entire complex, which includes the Cultural Centre, the Temple the Buddha-ge along with the surrounding premises where the Sangharaja and Kirthisri Rajasinghe had planted two Bo trees.
Thanks to the foresight of the then Minister of Cultural Affairs Lakshman Jayakoddy, a cultural centre was constructed and the entire area was demarcated as a holy site. Yet only the Pansala and the Viharege remain as protected monuments.
?
"Venerable Aluthgama Medananda Thera lamented that he had to plead with the Archaeological Department to erect a covering over the Viharege, so that rain would not further damage the building and?its paintings."
?
There was a time when the officers of the State banished Venerable Asarana Sarana Welivita Thera without the knowledge of the King due to jealousy. The Thera was banished to Laggala and was also almost beheaded for an alleged crime against the King at Malwatte Chapter.
However, when a wisecrack Brahmin arrived in the Kandyan Kingdom with uncontested words and arguments against Buddhism, the King sought the help of Venerable Welivita.
The King was informed that the Thera had been banished to Laggala, whereon, the King sent his own Palanquin to bring back Welivita Thera to face the wisecrack Brahmin.
There is no doubt that Buddhism?s renaissance commenced with the entry of Venerable Welivita Sri Asarana Sarana Saranankara as a monk, who later was bestowed the title of Sangharaja by King Kirthi Sri Rajasinghe.
During the celebrations of the 250th year of bringing Upasampada to Sri Lanka, millions was spent, but the birthplace remained in a state of disrepair? It is time that the Government or the Archaeological authorities took action to preserve the Birthplace of this monk, without whom there would be no Buddhism in Sri Lanka.
The Sangharaja established the Silvata?s Association the forerunner to this renaissance. It was a time when there were no monks who have had Upasampada and Welivita Saranakara was determined to bring Upasampada from Siam or present Thailand.
There had been Burmese monks who had come to Sri Lanka and performed Upasamapda on the banks of Mahaweli River at Getambe, but that too had faded away.
Welivita Saranakara was bent on bringing Upasampada and approached King Kirthi Sri Rajasinghe, through a Hindu, he arranged to bring Upasampada from Siam or present Thailand.
As a last resort, the King called upon a meeting at Poya Maluwa Vihare in Malwatte and selected the persons who should proceed on this errand to Siam (Thailand).
In this five were selected was Wilbagedera The Dutch released a vessel named Tharaka.
There were two ships which were sent on this mission, one was the ship supplied by the Dutch Tharka and the other was a Thai ship.
Wilbagedera travelled in the Thai ship while others travelled in the ship provided by the Dutch.
After the arrival of the Thai delegation headed by Elder Upali Thera, they stayed at Godapola before they proceeded to Kandy and at Godapola. The Siamese Priests taught the Sri Lankan Priests how to don the robe and the finer points of the Upasampada ceremony.
On the Poya day of 1753, the first Upasampada was held, firstly on a member of the Thai delegation and secondly on Mahanayake Kobbekaduwa and later on Welivita Asarana Sarana Saranankara Thera.
On this day, one member from the Asgiri Chapter received Upasamapda for the first time. There were five pupils of the Sangharaja and the first being Venerable Thibbotuwawe Sri Siddhartha Buddhrakitha Thera.
It is time that the government and Ministry of Buddhasana seriously viewed to Gazette this area as a Sacred area and restore its?
forgotten glory.?

'To resolve ministerial dilemma: Better for NPC ministers to resign'
	
Northern Province Governor Reginald Cooray today suggested that the Northern Provincial Council (NPC) ministers should resign so as to resolve the issue, which has arisen from the change in its ministerial composition.
He said the composition had changed in the wake of the Appeal Court reinstating B. Deniswaran as a NPC minister.
"With the reinstatement, the number of ministers had increased to six. This has prevented the council from taking decisions or enacting laws. The best solution available to resolve this matter is for the ministers to resign and a new set of ministers appointed. According to clause 154 (E) of the Constitution, the Chief Minister is empowered to appoint ministers. I, as governor, have no authority to appoint or remove ministers. Therefore, Chief Minister C.V. Wigneswaran should resolve this matter without further delay," the Governor said during a visit to the Advanced Technological Institute in Jaffna.
He highlighted the fact that students from different ethnic communities islandwide including Hambantota, Kurunegala, Puttalam and Badulla study at the institute.
"This is a good precedent for reconciliation. We should commend these students for taking the initiative to study here while staying with Tamil families. This is a better way to end hostilities among us," he said.
He said he would do his best to find solutions to the problems faced by the institute after discussing them with the President and the Higher Education Minister. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

White nationalists expected to rally in Washington
	
?
DPA, 12th DPA, 2018-Hundreds of white nationalists are expected to hold a demonstration on Sunday in Washington, marking one year since a Unite the Right rally where an anti-racism counter protester was killed by a far-right extremist.
Police said they were prepared for the rally in the capital city with the counter protests likely to be larger than the demonstration by the far-right.
Organizers had tried to hold the anniversary rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, the same place as last year?s deadly gathering, but they were blocked and moved the event to Washington.
US President Donald Trump, who controversially said about last year?s rally that there was an ?egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence on many sides,? weighed in the day before the anniversary.
?The riots in Charlottesville a year ago resulted in senseless death and division. We must come together as a nation. I condemn all types of racism and acts of violence. Peace to ALL Americans!? the president wrote on Twitter on Saturday.?
Local police in DC and in counties in the neighbouring state of Virginia were coordinating with federal security forces.
