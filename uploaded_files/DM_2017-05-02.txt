A new robotic drill that works like Google Maps
	

UTTAH, (Daily Mail, London), 1 May 2017 -  A robotic drill could be the future of surgery and could help cut the time of a routine brain operation from two hours - to two-and-a-half minutes. 
Developers believe the computer-driven gadget, which works like Google Maps, could play a pivotal role in future surgical procedures. 
It can make one type of complex cranial surgery 50 times faster than standard procedures, researchers say. 
They claim the drill produces fast, clean and safe cuts, reducing the time the wound is open and the patient is anaesthetised. This decreases the chances of infection, human error and surgical cost.In complex surgeries, especially cranial ones, surgeons typically use hand drills to make intricate openings, adding hours to a procedure. 
Dr William Couldwell, neurosurgeon at the University of Utah, where the drill is being developed, said existing procedures were slow. He saw a need for a device that could alleviate this burden and make the process more efficient.

ComBanks Paymaster pays out record Rs.11.6bn in three days
	
More than 2,500 institutions paid out Rs.11.6 billion in early salaries and bonuses over just three days in April 2017 via Paymaster  the sophisticated bulk payments platform of Commercial Bank of Ceylon.
The bank reports that on April 5, 6 and 7, Paymaster processed a total of 375,666 electronic payments on behalf of these institutions, with 53 percent of the beneficiaries being account holders of Commercial Bank and the rest customers of other banks.
On just two of these days, April 6 and 7, Paymaster dispensed more than Rs.9 billion to nearly 300,000 recipients in an impressive demonstration of its capacity, the bank said.
Paymaster enables organisations or individuals to make virtually any type of payment to multiple beneficiaries by simply uploading a file to Commercial Banks online platform. There are no limits to the number of transactions and if the paying party and beneficiary both have accounts at Commercial Bank, the transfer of funds is virtually instant.
Widely used by companies to pay employee salaries, commissions and numerous other payments to their suppliers and customers, Paymaster was upgraded in 2016 to offer a dual and multilevel authorisation module for bulk payments, a user administration facility and a shared log-in feature for group accounts.
The new version also supports payment of interest and dividends, agent commissions, insurance claims, bulk utility payments and statutory payments to the Employees Trust Fund (ETF) and Employees Provident Fund (EPF).
The record disbursements prior to the Avurudu holidays reaffirm that Paymaster has become the bulk payment platform of choice for many businesses and institutions, Commercial Bank Chief Operating Officer S. Renganathan said.
It is the benchmark for reliable and speedy large-scale payments, minimising transaction time, costs and the risks associated with the physical handing of money.

Desperate lives inside refugee camps
	
Typically, refugee camps are temporary living settlements that accommodate displaced persons who have fled their home countries. When it comes to the context of the Sri Lankan civil war, it is a known fact that many local Tamils fled the country at the height of the war, with the hope of returning when a conducive environment is created for peaceful coexistence, free of violence and warfare. However, unfortunately, their settlements seem to have become permanent with their stay counting more than 27 long years.

Api mehe thani wela (we are isolated here), 49-year-old Nimala, a Sri Lankan refugee at the Gummidipoondi camp in Chennai told Daily Mirror recently.
According to the 1951 Refugee Convention of the United Nations and its 1967 Protocol relating to the status of refugees, a refugee is an individual who, owing to a well-founded fear of being persecutedfor reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion, is outside the country of his or her nationality, and is unable or unwilling to avail him or herself to the protection of that country.
However, the Tamil Nadu Government, under the directions of the Indian Central Government which had not ratified the aforementioned legal documents, provided Sri Lankan refugees immediate relief when they entered Indian soil in early 1980s.

"As a result of the many restrictions imposed on Sri Lankan Tamil refugees, securing employment has become more than adaunting task"
Education

Inside the Gummidipoondi camp are some 900 youngsters receiving education. However, they receive this facility only upto the tenth grade, said Mathews (46), a father of two. 
Following the assassination of former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi in 1991, the admission of our children to schools was suspended by the then Tamil Nadu Government. But, later in 1993, our children were given the chance to study upto the twelfth grade in schools in Tamil Nadu.The law is not practiced here. Our children are denied of the right to continue their studies after the tenth grade," he said.
Some parents here fund their childrens higher education at private institutes, although they are facing severe financial constraints and the government has not extended any support monetarily. Either they will do so or give up hopes because they are unable to afford private education. Nevertheless, it is noteworthy to see several Sri Lankan refugee parents toiling to finance their childrens education.

"Denial of access to education has severely affected the children of Sri Lankan Tamil refugees. Making the situation even worse, the young refugee lads who are forced to discontinue their education from tenth grade, often get addicted to drugs"







Maya (23), the only daughter of Mathews, is currently reading for her MBA in a private college in Gummidipoondi. Even if she completed her studies amidst all difficulties, she will still be unable to secure a government job as that option is unavailable to the children of refugees. 
Denial of access to education has severely affected the children of Sri Lankan Tamil refugees. Making the situation even worse, the young refugee lads who are forced to discontinue their education from tenth grade, often get addicted to drugs, mainly Cannabis  not to say the situation is identical in every Sri Lankan Tamil refugee camp in the state.When one treads along the shady path of the Gummidipoondi camp, groups of languishing youths could be seen playing Omi, a popular card game, while parents keep worrying about their inability to offer their children a bright future.
Freedom of Movement

We savour no social or political right as we are governed by the 1946 Foreigners Act. We used to have comfortable lives in our country before the outbreak of the gruesome and bloodily war. Today, we are leading a very restless camp life. We cannot leave the camp unless the authorities give us permission to do so. We are allowed to go in the morning, but must return before dusk, said Jothika, a mother of one. 
According to her, Sri Lankan refugees who wished to stay outside the camp for more than one day have to obtain written permission from the camp officer, which usually takes a few days.







Commenting on this, Kennedy (52) said they were detained inside the camp.We have no freedom here. We are treated as outsiders. We are neither here nor there. It is not like we are staying here willingly, he said, adding that the feeling of living in ones own country could not be found by living anywhere else in the world. 
Ganesh, a refugee compelled to discontinue education.
Employment

As a result of the many restrictions imposed on Sri Lankan Tamil refugees, securing employment has become more than a daunting task. They arrived in India without a single document to prove their identity. Even the ones who studied upto a certain stage are unable to produce necessary documents to find a job in Tamil Nadu. They can only find jobs that pay daily wages.
However, a survey conducted by the US Committee for Refugees and Immigrants (USCRI) stated that as Sri Lankan refugees were permitted to work during day time, many refugees worked on the local railway while many others engaged in bricklaying and painting.







Commenting on this, Samuel (43) from Avissawella who is presently employed as a security guard in a private institution in Gummidipoondi, said men must hunt for jobs that pay well, as it was difficult to survive with the limited financial support extended by the Tamil Nadu Government. 
The government has issued refugee identity cards for each of us. The breadwinners of families are given Rs. 1,000 per month. Those above 18 years of age receive Rs. 750 while those under 18, Rs. 300.The sum paid to us has not been revised despite the rising cost of living. We cannot live on with these trivial amounts even for a week. That is why we search for jobs, Samuel said.
Sabhu, a painter and the breadwinner of a seven-member family, said it was very difficult to obtain permission from the authorities to work outside the camp.If you have money, you can bribe the officers and get things done, he added.
Rations, healthcare and other entitlements

Results of the efforts by refugees to improve the conditions of their settlements

The Tamil Nadu Government has issued ration cards among Sri Lankan refugees living in camps in the state. Refugees need to present their cards to obtain rations.Smitha, a mother (52) of five, said the government provided them essential goods at low prices.
Each adult receives twelve kilos of rice per month, while a child is issued three. Every family gets two kilos of sugar monthly. However, the goods issued are inadequate, she said.
The refugees who dwelled in camps which were of dilapidated condition had somehow managed to improve the conditions of their settlements.Terrance, another Sri Lankan Tamil refugee, said they found it extremely difficult to move about in confined camps that were covered with tar sheets. But as families started to expand, they had added some installations to these settlements. 
We suffered a lot inside camps during summer and heavy rain. No one was generous enough to help us. As time passed by, we found jobs that helped us earn some money and turn our camps into small houses, Terrance said. 
According to USCRI, the Tamil Nadu Revenue Department is recording the purchases made by Sri Lankan refugees. Whatever the additions they make to the settlements, they do not own them. According to the law, they cannot bring anything toSri Lanka on their return.We dont have the right to legally own a house, property or vehicle. We left our things in our country, Terrance said.
When it comes to medical care, it is quite satisfying for refugees as they have access to free medical treatment in government -recognised hospitals.







I am not entitled to any ration given by the government. I am living with my elder sister. I dont know the reason. I tried to hold discussions with relevant authorities several times, but to no avail. However, medical services are free for us.
If anyone falls ill, we have to stand in queues for hours. We are forced to remain for longer hours than others because we are not citizens. Often, we have to buy medicine from pharmacies. Some check-ups and scans are recommended to be taken from private institutions. We cannot afford them, said Reeta (68).
It is nothing but disheartening to seeSri Lankans with refugee statuses living in Indian camps with no solution to their plight. The Indian Government has not yet decided to recognise them as citizens of India, as their existing law does not permit it. Some 90% of these deprived Lankans dream about returning to their home country.
The final section of the article series will be serialized this week. It will discuss the pressing issues that hold them back from stepping outside the camps to return to Sri Lanka, and efforts to travel to Australia illegally.

Dondra lighthouse re-opens to the public on May 4
	
Ports and Shipping Minister Arjuna Ranatunga yesterday advised officials to re-open the Dondra lighthouse to the public on May 4, Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA) Media Secretary MP Thameera Manju said.
He said the minister informed the officials to complete the renovations and re-open the lighthouse for public viewing.
The opening ceremony would take place under the patronage of Minister Ranatunga, Deputy Minister Nishantha Muttuhettigama, SLPA Chairman Dhammika Ranatunga and several other distinguished guests, Manju said.
He said the lighthouse was renovated by the SLPA in 2000 and it was not open to the public thereafter as the route to the area was unapproachable and also due to security based issues.
After the lighthouse re-opens on Thursday (4) several special programmes would be implemented to upgrade the present facilities available to the public while a set of programmes for foreigners had also been planned, Manju said.
The Dondra Lighthouse was constructed in 1887 and was being monitored by the SLPA. James Nicholas Douglas has been credited with the construction of this eye-catching masterpiece. Approximately 30000 sterling pounds was spent on the construction of the lighthouse which has a height of 49 metres and comprises of seven floors. It has 196 steps to reach the top and is considered one of the four leading lighthouses in Sri Lanka that have earned international recognition. (Chaturanga Pradeep)

JO rally sends clear message to detractors: Dullas
	
The joint opposition (JO) said today the massive crowd at its May Day rally was a strong message to the embassies of Western countries and the elite class in Colombo about its strength.
JO national organiser and MP, Dullas Alahapperuma said he hoped the government would read the message and realize as to which party was the real opposition in the country.
The number of people who were present at our May Day rally was three times as big as the number of people who attended the rallies organized by the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP), the United National Party (UNP) and the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP). The people joined us as a protest against the governments oppression of the people, he told a news conference.
The MP said the rally held at the Galle Face Green was a turning point and probably the largest ever May Day rally in the country's history.
Meanwhile, he said the government should hold local government elections without delay.
If the government continues to delay elections, the people who thronged Galle Face Green will surround the key institutions in the capital, the MP said.
Referring to a challenge thrown by Minister P. Harrison that he would shave his head if the JO filled the Galle Face Green with its supporters on May Day, the MP said the challenge had been met but requested the minister not to cut his hair. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

The Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) members in the joint opposition (JO) and the members of the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) will jointly contest the upcoming elections, SLPP Chairman G.L. Peiris said today.
He told a news conference that the two parties would not contest these elections under the hand symbol of the SLFP.
Professor Peiris said people had sent a clear message at the JO May Day rally held at the Galle Face Green that they had no trust in the SLFP.
The SLFP is an appendage of the United National Party (UNP) and its policies. Today, steps are being made to convert the country's six largest corporations into private companies. Alienation and privatization are not SLFP policies, he said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

JVP in touch with  TNA, SLMC to mount  struggle for abolition of Executive Presidency
	
JVP General Secretary Tilvin Silva in an interview with Daily Mirror says his party will make a new political formation with the aim of gaining power. He speaks of geopolitical connotations involved in the Hambantota Port project and the Trincomalee Oil Tank Farm project. Excerpts of the interview: 
	No difference between the present and former rule
	
	
	Trinco Oil Tank, Hambantota Port, Economic Nerve Centres not to be alienated
	
	
	Both regimes riddled with rampant corruption, frauds
	
Q In the context of current political developments, how does the JVP plan for
its activities 
As for the current situation, we find several issues. The economy has virtually collapsed. The govt is embroiled in a serious financial crisis. It is now opting to auction off the national assets of the country as a way out of this crisis. The Hambantota Port and the adjacent lands, the East Terminal of the Colombo Port, the Trincomalee Oil Tank Farm are earmarked for selling off. Apart from the Economic and Technology Co-operation Agreement (ETCA) to be signed, the govt has inked yet another Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with India outlining projects to be assigned to India. We are not opposed to mutually beneficial bilateral agreements. Yet, we are against such agreements which are disadvantageous to the interests of Sri Lanka. We do not accept the attempts by the govt to make easy money by selling off the national assets. The JVP has initiated a struggle against this. 
In the meantime, the govt is now trying to repress the public upsurge against it. In one instance, the govt tried to limit protest and demonstrations to a site specified for it. The govt is trying to use force against those protesting against garbage disposal in their localities. Now, we learnt of yet another attempt to create a force to deal with emergency situations to be triggered by strike actions. Then, the democracy is at stake. 
Though the govt promised to abolish executive presidency, it seems to be abdicating its responsibility in this regard now. For the abolition of executive presidency, we initiated a dialogue with the like-minded parties. We have held talks with Sri Lanka Muslim Congress (SLMC), the Tamil National Alliance (TNA) and with the Communist Party. We intend to have talks with the President soon. Governance, by one party after another since Independence, has failed to address issues of our country. We need a novel form of governance and we will work for it. 


"The Joint Opposition moved a No confidence motion against Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake. The JVP also voted for it along with the JO. But MR did not vote. Literally, the MR clan had acted to safeguard the govt, not us, in spite of lashing criticism in public against the incumbent regime"

Q When abolishing executive presidency, there is concern that it would affect the unitary status of the country. It is argued that the loss of Executive Presidents hold on the PCs would lead to separatism gradually. How does the JVP see it 
It is not a correct argument as we see. Then, the President, the Prime Minister and the other forces that rallied behind to unseat the former rule, should have seen such a danger before. The abolition of executive presidency is a key election pledge. It is not the amendments the executive presidency that was promised. Actually, the executive presidency cannot protect the country from being partitioned. In fact, separatism raised its head when the country was ruled by executive presidency. The country is safe from separatism as long as people are empowered, democracy strengthened and ethnic harmony fostered. We reject claims for retaining executive presidency by trotting out such excuses. 
Q However, if the executive power in appointing provincial governors is taken out, it will give more independence to the PCs paving way for them to become independent units as argued by some government leaders. How do you see it 
If a new Constitution is introduced, a set of provisions will have to be incorporated to prevent the country from being partitioned at any cost. In the present Constitution, there is no provision to take action in case a PC declares independence. We need new constitutional safeguards to prevent the division of the country. It has to be vested with Parliament. 
Q How does the JVP see eye-to-eye on this issue with the SLMC and the TNA 
We have discussed the basic points. There is no broad discussion. This is the best opportunity to work out a new Constitution to strengthen democracy and to ensure peoples rights. All the parties should strive to reach common stand rather than sticking to their guns. 
Q The JVP, right from its inception, advocated decentralization of administrative power, but not power devolution. Have you deviated from this position in this manner 
There is no change in our policy. We are against any move that leads to the division of the country. Yet, we have to ensure equal rights for all citizens to ensure stability of the country. Rather than making way for the partition of the country, we have to decentralize administrative powers to the lowest possible level.
We have to work out something in keeping with that fundamental position. At the same time, equal rights should be guaranteed for all. 
Q How does the JVP subscribe to the Constitution making process in the Steering Committee 
We are a party to it. It has discussed matters both acceptable and unacceptable to us. We believe in bilateral talks with the political parties to identify areas with common position. 
Q There are moves for privatization of national assets as you said earlier. This is against the core of the JVP policy. But, there is public perception that the JVPs role in thwarting such attempts by the govt are minimal. How doyou respond 
There are two opinions here. The extremist forces against us accuse us of involving less in this struggle. The govt, on the other hand, accuses us of being oppositional to everything. In reality, and in the past, the JVP stood against the govts move to sell out state assets. In fact, we have managed to pre-empt such moves.
We launched the biggest protest against the move to lease out 15,000 acres of land in Hambantota for Chinese companies. We led from the front against the project to hand over a stake of the Hambantota Port. The govt backtracked from its position afterwards. The JVP trade unions were at the forefront against the proposals to lease out the Trincomalee OilTank Farm.

Q How certain are you that the govt would not forge ahead with the signing of agreements to implement its projects in Hambantota and Trincomalee involving China and India 
We want the govt to stop it. For that, we will make every possible effort. Actually, the country is going through an acute financial crisis. Our manufacturing base is lost.
These are, in fact, the assets to be utilized to boost our manufacturing base. If we sell them off to foreign powers, the situation would be compounded worse. If we develop the Trincomalee Oil Tank Farm, we would be able to reduce our fuel distribution cost. Now, plans are in place to sell it to India. Indian Oil Company is involved in fuel distribution here. So for India, it is useful. But it is important that we should build
our economy. 
QDo you see this as part of Indian expansionism once your party had espoused 
This is a policy issue concerning Sri Lanka. We have to look at it that way rather than blaming India. India is actively expanding its trading with the rest of the world. We should also have a policy to get maximum benefit for the country. We should not formulate policies that are in line with other countries. Then, they will have the advantage, not us. We do not have inherent enmity with India otherwise. 
Q In terms of geopolitics and also from the JVPs perspective, how detrimental is it for Sri Lanka to have the Hambantota Port leased out to China and Trincomalee Oil Tanks to India
In fact, these are assets connected with national security. These projects cannot be compared with other investments such as garment factories and tea industry. The port is an economic nerve centre with a bearing on national security. Likewise, the Trincomalee Port and the petroleum project will definitely have a bearing, not only on economy but also on national security. Energy sector is the most powerful economic tool connected with national security. It should be kept fully within SLs control. It should not be alienated. Economic nerve centres should never be alienated to a foreign power. 


"Actually, the executive presidency cannot protect the country from being partitioned. In fact, separatism raised its head when the country was ruled by executive presidency. The country is safe from separatism as long as people are empowered, democracy strengthened and ethnic harmony fostered."

Q The JVP played a pivotal role in installing this govt. How do you compare this regime with its predecessors 
It is true that the JVP played a key role and it was accepted by a majority of people as 6.2 million people voted against Mahinda Rajapaksa. It was part of our struggle. The next struggle is to form a progressive govt by defeating the current regime. When compared, we do not see much of a difference between the present and the former regimes in most aspects. Only difference is that this govt is fragile. The former rule had central control. The President, the PM and the Cabinet belonged to the same party at that time. Today, it is different. The President is from one party and the PM from another. As a result, there is no strong decision-making. At the beginning, the govt was less repressive. It is now attempting to suppress dissent against it. The previous govt resorted to privatization, and the current regime does the same too. Both the govts went for borrowings. We find corruption and frauds under both the regimes. However, there is some breathing space in terms of democracy under the new govt. It is also shrinking now. 
Q Traditionally, there are two main parties that had ruled this country. One could be ousted from power with the support of the other only. Then, how could the JVP form a new govt independent of thesetwo parties 
The political situation is building in favour of a different force, as we see. Only the capitalist parties called the shots. When one capitalist party was in power, another capitalist party was the main opposition.
Today, both the main parties are in the govt. Then, only the opposition parties can get together to unseat the govt. The MR group cannot attract people again. As a result, the JVP is ready to fill the vacuum. We will make a political formation. It is not a mere political party. It will be a combination of all stakeholders - academics, professionals, artistes and others. 
Q There is a public perception that the JVP chooses political strategies in a manner that is advantageous to the UNP. Your party tends to criticize the MR faction more aggressively while trying to protect the UNP-led govt. How true it is 
It is not true. It is an allegation made by the Rajapaksa gang. We built criticism against the MR rule and it cannot cleanse itself of its past wrongdoings. Alongside, we have logically built criticism against the present rule. Only the JVP exposed the Central Bank Bond scam to the country first. The COPE investigations were done successfully under the chairmanship of JVP MP Sunil Handunnetti. 
The Joint Opposition moved a No confidence motion against Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake. The JVP also voted for it along with the JO. But MR did not vote. Literally, the MR clan had acted to safeguard the govt, not us, in spite of lashing criticism in public against the incumbent regime.

SLTB also to strike over SAITM
	
Sri Lanka Transport Board (SLTB) has threatened to stop work on Friday (5) over what it claims as a move to privatize higher education system by recognizing SAITM as a degree awarding medical institution, the SLTB Joint Trade Union Alliance said.
It rejected the efforts of a powerful minister to establish private institutions in the country and said those institutions will sabotage the State Universities.
Expressing his views on this matter the All Ceylon Transport Employees Association General Secretary Sepala Liyanage said it was not possible to produce a doctor just like producing a bus driver or a conductor which was the reason behind entering to an alliance with the Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA).

## Title: Tightening margins weigh down on LB Finances March profit; but full-year net up 5%

Tightening margins weigh down on LB Finances March profit; but full-year net up 5%
	
LB Finance PLC, a licensed finance company that mainly engages in three-wheeler and two-wheeler leasing, saw its margins negatively affected during its March quarter as the rates on such leases climbed substantially.
Tightening of margins was clearly demonstrated by the interest expenses, which rose at the twice the rate of interest income.
As a result, the company saw its net profit for the quarter ended March 31, 2017 (4Q17) falling by 15 percent to a little over a billion rupees while the higher tax liability also dented the bottom line.
The financial services value-added tax rose sharply by 93 percent to Rs.349 million while the corporate income tax liability for the quarter rose by little under 60 percent to Rs.457 million from a year ago.
Meanwhile, for the year ended March 31, 2017, the company increased its net profit by 5.0 percent to Rs.3.9 billion, but the above factors weighed on the bottom line.
The return on equity also fell sharply to 33.93 percent from 40.52 percent a year ago. 
According to the interim results released by the company, with an asset base of just under Rs.103 billion, its leasing and hire purchase book expanded by a strong Rs.10.5 billion for the 12 months to March 31, 2017, albeit down from Rs.11.7 billion granted during the previous year.
During the 4Q17, the company however disbursed Rs.3.0 billion in leasesRs.12.0 billion if annualizeddemonstrating the recent credit restrictions of vehicle leasing and higher interest rates almost having no impact on new lending. 
The Central Bank has imposed higher down payments up to 75 percent for three-wheelers and 50 percent for motorcars in a targeted move to restrict the influx of motor vehicles into the country and also to curb credit flows into unproductive segments in the economy. These measures were expected to have a direct impact on companies such as LB Finance but the performance proved otherwise, at least during the 4Q17 quarter, although the vehicle imports fell substantially. 
Meanwhile, the loans and receivables rose sharply to Rs.7.0 billion from Rs.4.3 billion last year.
Customer deposits rose by Rs.7.0 during the year, down from about Rs.8.0 billion last year. By end-March 31, 2017, Dhammika Perera in concert with Vallibel One PLC and Royal Ceramics Lanka PLC, held a 78.1 percent stake in LB Finance.
Meanwhile, SBI Ven Holdings Pte Ltd, part of Japans SBI Holdings, Inc., held a 1.155 percent stake being the fourth largest shareholder.
