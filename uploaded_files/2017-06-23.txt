ComBank relaunches ?Millionaire Account?
	
Commercial Bank of Ceylon has relaunched its popular ?Millionaire Account? to enable a larger group of aspiring savers to open accounts and benefit from its unique structure.
The bank said it would now allow customers to build up a minimum balance of Rs.500,000 instead of Rs.1 million as originally envisaged or multiples of Rs.500,000 with no upper limit on the targeted investment. The holders of Commercial Bank Millionaire Accounts will also be eligible to borrow an equivalent of up to 75 percent of their account balances, a new feature introduced with the relaunch of the product. Originally launched in 2015 as an aspiration-linked investment plan that enables account holders to build up a target amount within a specific period without a high initial investment, the Commercial Bank Millionaire Account is designed principally to cater to a segment that needs to fast track savings for specific purposes such as the purchase of assets, children?s or own education or weddings. The product is a flexible, easy to manage investment plan that generates expected returns within a targeted period of time.
It guarantees the depositor a balance of Rs.500,000 or multiples of Rs.500,000 in two, three, four, five or six years, depending on how much he or she is willing to deposit each month.
Available to any Sri Lankan over 18 years of age, the Commercial Bank Millionaire Account that generates a balance of Rs.500,000 in two years requires a monthly deposit of Rs.19,155 per month. A deposit of double that ? Rs.38,310 per month ? over two years guarantees the depositor a balance of Rs.1 million.
Depositors can nominate beneficiaries to receive the total amount invested without any penalty charge, in the event of their demise before maturity.
Sri Lanka?s largest and most profitable private bank and the country?s most-awarded financial institution, Commercial Bank plays a significant role in the national economy. The bank accounted for 4.31 percent of the total market capitalisation of the Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) in 2016 with a market capitalisation of US $ 790 million at the end of the year.?
The bank is the largest lender in Sri Lanka to SMEs, having disbursed Rs.952 billion to the sector over the past five years and channels 17.82 percent of the country?s export volumes and 8.36 percent of its import volumes. For FY 2016, Commercial Bank reported assets of Rs.1.012 trillion, gross income of Rs.93.143 billion, net profit of Rs.14.513 billion, a deposits base of Rs.739.563 billion and a loan book of Rs.633.391 billion.

Cuppa leaves GMOA doctor in hospital
	
A doctor of the Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) was admitted to the National Hospital last evening with injuries to his nose after being hit on the face by a cup thrown at him by a fellow doctor during a forum held at the Sri Lanka Foundation Institute (SLFI) over the SAITM issue.
The National Hospital Police said a complaint had been lodged by the injured doctor to that effect.
Sources said that the injured doctor was attached to the National Hospital. Both the Maradana and Cinnamon Gardens Police stations are carrying out investigations into the incident.
The incident had occurred during the tea break of a discussion entitled ?Let?s conclude the SAITM conflict? which commenced at 1.30 pm yesterday at the SLFI.
It was reported that an argument had taken place among two groups of doctors over the SAITM issue resulting in fracas.
However, when contacted, the GMOA refuted the news report and said no doctor was assaulted at the forum and all the doctors present at the event held one opinion over the SAITM.
?All the doctors at the event were GMOA members and all are against the SAITM. A teacup of a doctor, who was standing, had fallen on to the nose of another doctor who was having his tea seated. That?s how the doctor?s nose was injured. No clash took place at the event,? GMOA Assistant Secretary Dr. Nalinda Herath told Daily Mirror. (Lahiru Pothmulla and Darshana Sanjeewa)

DFCC Bank recognised at ADFIAP Awards for SME development
	
?
At the recent ADFIAP (Association of Development Financing Institutions in Asia and Pacific) Awards Night held in Macau, DFCC Bank won an award under the SME Development category for setting up a specialised unit for development of micro and small medium enterprises (MSMEs).
In addition, DFCC Bank was recognised for being a Charter Member of the ADFIAP since October 1, 1976, at this event.?
The ADFIAP Awards are held to honour the members that have contributed significantly to the development of their respective countries. Founded in 1976, ADFIAP has currently 131 member institutions in 45 countries and has proved to be a key contributor to promoting development finance in the Asia Pacific region amongst the members from the respective countries.?
Commenting on the ADIFAP recognition, DFCC Bank CEO Arjun Fernando said, ?DFCC Bank values its membership of ADFIAP, a premier association which has done a yeoman service in promoting the cause of small and medium enterprises in the Asia Pacific region. We take pride in being awarded under the SME Development category for setting up a specialised unit for development of MSMEs.?
We have upheld this commitment to our common goals as a member by supporting and developing the small and medium sector in Sri Lanka through financing and technical inputs. Despite our evolution into a fully-fledged commercial bank, development banking remains at the core of our operations, as we empower a multitude of grassroots level enterprises with the tools to succeed by way of our unique products and services geared to fulfil their unique needs.?
A founder member of the association, DFCC Bank has demonstrated a long and proven track record of nurturing small businesses from early and often risky stages - to developing them into mature and profitable institutions. Clients in the small enterprise business category have unique financial requirements and DFCC is well positioned to customise financial solutions to fulfil those requirements.?
DFCC set up a MSME unit in September 2016 to assist and develop such enterprises. This unit exclusively deals with SBEs (incubators that eventually become SMEs) and provides assistance for all their microfinancing needs.?
The bank also recently launched ?Vardhana Sahaya?, a new product for the small enterprise sector offering a range of financial services including loans, leases and bank guarantees, providing a one-stop financial solution for small enterprises. The salient benefit of the Vardhana Sahaya product for small enterprise customers is that DFCC, given its strong credentials in small and medium enterprise financing, will offer customised and flexible financial solutions aptly suited to customer requirements. In addition to providing financial assistance, the bank also provides advisory services and value addition through entrepreneur development programmes across the country.

Health services at standstill for second day
	
Healthcare services countrywide came to standstill today as a result of the work stoppage by the members of the Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) over the SAITM issue.
GMOA Assistant Secretary Nalinda Herath told a news conference that they would not day their trade union action was until the government accedes to their demands on the SAITM issue.
?This strike will only be successful when we win this battle. Minister Rajitha Senaratne has said the government will take tough action against the striking doctors. We will be forced to toughen our stance if he does so,? he said.
Dr. Herath rejected allegations made by the minister that the doctors would be held responsible if anything untoward happens in the fight against dengue and said government doctors would continue treating dengue patients considering it as an emergency situation.
Meanwhile, GMOA Media Spokesman Samantha Ananda said the final phase of the battle against SAITM has now arrived and that the government should resolve this matter without further delay.
He said they had made five suggestions which the government could easily implement in resolving this matter.
?According to their suggestions, the Health Minister should gazette the minimum standards of medical education and the Higher Education Minister should inform the courts that SAITM does not have the compliance certificate given by the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC). The government should stop SAITM from enrolling new students,? Dr. Ananda said.
However, the GMOA said yesterday it would continue the countrywide strike until the government addressed their demands on SAITM. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)

I will not blame Uni students for political conspiracies: Prez
	
I will not put the blame for conspiracies launched in an uncivilized political climate on university students, said President Maithripala Sirisena in Polonnaruwa yesterday.
He further said that a certain group was trying to portray the government as one that creates an unjust situation for medical students at Government Universities by withdrawing their privileges, pruning free education and trying to mislead them.
The President made this point while addressing a function held at the Polonnaruwa Lankapura Maha Vidyalaya.
Speaking further the President said that while around 250, 000 students sit the Advanced Level Examination every year only about 90, 000 qualify to enter university and out of that only about 25, 000 are admitted to local universities. In order to realize their dreams the balance students go abroad spending huge sums of money in the process.
He emphasised the fact that it was because of this that private universities should also be established in our country to offer quality education according to the standards set by the government so as to ensure that the standards are the same in both these universities and government universities alike.
Every year about 80, 000 students are forced to go abroad for their higher education, and their parents, who are in low income groups, even mortgage their properties to make this dream a reality.
The government has taken a stand that even a non-government university should be allowed to operate according to the standards accepted by the government and during the discussions I had with the university students on the SAITM issue we agreed to make several changes to the courses offered at this institution as requested by them, the President said.

Is the Govt. really scared of elections
	
Elections for local authorities should be held in four years and thus they had been scheduled to be held in 2015 and 2016
	?
	It has to be mentioned that the PAFFREL had filed a fundamental rights petition also in the Supreme Court in September last year, seeking an order for authorities to hold the local government elections
?
The debate over the holding of local government elections or not holding of it has been brought forth again, this time by the tiny dengue mosquito. With the dengue fever spreading to an unprecedented proportion claiming over 200 lives and threatening at least another 63,000, only for the last five and a half months in this year. Opposition parties, especially the Joint Opposition have renewed their agitation calling for the local government elections throughout the country. ?
They argue that disposal of garbage around the country has been crippled as there are no elected people?s representatives in municipal councils, urban councils and Pradeshiya Sabhas after their term lapsed, leaving the administration of those bodies purely in the hands of the bureaucracy that works mainly upon orders. ??
They were agitating for the holding of these elections for these local bodies since last year accusing the government for not holding the said elections for fear of defeat in light of their failure in keeping the promises given to the people during the last Presidential and Parliamentary election. Although their claim that the government fears to face the voters seemed first as a usual political vituperation, the government?s behaviour during the past one year seems to have given credence to it. ?
The Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) has also joined the Joint Opposition?s bandwagon this week. Entering into a political debate, the GMOA spokesman Dr. Samantha Ananda said on Tuesday that the solid waste management issues have erupted following the local government bodies were crippled, resulting in the current dengue epidemic situation in the country. It is well known that the powerful trade union of government doctors is in a collision course with the present government over the proposed ETCA agreement with India and especially over the government?s refusal to close down the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM) or the Malabe private medical college.
?
There are 335 local government authorities in Sri Lanka which include 23 Municipal Councils, 41 Urban Councils and 271 Pradeshiya Sabhas. Elections were held only for 330 local government bodies in 2006, but later another five new local authorities were created. Elections for the majority of these bodies, except for a few were last held in 2011 on a staggered basis or in three stages. The tenure of almost all these local government authorities has long lapsed by now. ?

There are 335 local government authorities in Sri Lanka which include 23 Municipal Councils, 41 Urban Councils and 271 Pradeshiya Sabhas. Elections were held only for 330 local government bodies in 2006, but later another five new local authorities were created
?
Elections for local authorities should be held in four years and thus they had been scheduled to be held in 2015 and 2016, a large majority being in 2015. However, an Act was passed in 2012 to change the electoral system from the Proportional Representation (PR) system to a mixed system of PR and first-past-the-post systems. The new system created a snag in holding elections in 2015, as wards had to be demarcated in areas under each local government body, under the new mixed system. ?
A National Delimitation Committee for the demarcation of wards was thus appointed in December 2012. Nevertheless, in terms of the enactment of that Act and an amendment Act adopted in the same year, the then Local Government Minister could opt to continue to have the old electoral system (PR system) in place, until the conclusion of the delimitation process. ?
However, prior to the conclusion of the delimitation process, the then Local Government Minister A. L. M. Athaullah published a Gazette Notification on January 1, 2013, which said that the provisions of the aforesaid amending Acts had come into operation fully and the previous electoral system has become defunct. ?
The report of the National Delimitation Committee which was appointed by the previous government under the Chairmanship of Jayalath Ravi Dissanayake, a SLAS officer was submitted to the Provincial Councils and Local Government Minister of the new government Faizser Musthapha on June 19, 2015. However, consequent to the publication of it, the ministry had received over 1,000 complaints claiming that the delimitation process was flawed. ??
?
It is well known that the powerful trade union of government doctors is in a collision course with the present government over the proposed ETCA agreement with India
?
Accordingly, a Cabinet sub- committee was appointed to look into the discrepancies in the demarcations of ward boundaries made by the Jayalath Dissanayake committee, followed by the Asoka Peiris committee in October 2015 for the same purpose. An all party conference was also held with the participation of the President and the Prime Minister with regard to the said issue. ?
Asoka Peiris committee had completed its task within three months and Peiris had been quoted by the Sunday Times on January 3, 2016 as expressing confidence that he could hand over the final report of the committee by the January 31 deadline. However, it was postponed and the Government Information Department said on June 22, 2016 that the Report is expected to be handed over on August 31 which was also not happened. ?
Again on December 26 Peiris had stated to the media that his report would be handed over to Minister Musthapha on the next day but again the Musthapha?s Ministry said the release of the report had been delayed owing to some administrative issues. ??
In an interview with the Sunday Lankadeepa of January 1, this year Peiris had dropped a bombshell by saying that the Minister was asking him to drag on with the report and both the main political parties were keen to delay the report. He also alleged that the ministry was not providing adequate translators as well. ??
The Minister had denied the allegations in an interview with the same paper in its next issue. Before that he had retaliated by refusing to accept the report from Peiris publicly at a media conference on January 2, the very next day Peiris?s accusation had been published, on the grounds that all five members had not signed it. ??
Interestingly, the report had not then been signed by the representatives of the two main parties, including the minister?s party UPFA which were accused by Peiris for wanting to drag on. Finally the report was handed over to the Minister on January 17 this year. ?
?
The EC was quoted this week by the PAFFREL that barring some technicalities, all issues pertaining to the staging of the LG polls had been ironed out. It has to be mentioned that the PAFFREL had filed a fundamental rights petition also in the Supreme Court in September last year, seeking an order for authorities to hold theLG elections
?
After all, in spite of the fact that the process to change the electoral system had started in 2003; necessary laws pertaining only to local government elections have been promulgated after 13 years.The Election Commission was quoted this week by the PAFFREL Executive Director Rohana Hettiarachchie saying that barring some technicalities, all issues pertaining to the staging of the LG polls had been ironed out. ?
It has to be mentioned that the PAFFREL had filed a fundamental rights petition also in the Supreme Court in September last year, seeking an order for authorities to hold the local government elections. Yet, the government has failed to announce at least a possible date for the holding of the local?
government elections. ??

Kolomthota Cultural Foundation ready to help a worthy cause
	
?
The Kolomthota Cultural Foundation was launched in 2004 by a few enthusiasts who saw a need for a dedicated platform for a myriad social service tasks. Today, it has a core group of about 50 members who organise musical concerts, seminars, and educational workshops to raise money for worthy causes.
As its president Hemantha Weerakoon puts it: ?There is a crying need at many levels of society for knowledge and physical help in sectors as diverse as health and social welfare. If another social welfare organization asks us to help, we?ll look into the matter and raise funds for them. But we are keen on aesthetic development, too, and our ?Thun Sith Gi? concert is a means of raising funds for a worthy cause through a quality offering to the public.? ?
The proceeds of this concert, which was held last week at the Bishops College auditorium, will go in aid of flood victims. It brought together three veteran singers ? Edward Jayakody, Nirosha Virajini and Bandara Athauda ? for a superb recapitulation of their musical highlights in careers going back to the 1980s and beyond. Backed by the Band Nada, with drummer, bass guitar, lead and rhythm (two semi-acoustic classical guitars), violin, keyboards, flute and saxophone, was excellent. ?
Edward Jayakody, as chatty and amiable as ever, recalled how he spent almost a decade hanging round the Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation before getting his singing break. His superbly trained voice has the ability to sound delightfully casual even when exploring serious subjects, and this is his greatest asset along with his ability to compose music, resulting in a hugely popular song repertoire which only seem to improve with age. ?
?Kerekena Rode Punchi Karaththe? is one of those memorable hits. Its theme is serious; it?s about a poor man on a hand cart pushed by his son. It was written by Cyril Samarakone, a SLTB bus conductor working in Anuradhapura, and posted to the SLBC. Luckily it was spotted by Edward Jayakody, who asked Kalani Perera to set the words to music. ?
?
Even in this serious mood, the singer?s voice is full of optimism. It?s his hallmark. He could be described as the great lyric poet, musically speaking, of his generation. Temperamentally, Edward Jayakody remains evergreen despite advancing age, because he?s by nature an optimist who sees beauty, and something worthwhile, in almost everything, and tries to elevate it to the level of art. He usually succeeds. His blend of soothing voice, poetic imagery, vivid musical texture and ?it?s going to be all right with the world? kind of sentiment is unique even among the galaxy of quality singers who made their mark in the 1970s and 1980s. ?
?
His number two song in the concert was ?Mini Mini Poda Vetewi? written by Ratna Sri Wijesinghe, and this was followed by ?Wasanthaye Api Hamuwemu Sonduriya?, surely one of the most moving love ballads in the history of Sinhala sarala gi. The lovers? usual misgivings are dispelled by their faith in the future and an unflinching romanticism. ?
?Epa Sande Obe Sina Me Reye? is exuberant and lyrical in the same positive mood. It addresses love in general terms, and says it all with an economy (in three short quatrains) which recalls the best of 19th century romantic lyric poetry. These are songs which should be studied by new generation song writers and singers who have taken over the mushrooming FM channels. Unfortunately, no such attempts seem to be made. Even a good cover of a song such as this would be a step in the right direction. But even that seems to be beyond them. Edward Jayakody has no imitators because he?s in a class of his own. ?
?
The lovers? usual misgivings are dispelled by their faith in the future and an unflinching romanticism
?
Bandara Athauda looks, and sounds, serious ? going a shade darker than Karunaratne Divulgane but stopping just short of the melancholy of a Gunadasa Kapuge. Melodically, he belongs in that group, with ties to predecessors such as Narada Dissasekara. Even his lighter attempts such as Ruwan Tharaka, which isn?t a lament but a celebration of love, leaves you a little anxious as to what might come next. The singer?s emphatic and slow rendering of each syllable in the lyrics, so regular in its meter, makes this anxiety inevitable. His style is in stark contrast to the inherent buoyance of Edward Jayakody. ?
Nirosha Virajini is a high-octave singer, and her ever recurring forays into the higher octaves look effortless. In this, her tradition goes back to Rukmani Devi, Latha Walpola, Angelene Gunathilake, Neela Wickremasinghe and Indrani Perera. But tonally she is closer to Sujatha Aththanayake than to any of them. Nirosha?s tonal range is impressive, and she is quite at home with those frequent vocal tremolos which show that classical singing is her forte. Unfortunately, just as it was for Sujatha, and unlike in India, Sri Lanka has no careers for classical singers. They must compromise with the popular song (pop or sarala gi) to make a living. ?
But Nirosha Virajini differs from any of these predecessors in her musical style. Though classically trained in the eastern style (she was named as a super-grade singer in Tamil by an Indian and Australian panel for the SLBC, and can sing in six languages), she sounds very often like a blues singer. Like Edward Jayakody, she?s talented in music composition, and it can?t be any accident that many of her songs have a jazzy feel. When that saxophone comes on in her song ?Sina wenna mata lowata penennata?, we are carried to another musical sphere away from the familiar Sinhala sarala gi format. As Kasun Kalhara once remarked, the era when one consciously forged a national identity in music is now over. Nirosha Virajini seems to be a firm believer that music should a universal language built on many syntax and grammar, all of them not necessarily eastern. ?
This feeling is strongly reinforced by her song ?Sanda Thaniyama? in which traces of country and western, folk and blues are woven together to a superb musical tapestry of magical tone colour and texture. But, no matter how good the instruments are, Nirosha?s voice hovers over them like lightning streaking over the plains. She doesn?t hold anything back. Singing the word ?Adare,? she takes the first syllable high to where eagles dare, and then glides down with the other two to soothe our nerves. It?s a virtuoso performance, and no wonder she has no imitators. Speaking of the younger generation, one can only think of Devashri de Silva and Umaria Sinhawansa who might be compared to this awesome talent, and they are more Western oriented. ?
It?s sad to end this review on an unmusical note. But it?s exasperating to see that, despite repeated requests by organizers to switch off mobile phones during a concert, there are people so neurotically hooked up to their phones that they are terrified of doing this. During the intermission, there was too, the ungainly spectacle of a solitary female security guard running after spectators, doing her best to prevent them from bringing in drinks and their fast food packets into the hall, asking very politely at first and then pleading. But there were those who openly defied her and even those who angrily tried to put her in her place.

Less people using buses now: LPBOA
	
The number of people travelling in buses have dropped by about 1,500 because of the increase in bus fares, Lanka Private Bus Owners Association (LPBOA) President Gemunu Wijeratne said today.
He said if this trend continued the transport industry would collapse and proposed that the government should introduce a formula to work out the bus fares especially when it became necessary to increase them.
Mr. Wijeratne said the drop in the value of the rupee against the US dollar has pushed up the cost of repairs, spare parts, tyres and fuel but increasing bus fares to keep abreast was not practical. "Therefore, the Government should think of a way of increasing bus fares by way of a fixed charge,? he said.
Mr. Wijeratne said the Government was not implementing the prepaid card system for paying bus fares though it was first introduced in June 2013.
He said the 'touch travel card' was promoted and implemented there would not be any issues when it came to increasing bus fares.
?I hope the government will implement the system I proposed earlier where passengers will be asked to for the length of travel instead of the sections they travel through,? Mr. Wijeratne said.
Meanwhile, travelling in air-conditioned and expressway buses will be costlier from July when bus fares will be increased by 6.28 per cent.
The increase in bus fares will apply to buses operated by the Sri Lanka Transport Board (SLTB) and the private sector. (Chaturanga Pradeep)

Mastercard Labs has reaffirmed its commitment to being pioneers of a world beyond cash by opening a new innovation showcase, housed at its new Asia Pacific headquarters.?
The space will be a new home base for Mastercard to continue developing innovative digital commerce solutions that simplify and safeguard how payments can be made for things across banks, merchants, businesses, governments and consumers around the world. ?Located in Singapore?s DUO Towers, the Mastercard innovation showcase will host numerous Fintech innovations developed by various Mastercard Labs around the world, including many that were built in Singapore and will be one of several innovation showcases located in major global cities ? including Sydney, Dubai, New York, St. Louis and London.?
The interactive innovations on display feature a range of digital payments technologies, from robotics and artificial intelligence, unattended retail and contactless payments technology, to wearables, biometrics authentications and solutions that further drive the brand?s commitment to financial inclusion. These include a payment solution for the humanoid robot Pepper, which is scheduled to be rolled out later this year; interactive chatbots and the ?Qkr!? with ?Masterpass? vending machines, which allow consumers to purchase items via a mobile application. ?
In addition to featuring key payment innovations, the Mastercard innovation showcase also provides a platform to drive regional Fintech growth through collaborative dialogue, connecting key stakeholders and shaping young talents, such as developer and API networking events, Fintech community events and start-up boot camps, university dialogue sessions as well as lab crawls.?
Since moving into the space in March, the Mastercard innovation showcase has co-innovated with more than 500 visitors from banks, schools, leadership institutes and associations, such as Financial Women?s Association Singapore (FWA) and NTUC U Future Leaders.
Since 2012, Mastercard Labs in Singapore has served as a launch pad for numerous digital innovations and products that have travelled beyond Singapore to be applied successfully in other markets both across Asia Pacific and globally.?
Financial inclusion is also a core focus of innovation by Mastercard Labs. Recently, the team in Singapore developed Masterpass QR, a safe and secure Quick Response (QR) mobile payments solution, ideal for small merchants in locations where POS systems and traditional card readers are not easily accessible.
To date, Masterpass QR has been rolled out in India, Africa, Kenya, Nigeria and Pakistan. Another key innovation supporting the business? commitment to advancing financial inclusion is the Mastercard Aid Network, an award-winning end-to-end technology solution for humanitarian aid distribution, even in the absence of telecommunications infrastructure.
Mastercard Asia Pacific Innovation Management, Digital Payments and Labs Vice President Tobias Puehse said, ?Today, our innovation showcase has already become a central hub in advancing technologies such as chatbots and biometric authentication, while also inspiring up and coming developers and students to shape the future of commerce. As a leader in digital payments, we seek to drive meaningful innovation that positively impacts all fintech stakeholders and builds a world beyond cash.??

Mount of Mars
	
Human hand ? trailblazer of human civilization ? Part 14
?
?
BY A.S. Fernando.
The Mount of Mars is two-fold. In fact, there are two Mounts of Mars in two separate locations on the palm. The elevated area located under the Mount of Mercury between the Head and the Heart Lines is called the Upper Mars or the Progressive Mars.?
The area between the Life line and the Mount of Venus is called the Lower Mars or the Regressive Mars. The centre of the palm is called the Plain of Mars.
Each area of Mars has its special influence which makes the reading of Mounts of Mars more difficult than reading other mounts.
Those on whose hands the Mounts of Mars are well developed and are more prominent than other Mounts are called Martians.
?
Leading characteristics
The leading characteristics Martians possess are courage, self-confidence, resolution and the ability to command others. Division of Martian qualities is represented by the two Mounts of Mars. Martians are fighters by nature. They are of two types: those who fight to defend themselves and those who love to fight for the fun of it or due to the natural propensity to fight.
?
Resistive power and aggressive power
Those Martians who fight to defend themselves possess the resistive power and those who love to fight possess the aggressive power. Martians who are resistive by nature have a more prominent Upper Mars and those possessing the aggressive power are identified by a more prominent Lower Mars. Those with equally developed Upper Mars and Lower Mars are both resistive and aggressive.
?
Hot-tempered
A well-developed Plain of Mars crossed with many fine lines shows that the owner is very hot tempered. This means that a person with well- developed Mounts and a Plain of Mars crossed with many fine lines is a very dangerous person whom you have to handle with care!
?
Cowards
If the Mounts of Mars are hardly noticeable on a palm, the owner is considered a coward.
?
Stature of Martians
The stature of a Martian is above the average. He is of medium height, strongly built and looks capable of looking after himself. He is energetic, generous and fond of making friends. Though resolute, he is amenable too. Opposition or inimical attitude would turn him into a fierce fighter. There are bad Martians. You find them among drunkards and criminals.

Number 2 person  and his characteristics
	
?
No: 2 symbolizes the very experience of existing as a human being on earth. Number 1 represents humankind; 2 is the sensation of being human?The Number 2 is the conscience of the contrasts of life
Number 2 people are copycats. ?They absorb what is good in pursuit of perfection
Number 2 people are receptive to influence by others, but not for guidance and improvement
Number 2 people are gentle and docile and artistic and emotional. They often allow heart to rule the head
?
?
The number 2 represents duality, division, opposition, and is considered?complementary to 1.?
?
What Number 2 represents
According to numerologists everything on earth ? the planet we live on ? is dual. ?Examples are: man and woman, day and night, hot and cold, good and evil.?
Renowned numerologist Johana Heyss says: ?? No: 2 symbolizes the very experience of existing as a human being on earth. Number 1 represents humankind; 2 is the sensation of being human?The Number 2 is the conscience of the contrasts of life??
In this article we propose to discuss the Number 2 attributes applicable to a Number 2 person.?
According to Indian numerologist Ashnobutosh Ojha, Number 2 represents anti-thesis, and it signifies a mix of positive and negative, profit and loss and male and female in the biological sphere.?
On the positive side, the Number 2 signifies agreement and creation and on the negative side, split and separation.?
The Moon reflects the light of the Sun. So is the Number 2 person. ?Number 2 people are receptive to influence by others, but not for guidance and improvement.
?
Outstanding traits of a Number 2 person?
Number 2 people are copycats. ?They absorb what is good in pursuit of perfection.
They achieve success in life thanks to outside help and patronage that they readily reach for.?
Number 2 people are gentle and docile and artistic and emotional. They often allow the heart to rule the head.?
When the Moon is strong in the horoscope, the subject becomes charming and agreeable and he/she demonstrates a spirit of co-operation and give and take. ?If the Moon is weak, the native becomes indecisive, wavering, vacillating and disagreeable.
If born during the bright fortnight or on a day closer to the full Moon day, on a Monday or the planetary hour of the Moon (Chandra Hora), the native would show the positive traits of Number 2.

People don?t dump garbage at allocated places: CMC
	
Though the Colombo Municipal Council collected garbage on a regular basis, people did not dump garbage at allocated places making the process of garbage collecting cumbersome, CMC Commissioner V. K. A. Anura said yesterday.
He said there were several piles of garbage remained in the city.
He said that the CMC had asked the assistance of the Armed Forces to raid illegal places of dumping garbage.
"Although we collect garbage on a regular basis, people do not dump garbage at appropriate places. Therefore, we have asked the forces and the Police to assist us to raid garbage dumping. So far, we have raided 111 such places and further raids will be carried out in future," the Commissioner told the Daily Mirror.
Though a considerable amount of garbage had been collected in the Colombo city during the last few days, the Daily Mirror witnessed several piles of garbage still remaining in the city.
Garbage piles have not seen at Dematagoda, Colombo 10, Colombo 03 and Manning Town in Borella. (By Sheain Fernandopulle)

Rajiv Gandhi assassin seeks mercy killing
	
Robert Pious, one of the convicts in Rajiv Gandhi assassination case, has appealed for euthanasia, the Indian Express reported yesterday.
Pious, who is serving life imprisonment in the case, on Wednesday has submitted a letter to the Puzhal prison authorities seeking permission to end his life.
In a letter to Tamil Nadu Chief Minister E. Palaniswami, he said he should be killed on grounds of mercy and his body should be handed over to his family.
Lamenting the long years served in jail, Pious added that without the hope of release, the jail sentence has become an endless, hapless journey.
Only in the case of Aruna Shanbaug, a nurse who filed a mercy killing plea after remaining in a vegetative state for 42 years as a result of sexual assault, the apex court allowed removal of her life support system.
The exception was laid down solely because the patient was in a permanent vegetative state for a long period.
Even in countries where euthanasia is legal, it is granted only to terminally ill patients.
In 1998, Pious was sentenced to life after being found guilty in the Rajiv Gandhi assassination case.
Pious, a member of the LTTE commando team, had confessed being one of key conspirators in the killing of Gandhi.
Pious had claimed that he joined the LTTE to seek revenge for the death of his child when Indian Peace Keeping Force (IPKF) was deployed in Sri Lanka by Rajiv Gandhi to maintain peace between the LTTE and the Sri-Lankans.

RTI COMMISSION LAUNCHES WEBSITE AND LOGO
	
?
Unveiling the website of the Commission (www.rticommission.lk) and its logo on Monday (19), the RTI Commission of Sri Lanka invited public feedback on Draft Guidances on Pro-active Disclosure applicable to all ministries under the globally-acclaimed RTI Act No.12 of 2016. ??
The Commission?s logo, as unveiled, consists of Sri Lanka centered in the black pupil of an eye commonly symbolizing information, held aloft by a hand. ??
Pro-active disclosure duties refer to information that must be released by Ministers in advance of the initiation of projects. Information must also in general, be released in regard to the functioning of ministries. These relate to procurement processes and disbursements under budgets in regard to both local and foreign expenses. The duties arise automatically in terms of the law and do not depend on a citizen filing an information request against a particular Public Authority.? ?
The Commission has announced on its website that it hopes to hold consultations with Public Authorities and citizens with a view to finalizing the Guidances.? ?
?Meanwhile, information available on the Commission website disclosed that the Road Development? Authority (RDA) and the Panadura Urban Council were among several Public Authorities summoned by the Commission during the hearing of its first appeals. The Commission is the primary appellate body under the Act. It is mandated to ensure that state, corporate and non-governmental perform in compliance with the law. Failure can result in the prosecution of offenders by the Commission, which is a power not in the hands of other similar bodies, excluding the Bribery and Corruption Commission.? ?
?
"Several other matters have also been listed for hearing. Among these are two RTI appeals filed by a non-governmental organization Transparency International, Sri Lanka, regarding the assets declarations of the President and the Prime Minister"
?
In several instances, the information released on the orders of the Commission concerned improper permissions given by the Public Authorities. The RDA was petitioned by a citizen in the public interest regarding an unauthorized construction on the Hakmana Road in Matara and the Panadura UC was brought before the Commission in regard to filling and construction of land in a manner that flooded surrounding areas. Included also, was an order handed down in relation to an information request filed by a public servant in regard to obtaining details of her alleged victimization by her employer.? ?
Several other matters have also been listed for hearing. Among these are two RTI appeals filed by a non-governmental organization Transparency International, Sri Lanka, regarding the assets declarations of the President and the Prime Minister.? ?
Following the hearings of the Commission attended by the appellant and the respondent Secretary to the Prime Minister and the Additional Secretary (Legal) to the President, the Commission has listed the matter for the consideration of two preliminary questions of law. These relate to TISL failing to specify the fact of its membership coming within the definition of ?a citizen? in the initial information request to the Public Authority.
Section 3 (1) of the RTI Act states that ?Subject to the provisions of Section 5 of this Act, every citizen shall have a right of access to information which is in the possession, custody or control of a public authority.? Section 43 defines a ?citizen? as??a body whether incorporated or unincorporated, if not less than three-fourths of the members of such body are citizens.? The Rules of the Commission gazetted in February 2017 state that the requirements in RTI 01 form which is the information request format can be submitted even on a blank sheet of paper but must contain the necessary details in accordance with the RTI Act.????

Serial garbage dumpers warned: You are being watched!
	
Street cameras will be set up to identify persons who dump garbage on the roadside and in public places, Minister of Provincial Councils and Local Government Faiszer Musthapha said.
At a meeting held at the ministry to formally establish a National Task Force which was established by the Ministry in order to find solutions to the prevailing garbage crisis with a view to curbing the spread of dengue, the minister warned that stern action would be taken against such individual.
Initially it was decided to link all Local Authorities in order to maintain a proper procedure during garbage disposal.
Minister Musthapha said that the Environmental Police had increased the number of mobile observation teams that were deployed for this purpose.
Accordingly, 2, 336 persons had been identified while dumping garbage on roads in a haphazard manner in the course of a day. Every home will be required to use compost bins to dispose degradable waste. The task force will take immediate steps to initiate a waste management system in universities and schools.
Minister Musthapha said that the task force will monitor waste management procedures countrywide 24 hours of the day.
Commenting on the allegation that military personnel were being deployed to collect garbage, the minister assured the public that this Government, under the leadership of the President Maithripala Sirisena, will never allow the name of our war heroes to be degraded in such a manner.

Time to rethink liquor sale on Poya Days: Mangala
	
The time has come for the country to rethink banning of liquor sales on Poya Days, Finance and Mass Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera told Parliament yesterday.
Speaking during a debate on the notifications made under Excise Ordinance in the House, the Minister said liquor sales were higher on Poya Days than the ordinary days.
"Liquor shop owners take stocks to their residences and sell them at a price which is hundred percent higher than normal," he said adding that people purchased liquor early, usually before the Poya Days, as they were fully aware that shops would to be closed.
?
?
He said the situation had become the same on the Christmas Day as well.
Further, the Minister said beer and wine should be available at an affordable price so that people would be discouraged from going for hard liquor.
?Let?s try and get rid of outdated ideologies,? he added while pointing out that the suggestions he had come out with were his personal opinions. (By Yohan Perera and Ajith Siriwardana)

The UAE operates a network of ?black sites? in war-torn Yemen, where terrorist suspects are abused and tortured, an AP investigation has found. US personnel have been involved in at least some interrogations, agency sources said. ??
There are at least 18 clandestine prisons across southern Yemen operated by the United Arab Emirates (UAE) or by Yemeni forces created and trained by the Arab nations, AP reported on Thursday. A number of the estimated 2,000 detainees there are subjected to abuse and torture and have no legal protection, sources from the agency said. ?
The US military provides lists of questions for the detainees and receives transcripts of the interrogations done at the black sites, potentially making America complicit in torture. American citizens have been directly involved in some of the interrogations, although none of the sources confirmed participation in the alleged abuses, the report said, citing several unnamed US defense officials. ?

When North becomes a ?South?  looking  for their  ?Rajapaksa?
	
?
The first 100 day ?Yahapalana? programme with extended life could only amend the Constitution for the 19th time
	?
	Post war, they were left with far more serious and sensitive issues than before the war. They were left with issues they never knew before; war crimes, crimes against humanity, transitional justice, reconciliation and accountability among many
?
?
Thanks to two ITAK leaders in Jaffna the people say, the North is being fast turned into a Tamil ?South?. Commonalities are many. It begins with playing around with the Colombo ?Yahapalana? government. Then come serious allegations on growing corruption. Next the split within TNA that was being whispered for some time. Now it comes to the streets, as with the SLFP. A sort of ?joint opposition?. One part within the TNA and another outside it. Within a few months, it?s becomes a typical SLFP. That part which is outside the TNA is acting like the Joint Opposition (JO) in Colombo. They are also now looking for a Tamil ?Rajapaksa?. A popular charismatic leader. ?
How did this come about? ??
?
Removing Wigneswaran is difficult now, as removing Rajapaksa from the SLFP. Sampanthan as leader of the TNA is in the same shoes as President Sirisena in the SLFP. Yet the political reality now is, Wigneswaran has emerged as the de facto leader of the Northern Tamil people, no different to Rajapaksa playing the same leadership role in Sinhala South
?
First is the deep seated frustration within Tamil society. They lived under every government since independence that promised but never delivered on their grievances. They believed in the Federal Party and ?Thanthai? Chelvanayakam for over two decades to bring them answers.Thereafter, they left their loyalty at the doorstep of the TULF led by Amirthalingam for answers to issues grown bigger and complex. But none was able to help them solve their issues. In fact problems aggravated under every government. Then came Prabhakaran with his LTTE promising a ?separate? Thamil Eelam State in North-East. That ?Godot? never came. Their three decade wait for Prabhakaran?s promised ?Thamil Eelam? left them once again, as devastated ?refugees? under security forces of the Colombo government. ??
Post war, they were left with far more serious and sensitive issues than before the war. They were left with issues they never knew before; war crimes, crimes against humanity, transitional justice, reconciliation and accountability among many. These war survivors needed urgent answers to what the war left for them, before taking up long grieved political issues. They needed their own land back for resettlement. They needed answers for the ?missing? in their families. They needed freedom for their youth still lying in detention without any charges. They needed unhindered social and economic space to begin life as respected, dignified citizens. They were also left without a credible political leadership. They needed one to represent them.
??
It is to this void and with this heavy baggage of a mutilated and frustrated Tamil society the TNA, dominated by ITAK, stepped into. ITAK leadership did not work with the people in repairing the dismantled social structures, for which they would have had to champion issues on the ground. Issues even the LLRC recognised and concluded urgent remedial action is necessary. The ITAK leadership knew, in the absence of any other political alternative, the Tamil people will have to vote them as representatives to all elected bodies, including parliament. They believed representative presence would make them the Tamil bargaining power. But not Rajapaksa. His project, buoyed by ?war victory? against the LTTE,was a Sinhala Buddhist hegemonic project. He thus decided what Tamil people should be given, within his Sinhala Buddhist ?development? politics. ?
?
?
With that the ITAK leadership in TNA was driven to the opposition and worked out a ?political deal? with the UNP leadership. They believed that to be their only way out. The 2015 January presidential elections saw the TNA in the anti-Rajapaksa campaign. Tamil people and the Muslim community too, voted anti-Rajapaksa, en bloc. While the Muslim community expected the new Yahapalana rule to provide a secure life with rabid Sinhala Buddhist campaigns booked for good, the Tamil society expected the ITAK leadership in TNA to settle their most pressing issues, after Rajapaksa was voted out. ?
The first 100 day ?Yahapalana? programme with extended life could only amend the Constitution for the 19th time. That too, in a very crude manner. TNA leadership with Sampanthan, a respected veteran parliamentarian, promised a total solution to Tamil issues before the end of December 2016, and appealed to the North-East Tamil voters to return the maximum number of TNA candidates to parliament at the August 2015 elections. Sampanthan wanted a very strong representative hand to bring home answers for Tamil grievances. At this election, he was given that extra strength he asked for. Tamil voters in Jaffna district in fact went to the extent of honouring his appeal to have Colombo bred, Royal College educated, Colombo resident Sumanthiran in parliament, that cost EPRLF leader Suresh Premachandran, his three times held seat in parliament. ?
?
The 2015 January presidential elections saw the TNA in the anti-Rajapaksa campaign. Tamil people and the Muslim community too, voted anti-Rajapaksa, en bloc
?
Yet to date, the ITAK leadership which is in very close collaboration with this Yahapalana government for over two and a half years, has failed miserably in providing answers to any of the issues. TNA leadership held by ITAK has thus turned out in their alienation from people, to be more a ?Colombo presence?. They, like their Sinhala counterparts in the South, now mark their presence in mainstream media, and are not seen on the ground where voters agitate for answers to their problems now almost 09 years old. These agitations and protests demanding answers needed political patronage and leadership. In the absence of ITAK leadership, it was gradually taken over by others in the TNA and in the Northern Provincial Council led by CM ?Wigneswaran. This trend grew into what is now known as Thamil People?s Council (TPC). Among others from Tamil civil society, academics and professionals, TPC includes all 03 alliance members in the TNA, other than ITAK. In present day Tamil politics, it basically reads like the SLFP without the JO in the Sinhala South. ??
?
His position that the two ministers against whom proper investigations were not held, should be further investigated had many ?spins?. They were used to justify attempts at removing him through a No Confidence motion, organised by 15 of the 30 ITAK councillors
?
In such context, Eluga Thamil rallies held in Jaffna last September and later in Batticoloa projected Northern Province CM Wigneswaran as a new Tamil leader. This new face in North and East galvanised mass support around TPC. With massive people?s participation in Jaffna, media hurried to assume a new Tamil political alliance was in the making. That sent shivers down ITAK leadership. It was no different in the South after the JO May Day rally in Galle Face.With Rajapaksa cheered as the people?s leader, SLFP and Yahapalana leaders were also uncomfortable and jittery, post Galle Face rally. All of it, as with the SLFP leadership trying to counter the ?Rajapaksa factor?, led to a widening gap between ITAK leadership and an apparent TNA faction in the Northern PC led by Wigneswaran. With differences polarising into two political camps, as with SLFP politics, Wigneswaran?s administration in the NPC was accused of corruption. A man who lived with great respect as a Supreme Court judge, Wigneswaran thus decided to investigate allegations of corruption. Sadly the three member Committee he constituted for investigation though with two retired judges, had its own hiccups. There was mention that one of the members in the committee had been earlier retained as defence lawyer against the NPC. Also that, while two ministers were found guilty and recommended to be removed with their ministry Secretaries, other two ministers were not seriously investigated into. ?
CM Wigneswaran was also far too late in taking up complaints on corruption charges against his administration. He was into conflict with the ITAK leadership already and perhaps did not want to precipitate a crisis by investigating allegations against NPC ministers who are TNA elects. Even when a Committee was belatedly constituted to investigate corruption, there was a serious lapse on the part of CM Wigneswaranin appointing a competent, independent committee of inquiry. That left him vulnerable to attacks by his rival ITAK group. His position that the two ministers against whom proper investigations were not held, should be further investigated had many ?spins? through numerous comments and statementsthat appeared in media. They were used to justifyattempts at removing him through a No Confidence motion, organised by 15 of the 30 ITAK councillors. ?
People?s politics outside NPC and ITAK was different. None of these allegations against CM Wigneswaran bothered the Northern voter. What bothered Northern voters were ITAK manipulations to remove Justice Wigneswaran from the office of CM.They did not want their main political plank removed from political power. Protests against attempts to oust Wigneswaran were therefore spontaneous and massive. So massive, Wigneswaran himself wouldn?t believe he had been a catalyst of alternate political power in Northern?Tamil politics. ?
Removing Wigneswaran is as difficult now, as removing Rajapaksa from the SLFP. Sampanthan as leader of the TNA is in the same shoes as President Sirisena in the SLFP. He had to save face and immediately worked on a compromise. Fortunately for him, Wigneswaran was also prepared to compromise. Yet the political reality now is, Wigneswaran has emerged as the de facto leader of the Northern Tamil people, no different to Rajapaksa playing the same leadership role in Sinhala South. Yet on two different and opposing political platforms. Wigneswaran emerged on a platform for far more devolved power and Rajapaksa stubbornly on a ?Unitary? State. How these scenarios would evolve would have to be seen in months not years to come. ?
