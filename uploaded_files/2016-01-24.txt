Arjuna faults FCID for summoning Mathews
	
Former world cup winning Sri Lanka cricket captain and Minister of Ports and Shipping, Arjuna Ranatunga said the summoning of Sri Lanka Cricket captain Angelo Mathews to the FCID was regrettable.
?
Since FCID officers visit the homes of politicians to record their statements and make enquires, summoning the captain of the National Cricket Team was questionable, he said.
He also said that there was a need to ask why the officer did not go to Mathews? house and record his statement there.
The minister made this comment today (24) at a ceremony at the Jaffna Central College.

President calls North to stop consuming alcohol
	
In his continuing campaign for abstinence, President Maithripala Sirisena called upon the residents of the Northern Province to stop consuming alcohol.
?There is more alcohol distributed here in the North than elsewhere in the country. Alcohol is worse than weapons of war. It destroys lives,? he said, at the ceremonial opening of the Hirdaramani Group?s latest apparel factory in Puthukudiyiruppu, Mullaitivu.
Noting that a majority of the factory workers were young, he had a directed his words at the young people.
?Young minds get distracted fast by one thing or another. But the solution to that is not alcohol,? he said.
He said the government had undertaken many programmes in the North to curtail alcohol distribution.
The leading liquor manufacturers in the country had repeatedly complained to the government that illicit liquor was being distributed in the Northern Province -- much of it with the patronage of government officials.
The warnings had been ignored until today. However, the president is also targeting legally manufactured liquor in his campaign to eradicate alcohol and drug consumption.
Excise duty, manufacturing licences and retail licences for liquor constitute a major portion of the state revenue.
Liquor sales contribute greatly towards propping up the ailing economy. The liquor industry is now resigned to a tax hike annually (in October or November). The additional income is used to shore up the budget.
The result of the constantly rising alcohol prices has been that a major proportion of the population have opted to consume illicit liquor, thus endangering their health and denying the government of revenue.
However, the president had said recently that the excise duty on liquor would not be included in the national budget from 2020 onwards -- thus reducing the government?s dependence on the income from alcohol -- as he would make the country?s taxation schemes stronger and end alcohol consumption.

Tourism Authority to probe Mirissa resorts
	
An investigation had been launched by the Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority (SLTDA) on the reports that some resorts located in the Mirissa Bay had refused to serve food or provide accommodation to locals because of their 'unruly behaviour'.
Responding to a Daily Mirror article SLTDA said it would immediately investigate into the matter and initiate appropriate action according to the direction of the Minister of Tourism Development.
Following a preliminary investigation, the Authority had found that some of the restaurants in the area were not registered under the SLTDA.
?Both the Ministry and SLTDA recognise the principle of equality and nondiscrimination in all aspects including the business of tourism and to work towards the continued growth of the tourism industry in a secure and sustainable manner in order to benefit the national economy,? the statement said.

Traffic Dept. contemplating centre lane for buses
	
	The Police Traffic Department is looking at plans to allocate the centre lane only for buses in Battaramulla, in a bid to reduce the extreme traffic congestion in the area.
	Traffic DIG Amrasiri Senarathne, speaking to the Daily Mirror said at least 475,000 motor bikes, cars and vans travel to Colombo each day. However, the number of individuals entering Colombo by 21,000 buses outweighed the number of individuals coming into the city using other modes of transport.
	"Three wheelers and bikes use the left lane and adding buses to the equation causes congestion" the DIG said.
	?We are thinking of allowing buses to use only the centre lane and to find a way for passengers to get on and off at the yellow lines,? he said. The plan was being looked at only for the Battaramulla area and not the entire city, the DIG added.
	The new rush hour traffic plan for Jayawardenapura Road and Pittala Junction along Dharmapala Mawatha was a success, he said.
	?We only allow another lane to be used for traffic leaving Colombo at the time. It was successful, there was a smooth flow of traffic,? he said.
	The new plan which began last Wednesday is implemented from 5 to 6.30 p.m. along the Jayawardenapura Road and from 4.30- 6.30 p.m at the Pittala Junction in Dharmapala Mawatha.(Darshana Sanjeewa)

US snowstorm: Mammoth blizzard shuts New York
	
	A massive snowstorm has brought much of the eastern US to a standstill, affecting some 85 million people.
	The blizzard has dumped 40in (102cm) of snow in some areas, with 11 states declaring emergencies.
	All non-essential travel is banned in New York, with officials believing it could be one of the city's worst snowstorms.
	At least 18 deaths - many from traffic accidents - have been blamed on the severe weather since Friday.
	In all, 20 states have been affected by the fierce storm.
	Tens of thousands of homes are now without power and traffic jams lasting more than 12 hours were reported in Kentucky and Pennsylvania on Saturday.
	In rural Virginia - parts of which had more than 30in of snow - there were more than 1,000 car crashes and two people died of hypothermia.
	The heaviest unofficial snowfalls recorded by mid-afternoon on Saturday included:
	In New York, travel restrictions came into effect in the city at at 14:30 (19:30 GMT), with transport being suspended and bridges shut.
	Emergency vehicles and workers carrying out repairs are being allowed to use roads - but those driving non-essential vehicles risk being arrested
	Almost all flights into the city have been cancelled.
	Mayor Bill de Blasio said up to 28in of snow might fall, making it one of the five worst winter storms in the city.
	New York's highest previous snowfall, 26.9in, was recorded in February 2006.
	"This is going to be one of those generational events, where your parents talk about how bad it was," said Ryan Maue, a meteorologist with WeatherBell Analytics.
	On the Pennsylvania Turnpike, several hundred people have been stranded in vehicles for almost a day.
	Among them are close to 250 students from the University of Mary in North Dakota. Monsignor James Shea, president of the university, told the BBC that "spirits are good and no-one is panicking".
	Further south in Kentucky, a 35-mile (56km) traffic jam has cleared, after thousands of drivers found themselves stranded overnight on Interstate 75 by heavy snow and a number of accidents.
	The Red Cross erected shelters along the highway for those left in the traffic jam.(BBC)
