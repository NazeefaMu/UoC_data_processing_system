Bitter gourd seeds cure cancer: Research
	
A research conducted by the Peradeniya University has revealed the potentiality of bitter-gourd seeds in destroying cancer cells.
Prof. Jayantha Rajapaksa of the Veterinary Faculty engaged in the research said during his one-year research it was possible to discover the Alpha Steric Fatty Acid (ASFA) contained in bitter-gourd seeds which was capable of suppressing cancer cells.
There is a general belief among people that bitter gourd has medicinal value for diabetes but they do not take its seed as food which is a medicine in whole also capable of the lowering sugar levels he assessed.
One kg of pesticide-free bitter gourd seeds costs about Rs.8,000 and eight seeds are necessary to produce one capsule of bitter gourd medicine he said. He also said this medication has no side effects and it is now being administered to patients at the Kandy General Hospital Cancer Unit and had proved success.
This innovative medicine will soon be presented to the Medical Faculty of the Peradeniya University, he added.(Nadeeka Daya Bandara)

Cigarette smuggling -- Customs on lookout for Chinese king-pin
	
The Customs Department is on high alert to track down a leading Chinese cigarette-smuggler operating in Sri Lanka and said to be linked to the detection of Chinese cigarettes at the Bandaranaike International Airport in the past three months, a senior official said.
He said the attempts to smuggle Chinese cigarettes into the country through the BIA had been masterminded by this person and that every time contraband cigarettes were detected, the mystery man is supposed to provide the funds to pay the fines.
Except for the two major detections this year, where a Chinese woman was nabbed with Chinese cigarettes worth some Rs.3 million and four Chinese workers attached to BIA runway project nabbed with cigarettes worth some Rs.6 million, four other minor smuggling attempts had been detected.
The Customs sleuths had noted that on each occasion that the cigarettes were detected the Rs.100,000 fine imposed the funds were provided by this particular Chinese who operates here.
Sources said when a smuggler is arrested he or she is permitted to leave the airport, under Customs supervision, to obtain the money to pay the fine but in these instances the suspected smuggler king-pin had approached the arrested smugglers to handover the required amount.
The Customs believe that the smuggling of Chinese cigarettes was due to the big demand for the cigarettes by the large number of Chinese working in many development projects in Sri Lanka. (Kurulu Koojana Kariyakarawana)

Crisis in parliament:  twilight of a functioning democracy
	
What is evident for all to see is that Yahapalanaya has deteriorated today into the expression of a totally autocratic culture, in Parliament and in the country at large. Across the country vital elections at grass-roots level are postponed indefinitely on the flimsiest of pretexts, while the situation in the nation?s highest legislature represents a caricature of the basic norms of a robust democracy. ??
Parliamentary proceedings in the first week of March were marred by several developments, all of them significant and some unique. ??
The Speaker suspended the Joint Opposition leader from attending parliamentary sessions for a week. Police officers were brought into the Chamber to assist in his expulsion. During Chamal Rajapaksa?s tenure as Speaker and that of W.J.M. Loku Bandara, there was turmoil in Parliament on many occasions, involving not only verbal abuse but fisticuffs, repeated interruption of proceedings, invasion of the well of Parliament followed by sit-ins extending throughout the night, removal of the Mace and display of posters within the Chamber of the House. Regrettable as these events certainly were, not on a single occasion was any parliamentarian, let alone an occupant of the front bench and the leader of a political party and parliamentary leader of the group of parties comprising the JO suspended from sittings of the House. A police presence in the Chamber was not contemplated for a moment. ??
With no parallel whatever in parliamentary history, in this or any other country, the government of the day walked out of the Chamber, signifying complete abdication of its responsibilities in the Legislature. ??
The following circumstances, presented with no embellishment, indicate the depth and gravity of the developing crisis with regard to fundamental democratic values. ??
I. ? ?Constitutional Role of the Opposition Leader?
It is taken for granted in parliamentary tradition and practice all over the world that the Opposition Leader must be seen as the head of an alternative government, an Administration in waiting, to replace the government in power. Not even the most extravagant imagination could credit Mr. R. Sampanthan, for all his sterling qualities, with this potential. ??
He leads a Party which counts no more than 16 MPs out of 225. The Tamil National Alliance, of which he is the head, polled a mere 4.6% of the national vote at the last parliamentary elections. It is difficult to recall any instance when Mr. Sampanthan raised his voice effectively in parliament against government policy, in respect of any national issue transcending matters pertaining to the Northern and Eastern Provinces. Having played an indispensable role in installing the present government in office, he is regarded by a wide spectrum of the public as an essential component of the government, resolutely committed to its continuation in power. ??
?
?
"The cardinal principle in this context is that the Speaker, as custodian of the rights of all members of the House, should not only be entirely impartial but that his objectivity should be unhesitatingly perceived and acknowledged. The perception is just as important as the reality"
?
It is, therefore, hardly surprising that Mr. Sampanthan should turn out to be the only Opposition Leader in any country at any time, to vote for a Government Budget, unreservedly and without moving any material Amendment to its contents. He also cut an incongruous figure when, as Opposition Leader, he voted in Parliament this month for the suspension from parliamentary sittings of a senior colleague sitting with him on the Opposition front bench, who had persevered in his attempts to resist encroachment by the Government on the collective rights of the Opposition. ??
By contrast, the JO, consisting of a broad coalition of parties stridently critical of the core policies of the incumbent administration, has demonstrably secured acceptance in the public mind as the authentic voice of the Opposition. Public exposure of parliamentary debates provides ample testimony to this. And yet, the incongruous reality is that the leaders of these parties are denied facilities even in terms of office equipment, secretarial assistance and logistical support, all of which are essential for them to perform adequately the duties cast upon them by the voters. It is surely repulsive to observe them in a position of dependence on the present Opposition Leader for access to these basic facilities. ??
II. ? Dimensions of the 19th Amendment?
The Speaker?s recognition of Mr. Sampanthan as Opposition Leader, flawed at its very root, assumes an even more serious dimension on account of a perspective relevant to the 19th Amendment. Indeed, it would seem that his appointment was an initiative to subvert the principal objectives of this landmark legislation. ??
One of its much trumpeted accomplishments is the creation of a Constitutional Council, the composition of which is governed by the provisions of this Amendment. The CC, which is entrusted with functions of the highest importance, including recommendations for the appointment of such key personnel as the Chief Justice, the Attorney General, the Inspector General of Police and Chairmen of the ?independent? Commissions ? consists of 10 members with the Speaker as Chairman. ??
The Prime Minister and the Opposition Leader, who are ex-officio members are vested with responsibility for identifying five others to be appointed to the CC. The Prime Minister and the Opposition Leader together with their five nominees, therefore comprise a group of seven persons, making up an overwhelming majority of the total membership of the CC. ??
The Speaker?s recognition of Mr. Sampanthan as Opposition Leader ensures that the government is comfortably able to have its nominees appointed to crucial positions in the public life of the nation. The country has seen the disastrous consequences of this state of affairs during the past two years. ??
?
?
The situation is further aggravated by the deliberate failure on the part of the CC to comply with seminal requirements of the 19th Amendment, for example, stipulation of criteria for the recommending of appointments (an obligation which the Council is compulsorily called upon to perform within three months, but has inexcusably gone by default up to now). The contrived absence of any norms or yardstick has enabled the government, acting through a pliable and accommodative Constitutional Council, to overlook when expediency demands considerations such as seniority without the assignment of any intelligible reason for a seemingly arbitrary choice. This has happened repeatedly, giving rise to growing cynicism and rapid erosion of public confidence. ??
III. ? Arithmetic of the Situation ??
The bizarre character of contemporary events is underscored by this factor. It is established principle in India that no political party is entitled to the position of Opposition Leader unless that party commands a minimum of 10% of the total number of seats in the House. The numerical strength of the TNA in Parliament is, of course, well below this threshold. ??
The absurdity of Mr. Sampanthan?s appointment is seen in sharp relief in the context of refusal by the Speaker of the Lok Sabha, upon formation of the Narendra Modi Government, to concede the post of Opposition Leader to the Congress, on the grounds that the latter did not satisfy the mandatory criterion as to its strength. By the same token, no Opposition Leader was named when Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru was sworn in as the first Prime Minister of independent India. ??
?
?
"The Speaker?s recognition of Mr. Sampanthan as Opposition Leader, flawed at its very root, assumes an even more serious dimension on account of a perspective relevant to the 19th Amendment"
?
?
IV. Incapacitation of?the JO ??
By its very nature, the joint opposition is an umbrella political grouping which embraces within it several parties, which while subscribing to a common outlook and convictions in respect of major issues, advisedly retain their distinct identity. Sustained denial of their right to articulate their separate points of view on the floor of Parliament smacks of a stubborn affront to highly visible political reality. ??
The result of this attitude has been the unwarranted withholding from these parties and their leaders of their due entitlement to adequate opportunity for participation in debates and in the work of Parliamentary Committees, as well as their right to raise urgent issues in the public interest under Standing Order 23(2), in adjournment debates and other contexts. The public were recently treated to the farcical spectacle of leaders of the JO being compelled to hold a media conference in the members? car park. ??
The thrust of these circumstances goes well beyond deprivation of the legitimate rights and privileges, as such, of MPs; it impinges crucially on the aspirations of voters who returned them to Parliament and debilitates, in vital respects, the functioning of a vibrant representative democracy. ??
V. ? An Unconvincing Policy Rationale ??
The argument repeatedly resorted to by the Speaker to explain and justify this state of things is the circumstance that all the parties comprising the JO contested the parliamentary elections under the common symbol of the betel leaf. It is claimed that this results in their necessarily having to be looked upon as an inseparable entity governed by the hierarchy of the UPFA. The SLFP is its largest component and more than one-half of its members elected to Parliament on the UPFA ticket sit and vote in Parliament as the JO. The President, who is also the leader of the SLFP, has fully acquiesced to these members functioning in the Opposition and voting against salient government measures including the Budget. Notwithstanding all this, it is contended that the SLFP hierarchy, which has entered into a Memorandum of Understanding with the UNP, has the unqualified right to exercise effective control over the decisions and actions of SLFP MPs forming part of the JO. ??
The anomaly to which this gives rise, is manifestly incompatible with established precedent in this country as well as overseas. In 1981, during a period of intense crisis within the SLFP, the elections authority determined that Mrs. Sirimavo Bandaranaike had legitimate control over the party machinery. When action was sought to be taken, on the basis of this ruling, against Maithripala Senanayake and others who constituted the rival faction, the Speaker at the time, holding that the decision by the elections authority in this regard was not binding on Parliament, insisted on appointing a Parliamentary Committee to make its own assessment. Moreover, the course of events in India during the conflict between the two wings of the Congress, one led by Indira Gandhi and the other by Kamraj and Morarji Desai, is unmistakably at variance with the reasoning underpinning the decision by the Speaker. ??
VI. ? Inspiration Derived from Precedent ??
The cardinal principle in this context is that the Speaker, as custodian of the rights of all members of the House, should not only be entirely impartial but that his objectivity should be unhesitatingly perceived and acknowledged. The perception is just as important as the reality. ??
This essential attribute of the Speaker is firmly anchored in hallowed tradition, associated as it is with the iconic figure of Speaker Lenthall. During the civil war between King Charles I and his Parliament, the monarch, in his relentless pursuit of the leaders of the parliamentary party opposed to him, went with his armed entourage, demanded entry into the Chamber of the House of Commons and insisted that the Speaker should surrender his adversaries to him. The memorable words of Speaker Lenthall have reverberated through the annals of British and Commonwealth parliamentary history. The Speaker, addressing the indignant King, declared: ?Sire, I have neither eyes to see, nor ears to hear, nor tongue to speak, except that which this House commands?. Decisively rebuffed, the King could do no more than observe prior to his ignominious retreat: ?The birds have flown?. The Speaker?s words, signifying the need for explicit manifestation of absolute independence of the Speaker of Parliament from any tinge of Executive patronage and influence, as a necessary condition for the integrity of Parliament itself, have clear resonance in our own country today. ? ??

Dharmapala Principal resigns amidst tension
	
The growing protest by students and parents of Kottawa Dharmapala College compelled its newly-appointed Principal K.K. Wijeratne to tender his resignation today, Western Province Education Director Srilal Nonis said.
The claim that the principal?s appointment being politically influenced made headlines during the recent past.
By sending a letter yesterday to the School, Sri Jayawardenapura Zonal Education Director W W N K Ekanayake had informed about the resignation of the principal and had ordered Vice Principal S. G. Premasiri to act for the Principal until a new appointment is made.
According to the All Ceylon Teachers? Union (ACTU), there had been a political influence behind Mr Wijeratne?s appointment and the appointed principal had scored fewer marks at the selection interview.
The parents who protested last Friday (17) on the issue accused that the assigned principal did not deserve the position as the Principal of Asoka Vidyalaya Y. S. Yasaratne had obtained the highest marks in the selection interview.
Commenting on the matter ACTU secretary Joseph Stalin said the Ministry should immediately intervene in the matter and stop political interference in the Education sector. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

"I am working hard but not allowed to deliver" - Harin
	
Minister of Telecommunication and Digital Infrastructure Harin Fernando said though some people accused him of disregarding his voters, he was not allowed to work despite trying hard for it.
The Minister was speaking at an occasion held on Sunday (19) in Badulla to mark the International Women's Day.
"These days, some people accuse me of disregarding those who voted. They say I am not to be seen after getting their votes. I tried my best to work for them, yet, I am not allowed to do so. I will remain patient for a couple of months and see and will either resign from this or work for you", he said.
Women members of the Ceylon Workers Congress arrived at the Baddula Post Office Complex auditorium from Muthiyangana Rajamaha Viharaya carrying slogans demanding a salary increase. He said he and Suresh had no portfolio to deliver something for the benefit of the estate sector.
"We have nothing against Minister Palani Digambaram. Yet, if we are assigned trade union activities in the plantation sector, a Cabinet portfolio is needed to work for it. Currently, we have different responsibilities. You have to bear in mind that it is the trade unions affiliated to the UNP that worked for plantation workers' rights", Minister Fernando added.(Palitha Aryawansa and Prasad Rukmal)

No reason to delay future PC elections: EC
	
Elections Commission Chairman Mahinda Deshapriya today ruled out the possibility of postponing the elections to the provincial councils when their terms end.
He said this amid speculation that the government was planning to postpone the elections to the North-Central, Sabaragamuwa and Eastern Provincial Councils whose term ends in September this year.
Mr. Desapirya said he believed that the government would be hard pressed to find some good reason to postpone these elections citing delays in delimitation. He said as Election Commission Chairman, he could take steps to hold elections after the tenure expires.
?If the government intends postponing the elections, it can only do so by enacting fresh legislation in Parliament. It is not easy to do that. I feel a referendum is needed, in addition to a two-thirds majority in Parliament because elections are linked to the franchise of the people.
In the past, the elections were postponed under the Public Security Ordinance during a state of emergency. We do not have an emergency situation in the county now,? he said.
Mr. Deshapriya also spoke at an even organized by the 'March 12 Movement' last week in Anuradhapura where he answered questions asked by the members of the audience added that politics was detested by youths involved in white-collar and labour-intensive employment.
?It is the duty of politicians to attract more youths to politics by providing a level playground,? he said. (Kelum Bandara)

Secret code ?London Bridge is down? to alert Queen's death
	
British officials will use the code words 'London Bridge is down' to inform each other the Queen has died, it emerged today.
The Queen's private secretary will reportedly call the Prime Minister with the coded message after the monarch passes away.
It will start in train a series of carefully planned events over how the death of the Head of State will be handled and reported to her public.
Queen Elizabeth, 90, has ruled for 65 years and has appeared strong and healthy in recent public appearances.
But it emerged today that civil servants have extensive plans in place for when she does pass away, with the leaders of the 36 countries for whom she is a figurehead being the first to be informed after the UK Prime Minister, the Guardian reported.
The coded phrase is understood to be in place to prevent switchboard operators getting the news before those in power.
Once each of the Commonwealth governments have been informed, the media will be told, with TV shows on BBC One, Two and Four interrupted and going to the news. Radio 4 and Radio 5 Live will also go to the news.
Both Houses of Parliament would be recalled, according to plans, which are believed to have been in place since the 1960s.
It is understood that a period 12 days of official mourning will be announced and a funeral will take place at Westminster Abbey.
Her funeral will be held 12 days after her death and she will lie in state in Westminster Hall for four days, with more than half a million people expected to visit.
Around 2,000 people will attend the funeral, before the Queen's body is taken by road to Windsor Castle, where she will be buried in the Royal Vault.
Prince Charles would become King and the current Duke of Cambridge, Prince William, would become the Prince of Wales.
Despite the report of the plans being published today, the Queen is said to be fit and healthy and was in good spirits when she attended a Commonwealth Day service earlier this week.
She also has a busy diary of events over the coming months, including opening the new headquarters of the Met Police next week, visiting the Chelsea Flower Show in May and taking a salute in her birthday parade in June.
Today she attended the reopening of the National Army Museum in Chelsea, where she wore a blue tweed coat and matching hat. (Daily Mail)

The police said that Julie Ann Warner (36), a tourist guide, has confessed that she became a carrier after meeting a Sri Lankan agent, Logorajan, six months ago.
Warner and three other Britishers were arrested at Sahar airport in Mumbai on March 15 for allegedly helping four Lankans migrate to the UK, using forged passports.
Senior inspector of Sahar police station, BT Mukhedkar, said that the UK nationals were "not cooperating" in the probe.
The police said that agents wanted in the case had demanded Rs17 lakh each from the Lankans to help them reach the UK with fake passports which identified them as the four arrested UK nationals.

Public prosecutor Neeta Masarkar said that the fake Indian passports had fake immigration stamps. Counsel for the British nationals, Prabhakar Tripathi, said that his clients were victims as the agents had duped them.(TOI)

When you?re in a garden which flowers do you pick first? The most beautiful ones...
	
Today is the 75th Birth anniversary of Gamini Dissanayake
Is this the reason why many good people die early? March 20th is my fathers birthday. He would have been 75 had he lived. He was a wonderful father and a wonderful husband but most of all he was a wonderful human being. ??
It has been 23 years since my father?s untimely death and despite the time, he is always in my heart and mind. Time is supposed to heal all wounds but yet this wound has not healed. How can it? He was my world. I seldom show my emotions, I talk a few words but yet my mind is far too active. Its activity crosses all time spans - Night and Day. My thoughts go to him. I yearn for his presence and his love and guidance. Through my fathers untimely death both my brother and I were driven to politics at a very early age. There was no choice but a necessity. Even whilst he was living and engaged in politics, we as a family supported him throughout and we were on the field. Our father however never expected us to follow in his footsteps and enter politics. He was not a believer in family dynasties. His advise to us was, whatever career path you choose it has to be done by your own merits. ?I will not prop you up. You have to stand on your own two feet.? How valuable this advise was. ??
?
?
The name Gamini Dissanayake is synonymous with the Accelerated Mahaweli Development Project for he established the foundation of the largest ever multi-purpose national development programme in the history of Sri Lanka. He was identified as a people?s leader and in his short span of life, rendered a considerable service to the country especially the rural poor and the plantation sector community. My father entered Parliament as a UNP MP under former Prime Minister Dudley Senanayake, having won the Nuwara Eliya - Maskeliya seat at the crucial 1970 general elections which saw many UNP stalwarts losing their electoral ?citadels?. He was among the 18 UNP MPs who won their seats when the party suffered a surprise overwhelming defeat at the election. ??
He easily secured his seat in the 1977 general elections which brought the UNP back to power under the far-sighted leadership of President J. R. Jayewardene and was appointed as Minister of Irrigation, Power and Highways, which was held by Maithripala Senanayake under the Premiership of Sirimavo Bandaranaike. Later, Following the launch of the Mahaweli development project by the Jayewardene government he became the Mahaweli and Mahaweli Development Minister aimed at completing the entire project in six years which was earlier earmarked to be completed in 30 years. My father also served as Plantation Industries Minister during President Premadasa?s regime. ??
It is indeed a nostalgic experience for me to be holding the same portfolio he held 25 years ago as Minister of plantation Industries. The beginning of my political journey holding a portfolio was also as deputy minister for plantation industries. ??
?
?
Not a day goes by that I don?t think of my father. He was my world and my mentor. My world shattered the day he lost his life and it was my mother who gave me the strength to face his untimely death. We all lose our parents one day and as an adult and with two daughters of my own, I understand this very well. But to lose him at such a tender age, in tragic circumstances never leaves you. ??
On my parent?s advise I left Sri Lanka at a tender age of 15 years and was sent to Australia to a boarding school. The experience of boarding school was very unpleasant for me, new surrounding, new cultures and most of all I missed my father and the long discussions we had. As a 15-year-old my interests were very different to the others of my age. We discussed about taking the country forward, what areas need development and strengthening and where we fail. Recently I spent many hours going through the letters that were exchanged between my father and me. What sound advise he gave me and how he explained the art of politics to me. He was a politician to the core, who loved people. There was genuine love flowing from him whenever he sees someone. He remembers their name. ??
He remembers their story. How can he remember so much I always used to wonder? And the answer is simple. He cared about them. He wanted to help them. My brother and I were so absorbed and moved by the love and respect people had for him. ??
His ideologies, he had so many years ago, were so far fetched. He believed in sound education and that English and IT were the tools of power. How true it is now to the modern world. This ?was the main reason for setting up the Gamini Dissanayake Foundation and setting up the institute for teaching the much needed English and IT to rural students?. ??
?If Gamini were alive.? How many times I have heard this echoing in my ears, said by many people. If he was alive I would have had a father, as well as my brother and sister. My mother would have had a husband. The love of a family is the most precious gift and this was stolen from us the day he parted. Our grieving processes are different and my grief I keep locked in my heart. The fateful day he departed is still a memory that is so vivid. He was dressed in his usual national costume, with hair neatly combed. I went to his room and asked ??
?Appachchi, how is it going?? ??
He said, ?Yes, I can win it!? ??
His voice was filled with certainty and determination. These words are still ringing in my ears and these words I can never forget. That was the last time I saw him - in the upstairs room in our house in Kandy. He was so determined. This happened in the morning and he was killed in the night. I remember that face. He was ready for a fight and was never going to give up. ??
When I think of this day, I always wonder was he hasty in his decision? Should he have contested at that time? But this is our destiny, his destiny and the country?s destiny. ??
June 20, 2016 was a day that filled me with so much happiness. This was the day that I was able to be part of fulfilling my fathers?s wish of completing the Mahaweli Seya. This one single act that gave me much peace and tranquility. ??
This was done for my father. The foundation stone was laid during his time and the completion took 33 years. I spend many hours at the Seya sitting on the grounds absorbing the calm serene surrounding where I feel his presence. This takes me away from an array of tasks that I perform on a daily basis. The state of calmness that I am able to achieve takes me away from the pains of this world. I feel my father?s presence amidst the Mahaweli Seya?s surrounding and this alone is enough.
?
?
"On my parent?s advise I left Sri Lanka at a tender age of 15 years and was sent to Australia to a boarding school"
?
??
On this day his 77th birthday I wish him to attain the supreme bliss of Nirvana, even though my heart yearns for his birth again as my father, this yearning will only lengthen this journey in Samsara. I learnt so much from him during his short but productive life. I will never be able to be another Gamini Dissanayake in this political era but I strive hard to be like him. I am his son and with that advantage I will tread this life doing my duties to the best of my ability so that I will serve society and help make Sri Lanka a better country for our future generations. This is what he would have wanted from his sons. ??
