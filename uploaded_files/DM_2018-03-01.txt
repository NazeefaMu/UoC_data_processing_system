A Profound state of mindfulness
	
The closing line of the monumental treatise Visuddhi Magga on the chapter on Mindfulness of Death is considered apt to open the essay. One who is devoted to this mindfulness is constantly diligent, acquires a perception of disenchantment with all forms of existence and overcomes attachment to life. He abhors evil, abandons greed of things and is free of avarice about requisites. The perception of impermanence becomes familiar to him followed by perceptions of unsatisfactory nature of all conditioned phenomena and of non-self. 
Those who have not developed this type of mindfulness are seized by horror and turmoil at the final moment of their lives as if confronted by wild beasts, demons, venomous snakes, robbers and murderers whereas those who have, pass away peacefully. If the deathless state is not achieved here and now, he is headed for a happy state upon break-up of the body. 
Conceivably there is nothing more disagreeable and disturbing to the untrained mind than the prospect of having to face death some day, hence it is a topic best left alone. Salla Sutta quotes Gautama Buddhas succinct words on the point. Living beings constantly fear death just as ripe fruits of the trees that fear their fall at break of dawn ...... In the midst of weeping of relatives and ranting of onlookers Mara takes away one by one as does a butcher the cattle...... Infants and the feeble, fools and the wise, they all come under the spell of Mara...... 
The girl attained the state of Sowanhood. No sooner she went to the weaving hall she fell dead as a result of a sharp strike from the very spool she carried, caused by a sudden involuntary movement of her fathers arm
The weavers daughter
The meditative practice is by no means confined to the aged and the sick, neither to an auspicious time or day. Once at Aggaalawa Chethiya, Anlaunuwara, Gautama Buddha preached a sermon on the enormous benefits of this particular meditation as to how a non-practitioner would die making hideous noises as if seen a poisonous snake, whereas a practitioner, who like a man having seeing a cobra at a distance, would throw it away with a stick. Mesmerized by the wonder of the sermon, a sixteen-year-old weavers daughter began practising it day and night whereas a majority of the listeners went about their chores as usual.
Three years later on a particular day, when the Blessed One entered the realm of limitless compassion before dawn to survey the world as was His practice, the weavers daughter fell within the net of wisdom. It was her last day on earth. 
If he visits Aggaalawa she would attain Sowanhood and be born in Thusitha; if not she would face an uncertain death. In such a scenario a Samma Sambuddha would travel to the end of the universe for the individuals deliverance. Accompanied by five hundred bhikkhus, he left Jetawanaramaya to arrive at Aggaalawa Chethiya. Having heard of the Blessed Ones arrival, the girl was elated that after three long years she was to witness the resplendent face and golden body again and be able to listen to sweet Dhamma. However she had an urgent task to perform and the punishment would be severe if she failed. Her father had entrusted her to wind a spool of thread and be brought to the weaving shed before noon that day without fail. 
In the meantime Buddha had finished His midday meal and the people of Alaunuwara were eagerly awaiting His sermon. He had walked thirty yojanas for a particular purpose, so He remained silent until that moment arrived. When a Buddha remains silent, none in the world including gods can do anything about it. At last the girl carrying the thread arrived and stood at the end of the congregation gazing at Gautama Buddha. When the Enlightened One acknowledged her with a turn of His head, she knew He wanted her to come forward, so she walked directly into the aura of six coloured splendorous rays surrounding the Great Being and worshiped him. 
Breaking the solemn silence He addressed her, Girl, where did you come from Lord, I do not know. Where are you bound for Lord, I do not know. Do you then not know I do know, Lord. Then you do know, do you No, I do not, Lord. There was a great commotion within the crowd over her flippancy. Having subdued the gathering, Gautama Buddha called upon the girl to clarify her answers. She explained that Gautama Buddha was well aware of her movements on the ground, but what He meant was, where she came from into this world and whither she was bound, from here. As to her third and fourth answers she explained she was acutely conscious of her death, but knew not whether in the morning, noon or at night. Gautama Buddha expressed. 
The girl attained the state of Sowanhood. No sooner she went to the weaving hall she fell dead as a result of a sharp strike from the very spool she carried, caused by a sudden involuntary movement of her fathers arm. Overcome with bitter grief, the father sought solace from Gautama Buddha and entered the Order.
Dwelling on the subject is not an exercise exclusive to a Buddha era; the extent to which Boddhisatvas and others developed the practice in non-Buddhist eras is fascinating, to say the least
The Brahmin farmer
Dwelling on the subject is not an exercise exclusive to a Buddha era; the extent to which Boddhisatvas and others developed the practice in non-Buddhist eras is fascinating, to say the least. The Noble Truths however, are non-existent. Gautama Buddha once had an occasion to narrate this incident to a person inconsolably grieving over his dead son. In the hazy past Gautama Buddha was a Brahmin farmer who with his wife, son, daughter, daughter-in-law and the house maid were avid practitioners of this particular form of mindfulness. Whilst working on the field, the son underwent instant death due to snakebite, whereupon the Bodhisatva father sent word home through a passerby that only one packet of lunch be brought that day. The inmates immediately grasped the situation and proceeded to the field dressed in white, carrying with them perfume, flowers and the single parcel of food.
Having eaten the food under the same tree where the dead body lay, the Brahmin along with the other four gathered firewood and started burning the body. Sakkha, the king of Thavathimsa Gods, wishing them to perform the lions roar on contemplation of death descended on the field to inquire from the Brahmin what was being burnt there. A dead body said the Brahmin. Is it a wild animal for meat or an enemy My own son whom I used to carry on my shoulder. Must have become a stubborn one, so you have no remorse at all. The Bodhisatta replied, As the reptile that has no love for the skin it has shed, so my son who died of karmic force has no attachment to his corpse. He knows not its being burnt. What purpose should we weep for Sakkha then turned to the Brahmin wife who said that she had carried him in her womb.
Why arent you then crying and weeping Her answer to the god in verse, appears in Uraga Jathaka. 
Uncalled he hither came, 
Unbidden soon to go. 
Een as he came he went, 
What cause is there for woe 
The sons wife, daughter and the maid offered equally sagacious answers in their turn, whereupon the king of gods applauded their absolute mastery of the particular concentration and rewarded them with enormous material wealth. The maid was born as Kujjuthathra in the dispensation of Gautama Buddha, the deceased son as Rahula Thero, the Brahmins daughter as Uppalawanna Bikkhuni and his wife as Khema Bhikkhuni. The Brahmin was Buddha Himself, He pronounced. 
The humbling nonchalance of Arahants towards this singularly crucial moment in life is almost beyond belief. The impassive, insouciant stances of the two chief disciples Sariputta and Maha Moggallana while apprising the Blessed One of their impending arrival upon the moment of extinction are two of the most sensational episodes in the whole of the scripture. 
One of the two Elder brothers of the sprawling, ancient Sithulpahuwa monastery, residence to 12000 Arahants, recited the disciplinary code of monks (Uposatha) on a full-moon day and accompanied by a community of bhikkhus went over to the walk-path near his dwelling. He inquired from his colleagues, in what poses they have seen bhikkhus pass into Parinirvana. They answered they have seen them while seated and in cross-legged position in the air. The venerable monk replied I will show you one who passes away while ambulating. He drew a line across the walk-path, went up to the farther end, turned back and passed into Parinirvana the moment his sacred feet touched the line  Visuddhi Magga. 
An extract from Bhikkhu Nanamolis preface penned in the English edition of Bhadanthacarya Buddhagoshas masterpiece was considered in order, to be produced here.  The liberating doctrine discovered by the Buddha 2500 years ago has remained untouched by all the circumstantial change undergone since then. Old cosmologies give place to new; but the questions of consciousness, of pain and death, of responsibility for acts, of scale of values as highest of all, remain.

Four Ministers want action against Ampara violence
	
Ministers Rauff Hakeem, Mano Ganesan, Daya Gamage and Rishad Bathiudeen had urged the Government to ensure that action is taken against those responsible for communal violence in Ampara two days ago, it is learnt.
At Tuesdays Cabinet meeting, these four Ministers spoke against the violence that broke out in Ampara.
The incident was triggered by a rumour that a certain eatery was serving food mixed with birth control pills.
The Ministers said if that were the case; it should be investigated rather than violence.
They are reported to have said that the Police would know the area people responsible for the incidents. (Kelum Bandara)

India wasnt interested in SLs development projects: MR
	
Former President and MP Mahinda Rajapaksa has said that India was not interested in building ports and highway projects in Sri Lankawhen it was first offered, the Hindu said.
In response to a question on increasing interest from China in Sri Lankan projects, Mr. Rajapaksa has told reporters in Bengaluruon Wednesday on his return from Tirupathithat Sri Lanka offered development projects including ports and highwaysto India first.
However, somehow they were interested in building the port at Hambantota. The government did not want it at that time because it was war time I think. What else to do We went to China and when we mentioned about this, they immediately accepted that proposal. In any case, it was only a commercial transaction, he said.
He said that they knew how to pay it back. We knew the importance of Hambantota port. When they offered it, what is the main duty of the leader To look after the country.
Unfortunately, he said, the current government sold everything. In our policy there is no privatisation and we do not believe in privatisation. Thepresent government sold it for 99 years.
Mr. Rajapaksa said that his country had good ties with India. But India misunderstood us in the past. In fact, an Indian Ambassador had told me that India is like a teenage girl because teenage girls often misunderstand,
On further prompting, he said it was Nirupama Rao, the former Indian ambassador, who had made the comparison. While Indias external policy towards Sri Lanka is good, the former President said that some cases need discussion.
On the victory that his Sri Lanka Peoples Party attained in local body elections, Mr. Rajapaksa said We won by a majority. People have given a mandate. We had said that this is not a local government election, but a referendum against the national government. Within these three years, whatever government has messed up, people showed dissatisfaction with the government.

Jaffna Prez House to open to public
	
President Maithripala Sirisena has said he did not wish to use the Presidential super luxury abode built by former President Mahinda Rajapaksa in Kankesanthurai (KKS) at a cost of Rs. 3.5 billion and as such it could be used by Ministers, public officials and tourists at a cost, a Spokesman of the Presidential Secretariat said.
The spokesman said the super luxury Presidential Palace built by the Sri Lanka Army in 2012 with five-star accommodation and facilities on a 100-acre land could be used as a high-end tourist attraction as Jaffna did not have a five-star hotel right now.
Arrangements will be made shortly for the reservation at the facility through the Presidential Secretariat and any individual or a group is free to do so when it is opened for reservations. He added.
Meanwhile, Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said he had instructed Ministry officials not to go ahead with the proposed construction of a Circuit Bungalow near the Pesalai Jetty for the use of visiting Ministers and officials after President Sirisena decided to open the KKS Presidential Palace for the public.
I believe President Sirisena has given an opportunity to the public, tourists and public officials to use a super luxury facility for an affordable price as I think this will not be as costly as a five-star hotel facility in Colombo, Minister Amaraweera said. (Sandun A Jayasekera)

Medin Poya Reflections Buddhas Approach using Psycho - Analytic Therapy
	
Neutralised the pride of relatives; responded to anxieties of Yasodharavo and prince Nanda - The Buddha spoke with caring to Yasodharavo, telling of her boundless virtues inherited from previous lives. She had indeed offered a great backing to him. Her pureness, devotion and gentleness had been precious to the Bodhisattva when he pursued enlightenment, the highest objective of mankind, according to Buddhist teachings. And so virtuous had she been that she favoured to become the wife of a Bodhisattva.
The realities of mind are more important thanrealities of body William James - American Psychologist. 
Psycho and neuro-pathological complications are now receiving admirable attention during scientific training, exactly what the Buddha taught 26 centuries ago. Modern medicine confesses that there is an ultimate inter-dependence of mind and body at all phases of physical ailments. Buddhist teachings however, go a step further; they add more importance to mental faculties, and state that the mind is the fore-runner of all sensations and occurrences. 
King Suddhodana, was particularly concerned about meeting his son. Nine messengers carried his request to Gautama Buddha asking him to visit Kimbulwattpura. All of them became followers and stayed back at Rajagaha Nuwara. Finally, the king turned to Kaaludai, the childhood friend of Sidhuhath. Gautama Buddha left Rajagaha in a two month-voyage delivering Dhamma to inhabitants on the way, before reaching Kapilawastupura onMedin Poya day. 
Gautama Buddha, putting a bit of psychology into use, focused on the immature mind of Nanda. Gautama Buddha said that he could get him any of those nymphs as his bride, on the condition that he would not leave the monastery
Gautama Buddha had to exhibit delusionary effects to neutralize the pride of his relatives using his psychic powers, Yamamaha. The following morning the Gautama Buddhas entourage were begging for alms. At that time he had to brief about his ancestry to a shocked father who responded with objections. The king and other family seniors in the kingdom received Gautama Buddha with great reverence except Yasodharavo, the mother of Rahula. She chose to remain confined to her chambers. The most passionately focused event was the meeting between Gautama Buddha and Yasodharavo that took place at Suddodhanas palace. The king sent a message to Yasodharavo who replied in the negative. Instead, she expected Gautama Buddha to visit her chamber. 
A lesson in Psychotherapy
Surely, if I am worthy of any affection or care, Sidhuhat will come and see me  Bimbadevi
Having learned that she had turned down the request, Gautama Buddha, accompanied by his two chief disciples Sariputta and Moggallana walked into her compartment signifying his unassertive character and well-mannered regard for his former partner in samsara. 
Bimbadevi not having seen me for a long time is extremely distressed and unless you allow its natural course her heart will slash. In the event she touches me lets not prevent her, Gautama Buddha had told his disciples. She was relaxing in her room dressed in uncaring fabrics and with her hair cut. As Gautama Buddha passed the entrance of the door she was unable to hold her admiration. For a moment she failed to recall that her precious man was now a noble person. She seized his feet and wept frantically. However, seeing that the king was present, she rose. By allowing Bimbavo to spend-off her grievance in that harmless way, the enlightened one taught the world a lesson in Psychotherapy. 
Sabbe Satta Ummattaka-Gautama Buddha said it is hard to find a being in perfect bodily health, but it is indeed far more challenging to find a person who is completely mentally well- Roga Sutta [AnnguttaraNikaya]. 
Leading men in the field of psychology like Sigmund Freud, Carl Jung, Otto Rank and Adler used hypnosis as the basis for examining the cause, but gave up developing the concept of Free Association, another skill that Gautama Buddha practised as well. Gautama Buddha attached lot of importance to the development of cooperation and attachment between therapist and patient; quite a few modern psychologists have professed this line of treatment.
The two-way or dialog form sermonizing used by Gautama Buddha has a close parallel to todays psychiatric approach to mental patients. Buddhist psychotherapy cures mental sicknesses and enables understanding of the working of their conscious and unconscious minds. One can use it to build up his or her own mental well-being in todays stressful society. The aspects that cause mental illnesses are recognized as kleshes or mental destruction. The fundamental vision behind this method is found in Sabbasava Sutta, Satipattana Sutta, and Vattupama Sutta-[MajjimaNik.,] 
Buddhist psychotherapy cures mental sicknesses and enables understanding of the working of their conscious and unconscious minds

Janapada Kalyani and the charred monkey
Buddha visited his step-brother Prince Nanda the next day at his palace. The prince was planning to get married to the most gracious woman of the time, Janapada Kalyani, the loveliest girl in the kingdom, the next day. As he was taking his leave of them, Gautama Buddha presented his bowl to Nanda. Janapada Kalyani saw the prince walking away and requested his quick return. Kalyani was highly thrilled with the prospect of her marriage. Prince Nanda expected Gautama Buddha to take back the bowl near the entrance to monastery, but the Enlightened One did not do s. Gautama Buddha had later taken him to the monastery and made the prince give up the household life. 
At the monastery the prince was inspired by the arguments of the Buddha and accepted the path to renunciation. However his willpower was weak and feeble. His mind went back to the gorgeous bride to whom he had strong sensual longings, which gradually affected his health. However, Ven Nanda Thera spoke to colleagues and said, I am discontented with leading the sacred life, friends. I am unable to bear the holy life,. This message was communicated to Gautama Buddha. Ven Nanda Thera admitted the fact, saying, The warm and loving words and her beloveds tears enthused me deeply and continues to do so. Gautama Buddha, who with his heavenly eye, saw that Ven. Nanda, with a more strengthened mind, could grasp the Dhamma and enjoy the supreme satisfaction of insight. He thought of a little psycho-analytic therapy to retain him without disturbing his present frame of mind. The Enlightened One asked him to accompany him to the Himalayan range. Gautama Buddha took him by the hand, left Jeta Wanaya (A wood) and appeared among idols of Thawatimsa. Hundreds of pink-footed nymphs had come to minister to Sakkra, the chronicle says. 
A comparison
What do you think, Nanda Who is more beautiful or fairer to look at, and more appealing Gautama Buddha then made Ven. Nanda witness a scene of a charred body of a female monkey in a Chena. Is it Kalyanie or the gorgeous celestial nymphs Nanda had responded by saying that in comparison these nymphs his girl was like the charred body of the female monkey. Gautama Buddha, putting a bit of psychology into use, focused on the immature mind of Nanda. Gautama Buddha said that he could get him any of those nymphs as his bride, on the condition that he would not leave the monastery. Revered Sir if you give me a guarantee I shall be content with monastic life, came the quick reply.  Gautama Buddha was a physician and a surgeon of the psyche. He believed in treating the cause, not the symptoms [Nidhana], exactly what they practise in modern psychotherapy. According to Dhamma, all human chaos is basically mind related and stems from three harmful motivating factors namely, attraction Lobha, repulsion Dhosa and delusion Moha. The story of the prince had been unjustly distorted in many a script. Nanda in his excitement had come to an agreement. When he reached the monastery other monks questioned his initiation as a monk. They laughed at him and called him menial and hireling, and he felt humiliated, embarrassed. He eventually saw his motive as the basepsychotherapy worked. Renouncing desire he gathered up his nerve. He then realised the coarseness of all compounded things. Nanda became an Arhant. It was an occasion when Gautama Buddha used his skills inpsycho-therapy.

Sanath Gunathilake The undone hero
	
Heroism, thwarted, facile and eventually undone: this is what makes up Sanath Gunathilakes best performances. Starting out as a secondary player, graduating to lead roles, Gunathilake found himself epitomising a new kind of protagonist, the sort that was prone to introspection on the one hand and violent, spontaneous fits of suspicion on the other. His calm exterior, assured and cocky, was rarely sustained throughout. It always tended to go downhill, at the cost of those he despised and even those he loved. As Piyatilake in Kadapathaka Chaya, Willie (Walaha) in Palama Yata, Tissa in Sakman Maluwa (all of which won him Sarasavi Awards), thus, he tries to maintain a calm demeanour in front of the women he loves, but when external forces intrude, he doesnt just break up that calmness, he breaks up those women. 
Many of his performances  particularly his lead performances  contain this almost cowardly quality of helpless fury, at times underscored by a mild aggressive streak that is, nevertheless, never completely realised (when he tries to level with Vijaya Kumaratunga in Kadapathaka Chaya, hes put down, and whats more put down by Vijayas crutches), and they signal, for me, a new era in our cinema. Gunathilake is an antihero, even at his most heroic, and because of that he swerves from one opposite to another, trying to hold his world together and then breaking it open, confirms his suspicions when he realises that it cant be held together. He doesnt do this for nothing, by the way; more often than not hes cuckolded, and even when hes not, he thinks hes been cuckolded. (At the very end of Sakman Maluwa, Kanchana Mendis, desperately trying to allay his suspicions in this regard, touches his chest and pleads, The snake in our garden is in there. Only you can destroy it.) 
Limitations
He tries so hard to be more than who he is but because of his personal convictions, or rather the lack thereof, he fails and flounders badly. He tries to make up for this limitation by shouting, hollering, abusing the people hes sworn to love, and to a considerable extent that gets him what he wants, though at an exorbitant cost: the rebellion of his womans son in Palama Yata, the casual inhumanity he caves into in Kadapatha Chaya, the expedience he surrenders to at the exclusion of his lover in Sisila Gini Gani. Years later, as he mellowed, and as these anti-heroic characters grew on us, he matured and reached an apotheosis of sorts by turning into dislikeable colonels and, worse, politicians, as with King Hunther, Ran Diya Dahara, and, pitted against Ranjan Ramanayake, Sinhaya. Those features of his that mark him out at this period in his career  the stout figure, the perpetual frown, the overhanging chin  turn him into what hed been turning into all his life and career. 
If you are tempted to compare this anti-heroic streak to Ravindra Randeniya, you arent entirely in the wrong, but you arent entirely in the right either. Ravindra could always get away with his facile charm, except when he sought moral resurrection (Anantha Rathriya), in which case he didnt care about maintaining it. Gunathilake, on the other hand, doesnt resort to that charm, because he doesnt have it: right until his recent performances, he lacks the facile geniality which Randeniya and even Kumaratunga (as Kadapatha Chaya showed) had.
Gunathilake is an antihero, even at his most heroic, and because of that he swerves from one opposite to another, trying to hold his world together and then breaking it open, confirms his suspicions when he realises that it cant be held together
Even at his most innocent (and what better film do we have here to point at than Viragaya) he isnt exactly likeable. He is what his behaviour is and his behaviour is what he is. His looks dont help him; the conviction it brings about is ancillary to the conviction he unearths through his actions and motives, and they are most discernible when hes acting out his baser instincts; you notice them the moment you begin to despise him. 
Gunathilake was born in Kandy to a fairly middle class family. His father was a lawyer and his mother a teacher. Their tastes differed rather wildly (the father loved the movies, the mother despised them), and this found its way to the son. Schoolteachers think that films corrupt children, so mother didnt take to them like father did. He doted on Vijaya Kumaratunga and Gamini Fonseka. He was always taking me to the best shows in town, all of which were commercial and mainstream. As for art cinema, well, my mother had a soft spot for them despite her feelings towards movies. So my childhood oscillated between these two people; through my father I saw Soorayangeth Sooraya, while through my mother I saw Delovak Athara, said Gunathilake.
Excels at studiesActing hadnt figured in him at that point, however. There were other priorities. At my school, Kingswood College, though I loved to act in stage dramas and what-not, I had to do with only one or two extracurricular activities because I wanted to focus on my studies, said Gunathilake. This paid off rather well when he received top marks for his Ordinary Levels, a feat that, sadly, however, was not repeated at his Advanced Levels: What happened was that while I secured high results, I couldnt secure a placement at the university because I couldnt obtain the required mark for the district rank, similar to the Z-Score system today. Those who got lower results, from other areas, managed to get in. I, on the other hand, had to go searching for a job,reflected Gunathilake.
Hunting for jobs, then as now, wasnt exactly easy, and Gunathilake, called various agencies, only to be rebuffed later on, found some consolation in the movies. This was in the seventies, when we saw the rise of a middle cinema through the likes of H. D. Premaratne. The distinction between art and entertainment blurred and filmmakers like Premaratne tried to incorporate elements from both. Could I have known that I would be taking part in his movies a little more than a decade later Of course not! For the time being, the films I saw convinced me that the cinema was more, much more, than an overly simple and simplistic tussle between what was arty and what was mainstream. A middle path could be sought, and sustained well too, he said.
It was at this point that Gunathilake came across an advertisement in a newspaper calling out for prospective actors who were more than five feet and six inches tall. He fitted the bill neatly. Entertaining no illusions, he sent his details, particularly after he read that the candidates educational qualifications would not be considered. It was for a film by Vijaya Dharma Sri, another director who was trying to pave a middle path in our cinema, and for an upcoming movie called Situ Kumariyo, he reminisced. Needless to say, he was selected.
Gunathilake needed it and eventually got it. Sumitra Peries helped him in that regard by casting him as Ranjith in Ganga Addara and Pujitharatne in Yahalu Yeheli. While these were short, terse performances, they convinced other directors to take him in: D. B. Nihalsinghe (Ridi Nimnaya and Maldeniye Simion), Sunil Ariyaratne (Kele Mal), Lester James Peries (Kaliyugaya, as the errant Alan), and H. D. Premaratne (Deveni Gamana and Mangala Thagga). 
He tries so hard to be more than who he is but because of his personal convictions, or rather the lack thereof, he fails and flounders badly.
Balancing act
Glancing through his credits it strikes me that while he had to perform a balancing act between the popular and the serious during these years, and while he had to play second fiddle in many of his populist roles (most notably to Vijaya Kumaratunga), it was that balancing act that taught him that acting doesnt always entail being selective about what roles you land and what roles you dont.
In these early performances, Gunathilake tends to cower before authority. In Deveni Gamana, for instance, while he loves his wife, he has to put up with and listen to the haranguing of his mother and aunt (Irangani Serasinghe and Denawaka Hamine in one of their most vitriolic performances), while in Mangala Thagga he has to put up with the schemes of his two friends (Ravindra Randeniya and Sriyantha Mendis). A decade or so later, he has learnt to reject authority while covertly accepting it; in Vasantha Obeyesekeres Dorakada Marawa he declares his intention to marry his lover (Sangeetha Weeraratne), but cannot quite get out of his obligations to his family, particularly his sisters; in Sakman Maluwa he accuses his wife of trying to poison him despite his overwhelmingdesire for her. 
And in his own directorial ventures, he plays out a variation of this character; the deformed clerk in Eka Math Eka Rataka and the misunderstood man of power in Sinahawa Atharin; in Isuru Weerasinghes Pani Makuluwo, he has gone even further, compounding all his characters to give out a veritable synthesis: a fearful, well meaning, flawed politician who loves his errant wife and yet is suspicious of her motives. You see in Pani Makuluwo the bringing together of an entire career, despite my reservations regarding the film as a whole and in Gunathilakes performance you infer a culmination; you sense, in other words, that this is what his career has been building up to, inexorably.

Senior UNPers signing No-Faith Motion against PM: JO
	
The Joint Opposition today said several stalwarts of United National Party (UNP) had started signing for the No-Confidence Motion, which was to be brought against Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.
Joint Opposition member MP Mahindananda Aluthgamage told a news conference that they would support for the No-Confidence Motion against Prime Minister Wickremesinghe and it would be presented in Parliament in the coming days.
Earlier we have planned to bring a No-Confidence Motion against Prime Minister Wickremesinghe however it was delayed.
We will sign for the No-Confidence Motion and would remove Prime Minister Wickremesinghe from his post, he said.
He said the most significant fact was that powerful members attached to the UNP would support the No-Confidence Motion and added that they were currently signing it.(Kalathma Jayawardhane)

SF will be Law and Order Minister in fortnight
	
Cabinet Spokesman Rajitha Senaratne confirmed yesterday that Regional Development Minister, Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka would be appointed the Minister of Law and Order in less than two weeks.
Minister Senaratne said that he was not sworn in as part of Sundays mini Cabinet reshuffle involving UNP ministers as he was on an overseas assignment at that time and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe took over the Law and Order Ministry portfolio temporarily until his return.
Addressing the weekly cabinet news briefing, Minister Senaratne said that unless something out of the ordinary occurred in the meantime this appointment would go ahead as planned.
The dialogue the ensued between Minister Senaratne and co-Cabinet spokesman Minister Gayantha Karunatilaka is as follows-:
Journalist: Prime Minister Wickremesinghe took over the Law and Order Ministry only for two weeks and therefore the Law and Order Ministry and the Police Department are in a limbo with no activity at the moment.
Minister Senaratne: You are wrong. The Police Department is in full gear looking after the security of the people and active on crime busting.
Journalist: Why wasn't Minister Fonseka present during Sundays Cabinet reshuffle
Minister Senaratne: How can he be here He was abroad.
Journalist: Prime Minister Wickremesinghe is a suspect in the Central Bank bond scam. Can we believe that he would direct the Police to act against former Central Bank governor Arjuna Mahendran
Minister Senaratne: You are totally wrong. Who told you the Prime Minister is a suspect in the CB bond scam case The Presidential Commission that probed the bond scam has not named the PM as a suspect in the case. Besides, Mr, Wickremesinghe appeared before the commission on his own will and assisted the commission in its inquiry.
Journalist: When do you expect Arjuna Mahendran to be brought back to Sri Lanka to face trial The last report said that he could not be found at his Singapore address
Minister Senaratne: Dont worry about that. The government will ensure that he would be rounded up and brought back from where ever he is with the cooperation and support of Interpol in the same manner Sri Lanka issued an international red warrant on former Sri Lanka ambassador in Russia, Udayanga Weeratunga. But to do this the Sri Lanka police and Interpol need a court order to be issued on Mahendran so that an international red warrant on him could be issued. It takes time.
Journalist: There are those who are opposing the appointment of Minister Fonseka as the Law and Order Minister.
Minister Senaratne: Some will support this and others won't. This is natural during any Cabinet reshuffle. A head of state cannot satisfy everyone during a Cabinet reshuffle. When former President Rajapaksa ordered a Cabinet reshuffle in 2007 many ministers were not happy. Ministers Maithripala Sirisena, John Seneviratne, Nimal Siripala De Silva and other did not like their new Cabinet posts. Minister Sirisena who was given the portfolio of health minister was in tears. I got the fisheries ministry which I did not like. All other ministers, while expressing their displeasure over what they were given said I had been given the best ministry. However I did not think so.
Journalist: But how long does the country have to put up with the constant bickering taking place between the UNP and the SLFP
Minister Senaratne: In a coalition government these things are common. The same happened during the WWII in Great Britain under the Conservative-Labour coalition government led by Attlee and Churchill. In the Yahapalana Government we agree to disagree. We engage in oral battles in and out of the Cabinet. But we run the government in unity.
Journalist: Many say the Cabinet reshuffle is not pragmatic and scientific as promised by leaders of the government. What's the rationale of amalgamating two extremely different subjects like Higher Education and Road Construction under one Minister No changes have been made to this Ministry after it was handed over to Minister Kabir Hashim after taking it away from Minister Lakshman Kiriella. Why
Minister Senaratne: I agree. The separation of ministries is very awkward and imprudent. I tried hard to convince the absurdity of this to our leaders without any success.
Journalist: Have you ever seen or heard about a national government like this
Minister Senaratne: Not at all. No where.
Journalist: The selecting of members to local government bodies is in a mess. Political parties have not been able to finalise their lists even though it is three weeks since the elections were held.
Minister Senaratne: Yes, the problem is nominating 25% female members from the other members in the list. The new electoral system needs further amendments to rectify these problems. (Sandun A Jayasekera)

SLPP threatens legal action against Thalatha
	
Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) Chairman G.L. Peiris said yesterday they would take legal action against former Foreign Employment Minister Thalatha Atukorale for allegedly transferring 30 employees who celebrated the victory of the SLPP at the local government elections.
Addressing a news briefing, he said the employees who celebrated the SLPP victory by displaying a banner and eating milk rice had been transferred to rural areas such as Jaffna, Vavuniya, Mullaitivu and Batticaloa.
Former Foreign Employment Minister Thalatha Atukorale had transferred these employees on February 23. This is unacceptable. We will file a fundamental rights petition in the Supreme Court on behalf of the employees and also file lawsuit against the minister demanding compensation, he said.
On a different note, he said the Cabinet reshuffle was a drama that had no impact on the people whatsoever.
The only outcome of the reshuffle was the UNP being bolstered. It still holds economic nerve centres under its command. However, one should bear in mind that handing over the Law and Order Ministry to Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe acts in favour of former Central Bank Governor Arjuna Mahendran. If Mahendran were arrested, the UNP will be put in a difficult position based on the information he reveals. Therefore, the UNP is not keen in putting Mahendran behind bars, he said.

Thambuttegama: Thugs used to disperse protestors, says NFF
	
Thugs had been used to disperse the group of farmers, who protested at Thambuttegama yesterday against Governments move to use water of the Rajanganaya Tank for a water supply project, National Freedom Front (NFF) Spokesman Mohammed Muzammil said today.
Addressing a news conference, he said the NFF condemned the attack on the protestors and added the Government should take action over using thugs along with Police personnel to disperse the protestors.
It is natural that people become agitated against such moves by a Government. It is unfair to use water from the Rajanganaya Tank for a Water Supply project because a lot of farmers depend on the tank, Muzammil said.
It was clearly evident that protestors were beaten by individuals who were not Police personnel. It is absolutely undemocratic to disperse protestors in such manner. The Government should probe the incident closely, Muzammil added.
Meanwhile, he said the Government announcement that the project had been suspended was not credible.
He added the Government should announce clearly what its intentions were in such circumstances without temporarily suspending a project. (Sheain Fernandopulle)

The inner reality  in a film
	
In the new wave in Sinhala cinema there emerged three social conscious new filmmakers who have also earned international recognition. They are Prasanna Vithanage, Asoka Handagama and Vimukthi Jayasundara. 
All three have come together produced a three part film (this is a new venture in Lanka) titled Thundenak in Sinhala, Moovar in Thamil and Her, Him, The Other in English. This is a novel kind of film in that the creative interpretation of three minds have assembled here to depict in implicit and subtle dimensions an-anti war film. Their art of film making is commendable by international standards. Congratulations to all three of them! 
The producers have succinctly introduces what the film is about and that makes my task easy. The war between Tamil militants and Government forces of Sri Lanka lasted for three decades. 
Thousands from both parties, combatants and civilians died due to the battle. The Government forces crushed the Tamil militants in May 2009. Its time to assess each others conscience. He (annex-militant videographer for the LTTE) travels from the North in search of HER (a young widow of a government army soldier) in the South to find relief from the pain that disturbed his conscience.  This part of the film is engrossing as it is directed by indomitable Prasanna Vithanage. His cinematic art should be analyzed at a different time. Vimukthi Jayasundara films the second part with diabolical questions in the He characterization. We shall continue with the story as described by the producers. 
Having been raised in a religion that has faith in reincarnation, he (a Singhala language teacher) tries to deceive his own conscience by refusing to believe the rebirth of a Tamil militant into a Sinhala family witnessed by Him with his own eyes. 
There are a lot of ironies in this film which are very clear to a seasoned cinemagoer and Jyasundara brings outer reality and the innate reality of closed minds beautifully in the natural setting of the arid border villages between the Northern and North Central Provinces. His virtuosity should be analyzed later. 
We now come to the city of Colombo with the director of this part in the film Asoka Handagama, who is also acting brilliantly in the film. We shall look at his double playing later. 
Meanwhile the storyline is described as follows and it ends there. 
Ones hero is the Others traitor. But a mother will lose a son in a war. How many wars... 
In this movie that reminds us that how foolish some of us are not realizing that war is futile. 
When we were born we didnt have any land. Birth is an accident when one is born in a particular community and in the next birth he might be born in a different community. The blood in our veins is all red in colour and there is no such thing as Sinhala blood or Tamil blood or Muslim blood. Cedits must be given to the cinematographers in the calibre of M D Mahindapala and the others. They are masters of the art. 
The part played by Kesavarajan and others are very convincing with actualities of experience. 
Thinking people from various communities must shed away their petty prejudices and think about the others as fellow human beings and empathize with them. Thats the lesson I learned seeing this film.

US says its laws prohibit firms from bribing foreign govts
	
The laws and regulations drafted by the US had ensured that no US firm or its citizen could pay bribes when selling goods and services to foreign government, the US Embassy in Sri Lanka yesterday said.
Issuing a statement over the visit of Stephen Renna, Director of the Advocacy Center at the US Department of Commerce, the Embassy said when selling goods and services to foreign governments, the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act makes it unlawful for US firms and American citizens to pay bribes or otherwise violate the law.
The values, practices and international standards that American companies bring to the table make them the finest partners for improving standards and quality throughout business ecosystems.Trade and investment are the engines of growth and employment and the US is Sri Lankas largest trading partner, purchasing around Rs. 445 billion in Sri Lankan goods in 2017andsustaining tens of thousands of jobs in Sri Lanka, it said.
Mr.Rennamet with government leaders and US companies in Colombo to discuss opportunities to increase US exports to Sri Lankaduring the visit.The USis eager to expand open, fair and reciprocal trade, he said.
Meanwhile, US Ambassador Atul Keshap said US companies produce the highest quality goods and services with the highest standards for ethics, corporate social responsibility, employee benefits, and environmental awareness. 
The statement said the USexported USD 337 million of goods to Sri Lankalast year.
There is tremendous opportunity for that figure to grow. American firms provide Sri Lanka with top quality, fair and reliable solutions Sri Lanka needs to expand transportation infrastructure, improve agricultural output, attract more tourists and provide and improve services for its citizens, it said.

Ven.Amarawansha Thera The  erudite monk  from Matale no more
	
Bodhimalaka Pushparamaya in Tabbowa, Naththandiya is reminiscent of the Late Most Ven. Matale Amarawansha Thera. My familys association with the monk spanned well over there decades. Whenever we visited our relatives in Mahawewa, we made it a point to visit the Rajamahaviharaya and its serene surroundings and to call upon Ven. Amarawansha Thera. Reiterating the impermanence of life, his physical form is no more.
The late Thera departed from this earth exactly three months ago, at the age of 80 years, having fulfilled his duties and responsibilities as the Chief Incumbent of Bodhimalaka Pushparamaya. 
During his lifetime the monk had contributed immensely to the religious, economic, social and cultural upliftment of the people of Tabbowa, whilst not forgetting his hometown, Matale
In late December last year, having learned that Ven. Amarawansha Thera was undergoing treatment at Sri Jayawardenepura Hospital, I visited him and had the good fortune of spending close to an hour in conversation with him. He spoke of the difficult path he trod, having been born in a very remote village named Polwattakanda in the Matale District. He was surprised, yet pleased to see me and recollected with a sharp memory, the first time my family was introduced to him by Ven. Tissamaharamaye Jinaratana Thera, of Kapilavastupura Mahinda Viharaya. Ven. Jinaratana Thera succeeded Ven. Amarawansha Thera. He inquired after my mother and invited both of us to visit him in Tabbowa, once he recovers and returns to the temple. This was not to be. A few days later, I learned of the passing away of yet another learned and a courageous Buddhist Priest. 
Ven. Amarawansha Thera was born on 17th March, 1937 to Tikirirala Nilame and Budugahagedara Ranmenike. He was ordained as a novice monk on 2nd November, 1951 under the erudite Late Rev. Tabbowa Wajirawansha Thera. He undertook Preliminary studies at Balagalle, Saraswati Pirivena and continued higher studies at Sri Lanka Vidyalaya, Maradana and received Upasampada (Higher ordination) on 16th of March, 1958 at Kalyananadi Seemamalakaya.
He successfully completed the Tripitaka exams of Sri Ramanna Nikaya (Sri Lanka) as well as those of Burma (Myanmar). He was blessed to have associated with many learned Members of the Buddhist Clergy, the Chief Priests of the Ramanna Niyaka namely Most Ven. Henpitagedara Gnanaseeha Thera, Ven. Hissalle Dhammaratana Thera, Ven. Hapuwalane Gnanaseeha Thera, Ven. Naththadiye Pannnasara Thera and Ven. Anuradhapuraye Somasiri Thera, to name a few. 
The late Thera departed from this earth exactly three months ago, at the age of 80 years, having fulfilled his duties and responsibilities as the Chief Incumbent of Bodhimalaka Pushparamaya
Ven. Amarawansha had a commanding and a charismatic personality, and was well versed in the Sinhala language. His achievements are far too numerous to describe. During his lifetime the monk had contributed immensely to the religious, economic, social and cultural upliftment of the people of Tabbowa, whilst not forgetting his hometown, Matale. 
Ven. Amarawansha Thera participated at World Buddhist Conferences in Japan, India and Singapore. A sapling of the Sacred Bo Tree was gifted to Thailand, symbolic of the two Buddhist nations. This was another meritorious gesture on his part. Ven. Amarawansha Thera, over the years, had served as an advisor on religious affairs to several Heads of State of Sri Lanka, some of whom paid their last respects, which was ample testimony to the yeoman service rendered in his capacity as an adviser. 
I believe that the close association Ven. Amarawansha Thera shared with my late Father W.P.R.B.Wickremasinghe was based on their intellectual compatibility and their mutual patriotic feelings. Most Ven. Amarawansha Theras oratory skills were observed by me at my Late fathers funeral in 1998 during which he made a forceful and fiery speech. 
Always sporting a smile and being a strict disciplinarian, he was an epitome of a disciple of the Enlightened One. It was our good fortune to have been able to associate with Ven. Amarawansha Thera. We will remember him with much reverence. 
Always sporting a smile and being a strict disciplinarian, he was an epitome of a disciple of the Enlightened One
Full of joy, full of faith in the Teachings of the Buddha, the Monk attains the Peaceful State, the bliss of cessation of conditional things. (The Dhammapada) (Champa D. R. Wickremasinghe)
