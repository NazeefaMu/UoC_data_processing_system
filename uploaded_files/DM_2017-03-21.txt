Arresting MPs; problem to carry out duties in the House: Dinesh
	
Joint opposition parliamentary group leader Dinesh Gunawardane today informed Speaker Karu Jayasuriya that not giving bail to MPs who have been remanded has become a problem for those MPs to carry out their duties in the House.
Mr Gunawardhane actually requested the speaker to look into this matter.
He raised this matter in the House just less than 24 hours after courts decided to re-remand MP Wimal Weerawansha till April 13 this year. However Mr Gunawardhane did not name any MP when he made the request from the speaker.
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya who responded said he has already begun to discuss the issue with the relevant persons and assured that he will take necessary action this week. (Yohan Perera and Ajith Siriwardana)

Biding time for a better political climate
	

A deputy purohita known to be a close confidant of a onetime powerful political leader has skipped the country, they say.

According to informed sources, the deputy had quietly left the country on information received that he was due to be quizzed by Police sleuths in connection with some complaints made against him to the FCID and the CID.
February 22 this year was the last day he had attended the Diyawanna council and he had not been seen in public ever since.
According to the leave entitlement of Diyawanna members, the deputy could keep away from the sittings of the council up to August this year. And he had dodged questioning by Police with the expectation that the changes in the political climate would lead to dropping of investigations against him by that time, they say.

China aims advanced DF-16 missiles at Taiwan: minister
	

TAIPEI AFP March20, 2017 - China is aiming advanced medium-range ballistic missiles at Taiwan as part of a growing military threat towards the island, Taipeis defence minister said Monday.  The announcement came after Taiwan said for the first time last week that it is capable of launching missiles at China as it warned of an increased invasion risk. 
China still sees Taiwan as part of its territory to be brought back into its fold, by force if necessary, even though the island has been self-governing since the two sides split after a civil war in 1949.

Crime on the high seas
	
Piracy, the act of robbery or criminal violence by ship or boat-borne attackers upon another ship or a coastal area, is a common occurrence in international waters.
Piracy is of note in international law as it is commonly held to represent the earliest invocation of the concept of universal jurisdiction. The crime of piracy is considered a breach of jus cogens, a conventional peremptory international norm that needs to be upheld by states. 
In an unexpected turn of events, a Comoros-flagged tanker MT Aris 13 was hijacked by Somali pirates while on course to Mogadishu from Djibouti. Sri Lanka made headlines once again as the crew on board consisted eight locals who were held captive for three long days.
The Daily Mirror spoke to International Transport Workers Federation (ITF) local representative Ranjan Perera to inquire about the incident and to find out how local entities could involve themselves during such events.

Foreign Ministry has a pivotal role to play
- Ranjan Perera 
Secretary General of National Union of Seafarers Sri Lanka (NUSS) and International Transport Workers Federation (ITF) local representative Ranjan Perera said the local agent was contacted when such an incident occurred.
Later, the Shipping Ministry conveys the news to the family members of the victims. The Foreign Ministry has a bigger role to play in it. They handle it on behalf of the government. The ITF represents the interests of transport workers unions in bodies which take decisions affecting employment or safety in the transport industry including the International Labour Organisation (ILO), the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) and the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO).
Speaking further, Ranjan said a major function of the ITF was informing and advising unions about developments in the transport industry in other countries or regions of the world.
The ITF organises international solidarity when transport unions in one country are in conflict with employers or governments and need direct help from the unions in other countries.
SOMALI PIRACY MODEL
Piracy off the coast of Somalia has been a threat to international shipping since the second phase of the Somali civil war in the early 21st century. According to OBP, piracy impeded the delivery of shipments and increased shipping expenses costing an estimated $6.6 to $6.9 billion a year in global trade in 2011. Somali piracy is unique among worldwide piracy business models due to the level of community support Somali pirates have enjoyed in the past and the ability to hold crews and vessels for months, or even years in safe havens just off the coast during ransom negotiations.
After the fall of the Siad Barre regime in 1991, Somali piracy has raised its head, targeting vessels off the coast of Puntland and the Gulf of Aden in violent robberies. The hijack for ransom model developed significantly in the early 2000s, and became the primary model by 2005 when the number of these incidents shot from 2 to 14 in a single year.
Piracy has diminished since 2012 largely due to mitigating efforts at sea by international naval forces. However, the situation in Somalia that originally permitted piracy to flourish has not changed. This has paved the way for other forms of maritime crime including smuggling and trafficking.
According to OBP, this unfortunate incident marks the first hijacking since 2012, but it doesnt indicate a large-scale return of Somali piracy. However, Somali pirates have still been active in recent months. The OBP analytics indicate the following:

	The number of reported failed attacks and suspicious incidents rose in 2016.
	
	
	Armed security teams deterred 11 attacks in 2016.
	
	
	The Muhammadi, attacked on November 22, 2015 roughly 250 nm off Eyl, was the last known hijacking incident in the region.
	
	
	On October 22, the CPO Korea, UK-flagged chemical tanker was approached by a skiff of armed men who exchanged fire with the security team.
	
	
	Somali pirates are still holding eight seafarers from the fishing vessel- the Siraj, who were captured on March 26, 2015.
	

THE INCIDENT
The tanker MT Aris 13 had left Djibouti on March 8, 2017 and was reaching Mogadishu when the crew reported two armed skiffs approaching the vessel. The information received by the Maritime Rescue Coordination Centre (MRCC) in France was communicated to MRCC in Colombo, but by that time, the vessel had dropped communication with the French body. The pirates who have arrived in two boats have seized the ship approximately 18km off the Northern tip of Somalia to the coastal town of Caluula in Somalias Puntland State.
It was then confirmed that eight Sri Lankans were on board, namely, S.A. Nicholas (Captain) from Mattakkuliya, Ruwan Sampath (Chief Officer) from Matugama, J. Kalubowila (Chief Engineer) from Horana, Dileepa Ranaweera (Third Officer) from Galle, Janaka Samendra (Third Engineer) from Matara, Sunil Perera (Bosun) from Kandana, Lahiru Indunil Widanapathirana (Able Seaman) from Galle and A. Shanmugham (Cook) from Negombo.

According to Oceans Beyond Piracy, a programme of the One Earth Foundation, a privately-funded and independent non-profit organisation located in Colorado, USA, it was revealed that the MT Aris 13 was preparing to cut through the Socotra Gap between the tip of Somalia and the island of Socotra. This route is frequently used as a cost and time saving measure by vessels travelling down the East coast of Africa despite the threat of piracy. Additionally, Aris 13 has had a low freeboard of only three metres, and has been moving at a slow pace of five knots. These factors made the vessel an easier target for pirates who typically board ships with ladders from fast moving skiffs.
According to a UN shipping database, it was reported that MT Aris 13 was owned by the Panama company Armi Shipping SA whose address was listed in care of Aurora Shipping Management FZE, a company based in Fujairah in the United Arab Emirates.

The pirates demanded a ransom and held the vessel in captivity and released the vessel on March 16 when they found that the vessel was hired by Somali businessmen. According to the pirates, their primary intention of hijacking the ship had not been collecting ransom, but protesting against illegal fishing practices carried out by international vessels, which have threatened the livelihoods of the local fisherfolk. The release followed a gunfight earlier in the day between the pirates and the marine force.

Earlier, the NPC said there were 11,000 women employed in the force but they could only legally appoint two to the positions of SP.( Darshana Sanjeewa)

expected to rubbish Trumps wiretapping claims
	
FBI Director James Comey is expected to officially undercut President Donald Trumps claims that he was wiretapped by the Obama administration during testimony before Congress on Monday, according to ABC News. 
Citing people who are familiar with Comeys thinking, the FBI director will likely make US law enforcements most public rebuke to date of Trumps allegations. 
Comey is set to testify at a rare public hearing on Monday about alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election. US lawmakers from both parties said on Sunday they had seen no proof to support the claim by Trump, adding pressure on the president to explain or back off his repeated assertion. Several Republicans last week urged Trump to apologize for the allegations he made in a series of tweets on March 4. The maelstrom also caused tension with key US allies and threatens to distract Republicans from campaign promises on health care and taxes.The Justice Department on Friday delivered documents to congressional committees to help clear up whether the Obama administration spied on Trump. 
Trumps claims widened to two of the USs staunchest allies. He repeated an unsubstantiated claim that Britains cyber intelligence organization conducted the surveillance at Obamas behest, a claim the agency GBHQ flatly denied; and mentioned during German Chancellor Angela Merkels first visit to the Trump White House the Obama administrations monitoring of Merkels cellphone, a bruising incident in German-US relations.

The head of a very important institution linked to liquor is to go on retirement shortly and a certain white collar one holding a subordinate rank in this institution is said to be making a desperate bid to grab the high office about to fall vacant through political influence, they say.

This high post by tradition is reserved for a senior mandarin from the administrative service. However, the ambitious one having an eye on it is reportedly offering gifts in cash and kind to the wife of the purohita directly responsible for appointing a successor to the institutional head about to retire.
While trying to win the favor of purohitas wife by offering her gifts, the ambitious one is also getting various parties to make written requests to the purohita concerned to appoint him to the high post when it falls vacant.

If the distillery owned by Arjun Aloysius is given a huge tax concession it would have serious repercussions on palm arrack manufactured in the Northern Province, the Sri Lanka Freedom Party Youth Front (SLFPYF) said today.
SLFP Youth Front President Shantha Bandara said the Excise Department and the Finance Ministry had permitted the construction of the distillery.
He said the Government had already increased excise duty on locally manufactured palm arrack and coconut toddy while the Finance Ministry had also given tax concessions to local distilleries.
Mr. Bandara said on the one side government spoke of an alcohol-free country while on the other side it authorised local distilleries.
The company owned by Mr. Aloysius is bound to affect the livelihood of Tamils involved in the manufacture of palm arrack and cripple the economy of the Northern Province, he said.
According to the 2017 Budget proposals liquor manufacturing companies such as those owned by Mr. Aloysius will receive a 100 per cent tax concession for locating its distillery at Kalkudha. (Yoshitha Perera)

New Zealand expels US diplomat after police probe stymied
	
WELLINGTON AFP March20, 2017- A US diplomat has been expelled from New Zealand after Washington refused to waive diplomatic immunity so police investigating a serious crime could question him, officials said Monday. 
Details of the alleged crime have not been revealed but local media reported the diplomat left the South Pacific nation last week suffering a broken nose and black eye. 
Prime Minister Bill English labelled the US knock-back on immunity regrettable and said he expected American authorities to carry out their own investigation.  We expect all diplomats here to obey our law and if its broken wed expect our police to investigate, English told reporters. 
We regret that they didnt give us a waiver on immunity but they didnt and now its in the hands of their authorities.

No foreign judges, only foreign observers: PM
	
The Government is agreeable to the presence of foreign observers and not to foreign judges to view the judicial procedures on human rights violations, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe told Parliament today.
He was responding to a question asked by joint opposition parliamentary group leader Dinesh Gunawardane as to how the Foreign Affairs Minister was to be a signatory of a co-sponsored resolution at the UN Human Rights Council Sessions amid the President and the Prime Minister clearly stating that Sri Lanka was not agreeable to include foreign judges in any judicial proceedings on human rights violations.
Mr. Gunawardene said this government had co-sponsored a resolution which was harmful to the country and inquired whether it was going to do the same this year as well.
The Prime Minister in his response said Sri Lanka would not permit foreign judges to participate in any judicial proceedings and would not agree to the setting up of hybrid courts.
However, he said foreign observers might be invited only to view the proceedings and recalled that it was the previous regime which agreed to set up an internationally-accepted mechanism to into allegations of human rights violations.
"The fact of the matter is that the previous government clearly undertook to work with the UN in conducting court proceedings on allegations of human rights violations under the agreements reached with the then UN Secretary General Ban Ki Moon soon after the war ended in 2009," the Prime Minister said.
He said this government would only set up a truth commission but would in not way agree to any criminal proceedings. (Yohan Perera and Ajith Siriwardana)

Foreign Minister Mangala Samaraweera has accepted the report on the OHCHR investigation on Sri Lanka and had co-sponsored the resolution on Sri Lanka without the consent of the President and the Cabinet, the joint opposition told the UN Human Right Council (UNHRC).
JO member Sarath Weerasekara who spoke to Daily Mirror from Geneva said he told the UNHCR that Sri Lanka was involved in a non international armed conflict between the government and the LTTE and as such the armed forces could not be accused of violating the International Human Rights Law (IHL).
In an armed conflict, only International Humanitarian Laws are applicable and therefore it cannot be charged under the International Human Rights Law. When you apply IHL it is very clear that it was the LTTE and not the Sri Lankan security forces who committed war crimes, he said.
Mr. Weerasekara is said to have tabled two reports -- one carrying the views of world renown experts claiming that security forces had not committed war crimes and the other prepared by a panel of experts to show that the OHCHR report was seriously flawed with contradictions, omissions and lies.
Its a pity that the UNHRC which looked away when the LTTE was using people as human shields and recruiting child soldiers is now levelling war crime charges on the very troops who destroyed the LTTE and protected Human Rights. It an example of double standards and hypocrisy, he said.
On behalf of the JO, Mr. Weerasekara requested the UN General Assembly to assign a special rapporteur to investigate the matter and impose a moratorium on the UNHRC from pursuing the resolution any further till investigations were completed. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

Presidents Russia visit: Economic and Defence Cooperation  high on agenda   SL Ambassador
	
Ahead of President Maithripala Sirisenas State visit to Russia; the first in decades by a Sri Lankan leader, the countrys Ambassador to Moscow Dr. Saman Weerasinghe outlines the significance of relationship between the two sides. The two countries marked the 60th anniversary of diplomatic ties this year. Dr. Weerasinghe shared the following with the : Daily Mirror.
	Exported 34mn kg of tea to russia in 2016
	
	
	Russia always stood by Sri Lanka
	
	
	Sri Lanka can harness Russias potential
	
	
	New efforts underway for tea promotion
	
	
	Nuclear energy has pros and cons
	

How do you assess the importance of SL-Russia relations 
The Sri Lanka-Russia relationship has always been cordial. SL was among the first countries that established diplomatic relations with former Soviet Union. Today, we are commemorating two important milestones. As you know the first one is the 60th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between SL and Russia which was marked on February 19, 2017. The second milestone which could be considered to be even more significant in the history of bilateral relations between our two countries, is the first official visit of the Sri Lankan Head of State to Russia after several decades. 
Furthermore, Russia has always supported SL in almost every international resolution brought forward. Russia has been with SL in times of crisis. So our bilateral relations are referred to as friendship. 
President Sirisena is planning to visit Russia this month. How useful will the visit be 
As I told Sri Lanka is always continuing its fruitful relations with Russia. Both Sides welcomed initiatives to promote direct links between the two nations and gave positive evaluation of the work of the SL-Russia Intergovernmental Joint Commission on Economic, Trade and Scientific Cooperation. Our Presidents visit will make a thorough review of the progress of joint projects in different fields of bilateral cooperation. 
The prospect of joint agreements, increased investments, greater participation in tourism and travel, expansion of trade and economic relations and defence ties within the framework of the Sri Lankan governments plan, will be high on the agenda of the Presidents visit to Russia. 
During this visit, SL and Russia are preparing to sign several agreements, including in the spheres of Fisheries, Tourism and Defence Cooperation. 


"The prospect of joint agreements, increased investments, greater participation in tourism and travel, expansion of trade and economic relations and defence ties within the framework of the Sri Lankan governments plan, will be high on the agenda of the Presidents visit to Russia"

How has the relationship with Russia evolved under the new government 
The new govt of Sri Lanka from the very first day started implementing the policy of friendly and mutually effective cooperation in regard to other countries. Considering that Russia is one of the major allies of Sri Lanka on the global arena, the new Govt focused on strengthening of existing relationships and exploring new fields to establish direct cooperation. 
Last year, President Maithripala Sirisena met with the President of the Russian Federation Vladimir Putin for the first time at the BRICS Summit 2016 held in Goa, India, and after their first meeting the Presidential Secretariat received an official invitation for President Sirisena to visit Russia in 2017. This visit is the milestone of bilateral relationships between SL and Russia, and I am certain that immediately after this memorable occasion both countries would urge each other, now more than ever, to diversify bilateral ties and strengthen the already-existing cooperation. 
The first SL-Russia Intergovernmental Joint Commission on Economic, Trade and Scientific Cooperation was held in February last year at the Russian Federation. We see this as a new step in policy level collaborations of two countries in the sphere of Customs Duties, Science and Technology Cooperation, Fisheries Sector Cooperation and a road to future potential avenues. 
As for the potential areas of cooperation, Russia is technologically advanced in the areas of infrastructure development; power energy, gas and oil explorations and many more. Sri Lanka can definitely see the possibility of using these advanced technologies for its developments. 
However, during the period where I served as the Ambassador, I was able to expand our trade relationships beyond the traditional tea market to a diversified basket of consumer products. SL showcased its most other food and beverages at various international exhibitions in Moscow and tapped the Russian market for sea food, spices, coconut-by products, confectionery, processed fruits, vegetables, etc. 
Ninteen Sri Lankan sea food processing companies have been identified and registered by the Russian Federation enabling them to export to Russia and see it as a win-win situation where the Russian customers too gained the opportunity of consuming the unique taste of seafood from Sri Lanka. 
We have organized a Gem and Jewellery networking session for Sri Lankan exporters and Russian Buyers in the Embassy, and we have had more than 80 interested parties attending this event, and it showed us that the vacuum existed for these unique local produce. We are happy that we had the opportunity to make correct match that serves both countries. 
During the previous regime, Russias Gazprom sought to invest in oil and gas exploration in Sri Lanka. What is its current status 
As you know Gazprom holds the worlds largest natural gas reserves. The companys share in the global and Russian reserves amounts to 17 and 72% respectively. Gazprom keeps expanding its capacity in a way that mutually benefited to every party. So its no doubt about their technical capacity and project implementation procedure. 
Also they have already in the projects with Europe for more than 40 years, and have positive collaborations with China for gas pipeline projects and other energy related projects. Not only China, they have recently, on the sidelines of the 8th BRICS Summit in India; India and Gazprom signed a memorandum that shows the interest of the parties in jointly exploring the routes for pipeline gas supplies from Russia and other countries to India, as well as the opportunities for cooperation in other areas. 
Looking at these, I cannot say that its very far that for us to also explore theses energy sources; so in this scenario, the discussions meetings and the documented processes would definitely be the base for Sri Lanka. 


"My view is that having a power plant in Tamil Nadu will have almost the same effect, if it is in Sri Lanka, in case of a disaster. Hence it is time for our experts to study the pros and cons, the country requirement and the social impacts in order for us also to find an energy solution for the country"

Recently the Russian Ambassador here said Russia had the capacity to invest in a nuclear energy sector in Sri Lanka. Any move in that direction 
When you come to talk about nuclear power it has a story of two sides. The economic impact and the social controversy are these two sides. Both are equally important. 
If you see almost all the developed countries of the world, power and energy is one of the cheapest utility products and almost all of it generate through nuclear power. Economic development of a country depends on cost of production. And one of the highest cost factors is energy especially for a country like Sri Lanka. Hence it is more important for us to see a cheap source of energy. 
The controversy all comes as it has some very serious threats. Best example was the disaster that inflicted major damage of the Fukushima nuclear power plant in Japan in 2011 following Tsunami. We were reminded of just how dangerous nuclear power could be. Japan failed in quick corrective actions for this disaster. Also it is riskier in terms of human error, terrorist attacks and natural disasters. This has very bad environmental results. Therefore, what I am trying to explain is this is an area for the experts of all these sectors to get together and decide. 
However, I should mention here that we all know that the Russian Federation is in the process of establishing Koondankulam Nuclear Power plant project in Koondankulam of Tamil Nadu State. It is the single largest nuclear power plant project in India and now at the third stage of development. 
My view is that having a power plant in Tamil Nadu will have almost the same effect, if it is in Sri Lanka, in case of a disaster. Hence it is time for our experts to study the pros and cons, the country requirement and the social impacts in order for us also to find an energy solution for the country. 
Russia is our traditional tea buyer. How is the trend of our tea trade now 
The Russian Federation is the largest tea importer in the world for the consumption with an annual intake of around 172 million kg of tea. 
In the year 2000, SL became the leading tea exporter to Russia with an export volume of 45 million kg in overtaking its close competitor, India. From the year 2000, SL continued its leading position in the market till 2014. During that period, a large portion of Ceylon tea was exported to Russia in pre-packed form. 
In 2016, a total volume of 34 million kg of tea was imported from SL to Russia with a value of USD 145 million. We experienced a decline of Ceylon tea exports to Russia by 20% and 25% in volume term and values term respectively from the year 2015. 
The decline of the Ceylon tea imports to Russia was attributed mainly to the sharp devaluation of Russian Rouble over 100% during last two years which was associated with the financial crisis in the Russian Federation which began in 2014. The situation was further aggravated by the increasing tea prices at the Colombo tea auction. 
Though the fact was that, SL Embassy joining hands with Sri Lanka Tea Board is in the process of launching a Ceylon Tea promotional campaign in Russia to arrest the declining trend of Ceylon tea exports to this country. Against this backdrop, a visit by Plantation Industries Minister Navin Dissanayake and the tea trade delegation to Russia last month to initiate the proposed Ceylon Tea promotional campaign in Russia. Now the SL Embassy in Moscow is negotiating with Cinema chains in Russia to screen the newly developed Ceylon Tea commercial as the first stage of the promotional campaign. 
In addition to the above, the SL Embassy has been organizing the participation of SL tea companies at larger food and beverages exhibitions in Russia every year enabling the SL tea exporters to find potential tea buyers. Also this mission organized the consumer promotional activities in supermarkets in Russia to make the Russian consumers aware of Ceylon tea. 
So we are quite optimistic that, with the recovery from the dwindling economic situation in Russia in the near future and launching of a Ceylon tea promotional campaign in Russia would support to increase Ceylon Tea exports to this market and make Sri Lanka the largest exporter to Russia. 
How important is Russia in todays global order 
Russia has emerged as one of the key players involved in the majority of important processes in the global arena. I think if we say the year 2016 has been under the sign of Russian President Vladimir Putin, that is correct. Moscow managed to significantly enhance its global reputation step-by-step after the collapse of the Soviet Union. 

"We have organized a Gem and Jewellery networking session for Sri Lankan exporters and Russian Buyers in the Embassy, and we have had more than 80 interested parties attending this event, and it showed us that the vacuum existed for these unique local produce"

SLGGA  - A true guiding light for young girls and women
	
Centenary celebrations of Sri Lanka Girl Guides Association
The Sri Lanka Girl Guides Association (SLGGA) celebrates a century of excellence today. In the past hundred years, it has helped a countless number of people and has empowered young girls and women islandwide.
As the only organisation that works with girls under the age of five, the SLGGA, throughout the years, has not only trained youngsters to be the agents of change, but has also conducted various projects aiding the differently-abled, providing shelter for the homeless, supporting the tsunami victims, educating women on gender based violence and helping them secure employment through training.
History
Spanning across 146 countries, the Girl Guide Movement was founded by Lord Robert Baden Powell on March 21, 1910, and supported by a staggering 10 million members. In short, it is the largest voluntary organisation for girls and young women in the world.
The movement reached the shores of Lanka in 1917 when Miss Jenny Calverley, a young teacher from England, joined the staff of Girls High School, Kandy and started the first Girl Guide Company in the school.
The spirit of Girl Guiding caught on and companies providing such training opened in Colombo, Jaffna and Galle. Girl Guiding quickly spread to the rural areas of the island.
Projects
In the span of a hundred years, the Sri Lanka Girl Guides has conducted various community service projects that have impacted society at the grassroot level. The SLGGA has made contributions to the environment and various sectors of society from the differently-abled to the homeless, to those struck with poverty, the uneducated, women in rural villages and much more. Some of these projects are showcased below.
Branch of the differently-abled (1924)
In 1924, the SLGGA opened a branch for the differently-abled after which the girl guides company was established in the School for the Deaf and Blind in Ratmalana. The branch was officially declared open in 1925. The association has been working with differently-abled girls on school and corporate levels. Girl Guide companies are running in schools including Dhayamina, Nethmithura, Chitra Lane and the School for the Deaf and Blind in Ratmalana. In recent years, SLGGA has also been working closely with the Labour and Manpower Ministry to provide employment opportunities to their differently-abled members.
Family Life Education and Community Development Project (1978)
The Family Life Education and Community Development Project was carried out in villages in different parts of the country from Galle to Jaffna. The project intends of educating the community in all aspects of health and nutrition, sanitation, immunisation, skills, population awareness and recreation. Girl Guides visited villages where no attention was given on womens health. They enlightened the villagers on the significance of nutrition for women and children.
Soup kitchens were organised at the end of every workshop. Villagers were spoken to about family planning, proper sanitation and how to appreciate the entire country. Preschools were run in each village. Women were encouraged to start income-generating projects. People were educated on family affairs.
There was marked improvement in the areas of health, income and sanitation. With women working on income generating projects, poverty levels diminished. Workshops continued until the villages were able to be self-sufficient and no longer required SLGGAs assistance. There were many spinoffs of this project including the slum and shanty upliftment initiative in Wattala and Baladhakshika Gama.
Baladhakshika Gama (1990)
Baladhakshika Gama was established in 1990 in celebration of the International Year for Shelter for the Homeless in Ganemulla, Kadawatha.
Baladhakshika Gama provided homes to ten impoverished families that were dependent on women, the breadwinners. In addition to housing these families, the women were given training in life skills at the National Training Centre which was opened adjoining the village.
Tsunami Project (2004)
The disaster management committee of the SLGGA was formed after tsunami hit Sri Lanka on December 26, 2004.
The SLGGA renovated, restocked and furnished 14 tsunami affected school libraries in the Southern and Eastern provinces, and established the Tsunami Education Support System (TESS) scholarships for tsunami victims. Food, clothes and other equipment were distributed among pregnant mothers.
Classes were conducted in sewing, embroidery and lace-making to encourage income generation amongst tsunami victims, this included widows. A Child Development Centre was set up in Kudawella, a village in Tangalle that was battered by tsunami.
Environmental Star-Rating Programme (2008)
The SLGGA teamed up with schools, which the Education Ministry labelled as the most eco-friendly institutions, to raise awareness amongst schoolchildren on the impact and consequences of global warming.
At the workshops and seminars conducted, students were educated on the measures needed to be taken to reduce the impact of global warming. Key areas that were focused included reduction of energy consumption, conservation of water, planting trees and recycling.
Stop the Violence Campaign (2011)
The Stop the ViolenceCampaign was launched globally by WAGGGS in Edinburgh, Scotland in July 2011 to end all forms of violence against girls and young women.
In Sri Lanka, the SLGGA has conducted various workshops and activities on gender based violence, child abuse and reproductive health, thereby raising awareness on the subject. These included;

	16 days of activism conducted in December every year
	
	
	Voices Against Violence activities for Girl Guides
	
	
	Empowering Adolescent Girls: Ending the Cycle of Violence sessions in Colombo and Jaffna
	
	
	Girl Up Campaign for schoolchildren launched in collaboration with the Health Ministry in October 2015
	
Women At Work, Children At School (2014)
The above programme is an ongoing project carried out by the SLGGA in the Matale District with the help of Danish guides, scouts and the NGO WAWCAS International.
The less privileged women are encouraged to become self-sufficient by providing them with entrepreneurship training and funds to start up individual income-generating projects. The project commenced in early 2014 in two villages in Matale.
Some 32 women have been able to make their families financially stable through micro-financing.
Success stories:
Renula, whose husband was an alcoholic, rented and renovated a small store with the funds provided to her. She runs this as a grocery store and makes enough money to support her family. She is paying back her start-up loan now. Her husband is no longer an alcoholic and helps his wife in her work.
Sriyani (35) was abused by her drunkard husband and brother-in-law. Her eight-year-old son has a heart problem. They are hit by abject poverty and dont have a proper place to live in. With the funds provided to her, Sriyani started cultivating paddy and ginger to support her family.
With the funds provided to Yogeshwari and her sister-in-law Susila, they started their own business, making and selling snacks. Their husbands help them distribute these snacks to neighbouring villages in trishaws. They are now striving to expand their business by putting up a bakery.
Why SLGGA is important for young girls
Being a Girl Guide does not merely mould girls to build campfires and tie knots. It is the only association that reaches out to girls at the grass-root level and educate them on what the society expects from them. It helps them build their self-confidence and creates a conducive environment to live in.
Further, it instills in them leadership skills by initiative man workshops and events that would hone their skills.
The SLGGA teaches young girls to stand up for themselves. It paves the way for young women to aid those who are less privileged. The association has left their footprint of social welfare on our little island, proving that they are an integral part of our society.

The unseen picture of  Ekadantha
	
The most docile of the tuskers in the stables of the Sri Dalada Maligawa - Ekadantha - the one tusk animal, has a vivid tale. He was brought into the Sri Dalada Maligawa stables when he was four. He had both tusks which were small, but one was decaying. No reason could be attributed as to the decay, but it never was restored, said the former Diyawadana Nilame Niranjan Wijeratne, during whose time the four-year-old Ekadnatha was brought to the Sri Dalada Maligawa. 
Their were only two other tuskers with the Sri Dalada Maligawa and with Ekadantha joining the Sri Dalada Maligawa, the stables swelled up to twelve. 
According to the former Diyawadana Nilame, there was a cabinet decision to sell three tuskers from Pinnawela in 1977. The former Health Minister Vimala Kannangara bought two, at twenty five thousand rupees. They were Ekadantha and Vasana. Ekadantha was gifted to the Sri Dalada Maligawa and Vasana to Kataragama Devale. 
The late Diyawadana Nilame Nissanka Wijeratne also bought a tusker from his personal funds at rupees twenty five thousand and gifted the animal to the Sri Dalada Maligawa - that is Kadira. He felt that Ekadantha was alone, and to keep company bought Kadira. 
The first time Ekadantha was taken in a procession of the Sri Dalada Maligawa was on the Karthika Mangalaya day in 1978. He had been trained by Mahout Seneviratne. 
Mrs. Kannangara was living in Kandy at Queens Hotel for sometime and the writer had seen her visiting the palace where Ekadantha was tied. Though some did not recognise the former Minister yet, she had an untold interest in this tusker, which she kept to herself. One day she said that only a very few people knew her as the former Minister,I gifted the tusker, because I thought the best place for this animal is the Maligawa. He could have eternal bliss by having the Sacred Relic of Gautama Buddha tied on his back, and after his period he would pass away to eternity. 
Ekadantha, the Sri Dalada Maligawa tusker is docile, but for some reason or other he cannot stand the sight of Vasana of Sri Dalada Maligawa, another tusker. Ekadantha has piercing tusks, pin pointed and the base is sound and thick. Perhaps it would be due to the one tusks that he was carrying, after the other fell off due to a decay at the very young age of about five years. 
There was one thing in his life span and that is, he could not carry the golden casket during the night peraheras. He was only tied with the golden casket during the day perahera, coming down from the Adhana Maluwa, which he did with the utmost reverence 
Because of his one tusk, he would not be taken in the night perahera, as he was not a full tusker, although he lost his tusk due to natural causes.

TUNISIA CELEBRATES 61 YEARS OF INDEPENDENCE
	
With pride and joy, Tunisia yesterday celebrated the 61st anniversary of independence. Today, we are honouring a country of more than 3,000 years of history and rich cultural heritage, the country of deep rooted traditions of openness, peace and progress. Today, we honour the sacrifices made by the Tunisians in the name of dignity, freedom and democracy. 
Sri Lanka has enjoyed a fruitful relationship with Tunisia for several years. At present, both countries place focus on rebuilding their tourism sectors. Tunisia enjoys free access to European Union markets with over 3,000 international organisations based there. Its market is conducive to overseas entrants with investors from Sri Lanka encouraged. In 2009, the World Economic Forum ranked Tunisia as the most competitive economy in Africa and the 40th in the world. Tunisia emerges as the first country in the Arab world to succeed in transition to democratic rule. The existing leadership is determined to further enhance its relations of friendship and cooperation with Tunisias traditional partners, and pledged to place Tunisias relations with emerging Asian countries among the top priorities of its foreign policy.
Honorary Consul General for Tunisia in Sri Lanka Mukthar Marikkar expressed his confidence in the signs of a growing mutual interest by the business communities of Sri Lanka. The past years have been marked by the participation of Sri Lankan business delegations visiting Tunis.
We are confident that such visits will multiply considering the opportunities that exist in our two friendly countries. We are also confident that cooperation between our two nascent democracies has the potential to grow bigger under the new Tunisian and Sri Lankan leaderships.
On this occasion, we would like to express our wishes to take ties of friendship and cooperation that happily exist between our two countries to new heights, and to invite the Sri Lankan business community to explore the tremendous opportunities that exist in Tunisia.

UK flight ban on devices to be announced
	
The UK is due to announce a cabin baggage ban on laptops, tablets and DVD players on certain passenger flights, after a similar US move.
It is understood the UK restrictions may differ from the US Department of Homeland Security's ban, although details have not yet been released.
Flights on nine airlines from 10 airports in eight Muslim-majority countries are subject to the US move.
US officials said bombs could be hidden in a series of devices.
The UK's Department for Transport refused to comment on reports of the ban.
But BBC home affairs correspondent Daniel Sandford says the expected move is "obviously part of co-ordinated action with the US".
The attempted downing of an airliner in Somalia last year was linked to a laptop device, and it appears the security precautions are an attempt to stop similar incidents, our correspondent added.
Writing on Twitter, BBC security correspondent Frank Gardner said the UK announcement was expected this afternoon and would affect direct flights from several Middle East cities.
He said - like the US ban - large electronic devices including laptops, tablets and DVD players would not be permitted in aircraft cabins but would be allowed in checked baggage.
Phones are exempt from the US restrictions.
Passengers on some 50 flights a day from some of the busiest hubs in the Middle East, Turkey and North Africa would be required to follow the new US rules.
The airlines affected by the ban are: Royal Jordanian, Egypt Air, Turkish Airlines, Saudi Arabian Airlines, Kuwait Airways, Royal Air Maroc, Qatar Airways, Emirates and Etihad Airways.
They have been given 96 hours, beginning at 07:00 GMT on Tuesday, to ban devices bigger than a mobile phone or smartphone from cabins, US officials said, adding that the ban had no end date.
The Turkish government has said the US ban is wrong and should be reversed.
The Department of Homeland Security said extremists were seeking "innovative methods" to bring down jets.
In a statement, it said the US government was "concerned about terrorists' ongoing interest in targeting commercial aviation, including transportation hubs over the past two years".
Citing the Somalia incident in February 2016, as well as the 2015 downing of a Russian airline in Egypt and attacks at airports in Brussels and Istanbul, it added: "Evaluated intelligence indicates that terrorist groups continue to target commercial aviation, to include smuggling explosive devices in various consumer items.
