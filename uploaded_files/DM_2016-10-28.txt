Apple Kills Off Old School USB Ports on New Macbook Pro
	
Apple just announced a lineup of three new MacBook Pro laptops, each of which is decked out with four USB Type-C ports. Apple both confused and stunned the world with the decision to not include an audio jack on the recent iPhone 7. Now they have decided to remove USB ports from the new Macbook Pro.
And as is the case with all things Apple these days, you know what that means  youre going to need more dongles. Apples never been shy about shaving off features in its quest for slimmer, faster computing.
More specifically, you now need an adapter (or a new cable) to plug your iPhone into the new MacBook Pro. Thats a whole new story.
A future where phones, laptops, and other products all use USB Type-C could be a great one. Certain USB-C ports can handle data and power at the same time, and a reversible universal connector that works on both ends of the cable and across products that run iOS, macOS, Android, and Windows sounds like a good future!
But that future is still out on the horizon, and to get there we have to paddle through a sea of dongles.
HDMI port is also ditched from the new Macbook Pro. So better pick up a USB-C to HDMI connector while youre at it, if you plan on connecting your notebook to an external display.
Oh almost forgot to mention, at least the new MacBook Pro has a headphone jack. Whoa!

ComBank offers exciting new look and functionality in revamped website
	
A comprehensive revamp of the website of Commercial Bank of Ceylon has dramatically changed the look and feel, as well as the functionality of the online portal through which the bank offers information as well as access to a wide range of services.
A stand-out feature of the overhaul is the websites enhanced responsiveness to access via phone devices and tabs, in acknowledgement of the growing popularity of mobile banking. New mobile-friendly interfaces and interaction allow faster and smoother access to information and tools on mobile devices.
The use of the latest technologies for animation and interaction augments speed and user experience, along with several important changes in the way information is organised and presented and made user-responsive.
The importance of the website continues to grow exponentially, because more and more people have become tech savvy and conduct their information gathering online, said Commercial Bank Deputy General Manager Marketing Hasrath Munasinghe.
The redesign of the website enables us to deploy the very latest in web development technologies to offer more to users and to reflect the newer visual identities of the bank. The visual changes that are instantly noticeable to visitors to www.combank.lk represent an adoption of current design standards and methodologies and an update of the imagery associated with the bank. Additionally, by bringing prominent visual elements that provide access to services to the forefront, Commercial Bank provides faster Internet access to visitors. Enhanced Geo-location functionality for the banks branch network enables the website to automatically pick up the locations of users who have allowed it and show them the closest available branch, with distance calculations.
The streamlining of product information through an all-inclusive mini product portal from which users can get whatever information they need without clicking through to other pages and persistent favourite pages that make it possible for users to save pages they frequently visit, significantly enhance the user experience.
Another key feature of the revamped website is a needs-based user guidance wizard, which simulates the personalised interaction experienced at a branch via a tool that captures a users needs and guides that user to the product or service that is most suitable for the requirement at hand.
Visitors to the website can now fulfil all requirements of information on products and services and also apply for these facilities by obtaining applications from the site, the bank said.

COPE report was born amid much labour: JVP
	
The Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) said today COPE had to overcome numerous problems and obstacles in its investigation into the Central Bank bond scam with the Central Bank refusing to provide certain documents to the Auditor General.
It was after a COPE directive to the Central Bank that it provided those documents. There were elements attempting to influence COPE from within even after receiving the documents. Today we have been able to submit a comprehensive report despite the obstacles, JVP leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake said.
He told a news conference that it was up to the Government including the Prime Minister to take action on the recommendations made in the COPE report and added that the JVP was closely monitoring the governments reaction to the report.
Mr. Dissanayake said the JVP was committed to ensuring that legal action would be taken against the culprits and the losses incurred in the bond scam be recovered.
The governments responsibility is to forward the recommendation of the COPE report to Attorney General to take action, he said.
Mr. Dissanayake said the JVP condemned the governments move to accuse the media of revealing certain facts on the COPE investigations into the Central Bank bond controversy and added that it should investigate the facts revealed by the media rather than pointing fingers at them.
He said the government had started to target the media so as to prevent the corruption withing the government being revealed.
The government should say if the facts revealed by the media are true rather than pointing fingers at the media. The government is targeting the media to prevent the corruption involved in providing expressway tenders and the coal deal being revealed, Mr. Dissanayake said.
He said Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe had instructed the Central Bank Governor to adopt an auction when issuing bonds instead of the direct place system according to the evidence given by Mr. Mahendran.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe has also to be faulted on this matter. He had also attempted to suppress the investigations, Mr. Dissanayake claimed. (Ajith Siriwardana)

Inappropriately dressed MP leaves chambers
	
Badulla District MP Aravindh Kumar who was wearing a dark orange shirt in Parliament was cautioned about his attire by the employees who were on duty inside the chambers yesterday.
Parliamentary sources said the employees had cautioned him saying, '"Sir your attire could cause an issue". Then the MP apparently left the chambers.
However Serjeant-at-Arms Anil Samarasekara said no one, including he and his deputy, had ordered the MP to leave the chambers.
He confirmed that the Parliamentary dress code does not allow dark coloured shirts for male MPs and said they had to wear either national dress or lounge suits when attending sessions. Female MPs must wear saris, he said.
There have been few occasions when MPs were ordered to leave the chambers as their attire was found to be inappropriate. The most recent instance concerned K Thangeswari who was ordered to leave when she came into the chambers wearing salwar kameez. A similar incident occurred when Srimani Athulathmudali came wearing a skirt and blouse in the 1990s. (Yohan Perera)

Indian boss gives 1,260 cars, 400 flats as Diwali bonus
	
A diamond tycoon in India has once again given away hundreds of cars and flats to his employees as a bonus for meeting company targets, the Guardian reported today.
Savjibhai Dholakia, who runs a diamond export firm in the booming west coast city of Surat, announced his company would give 1,260 cars, 400 flats and pieces of jewellery to his employees ahead of the Hindu festival of Diwali.
Our aim is that each employee must have his own home and car in the next five years. So we have decided to gift cars, homes and jewellery to employees, Dholakia, owner of the Hare Krishna Exports, has told AFP.
He said the rewards were in recognition of the outstanding performance and dedication shown by employees in the last five years.
The company would spend an estimated 500m rupees ($7m) under the loyalty programme to reward an unknown number of staff from a total workforce of 5,500.
Most employees receive presents of some kind from their bosses during Diwali but they are usually boxes of Indian sweets.
But Dholakia has been making headlines by giving expensive gifts to his employees since 2012, when three employees received cars for their performance.
The generous boss gave 491 cars and 207 flats to his employees under a similar programme in 2014.
The company will exclude previous years beneficiaries from the new scheme.
His firm is one of the leading polishing companies in Indias diamond hub Surat and exports diamonds to some 75 countries.

## Title: Lets talk Contraception

Lets talk Contraception
	

By Kalani Kumarasinghe 
Despite improved access to information and knowledge, discussing sexual and reproductive health is still a social and cultural taboo for most Sri Lankans. The Annual World Contraception Day campaign attempts to raise awareness about contraception and safe sex. The objective is to enable youth and adults alike to make informed decisions until every pregnancy is a wanted one. In an interview with the Daily Mirror, Consultant Obstetrician and Gynaecologist, Colombo University Medicine Faculty, Professor Hemantha Dodampahala uncovers various myths and misconceptions surrounding contraception and why it is vital to make informed choices.

QWhy is contraception important
Contraception is frequently used in developed countries between unmarried partners. Besides this, there are also provisions for the termination of unwanted pregnancies. But in most developing countries, especially in Asia, the termination of a pregnancy is illegal due to various religious and social implications. Therefore, contraception and the knowledge of contraception are important for every woman and man. The world is experiencing a population explosion, particularly in third world countries.

QHow can contraception be classified
Contraceptive methods can be divided as non-contraceptive intervention and contraceptive intervention, permanent and temporary methods. Even though Abstention remains an important part of contraception, the practicality of this method is very much debatable. Some couples avoid sexual intercourse during the so-called fertile period. This is referred to as the Calendar method, and stands as the most popular technique of contraception in this country.

QHow does each individual identify which method of contraception fits them best
For young women, regardless of the marital status, the use of an Oral Contraceptive Pill (OCP) is the ideal choice. This is also recommended for a young married woman who wants to delay a pregnancy for one or two years. This tablet must be taken every day. If you miss a pill, take two pills as soon as you remember it. Missing more than two pills, you need to seek the advice of a doctor.

QWhat is your opinion on the various misconceptions surrounding this method
There are misunderstandings among women that the use of OCP will lead to permanent infertility. Such theories are time-proven and scientifically disqualified. Even after years of use, women can still regain their ovulation and conception capability. So there is absolutely no risk of infertility or sub-fertility due to the prolonged use of OCP. However, please do remember the pill will not protect you from STDs including HIV. If you ever have to have sex with a person whom you dont know, for an instance when travelling abroad, use a condom during the whole period of sexual intercourse is advised.

QHow and why should married couples with children use contraception
It is an important duty for a couple to have children, at least three per family, because there is a negative population explosion taking place in the country. A woman who has one to five children must consider using an Intra Uterine Contraceptive Device (IUCD). This device is placed in the womb which will not have any hormonal effects on the body. Women can also opt for injectable-implants. This method does not interfere with the day-to-day sexual activity and can be used up to five years.

QWhen is the use of Emergency Contraception appropriate
Sometimes with unforeseen circumstances, married or unmarried couples have unprotected sex. In such instances, according to the common practice in Sri Lanka, the woman must take two tablets of Levonorgestrel 750 micrograms, 12 hours apart within the first 72 hours of having unprotected sex. If a woman forgets to take the second tablet, she can still take it up to the first 100 hours, but the success rate will drop from 95% to 75%. All these methods can increase the risk of conception at an abnormal site. Such as ectopic pregnancy when a fertilised egg implants outside the uterus.
However, even if you find yourself pregnant after taking Levonorgestrel, there is no cause for worry. I have seen many such patients.

Mahendran responsible for CB Bond scam: COPE report
	
The parliamentary Committee on Public Enterprises (COPE), in its final report on the investigation into the Central Bank bond controversy, held former Central Bank Governor Arjun Mahendran directly responsible for the questionable transaction and called for legal action.
It said there was evidence which gives credence to the allegation that Mr. Mahendran interfered and influenced the process.
After the report consisting of 55 pages supported by 2000 annexes was presented to Parliament, its Chairman JVP MP Sunil Handunnetti read out the recommendations agreed upon by all 26 members.
The COPE stated that there was a lack of transparency on the bond issue that took place on February 27 last year and that the credibility of the Central Bank had suffered as a result.
It recommended legal action on this matter and observed that bond trader, 'Perpetual Treasuries' had made a huge profit within a short span of time .
It also recommended legal investigations and stressed the need for Parliament to monitor the follow- up action by law enforcement agencies and carry out progress reviews.
COPE recommended a mechanism to prevent the repetition of such irregularities in the future and requested the President to set up a system to supervise the awarding of such tenders by the Central Bank.
It also recommended that the financial loss caused to the government should be recovered from those responsible and called for a separate investigation by the Central Bank to determine how Perpetual Treasuries made such a huge profit within such a short time.
COPE stressed the need to evolve fresh legislation to ensure transparency where such transactions are concerned leaving no room for the credibility of the Central Bank to be tarnished. (Kelum Bandara and Yohan Perera )

MPs abstained from voting due to dictatorial manner of govt-MR
	
Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa on Thursday charged that many Parliamentarians, even those who were within government ranks, had abstained from voting for the VAT Bill on Wednesday (27), as this Yahapalanaya government was not listening to anyone but doing things in a dictatorial manner.
It is clear that there are concerns even from the government ranks. These members are afraid to vote against this bill in Parliament, fearing they would be punished by the party's hierarchy if they do, the former President said in reply to a question from media posed to him as he emerged from a meeting in Galle.

Speaking further, the former President remarked by now everyone knows who the guilty parties are in the CB bond scam after the release of the COPE report. Even the UNP members have accepted the report now that it has been proved. The company responsible may be charged for this act. He referred to the VAT bill and said that even the health services had not been spared. They could have taken over the millions they proclaim I have stashed away and avoided this VAT Amendment Bill. This government has no humanitarian values. They do not understand the peoples difficulties and their wants. We have been saying for a long time that National security should be strengthened. In order to do this they have to activate intelligence units, establish army camps and also strengthen the police and the security aparatus.( Nimal Algewatta-Habaraduwa)

Murder of kids: Madras HC imposes life sentence on SL refugee
	
Shocked over the ghastly murder of a 12-year-old boy and his seven-year-old sister for resisting an attempt to rob their house and the inability of police to crack the case on their own, the Madras High Court Bench has confirmed the conviction and life sentence imposed on a Sri Lankan refugee solely on the basis of his extra-judicial confession to a Tahsildar.
However, a Division Bench of Justices S. Nagamuthu and M.V. Muralidaran set aside the conviction and life imprisonment imposed by a trial court on the co-convict on the ground that the confession made by the prime accused could not be used against his supposed accomplice in the absence of independent materials to prove his involvement in the crime.
The judges said the siblings, K. Ramprakash and K. Deepika, were taking care of their house at GRV Nagar in Pasupathipalayam in Karur district on May 17, 2007 after their father Karthikeyan, a Field Officer for Life Insurance Corporation, and mother K. Jeyanthi, a schoolteacher, left for work.
In the afternoon, their neighbours found the bodies of the children lying in a pool of blood inside the house and alerted their father, who, in turn, lodged a complaint with police. The investigators could not solve the case for three years despite having used the services of a sniffer dog and fingerprint experts, and receipt of post-mortem report.
On February 2, 2010, driven by conscience, the prime accused, Murali alias Thiyagarajan, an inmate of a Srilankan refugee camp at Rayanur, met the Karur Tahsildar and confessed to have murdered the children.
He said the crime was committed with the assistance of two others, Kumar alias Vijayakumar and Pandi alias Thangapandi. The trio, however, could not find any valuables, except for a silver coin, in the house. It was only after the voluntary confession, the police arrested all the three and recovered the silver coin from a pawn shop.
A Mahila Court in Karur convicted them for the double murder and sentenced them to life on June 12, 2015 though only Thiyagarajan and Thangapandi had preferred the present appeals on the ground that the extra-judicial confession was a weak piece of evidence and there was no probability of the confession having been made to a stranger.
The Division Bench said the Tahsildar could not be termed a stranger since he was a regular visitor to the camp and there was no need for corroboration when the confession inspired the confidence of the court.(The Hindu)

Take these facts to  heart
	

By Sarah Muiz - Pics by Nisal Baduge
Cancer, cardiovascular, respiratory and kidney diseases are the most significant conditions among Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs). Nevertheless, cardiovascular diseases have been recognised as the main cause of deaths due to NCDs. Hence, September 29 marks the World Heart Day, with the aim to increase public awareness on cardiovascular diseases and how to prevent them. Speaking to the Daily Mirror, Cardiologist Dr. Anidu Pathirana, representing the Institute of Cardiology, National Hospital of Sri Lanka, explained the complications of cardiovascular diseases in a broader perspective. While emphasizing the need to raise more awareness among the public concerning heart diseases, Dr. Pathirana highlighted that cardiovascular diseases could be considered a number one cause leading to premature deaths. Excerpts of the intervieware as follows: 

QCould you explain what cardiovascular diseasesare and how detrimental they could be
Cardiovascular diseases are diseases of the heart and blood vessels connected to the heart. It is largely part of what we refer to as Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs). The attention has been shifted more towards NCDs under the present context. They have become the leading cause of deaths, exceeding the deaths due to infections and natural catastrophes. There seems to be an increasing tendency for the prevalence of NCDs among people than communicable diseases. This is the primary reason why people are interested in taking preventing measures against them. Most of the deaths that take place at present due to heart diseases are premature deaths which are a serious concern to be dealt with. Even if a person is lucky to survive a disease, the chances are that such a person would be faced with some kind of disability for the rest of his or her life, and will have to depend on long-term medication. As a whole, this also puts a lot of strain on the health economics of a nation. 

QWhat are the main cardiovascular diseases and what causes them
Although there are many diseases that affect the heart and blood vessels, the two main diseases are heart attacks caused by diseases affecting the blood vessels supplying blood to the heart and strokes or brain attacks; that again occur due to issues with blood supply to a part of the brain. These two are the most dreaded among cardiovascular diseases. Narrowing of the blood vessels is the main cause leading to these types of conditions. This happens when fatty material, commonly known as cholesterol, gets deposited in the walls of blood vessels causing them to contract. 

Scientists have found out that certain factors increase the chances of cardiovascular diseases. They are called risk factors. Among them, the factors that cannot be changed are ageing, genetic makeup and the male sex who are more vulnerable to heart diseases in comparison to women. However, there are many other risk factors that can be avoided or changed. High blood pressure, high cholesterol levels, diabetes, being exposed to any tobacco product, unhealthy diet, lack of physical activities, being obese and long-term mental imbalance are such risk factors that can be modified for the better. Although when taken in excessive amounts alcohol could be harmful, there are certain beneficial effects of it if taken in verysmall quantities. 

Even if a person is lucky to survive a disease, the chances are that such a person would be faced with some kind of disability for the rest of his or her life, and will have to depend on long-term medication

QWhat are the vulnerable age groups exposed to these diseases
The narrowing of the blood vessels is a gradual process that may start very early in life. This could commence as early as adolescence. Narrowing of blood vessels goes on gradually. However, the pace at which this happens can differ from one person to another. If an individual is very much exposed to other risk factors, the speed at which he or she would be vulnerable to cardiovascular diseases is higher than in an ordinary person.
Therefore, since childhood, people should adhere to healthy lifestyle practices. Most of the aforementioned risk factors like diet, physical activities, mental stress and obesity are lifestyle-driven. Our lifestyle also has bearing-on factors such as cholesterol, diabetes and high blood pressure, which could result in heart diseases eventually. In terms of preventive measures, the best we could do is adopting a healthylifestyle pattern. 

QDo you think coconut oil is good for health when compared with other oils
There are mixed feelings with regard to the use of coconut oil according to evidence-based sciences. There isnt sufficient research conducted on the subject of coconut oil, although whatever the data available contain mixed beliefs concerning its good and bad aspects for health. Coconut oil is mainly made of saturated fat. Generally, there are four types of fats known as saturated, monounsaturated, polyunsaturated and trans. If you want to make a healthy choice based on the fat composition, you have to avoid trans fat completely. Trans fat is found in chemically-processed food. If you find the term partially-hydrogenated among the ingredients of a food label, remember that they contain a lot of trans fat. Margarine, biscuits, snacks including potato chips contain a lot of trans fat despite being the modern trend in food consumption. 


Although when taken in excessive amounts alcohol could be harmful, there are certain beneficial effects of it if taken in very small quantities 


On the other hand, we must limit saturated fat derived mainly from animal food products and some plant products (mainly coconut and palm). Since coconut oil contains saturated fat, people believe that we should limit its consumption. However, it should be noted that coconut oil contains fairly heat-stabled saturated fat. This kind of fat, when heated, does not change its chemical composition due to temperature variations, unlike the polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fat. Although not recommended to consume in excessive amounts, coconut oil is considered an important source of calories or energy in our country since our dietary culture is mainly rice and coconut based. In the case of virgin coconut oil, the oil is extracted without increasing the temperature during the manufacturing process. This helps in preserving the chemical nature of the oil without much alteration. Therefore, virgin coconut oil is a better choice in food preparation. Oils are best consumed in raw form directly added to salads without heating and altering their chemical composition 

QWhat are the precautionary measures to be followed to prevent cardiovascular diseases
It is important that an individual goes for a regular body checkup to ensure that blood pressure, sugar and cholesterol levels are under normal levels because these are direct risk factors contributing to cardiovascular diseases. It is advisable for a person beyond eighteen years of age to get himself or herself a medical checkup done at least once in two years. In case your family members have additional risk factors, it is better to go for a medical checkup every year. Avoid sugary beverages as much as possible, and eat a healthy diet that constitutes mostly of fruits and vegetables. Physical activities will also help in preventing the risk of cardiovascular diseases. 
QDo you have any idea about the number of individuals suffering from heart diseases in Sri Lanka
In Sri Lanka, statistics are not up-to-date. However, statistics shows that deaths due to NCDs account for more than fifty per cent of deaths worldwide. Therefore, WHO declared that we should do everything possible to reduce premature deaths caused due to NCDs by twenty five per cent by year 2025. 

QHas the National Cardiology Unit conducted any research in this subject area
As mentioned earlier, an unhealthy diet could be a risk factor contributing to cardiovascular disease. When it comes to diet, it is the portion size that matters more than the type of food consumed. Even healthy food if taken in excess could have unhealthy effects on an individual. A diagram depicting a Healthy Plate with the portions/quantities of each food item that should be consumed was introduced recently by the Health Ministry. Their main aim is to cut down the excess consumption of carbohydrates. Accordingly, an individual should not eat more than half of rice in the plate. We are currently focusing on reducing the portion size of the food consumed for heart attack patients. We advise them on the quantity of food they should take in, including what they should eat. This is being conducted as a research for the first time. However, as part of our research, we have applied stringent standards with regard to the starch intake, limiting it to about 1/3 of the plate. We have to wait for the results of the investigation before introducing it to the patients.

The battle against congenital malformations of the heart

When inquired about how critical the health condition of children diagnosed with heart diseases in Sri Lanka is, Heart Surgeon Dr. Conal Austin of the Mercy Mission medical team says as a doctor specializing in children with congenital malformations of the heart which are also known as Congenital Heart Defects (CHD), a structurally abnormal heart, what he sees in young patients is quite different from what other heart surgeons see in adult patients who have developed disease of the coronary arteries or the disease of the aortic valves.
The children we operate are born with malformations of the heart. There is a multitude of different types of malformations of the heart, and the ones we see here are often related to obstructions of the blood flow to the lungs which makes the children blue. We have been focusing on improving the blood supply to the heart and closing holes inside the heart in most of the operations we have carried so far. We are hopefully of operating twenty patients over the next seven days. Up to now, we have conducted ten heart surgeries, Dr. Austin said.


Newborns are one of the commonest groups diagnosed with malformations of the heart

Speaking to the Daily Mirror, Cardiologist Prof. John Simpson who plays a proactive role along with Dr. Austin in conducting heart surgeries said that in most cases it was unknown as to why a child may be diagnosed with a malformation of the heart although in some cases the reason may be related to a genetic condition.
For an example, about half the children with Down Syndrome are diagnosed with a malformation of the heart. Therefore, we can explain the heart condition of a child with Down syndrome. As for genetics, many children dont have an obvious genetic condition. Ailments run in families, sometimes in which case malformations of the heart would be quite common. If we take newborn babies, one in two hundred babies will have a heart problem that we will need to do something about. Newborns are one of the commonest groups diagnosed with malformations of the heart. It is also one of the most important causes of disability leading to death if we dont intervene and treat it on time, Prof. Simpson said.
Prof. Simpson said in comparison to children diagnosed with heart diseases in England, the number of similar incidents reported in Sri Lanka was slightly higher. He said some types of malformation that were common locally were rarely evident in UK and vice versa. However, he noted that overall the cases of malformation evident locally were not dissimilar to the cases in the UK.
During my lectures at the Lady Ridgeway Hospital on the subject, the doctors maintained a very good overview of the setup and health services that they have implemented within Sri Lanka.
Compared to when we first visited Sri Lanka fourteen years ago, there is a great amount of effort and work that has been put in by local doctors to try and create more awareness on heart diseases while catering to young patients in a successful manner. We have got a few substantial donations from the UK to help carry out our charity work in Sri Lanka, and we are very grateful to all our volunteers and donors for their kindness Prof. Simpson added.

UB Finance has a reputation for strength and stability within the financial services arena, which is supported through its competitive edge of being the first finance company in Sri Lanka to be backed by a private sector commercial bank. As a Union Bank company, UB Finance leverages on the expertise of Union Bank for guidance in operations.
The company has also built its reputation on strong connections with local communities and stakeholders and through a well distributed network with a presence in 16 location points across Sri Lanka.

Union Bank 3Q net up 74% to Rs.133mn; but margins decline
	
Union Bank of Colombo PLC saw its net profits for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 (3Q16) rising as much as 74 percent to Rs.133.2 million from a year ago, on the back of modest growth seen in the banks loan book but the margins came under further pressure as interest rates rose, the interim financial accounts released to the Colombo Stock Exchange showed.
The earnings per share rose to 12 cents from 7 cents. The banks share closed 10 cents or 0.62 percent lower at Rs.16.10 during yesterdays trading.
The bank on a standalone basis saw its gross loans and advances rising 30 percent or Rs.12.3 billion during the nine months to Rs.53 billionlittle under Rs.1.4 billion disbursements a month. But the banks net interest margin came further under pressure as it fell under 3.0 percent to 2.79 percent from 3.37 percent at the beginning of the financial year.
The deposits grew by 32 percent or Rs.11.9 billion while the low-cost, current and savings accounts (CASA) ratio stood little under 24 percent. The industry average hovers around 37 percent, which is also down from around 42 percent at the beginning of the year, as people shifted from low interest earning savings accounts to high yielding fixed deposits when the market interest rates rose.
But this put pressure on the margins of the banking sector as the sector margins also came down to around 3.5 percent by the end of the first eight months, hence the banks were fighting to maintain the bottom line by repricing its assets and liabilities. Union Banks net interest income however grew 34 percent year-on-year (YoY) to Rs.806.2 million. But the net fee and commission income, which generally cushions the narrowing margins, dropped 4 percent you to Rs.106.1 million. The bank had gains from the trading from the investments and foreign exchange better than what it enjoyed during the same quarter last year. The bank has zero exposure to equity investments.
For the nine months ended September 30, the bank posted a net profit of Rs.367.8 million, up 154 percent YoY. The earnings per share rose to 34 cents from 13 cents.
Meanwhile, the banks provisions made against the possible bad loans in respect of individual customers saw an increase of 54 percent YoY to Rs.45.8 million but the asset quality improved as the gross non-performing loans ratio dropped to 2.73 percent from 3.55 percent at the end of 2015. The bank, which has the backing of US-based Culture Financial Holdings Limited, had its Tier I and Tier II capital adequacy ratios at 23.03 percent and 22.38 percent, respectively, by the end of September, well above the minimum requirements of 5 percent and 10 percent each.
Culture Financial holds a 70 percent stake in the bank.
The Central Bank along with the Finance Ministry are said to be contemplating to further increase the minimum core capital of licensed commercial banks to Rs.20 billion from the current Rs.10 billion; such a move will nothing but force some of the small and mid-sized banks to merge with other well capitalized banks.

Youth's death; Wimal rejects comments on social media
	
Rejecting the comments made on social media against his family in connection with the death of a youth, who was a close family friend, MP Wimal Weerawansa said it was appalling to note that his political rivals were trying to score points through such an unfortunate tragedy.
In a Facebook post Mr. Weerawansa stated that the youth Lahiru Janith, was his neighbor and a close friend of his son and was a frequent visitor to his house.
He was at my place on the day of his death and I was out of the city. Group of my sons friends including Lahiru had watched a movie after the dinner and had gone to sleep. Unfortunately, he had died at my place the same night, he said.
Mr. Weerawansa said several political enemies are trying to frame my family by misinterpreting this incident even after releasing the postmortem examination as the youth died at his residence.
In the postmortem report it was clearly mentioned that this youth died of natural causes and it was from a heart attack. His body parts have also been forwarded to the Government Analyst to find the reason behind his heart attack, he said.
