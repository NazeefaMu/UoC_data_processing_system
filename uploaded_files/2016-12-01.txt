'Avaa ? Giyaa' quips Jaffna District DIG
	
An event to honour and felicitate the Police Officers who had excelled in their assigned duties was held at the Jaffna Police Station yesterday.
When DIG Sanjeeva Dharmaratna who presided over the event was questioned by the media personnel present there about the activities of the ?Avaa? group, he modestly said ?Avaa ? Giyaa?, meaning the group was non-existent now. The word ?Avaa? in Sinhala denoted the meaning ?came? while the word ?Giyaa? meant ?left?.
There were many schools of thought for the sword attacks that took place during the last few months in Jaffna and it was also pointed out that the ?Avaa? group was responsible for them.
The ?Avaa? group that claimed responsibility for the sword attack inflicted upon the Policemen in Chunnakam in October put up posters to that effect in various places there.
Meanwhile, it was urged that the sword attacks were carried out by the ?Avaa? group and action should be taken to curtail their activities. Accordingly, a special Police squad dispatched from Colombo to Jaffna had arrested some youth alleged to be sympathisers of ?Avaa? group and were remanded as ordered by Court. However, they were bailed out yesterday. (Sornakumar Soruban)

Be mentally strong to play through the pain, Akram tells Sri Lankan fast bowlers
	
Bowling legend Wasim Akram who was in Sri Lanka for a short training session called for mental toughness to see through constant pain barriers the fast bowlers go through, if they are to be successful in fast bowling.
?Fast bowler, doesn?t matter how old is he, 17, 19, 24 and 35+, you will have niggles, sore backs, hamstring injuries, sore shoulders,? Akram said addressing the media in Colombo. ?So a little bit pain, little bit headache or fever and suddenly say I?m not playing the test match. I said, I?m going to play the game, after one session, everything is back to normal. Now a days what?s happening is a little niggle they say I am not playing,? he added.
Akram, 50, conducted a day-long coaching clinic in Colombo on Thursday, in what would be the first of a series of programmes involving foreign experts. He is expected to visit Sri Lanka at least twice a year to conduct such coaching sessions as Sri Lanka Cricket looks to foreign experts to help the local talent.

Bus and train strike from midnight today
	
The Inter-Provincial Private Bus Association (IPPBA) and the Railway Employees? Trade Union Federation (RETUF) are to begin countrywide bus and train strikes from midnight today.
IPPBA president Sarath Vijitha Kumara said there would be a countrywide bus strike if the government did not rescind the proposal to impose a fine of Rs.25,000 for certain traffic offences.
He said the strike would last for five days if the President did not intervene to settle the matter.
Transport Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva announced on Monday that the Government would impose such a fine in respect of traffic offences such as speeding, drunk driving and overtaking on the left.
The strike is to be launched by all bus associations, in collaboration with motorcycle associations and container associations, in 16 districts.
Meanwhile, the Railway Employees? Trade Union Federation convener Janaka Fernando said they would launch a 24-hour countrywide token strike from midnight today over several demands.
He said the token strike was mainly to express their opposition to the granting of Railway Department land to the private sector, the proposal to set up a land bank, irregular recruitment, the abolishing of pensioners? rights and the proposed Railway Development Council.
He said the government pension scheme was established during the colonial era and not by a government elected after independence. The pension scheme was intended to protect public servants after retirement, and their families after their death.
?As a federation we are urging the government to safeguard the pension scheme and not abolish it,? he said.
He said the work stoppage would be only for a day because they did not want to inconvenience students sitting the GCE (Ordinary Level) Examination as most of the students travel by train to reach their examination centres. ?Our trade union action will continue after the examinations,? he said.

## Title: Devastation of forest cover causes irreparable environmental damage

Devastation of forest cover causes irreparable environmental damage
	
?
Environmentalists raise concern over the imminent devastation of forest coverage and the resultant loss of biodiversity due to the mining of quartz deposit in the Kotikambokka Kosgahawela Forest Reserve in Wellawaya, and also about the road being laid through the forest to access the quartz deposit.?
They blame the Geological Survey and Mines Bureau (GSMB) for approving a private company allied to the bureau to engage in the task.?
Mahaweli Development and Environment Ministry Secretary Udaya R. Seneviratne, in a letter sent on March 10, 2016, had instructed the GSMB Chairman to make necessary arrangements to commence the mining of the quartz deposit and construction of the access road as this decision was taken by the President at the progress review meeting of the Environment Ministry on March 31 this year.?
Environmentalists say this project to exploit quartz deposit in an environmentally-significant sensitive forest area of Kotikambokka in Ethiliwewa Beat of the forest reserve, which comes under the purview of the Forest Conservation Department, would lead to many environmental and social problems. This is a natural forest area and habitat for biodiversity system consisting of endemic species.?
The Kotikambokka Forest Reserve is an inter-zone forest, mixed with Savannah grass land. Environmentalists claim Gammalu, Aralu, Bulu Welan, Milla and Dada Kirala are prominent among the flora of this forest range and various kinds of orchids unique to the country are found here.?
Damages undergone by this environmental system since 2010, due to the activities of individuals and companies on political influences, would be aggravated by the clearing of sensitive wet layers of the forest to build the road to access the quartz deposit.?
Meanwhile, Raja Vidana Pathirana of the Monaragala Nature Foundation said for the eight-metre wide 400-metre road, a strip of forest was to be cleared along the north boundary of the Alikota Ara Reservoir under the Uma Oya multi-purpose scheme, of which construction was now in progress.?
He said some 250-300 well-grown and valuable trees were to be cut and uprooted in a bid to clear the path, disturbing the existence of biodiversity in and around.?
Further, he said the need for the access road had arisen due to the construction of the new Alikota Ara Reservoir of the Uma Oya Project.?
However, Uma Oya Project Manager Engineer P.M.M.P.S.D. Herath had sent a letter to the Monaragala District Forest Officer on August 13, explaining the probable adverse effects on the new reservoir in clearing the forest cover on site of quartz deposit and the Kosgahawela Forest Reserve. However, Technological Services Private Limited (TSC) of the GSMB has sought approval for a land area of two hectares for mining of the quartz deposit in the Kosgahawela Forest Reserve.?
According to the No. 722/22 Gazette notification issued on June 24, 1993, under the No. 47 of 1980 Environment Act, ministry approval has to be obtained after an Environment Impact Assessment (EIA). However, the TSC seems to begin the mining activities without an EIA, taking the advantage of political influence as revealed.?
However, severe damage to the dam of the reservoir is inevitable when the blasting is done in mining the quartz deposit. The Kosgahawela Forest Reserve where this quartz deposit is located and the reservoir are fed with water from the Alikota Ara canal.?
Clearing of forest cover in these areas would cause soil erosion, and the deposit of sediments in the reservoir would dwindle the water storage capacity of the reservoir in a short span of time.?
However, when we contacted Monaragala District D.P. Prasad and asked about the mining of the quartz deposit, he affirmed beginning of the proposed project. He said the forest area had already experienced a considerable environmental damage due to several improper mining done on several occasions in the past.?
He pointed out that inappropriate mining would cause severe damage to this sensitive environment system, and that it was advisable to begin the mining operation after studying an environmental impact report. However, he declined to explain further. Meanwhile, the environmentalists said those interested in achieving economic gains in a short period of time had misled the President who was also the Environment Minister, thus ignoring the irreparable loss to the entire country in the long run.?
They also stressed the importance of the President?s attention with regards to these sensitive environmental concerns.?

## Title: Dispelling myths about vitamin supplements

Dispelling myths about vitamin supplements
	
?
By Amra Ismail
Vitamins are an essential micro-nutrient which the human body requires in small quantities. If the required level of vitamins is not fulfilled, it could lead to a vitamin deficiency where vitamin supplements are administered.?
There is a a growing trend today to purchase vitamins over the counter without medical advice. At the same time, there are many myths surrounding vitamins causing people to spend large amounts of money so as to receive additional health benefits.?
Dispelling myths associated with vitamins, Dr. N. Kumaranayake, Clinical Psychiatrist of the Kiribathgoda Base Hospital, said that though people were skeptical before taking conventional treatment, the same skepticism did not apply to alternative medicine. ?People believe that popping a vitamin supplement is beneficial to health.
?
Vitamin C
Speaking about Vitamin C which he believed to be the ?commonly abused vitamin?, Dr. Kumaranayake said that contrary to popular belief, the supplement did not ward off the common cold.
?People believe vitamin C prevents common colds. This is not true. More than 30 trials conducted with over 10,000 participants have examined the effect of taking vitamin C daily in doses up to 2g a day. The conclusion derived was that vitamins did not prevent or treat the common cold.? He also said an excess of vitamin C caused kidney stones. ?If you eat 2 bananas a day, the requirement is fulfilled,? he added. ?
?
Folic Acid
?
Dr. Kumaranayake added that taking large doses of Folic acid had long-term consequences. ?Folic acid assists in the development of the human body. It helps in producing genetic material such as DNA as well. Folic acid is mostly safe when taken by mouth. Most adults don?t experience side effects when less than 1000mg a day is taken. However It?s dangerous when larger doses are taken,? he said. ??
According to him, taking large doses could lead to abdominal cramps, diarrhea, rash, sleep disorders, irritability, nausea, confusion, behavioral changes and fits.?Research also suggests that taking Folic acid within the range of 800 and 1200mg might increase the risk of heart attacks in people who have heart problems. Research also points towards a possible increase in the risk of lung and prostrate cancer.? ??
?
A and E vitamins
?Studies have shown that antioxidant supplements including vitamin A and E didn?t possess preventive effects and may possess unwanted harmful consequences to health,? said Dr. Kumaranayake. ??
He added that research showed 400 international units of Vitamin E daily for seven years increased the risk of developing prostate cancer in men. He also said it could increase the risk of developing a concussion.
?Taking excessive amounts of vitamin A during pregnancy could harm the baby as well. ??
?People who market vitamins propagate that hairfall is caused due to a vitamin deficiency. This is a myth. Baldness is due to male hormones such as androgen. Hair fall is also caused by stress, depression and iron deficiency,? he explained.
??
?The best source of Vitamin A and E comes from our diet and not from pills and tablets. The requirement is fulfilled by consuming foods like avocado and nuts,? he asserted. ??
?
Essential vitamins
He also expressed his views on essential vitamins which research has found to be lacking in most people. ?Several trials and studies show that Omega 3 and Vitamin D are the most promising vitamins to provide a wide range of health benefits. We recommend that you get 1500mg of DHA daily and more than 2000 international units of vitamin D to maintain these levels. It?s better to measure the intake and take them because they?re essential. However, Vitamin D is fat soluble. So if you take it excessively it could be harmful,? he said. ??
He further added that if Omega 3 and Vitamin D were obtained through natural means such as by consuming salmon, leenna and by being exposed to the tropical sun, there was no necessity to take supplements. ??
?
Psychological aspect
?People believe expensive vitamins are beneficial, that they help you live longer, makes you energetic, that it?s a magic drug. But it is not so,? expressed Dr. Kumaranayake. ??
He added that vitamins did not relieve people of stress and fatigue. ?Recently, a company manager told me that he had depression for few months.?
However before being depressed, he had taken vitamins for six months to relieve himself of fatigue and irritability which he assumed was a result of vitamin deficiency. He had bought vitamins without the prescription of a doctor.?
I started treating him for depression and asked him to do some exercise. Within weeks he was energetic and was able to resume his previous life with a positive outlook.? ??
Pointing out that at times doctors were also at fault, he said, ?When you complain to a doctor that you feel tired all the time, the doctor prescribes vitamins. He does not ask the patient about anxiety, depression or stress.? ??
?
Who should take vitamins?
?Vitamins have to be recommended by doctors. Pregnant women are prescribed with supplements to overcome Iron deficiency. Folic acid is also prescribed because the requirement is more.
Supplements are recommended during lactation as well,? said Dr. Kumaranayake. ? ?In Sri Lanka, 35% of schoolchildren are malnourished.?
They need supplements. When children study and if their diet is not very nutritious, supplements could be recommended to meet the requirement. But it has to be prescibed by doctors,? he added.
??
Stating that vitamins were a multi-billion profit-making industry, he recommended that people should consume green leaves, kola kenda, fish and vegetables which consist of natural vitamins, minerals and fibres. ??

Lankan finance dept.?s not sacred of automation or AI: CIMA study
	
Despite the popular fears which range from job losses to doomsday scenarios, Sri Lanka?s finance professionals welcome the rise of artificial intelligence (AI), automation and robots, according to the latest survey by the Chartered Institute of Management?
Accountants (CIMA).?
The results of the poll of 1,628 CIMA members reveal that 83 percent support the idea of more automation if it saves time and money or helps with indecision in their organisations. This indicates that accountants regard the impact of new technologies as an opportunity rather than?
a threat. When asked about the effect of such innovation on businesses, management accountants were most likely to state that the outcome would be a better work-life balance as computers will take over jobs while humans continue to reap the profit 68 percent, followed by more efficient companies as a result of better automation and data analysis 65 percent. ?More than one third even feels that there will be a general up-skilling of the workforce due to the need for more advanced computer skills. ?
Only 40 percent of surveyed CIMA members believe that the increased automation will lead to a loss of jobs and therefore to greater inequality. This is in stark contrast to the popular view that major job cuts will happen over the coming years as a result of automation and a rise in robotics.?
While 32 percent answered that a reliance on automation or technology has led to their organisation taking the wrong decision in the past five years, 35 percent said this has never happened as they know that they cannot solely rely on automated processes. Instead, results are double-checked.?
CIMA CEO Andrew Harding FCMA, CGMA, said, ?While it?s possible to imagine a nightmare scenario where advances in technology lead to mass redundancies, the world?s finance departments have a less alarmist view. Our members believe that artificial intelligence, robots and other technologies will alter but not destroy the jobs of accountants and other professionals. Organisations need to examine their business models and turn innovations such as artificial intelligence and automation into an opportunity not a threat.?
?There is precedent to support the idea that new technologies will make lives easier. Ever since the invention of the printing press ? which led to unemployment for scribes but opened the door to mass education ? major disruptions can be seen to have a short-term shock but deliver long-term benefit. The challenge for businesses, as always, is to use change to?
their advantage.?

In ?ek hadaki ek jeewithaki? the authors first describe the make-up of the human heart and its functions. It also describes the common ailments of the heart. The books also explain the symptoms and methods of the diagnosis of heart ailments. The detailed accounts of tests doctors order to check ones heart is particularly useful for persons with heart disease and their families.

MR has the ability to rescue Sri Lanka: Basil
	
Former president Mahinda Rajapaksa has the ability to rescue Sri Lanka from the downfall which would be faced by the country in the near future, the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) claimed today.
Addressing the media in the recruiting of members to the SLPP, former minister and SLPP front-liner Basil Rajapaksa said the county was heading towards a dark era unlike in the governing period of former president Rajapaksa.
?It is not former president Rajapaksa who is in need to govern this country again, but it is the country which need the guidance of him to bring back the country out the dark era which we are experiencing at present,? he added.
At the event, three trade unions from the Urban Development Authority, Ceylon German Technical Training Institute and the Sevanagala Sugar factory and several former Provincial Council members were offered with the membership cards of the SLPP.
A collective of youths named ?Hadawathe Janadhipathi - Mahinda? had also being registered to the SLPP and were given the membership cards.
Meanwhile, conducting a media briefing on media freedom and its suppression by the government, the SLPP said the government was in a mission to ban media by creating the necessity to regulate media institutions.
Addressing the media briefing, media expert Kula Sri Kariyawasam said it was not a surprise to experience authoritarian media suppression from the government since it was a United National Party (UNP) based government.
?The government?s hatred towards the media is evident from the behaviour of the President and the Prime Minister. However, when the government came to power they had assured the people of complete media freedom. Unfortunately they are practising its opposite now? he added. (Kalathma Jayawardhane

Officials from the Sri Lankan Embassy in Washington will be sent to California to investigate the alleged spending of Rs 27 million on a residence for the Consul General in Los Angeles at the time the post fell vacant in 2013, informed sources said today.
This comes in the wake of Foreign Affairs Minister Mangala Samaraweera disclosing in Parliament on Wednesday that Rs.27 million had been spent for the utility bills of this residence even though there was no consul general occupying the residence.
He alleged that former defense secretary Gotanaya Rajapaksa's son had occupied this residence during this time.
However Mr. Rajapaksa denied this allegation.(Yohan Perera)

Perks to MPs, but people suffer: JVP
	
The Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) today charged that the government was offering perks and privileges to MPs to secure its power while suppressing the people.
JVP MP Vijitha Herath said it was unreasonable to offer perks and privileges to MPs when people who fought for their rights were attacked with teargas and water cannon.
?Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe claimed that the MPs had difficulty in meeting expenses and approved the increase of their allowances while providing them with vehicles. Doesn?t he see that the people are struggling to face the soaring cost of living?,? he asked.
Mr. Herath said the government had approved Rs. 30 million for the renovation of the residence given to former president Mahinda Rajapaksa at Wijerama Mawatha in Colombo and another Rs. 20 million had also been approved to construct a new building.? (Ajith Siriwardana)

SC orders Mervyn to pay Rs.400,000
	
The Supreme Court ordered former Deputy Minister of Highways and Road Development Mervyn Silva to pay Rs.400,000 personally as compensation to the Petitioner for the demolition and destruction of a parapet wall, two toilets and a wash room in Kiribathgoda that belonged to the Petitioner.
Justice Anil Gooneratne, with Justices Eva Wanasundera and K. T. Chitrasiri concurring, observed in his judgment that the law did not permit any kind of manipulation by the 7th Respondent Mervyn Silva to cause harm to citizens or interfere with their basic rights.
Justice Gooneratne also observed that a court of law cannot be immune to or ignorant of happenings around the country that affect human lives and cause tremendous loss or injury to persons, including the loss of property.
He further observed that if an illegal act or wrong was done to a citizen and he sought legal remedy, the court needed to engage itself in an all-inclusive inquiry to obtain circumstantial and direct evidence and try the case according to the law.
The fundamental rights jurisdiction vested in the Apex Court was wide enough to reach a genuine complaint of a citizen who had suffered as a result of executive or administrative action, he noted.
That was the reason the court, even in the past, permitted litigants to submit their grievances even by post or post cards, and permitted applications to be entertained beyond the period ordinarily permitted by basic law, he added.
The Supreme Court also ordered the then Chief Inspector of Police of Kiribathgoda and the State to pay Rs.50,000 and Rs.100,000 respectively to the Petitioner as compensation.
Court also directed the Inspector General of Police to conduct investigations and ascertain whether any other persons were responsible for the destruction of the petitioner?s property, and whether instruments and machinery belonging to the State had been utilised by them to cause the destruction, and to take appropriate action after consulting the Attorney General.
Petitioner Asitha Nanayakkara Liyanage cited Chairman Prasanna Ranaweera and Secretary Hemapala Hettiarachchi of the Kelaniya Pradeshiya Sabha, the Commissioner of Local Government (Gampaha), the then Chief Inspector of Police, Kiribathgoda, Mervyn Silva, the Attorney General and two others as Respondents.
Vishva Gunaratne, with Sandeepani Wijesooriya, appeared for the Petitioner. D. M. G.Dissanayake, with Ms L. M. C. D. Bandara, appeared for Mervyn Silva.
Petitioner complained against the Respondents for harassment and abuse of him and his family, which ultimately resulted in the demolition and destruction of part of the house in which he resided and which belonged to him. (S.S.Selvanayagam)

The solar plant, built in an impressive eight months and funded by the Adani Group, is cleaned every day by a robotic system, charged by its own solar panels.The plant was built in 8 months and is cleaned everyday by a robotic system.
It also bears the capacity of charging its own solar panels. Furthermore, when in full swing, the plant is capable of producing electricity for 150,000 homes. The cost of this project was $$679 millions.
With this, India's total installed capacity of solar plants has nudged across the 10 GW mark. Thus, India will be the world's third-biggest solar market from next year onwards, after China and the US.
By 2022, India aims to power 60 million homes by the sun. It is part of the government's goal to produce 40 percent of its power from non-fossil fuels by 2030. The project basically aims at providing power to millions of houses in the nation, along with reducing air pollution.

Today is World AIDS Day
	
?
By Sarah Muiz ??
As we mark World AIDS Day today, let?s take a moment to reflect upon the various health implications concerning the subject of HIV/AIDS. As a disease that could deteriorate and ruin people?s health, the need to raise ample awareness on HIV/AIDs appears to be the need of the hour. Therefore, reinforcing the message that ?Prevention is better than cure? is crucial against contracting the disease. Speaking to Daily Mirror, Director of National STD/AIDS Control Programme, Sri Lanka, Dr. Sisira Liyanage explicated how HIV/AIDS could ruin the health of an individual while giving a deep insight into how the disease could attack the immune system of a healthy individual. Current statistics at the National STD/AIDS Control Programme indicate that people living with HIV in 2015 was estimated at 4100 with the prevalence rate for HIV in the 15-49 age group being less than 0.1% at the end of 2014. ?
?
Definition of HIV/AIDS ??
?
According to Dr. Liyanage, the HIV virus enters the body and attacks the white blood cells known as Lymphocytes, thereby destroying the human immune system. ?The virus enters the Lymphocytes known as CD4 cells and multiplies within these cells, while effecting other similar cells in the body. When the multiplication indicates an abnormal increase, the CD4 cell count will gradually decrease. When the number of CD4 cells in a patient falls below 200 cells per cubic millimeter of blood (200 cells /mm3), the patient will be considered to have progressed towards AIDS. When CD4 cells are destroyed, it can provide support for an effective immune system? he said. ?
?
Modes of transmitting HIV/AIDS ?
?
?There are three modes of HIV/AIDS transmission. He pointed out that the first method of transmission could take place during unsafe sexual intercourse. ?This is very unsafe due to the concentration of the HIV virus in the body of the infected person. Secondly, a person can contract the disease when sharing infected needles and blood transfusions. Many people nowadays tend to inject heroin into their veins and if such people share the same needles, the disease can be transmitted from one person to another, especially when the infected needles are unsterilized. Thirdly, HIV/AIDS could be transmitted from mother to child during pregnancy or delivery. During pregnancy, if the mother is infected with HIV, the virus can be transmitted to the fetus through a placental transmission. The disease could be transmitted to the child through breast milk as well? Dr. Liyanage added. ??
However, he said that in Sri Lanka, the main mode of transmitting HIV/AIDS takes place through unsafe sex. 90% of the disease transmission takes place due to unsafe sex, while less than 1% is due to blood transmission using unsterilized needles and 4% of the disease transmission takes place from mother to child. He also added that there could be other health implications following the development of HIV to an advanced stage of AIDS. Due to the lack of a strong immune system, such patients would be vulnerable to other health complications such as pneumonia, certain types of cancer, tuberculosis, diarrhea and weight loss. ??
?
Symptoms and Diagnosis
?
? When a person contracts the HIV virus, he or she may develop the symptoms of viral fever during the first three to six weeks. On the other hand, such symptoms may not appear in some patients who have contracted the disease. ? ?As part of the diagnoses process, if an individual has had unsafe sex followed by a mild fever, it would be advisable for them to conduct a HIV test to verify their health condition. The only way to identify a patient is to conduct a HIV diagnosis test. If not, it would be difficult to identify such patients. Besides, it should also be noted that complications such as pneumonia and tuberculosis are indicative of the secondary symptoms related to AIDS. ??
HIV and AIDS cannot be totally eradicated from the body but can be controlled with treatment. Even at the late stage of developing AIDS, we can provide the patient with antiretroviral treatment for HIV; to control the disease and prevent it from worsening. Since the HIV virus links with the cells in our DNA, it is very difficult to cure the disease completely. However, through constant treatment it is always possible to reduce the multiplication of the HIV virus in CD4 cells. With the proper antiretroviral treatment taken under medical advice, an HIV patient has a chance of leading a normal life. ?The youth who represent the young adults in society are very much vulnerable to HIV/AIDS. In most cases, they lack awareness and don?t take necessary ?precautions he said. ??
?
Precautions against contracting the disease ?
Stating that the main mode of transmission in Sri Lanka is recognized as unsafe sex, Dr. Liyanage said it was important to reduce such risky behaviour. ??It is always advisable to have a single partner throughout life and to use a condom in order to minimize the risk of contracting HIV/AIDS. It is also very important to raise ample awareness while reducing the stigma and discrimination attached to it. If not, such patients will feel reluctant to seek medical advice and treatment from us? he added. ??
