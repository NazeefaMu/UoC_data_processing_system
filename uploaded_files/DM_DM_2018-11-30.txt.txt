Appoint two PSCs to recover coup losses: Bimal
	
JVP MP Bimal Ratnayake yesterday said two Parliament Select Committees (PSCs) should be appointed to recover the losses and damages caused to the country by the political coup.
He told Parliament that President Maithripala Sirisena was responsible for the political impasse and that he should apologize to the nation for his actions.
"The purported government is not accepted by the international community. Even the Rajapaksa-friendly countries such as Swaziland and the Maldives do not accept it. Only some pro-Rajapaksa media institutions support them. The PSCs should comprise of professionals in the legal fraternity and other respected disciplines in order to enlighten the people on the true situation. Information on the coup should be taught to students so that this would not be a bad precedent. The PSCs should not merely assess the losses to the economy and resources, but should also look into the damage caused to the image of the country. They should recover the losses from those involved in the coup," he said.(Ajith Siriwardana and Yohan Perera)

Astrological principles for judging Childlessness 5th House is a vital determinant
	
Asrto 70
Part 2

Assessment of Putrasthana or 5th Bhava to ascertain factors indicating the prospects of getting progeny, sex or traits of children or the number of children to be born, requires the interpretation of the position of Jupiter in relation to other planets in the Rashi and Bhava Charts as the first step.

Houses relevant to making judgment
Next in the order of importance comes the 5th House falling in the Charts based on the Chandra Lagna (Moon sign) and the Surya Lagna (Sun-sign).
Apart from the 5th House, the 1st House and the 9th House too play an important role in the assessment of the strength of the Putrasthana because the 1st House represents self, and the 9th House, the fortune.
Fortune represents happiness from children apart from other positive factors like high status, fame, authority and wealth. The 1st House and the 5th House represent the bond between the progenitor and the offspring.

Childlessness marks a break with paternal lineage
Childlessness signifies the break with the paternal lineage. It also signifies the extinction of the family or Kutumbha which the 2nd House represents. Progeny involves the 11th Labha Sthana, the 5th from the 7th Bhava.
The strengths of the Ascendant and the planets in the Saptamsa Chart specific to progeny too are relevant to assessing the Putrasthana.
Ketu is a planet opposed to worldly happiness which means happiness from children as well. His presence in the 5th House or with Jupiter or the lord of the 5th can cause childlessness.

Other factors
The mere affliction of Jupiter, the occupant of the 5th House or the lord of the 5th alone may not cause childlessness. Therefore, following detrimental factors too should be considered in determining whether one would be denied the blessing of having children.
Weak and afflicted 5th and 9th signs or Bhavas from Jupiter and the Sun devoid of benefic influence.
	Afflicted 2nd, 7th signs or Bhavas and their respective lords reckoned from the Jamma Lagna or the Chandra Lagna.
	The 5th lord from the Jamma Lagna, Chandra Lagna or from Jupiter is in conjunction with the lords of the evil Houses or Dusthanas withoutbenefic aspect.
	Deeply combust 5th lord and Jupiter associated with malefics or the 5th lord aspected by more than two malefics.
	The 5th -9th, 3rd -9th or the 1st -7th Rahu- Ketu axis and the 5th lord in conjunction with a malefic. Fall or detrimental Rahu and Ketu causemore harm.
	The birth on Ava jalawaka (Krishna Chaturdashi) or on Amawaka (Amavasya) under the asterism (Nakshatra) ruled by Ketu or Mercury while the Moon and Jupiter being weak
	Malefics in the 1st, 5th, 8th and the 12th signs from the Ascendant or the Moon.
Evil planets in the 5th House except when they are swakshetra or exalted, kill all children unless it is aspected by Jupiter or Venus. Mars will kill only the firstborn if he has the aspect of Jupiter or Venus.

Bridegroom to be forgot to mention a 'tiny' detail
	
An incident was reported where a village matchmaker (Kapu Mahaththaya) was embarrassed and inconvenienced due to the deceitful actions of a bridegroom who asked for his services.
The matchmaker brought a proposal to his employer who was a middle-aged man. He, along with the bridegroom to be had visited the home of the proposed bride. In turn the bride's side too were invited to visit the home of the bridegroom in order to satisfy themselves of their future son-in-law's suitability.
Later, a date was fixed for the wedding. However, the bridegroom suddenly decided that he needed to meet with the parents of the bride to be. He said that he had something important he wanted to share with them and went along with the matchmaker to see them. What he said to them on arrival made them see stars. He told them he was a divorcee but insisted that this will not affect the upcoming marriage to their daughter as the marriage had lasted only a day.
The brides parents were angry at the man's remarks. They accused the matchmaker of deceiving them along with the bridegroom to be. However, the matchmaker denied being part of the cover-up and assured them that he was as surprised as them about the conniving nature of his employer. He had begged their forgiveness and asked them not to publicise his name in this awful saga as it would damage the good reputation he had built up with his clients if this got out. (P.M.

Britain biggest loser in disorderly Brexit: ECBs Vice President
	

FRANKFURT REUTERS Nov 29 -The euro zone bank sector is prepared for a hard Brexit and the Bank of England is right to warn of a deep recession if Britain leaves the bloc without a deal, European Central Bank Vice President Luis de Guindos said on Thursday. 
The BoE said on Wednesday that the British economy could shrink by as much as 8 percent in about a year in case of a no-deal Brexit, adding to pressure on lawmakers to drop their opposition to the Brexit agreement that Prime Minister Theresa May struck. 
Yesterday we had these reports from the UK Treasury and the Bank of England that I think made the correct point, de Guindos told a news conference. 
The most important point made by yesterdays report is that in case of a disorderly Brexit, the UK economy would enter into a period of very, very big recession, GDP would drop in the area of 8 percent, he said.

Former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen to plead guilty to lying to Congress
	

Former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen will plead guilty to a federal charge of lying to Congress on Thursday, according to news reports.

He will admit that he misled federal lawmakers about his contacts with Russians during the 2016 campaign season. 
Cohen has already testified in a Manhattan courtroom that he made an illegal hush-money payment to Stormy Daniels, a pornographic actress who claims to have bedded Trump a decade ago, in coordination with, and at the direction of Trump.
The latest twist in his saga will come with an attached string of dozens of hours of of testimony that could be criminally damaging to the president.
Cohens new charge comes from Special Counsel Robert Mueller. His previous ones, bank and tax charges to which he has already pleaded guilty, were lodged by federal prosecutors in the Southern District of New York.
He is expected to be sentenced to between four and five years in prison in December for his first federal case. Its unclear if the new guilty plea will involve more jail time.
Cohen has publicly turned against President Trump since the FBI raided his home and offices in April.
Prosecutors deemed the $130,000 Stormy Daniels payment illegal because it was intended to help Trump avoid an embarrassing electoral loss to Hillary Clinton  and was therefore an in-kind political contribution far in excess of the limits of the law.

The occasions arise for the people in a predominantly agricultural area in the country to seek the services of a certain state body looking after the activity of a river-based development project.

Despite this State body coming under the purview of a very high political authority, who has vowed to eradicate bribery and corruption, the hoi polloi cannot obtain any service from the white-collar ones attached this State body without offering them a santhosham, they say.
Even the high political authority is said to be aware that the white-collar ones are a corrupt lot, who do not move a finger to help a poor peasant without their palm being oiled, he has turned a blind eye to the situation as they are his own appointees.

Antics of some active players in the Numbers Game that began with the advent of the October 26 regime have spawned numerous humorous stories that may regale those in the know of them for years to come, they say.

The latest such story making rounds in political circles these days tells how a purohita had to run a marathon to his waiting car to escape a beating from an angry colleague when he called at the latters residence to woo his support to make up the majority.
The two actors in this drama had been colleagues in the same party until the advent of the new regime, which had put them on the two sides of the fence.
The host who had flown into a rage on seeing the unwelcome guest had set upon him demanding, How dare you to come to my house! You !
The purohita who had taken to his heels had got into his car and sped away.
These two politicos share the same name though they do not share the same political views on the current political impasse, they say.

Know your status to end HIV/ AIDS by 2025
	

The estimated total number of infections remains static over the years
The HumanT - Lymphotropic Virus is very rare in Sri Lanka and it can lead to neurological disorders
The world is heading towards eliminating AIDS, and Sri Lanka has also fast tracked its responseto this

The Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and the Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome commonly known as AIDS are two conditions that people fear. From having no cure in the past, both HIV and AIDs could be controlled today, thanks to extensive research done on both conditions.
Contracted mainly as a result of unprotected sex, HIV/AIDS could also be contracted from unscreened blood transfusions and using used needles for drug intake or even when getting a tattoo. In view of World AIDS Day which falls tomorrow (December 1) the Health Capsule spoke to Dr. Iresh Jayaweera, from the World AIDS Day organising team of the National STD/AIDS Control Programme (NSCAP) who shed light on the importance of testing oneself for HIV, treatments and prevalence in Sri Lanka.

The crucial test
Know your status  the World AIDS Day theme for 2018 calls upon everybody to test themselves for HIV/AIDS. Many of those diagnosed with HIV have gotten it from their marital partner, Dr. Jayaweera said in his opening remarks. Anyone having unprotected sex can be at risk of getting HIV. But the risk is zero if it is a mutually monogamous relationship in which both partners are free of HIV. In Sri Lanka it is estimated that around 3500-4200 people are infected with HIV. But only 2/3rds of them know that they have HIV. Others are in the community. If they dont test and find out, it will lead to the AIDS stage which has a high mortality. It is important to find out ones HIV status by testing, since people with early HIV infections are asymptomatic and only a blood test can detect HIV. According to him, if all the people with HIV in Sri Lanka are diagnosed for treatment their Viral Load in blood will be undetectable after about 6/52 of treatment. In other words if there is an undetectable viral load, the risk of infecting someone is almost zero. This will help to prevent and control new infections. The world is heading towards eliminating AIDS, and Sri Lanka has also fast tracked its response to this. It is only possible if you diagnose 90% of people living with HIV (PLHIV).
Antiretroviral therapy (ART)
As per the guidelines laid by the World Health Organisation (WHO) Sri Lanka, treatment is recommended for all adults and adolescents with HIV immediately, regardless of their CD4+ cell count. Antiretrovirals (ARVs) are a group of drugs that inhibit different steps in the HIV replication process and the cornerstone of HIV/AIDS management. ARVs have been consistently proven to reduce death due to HIV/AIDS and to reduce the development of AIDS-defining conditions. It should be noted that treatment is lifelong.

Treatment literacy
The Health Capsule learned that most people who seek treatment for HIV come from Western Province. Unlike other conditions getting diagnosed with HIV involves a heavy dose of counseling and education to the patients, he further said. It is continued throughout the care spectrum. So PLHIV are well aware about the treatments available and their treatment regimens, their effectiveness and how to adhere to the treatment plan. We also inform the public that effective treatment is available free of charge.

Other types of STDs and symptoms
Herpes simplex Virus, Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C, Human Papilloma Virus and Human T-Lymphotropic Virus are several other sexually transmitted diseases, Dr. Jayaweera added. Hepatitis B and C virus infect the liver and they can lead to Jaundice when severe. These conditions can also lead to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma of the liver. Various treatment options are available. Hepatitis B can be easily prevented by vaccination. According to him, the human papilloma virus cause genital warts and cervical and penile cancers in addition to other complications and once infected it is difficult to eliminate from the body. On the other hand, the Human T-Lymphotropic Virus is very rare in Sri Lanka and they can lead to neuorological disorders. Out of these conditions it is possible to cure Hepatitis B and C with continuous treatments.
Prevalence of HIV/AIDSin Sri Lanka
From the graphs given (Annual Report 2017), it is quite evident that the cumulative number of PLHIV by province of residence in the Western province is higher when compared to other provinces. Out of that 670 people are receiving ART in Colombo alone.

Awareness on safe sex methods
We are proud to say that spreading awareness on safe sex methods has been a success, he further said. We have been doing it with the Family Planning Association which is our main stakeholder and its success is evident with Sri Lanka still being a low prevalence country for HIV, in which less than 2 out of 10,000 people have HIV. The estimated total number of infections remains static over the years. A recent bio-behavioral survey done by the Ministry of Health showed high levels of condom use even among high risk populations such as commercial sex workers and men who have sex with men. About 10% of newly diagnosed HIV patients belonged to youth age group who are school leavers. It is difficult to introduce education about barrier methods to youth due to various societal factors.

Confidentiality of patients
It is a known fact that contracting HIV is associated with much stigma. This stigma keeps many of those with HIV away from seeking treatment. Stigma and discrimination prevails due to lack of knowledge among people. Therefore it is important to support PLHIV so that they could lead a normal life. Another one of their concerns include confidentiality. The National STD/AIDS Control Programme (NSCAP) had been providing care for sexually transmitted diseases since 1950s and there is a well-established system to ensure the confidentiality of our patients, Dr. Jayaweera continued. Even for the healthcare workers the information will be available on a need-to-know basis for the further care of patients. The staff enrolled is trained at the enrollment as well as refresher training programmes to tackle confidentiality issues, stigma and discrimination. Patient identification is not mandatory to seek treatment. In addition to that, there is a number system instead of using their names. Only the caring physician and his or her team have access to information.
About NSCAP
The National STD/AIDS Control Programme (NSACP) of the Ministry of Health, Sri Lanka is the focal point for the prevention and control of sexually transmitted infections (STI) including HIV. It is a specialized public health programme under the Deputy Director General (Public Health services) of the Ministry of Health. Under the NSACP there are 33 full time STD clinics and 23 branch STD clinics around the country. Of these STD clinics, 21 have the capacity to provide treatments for HIV free-of-charge for people living with HIV. Other than the curative care provided by the clinics, following activities are carried out;

Prevention of transmission of HIV among high risk population including commercial sex workers, men having sex with men, beach boys and drug users .
	Scaling up of HIV testing services among general population.
	Prevention of mother to child transmission (PMTCT) of Syphilis and HIV.
	Information, Education and Communication on HIV and sexually transmitting diseases.
It is important to address the stigma and discrimination related to HIV/STIs which will promote people reaching HIV/STI services and testing including those harder to reach, Dr. Jayaweera said in his concluding remarks. Our main goal of Ending AIDS by 2025 may not be accomplished if the general population is not sensitised on the HIV/STI epidemic in Sri Lanka. Therefore media support with current updates on the available services and care provided by NSACP has become timely and imperative for preventing this epidemic from progression in Sri Lanka.

During his testimony, Mr. Dahanayake informed the commission that Mihin Lanka had requested the aforementioned loan amount to acquire an aircraft on wet-lease.
When Deputy Solicitor General Milinda Pathirana questioned about the loan repayment, the witness divulged that the Treasury had transferred, as the first installment, a sum of Rs.200 million to the AASL account maintained at Bank of Ceylon (BOC) and the outstanding amount settled off by dividends of AASL.
He also informed the commission that Mihin Lanka had initially requested for a loan of Rs.1,085 million, however agreed for only Rs.500 million on the advice of the AASL Board of Directors. (Yoshitha Perera)

Mr. President, be a statesman even at this late hour!
	
Ousted Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe (right) is seen sharing a lighter moment with Opposition TNA leader R. Sampanthan on Tuesday in parliament. AFP

s Sri Lankas constitutional crisis deepens, whatever ways-out political analysts may propose, only a principled solution is desirable and should be called for. This is because the health of the countrys democracy depends on a rule-based order, where the doctrine of Separation of Powers is upheld, especially with regard to the independence of the judiciary.
No longer can we wait to rectify the distortion of democracy. The more we wait, the more damage is caused to democracy. Justice must prevail. A solution short of justice, in the name of a win-win compromise will be an affront to rule-based governance. Not only will the present generation suffer, but also generations to come, if we accept a compromise put forward in terms of the doctrine of necessity to solve the problem at hand while conveniently leaving the core issue  the constitutionality of the Presidents executive orders -- for another day.
Even if the political crisis drags on for weeks and months, even if the economic growth suffers and the administration grinds to a halt, justice must be the basis to
solve the crisis.

"But if Sirisena is to be remembered as a statesman, even at this late hour when he thinks he has reached a point of no return, he has to set aside power politics, listen to the growing civil society voice and restore the status-quo-ante"
In this constitutional crisis, the protagonists need to understand that for the sake of countrys wellbeing and that of the generations to come, what is required of them is a conduct befitting statesmen. The problem with many of Sri Lankas executive presidents, President Maithripala Sirisena included, is that they seldom keep the company of right-minded people who can give them advice based on moral values and principles upholding democracy and justice. Rather, their advisors, one of them being a once well-respected law professor, often become self-centred bootlickers and do not give a damn about democracy and rule of law. Instead, they massage the ego of the President, give warped interpretations to constitutional provisions and churn up loads of baloney.
Thus, it is not surprising, when the President, shorn of saner counsel, keeps saying he will not, under any circumstances, appoint Ranil Wickremesinghe as Prime Minister. One need not be a constitutional expert to discern the unconstitutionality of his statement. After all, the President is not so nave as not to know that appointing the countrys Prime Minister cannot be done in the same manner as appointing a maid to housekeep his private residence in Polonnaruwa.
Having allegedly acted arbitrarily, the President probably thinks he may end up with egg on his face if he, recognising that Mahinda Rajapaksa, the Prime Minister he appointed in a questionable manner, does not command a majority in Parliament, lets Wickremesinghe return to the premiership. But if Sirisena is to be remembered as a statesman, even at this late hour when he thinks he has reached a point of no return, he has to set aside power politics, listen to the growing civil society voice and restore the status-quo-ante.

"Even if the political crisis drags on for weeks and months, even if the economic growth suffers and the administration grinds to a halt, justice must be the basis to
solve the crisis"
As a way out of the crisis, especially in view of the damage being caused to the economy, some see a general election as a fair solution. Some suggest that Wickremesinghe should step down and allow another United National Party leader to become Prime Minister. They call them win-win solutions. Far from it, any solution is a travesty of justice if it does not allow Wickremesinghe to show his parliamentary majority once again and become the prime minster. As for Sirisenas conceited remark that he will not stay in office as president, if Wickremesinghe becomes Prime Minister again, all what he needs to do is to declare that he is ready to eat his words or sacrifice his self-respect for the greater cause of upholding democracy and ensuring stability. Such statesmanship is the need of the hour.
Apart from that, the solution that calls for any UNPer other than Wickremesinghe to be the prime minister is also loaded with moves to split the UNP. Whether Wickremesinghe should continue to run the party or he should retire from politics is totally an internal party issue and is not relevant to the legalities of the constitutional quagmire.
Meanwhile, some, in an expression of their frustration, call for a retirement age for politicians. If we had set the retirement age of 65 for elected representatives, we would not have fallen into this crisis, they say.
But there is no correlation between age and good governance. Nelson Mandela was 76, when he became South Africans President in 1994 and became an exemplary leader. In Malaysia, people placed their faith once again in 93-year-old Mahathir Mohamed at the general elections held in May this year and brought him from retirement to govern the country with a franchise to clean up the countrys corruption-ridden political system. Indias much-respected Prime Minister, Manmohan Singh was 72, when he first took office in 2004 and 82 when he left in 2014. The United States President Ronald Reagan was 77 when he ended his second term in 1989. These old leaders are not associated with constitutional coups or backdoor political manoeuvres. Yes, there are old leaders like Zimbabwes Robert Mugabe and Cameroons Paul Biya who abuse political authority and upend constitutional governance to remain in power until their people get sick and tired of them.

"Whether Wickremesinghe should continue to run the party or he should retire from politics is totally an internal party issue and is not relevant to the legalities of the constitutional quagmire"
Also young leaders are not necessarily good leaders. Hitler was in his forties when he triggered World War II and unleashed the Holocaust in which millions of Jews perished. Look at Saudi Arabia, where a young crown prince in his mid-thirties is making headlines for the wrong reasons, including the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. On the other hand, Canadas 46-year-old Justin Trudeau is a shining example of a young leader committed to good governance.
Old or young, age does not matter for leadership ability and commitment to uphold democracy, good governance and justice. Even if a countrys constitution is denounced as lacking in democratic features and promoting dictatorship, its head of state or government could still emerge as a good leader, if he is committed to uphold democracy and good governance. On the other hand, however good the countrys constitution is, a head of state or government can still be bad, if he acts arbitrarily. Such a leader would not hesitate to disregard a court ruling, even if it comes from the Supreme Court. In February this year in neighbouring Maldives, when the then President Abdulla Yameen did not like the Supreme Courts ruling ordering the release of political prisoners, he declared a state of emergency, got Supreme Court justices arrested and appointed new justices.

No change in Govt: SB
	
Minister S.B. Dissanayake said yesterday there would not be any change of government and Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa would continue in his post.
He told a news conference held at the parliament complex that the prime minister would not be replaced.
"There are no vacancies for a Prime Minister or ministers in the government. No other person will be appointed to that post. This government will continue," Mr. Dissanayake said.
He said the Speaker could not play around with a government appointed by the President and that they were awaiting the Supreme Court verdict on the dissolution of parliament.
Mr. Dissanayake said they would go for an election, if the SC ruling says so.
"We will be able to form a government at an election while the UNP will be reduced to 65 seats, Hakeem to three seats, Bathiudeen to two, the TNA to 13, TPA will lose its seats and Digambaram will win one seat," he said. (Ajith Siriwardana and Yohan Perera)

Pickled Constitution and achcharu Parliament
	

In an open market economy, there are no Bad boys or good guys

No democratic and decent rule can be expected from a government that has lost its credibility within an illegitimate Parliament. We are well aware, there can be no disciplined and clean Parliaments elected in these awfully corrupt open market economies. It is for that reason we stress the necessity of a National Development Programme as an alternative to this open market economy. Yet, the most immediate crisis today is that those who clamour for justice within this Parliament is further escalating and aggravating the crisis.
Quote from media statement issued Monday 26/11 by the Free Trade Zones and General Services Employees Union (FTZ&GSEU).
It is a chaotic crisis now, with Parliament turned into a playground for lumpen politicians. A resolution in Parliament proposes to stop funds allocated to the illegal PM, that may cut funds to Temple Trees where the sitting PM permanently resides.
No Confidence Motion against PM Rajapaksa, whilst labelling him illegal, challenged his majority twice leading to pandemonium in Parliament.
President Sirisena vows never again to appoint Wickremesinghe as PM. During the 2015 August elections, he vowed Rajapaksa would never be appointed PM even if he sweeps the polls.
Wickremesinghe was ousted for heavy corruption beginning with the first Bond scam says President Sirisena, promising to initiate investigations. A promise was given during the 2015 January presidential election too, to investigate corruptions during Rajapaksa rule.
In this Democratic Socialist Republic, the Supreme Court is inundated with FR petitions by urban Democrats, pleading the SC to stop elections Gazetted for 05 January 2019.
In the Police Department, funded by public monies to maintain law and order, top officers languish in jail for a contract killing and in remand prison as suspects for murder and abductions.
The IGP is questioned over a conspiracy to assassinate the incumbent President and former Secretary to the Defence Ministry and about a cheque drawn to the value of Rs. 500,000 where a DIG too stands implicated.
Present Chief of Defence Staff is also accused of aiding and abetting to protect a suspect in the abduction and murder of 11 Tamil youths.
The economy meanwhile came tumbling down and is about to break its crown at 200 Rupees for a US dollar even before Santa comes to town.
Everything happening, in the over three years of fiscal and economic (mis)management, under PM Wickremesinghe as Minister of Policy Planning and Economic Development, who had the Central Bank also under him. His closest political buddies handled everything from FDIs, FTAs to banking and finance in macroeconomic planning. Approval and implementation were co-ordinated by his experts appointed to an economic management committee that centralised everything under him. The lowest GDP growth rate in a decade was recorded in 2017 at 3.7 per cent under such economic planning.
This enormously corrupt open market economy necessitated a high handed and a miserably drafted, much hyped 19 Amendment that made the Constitution a Pickle of Contradictions for politicians to play rugby without a referee.
It led to the post 26/10 battle between the 02 major power blocs, to gain political access to an in the decent open market that provides numerous income sources with political power.
This battle, therefore, is not about opposing political ideologies and differences in development planning. No political party elected to Government since 1977 nor a single President from Jayewardene to Sirisena has ever talked about dumping this open market economy for a more inclusive and democratic development model.
The open market economy continues unabated with continued liberalisation in trade, massive tax and duty concessions for FDIs in export manufacture, foreign aid and loans borrowed for even unsolicited infrastructure projects.
To use the textbook term, neoliberal economies breed lumpen businessmen, famously called the Filthy Rich.
They take care of an urban middle-class for mutual gain and virtually buy political parties as a future investment.
The present mess, therefore, is not about bad boys posted to important positions, or about good guys not given important positions. It is about any guy posted to any position having got to survive in this filthy rich open economy, I always stress as inherently corrupt. In this inherently corrupt economy, all governments plan for private sector profits. IMF, WB and ADB strategy of effecting structural changes to ease out areas owned or controlled by the State thus become government policy. They not only provide new space for private investments but also allow private business to control social and personal life. That comes with the State pulled back from maintaining welfare services like health, education and public transport. With State enterprises declared bankrupt and sold-with relocation of people to release lands as real estate for private investment.

	"The unspoken irony is that 40 years of the open market economy has denied rural society a viable and a decent life irrespective of ethnic and religious differences"
	
	
	"There are no Good guys and Bad boys in open market economies"
	
This policy is carried through with the filthy rich engaging in decision making, supported by professionals brought in as consultants, advisers, experts and also as accountants and financial managers.
Deciding and drafting policies and reforms for investor freedom are outsourced to foreign agencies. They often get implemented with little information on the public domain. They are never democratic decisions and are not accountable to people.
In 2016 November the USAID launched such a dubious project effective till October 2020 titled Supporting Accelerated Investment in Sri Lanka (SAIL). It is subcontracted to a US company Chemonics International, Inc. mandated to-
Assist policymakers in relevant government ministries and agencies to formulate reform policies, draft legislation and regulations as needed, and build capacity for administrative implementation once reforms are approved.
The lingo says it all. It is once reforms are approved and not if approved.
When the USAID submitted draft labour laws in 2017, it was not to the Labour Ministry, but to the Ministry of Development Strategies and International Trade then under Malik Samarawickrama.
These draft laws will have to be adopted and the SAIL project is therefore mandated to create a lobby in legitimising their reforms.
It says:
Catalyze advocacy for reforms among civil society by working with industry associations, trade unions (sic) and other civil society organizations
Interestingly, the civil society will be their funded Colombo NGOs and trade unions would be those few, the Colombo office of the American Centre for International Labour Solidarity (ACILS) works with. In similar fashion, drafting reforms to restructure EPF was decided elsewhere and outsourced to the ADB to be within the 300 million US dollar ADB loan. The ADB then hired a US-based company for the job and their consultancy fee is borne by the SL Government as part of the ADB loan.
The Group has proposed private fund managers to decide EPF investments among many other reforms. These foreign projects provide for well looked after training here and abroad, foreign trips, local consultancies for State officials and middle-class professionals to fall in line with their thinking and defend the open market economic policy. All economic indices used in open market economies have no relation to peoples lives. The poverty line in Sri Lanka as in India, Bangladesh and in most other countries is only about meeting basic needs in poor lives without proper access to resources and opportunities. In October (2018) the national poverty line was accordingly decided at Rs.4,648 per person, per month. Would one ever believe a family of four could survive a month with both parents together eking out an income of Rs. 9,296 only
On that unbelievably and unrealistically low poverty line, it is said poverty had dropped to 4.9 per cent in Sri Lanka. Common sense tells one, if the poverty line is drawn at a liveable income of Rs.10,000 (USD 55) per person a month, poverty in Sri Lanka would immediately jump to over 60 per cent. So is it with annual GDP per capita income that has increased from USD 2,341 in 2008 to USD 3,842.3 in 2017.
In terms of the rupee to dollar exchange value as at 2017 December, it was Rs. 580,187.3 per annum at an average of Rs.48,349 per month. What percentage of the population can claim that monthly income in Sri Lanka
While the minimum monthly national wage is Rs.13,500, the average take-home pay announced for vacancies in the apparel sector is around Rs. 25,000 per month with incentives, target and holiday pay allowances and compulsory overtime, all totalled together.
Whats apparent therefore is, accumulation of wealth and income is in the city. It provides for the new rich and the urban middle class. The larger rural sector remains as cheap labour. Youth trek to main cities in search of employment in the expanding informal sector, where income and employment are never permanent. Most others, mostly young rural women end up as housemaids in the Middle East, remitting foreign income for an ailing economy.
The unspoken irony is that 40 years of an open market economy has denied rural society a viable and a decent life irrespective of ethnic and religious differences.
Apart from mega corruption, the urban middle class, also irrespective of ethnic and religious differences, reflects the open market economys growing inequality and injustice with the filthy rich dominating politics. With no ethnic and religious differences, politics is being vulgarised and is inevitable and unavoidable. Open market economies are effectively and functionally autocratic. The 19th Amendment proves the UNP leadership usurped power with a Pickled Constitution, while Rajapaksa abused power on Sinhala Buddhist dominance. There are no Good guys and Bad boys in open market economies. Demanding sanity without questioning the open market economy is an articulation of the urban middle class of their need for a privileged life with the status quo.
A permanent stable answer, therefore, is about dumping the open market economy and working out an alternate inclusive national development model with functional direct democracy for execution.
A hard job, but worth doing.

PM says waiting on SC ruling to move forward
	
Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa, in an interview with the Daily Mirror, said that he would await the Supreme Court ruling to decide on the next course of action to be taken.
Mr. Rajapaksa said the government had been able to contain underworld criminal activities after he assumed office.
During the previous rule, we saw underworld killings. On a daily basis, four to five persons got killed. The situation has changed now. Actually, things have changed for the better in the country in some aspects, he said.
He also said, There is no instability in the country as I can see. There is a certain dispute involving Parliament. That is all. It has not affected the country as a whole. People get on with their normal work. Public servants report to work. I travel all across the country. That is what I see. Likewise, we have meetings and demonstrations throughout the country, (Kelum Bandara)

Praying for an end to fathers woes!
	

A well-known daughter of a very high political authority had quietly visited a prominent kovil off the pearl-city at dawn the other day to offer a pooja.

The lady who had called at the kovil with a three-man- security escort had made a vow and prayed for divine intervention to relieve him of all malefic influences responsible for his current bad patch, they say.
A group in khaki uniform had rushed to the kovil on hearing that the family member of the VVIP had called over there, but they had found on arrival the lady had already left the place.
Soon after her departure, a group of political activists who arrived at the kovil had performed a coconut breaking ritual praying for an early riddance of the new regime, they say.

Quo warranto writ against MR, Cabinet: Further hearing on Dec 3.
	
During the hearing on the Quo Warranto Writ Petition against holding of the posts of Prime Minister and other ministers by former President Mahinda Rajapaksa and MPs supporting him, Senior Counsel Gamini Marapana PC yesterday contended that the Court of Appeal could not grant interim relief prayed by the Petitioners as the matter is pending in the Supreme Court.
The Bench comprising Justices P.Padman Surasena (President/CA) and Arjuna Obeysekera yesterday took up the petition of Writ of Quo Warranto disputing the holding of office by Prime Minster Mahinda Rajapaksa and 48 Ministers.
Gamini Marapana PC with Navin Marapana appearing for Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa submitted that the Supreme Court had already issued an Interim Order proclamation on the dissolution of Parliament.
He stated the Supreme Court had issued the interim Order operative till December 7 and fixed the matter for hearing on December 4, 5 and 6 and that the Interim Order was a temporary one staying the operation of the proclamation of dissolving the Parliament by the President.
If this court grants the Interim Order as prayed by the Petitioners and the Supreme Court vacate interim order, there would be a complex problem, he argued.
K.Kanag Iswaran PC with Suren Fernando appeared for the Petitioners.
Romesh de Silva PC, Manohara de Silva PC, Sanjeeva Jayawardena PC, Ali Sabry PC, Kushan Alwis PC appeared for the Ministers.
The Petition for Writ of Quo Warranto (a writ or legal action requiring a person to show by what warrant an office or franchise is held, claimed, or exercised) was filed by Purported Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and his purported Ministers as well as Parliamentarians of diverse parties totaling 122 petitioners.
Petitioners seek a mandate from the Court requiring the Respondents to show by what authority they claim to function as Prime Minister and/or Ministers and/or Deputy Ministers.
They also the Court for a declaration that the Respondents are not entitled to hold the office of Prime Ministers and Ministers or Deputy Ministers.
They are asking the Court to restrict the Respondents from functioning as Prime Minister, Ministers and Deputy Ministers until the final determination and hearing of their application.
Petitioners in their petition state as follows:
On 14th November 2018, Parliament passed a vote of no-confidence against the purported government of the Respondents.
On 15th November 2018, Parliament convened again and the Speaker stated the in view of the no-confidence vote passed on 14th November 2018, there was, among other things, no government and that he did not recognize Mahinda Rajapaksa as the Prime Minister.
On 16th November 2018, because the Respondents purportedly continued to function in office, Parliament passed another vote of no-confidence against the government.
Therefore under and in terms of Article 48 of the Constitution, the Cabinet stood dissolved from 14th November 2018 Petitioners claims.
They dismay that His Excellency the President notwithstanding the dissolution of Cabinet continues to lawfully be in charge of Ministries of Defence and of Mahawali Development and Environment.
They complain that the in view of the fact that the purported Ministers are unlawful, illegitimate and purported to exercise government power in direct violation of express provision of the Constitution.
They caution that a state of anarchy and chaos would ensue in the country given that the purported Government ha lost two votes of no-confidence and does no command a majority in Parliament. (S.S.Selvanayagam)

Responding to a journalist who asked Mr. Premadasa why he declined it, he said One might have personal aspirations of becoming leaders but things should be done in accordance with the law of the country. I am the Deputy Leader of the UNP and I am bound to work in accordance with the decisions made by my party."
Earlier, Mr. Premadasa hailed comments made by Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe and MP Ven. Athureliye Rathana Thera that those who command a majority in Parliament should be allowed to form a government as fair remarks.
Mr. Premadasa expressed this sentiment during a media briefing held at parliamentary complex last morning.
At the same time Mr. Premadsa said there was no provision to form a caretaker government under the constitution. He was referring to the request made by Ven. Rathana Thera to form a multi party caretaker government and go for a general election. (Yohan Perera and Ajith Siriwardana)

SLBC violated agreement on live coverage: Speaker
	
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya said today the Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation (SLBC) had violated the agreement on live coverage of the past few parliamentary sessions and vowed he would take immediate action against its Chairman.
He said Parliament had paid the SLBC for broadcasting live coverage of parliamentary sessions and that it was doing so for about four years now.
"I heard that SLBC Chairman was acting in a biased manner. I raised this matter with him twice," the Speaker said and added that the chairman's actions was a disgrace to Parliament.
He said this in response to a question asked by UNP MP Mayantha Dissanayake that the SLBC and Rupavahini Cooperation were acting in a biased manner and refrained from providing live coverage of parliamentary sessions.
The Speaker said Parliament had no agreement with the Rupavahini Cooperation with regard to live coverage. (Ajith Siriwardana and Yohan Perera)

## Title: Taking a close look at Warfarin  Therapy and PT/INR

Taking a close look at Warfarin  Therapy and PT/INR
	

A concerned daughter brings her father to a hospital as her father noticed blood in his stools. He also had large bleeding patches on the back of the chest and thighs. She recalls that her father is on Warfarin. Knowing that, the attending clinician quickly requests urgent PT/INR (together with some other tests) and admits him to the emergency care unit. His INR is 14. He is immediately managed as over-warfarinization. What is the cause of his symptoms Was he given an incorrect dose, questions the daughter.
With many adults getting clots related diseases, warfarin has become a common therapeutic agent among such patients. Warfarin, though it is a lifesaving drug, requires certain precautions and regular adjustment of dose in order to get maximum benefit and to prevent side effects of the drug. In todays Health Capsule, we are discussing the specifics of warfarin therapy and the test called PT/INR, with Dr K.A.C. Wickramaratne, Consultant Haematologist, Senior Lecturer in Pathology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Ruhuna. Following are the answers he gave to some of the frequent questions asked regarding the usage of the drug.

Q What is warfarin and when is it prescribed
Warfarin is a drug used to control blood clotting. It makes blood thinner or makes blood unable to form clots inside the vessels. Therefore, warfarin is prescribed in patients who have had or who is having high risk of blood clot formation like in the case of heart attack, brain attack, defects in heart valves or defects in heart rhythm etc.

Q What is the action of warfarin
It acts on some important clotting factors produced in the liver and makes them less active. That effect is through the inhibition of the action of vitamin K on these coagulation factors. Without the action of vitamin K, clotting factors cannot function normally. Therefore, blood clotting is impaired. By using warfarin appropriately, the clotting mechanism can be controlled at safe levels. Due to the same reason, if warfarin action is beyond the expected level, it can lead to bleeding. Also its important to remember that action of this drug can be interfered by drugs and food.

Q How does the doctor decide on the dose of Warfarin suitable for an individual
While many medications; paracetamol for example, can be prescribed using simple and fixed dose algorithms such as 500 mg, 250mg or 5mL etc as per the age and weight two - three times a day, Warfarin is different. It should be taken once a day, at the same time of the day; preferably in the evening  at 5 or 6 p.m. Warfarin is also prescribed in milligrams. However, there is no fixed dosage regime which suits all patients, since dosage of warfarin needed vary from one patient to another.
The dose of warfarin is determined based on International Normalized Ratio (or INR) which is calculated by prothrombin time (PT). Therefore this test is requested as PT/INR. INR is the internationally standardised measure to monitor warfarin therapy. INR is approximately 1 in a healthy adult. In a patient taking warfarin, warfarin dose which maintains INR between 2 to 3, is the appropriate dose to have its maximum effects. Any dose giving INR below 2 is an ineffective dose while any dose giving INR value above 3 is over active dose.

Q What interferes with warfarin action
Some medications can interfere with the action of warfarin. Therefore, when you are receiving treatment from a clinician, it is important to mention that you are on warfarin.

By using warfarin appropriately, the clotting mechanism can be controlled at safe levels

Q Do we need to restrict diet when we take warfarin
Many food items can interfere with the action of warfarin, especially any food rich in Vitamin K is crucial since Vitamin K counters the action of warfarin. But as long as your diet is regular with no major changes very frequently, there is no cause for worry. 
If a lot of green vegetables, oily foods, soya etc are consumed, that can affect the action of warfarin. However, it is not necessary to completely stop eating these items. Patients should adhere to a routine daily diet with regular vegetables and curries. Prominent variation from meal to meal and day to day, is not advised in an individual who is on warfarin. Occasional variation of diet on an occasion like a wedding or a party is not a major problem.


Q What else can affect warfarin action
Liver disease and alcohol consumption affects action of warfarin and increases the risk of bleeding.

Q How is warfarin therapy monitored
When warfarin is started for the first time, a PT/INR is performed after three days to evaluate INR. Based on the INR value whether it is above 3, below 2 or between 2 & 3, haematologists adjust the dose. The INR is evaluated repeatedly for effectiveness of dose adjustments until it reaches the dose of warfarin which gives INR between 2 and 3. Thereafter, INR is monitored monthly as long as warfarin therapy is continued. Depending on the disease condition, warfarin is prescribed either for a shorter period such as three months or, in some instances, for life.

Q What is the sample needed for PT/INR test
the sample is rejected by the laboratory, we need a fresh sample there were clots in the sample there was haemolysis in the sample . You may be familiar with these responses from laboratories.
In these cases you might have wondered why the test can be done on the sample collected, or if more than one sample was collected, why the test cannot be performed using blood from another sample. The answer to these questions is that if the sample is not suitable, overfilled or under filled or partially clotted or haemolysed, that sample is not suitable for PT/INR. It should be venous blood collected through a neat venipuncture, preferably without applying a tourniquet, filled in to a special citrated tube, with no clots or haemolysis.

Q What are the major risks of warfarin therapy
If INR is not monitored and dose of warfarin is higher than optimal, the patient can bleed and that can be serious enough to cause death in some instances. If it is too low, patient can develop clot formation since the drug dose is not adequate to be effective. Long-term warfarin therapy also can adversely affect bone calcification.

Q Are there other uses of PT/INR
No, PT is a useful coagulation test in many different conditions. That includes liver disease, bleeding disorders, assessment of bleeding risk prior to surgery etc.

Q How quality of PT/INR results are verified in laboratories
Laboratories should run and monitor quality control samples. If fully automated machines are not used, few trained, dedicated technicians or MLTs should be allocated for these tests.If the laboratory is accredited as per ISO 15189 or CAP accreditation scheme we can rely on their results to be reliable.

Q Any last message to the readers who are on warfarin therapy
By visiting haematology clinic monthly without fail, continuing medication as prescribed and following a regular diet with minimal variation, you can ensure the maximum effect of warfarin with minimal side effects allowing you to lead a healthier and a longer life.

The defenders of the indefensible
	

I am neither a supporter nor an opponent. There are more reasons than one to like the man and more reasons than one todislike him
Only the mob and the elite can be attracted by the momentum of totalitarianism itself. The masses have to be won by propaganda. (Hannah Arendt)
Speaking with Bandula Jayasekara aboard Pethikada, Gomin Dayasiri claimed that it is the people who were to blame for the debacle the Rajapaksas brought the country to. The reason, he argued, was that after Mahinda Rajapaksa oversaw the ending of the war, those who loved him turned him into a maharajano. Had the people been more careful in crowning the man who was, essentially, a politician voted in on a mandate to end the war, he would not have arrogated to himself powers that contravened the norms of legitimacy, custodianship, and governance.
Gomin has a point. A very good point. We elect those we prefer to lead the country and when those we elect achieve what we want them to, we crown them and hand them and their cohorts blank cheques. Mahinda had his moment and, depending on how you view it, he lost it. Happens. That is perhaps why even those who continue to bat for him and idealise a third term as president are not so willing now to celebrate the likes of his wife, his sons, and some of the more populist, demagogic sections of his party, i.e. firebrands like Udaya Gammanpila and Wimal Weerawansa.

That point, however, holds valid for politicians of all shades, and not just the populist, demagogic sort. It is valid for those who support the Rajapaksas and for those who are opposed to the Rajapaksas. I believe, therefore, that it is valid to the man at the centre of the anti-Rajapaksa cabal, the man you either celebrate or demonise. I am talking, of course, about Ranil Wickremesinghe.
Before everything else, however, a caveat: I am neither a supporter nor an opponent. There are more reasons than one to like the man and more reasons than one to dislike him, some owing to his character and others to factors beyond his character. What Im concerned about here is not Ranil Wickremesinghe the politician (of whom everyone has written everything), rather the people who propagandise him.
Mahinda Rajapaksa, then as now, solicits support from a broad section of the population who are essentially Sinhala or Buddhist, or allied to a more inclusive Sri Lankan identity that is, at the same time, rooted in the Sinhala Buddhist ethos. Im not saying that this is the absolute truth; rather, it is the impression that his promoters have built up over the decades. In any case, Mahinda has become the most definitive face of the SLFP since Sirimavo Bandaranaike, so much so that Im willing to wager most SLFPers continue to associate him with the firebrand Sinhala Buddhist nationalism that even Sirimavos own daughter tried to do away with it.
Ranil is different. He solicits support, then as now, from a narrower milieu, based on and rooted in Colombo (the city). It can be said that the milieu that elects a politician is the same milieu that spawns those who celebrate him or her in the public sphere, the media and the blogosphere included. Simply put, the milieus which support Ranil and Mahinda are the same milieus that give birth to their hagiographers.
The English media, which is reflective of the English readership, has not, to this day, produced a hagiographer for Mahinda Rajapaksa on par with the hagiographers of Ranil Wickremesinghe. At one level this is to be expected, since support for Mahinda stems from the popular Sinhala consciousness and it makes sense to pen down a piece celebrating him in a Sinhala newspaper. Support for Ranil, on the other hand, stems from those whom Gomin Dayasiri referred to as the Kolombians, i.e. those who are not only deficient in Sinhala and/or Tamil but also revel blissfully in this deficiency and are more insular, yet strangely more cosmopolitan, than the commentators who see everything good and nothing bad in Mahinda.
By those who bat for Ranil in the English press, I deliberately exclude the moderate columnists, that is, the likes of Sarath de Alwis, Tisaranee Gunasekara, Kishali Pinto Jayawardana, W. A. Wijewardena, and Ratnajeevan Hoole, all of whom, to be fair by them and those who read them enthusiastically (like me), are shaped less by political preferences than by an overriding concern for democracy, economic rationality, and good governance. These are not Ranil lovers by any stretch of the imagination, and if they do support the previous status quo, i.e. a Ranil premiership (which de Alwis once called, memorably and very accurately, a Royalist Regency), it is not because they believe the man to be the most able to stand for those norms and values.
There are, however, other columnists. They not only bat for Ranil, they muddle up their facts and let their prejudices (virulently anti-everything-outside-Colombo) get the better of them. They are shallow in the truest sense of that term, so while they celebrate the man they think is Ranil Wickremesinghe, attacking those who see his other side (a side which other neutral columnists have explored and laid bare for us frequently), they end up being as insular, if not more insular, than the writers who champion a Mahinda Rajapaksa premiership and, if possible, presidency.

"Mahinda Rajapaksa, then as now, solicits support from a broad section of the population who are essentially Sinhala or Buddhist, or allied to a more inclusive Sri Lankan identity"
The I-bat-for-Ranil club is, not surprisingly, more nauseating than the I-bat-for-Mahinda club, because in the popular consciousness, among the neutral floating vote base especially, the latter is seen for what it is: one-sided, driven by support for a man motivated by a blatant love of power, and reflective of the racism of a big majority of that mans electorate. In other words, Mahinda is the known devil. Because not many people belong to or affiliate themselves with the pro-Ranil writers club, on the other hand, not many come across, or take seriously, articles that praise Ranil for no reason other than the fact that he is the man they idealise him as. There is a reason why this brand of hagiography doesnt hold water, by the way: as columnists more experienced than I have proved, while Mahinda has a trump card (yudde iwara kara), Ranil has precious little to show as PRIME MINISTER, his achievements as Minister and Leader of the House being grist for an entirely different debate.
This is why most of those pieces about him make no sense, because, in the absence of an accomplishment he can take full credit for (at least in the popular view), the most typical reasons resorted to when celebrating him cohere into an elitist, self-centred, anti-everything-outside-Colombo worldview: that he is a gentleman; that he studied in such and such a school; that he is a good son, brother, husband, uncle, and employer (whose employer Ours) who may not carry babies and smile with the people but who care for the people more than those who can and do.
This is also why those from the English language media seen to be lackeys of Mahinda Rajapaksa surprisingly come out as more cosmopolitan, intellectual, and genuine IN COMPARISON TO many of those who bat for the anti-Rajapaksa, pro-Ranil side. Just the other day, for instance, I was reading through some articles written by these lackeys, i.e. the likes of Dayan Jayatilleka, and I couldnt help but notice that the arguments they made were more compelling, more thought-provoking, and more sensible than the tripe dished out by the I-bat-for-Ranil club.
To be sure, these articles do call for a Rajapaksa Restoration. But they do not call for that contingency because of a vaguely defined goodness and flawlessness in the mans character. They deify him (at times, nauseatingly), yet they do not celebrate his act of belonging to exclusivist clubs. They affirm what he did, not what he CAN do because he came from such and such a family and attended such and such a school. Rephrasing what Gomin Dayasiri said, then, we can say that it is those undying blue-and-gold-skinned boys and girls batting for Ranil who are to blame for the debacle that he and his party brought this country to. These are the same boys and girls who, salivating over Ranils perceived commitment to decorum and democracy, ironically rebuke those who criticise him by suggesting that they must give him a chance (even though we gave him more than 20 and he lost them all) In case youre wondering, folks, no, it doesnt get more self-contradictory than that.

The need of the hour: Guts to compromise in the name of the country
	

If Rajapaksa withdraws from the fray UNP will face a dilemma with President attempting to appoint anyone other than Ranil Wickremesinghe

Within ten years from 1989 to 1999-India saw eight regime changes of which only three had been effected through Lok Sabha (Parliament) elections. 
In all other instances, new governments assumed office due to the previous ones failed to prove their majority in the Lok Sabha. 
After a decade-long rule by the Gandhi family, Janatha Dal leader V.P. Singh came to power as Prime Minister in 1989 but his administration collapsed in 11 months for want of majority, when the BJP withdrew support, following a row over Babri Masjid issue. 
It paved the way for Samajwadi Party leader Chandrasekhar to become the Prime Minister, despite his party commanding the support of only 46 out of 545 members of the Parliament. 
When Rajiv Gandhi withdrew support to Chandrasekhar government after three months over an alleged spying incident near the formers residence, that government also fell. 
Since no party came forward to take the reins of the country the President ordered a fresh election in 1991during which Rajiv Gandhi was killed by the LTTE. Backed by Jayalalithaas AIADMK, P.V. Narasimha Rao of the Congress Party assumed office then and he was lucky to complete his five-year term. 
BJP leader Atal Bihari Vajpayee, who was sworn in as the next Premier after the 1996 general election was in office only 12 days as he was defeated at a confidence vote in the Lok Sabha. Before the 1998 election, another two governments of Prime Ministers H.D. Deve Gowda and Inder Kumar Gujral of United Front fell for want of majority in the House after the Congress Party withdrew support to them. The second government of Vajpayee which was voted in at the 1998 election also faced the same fate when J. Jayalalithaa pulled the carpet under his feet in April 1999. 
However, never during this period, a constitutional crisis, such as the one Sri Lanka is currently embroiled in, cropped up in India for the simple reason that the country put in practice a procedure where a confidence vote is taken after every regime change and every major crossover.
This is not only to test the ability of the new ruling party to run the government, rather test thereby the validity of the Presidents opinion that his nominee for the premiership commands the confidence of Parliament. 

"In a practical sense, Prime Minister Rajapaksa cannot ensure getting any Bill or motion carried in Parliament even if his group is the largest single group, without the support of 113 members"
The absence of such a procedure has landed Sri Lanka now in a constitutional mess as well as a political impasse. 
In fact, there is no Constitutional conundrum or a political deadlock hadnt there been manoeuvring by several leaders for their very political survival. Also, the shamelessness of politicians has also largely contributed to the current imbroglio. To put it in simple terms, both Mahinda Rajapaksa who was appointed Prime Minister on October 26 and Ranil Wickremesinghe who was ousted from the same post on the same day must be ashamed to lay claim to the premiership now without a working majority in the Parliament. 
In spite of President Sirisena and Rajapaksa loyalists having claimed earlier that Rajapaksa commanded the confidence of majority members of Parliament; the new ministers now claim that they are the largest single group in the House and that qualifies them to lay claim to the government. That too seems to be wrong.
After the regime change by President Maithripala Sirisena, nine MPs  seven from the United National Front (UNF) and one each from EPDP and TNA - joined hands with Rajapaksa.
Thus, the UNF strength came down from 106 (105 UNPers plus a solitary SLMC member) to 99 while the UPFA amassed 104 seats in the Parliament. 
Later, two of those crossed over to the UPFA returned to the UNFs fold and Manusha Nanayakkara also crossed over to the UNF. Hence, the new ratio between the UNF and the UPFA stands now at 102:101. They along with the Speaker, 15 remaining TNA members and 6 JVP members make up the 225 member House.
On the other hand, a working majority in Parliament is not a party or a group being the largest single group. It is not a matter of prestige, nor is it a matter of ritual; rather it is a matter of practicality. 
A ruling party must have a relatively consistent majority power to adopt Bills and motions it presents in the House. 
Otherwise, no party or group can run a government or at least a Pradeshiya Sabha. 
In a practical sense, Prime Minister Rajapaksa cannot ensure getting any Bill or motion carried in Parliament even if his group is the largest single group, without the support of 113 members.

	Mahinda Rajapaksa and Ranil Wickremesinghe must be ashamed to lay claim to the premiership
	
	
	A working majority in Parliament is not a matter of prestige, nor ritual; it is a matter of practicality 
	
	
	President says the way the motions were carried was legally acceptable but morally not. morality had no place in this issue
	
	
	The situation demands sanity and compromise on the part of the stakeholders
	
Already, two no-confidence motions against Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa and his Cabinet with 122 signatures have been passed in the Parliament after October 26, despite the legality of their passage being challenged by those supporting Rajapaksa. And another motion for the appointment of a Parliamentary Select Committee (PSC) has also been adopted with 121 members electronically voting, while the Rajapaksa loyalists had walked out. 
President Maithripala Sirisena in an interview with our sister paper The Sunday Times last week had not said that the way the two no-faith motions were passed was illegal. 
He says Standing Orders can be suspended and a vote can be taken by a voice count by the Speaker.Though there is a provision in the Standing Orders, a majority voice vote on a matter of changing the government, nationally important, is not suitable.If the Speaker had taken a vote by name than a voice vote, that would have been better 

"This is not only to test the ability of the new ruling party to run the government, rather test thereby the validity of the Presidents opinion that his nominee for the premiership commands the confidence of Parliament"
In other words, he says the way the motions were carried was legally acceptable but morally not. However, the whole world including the President was watching how the Mahinda loyalists prevented the Speaker from taking a roll-call of the names and was forced to take a voice vote. 
Besides, morality had no place in this whole issue. 
How could the President morally justify his appointment of Rajapaksa as the Prime Minister, when it was clear that the latter did not and still does not command the confidence of the Parliament 
What were the moral grounds that would justify both the prorogation and the dissolution of the Parliament, when it is also clear that it was the majority issue that prompted him to take those steps
It is true, that the Speaker at least on one occasion acted in favour of the UNP, his party when he said soon after the appointment of Rajapaksa as the Prime Minister that he would not accept that appointment. 
At a time when the UNP had not legally challenged the sacking of its leader, Ranil Wickremesinghe as the Prime Minister, Speaker has to accept the new appointment and put it to test in the House, as happens in India.
The Mahinda loyalists seem to boycott the Parliament till the Supreme Court ruling on December 7 against the Presidents November 9 decision to dissolve the Parliament, as they fear vote takings on any matter in the House. If the Supreme Court ruling went against the dissolution, Rajapaksa would have to face this situation till February 2020 when the Parliament completes four and a half years since its first meeting in August 2015, during which he would have to pass two budgets among others. Hence, the situation demands sanity and compromise on the part of the stakeholders.
In an unlikely withdrawal of Rajapaksa from the fray, it is the UNP that would face the harshest situation, as there is a possibility of the President attempting to appoint Sajith Premadasa or another from the UNP to the post of Prime Minister. That might bring in cracks in the UNP in the light of the Sajith factor already has made inroads into the rank and file of the party.

A coordinating secretary of a political bigwig who attended a recent party conference in Kandy had to make a dash for safety when a group of party activists set upon him the moment he made his appearance there.

The partys district high-ups were finalizing the arrangements regarding a planned massive protest when the coordinating secretary arrived there to attend the conference only to receive the unexpected hostile reception from the participants.
The party activists had been nursing a grudge against this secretary, an arrogant person, as he had made it a practice to prevent them from meeting the political bigwig by giving some excuse or other. And they had been waiting for a chance to teach the man a good lesson, they say.

Time to be concerned about our children - EDITORIAL
	
he security of children once they step outside their homes has become a matter of concern following the stabbing to death of a schoolboy in Matara, a few days ago.
An individual following the stories associated with schoolboy violence would observe that a good number of these incidents have taken place either on the way to tuition classes or when returning home after these study sessions.
The most recent incident which took place in Matara suggests that parents need to be concerned about where their children are going and what type of dangers they are exposed to.
Many years ago, during the times when kids had a life outside school and studies, parents were aware where their children were when they stepped outside their homes. These parents, during this era, had no reason to be concerned where their children went. This is because their offspring had that sense of awareness to stay clear of trouble. In other words children during that era knew how to get home in one piece even after experiencing the most challenging situations.
Now the times are different. Parents need to be concerned about their children. Awareness regarding the whereabouts of the kids wont suffice. Any psychologist would agree that choosing to be concerned over being aware makes the parents tired.
The Matara stabbing incident is in a way related to a female. This is an era where many parents who have daughters are extra cautious about where their children go. There have been many incidents where schoolgirls have been subject to physical abuse just because they turned down requests by boys who wished to start intimate affairs with them.
The Matara stabbing incident was recorded on a CCTV camera and aided the law enforcement officers to conduct speedy investigations. The assailant of this deceased, also a schoolboy from a leading school in the area, has been remanded till December 3.
The stabbing incident denied a mother and father a son and the nation and the school he was studying at a bright student. Such incidents question the upbringing of children in the present society because kids are hugely influenced by the violence they witness in the movies shown on television. Its time that the authorities censor gruesome violent scenes in the movies shown, like blackout scenes where there is the use of liquor and products made of tobacco.
An individual who is not yet a teenager can be vulnerable to an assault, even death. Three years ago an incident was reported in Matara where a 12-year-old died following an altercation at a musical show. In 2013 a 16-year-old student was stabbed to death when a group conducting a discussion to organise an alms giving got into a dispute. In 2015 a grade 10 student of Ambalangoda passed away after contesting a marathon.
We have also received reports of teenage students going berserk inside high-schools and using firearms to cause destruction. There was one such incident in August this year reported from South, London where a 15-year-old male student-having a record of drug offences associated with his name stabbed four individuals. Now when we compare reports from around the world regarding violence which features teenagers, the habit of using drugs also surfaces. But our focus on the editorial today is not on drugs being associated with teenage violence. What we stress is that parents should be more aware of where their children are going and what they have been up to once leaving their homes, early in the morning.
Most Sri Lankan families see both parents being employed. Such parents might not have the time to look into the affairs of their children. However they must know that they are not released from their responsibilities towards their children just because they are engaged in this vicious rat race which ensures their existence.
Busy parents must find quality time to spend with their children. Sometimes a few minutes with them in the night will make you aware that they are in vulnerable situations and you need to enhance their security.

Understanding Varicose Veins
	

Occasionally, the varicose veins can burst due the high pressure within. This is rare, but can be quite dramatic

Veins are responsible for returning blood from the legs back to the heart

If you can control weight and avoid being overweight, it definitely helps in minimizing the chance of recurrence

In this weeks Health capsule we take a close look at quite a common hazard among people which is Varicose Veins. Following are some of the most common questions which are asked regardingthis topic.
Q What areVaricose Veins
Varicose veins are a common disease affecting the veins of the legs. We have two types of blood vessels in the body. Arteries carry the blood from the heart to the other tissues including the legs. Veins are responsible for returning blood from the legs back to the heart. Therefore, this flow of blood in the veins has to take place against gravity. Nature has made sure that this process happens normally by giving us a set of valves inside the veins.
These valves make sure that the blood in the veins, go back up rather than falling down by gravity. However, in the disease called varicose veins, these valves become non-functional. This results in more and more blood being pulled down in to the legs and stagnating in the veins of the lower legs rather than being moved to the heart. When this happens over a long period of time, it results in pooling of blood and increase of pressure in these veins causing them to get larger, tortuous and ballooned out. This process is called varicose veins.

Q What causes this condition
The commonest reason for this is actually a genetic tendency (hereditary or familial). In fact approximately 30% of those suffering from varicose veins have someone in the family who has this condition and it tends to be hereditary.
In addition, being overweight also causes veins to weaken and results in varicose veins.
Pregnancy can be the cause for varicose veins due to the extra pressure on the leg veins due to the baby within as well as the effects of increased oestrogen levels during pregnancy. If you stand a lot during your daily routine, this also results in a higher tendency to develop varicose veins

Q Is varicose veins more common among females Is it related to the use of high heeled foot wear
Actually 60% of those who develop symptomatic varicose veins are females. However, males also develop this condition fairly commonly and account for 40% of those who have it. The use of high-heeled shoes actually has no definitively proven connection to the development of varicose veins.

Q Is there a connection between ageand this condition
Yes, the most common age group to develop this condition comprise those between the ages 40-50. However, especially in those who might have a family history of varicose veins, the condition can actually surface even around the age of 20 years or earlier.

Q What is varicose veins laser treatment
Laser treatment is one of the latest additions to the treatment armamentarium for varicose veins. Up until about 20 years ago, all we had was open surgery. Now we have laser and radio frequency methods. The advantages of these newer methods are numerous:
They are relatively painless or are associated with minimum pain compared to open surgery.
	They can be performed under local anesthetic on most occasions.
	They usually do not leave behind scars or wounds.
	The patients are able to walk almost immediately and are often able to return to their normal routine/ work, the very next day.

Q Can you develop varicose veins after laser treatment
Well, approximately 20-25% of varicose veins tend to return regardless of what treatment is administered. This is especially so in those who have a family history of varicose veins or those who are overweight. However, the great majority (approximately 75%) do not return. Even the ones who do return after appropriate laser treatment are often quite small in number and much easier to treat with simple methods like injections. Therefore it is always advisable to get the appropriate treatment at the correct time.

Q Can a person staywithout treatmentWhat are the risks
Well, most varicose veins do not give any symptoms at first apart from the cosmetic disfigurement. Actually the first symptoms of varicose veins are the heaviness and pain in the legs. This is especially so when standing for long periods. The patient would typically feel tiredness or pain in the legs after standing for a few hours or after a day of work towards the late afternoon or evening.
Thereafter, the skin over the ankle area gets discoloured and brown due to the stagnating dirty blood. The skin also starts to be itchy.
The next stage is that the resulting damaged skin breaks forming an ulcer or wound. At this stage the treatment is complicated. It often requires repeated bandaging for periods up to 6 months to heal. Once the ulcer is healed a definitive treatment is required in order to avoid the wounds from returning.Occasionally, the varicose veins can burst due to the high pressure within. This is rare, but can be quite dramatic. It can happen without any prior warning or pain, often happening when you least expect it. If it does happen, we advise the patient to apply a tight bandage or dressing over the area of bleeding and seek medical advise immediately.

Q What are the precautions to take after treatment
Once treatment is complete, a few simple things can sometimes reduce the chance of varicose veins from returning. If possible, one must limit the duration of time they are on their feet. However, this may not be practical depending on the occupation or household work that one does.Something that all of us can do is control body weight. If you can control weight and avoid being overweight, it definitely helps in minimizing the chance of recurrence.

US puts on hold discussions over SLs participation in MCC
	
The US has put on hold its discussions with Sri Lanka on its potential participation in an American aid initiative on poverty reduction due to the disruption in the country's democratic process following the ouster of Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, a senior official has said.
Sri Lanka plunged into a political crisis after President Maithripala Sirisena dismissed Wickremesinghe and replaced him with former strongman Mahinda Rajapaksa.
Rajapaksa has failed to muster the support of the majority in the Parliament.
"Because of this disruption to Sri Lanka's democratic process, we have put on hold discussions about Sri Lanka's potential participation in Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) programmes," the senior Trump administration official told PTI when asked about the relationship with Colombo and the Trump Administration.
The latest move by the Trump Administration could be seen as a setback for Sri Lanka, which was expecting a major investment from the US in the island nations transport and land sectors.
The proposed MCC Sri Lanka Compact was designed to spur economic growth and investment by the private sector to reduce poverty and increase economic opportunities for its people, according to MCC Chief Operating Officer Jonathan Nash who visited Sri Lanka in September this year for talks with Sri Lankan authorities.
The United States believes that the steps taken by President Sirisena were unconstitutional and wants the country to get back to its democratic process at the earliest.

The United States believes that the steps taken by President Sirisena were unconstitutional and wants the country to get back to its democratic process at the earliest.
Just before Sirisena dismissed the Wickremesinghe government, Sri Lanka and the US were in the final stage of the discussions. The MCC was to fund the compact entirely through grants which do not need to be repaid rather than loans.
Discussions on the MCC would now resume only after the constitutional crisis in Sri Lanka is restored through democratic means.
"We are concerned about the extra-constitutional steps that President Sirisena has taken," the senior administration official told PTI.
"The longer the situation continues, the greater the risk of ethnic turmoil and violence," warned the official.

We dont like to attend an illegal gathering: MR
	
Responding to a question as to why the government MPs had boycotted parliament sittings once again, Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa yesterday explained that they dont intend attending an illegal gathering.
We are not avoiding anything. We simply dont like to attend an illegal gathering, he told journalists in parliament, adding that parliament sessions were being held illegally and accused Speaker Karu Jayasuriya of not respecting the law. The Speaker doesnt respect the law. We decided not to attend because of his arbitrary actions, he said.
When asked how the crisis situation would be resolved if the situation continued in this manner, Mr. Rajapaksa said it would be resolved. We are awaiting, he said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)\

We will adopt next strategy after Supreme Court ruling MR
	

	If General Elections are ruled out, we would get 113 in Parliament
	
	
	Efforts underway to engage international community
	
	
	Most countries are with us
	
	
	We have no grudge against the western world
	
	
	Today, the JVP and the UNP speak in one voice
	
	
	There is no such thing called capturing power through the backdoor
	

ahinda Rajapaksa, former President and Prime Minister appointed by President Maithripala Sirisena on October 26, in an interview with the Daily Mirror, spoke about the current status of the country and the plans he wishes to carry out after the Supreme Court ruling on dissolution of Parliament, expected on December 7, 2018. Excerpts:


Q Now, the country is ungovernable. There is instability in the country. How do you intend to end this crisis
There is no instability in the country as I can see. There is a certain dispute involving Parliament only. That is all. It has not affected the country as a whole. People get on with their normal work. Public servants report to work. I travel all across the country. That is what I see. Likewise, we have meetings and demonstrations throughout the country.
During the previous rule, we saw underworld killings. On a daily basis, four to five persons got killed. The situation has changed now. Actually, things have changed for the better in the country in some aspects.
Q Now, there is a crisis involving Parliament. It has hampered decision making. Wont it affect the country in another month or two
Whatever it is, we have to wait for the ruling by the Supreme Court on December 7. The matter is pending before court. We will be able to talk about the countrys situation subject to the court ruling only. Until then, we cannot talk anything about it.
Q What are you planning to do
We will decide after the court ruling. We are in a win-win situation. We took over the Government. We always requested for elections. We agitated for elections. We do not mind even if we do not get an election. We have the support of 113 MPs. We will show it at the right time.
Q How certain are you that you have the support of 113 MPs in Parliament
In case, a General Election is ruled out, we will show it in Parliament and proceed.
Q Now, the JVP and the UNP say they are ready for any election, but not under your Government. They want your Government to be unseated as a condition for elections. What is your view
Today, the JVP and the UNP speak in one voice. JVP Leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake is the mouthpiece of UNP Leader Ranil Wickremesinghe. It is no wonder that both the parties have the same viewpoint.
Q There is perception among some that you took over the Government entering through the backdoor despite your ability to win elections in the future. What is your view
There is no such thing called capturing power through the backdoor. A political party is not meant to be in the opposition forever. It should try to become the ruling party on the very first occasion made available to it. We vowed to topple the Government after two Vesak Poyas. One Vesak Poya is over. We toppled the Government before the next Vesak Poya. Our duty is to topple the Government if it is possible. It is actually in the greater interests of the country. The previous Government alienated the national assets. If it continued, there would be nothing left in the country for posterity. We reversed the move to introduce a separatist Constitution. Otherwise, it would also have been declared as adopted by voice vote in Parliament. (Ekath Aye Uye gala sammatha karai)
In that context, we have taken a correct decision in the interests of the country. We also faced a similar problem with regards to the Free Trade Agreements at that time. The previous Government did not think of the country. They acted in their personal interest and the interests of foreign countries.
Q The change of Government has been subjected to criticism by a section of the international community; namely the western countries. How can a Government be run without the cooperation from the western countries
We have no grudge against the western world. Yet, the western world looks at us from a different angle. We are taking steps to change their attitude towards us.

Q What is your strategic plan to do it
We have already started it. We remain engaged with them. They have an ill-informed opinion of us. When a new ambassador is posted to Sri Lanka, he relies on information provided by predecessors. Their opinion is shaped in that manner. We are trying to give them the correct picture.
There are some persons attending parties thrown by the embassies. Actually, the opinion expressed by these party-goers cannot be taken as the common opinion of Sri Lankans. Mostly, the views expressed by these persons frequenting the embassies and high commissions are taken as the common position of Sri Lankans, unfortunately.
Only a handful of countries raise concern with us. The middle-eastern countries have no issue with us. Only a few western countries take up this issue with us. We would be able to correct it.
Most countries are alright with us. China believes that Sri Lankans have the wisdom to resolve their issues. Likewise, Russia also believes the same.
Q What are the Governments priorities till December 7
We have worked out a programme to give concessions to the agriculture sector. That was a neglected sector during the previous rule. We have focused attention on it. If we develop this sector, we can feed ourselves. We will pay more attention on the export-oriented industries. We have initiated talks for the development of the tourism sector through new promotional activities. We gave concessions to those sending foreign remittances. During the previous rule, people did not send foreign remittances. Even our expatriate workers who toil in the Middle East were taxed. We are correcting all these areas.
Q When you give tax concessions, it affects the Governments revenue. How do you address such concern
The Government did not receive much revenue by way of taxes levied on these sectors. We do taxation appropriately. We should not burden people in the process of taxation. As I always say, it is proverbially similar to sucking nectar from a flower without damaging it. That is our policy.
Q Once you joined hands with President Maithripala Sirisena, everybody thought that the factions of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) would be united. But, you obtained the membership of Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna(SLPP). Why did it happen
We formed the SLPP under the Pohottuwa symbol. We have operated that party from its inception. It is nothing new that I obtained its membership. In fact, I have virtually acted as a member of that party right from the beginning.
Q Wont it affect the identity of the SLFP
It will not happen. We will act as a common front. It does not matter whether we belong to the SLFP or the SLPP.
Q Would you be contesting future elections under the Pohottuwa symbol
We have talked about a common alliance. Discussions are underway for a common symbol. No final decision has been taken about the symbol. We have to choose a symbol which appeals the most to the people. I believe it should not be a symbol which requires to be introduced freshly to people. We are negotiating on this matter.
Q Some people think that the UNP received a boost as its members became active after their leader was sacked from the post of Prime Minister. How will it affect you
It happens normally in the event of an election. We expected it. The UNPers may remain silent. In the event of an election, they get active. It is a normal phenomenon. Let alone, at village level, the situation is totally different. People do not talk about Ranil or Sajith.
Whatever it may be, it is better for the UNP to discard vindictive politics. The UNP has a departure from politics followed by its founder leaders D.S.Senanayake and Dudley Senanayake. The UNP is actually a forum of mudslingers today. The UNP should correct its tarnished reputation.
Q There is an allegation that you took over the Government to cover up cases pending against your family members. Is it true
We have not done anything to cover up cases. We will not stop politics in fear of court cases. We will not shy away from them. We dont mind court cases instituted over our political activities. It is nothing new for us. We faced such legal cases in 1980s as well.
Q Are you planning to initiate action against the Central Bank bond fraud reported during the former rule
The President has already made a statement in this regard. He will look into it.
Q You maintained the position that the Financial Crimes Investigation Division (FCID) should be disbanded. What are you planning to do with it
We stick with the same position. It is up to the President to take any decision in this regard. We are against the establishment of such police units, comprising specially selected police officers, to politically victimise people. It conducted investigations regarding complaints sent by then Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe only.
Q There is a demand by the UNP to conduct an early presidential election. What is your response
Now, there is a question involving Parliament. It has nothing to do with the presidency. Therefore, a parliamentary election is appropriate.
Q In case, the Presidential Election is declared by the President, are you ready for it
Lets see it then!

Women take strong stand for  children and country
	
Activists and artistes brave rain to protest dark clouds of political crisis

everal Sri Lankan women activists, including prominent artistes, braved incessant rains in Colombo on Wednesday to gather at Galle Face on behalf of future generations, amidst the countrys growing political crisis. We are basically a group of frustrated, concerned women who have come together for our children, dramatist Tracy Holsinger said, adding that the the group had no political affiliations. If we dont stand up and say something now, this will go by. And we are just going to normalise everything, she said.
The protesters assembled at Galle Face at 3.00 pm and marched through the pouring rain to the Presidential Secretariat to deliver a letter to President Maithripala Sirisena. The letter highlighted their concerns regarding the political and economic chaos in the country, the irresponsibility and immorality of leaders, and the resultant threat to the nations children. It noted: Leaders of this country need to be elected in accordance with the constitution of this country. Thus without marring the truth by bringing in personal likes, dislikes or conflicts; we demand that you provide our citizens and our country with a stable and responsible political solution in keeping with our principles of governance.

"we demand that you provide our citizens and our country with a stable and responsible political solution in keeping with our principles of governance"
The letter went on to condemn the national disgrace and international spectacle surrounding the ongoing constitutional crisis. Mr. President, we and our children have only this country to live in. If this country is dragged into an economic and political abyss, it is we citizens who have to suffer the consequences, it stated.
Prominent artistes, film stars and writers joined the demonstration, which featured a character swaddled in yards of saree cloth with slogans in all three languages highlighting the protesters concerns for their children, country and future. Kaushalya Fernando, Chandani Senevirathne, Ruwanthie de Chickera, Nadie Kammallaweera and Ama Wijesekara were among the artistes who fronted the effort.Heavy showers marked the commencement of the event, but the rains failed to unhinge the spirit and persistence of the cause. The protesters declined transportation offers and proceeded to march to the Presidents Office, unsheltered and unfazed.

"Leaders of this country need to be elected in accordance with the constitution of this country"
During the demonstration, the women stood along the Galle Road and expressed their silent fury by unfurling their questions and demands inscribed on cloth in Sinhala, Tamil and English. As the rains persisted, so did they. Is the country your playground, Have you forgotten the promises of 2015, Do you have no conscience,were some of the scarlet-sprawled inquiries that caught the attention of passers-by.
As the activists advanced forward, five women took the lead, hand in hand, symbolizing unity amidst the confusion and chaos mentioned in the letter. Although small in number, the determination of the protesters who marched together as mothers and parents, was an inspiring sight.
The women expressed their disappointment with authorities who should be following the ethics, morals and justice taught to children. They questioned why Buddhist philosophies like honesty, delivering promises and principled behaviour, which govern the majority of the nation, appeared irrelevant and insignificant to
those in power.

	If we dont stand up and say something now, this will go by
	
	
	Mr. President, we and our children have only this country to live in
	
The movement sought more than just answers. They said nothing would justify the state of distrust and frustration now separating the people from their leaders. They demanded responsibility and the immediate rectification of the sequence of defamatory events that were set in motion by a single arbitrary and unilateral decision taken by (the president) on the 26th of October.
The letter raised concerns about the anti-democratic decisions and the consequent halt of foreign aid, economic sanctions, the negative popularity gained internationally, etc. So while being well aware of such economic, international and social impacts of poor governance, they were also loud and clear in what changes they wanted for the country and for their children.Mr. President, it is already very late. We demand that you do your job and stop this country from sliding further into darkness. What lies before you is your responsibility by a country and by the children of this nation, the letter stressed.

"If this country is dragged into an economic and political abyss, it is we citizens who have to suffer the consequences"
The protest also highlighted the absurdity of raising children in a land governed by persons who embrace the very vices that mothers struggle to protect them from. Although driven by an indignation for the crises unfolding in the political arena, at the heart of all the activity was a mother pleading, Please, in all of this madness, take a moment to think of the innocent children who will have to grow up in this country that you have begun to create.
