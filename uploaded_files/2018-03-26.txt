A school with aesthetics
	
There is a problem with aesthetic studies in Sri Lanka as the employment for aesthetic studies are limited.
In addition, mathematics is needed to follow higher education-the Advanced Level and beyond. The students must pass mathematics at the Ordinary Level examination.
The Chief Minister of the Central Province Sarath Ekanayake ten years ago set up the Mawilmada Risikala School a special school for aesthetic studies, which teaches aesthetics subjects in addition to the usual curriculum.
The students of school can qualify in the normal educational stream and also specialize in any aesthetics subject they prefer.
A group from the Mandala South Asian Performing Arts Dance Company of Chicago arrived in the school to teach the basics of Ballet and they, in turn, to learn Kandyan Dancing.
The Mandala SAPA offers ?powerful engagement with unique and expert dancers, musicians, storytellers, artists and educators whose origins reach from the Himalayan ranges to the Indian Ocean, from Persia to Indonesia.?

The website says:
?Mandala?s company dancers and musicians, teaching artists, and artistic collaborators and outreach partners bring folk and classical traditions, as well as current and hybrid innovations, to life. We promote cultural awareness and exchange through entertainment and education. For all global citizens, the splendour of South Asia abounds with Mandala.?
The group will stay for a week on a teaching- exchange programme.
Chief Minister Ekanayake met the group at the school and welcomed them to teach young students a subject that is not very common in the country- ballet.
The Principal of the school Ms E.M.U.P.M. Ekanayake said that there were now thirty students, who had entered the University and some had already completed their first degree.
?The school was established ten years ago has continued progress and the new exchange programme would bring better results,? she said.
Chief Minister Sarath Ekanayake said that this was the only way for students to go forward in aesthetic studies in the present education system.
The coordinator of this programme is Ms Vajira Aluthge

Chinese nabbed with Rs. 21mn worth gems
	
A 39-year-old Chinese national was arrested with gems worth over Rs. 21 million while he was trying to smuggle them into the country last night, BIA Deputy Customs Director and Customs Spokesman Vipula Minuwanpitiya said.
He said the suspect was arrested while he was leaving the Katunayake airport through the Green Channel with 12 pieces of Gemstones weighing 68.87 ct valued at Rs 21,131,227.
The suspect arrived at the Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA) from Shanghai, China, he said.
?He was arrested with gemstones like Ceylon Sapphire, Cat?s Eye, Ruby and Star Stones. The suspect was a worker at an expressway construction site in Colombo,? Mr. Minuwanpitiya said.
During questioning the suspect had told the customs officers that he had taken out several gemstones out from Sri Lanka earlier to sell in China and brought back the ones which could not be sold there, Mr. Minuwanpitiya said.
Mr. Minuwanpitiya told the Daily Mirror that more than 12 million people used to travel through the Katunayake airport annually and it was unable to check each and every individual who were passing the airport but people were being checked randomly to nab this type of illegal smuggling attempts.
The case was detected by Assistant customs Superintendents R.G.S. Wijewickrama, W.D.G. Vitharana, H.C.M. Peters, PMI Vimukthi and A.M.A.S Amarasinghe.
Investigations were carried out under the Directions of Customs Director O.M Jabeer and Deputy Director RCM Livera .
Later the gemstones were confiscated and a penalty of Rs 100,000 was imposed on the suspect, Mr. Minuwanpitiya said. (Chaturanga Samarawickrama and T.K.G. Kapila)

Cuckoo bird quiet due to mating season
	
Dismissing claims that the Koha or Cuckoo-bird is relatively absent during the current Avurudhu season, environmentalist Jagath Gunawardane said there was a low pitch in its song this year because of a change in its breeding pattern.
?The bird is actually going through the mating season in its breeding cycle these days and this is why we don?t hear its sound much despite the National New Year Season. One will be able to hear its sound louder by the last week in March and up to around April 5. It may go back to a low pitch after then,? he said.
He said the cuckoo bird is a species with an increasing population.
The belief among Sri Lankans is that cuckoo sounds its tune to herald the National New Year. People are usually awakening by this sound and they prepare themselves for the festival buying gifts, household items and colour wash their homes. (Yohan Perera)

Full membership to China a way out to revive SAARC: Experts
	
Foreign policy experts have said China should be granted full membership of the South Asian Association of Regional Cooperation (SAARC) to give new life to the almost defunct regional body owing to the rivalry between India and Pakistan, Myrepublica news reported on Sunday.
Addressing a two-day regional conference organized by Center for South Asian Studies in Kathmandu, Nepal, they maintained that it is high time the politicians in South Asia think about accommodating the emerging global power- China- in the South Asian regional framework if this region is to play a meaningful role in new world order in the making.
Professor Moonis Ahmar of Karachi University argued that the existing SAARC structure is not balanced.
?The only way to correct this structural imbalance in SAARC is to grant full membership to China. Although Pakistan and Nepal are in favor of making China a full-fledged member of SAARC, the observer status of China has not changed so far due to India's opposition,? he said.
Speaking at the conference organized with the theme South Asia Amidst a New World Order, Ahmar justified his proposal saying that China borders with at least five of the total eight member states of SAARC. Bangladesh is closer to China, while Afghanistan, Pakistan, India, Nepal and Bhutan share border with China.?
Former Nepali ambassador Shambhu Ram Simkhada argued that it is time for leaders in South Asian countries to put their thought on how to accommodate the rise of China as benign superpower in the backyard.
?China has emerged as a superpower. How do we accommodate is something that needs to be thought upon,? he said.
Most of the speakers in the conference had noted the importance of China in SAARC process as the fundamental global political order had witnessed a significant change in the recent years.
Experts had argued that the role of US had declined significantly especially after the ascent of President Donald Trump in power, the rise of China as benign superpower and the? surge in extremism in different parts of the world.
All this have left the world to embark in a new world order, the experts said.
?Three changes have brought tectonic shift in the world order. As the world is heading toward a new direction, South Asia is also in need to embrace a new concept,? said former Major General of Indian Army Dipankar Banerjee.
Arguing that the unipolar world had already changed into a multipolar world, the experts pointed out the need to forge appropriate strategy to reflect this change in the global political structure.
Speaking on the occasion, Executive Director of Regional Center for Strategic Studies, Sri Lanka, Gamini Keerawella argued that although the importance of South Asia had grown significantly with the global power balance gradually shifting from the west to the east, the South Asian region has failed to capitalize on it due to hostile relations persisting between India and Pakistan.
Experts also expressed concerns that SAARC had failed to convene for the past three years. The SAARC Summit proposed by Pakistan could not be held as India announced to boycott it alleging that Pakistan had given refuge to terrorist elements.

JLL Lanka releases 2018 real estate predictions for Sri Lanka
	
Steven Mayes - <U+200E>Managing Director, <U+200E>Jones Lang LaSalle Sri Lanka
Global real estate consultancy Jones Lang La Salle (JLL)recently announced the company?s predictions for Sri Lanka?s commercial office and retail markets in 2018, identifying opportunities related to the increased investments in the country and broad challenges in the face of policy inconsistency and a tighter fiscal environment.
JLL is a professional services and investment management firm offering specialized real estate services to clients in more than 80 countries worldwide. The Fortune 500 Company operates from 280 corporate offices with a global workforce of 70,000 providing management and real estate outsourcing services for a property portfolio of 4 billion square feet. ?We remain optimistic about the commercial sector real estate space,? noted JLL, Lanka, Managing Director Steven Mayes. ?However, we are advising our clients to remain cautious about retail and residential markets, both of which face challenges going forward.?
The commercial sector continues to gather pace buoyed by strong demand, especially in the international grade A space which is currently undersupplied in Colombo 1, 2 and 3. The residential sector, especially high end condominiums,faces over supply challenges, with the recent re-imposition of 15% VAT on condominium sales, denting sentiment further. Retail markets too demonstrate less sustainability, in the medium to longer term, due to the considerable number of ongoing mall development projects.
The existing stock of office space in the grade ?A? sector in Colombo is just over 1.5 million square feet. When considered in the context of anticipated total demand for Grade ?A? in 2018, at around 5 million square feet, it is very apparent that there is a shortage of about 200% in supply. Absorption of most Grade ?B? spaces have also seen an uptick, as occupiers run out of Grade A options and are forced to compromise with alternatives.
While an uptick in demand is expected for spaces in Colombo from IT and related sectors stemming from 2018 budget provisions for the sector, it would be prudent to note that IT companies typically prefer out of town locations and lower cost options to fit with their business model. The newly signed Free Trade Agreements with India and Singapore are also positives for the economy and the maintenance of robust demand for commercial office space. Infrastructure development focused on connectivity between Colombo and Kandy could potentially increase tourism activity, further infrastructure developments, logistics activity, and generate more general business, which will bring in more demand for office space in both cities.
Prospects for the retail sector look encouraging over 2018/19, but beyond this lies potential? excess supply issues. While the ongoing mall developments will experience the ?first-mover? advantage, those that follow may experience demand related issues due to a lack of brands to occupy space. The longer-term success of this sector is heavily dependent upon government policy, especially with import tariff rates and infrastructure spending, on roads and public transport, as traffic congestion is a major impediment to retail growth. In current retail outlets demand for space still outstrips supply, but the gap will narrow after 2019, with other malls coming on stream in central and secondary business districts and residential zones.

Lankan formulates mosquito repellent
	
Says it addresses all factors that attract mosquitoes
To repel the mosquitoes that spread dengue, filaria and malaria, an engineer has formulated a liquid.
?This liquid is pleasant to smell as well as it is safe on the human body.? It will smell for only five minutes but it can repel mosquitoes for 12 to 14 hours,?? Eng. ?
Rakitha Brito said. ?The liquid will not affect children or pregnant women,? he claimed.
?I have taken so much of time and energy to do the research and analysed the solution for the problem.? The main cause mosquitoes get attracted to human body is breathing -the release of carbon dioxide and the rate of releasing carbon dioxide is more in pregnant women.??
??When exercising there will be more chemical reaction in the human body and it will release lactic acid during the session, so that mosquitoes will be attracted to it according to research.Alcohol also attracts mosquitoes,? he said.? ??All over the world, people are still working on a solution to this.? Yet, the sprays aren?t effective and there are many side effects. ?
Normally we can prevent mosquitoes by preventing dark coloured clothes.
We should use yellow lights at home. We also could use Lavender and Maduruthalaa to repel mosquitoes.??
?I wanted to repel mosquitoes instead of killing them. The liquid gives a smell, which is not tolerated? by mosquitoes and functions as a repellent. I hope many people would use this.
I also hope it will spread around the world,??? Brito said.

While saying that the Central Bank?s former governor Arjuna Mahendran, the mastermind of the bond scam claimed to be the largest financial fraud in Sri Lanka, is still missing, Deputy Leader of Pivithuru Hela Urumaya (PHU),Madumadawa Aravinda said today they would complain to the Office of Missing Persons (OMP) about Mr. Mahendran going missing.
He told a news conference that Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe was connected to Mahendran?s disappearance.
?It was Premier Wickremesinghe who said he would take responsibility for the appointment of Mr. Mahendran who is a citizen of Singapore. How can we further trust the PM when he says he would bring Mr. Mahendran back to Sri Lanka? Everybody wants Mr. Mahendran to arrive in Sri Lanka and prove his innocence or guilt on the controversial Central Bank bond issue. It is questionable as to why the government appointed OMP in haste during the recent unrests period. However, we presume the OMP would consider our case and act efficiently to bring Mr. Mahendran back to Sri Lanka,? he added. (Sheain Fernandopulle)

UNP MP Ranjan Ramanayake yesterday called the opposition MPs including former President Mahinda Rajapaksa who accused him of insulting Supreme Court judges for a public debate.
Mr. Ramanayake was responding to the allegation made by the opposition MPs that he had insulted judicial offices using his parliamentary privileges.
The MPs last week complained to Speaker Karu Jayasuriya that Mr. Ramanayake was insulting the Supreme Court judges. The MPs said Mr. Ramanayake should not have been allowed to insult the judges.
?Speaker should look into this matter,? Former President Rajapaksa said while questioning as to where the Parliament would end up if the MPs used their privileges to insult others.
?Those who are accusing me of insulting the judicial officers are the very same people who insulted judges when they were ruling the country. These MPs insulted Former Chief Justice Shirani Bandaranayake. Judgments were decided upon at Temple Trees during that time,? Mr. Ramanayake said.
? I am challenging these MPs for a public debate and I will prove my allegations during this debate,? he added. (Yohan Perera)

Replanting the forests
	
?
One wild mushroom at a time
When she was a little girl, Nilanthi Kumarasinghe would fill a bowl with salt and chilli powder and head into the forest. Her parents were worried it was unsafe, but to her those were halcyon days. She and the other children ran wild, spending lazy afternoons climbing trees to pluck fruit, both sweet and tart; laughing and talking as they ate them with chilli powder.
?We grew up relying on the resources of the forest. We found things there that we could not find anywhere else,? Nilanthi remembers, describing how her father used to return from his forays into the woods with large baskets of wild mushrooms.
Their neighbours would bring home fruits, honeycomb and medicinal herbs.
Now 42-years old, Nilanthi is married and lives with her family in Mahakirindegama, a village near Mihintale in Anuradhapura.
Her mushrooms come not from the forest but from a little shed behind her house. The seeds are grown in sawed-off PVC bottles, each container filled with a combination of mango wood dust, magnesium sulphate, calcium carbonate, soya and gram flour and gypsum to hold it all together. She uses only organic fertilizers to keep pests at bay and swears by fermented garlic juice.
Each container in her shed yields about 750 grams of mushrooms before it must be replaced.
?
"Her product is in demand, all her neighbours buy from her, and she also supplies the local shops. In total, in a good month she earns Rs. 40,000."
For every 200 grams of oyster mushrooms Nilanthi makes Rs.60; abalones get her a little more, at Rs.80 per pack. Her product is in demand, all her neighbours buy from her, and she also supplies the local shops. In total, in a good month she earns Rs. 40,000.
Training and supplies from the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) helped her kick-start what is today a thriving business.
The Community Forestry Project is funded by AusAid and implemented by the Department of Forestry in collaboration with UNDP. It was initiated to reduce deforestation and forest degradation in the dry and intermediate zones of Sri Lanka.
?
"?In total, an estimated 10,000 households enjoyed direct benefits from the project, with indirect beneficiaries estimated to be some 90,000 people."
Field operations began in 2012, with the project being rolled out across 17 districts. 23,000 ha of forests were replanted in 167 sites and productivity was enhanced in over 3,000 home gardens. As part of the support to the Department of Forestry, motorbikes and computers were provided to field offices, thereby helping to improve their capacity and access.
?In total, an estimated 10,000 households enjoyed direct benefits from the project, with indirect beneficiaries estimated to be some 90,000 people.
?We, the women in this area, are the ones sustaining this project,? says Nilanthi with pride.

Currently, there are more than 100,000 people in Sri Lanka who have gone blind because of cataract and thousands are added to this number every year.
It has been estimated that there would be over 1 million people expecting to go through the cataract surgery in Sri Lanka during the next five years.
Cataract, ultimately results in complete blindness, but amazingly, a simple, quick, painless, low cost surgery can restore eyesight. Even though such a simple treatment is available, there are so many people in our country who remain blind due to various reasons ? a few of them being non- awareness of the possibility to cure the condition, not being able to access resources due to poverty, distance or maybe lack of someone to accompany, and also because of fear and lack of trust in treatment.
Giving Sight-Giving Life is a community service project, initiated by Dr Asela Abeydeera, President of the Sri Lanka Association of Community Ophthalmologists of (SLACO) supported by principle funding agency- the Karuna Trust.
How ?Giving Sight-Giving Life? began
Giving Sight-Giving Life was launched only six months ago, on September 9, 2017.
Dr Asela Abeydeera, the pioneer of this project has secured funding of the Karuna Trust to open an Eye Care Service Centre in Maharagama in order to carry out this project.
Dr Abeydeera is a Community Ophthalmologist, whose speciality is to prevent blindness by working in the community.
The Karuna Trust is a charitable trust of Mr Mahinda Karunarathne, a successful businessman.
Services rendered by the project
One of the main services rendered by the project is providing cataract patients of low-income families with free cataract surgeries.
During these six months, about 450 cataract surgeries had been performed through this movement. They have also provided around 200 free reading glasses to such patients.
In addition to this, more than 500 reading glasses have been provided for free to those whose eyesight weakens as they pass the age of 40.
The low-income families are selected after an interview process during examination and also after a certification by the Grama Niladhari and Secretary of the Pradeshiya Sabhas in the relevant authorities.
Anyone can walk in and get their eyes checked at the permanent eye clinic, The Karuna Community Eye Care Service Centre at 114/1, Dehiwala Road, Maharagama is open from morning to evening weekdays.
Optometrist, Shyama Wemalagunasekara, also the Director of the Sri Lanka Optometrists Association, manages the centre and refers the patients to cataract surgeries as a volunteering service, while also inspecting spectacles and conducting visual assessments.
Dr Abeydeera inspects patients on weekdays after 4.30 during his off hours.
Dr Nalin Gunasinghe also works one day. Even on weekends, Dr Abeydeera and his staff are engaged in the project.
There is also a steering committee Chaired by Mrs Sudharma Karunarathne, where they discuss further possibilities of enhancing the project.
?Most people who walk in are those who are not able to afford treatment. They may have no income at all. In the beginning, the patients who came were from around Colombo, mostly Maharagama itself,? Shyama Wemalagunasekara said.
?But we now have patients coming here from all over the island ? Badulla, Hambantota and even Wellawaya,? Ms Wemalagunasekara said.

Cataract and the cataract surgery
Having inquired about the nature of a cataract, Dr Asela stated that it was a condition where the lens in the eye loses its transparency becoming opaque causing the vision to be blurred and if not treated, will result in complete blindness.
?The cataract surgery is the only cure for the condition. Through this simple surgery, the natural lens is removed and an artificial one is replaced. A lens can be bought for Rs. 1,800 and they are readily available in the market. The cataract surgeries conducted by the Giving Sight-Giving Life project, are carried out in the HelpAge Eye Hospital, Wellawatte, Lions Eye Hospitals in Pandadura and Kadawatha and Suwanetha Eye Hospital in Gothatuwa.
?Once the patients are registered for surgery, surgery dates are fixed based on the availability of funds and eye surgeons in hospitals. We provide transport to the patients and bring them to the hospitals, conduct the surgery and then examine them the following day, a week after and a month later.
?If the patients are unable to come for the follow up examinations, we go to where they live and render that service to them,? Dr Abeydeera said.
?The cost to get a cataract surgery done in the private sector can sometimes cost about Rs. 80,000. But we provide a low cost service, which costs only Rs. 8,500 which includes the cost of the lens, hospital bill, utilities and staff payments all of which are discounted. While the surgeries are conducted by a few hospitals that we are connected with, we provide the funding through our donors,? he said.
Outreach Programmes
Giving Sight-Giving Life also conducts at least one outreach programme every month.
Dr Abeydeera and Opt. Wemalagunasekara recalled the outreache programmes conducted by them in Sithulpawwa, Aluthgama, Agalawatte, Hangwella, Deraniyagala.
They also informed about the upcoming outreach programmes to be conducted in Kamburupitiya, Akurassa and Hakmana.
?We take portable equipment and set up eye clinics in villages and towns, which generally are out-of-the-way places. About 300 people usually turn up for checkups. Once we identify cataract patients, we register them for surgeries and do the needful.
?We usually receive a request from a local authority or a community leader in the area to do an outreach programme, and we are always ready as time and money permits, to conduct them.
?We meet many people who have become completely blind due to cataract at these outreach programmes and it?s amazing to see how they regain sight after going through the operation,? Dr Abeydeera said.
Funding and donors
?The main fund for the project is the Karuna Trust. The Eye Care Centre functions completely on funds provided by the Karuna Trust. We have also developed a website (www.givingsightgivinglife.lk) for the project through which we receive many donations and hope to receive even more.
?We still need more funds in order to conduct outreach programmes. There are more than 200 patients who are still waiting for donors to fund their cataract operations? Dr Abeydeera said.
Other initiatives
Dr Asela informed us that they are now conducting a programme in the Maharagama Education Division across over 20 schools where they train schoolteachers to identify schoolchildren with eyesight issues and direct them to us.
?We have given the teachers an E-Card to do this and they have responded with lists of names of the children who need spectacles. We intend to bring them to the Eye Care Centre and issue them free spectacles. We have found a generous donor for this project alone. We hope to expand the programme to Hambantota and Bentota.
?We have also taken the initiative to set up satellite centres in rural areas, so that people with impaired vision, especially because of cataract, can be identified and sent to us, and we are able to do what we can to treat them.?
?
Muthumenika, who is almost blind due to cataract, praised everyone involved with the project.
?To everyone, one?s eyes are like a pair of jewels and should be always protected. Giving Life-Giving Sight is a truly meritorious initiative. We have been to both government and private hospitals, but we were not given a proper response or a good service. Here, we are provided a genuine voluntary service and for this the doctors, staff must be blessed by the Noble Triple Gem.?
?
Evigin Nona, who has already gone through an operation via this movement two months ago could not stress the value of the meritorious deed provided to society.
?I didn?t even have to know which hospital conducted my surgery because I was transported to the required hospital and everything was provided. Now I can see. These programmes are required in our country because everyone cannot afford to buy a pair of spectacles or spend for a surgery. Through these noble services, poor people can benefit and live a healthy life. We thank the Karuna Trust and Giving Sight-Giving Life for serving our community and helping people this way.?
In a day, where the rich become richer depriving the poor and needy of even the bare minimum that they are entitled to receive, serving our own community by not only providing free consultation and free spectacles but taking that extra step to conduct surgeries for cataract patients and see to it that they are fully recovered is a noble deed indeed.
The reality that a successful surgery can actually prevent such patients from becoming blind or even sometimes curing them of blindness is actually giving them their life.

## Title: SL needs Tamil leaders with a national perspective: Namal

SL needs Tamil leaders with a national perspective: Namal
	
Joint opposition MP Namal Rajapaksa has said Sri Lanka needs national leaders to represent the Tamils and that the country lacks a second generation of Tamil politicians.
In an interview with the Indian Express from Colombo, before flying to Russia as a poll observer, Mr. Rajapaksa said powerful Tamil politicians were needed to bring about reconciliation and harmony.
When asked whether he had looked at the post-war reconciliation process, he said reconciliation would take more time and wounds would not be healed overnight.
?It was never a war between the Sinhalese army and the Tamils but between the Sri Lanka government and a terrorist organisation. If you keep believing in regional political interests, your interests will be regional, and the solution too. So we need national leaders from the Tamils,? Mr. Rajapaksa said.
The full Interview; 
Q: You are seen as the next-generation politician from the family. How do you foresee your political future?
It depends on my destiny. Because modern-day politics doesn?t work on a dynastic background? Dynasties are part of Asian culture, but at the end of the day, what matters most is who is going to get into leadership.
Existence in politics is all about how you behave, how you work, how you spend time with people in your constituency? I will definitely continue in politics and see where it takes me.
Q: There has been conflict between minority communities and the majority Sinhalese Buddhist communities. How do you view this communal face of Sri Lanka?
Extremism is everywhere, not only with Islamic or Buddhist groups. It is about how the government tackles them. For example, if the government believes that Islamic radical groups are getting stronger and take the side of Buddhist groups, or they antagonise Buddhist groups by siding with Islamic groups, it will not be able to play the role of a government. A government should be ideally impartial, it shouldn?t follow radical or extreme elements. That is the only way to sort out communal problems.
Q: How deep is your Sinhalese identity?
Everyone believes in what they believe in. Protecting your own belief and culture is not extremism. I believe that it is always good to have a culture and belief in something. It is very important to take that forward to our next generation.
Q: Have you ever thought about looking at the reconciliation process of Tamils after the war, if they are being treated equally?
Reconciliation will take more time; wounds will not be healed overnight. It was never a war between the Sinhalese army and Tamils but between the Sri Lanka government and a terrorist organisation. In the process of reconciliation and bringing harmony, what we needed is powerful Tamil politicians. Unfortunately, we don?t have a second generation of Tamil politicians? Efficient and educated Tamil leaders were assassinated by LTTE? For a long-term political solution and representation, I feel political parties should give an opportunity to young Tamil leaders to come up, an opportunity to be in the limelight, get them media exposure and a role in decision-making for the country. By doing that, reconciliation will happen. If you keep on believing in regional political interests, your interests will be regional, so the solution too. So we need to have national leaders from Tamils.
Q: How do you look at relationships with India, China and Pakistan?
Sri Lanka always considers its priorities first. My father?s priority was ending the war, we worked with India, Pakistan, China, US and Israel for our goals. Our primary interest is development. So we invited Indian private sector companies to come here. When you see the huge Shangri-La hotel on the Colombo seafront, two huge structures being built next to Shangri-La are Indian investments. Whatever be the political interpretations surrounding the Indian Ocean region, I feel Sri Lanka should maintain a neutral position. While India was always like family in spite of misunderstanding or miscommunication, our China relations were based on religion, culture and commercial transactions dating back to the Silk Route.
Q: How close are you with your counterparts in other dynasties in neighbouring countries?
I am in touch with most regional parties and dynastic families. Even if we have to keep our country?s interests first, I have friendships with almost all of them. For instance, I speak to Rahul Gandhi. Bilawal Bhutto Zardari [Pakistan] and Sajeed Wazed [Bangladesh] are all my friends. Our families too interact often. When Rahul got elected president of the Congress, I called him personally to congratulate. Bilawal too is very close to me, whenever I go there, I stay at his house. Wazed was based in Washington DC earlier and now he is back in Bangladesh. I am not in touch with the Saudi prince [Mohammed bin Salman] but I am closely watching that young leader. I am sure he will look at his own culture and traditions to protect it while going into new avenues. Because 1.1 million Sri Lankans are in the Middle East, I am closely watching all developments in Middle Eastern countries.
The Qatar emir [Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani] is also young while Dubai has a young family coming up. It is very interesting to see this new generation of western-educated, Middle East leaders and how they are governing in traditional Arabic culture.
Q: Your view India, its politics and foreign relationships?
Domestic politics is up to them. But in the last four or five years, India has had a global presence under the rule of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
Now, Rahul is also making the same presence with his trips to the Middle East, Malaysia and Singapore. But there is criticism as well against the Modi government in Sri Lanka. Many feel that the current Sri Lankan President is adopting many policies of PM Modi. There is widespread criticism that the Sri Lankan President?s approach in issues such as corruption and the way he deals with Opposition leaders is similar to that of Modiji. But in a larger way, I strongly believe that Sri Lanka can play a major role, we can be a communicating point between India and Pakistan, whenever they want a dialogue.
Q: Can you describe how you, as a teenager, perceived the war?
Mostly it is men who start the war, and women and children die. People who start the war often forget the purpose at one point. So the war that was led by my father against LTTE was all about calculated damage, collateral damage. No war in the world has been won without damage. If you didn?t fight the war, what would have been the damage? The world would have called Mahinda a good man but because he finished the war, our women are able to lead a dignified life without being abducted by LTTE to fight for them; our children are now going to the school instead of taking up arms.
The war did have effects on my personal life as my mobility was restricted as the son of the President. But that was the time I played rugby in college. At one point, I had to change from Cardiff University in London to another following an attack and major security threats. But I don?t believe that there was a Tamil diaspora but only an isolated LTTE diaspora who created trouble abroad. Even protesters before the London High Commission had been speaking Indian Tamil, not Jaffna Tamil. If these Tamil diaspora are so worried about Sri Lankan Tamils, they should come and help Tamils here.

Sysco LABS - Bringing the CX revolution to Foodservice
	
Rasika Karunatilake ? Vice President, General Manager and Head of Shared Services at Sysco LABS in Sri Lanka
Customer experience (CX) is fast emerging as a key competitive advantage in today?s marketplace. In fact, according to Forbes? Blake Morgan, 75% of companies set improving CX as an objective for 2018. This is due largely to the way that technology can augment the relationship between businesses and customers, and the way that tech companies have disrupted industries by providing a superior customer experience. Industry leaders are now taking note and looking at how they can harness technology to create a more powerful customer experience. Sysco, the world?s largest foodservice company, is one of those leaders and together with Sysco LABS, they are reimagining the foodservice customer experience.?
Customer experience is the product of the interactions between the customer and the organization over the duration of their relationship. Traditionally, CX was relegated to interactions that happened in stores and with salespeople or products, but the explosion of the online marketplace has changed the expectations of customers. Along with being able to make purchases online, customers also expect organizations to behave more like their friends. For example, today an organization with a Facebook page will be expected to chat with customers through the messenger app, and most leading organizations will be expected to have mobile applications of their own to provide greater transparency and communication.?
Today?s CX improvements are numerous and diverse. Customers expect greater transparency on the supply chain and workflow of organizations - consider how it isn?t enough to know that your Uber is arriving, you need to know exactly how many minutes away it is and see its location on a map. This practice is being adopted by more and more industries; from food delivery services to airlines, organizations are trying to communicate with customers in real time.?
The customer service cloud is another emerging tool; using the massive amounts of data transactions produced, companies are able to not only save customers' time and effort, but also offer them fairer prices. In industries such as food supply, where the price of the commodity is prone to fluctuation based on supply and demand, cloud pricing allows organizations to use algorithms to assign the best price possible.?
Another major area of innovation in CX is smart stores. The implementation of augmented reality in stores is increasing dramatically; driven by advancements in the technology and in the internet of things, clothes retailers like Rebecca Minkoff?s are using smart mirrors to help customers virtually try on clothes, see if the item is available in other sizes, colors and much more. Amazon too is breaking into this space following their acquisition of whole foods. With Amazon Go they are creating grocery stores without checkout counters where customers are automatically charged for whatever they walk out with.?
Sysco LABS is working on achieving this level of CX innovation in the foodservice industry. With a focus on Sysco?s entire foodservice chain, ?from farm to fork?, Sysco LABS is reimagining every relationship with technology; the farmer and the food storage team, the relationship between the food delivery team and the restaurant operator, and the one between restaurants and customers. The innovations of the teams will ultimately allow restaurants to run smoother and grow by providing their customers with a better experience.?
In re-imagining this process, Sysco and Sysco LABS will be employing four core principles. The first is customer-centricity; bringing the customer into the room and having them weigh in on CX design decisions. Secondly, Sysco employs cross functional teams in the development of its CX; it isn?t enough to ask the supply team about delivery, or the Marketing Associates about pricing, innovations are driven by bringing everyone together so that the entire journey can be reimagined from end-to-end. Thirdly, Sysco LABS boosts Sysco?s culture of innovation with their Silicon Valley perspective and creativity; the team?s DNA in working with leading edge technologies and constantly pushing the envelope of possibility will be directed at CX. Finally, ?pace over perfection?, a core tenant of the leading tech companies of today; the philosophy of developing a minimal viable product, getting it into the hands of customers as fast as possible, and iterating based on its performance in the field.?
It is this structuring for innovation combined with access to Sysco?s unparalleled network of restaurants, that empowers Sysco LABS to be a leading force in re-imagining the foodservice industry.??

Tobacco-free nation: Sri Lanka?s dream
	
Manipulative tobacco cultivation no more a profitable livelihood
Infamously known as the silent killer, tobacco farming and consumption (chewing and smoking) has encroached in to the lives of many people with its unwavering stance as a global mafia.
The tobacco industry is so powerful that it has become a global challenge to eliminate this form of livelihood.
In Sri Lanka, tobacco farming is a main source of income for many farmers including those in the North and several other regions.
In a bold initiative to eliminate the use of tobacco by 2020, the Government is planning to ban tobacco cultivation as well.
While this is a far-sighted approach to a healthier nation, continuing deforestation practices, a decrease in soil fertility and exploitation of labour by the giant industry has raised concerns among environmentalists and health experts.
Several organisations such as the Centre for Combatting Tobacco (CCT) spearheaded by the visionary leadership of its Director Dr Mahesh Rajasuriya, in collaboration with the Presidential Task Force on Drug Prevention (PTFDP) has carried out several research programmes to identify the problems of this livelihood.
In an attempt to unmask the hidden agendas of the tobacco industry, CCT?s online information portal tobaccounmasked.lk was launched last year, giving details about tobacco companies, their employees, research and relevant statistics.
Hence the Daily Mirror sheds light on some of its key findings and the possibility of eliminating tobacco by 2020.
Harmful effects
Although the harmful effects of passive smoking, tobacco consumption and tobacco farming have been highlighted in most instances, the industry tends to make people forget about its darker side. Unimaginable amounts of money spent on advertising and marketing have made people come to a conclusion that smoking relieves one from stress and keeps their sorrows aside.
?Harm is multifaceted so much so that it is harmful in ways we would sometimes not imagine,? says Dr Rajasuriya in an interview with the Daily Mirror.
?In terms of farming, the harm can be to farmers, their families, farming lands and agricultural practices. Cultivating tobacco affects the quality of life of farmers and their families.
?It affects their health and well-being. It causes great exhaustion and stress, induces wheezing and other respiratory diseases such as the green tobacco sickness. In addition to that, it compels farmers to use child labour and, perhaps above all, it affects agricultural practices in a very fundamental way by distancing farmers from food production.
?The environment is negatively affected, too, in several ways: tobacco cultivation reduces the fertility of farming lands, tobacco cultivation cause emissions harmful to the environment and humans, mainly from tobacco barns or kilns.
?Further, tobacco is not a magical crop as is portrayed in media and promotional campaigns. It is labour-intensive, weather dependent and can be harmed by wild animals. It involves a high initial investment and is not profitable as it is portrayed to be. Further, I also have observed that these farmers have a significant amount of guilt that they contribute to the negative health impacts of smokers, especially young ones and that they contribute to death, disease and suffering.?
The Green Tobacco Sickness (GTS) is a type of nicotine poisoning caused by the trans-dermal absorption of nicotine from the surface of wet tobacco plants. Symptoms of GTS include nausea, vomiting, headache, dizziness and severe weakness. These symptoms may be accompanied by fluctuations in blood pressure or heart rate.
?
"Green Tobacco Sickness? is caused by the trans-dermal absorption of Nicotine..."
Alternative crops
As mentioned by Dr Rajasuriya himself, tobacco causes a lot of damage to the environment.
Reports by the World Health Organisation (WHO) show that tobacco cultivation has contributed to many environmental crises in a number of countries.
In many developing countries wood is used as a fuel to cure tobacco leaves and to construct curing barns. An estimated 200,000 hectares of forests and woodlands are cut down each year because of tobacco farming.
?Tobacco itself is an alternative crop,? Dr Rajasuriya said further.
?There are no ?tobacco farmers? in Sri Lanka, i.e. nobody grows tobacco exclusively. All of them have other livelihoods. Tobacco is one of them. Many farmers have other crops going right now.
?Farmers themselves and field agricultural officers suggested many alternative crops which could be grown when our team did the data collection. Some of these include corn, pea nuts, manioc, sugar cane, tomatoes, green beans, cow-pea, chilli, or (undu), aloe vera and kantola (thumbakaravila),? he said.
It has also been found that tobacco cultivation involves a great deal of pesticides which need to be used in all stages of tobacco growth.
Tobacco depletes soil nutrients at a higher rate and requires a regular input of chemical fertilisers. They tend to absorb nutrients such as phosphorus, potassium and nitrogen more than any other crop does leading to a decrease in soil infertility.
As a result, these harmful fertilisers not only poison farm workers and cause chronic health problems but they also seep into the soil and pollute waterways and ecological systems causing harm to livestock and food crops.
Tobacco farming regions in Sri Lanka
Other than for smoking, tobacco is also grown for chewing. Many farmers in the North depend on tobacco farming. In addition to that area, such as Galewela, Polonnaruwa, Mahiyangana, Ududumbara, Haliela, Buttala and Wellawaya have been reported as the major tobacco cultivating areas in Sri Lanka.
The CCT research team has visited areas covering Polonnaruwa, Moneragala, Puttalam and Matale Districts. Namely area such as Hingurakgoda, Polonnaruwa, Walikanda, Elahara divisions from Polonnaruwa District; Buttala and Wallawaya from Moneragala District; Kalpitiya from the Puttalam District and Galewela from the Matale District have been covered. It has been observed that farmers in Kalpitiya mainly grow tobacco for chewing, while other areas it is mainly to supply for the CTC.
Loss of income
WHO reports further confirm that tobacco not only impoverishes those who use it but it also puts an enormous financial burden on countries. The costs of tobacco use at national level encompass increased health-care costs, lost productivity due to illness and early death, foreign exchange losses, and environmental damage.
?Profit, in my opinion, if labour and mental agony is counted, is negative,? Dr Rajasuriya said, speaking about outcomes exaggerated by the industry.
?It is definitely not profitable as it is portrayed to be. For example, farmers believe that only about 5-10% of them draw a real profit out of it. A study done by the Sabaragamuwa University has actually proven that compared to other crops, tobacco farmers are at a loss of income rather than gaining profits.
?Material on credit and forward buying approaches of the CTC engage the farmers in a viscous cycle of tobacco cultivation, which leads to many negative effects as explained earlier. The main pitfall is farmers being blind-folded to measure the economic gain based on the amount of money received at one time rather than the calculation of actual profit when accounted for all the costs including the cost of labour of the farmer and his family members. Once you are in it, you are under the tight grip of the tobacco company. It is like these farmers? lives are no longer under their control!?
?
"The Govt. is planning to ban tobacco cultivation as well by 2020.."
?
A realistic vision
The vision to make Sri Lanka a tobacco-free country in 2020 could only be achieved if interventions could be done at grass-root levels. The CCT itself has taken on this challenge and is making steady progress. One fine example is the Mahakumbukkadawala Cigarette Free Village.
An advocacy programme was conducted targeting the shop owners who used to sell tobacco in their shops. The main aim of the programme was to minimise the availability of cigarettes and other tobacco products in the shops.
When asked if Sri Lanka could become a tobacco-free country in future, Dr Rajasuriya quite positively said yes.
?I know it sounds like a fairy tale. So, let me not tell you a fairy tale. Hence, these are some real stories. In all developed countries the number of smokers has decreased every year. In Sri Lanka, the number of smokers is going down despite it being on the rise in other developing countries. Bhutan, a neighbouring SAARC country is already free of cigarettes. We have outlawed tobacco smoking in public places and sale of tobacco to young people. We have outlawed smokeless tobacco products.
?There is adequate evidence to say that the tobacco industry is pumping money into cannabis legalization, as they can take over cannabis business once cigarette business becomes unprofitable in future. The tobacco industry has openly started to invest in other products other than cigarette business.
Speaking about the PTFDP Dr Rajasuriya said that they have been very effective in executing the anti-tobacco campaign.
?The President, his advisors and the technical team, led by Dr Samantha Kithalawaarachchi, appear to be genuine in achieving true progress in this field. However, there seems to be a concerted effort by the tobacco and alcohol industry to draw the attention of all of us away from alcohol and tobacco.
?In fact they want us to focus on illicit drugs use only. I am certain the President or the Task Force will not succumb to these heinous efforts of these multinational companies.
?So, yes, the signs are there, if you care to take a look. Not that Sri Lanka CAN become a tobacco-free country, it WILL! The journey has started, no doubt,? Dr Rajasuriya concluded.
?
Key research findings
?
	Farmers, tobacco barn/ kiln owners and other labourers involved in tobacco cultivation have alternative livelihoods, i.e. there are no ?tobacco farmers? in Sri Lanka.
	
	
	Tobacco cultivation reduces the quality of life of farmers and negatively affects agricultural communities.
	
	
	Number of farmers engaged in tobacco cultivation started decreasing prior to the Government?s announcement of its elimination.
	
	
	The main facilitative factors for tobacco cultivation are the Material on Credit and Forward-Buying strategies employed by Ceylon Tobacco Company (CTC).
	
	
	CTC uses CSI initiatives and political affiliations to recruit and retain farmers in tobacco cultivation.
	
	
	Farmers are more willing to give up tobacco cultivation with the Government?s support. However, barn owners, the CTC?s extended arm in the farming community, are not that willing.

Trump expels 60 Russians over poisoning in UK
	
US President Donald Trump has ordered the expulsion of 60 Russians from the United States on Monday, adding to a growing cascade of similar actions taken by western allies in response to Russia?s alleged poisoning of a former Russian spy in Britain, the New York Times reported a short while ago.
Poland, Italy, Denmark, France and Germany were among 14 European Union member nations announcing plans to expel Russians from their countries in solidarity with Britain, which previously expelled 23 Russian diplomats after the poisoning. Canada also said it would expel four.
The American expulsion order, announced by administration officials, includes 12 people identified as Russian intelligence officers who have been stationed at the United Nations in New York, and also closes the Russian consulate in Seattle.
The Russians and their families have seven days to leave the United States, according to officials.
The expulsions are the toughest action taken against the Kremlin by President Trump, who has been criticized for not being firm enough with President Vladimir Putin of Russia.
The officials said the action was a coordinated effort with other allies. Poland announced it will expel the Russian ambassador and several other diplomats in response to the poisoning. And Germany announced plans to expel four Russian diplomats within the next week.
In a call with reporters, senior White House officials said that the move was to root out Russians actively engaging in intelligence operations against the country, and to show that the United States would stand with NATO allies.
The officials said that the closure of the consulate in Seattle was ordered because of its proximity to a US naval base.

Watery grave for 8 bulletproof vehicles and LTTE vessel
	
The Navy today dumped in mid-sea the eight bulletproof vehicles earlier used by former presidents and a vessel seized from the LTTE.
Navy's Acting Media Spokesman K.K.C. Udayanga said the vehicles and the vessel had been dumped in the seas off the Western Coast with the approval by the government.
He said those bulletproof vehicles and the vessel were severely damaged and the best solution was to dump them in the sea.
?This is not the first time that such a procedure was carried out. Those bulletproof vehicles could not be crushed because of it hardy-build and also could not be auctioned because it could be used to commit crimes,? he said.
Lt. Commander Udayanga said the vessel which had been seized from the LTTE had been later used by the Navy.
?The vessel belonged to KP?s navy fleet and it will be dumped in the sea because of its poor condition. Once all the vehicles and vessels were dumped, the location will be converted naturally into a marine environment attracting sea animals including corals. This will eventually lure tourists,? he said. (Darshana Sanjeewa)
