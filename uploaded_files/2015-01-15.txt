Rs. 170mn loss to CPC from Sajin?s petrol station
	
The Petroleum Corporation has refused to issue fuel to a petrol station in Ambalangoda town which is said to have been owned by a well known politician of the former government due to his failure to pay a sum of Rs. 170 million due to the corporation.
Motorist say they have been terribly inconvenienced as a result of the fuel station not having fuel as only two fuel stations existed for the supply of fuel in the Ambalangoda Town. The only fuel station left for them was the one owned by the co-operative society which was now becoming crowded as a result.
A spokesman of the Petrol Station Owners Association said that the fuel was supplied by the Petroleum Corporation in Kolonnawa after the money was paid to the Corporation?s account. They said that the Corporation supplies the fuel according to terms and conditions of a circular.
The employees complained that the former Chairman and staff of the Corporation had supplied fuel to the errant owner of the petrol station in Ambalangoda, contravening the rules and regulations of the circular and thereby causing a huge loss to the Corporation.
It is said that nearly one million had to be paid for a bowser of petrol, because the fuel ordered by this petrol station owner from the corporation in Kolonnawa was supplied from the Regional Fuel Store in Galle adding that Rs. 750,000 had to be paid per bowser containing 6600 litres of diesel and that the profit from one bowser was only Rs. 15000 from which they had to pay salaries to the workers.
The owner of the petrol station was said to be former monitoring MP of External Affairs and former Galle District, Sajin de Vaas Gunewardena. (Janath de Silva and Chandrasiri Jasenthuliyana)

People want money back from Gammanpila
	
	Jathika Hela Urumaya (JHU) National organiser Nishantha Sri Warnasinghe today said that Pivithuru Hela Urumaya (PHU) General Secretary Udaya Gammanpila should pay back the Rs.100 which he collected from the people.
	While protesting in front of Udaya Gammanpila?s office at Tickell Road in Borella and in front of his residence in Athurugiriya, he said that now the JHU had seen how he betrayed the people and the party by going against the its policies.
	Mr. Gammanpila had requested the public to give him Rs. 100 each for his election campaign as he was unable to afford to campaign at the past Provincial Council election.
	?He stood for good governance and said anyone who had faith in him could offer Rs. 100 for his campaign as he did not have any means to run for office at that time and had accordingly collected Rs.4.7 million from the people,? Mr. Warnasinghe said.
	?The JHU electoral organizers are now faced with a problem in handing over the money back to the people. Several people have been asking Mr. Gammanpila to return their money and questioned as to why he had left the party. Meanwhile, Gammanpila has lodged several complaints with the police saying? that he and his family were getting death threats from unknown people. All the allegations being made by him are baseless,? he further added.
	?We have bank slips and receipts to confirm that the people deposited money in his favour. If you are genuine, please come to the electorates from the place where you are hiding, and hand over the people?s money. If you are unable to come, we can name the electorate, time and date for Mr. Gammanpila to explain his position and return the money he had collected from the people,? Mr. Warnasinghe said.

Fresh look at UNHRC probe
	
In its handling of the country?s foreign policy, the new Government has decided to look afresh at the OHCHR Investigation on Sri Lanka (OISL), a deputy minister said yesterday.
Deputy Foreign Affairs Minister Ajith P. Perera told Daily Mirror that he and Minister Mangala Samaraweera discussed this matter soon after assuming duties on Tuesday. ?
?We have to prioritize our engagement with this investigation process. We had a discussion in this regard,? Minister Perera said adding that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs would focus on the appointment of career diplomats and professionals to the Foreign Service while reducing the number of political appointments.
The investigative mechanism, for the probe on Sri Lanka, was set up in conformity with the resolutions adopted in March last year by the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC).
The resolution mandated the High Commissioner to undertake a comprehensive investigation into alleged violations and abuses of human rights and related crimes by both parties in Sri Lanka during the period covered by the Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission (LLRC) and to establish the facts and circumstances of such alleged violations and of the crimes perpetrated with a view to avoiding impunity and ensuring accountability with the assistance of relevant experts and special procedures by mandate holders.
The High Commissioner appointed three experts, Martti Ahtisaari -- former President of Finland; Silvia Cartwright -- former High Court Judge of New Zealand and Asma Jahangir -- former President of the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan, to play a supportive and advisory role, as well as an independent verification throughout the investigation.
The OHCHR had set up October 30, 2014 as the initial deadline for submissions.? The High Commissioner is expected to submit this report to the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) during its session in March, this year. (Kelum Bandara)
