Action will be taken against those responsible: Sagala
	
Action will be taken against the police officers involved in the alleged attempt to abduct Medical Faculty Students' Action Committee (MFSAC) convener Rayan Jayalath, if is is found that they had acted outside the provisions of the law, Law and Order Minister Sagala Ratnayake told Parliament today.
He said an investigation would be carried out to determine whether the police officers have violated the law and also whether the senior police officers involved in the incident had misused the junior officers involved.
The minister said the police officers had come in a police vehicle. "The IGP has issued a circular instructing that only police vehicles should be used for operations," he said.
The minister said six junior police officers in civies and three senior officers were involved in this operation.
"Rayan Jayalath was a person who had a warrans for his arrest for violating a court order with regard to a case pending against him in the judiciary. The police were only carrying out the court order to arrest him," he said.
The minister apologised for any disturbance caused to the people as a result of this incident.
However joint opposition parliamentary group leader Dinesh Gunawardene said it was a clear attempt to abduct Jayalath. (Yohan Perera and Ajith Siriwardana)

Erdogan in Qatar for talks on Gulf crisis
	
DOHA AFP July24, 2017-Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan arrived in Doha on Monday as part of a Gulf tour aimed at defusing a dispute between Turkeys ally Qatar and neighbouring Arab states. 
Erdogan was greeted by Qatari ruler Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani in Doha ahead of their first face-to-face talks on the Gulf crisis, state news agency QNA reported. 
Turkey has sided with Qatar in the crisis, the worst to hit the region since the 1981 establishment of the six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council. 
On June 5, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Bahrain suspended diplomatic and economic ties with Qatar over allegations that Doha had too close ties with Iran and supported Islamist extremist groups. 

Qatar has denied the allegations. 
Erdogan held talks on Sunday in Kuwait, which is leading mediation efforts in the crisis, and Saudi Arabia, where King Salman hailed the Turkish leaders efforts in the fight against terrorism and its financing. 
Erdogan has voiced support for the mediation efforts of Kuwait, a possible indication Ankara sees Kuwait as the key to resolving the crisis. 
Qatars emir on Friday said he was open to talks with the Saudi-led bloc on condition the emirates sovereignty was respected.

Government to rip up rules on switching sex
	
UK, (Daily Mail), 23 July 2017 - Adults will be able to choose their sex legally without the need for a medical diagnosis of gender dysphoria under government plans. 
Men will be able to identify themselves as women - and women as men - and have their birth certificates change to record their new gender. 
Minister for Women and Equalities Justine Greening said she wanted to cut the stigma faced by transpeople. 
At present they have to provide evidence that they have been in transition for at least two years before they can apply to legally change their gender. 
Reforms to help transgender people choose their legal sex, which include speeding up the bureaucratic process, will go out to consultation in the autumn. 
It comes after Prime Minister Theresa May earlier this week suggested she was preparing to reform the Gender Recognition Act.

Speculation is rife in political circles these days that a group of yahapalanaya backbenchers are set to quit the government and go independent in the council.

Meanwhile, a senior purohita who frequently calls these members to plead with them not to leave the government has become a real nuisance to them,they say.
This purohita holding a high post in the party would often entreat, Malli, please dont go! If you have any problem, let me know; just tell me what you want, you will get it forthwith!
Some of these members being pestered by the powerful purohita has stopped answering his calls. Ah! He is not at all worried about our problems. He is only keen on protecting his own perks and privileges, these members say.

Looking forward to building a future for youth
	
         PM marks 40 years in politics:       

Elaborate plans to celebrate Premiers milestone in parliament
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe with State Minister of Defense Ruwan Wijewardene and Minister of Regional Development Sarath Fonseka 

rime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe who met the old guards of the United National Party (UNP) in Biyagama, during an event held on Saturday to mark his 40th year in Parliament as an MP, went down memory lane reflecting about his political career and also took the opportunity to stress the need for securing a future for the youth. 
What we did in Biyagama from the time I entered politics was to build a future for the youth. Its important to build a secure future for the youth and for the future generations, Wickremesinghe said when he met party old guards in the Biyagama electorate. 
Premier Wickremesinghe thanked late President J R Jayewardene for appointing him as the UNP organizer for Biyagama. I am in debt to late President Jayewardene for introducing me to competitive politics and giving me a role to play in the revolution he created in 1977, he said. 
Questions were raised from me as to what I was going to do for Biyagama. Jayewardene began the Mahaweli Projects and the Katunayake Free Trade Zone. Then he questioned me as to what I was doing. Accordingly we came up with a plan to develop Biyagama. Some criticize me even now. They question as to what I have done during the past two years. We had to face a huge challenge in developing Biyagama. Some people in Biyagama were involved in brewing illicit liquor. Some were producing Beedi. There was no proper road network in the area when I first became the organizer. We wanted to change these and there are more than 100 factories, diesel power plants and many more in Biyagama today. It has also become an energy hub today, he said. He said State Minister Ruwan Wijewardene has been given the task of developing Biyagama today.

"I am in debt to late President Jayewardene for introducing me to competitive politics and giving me a role to play in the revolution he created in 1977"
We will make Sri Lanka a debt free nation by the year 2025. Biyagama development was implemented for the youth. Likewise this government will implement all these projects for the youth, Wickremesinghe further said. 
He then went on to pay tribute to late Presidents Premadasa and D B Wijetunga saying they had helped him in his career. Some who entered the political field with me are no more today. They include late Gamini Dissanayake, Gamini Athukorala and Weerasinghe Malimarchchi. I pay a tribute them as well. He also paid tribute to the late Cyril Mathew from whom he took over the post of Kelaniya organizer. During this time he took over the post of Biyagama organizer. He further paid tribute to old UNPers in the Biyagama Bala Mandala including Andrew Silva, Jaganth Rajakaruna, Henry Gunasekera, Sunil Gunasekera and Shelton Sebastian.

Meanwhile Chief Government Whip Gayantha Karunatileka told a media briefing that Parliament will be celebrating this special occasion this week. He said that Wickremesinghe had served the nation for four decades in various capacities, as a minister, leader of opposition and as the Prime Minister. He said that there were also those who criticized Wickremesinghe. 
Venerable Thiyawala Palitha Thera, speaking at a religious ceremony held at Kelaniya Rajamaha Vihara to mark Premier Wickremsinghes 40 years in Parliament, suggested that 40 development projects be implemented to mark the occasion. Working for the people is important and celebrating your feat should be made meaningful, the Thera said. 
A special session in Parliament is to be held to pay tribute to the Prime Minister. Several other religious programs have been organized at Kolonnawa Purana Rajamaha Vihara and at Jumma Mosques in Kolonnawa today. 
Wickreemsinghe entered active politics in 1976 when he was appointed as the UNP organizer for Biyagama. He later entered Parliament in 1997. He then became the minister of Education and Youth Affairs and then became the leader of the House in 1989 under late President Premadasa. He became the Prime Minister in 1993. Later President Wijetunge appointed him as the minister of industries. He became Leader of the Opposition for the first time in 1994 following the assassination of Gamini Dissanayake. Wickremesinghe became the Leader of the Opposition in 1999, 2004 and in 2010. He became Prime Minister for the second time in 2012 and for the third time in January 2015. He became the Prime Minister yet again after the general elections held in 2015.

Maldivian government locks down parliament
	

The Maldivian opposition says the military has locked down parliament on the orders of the countrys president in a bid to prevent lawmakers from taking part in a vote to impeach the parliamentary speaker.
The opposition Maldivian Democratic Party says that on the orders of President Yameen Abdul Yameen, the gates of the parliament were padlocked by members of the armed forces on Monday and lawmakers were forcibly prevented from entering the parliamentary compound. A no-confidence motion against Speaker Abdulla Maseeh Mohamed was scheduled to be taken up on Monday. The opposition says the motion has gained the support of 45 lawmakers in the 85-member house.
The motion deals a severe blow to Yameen, whose control over parliament was threatened by a coalition of four main opposition parties.

Microsoft Paint to be killed off after 32 years
	
Microsofts next Windows 10 update, called the Autumn (or Fall in the US) Creators Update, will bring a variety of new features. But one long-standing stalwart of the Windows experience has been put on the chopping block: Microsoft Paint.
First released with the very first version of Windows 1.0 in 1985, Paint in its various guises would be one of the first graphics editors used by many and became a core part of Windows. Starting life as a 1-bit monochrome licensed version of ZSofts PC Paintbrush, it wasnt until Windows 98 that Paint could save in JPEG.
With the Windows 10 Creators Update, released in April, Microsoft introduced the new Paint 3D, which is installed alongside traditional Paint and features 3D image making tools as well as some basic 2D image editing. But it is not an update to original Paint and doesnt behave like it.
Now Microsoft has announced that, alongside Outlook Express, Reader app and Reading list, Microsoft Paint has been signalled for death having been added to the features that are removed or deprecated in Windows 10 Fall Creators Update list.

Falling under the deprecated column for apps that are not in active development and might be removed in future releases, Microsoft Paints ticket has been called and now its only a matter of time before it is removed like your favourite piece of old furniture from your childhood home.
Paint was never one of the most capable apps, and was limited to the bitmap (BMP) and PCX formats until 1998, but if you wanted to scribble something out using your mouse or make a quick cut and paste job, Paint was always there, even on work computers.
The most recent version of Paint for Windows 7 and later was much improved, but still considered feature poor compared to other free alternatives such as the third-party Paint.NET.
When Microsoft Paint will officially be removed from Windows has yet to be confirmed, while a precise date for the release of the Windows 10 Autumn Creators Update is equally up in the air. Whether, like Clippy, Windows users will celebrate or decry Paints removal, it will be a moment in the history of Windows as one of its longest-standing apps is put out to pasture.

Negombo Worst hit tourist city!
	
Its visible that the city worst hit by dengue in the country is Negombo. Director General Health Services of Western Province Dr. Ahemed Fareed told Daily Mirror that plans have already been carried out by the health authority to initiate new programs and control the spread of dengue in the Western Province, especially in Negombo.
Dr. Fareed said that the health authority has deployed 50 labourers to Negombo and 40 to Colombo to clean up drains and assist hospital staff. At the same time, we have established new dengue control units in the Western Province. 


At the same time, unless we get used to dumping dirt at appropriate places, we might not care much about dumping garbage at allocated places
  Dr. Ahemed Fareed  


The current situation is pathetic- Dr. Ahemed Fareed 
Most number of cases has been reported in May and June due to the inclement weather condition experienced from April till the end of May. Its clear that rain has been one of the core reasons for the rapid prevalence of the dengue infection. Apart from the consequences of rain, the garbage issue also has made a massive impact on the spread of dengue. When the garbage disposal process isnt carried out properly, the larvae of dengue can survive with ease. Its we who set the background for the mosquitoes to greed their grounds as we lack concern regarding the disposal and segregating of muck collected in our houses. At the same time, unless we get used to dumping dirt at appropriate places, we might not care much about dumping garbage at allocated places. If you dont pay attention to this matter, you will have to face the consequences. Therefore, its really essential to be mindful and take precautions, so that the prevailing situation of dengue doesnt worsen, he added. 
The current situation of dengue is indeed pathetic, when we examine the latest updates regarding patients. The Epidemiology Unit told Daily Mirror that there have been 103,114suspected dengue cases reported since 2017 from all over the country. Out of this figure 275 deaths have been reported so far. Approximately 43.67% of dengue cases were reported from the Western Province. 
The Western Province has recorded 45,030 cases so far this year, the most number of cases when considering all provinces. Consultant community physician at the National Dengue Control Unit, Dr Preshila Samaraweera told Daily Mirror that the main reasons for this are the huge piles of garbage which have been rotting for weeks along with drains not being cleaned. 

Colombo statistics bloated unnecessarily 
A number of hospitals are loaded with dengue patients, especially the Negombo Base Hospital because the area is now under the spotlight for dengue. Although a substantial number of cases has been reported from Colombo, Negombo is deemed to be the city most severely affected by dengue. The reason for this is because when most of the people from rural areas come to Colombo to take treatment for dengue, these statistics are added to the list of patients in Colombo. Thats why the number of dengue cases is considerably high in Colombo, she said. 
With the rapid increase of dengue patients, we will be granted two temporary additional wards which are being built for the in-house dengue patients
 Dr Preshila Samaraweera 


Meanwhile, there has been congestion in some hospitals especially in the Negombo Base Hospital. This is due to the inadequacy of beds in relation to the number of in-house patients at the hospital, the Director of Negombo Base Hospital Nilanthi Pathirana told Daily Mirror.
There are nearly 4,500 patients and 12 deaths have been reported so far from the Negombo Hospital. Although, there are nearly 800 dengue in- house patients now in the Hospital, the beds remaining are only 569. The following information illustrates the number of cases reported since January 2017 in Negombo, she said. 

"There are nearly4,500 patientsand12 deathshave been reported so far from the Negombo Hospital"
Jan -123, Feb - 95, March - 129, April - 218, May  467, June  1884 and July-934 
She mentioned that the issue has emerged following the ongoing construction of the main building of the hospital which will be completed soon. She nevertheless stated that the situation seems to be under control as the Out Patient Department (OPD) is sufficiently geared to treat a considerable number of dengue patients. 
With the rapid increase of dengue patients, we will be granted two temporary additional wards which are being built for the in-house dengue patients. This is an initiative of the Army present at the Negombo Hospital premises. When the President paid a sudden visit to the hospital, he had noticed that the institute lacks sufficient facilities to accommodate in- house patients. The President had then instructed the current Chief of Defence Staff and former Commander of the Sri Lankan Army, Crishanthe De Silva to look into the matter and take necessary measures. Even though there is a problem at present for patients to find accommodation, we try our level best to mitigate the inconvenience caused and supply a possible service to the people, she added. 
Confidential sources revealed that10 doctors and 20 staff members of the Negombo Hospital have been affected by dengue. Besides, this situation depicts the real gravity of dengue in Negombo city. However, when we contacted Dr. Lakkumar Fernando and inquired about this situation, he totally denied these facts. He said that there are only 3 doctors who were affected by dengue. Director General of Health Services of Western Province Dr. Ahemed Fareed also said that a lesser number of doctors and staff members suffer from dengue, both in Negombo as well as other regions. 
The following table denotes the number of patients reported month wise in 2017.

Ravi's late attendance causes stir in House
	
Foreign Affairs Minister Ravi Karunanayake walking in late for parliamentary sessions caused a stir in the House today.
A few minutes earlier Chief Opposition Whip Anura Kumara Dissanayake asked why the minister was not present to answer a question."The minister had informed the Presidential Commission of Inquiry that he was unable to be present at its proceedings as he had to attend Parliament. However, he is not present here either," Mr Dissanayake said.
The minister arrived at around 2.30 p.m. and said he was late because he was with President Maithripala Sirisena and some diplomats. He then answered a question asked by JVP MP Bimal Ratnayake. (Yohan Perera and Ajith Siriwardana)

Ravi unable to appear before PCoI today: Counsel
	
A counsel appearing for former Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake yesterday informed the PCoI that the minister would not be able to appear at the PCoI today to summoned to do so.
The PCoI had earlier summoned the minister to testify at the PCoI.
Counsel Sandun Gamage appearing for the minister said according to his limited instructions, the minister would not appear before the PCoI today and that the minster had said he would inform the PCoI of the date he would be able to attend the inquiry.
The submission was made at the end of yesterdays PCoI proceedings by Minister Karunanayake's counsel.
Subsequent to the submission, there was a heated argument between Additional Solicitor General, Dappula de Livera and the minister's counsel.
The ASG was of the view that the counsel should have informed the PCoI about the matter at the beginning of the proceedings and the reason for the failure to appear before the PCoI clearly mentioned.
The counsel said he was instructed by the minister about a Cabinet meeting. Then the Commission questioned the counsel whether Cabinet meetings were normally held in the evening.
However, the ASG was of the view that if the reason was to attend a Cabinet meeting then the reason must be clearly mentioned with the details.
The ASG informed the PCoI that they had not lined up another witness to testify at the PCoI today in place of the former finance minister.
The PCoI also emphasized that it would consider the minister's request and directed the counsel to inform the earliest date on which his client would attend the inquiry.
The Commission made these directions considering the time constraints. (Shehan Chamika Silva)

SLs tourism industry  feels the sting
	
The prevailing situation regarding dengue in Sri Lanka will definitely have an effect on Sri Lankas tourism industry. The island attracts visitors from other countries by virtue of its biodiversity and strategic location. When examining the impact on the tourism industry, Director of Public Relations at the Sri Lanka Tourism Promotion Bureau, Dushan Wickramasuriya, revealed that there is some sort of an indirect impact on the Sri Lanka tourism industry due the present dengue epidemic. He said that as a result there has been a considerable decline in the arrival of foreigners since May. The Monthly Statistical Bulletins, which offer information regarding tourist arrivals and hotel occupancy, provides the following information for the period between January to June 2017
The data released by the Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority (SLTDA) reveals that Sri Lankas tourist arrivals declined in March by 2.5 percent compared to the same period last year. Wickramasuriya further stressed that the reason for the decline in the arrival of foreigners doesnt only depend on dengue alone, but it has been one of the core grounds for the drop in the number. 
Tourism Minister, John Amaratunga told Daily Mirror that the country hadnt been able to record the expected tourist arrivals during the month of June mainly due to the floods, dengue outbreak and the garbage crisis. 

"If you need emergency medicalassistanceduring your trip,dial 011 2691111and ask for an ambulance"

The dengue epidemic itself didnt adversely affect the tourism arrivals this month. When the flood situation was on the surface, there was a considerable decline in the arrival of foreigners. But now the floods are over. Even dengue is now on the decline, so we are confident that tourist arrivals will receive a boost and we will be able to achieve our targets, Amaratunga said. 
He added that tourist arrivals established a record last year with the figure reaching 2 million. The authorities are expecting an additional 2.5 million tourists to arrive this year. 
The United Kingdom High Commission declared that the UK Government has issued a health advisory to visitors from the UK ensuring that their people are secure from the prevailing condition of dengue. This kind of travel advisory indicates that dengue in Sri Lanka is pathetic. The travel advisory is as follows as: All regions of Sri Lanka experience outbreaks of the mosquito-borne dengue fever.

Tourism Minister, John Amaratunga told dailymirror that the country hadnt been able to record the expected tourist arrivals during the month of June mainly due to the floods, dengue outbreak and the garbage crisis

103,114 suspected cases of dengue fever have been reported between January and July 2017 compared to 55,150 cases reported for the year 2016. You should take steps to avoid being bitten by mosquitoes. If you need emergency medical assistance during your trip, dial 011 2691111 and ask for an ambulance. You should contact your insurance/medical assistance company promptly if you are referred to a medical facility for treatment.

Dengue hasnt caused damage yet - sltpb Chairman 
Chairman of Sri Lanka Tourism Promotion Bureau (SLTPB), Udaya Nanayakkara, pronounced that the existing dengue situation hasnt affected the tourism industry. 
I admit that the dengue issue in Sri Lanka is extremely serious. But with regard to tourism, the prevailing circumstances pertaining to dengue havent yet cased any damage or loss to the tourism industry in SL, he said. 
He revealed that although there is a general tendency to see a drop in foreigners this season, he didnt see dengue to be the reason behind this. He nevertheless said that this situation will change by September and more foreigners will be arriving in Sri Lanka. 
When contacted, Hoteliers Association President Sanath Ukwatta, said that there has been a substantial decline in the arrival of foreigners in connection with some of recognized hotels in Sri Lanka like Gall Face Hotel, Mount Lavinia Hotel and Cinnamon Grand Hotel. On the hand, one of the directors of Galadari Hotel said that they are conducting their work without a hitch and they arent experiencing a decline in foreigners.

Staycation ideas : Trincomalee
	
With the long August school vacation looming, ideas to entertain the family during the holiday season are uppermost in most peoples minds. While some may opt for vacations in foreign climes, others will take the opportunity of exploring Sri Lanka. If a staycation is your choice, here are some ideas that may help you decide where to spend the holiday season.
Trincomalee is a coastal bastion which has been an attraction for visitors from time immemorial. It is blessed with a natural harbor which is the envy of the entire world while white sandy beaches and historic sights add to the allure of Trincomalee, making it the jewel of the North Eastern Crown. During the second world war, Trincomalee was the British naval headquarters and had an airfield from which US planes operated against the Japanese in Myanmar and Malaya. The town has a distinct charm with sleepy backstreets dotted with colonial villas that stand next to mosques, Hindu temples and churches. Steeped in history, various ethnic groups call Trincomalee their home which is melting pot of religions and cultures.
Situated 273 km away from Colombo, Trincomalee is serviced by busses and trains from Colombo. Train timetables are available on the internet but subject to change. Busses offer a more frequent travel service departing from the main bus terminal in Fort.
Swami Rock

Lovers Leap as this is also called is a high cliff which has a touching story behind it. Attested by an inscription on a pillar at Swami Rock the story goes that in 1687 Francina Van Reed the daughter of a gentleman of rank in the civil service of Holland was engaged to a young Dutch officer. He broke off the engagement and when his period of foreign service was over, left for Holland. The distraught girl watched the vessel from the promontory of Swami Rock and as the ship, taking away the man she loved, passed the precipice, she flung herself from the rock into the sea  a sheer drop of almost 130 meters where she ended in a watery grave.
Koneswaran Temple
Next to Swami Rock stands the Koneswaran Temple, one of the islands temples dedicated to the Hindu God, Shiva.
Hoods Tower Museum
The naval museum of the Sri Lankan navy is located at Ostenburg in the peninsular within the naval dockyard. The museum is named after Samuel Hood, who was the Commander of the East Indies Station. There is also an observation tower called Hoods Tower. In the nineties, the navy developed the museum which has many artifacts. Much of the museum is housed at ground level with some underground casements built during World War 11. Housed underground is a collection of weapons -equipment and weapon system used by the Navy. Please obtain prior permission before visiting.
Dutch Bay
Slap bang in the middle of Trinco is the most scenic bay. This picturesque Dutch Bay is more a place for strolling and enjoying an ice cream. An ideal beach front location to indulge in people watching while enjoying the sea breeze. In the evening the place comes alive with food sellers offering hawker style street food. Swimming is possible but be aware of dangerous undertows.
The Commonwealth War Cemetery
During World War II, this naval bastion played host to several thousands of allied forces. Many of those that perished during the Japanese bombing of Trincomalee in 1942 are buried at the Commonwealth War Cemetery. Row upon row of headstones stand to attention amidst perfectly manicured lawns lending an aura of nostalgia to the surroundings. Located near Nilaweli, a visit to this is recommended to appreciate the beauty of one of the last vestiges of the second world war on Sri Lankan soil.
Nilaweli Beach
By far one of the best stretches of beaches in Sri Lanka, the Nilaweli beach has miles and miles of pristine golden sand and azure waves that lap gently on the shore. A true idyll, this is perfect for some serious rest and relaxation. Pigeon Island which lies off the coast of Nilaweli is also worth a visit. Boat rides can be negotiated from the few hotels that dot the beach.
Fort Federick
Built by the Portuguese, this fort was initially a triangular fort named the Fort of Triquilimale by the Portuguese who equipped it with guns captured from a Danish fleet ship. In later years the Fort was rebuilt by the Dutch. Today British Insignias crown the tunnel like gateway that pierces the forts massively thick walls.

Sumitra Peries: The agony of being more than a woman
	

"Within 20 years, Sumitra Peries became our most accomplished editor. In the movie industry there is almost, always a discrepancy between craftsmanship and imagination"

In Vaishnavee, Yashoda Wimaladharma does what Gamini Fonseka did more than 20 years ago in Loku Duwa: divert the story to an entirely different mood and terrain. Fonseka did it rather effortlessly, since a man who was depicted as the hero (and our hero) for over 30 years, couldnt just be depicted as a beastly womaniser without jolting the audience. What could hence have been a weakness on the directors and the editors part, therefore, proved to be the best point about the movie. Fonsekas intrusion into the story isnt forced, or compelled artificially. As the father of the protagonists friend, he was expected. He is as hilarious as he is dislikeable, though not quite empathetic: a near-perfect culmination to a near-perfect career. 
What Fonseka achieved in Loku Duwa, Yashoda tried to achieve in Vaishnavee. But the director, Sumitra Peries, intended something different. The first half of Vaishnavee is about the innocence of its locale and characters. The second half turns the tables on everyone, including our protagonist, Osanda, and his cousin, Ruchira, when Yashodas unnamed puppet-come-alive starts terrorising them. As I noted in my review, Yashoda is by default an actress who can convey both empathy and coldness, sometimes at once. But one senses an incongruity in Sumitras movie, partly owing to her. We never properly understand her intentions, and her passing remark right before the story closes (that love cant be taken for granted) is at best vague. 


"The fact that her best work, Sagara Jalaya, was unnoticed when it was first released spoke a lot about who was being selective and unfair by her"

Some of the best movies are born from moral simplification. The morality of Vaishnavee is rooted in Osandas feelings of hurt at being rejected by his betrothed, who elopes with another man. What complexity we are given, as viewers, we get through his impulse to carve what he liked about his betrothed into a puppet: in effect, he is using the puppet to visualise what he could not get from the woman he was to marry. So when that puppet does come alive, she is as confused as we are as to why Osanda does not take to her. And so she does the inevitable. She taunts him. Its the kind of moral simplification that the most discerning artists go for in their later careers. With Vaishnavee, Sumitra has hence joined Ray, Kurosawa, and John Ford. 
Elegantly composed, indulgently shot, the movies of Sumitra Peries have never been reviewed with the frame of reference they deserve. Critics have pigeon-holed her, either as a feminist film maker or as her husbands wife. Even the writers of that otherwise ambitious book, Profiling Sri Lankan Cinema, end up condemning her on the basis of feminist ambitions she probably wasnt even aware of. By categorising her as a womans director, they rationalise her artistic failures as failures of intention and ambition. The fact that her best work, Sagara Jalaya, was unnoticed when it was first released spoke a lot about who was being selective and unfair by her. 

I think Sumitras greatest achievement has been her ability to transform popular fiction into serious cinema. By serious I am not pigeon-holing her; I am merely suggesting that when compared to the emotional hysterics of Leticia Boteju, Edward Mallawarachchi, and (to a lesser extent) Karunasena Jayalath, her movies are more composed. There are sequences of astonishing power which are held back so poignantly that they can only belong to the cinema: Vasanthi Chathurani bemoaning her cruel destiny at the end of Gehenu Lamayi, Ravindra Randeniya murdering his lover (Geetha Kumarasinghe) and her daughter in Maya, and Geetha discovering her lovers duplicity in Loku Duwa. Watching these makes one realise that her foray into the movies was informed, not by the romanticism of Renoir (as with her husband), but by the austerity of Bresson and Dreyer, particularly the latter. 
Sometimes however, she gives into what can only be described as a tendency to overindulge. One sees it in Gehenu Lamayi (the last half-hour), Ganga Addara (Nirmalas wedding), Yahalu Yeheli (Mudithalatha grappling with her cousin on a stack of hay), and Loku Duwa (towards the end). One does not see it in Sagara Jalaya, because its her least imperfect movie: consequently, even in sequences which might have been overindulgent by the standards she set for her other work (like the final confrontation between Heen Kella and her sister), we are subtly made to forget how overwrought they are. In that sense Loku Duwa was a sequel of sorts to Sagara Jalaya, since both are about women as hard-done-by fighters (unlike Mudithalatha from Yahalu Yeheli, who could only be depicted as a fighter by manipulating the narrative). 


"Critics have pinned her down as a womans artist, forgetting that her movies arent about women, rather about women trying to be more than who they are"

Critics have pinned her down as a womans artist, forgetting that her movies arent about women, rather about women trying to be more than who they are. To be sure, they are sometimes subservient to a largely patriarchal world, but even then they aspire for more than they have. In that sense, Kusum in Gehenu Lamayi is more rebellious than her sister Soma (Jenita Samaraweera), who dreams of life in the movies. She falls in love with a man she is cautioned against marrying (owing to her social standing), and in the subsequent clash between her desire and insecurity, we come across our cinemas first real tragic female figure, overshadowing even her sisters tragedy, which we anyway expected given her hubris. 
Sumitra Peries came to the movies as a director in the eighties, when a veritable onslaught of directors and actresses and scriptwriters ensured that women would be depicted as the fighters they had been told not to be all their lives. These actresses came in a particular order; Nadeeka Gunasekara, Swarna Mallawarachchi, Anoja Weerasinghe. But there was a contradiction in some of the movies which featured them. Fearless, daring, and frequently aggressive, they were represented as harbingers of intense, sometimes forced eroticism, which repelled us from them. (A case in point was Tissa Abeysekaras Mahagedara, where Geetha Kumarasinghe, who was supposed to awaken our moral conscience, actually nauseated us, thereby making hypocrites of us all.) Even in otherwise landmark and frank productions like Hansa Vilak and Thunweni Yamaya, the eroticism was intellectualised, not felt. 
None of Sumitras movies depicts sex, but what eroticism there is, she doesnt nauseate us to the point of titillation. After the unforgiving violence of Duwata Mawaka Misa, she returned to form with Sakman Maluwa, where love is no longer expressive, complicated, repelling. On the contrary, her later work, right until Vaishnavee, is morally both simple and profound, simple because her craftsmanship comes through effortlessly, and profound because even her most banal sequences enchant us. Given that its her most recent movie, Vaishnavee indicates the latter point well: its characters, like Osandas father and grandmother, are defined in clear-cut, empathetic terms. They are not overwrought simply because she doesnt need them to be. She has reached that place where a director can go on shooting a character talking, talking, and talking in a static, square frame while retaining the audiences interest. 

"Its a truism that can be sustained anywhere that directors, unlike novelists, painters, and composers, tend to become more frenzied as the years pass by"

Not surprisingly, the contradiction that makes up even the most sincere womans director doesnt come through in her movies. I was taken aback by Vijaya Kumaratungas impulsive rape of Swarna Mallawarachchi in Kadapathaka Chaya, for instance, but while I was intrigued by how crudely and carelessly it was edited, I wasnt exactly moved. It was manifestly better in Dadayama, particularly the first seduction scene by Ravindra Randeniya in the hotel, and horrendously out of pitch in Maruthaya, Vasantha Obeyesekeres worst movie. Our feminist film makers, for me at least, have sustained that aforementioned contradiction in nearly all their movies, which can be taken as a sign of their irrationality or indiscipline depending on how you look at them. (Which is why Obeyesekeres Palagetiyo remains the only film of his that honestly depicted the problem of eroticism versus class discrepancies). 
Its a truism that can be sustained anywhere that directors, unlike novelists, painters, and composers, tend to become more frenzied as the years pass by. This is especially true of continental directors: Tarkovsky, Bresson, Resnais, Antonioni. They hold on to their cinematic style, often adamantly (because after all they think thats the only style that matters). Sometimes this works, often it does not, which is why the later Bresson is not as great as the early Bresson and why the later Resnais is more bearable, and in some respects better, than the early Resnais. Sumitra belongs to the former category. By making her world so profoundly uncomplicated, she justifies her act of hanging on to a composed style of film making grossly out of place in an industry where careless, disjointed editing has run riot. And she succeeds. 
Within 20 years Sumitra Peries became our most accomplished editor. In the movie industry there is almost always a discrepancy between craftsmanship and imagination. Sumitra didnt fall into that discrepancy. When I talked with her not too long ago, she compared the act of editing, and even directing, to writing (what I do): There are enough and more words one can pen down, but to make them cohere well is something only a stylist can achieve. Being that stylist was never a problem for her: her challenge was to combine it with imagination. If the past 30 years is anything to go by, and considering the way she has been pigeonholed by critics, she has stood up to that challenge in a way no other technician-turned-artiste here has. 

"Elegantly composed, indulgently shot, the movies of Sumitra Peries have never been reviewed with the frame of reference they deserve. Critics have pigeon-holed her, either as a feminist film maker or as her husbands wife"

Timing of an arrest
	
Attempts by law-enforcement authorities to arrest an errant Dharma- Chakra wearing security high-up had been thwarted by a top political authority on a number of occasions.

However, the authorities biding time had gone into action the moment the top political authority who was on a visit to a foreign country took flight to return home. When he was about to be taken in, the Dharma-Chakra high-up had tried to contact the friendly political authority flying back home without success.
The fellow would be still absconding, if we failed to arrest him while his patron saint was up in the air, a senior law- enforcement officer had remarked.

Trump warns Republican Party over failure to repeal Obamacare
	

Washington, (Daily Mail), 24 July 2017 - President Donald Trump has threatened Republicans over their failure to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. 
If Republicans dont Repeal and Replace the disastrous ObamaCare, the repercussions will be far greater than any of them understand! he tweeted on Sunday. 
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, of Kentucky, is making a last-gasp effort to resuscitate the legislation after Trump insisted that senators not leave town for their August recess without passing a health bill.The process to repeal the healthcare law put into place by former President Barack Obama has proved harder than originally thought to undo. 
So far, at least three Republican senators have announced their intention to vote against a bill that would fully repeal the Affordable Care Act and a bill to repeal and replace parts of Obamacare - losing the GOP the majority they need.
