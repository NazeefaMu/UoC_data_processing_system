President hoping to become PM: Tilvin
	
President Maithripala Sirisena is hoping to become the Prime Minister under the new Constitution, JVP General Secretary Tilvin Silva claimed on Saturday.
Speaking at a function in Matale, Silva said the executive presidency will be completely removed from the new Constitution.
?The President hopes to be a candidate for the post of Prime Minister for the next elections. He is already strengthening the SLFP for this,? he said.
However, the division of the SLFP was now a problem to the President. ?Provincial Councils are the grass-roots of politics in this country. Dissolving them has caused a number of issues where services are concerned. The President is under the impression that delaying the Provincial Council elections can resolve the issues within the SLFP,? he said.
Commenting on parliamentarians being investigated, Silva said Minister of Social Empowerment and Welfare, S. B Dissanayake, has similar charges levelled against him.
?They have left him alone as he is a minister in this government. They have not taken any measures to investigate the ministers and parliamentarians connected to the government,? he said.
The General Secretary also went on to say that the ETCA with India would be detrimental to the Sri Lankan economy. ?Under this, local engineers and doctors will lose their jobs and the estate sector workers will have to work for Rs. 250 a day as the estates will be able to bring in cheaper labour from India,? he said.
Both the previous and the present government could not resolve the economic issues in the country, Silva said. (M. W. Somarathne-Matale)

TNA to take up Sampur Power Plant issues with India
	
Tamil National Alliance (TNA) chief R.Sampanthan has said that he will discuss with the Indian High Commission the ?substantial? environmental problems that will be created if India sets up a 500 MW coal-fired power plant at Sampur in Eastern Sri Lanka.
?The people of the area have been telling me about the substantial pollution and environmental damage which will be caused and have accused me of not taking any action on it. A solar powered plant in place of the coal-fired one is very much in my mind,?? he told Express on Saturday.
Lankan environmentalists quote the US-based Union of Concerned Scientists to say that a 500 MW coal fired plant will release, every year, 10,000 tons of Sulfur Dioxide (the main cause of acid rain); 10,200 tons of Nitrogen Oxide, which causes smog; 3.7 million tones of CO2, a leading cause of global warning; 500 tons of small particles which cause lung damage; 720 tons of Carbon Monoxide, which causes global warming and 2.2 billion tons of warm water, which when released into the sea will bleach corals and destroy marine life.
According to observers, India may already be thinking of setting up a solar plant at Sampur. Since the National Thermal Power Corporation, which is to set up the coal fired plant, had not been enthusiastic about the Lankan venture, others in the Indian solar energy sector may have to be tapped.
