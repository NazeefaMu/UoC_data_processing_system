A better option to treating  heart disease
	
?
Open heart surgeries have been the conventional method to treat aortic valve stenosis. Given that any heart surgery comes with a risk, the Trans-catheter Aortic Valve Implantation (TAVI) has been a preferred and effective method of treatment used in dealing with deadly heart diseases over the past few years. Dr. Chiam Toon Lim Paul, Cardiologist at Mount Elizabeth Hospital with a sub-specialization in interventional cardiology performed the first TAVI in 2009 and led the TAVI programme at the National Heart Center in Singapore. Dr. Paul also specializes in minimally invasive procedures in addition to Peripheral Artery Angioplasty and heart valve interventions.? ?
During a recent visit to Sri Lanka, Health Capsule spoke to Dr. Paul about TAVI, its benefits and the contributing factors for people to develop heart diseases.??
?
The biggest problem for heart disease is the heart artery blockage or coronary artery disease. In many of these patients with coronary artery disease, they may have suffered severe heart attacks? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?
?
What is TAVI?
Dr. Paul said that Singapore is one of the more medically advanced nations in Asia, especially in the field of cardiology where development and improvement are extremely rapid. ?So we are fortunate to have early access to new drugs and that?s what makes Singapore attractive for many patients to receive advance cardiac treatment. In recent years there are more devices and technologies which we could use to either repair the heart valve or completely replace it without the need for open-heart surgery. In the past, the only way to get to a heart valve, to repair or replace it, was through open-heart surgery. During the past 10 years we developed a few technologies to do some of these without following the open-heart procedure. This procedure called Trans-catheter Aortic Valve Intervention is where we replace the aortic valve through a small incision in the groin without the need for open heart surgery or without the need to stop the valve. We use a tissue valve that is prepared in the procedure room and it is folded down to put into a small tube which is the size of a pen. This is delivered through the hole in the groin to the heart and it replaces the heart valve. This is something that Singapore has been doing and I did it on a patient back in 2009 and we have been using it for the past few years,? said Dr. Paul.? ?
?
Benefits of using TAVI? ?
Unlike open-heart surgery, surgeons have identified several benefits in using this procedure as follows :? ?
<U+F03C> The chest need not be opened? ?
<U+F03C> The heart doesn?t need to be stopped when implanting the trans-catheter heart valve onto the beating heart? ?
<U+F03C> The native aortic valve is not removed and the newly implanted trans-catheter valve doesn?t need to be stitched in place? ?
<U+F03C> Several studies such as the PARTNER trial have shown that TAVI was better than aortic valve ballooning, which uses a balloon to widen the narrowed heart valve? ?
<U+F03C> For patients with moderate surgical risk, TAVI has also become a less invasive option? ?
Speaking further Dr. Paul said that over the nine years the valves also haven?t remained the same. ?We now use third generation valves and therefore the devices have become smaller and safer for the patients. Also the valve itself has been redesigned to improve the results of this procedure. Nowadays with the current generation valves, according to the current method in which we assess patients, the risk of replacing the heart valve is just 1-2%. The other area that Singapore is doing well is in the treatment of patients with heart failure. For many patients with heart failure there are not many options. If the heart failure is due to severe artery narrowing then we can help by doing angioplasty and adding stents to those arteries to open up the blood supply and hopefully the heart muscle recovers. Some of these patients may also need heart by-pass operations. Sometimes the damage is permanent. Even if you open the arteries the heart doesn?t recover and also there are smaller operations where the heart becomes weak due to muscle disease. This means there?s no artery blockage. With regard to these patients there are only two things we could do; one is to offer good medical treatment and in Singapore for the past four to five years we have had this new drug that has been shown to prolong survival in these kinds of conditions. The other intervention that is increasingly used for patients with severe heart failure is what we call Left Ventricular Assist device. In the old days these mechanical heart pumps were used on patients as a bridge to heart transplants. But now with improvements in technology some of these patients have had the pumps in them for many years.
Since it?s difficult to get hearts, heart transplants are very few in number. Therefore mechanical heart pumps can last for many years and become what we call a Destination Therapy. We have also observed that the quality of life is very much better with these heart pumps. This is something that isn?t found in most parts of Asia because it is heavily dependent on a good team that knows the technology and those who know how to run the devices and use the drugs,? the doctor said.?

?
Specific instances where TAVI is used? ?
TAVI is mainly used for replacement of a diseased aortic valve. According to Dr. Paul there are four valves in the heart; two on the left where one of them is the aortic valve and the other mitral valve. ?Problems in the aortic valve may be the most common problem that we see nowadays among the ageing population. So TAVI is mainly used for the aortic valve and for most patients the main problem with the aortic valve is severe aortic valve narrowing. So I would say that with the current valves we are able to do the TAVI for most of the patients with aortic valve disease.?
Therefore we cover 85-90% of the patients. There may be 10% of patients who might not survive a TAVI either because the valve is too small for any valve to fit in or it is bigger in size. The size of the valve is 18-30mm and there may be patients outside this range. This is the main reason why we cannot do TAVI on patients.?? ?
?
Contributing factors for heart diseases? ?
?The biggest problem for heart disease is the heart artery blockage or coronary artery disease,? he added. ?In many of these patients with coronary artery disease, they may have suffered severe heart attacks. If we reduce the problem of coronary heart disease then we reduce the burden of heart disease overall because it is the biggest component of all heart diseases combined. The risk factors include diabetes, smoking, cholesterol and high blood pressure. For Sri Lanka in particular and across the entire South Asian continent I think diabetes is probably the biggest contributor to heart disease because diabetes rates are quite high in this part of the world. If we can control it, we can reduce the burden of heart disease. The second reason is smoking and the third is probably cholesterol.?
All these contributing factors always return to the lifestyle. If people get some exercise and a reasonable diet, they could reduce the risk of heart disease. There are studies which show that increased red meat consumption leads to heart disease. This maybe because red meat has a lot of saturated fat. If you want to take red meat you should avoid the more fatty portions and as a whole we should reduce red meat and consume lean meat such as chicken or fish to make up for the protein that you need,?Dr. Paul said.?
?
Aftercare? ?
It is important to take good care after heart surgery. Dr. Paul said that TAVI takes about one hour.?
?The hospital stay is three nights and they can get back to their lifestyle in one or two weeks. Apart from the compulsory medications there?s nothing much they need to monitor. To control further artery blockages you need to control blood sugar etc. The valve itself is not a blood vessel. Once a valve is functioning well the patients can go back to their usual lifestyle if they don?t have diabetes and cholesterol,? he said.?

A partial Solar eclipse will occur in the 2nd quarter of Punawasa constellation in the Zodiacal sign of Gemini (Mithuna) beginning 07.16 hours (local time) on Friday July 13.
?
The greatest eclipse will occur at 08.32 hours.? It will be visible in parts of Southern Australia such as Melbourne, Stewart Island and Hobart.? ?A Solar eclipse occurs when the Moon passes between Earth and the Sun totally or partially obscuring the image of the Sun for a viewer on Earth.?
According to the ancient Indian Rishis it is inauspicious to start any important event in life or embark on any plan or program for that matter on the day of a Solar or Lunar eclipse and during the three days both preceding and following the day of the eclipse counting a total of seven days.
It is also the general opinion of the savants of Astrology that it is? inauspicious to commence any important event or plan during the running of either the Zodiacal sign or the constellation in which the eclipse occurs either on the day of the eclipse or within the seven days preceding or the following the day of the eclipse which add up to 15 days.?

Appoint PCoI to probe NYT allegations: UNP
	
UNP backbench MPs today called for the setting up of a Presidential Commission of Inquiry (PCoI) to probe the allegations which had been made in the news report published by the New York Times.
The request for the PCoI was made by UNP MP Mujibur Rahman at a news briefing held at parliamentary complex this morning.
Asked whether the request was his personal one, Mr. Rahman said it was his personal one but UNP is also of the opinion that the allegations made in the New York Times report should be probed.
?I am expressing my own opinion but my party is also of the opinion that the allegations has to be probed,? the MP said. (Yohan Perera and Ajith Siriwardana)

Bring back LTTE! -Want a Hitler ? But, Don?t ?Shoot the Messenger?
	
Understanding Ven. Upali Thero and Minister Wijayakala
The act of blaming the bearer of bad news or getting rid of the courier may be a strategic move
	She thrashed President Sirisena for not helping to solve the problem faced by the Tamils of the North
	Men and women who ruled this country over the last 70 years and still continue to do so by arousing ethnic hatred are responsible
	She could have done it diplomatically for once if she was educated; stress, tension and emotions are not an excuse
?
In the South they want a Hitler and Notherners want LTTE back! If this goes like this both will surely get leaders they deserve. The truth is that a large majority does not want Hitlers or Prabhakarans back. Both Ven. Upali Thero and Minister Wijeyakala have conveyed a message; an invaluable one homogenious with people?s notification to ?yahapalanaya? made on February 10. It is a figure of speech, a metaphor, that openly refers to one thing by revealing another for rhetorical outcome.
Sophocles says in Antigone;?No one loves the messenger who brings bad news??
As reported a week ago, at Gotabhaya Rajapaksa?s residence the Anunayaka Thero of the Asgiri Chapter, Venerable Wedaruwe Upali Thera addressing Gota has said, ?Some people have described you as a Hitler,? he had said before adding: ?Be a Hitler. Go with the military and take the leadership of this country,? a ?sermon? that has been described as ?most treacherous and a morally deteriorating public statement.? The messengers know that a vast section of people feel that the government is fragile and indecisive; uncertain of its future.? ?
?The act of blaming the bearer of bad news or getting rid of the courier may be a strategic move. As reported in the Daily Mirror the lady member Maheswaran has said, ?It is seen that there is a huge need of reorganization of the LTTE in the North and East?, State Minister of Child Affairs claimed today addressing the ?Janapathi Nila Mehewara.?? ?
?She has flayed the government heads at the occasion held at the Weerasingham Hall in Jaffna in the presence of two cabinet ministers. ?A lot of Northern women face grave difficulties now. A six-year-old girl was killed recently in Jaffna. If the LTTE had been around still with us this would not have happened,? she said. Metaphor know how to serve as a tool for convincing a gathering with the speaker?s point of view or opinion, the so-called symbolic metaphor.?
?
Wijayakala, the widow of slain Thiyagarajah Maheswaran MP, former Hindu Affairs Minister, emphasised on the need for restructuring of the LTTE -?Our main intention is to bring back the LTTE if we want to live, if we want to walk freely, if we need our children to attend schools...?? ?
She thrashed President Sirisena for not helping to solve the problem faced by the Tamils of the North. ?He is only concerned about strengthening his party. He doesn?t try to solve the issues of the Northerners. He has failed to save the Tamil people,? the State Minister has said.? ?
However, Wijeyakala has brought temporary relief to perpetrators of New York Times reported, Chinese company?s contribution of US$ 7.6 mn to the then President Mahinda Rajapaksa?s presidential election campaign and the bond scams probe findings on Aloysius? Mendis arrack-cheques to undisclosed 118 as per alleged missing Anexture-2; and all the evils of bribery and corruption old and new.
?The recent reports relating to traces of LTTE reorganizing that are heard regularly, is the result of the people in the North and the East not willing to discard the LTTE from their hearts.? ?
Amongst reconciliation of various ethnic groups and peaceful co-existence, if politicians talk about bringing back LTTE, where will the gracious concept of peaceful co-existence head. These men and women who ruled this country over the last 70 years and still continue to do so by arousing ethnic hatred are responsible.? ?
?Political Opportunists, nationalists and other racist elements and the rest will go to town with this, justifying what they have said about the resurrection of LTTE. It is distressing to find a politician affiliated to the government uttering this type of thing which generates fear in the minds of people.? ?
With the two leaders who are not only at loggerheads on contentious issues, but look for the slightest chance to vilify and belittle the other?one doing it openly while the other covertly using subordinates, the country is heading for anarchy. Constitutional reforms for power devolution has taken a permanent back seat creating restlessness and agitations by the Tamil youth compelling Wijeyakalas to utter such dangerous statements. Corruption and waste are rampant. Despite allegations of dishonesty, fraud, authoritarian trends practised during their regime Rajapaksas are gaining popularity gradually and steadily.TNA Parliamentarian Dharmalingam Siddharthan speaking to Daily Mirror about politics in the North and the presidential elections, interviewed by Kelum Bandara a few days before said,?Tamils are opposed to Gota in general as a possible candidate; Yet, there are some Tamils who admire him as a doer.? People in the North or South admire doers, not talkers.? ?
?The recent discoveries by security units suggest that there are obvious signs of resentment among youth in the north. The Chief Minister and a few councillors are campaigning for winning them to their side. Wijeyakala perhaps is the latest addition to the list. The government must work closely with the moderate TNA in handling the situation before things get out of hand.? ?
The 30-year war has tattered the social fabric. People in the North have grievances and the truth is that the government has failed in instituting law and order in the country and freeing it from the criminals. People will not appreciate the good work as long as they suffer economic hardships. But comparing with a ruthless terrorist group hell bent on devastation or calling for restoration of such a faction is detrimental. The spirit of her words is the pressing need for the implementation of a proper law and order situation in the North. What she implies is action against rape, murder, burglary that was unheard of during the period of the LTTE. Reading between the lines she was not demanding a separate state nor an armed organization to fight the state.? ?
A few extremists living in Sri Lanka and a good majority living overseas, the Diaspora, who harbour grudges with the armed forces and some factions of people in the South, would like to see the emergence of the LTTE. The north is a beautiful place today with people living in peace and harmony. Wijayakala?s speech and the Anunayake Thero?s words have to be taken in the correct perspective. Today all Sri Lankans, in the North, South, East and West are worried about the deteriorating law and order situation in the country. Children are being kidnapped, raped, and murdered at a rate all over the island. The people who are answerable for maintaining law and order are in their long slumber. Quite naturally, when a six-year-old girl was raped and killed and a 59-year old woman cut with a sharp weapon, raped in front of her bed-ridden husband, people in Jaffna or any part of the land would feel the same.? ?
?We do not know what development they have done in our area. But I only thank the Government for one good thing and that is to release and return our lands to us. Other than that the Government has done nothing for us,? Wijeyakala said. Some say she should be straight away stripped of her job and be prosecuted under the supreme law of the nation for promoting a terrorist group. Wijeyakala has to be understood with the correct perception. She could have done it diplomatically for once if she was educated; stress, tension and emotions are not an excuse. She was adding fuel to the fire. Surely she witnessed what this small island went through during the gruesome war. Bring back the LTTE for recruiting hundreds of child soldiers, and force them to pick up arms?? ?
She should not be sacked and charged for sedition, pardon her, let her regret and change her stance. What she spoke about could happen in the south as well. It is quite possible that a small percentage of youth in the north and the east are not prepared to abandon the LTTE from their hearts. Whether we like it or not this is the truth. All Sri Lankans are concerned about the fast deteriorating law and order situation in the country.? ?
The State Minister spoke to resurrect the banned terrorist outfit in front of two senior ministers of the government. If the government thinks of just stopping Rajapaksa supporters or Maheswaran type rhetoric with their back-benchers balderdash, before long people will speak at elections.? ?
She in fact repeated what the Thera told Gota; to rule the country like Hitler and discipline the people. Perhaps they want LTTE and a Hitler to punish the wrong doers in a Kangaroo Court?? ?

Debt trap a fabrication of the West: Chinese Embassy
	
In the wake of New York Times reports on Chinese loans to Sri Lanka, the Chinese embassy said yesterday the so-called "Debt Trap" is a false proposition created by the Western media in a direct attempt to obstruct the joint development of China and other developing countries including Sri Lanka.
Addressing a news conference, Embassy spokesperson Luo Chong said the fundamental purpose of making such allegation was to maintain the western world's "traditional" superior position in the international and regional politics and economics.
He said China would continue to provide ?selfless support? including much-needed funds for the development of Sri Lanka, and would like to work together with the Sri Lankan government, business community, media and the general public to eliminate interference, strengthen confidence, and jointly promote the pragmatic cooperation for the benefit of the two countries and the two peoples.
?Chinese loans are not the main part of Sri Lanka's foreign debt. According to the Annual Report 2017 of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka, the total external debt of the country amounted to US $ 51.824 billion. Of it, the outstanding Chinese loans accounted for 10.6% or US $ 5.5 billion. Besides, 61.5% the Chinese loans (USD 3.38 billion) are concessional ones with a much lower interest rate than the international market rates. The commercial loans from China were also negotiated at an appropriate rate by the two sides according to the then international market,? he said.
Mr. Luo said the transfer of operation of the port to the Chinese side was also proposed by the Sri Lankan government only, and it was finally agreed after rounds of ?friendly and equal? commercial negotiations.
?The purpose was to fully exploit the geographical advantages of Hambantota, improve operational efficiency and revitalize good assets, so as to further develop the port economy of Sri Lanka. At present, the port business is operated by Sino-Sri Lankan joint ventures, the port revenue is shared by both sides, and the port security is entirely under the responsibility of the Sri Lankan government,? he said.

Raphael Varane's glancing header and a goalkeeping blunder that gifted Antoine Griezmann a soft goal gave France a 2-0 victory over Uruguay in the first World Cup 2018 quarter-final.
Uruguay goalkeeper Fernando Muslera had no real chance of stopping Varane?s first-half header, but his massive error on Antoine Griezmann?s second-half laser ended all hope for a team already down one of its two true scoring threats in Edinson Cavani.
As a result, France advanced to the World Cup semifinals for the first time since its run to final in 2006. Les Bleus will face either Brazil or Belgium on Tuesday in St. Petersburg.

From IRDP to Gamperaliya The one big lie Why rural development programmes always fail
	
We have had very healthy debates in the past and ended up late in the day in high spirits. We?ve wrestled with very many issues often with disagreements and learnt more than we thought we knew.
I cannot count even half-a-dozen politicians, who could sit through such long debates like you with patience and with interest.
I have that rare privilege of a gift from you, the book Dreams from My Father authored by Barak Obama- a result of one of those long-debates we had in May 2008.
Who would win the US Democratic Party Primaries and why? I stood with Obama. I do not know of a politician who walks into a bookshop in an airport to buy a book to be gifted in appreciation of a serious discussion he or she was involved in.
I believe you are still that. Yet, this is not for you Mangala, but for the Hon. Minister of Finance.
Today, the context is different from then. Today, I?m openly engaging with you on your popular campaign Gamperaliya for rural development.
As you know, I have had no formal education in the subject area of Economics. But I believe you are quite aware that I am also no fan of this Neoliberal Market Economy.
I have often argued that free market economies breed majoritarian extremism as a political necessity, are inherently corrupt and are exclusive ?city centred? leaving out rural societies.
I, therefore, dig up a thing that relates to Rural Development in these free market economies and that was my interest in your much-hyped Gamperaliya Programme.
I Love that label of the programme, but not the programme as it is. Reading through media reports and your speeches I understand it has two segments running concurrently. One named Enterprise Sri Lanka and the other linked up with President Sirisena?s Grama Shakthi.
Such duplicity in development programmes also proves there is no seriousness in the actual development of rural society.
The Enterprise part of Gamperaliya is said to work towards having 100,000 entrepreneurs by 2020, which is when the UNP expects to run its own Presidential Candidate after skipping the two previous elections.
The strategy in creating those entrepreneurs is to offer 15 loan schemes under three categories to the business sector and rural society from agrarian based loans to women and youth.
It is common knowledge that selections for such State Patronage at the local level would be very much politically influenced and would remain so.
While it is said, State Banks would have a special PR desk to handle these loans, there is no mention of how ?use of these loans? would be regularly monitored and supported, when necessary.
Am I to presume therefore the year ahead would be when a 100, 000 families would be doled out money as ?loans for business? before the expected 2020 Presidential Election?
The State would be left responsible for a substantial part of payback as you have said at the launch of Enterprise Sri Lanka.
The other segment of Gamperaliya that would be carried out with President Sirisena?s? Grama Shakthi is to focus on village infrastructure; development of water tanks, anicuts, green parks, free Wi-Fi, rehabilitation of small religious places, village roads and the like.
Your Gamperaliya is not about improving the quality of rural life but is about pumping money into rural society to help catch votes
It was also reported, the Moneragala District, from where the Gamperaliya began five days ago, was allocated Rs. 500 million for the construction of 25,000 toilets for families without such facility.
I doubt anyone has actually done a field survey to enumerate these numbers. If there had been any, could details of ?would be recipients? be made public, before the money was doled out?
I bet it would not be done at any time and am I to believe this would also be another dole of Rs.20, 000 for each of these families before 2020 Presidential Elections?
Mr Minister, as you and I know quite well, these recipient numbers are almost always made up for very narrow politics of individuals.
You and I know that right down to the GS Niladhari, the whole district administration, as a rule, is corrupt, inefficient, lethargic and heavily politicised.
That said, can I ask you, how different is this total programme for all previous efforts made in developing rural life?
With the opening up of the economy without any restrictions on import and export trade, the first planned effort in rural development was through Integrated Rural Development Projects, the first, launched in 1978 in the Kurunegala District.
Thereafter, for over two decades, IRDPs were carried out in most Districts other than in the Western, Northern and Eastern Provinces.
All of them ran into double phases with at least eight consecutive years. They were all foreign assisted, with NORAD providing most funding.
And they included almost all that you have in your Gamperaliya Development Programme. Yet, all IRDPs were complete failures.
IRDPs not making any impact on poor rural life, more and more young rural women were seeking migrant employment as housemaids in the Middle East for a pittance.
Thus around 1998, IRDP was turned into Rural Enterprise Advancement Programme (REAP) that focussed on business efforts of rural society, not very different to your loan schemes for ?entrepreneurs?.
REAP folded up with two district programmes; the first being in Matale. Designed and planned in Colombo and implemented through district State Administration, they all proved total failures.
I would suggest that you read a very comprehensive study on Sri Lanka?s IRDPs done by Norwegian ?Specialist? Reidar Dale, titled Organization of Regional Development Work published by Sarvodaya to familiarise yourself about issues on the ground and for some good reasons as to why they should not be done the way you have programmed.
Apart from Governments, there are many NGOs with foreign funds including ONUR that focus on livelihood development of rural societies.
For many decades they have organised microcredit programmes that mainly focused on women and youth, a social segment you have also stressed upon.
Most such NGOs have used ILO sponsored SIYB and GIZ (then GTZ) designed CEFE, two training programmes to develop rural entrepreneurship, with grants attached.
I believe these programmes would have trained many thousand micros and small business leaders in rural societies over the past many decades.
But hardly any had prospered to live profitably after funded projects concluded.
Proof of failure is the launch of direct poverty alleviation Programmes: Janasaviya, Samurdhi and now your Gamperaliya with Grama Shakthi, implemented to address decades-old issues with the same old approach and answers.
The fault is in how Rural Development is being understood and in how it is being approached within this free-market economy.
Mr Minister, to understand Rural Development one has to first define what Development at a holistic level is. Development is not just a growing economy.
That is how this Free market economy, with Neoliberal jargon, interprets development in an insanely competitive market economy.
But Development is all about improving the quality of life. Quality of life is not ONLY about money and income.
It is about earning enough income within 07 or 08 hours a day in a 05-day working week, to spend not only on adequate daily consumption, services and for saving, but also have a wallet that would allow recreation and cultural life both for his or her family and for him or herself.
This was not what was talked about as development since 1978 when IRDP/REAP were designed, planned and implemented. It isn?t even now.
Rural development needs planners who can speak the same language as villagers do, know the taste of what they eat, have sat through the night in a rural hospital without a bed and no medical doctor visiting, felt the heat of the sun and seen how they toil for a pittance.
What is also not being paid attention to is the fact that paddy cultivation, which is more cultural than economic, leaves a large percentage of rural agri-labour under-utilised for over six months of the year, with Maha Season being the most extensive paddy cultivation season of about four-months duration.
This under-utilised labour can only struggle through life. It is worse when most essential and efficient services the State is held responsible for, formal education, preventive health and hospital facilities, public commuting and cheap energy sources, apart from cultural and recreational facilities were totally absent in all rural development programmes and is no different in Gamperaliya as well.
How can there be a prosperous revolt in the village without any of them being given priority?
Sadly, your Gamperaliya too is not about improving the quality of rural life but is about pumping money into rural society, a political gimmick every Government politician think could help catch votes.
Forty years within this free market economy, whatever money pumped into rural society, has ended up getting accrued in the most economically patronised Colombo City. That Mr Minister needs serious changes to your Gamperaliya programme and in the free market economy too.
Wish you have the courage to initiate such radical change.

## Title: Indo-Pacific Command a threat to peace in Indian Ocean

Indo-Pacific Command a threat to peace in Indian Ocean
	
On May 31st this year, at a solemn ceremony in Hawaii, the United States military renamed its Pacific Command as the ?Indo-Pacific Command?. The move, though significant in many respects, has not generated as much debate as it should have in the South Asian region.?
In a tweet to mark the occasion, the US embassy in New Delhi said: ?In symbolic nod to India, United States renamed its @PacificCommand the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command. Looking forward to higher levels of #USIndiaDefence cooperation.?
This week, testifying before the United States Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Alaina Teplitz, the ambassador-nominee for Sri Lanka and the Maldives, said the two island nations were important for the wider security and prosperity of the Indo-Pacific region.?
She noted that both Sri Lanka and the Maldives are positioned astride key shipping lanes that connect the Straits of Hormuz and Malacca, the free navigation of which is vital to US economic and security interests.? Teplitz said Washington must also be mindful of the economic and commercial opportunities each country afforded, and the importance of working with them to maintain a rules-based international order.
The mentioning of the Indo-Pacific region in her testimony was deliberate.? It was an attempt to further popularize or formalise the term ?Indo-Pacific?, while her call for a rules-based international order is a direct swipe at China, which is being accused by the US and its Asian allies of wrongfully claiming sovereignty over disputed islands in the South China Sea and of building artificial islands for military use in violation of international law.?
The Donald Trump administration, which is seen to be opposing everything that was Barack Obama, has fully embraced the term Indo-Pacific, which the Obama administration showed some reluctance to formalise.??
After a meeting between India?s Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Trump in the White House in June last year, a joint communiqu? described the two leaders as ?stewards? for the peace and stability of the Indo-Pacific region. During Trump?s East Asia tour in November last year, the term ?Indo-Pacific? figured so liberally in statements that it exposed hurried and deliberate efforts? to win recognition for the new region.? That the term is also being liberally used in political discourses in Japan is no coincidence. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is a key architect of the concept.
Last month, addressing the Shangri La Dialogue conference in Singapore, Modi defined the Indo-Pacific region as ?a natural region? that stretches from the east coast of Africa to the west coast of America.? While emphasising that India?s acceptance of the Indo-Pacific region was not directed against any nation, he said the building of a ?stable, secure and prosperous Indo-Pacific region? was an ?important pillar? of India?s partnership with the US.
With the formal announcement of the Indo-Pacific command, the Indian Ocean region is set to become a militarised zone where the big powers will flex their military muscles sooner than later. The new command together with the US Central Command (for Middle East), the African Command and the European Command provides around-the-world connectivity to the US military.?
The Indo-Pacific Command is a blow to the Indian Ocean peace zone concept.? In the 1970s, Sri Lanka had been in the forefront of global efforts to declare the Indian Ocean as a peace zone and had opposed superpower military presence in the region. Although the Soviet Union was supportive of the Sri Lankan initiative, the US, which had a major military base in the Indian Ocean island of Diego Garcia, ignored Colombo?s call, which was then fully backed by the Non-Aligned Movement.?
It is significant to note that India has veered away from its ?middle-path? foreign policy and has cooperated with the US in the renaming of the Pacific Command, in keeping with its redefined geostrategic objective of containing a rising China, with whom it has several territorial disputes, the latest being last year?s Doklam crisis on the Bhutan border.? India?s new policy is a major shift from its Indira doctrine which was designed to keep the US out of the seas surrounding India. In keeping with the doctrine ? named after Prime Minister Indira Gandhi ? India policed and dominated the South Asian part of the Indian Ocean.? Now a combined Indo-US effort will go into the policing of this part of Indian Ocean, where concerns have been raised by India over China?s increasing naval movements including the sighting of nuclear submarines.
The move further consolidates the US strategy of making India the lynchpin in containing China ? and India, it appears, cherishes the importance the US gives it. India is now, to all intents and purposes, part of the United States? Asia Nexus. The partnership takes their defence ties to the next level, two years after they signed a logistics defence pact to allow the militaries of both countries to use each other?s assets and bases for repair and replenishment of supplies.
Besides, India is a key member of a tri-nation defence arrangement, also involving the US and Japan. The three countries conduct annual military exercises on a mega scale.? Called ?Malabar?, this year?s exercise, which took place, significantly, a week after the ?Indo-Pacific Command? renaming ceremony, was held in the seas off the Pacific Island of Guam where the US maintains its biggest offshore military base. Also part of this arrangement was Australia. However, of late, Canberra has scaled down its involvement, perhaps in deference to its growing trade and investment ties with China.
In international relations, alliances are important because power is also assessed on the basis of the military alliances a nation makes.? However much China catches up with the US in terms of economic power, military parity and advancement in science and technology, it still lags behind in making military alliances with strategically important nations.? This is why it remains edged out in the contest for the Indo-Pacific region.? Despite growing economic ties with China, most ASEAN countries view China with suspicion and will not abandon the US military protection.??
The only South Asian country which China can consider as a strategic ally is Pakistan, although Islamabad also maintains close military relations with Washington.? Countries like Sri Lanka, Nepal and the Maldives in South Asia, on the one hand, are much in need of China?s development aid and investments, and, on the other, are wary of getting caught in the cold war between China and the Indo-US military alliance. It is diplomatic tightrope walking for these countries.? ?China sees the formalisation of the Indo-Pacific Command as part of the US strategy to instigate China and India into a long-term conflict. The Global Times, China?s official English language mouthpiece, sees India as having fallen into a US trap aimed at strengthening Washington?s control of the Indian Ocean.?
The Indo-Pacific military command appears to be bellicose and therefore Indian Ocean nations should be wary of the consequences.? The Indian Ocean littoral states ? members of the Indian Ocean Rim Association for Regional Cooperation ? need to meet soon to discuss moves to stop the militarisation of the Indian Ocean. India owes these nations a commitment that it will not allow its Indo-Pacific partnership with the US to threaten the peace of the Indian Ocean.?

## Title: Lethal side of snoring

Lethal side of snoring
	
?
Snoring is a very common phenomenon in our society that most of the time we tend to ignore it or to laugh it off. But did you know that there is a disease which is associated with snoring which can cause serious problems to your health, going so far as to endanger your life at some instances? We consulted Dr. Bodhika Samarasekera, Consultant Respiratory Physician, District General Hospital Hambantota, and Joint secretary, Sri Lanka College of Pulmonologists, to obtain more information on this condition, which is called Obstructive Sleep Apnoea.??
?
Snoring??
Snoring is the harsh sound that you hear when air flows through the partially relaxed tissues of your throat during sleep, explained Dr. Samarasekera. ?As you progress from light sleep to deep sleep, the tissues (muscles) of the roof of your mouth, tongue and throat relax and partially block your airway. There will be a vibration when air flows through these relaxed tissues which, in turn, will generate a sound, which is called snoring? he said.??
?
Men are more likely to snore or be diagnosed with obstructive sleep apnoea than women. In addition, alcohol consumption and smoking are also found to be risk factors. Amongst these, particulary alcohol relaxes the smooth muscles of the throat and increase the risk of snoring?
?
Obstructive Sleep Apnoea??
?When snoring reaches a level that is harmful to your health, it is classified as a sleep disorder, called Obstructive Sleep Apnoea (OSA). ?When the airway narrowing during sleep becomes very severe as you breathe in, it will cause inadequate breathing for 10 to 20 seconds. Imagine a water pipe that has been narrowed from the inside, which will cause obstruction to the flow of water. Similarly, airway narrowing or obstruction during sleep will compromise air flow and oxygen supply.? ?
This process will cause the lowering of oxygen level in your blood and increase the carbon dioxide. The brain, sensing this, will briefly rouse you from sleep in order to reopen your airways. This awakening is very brief and you may make a choking or gasping sound. However you won?t be able to remember it? Dr. Samarasekera said.? ?
?
Dangers of OSA??
Sleep is a vital requirement in a person?s life. As most of us have experienced, the quality of sleep that we get at night will affect our level of functioning during day time.??
?As explained earlier, frequently being woken up due to OSA impairs your ability to reach the desired deep, restful phases of sleep. Hence your will feel sleepy during the day time, decreasing your working capacity. Research has found that people suffering from OSA are more likely to get into road traffic accidents while driving. Even more dangerous is the fact that sufferers of OSA actually don?t know that they are sleep deprived, assuming that they have received a full night?s sleep, making them less cautious? he added.??
?In addition to this, Obstructive sleep apnoea can also lead to several medical problems such as Hypertension, Ischemic heart disease and stroke as well.? ?
?
There are many cardiovascular complications that can occur due to episodic lowering of oxygen levels and cardiac strain during obstructive sleep apnoea episodes
?
Risk Factors??
?Obesity is one of the major risk factor for obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) in our country as well as in other parts of the world. More than half of OSA patients are overweight and fat deposition in upper airway may cause this problem. However it is very important to remember that all patients suffering from obstructive sleep apnoea are not overweight and thin people can also have this problem.??
Men are more likely to snore or be diagnosed with obstructive sleep apnoea than women. In addition alcohol consumption and smoking are also found to be risk factors. Amongst these, particularly alcohol relaxes the smooth muscles of the throat and increases the risk of snoring? he said.??
People who have large tonsils or adenoids;(glands on either side of the tonsils) and longer soft palate are at high risk of snoring that leads to obstructive sleep apnoea.? ?
?
Symptoms of obstructive sleep apnoea??
Loud snoring is the key symptom of obstructive sleep apnoea and there will be abrupt awakenings that are accompanied by gasping and choking. The partner may have observed breathing cessation episodes associated with snoring, where the partner stops breathing altogether for a few seconds, after which he resumes breathing.??
??Snoring due to obstructive sleep apnoea is usually loudest when you sleep on your back and it quiets when you turn on your side.??
Episodic airflow obstructions lead to reduce oxygen supply to the brain and the other organs. Hence they have poor quality sleep with abrupt awakenings and often complain of daytime sleepiness, drowsiness and morning headaches. Hence they may have poor performances at their jobs and at school. Moreover, they might experience a drop in interest where sexual relationships are concerned. This may cause marital disharmony in addition to the sleep disturbance of the partner? Dr. Samarasekera added.??
?Day time drowsiness and sleepiness caused by obstructive sleep apnoea is one of the major causes for road traffic accidents and industrial accidents in most part of the world including Sri Lanka.??
?
Complications of obstructive sleep apnoea??
Obstructive sleep apnoea can cause serious medical and social problems, especially if you fail to diagnose and treat it at the correct time.??
There are many cardiovascular complications that can occur due to episodic lowering of oxygen levels and cardiac strain during obstructive sleep apnoea episodes. Hence severe obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) can be complicated with hypertension, heart attack, heart failure and stroke. Furthermore, they may also have an increased risk of abnormal cardiac rhythms (arrhythmias).??
?One of the major complications due to daytime drowsiness is road traffic accidents that can cause lots of problems to yourself and the society. In addition, poor work performances and a sleep deprived partner lead to many social problems.??
People with obstructive sleep apnoea are more prone to experience complications following major surgery. They develop breathing problems after being sedated and lying on their back. Hence it is very important to inform your doctor if you have obstructive sleep apnoea or symptoms suggestive of obstructive sleep apnoea before you undergo surgery? he said.? ?
Let?s talk more about diagnosing and treating Obstructive Sleep Apnoea in the next article.??

While stating that Finance and Mass Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera should not be panicked over the law suits which would be filed against the media which are misinterpreting the facts, the Joint Opposition yesterday said instead Minister Samaraweera should be anxious over the statements made by the government ministers calling for the resurgence of the LTTE.
While referring to the controversial NY Times report, which alleged that a Chinese company had funded the campaign of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa in January 2015, JO group member MP Namal Rajapaksa said standing for the accuracy and filing a lawsuit would not be amounted to suppression of media.
He also said the joint opposition would work forward to establish a government with more media freedom with the leadership of former President Rajapaksa in near future.
?The government is in an attempt to conceal the bond scam through this NY Times report. A report has revealed that the US has funded US$ 585 million for three countries including Sri Lanka, Myanmar and Nigeria to establish peace. The government should investigate these facts also,? he said.
?We vehemently condemn the statement made by State Minister Vijayakala Maheswaran calling for the resurgence of the LTTE. There is no use of conducting disciplinary investigations. We are waiting for President Maithripala Sirisena to take legal actions against the State Minister,? he added. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)

NLB on track to make lottery history
	
With sales of over 3500 tickets every minute, rising business volumes and a vast network, NLB is soaring to new heights.?
The National Lotteries Board (NLB) ? under the? stewardship of the Board of Directors led by its Chairperson Shyamila Perera ? is hoping for a record performance. The NLB anticipates annual revenues of Rs.21 billion this year, & if they succeed? will be the highest in Sri Lanka?s lottery history.?
Ms. Perera said that if everything goes well, they expect to reach this target by December. She noted that getting there will involve constant sales activity. ?Ours is a 24x7 operation, with over 3500 tickets sold every minute and four lotteries drawn every day,? she said.? The figure for the whole of 2017 was Rs. 16.7 billion and Rs.20.1 billion the year before.?
With nine lotteries in its portfolio and high prize structures, NLB is? looking towards increasing business volumes. And in the process, they are producing many multi millionaires. In fact, during the last four years, they have produced 160 multi millionaires .
The recently launched Dhana Nidhanaya offers Sri Lanka?s largest starting super prize ? Rs.80 million. Mega Power has seen its starting super prize of Rs. 50 million soar to over Rs. 150 milliontoday. And the Govisetha super prize, which started at Rs. 60 million, is now worth above Rs.100 million. In fact, NLB produced a record 13 multi millionaires during the first five months of this year. In the same period, there were more than 70 million winners overall, and they won over 3.8 billion worth of cash prizes.
According to Ms. Perera, every day, on average, there are over 550,000 winners; they collectively win more than Rs. 25 million. The revenue earnings by NLB per day is around Rs. 600 million on average.? ?
NLB is among the highest contributors of revenue to the state coffers. In fact, they contributed over Rs. 960 million to the government during the first five months of this year alone. And for the four years from 2014 to 2017, they contributed Rs. 8.4 billion to the government.??
NLB has seen impressive growth since the new administration took over? and Ms. Perera as the Chairperson in early 2015. In 2015, NLB recorded a profit of Rs. 241 million. A recovery from an Rs.8mn loss in the previous year. In three years since, they achieved a profit of nearly Rs. 414 million. Revenue, which stood at Rs. 17.1 billion in 2015, achieved? Rs. 20.1 bn revenue? in 2016 and? is expected to exceed Rs.20 billion this year.??
?We are a state-owned business organization assigned with generating funds for the government,? says Ms. Perera, ?Our intention is to be the model business organization in the government sector.?? ?
She believes that NLB can achieve even greater success if they weren?t hampered by the various government procedures and regulations state-owned entities are subjected to.? She says that having to comply with administrative circulars and other forms of red tape that limits efficiency.?
?We understand? and believe in the need for transparency, for a system of checks and balances and all that, but these regulations can be time consuming and quite stifling,? Ms. Perera points out. She notes, for instance, that they require the approval of designated authorities for recruitment, this results in undue delays. ?Such things keep us from being the robust, dynamic organization we would like to be,? she adds.
She hopes the government will alter such restrictions that limit their ability to function as a business-oriented organization. ?We need more flexibility, for example, to restructure the workforce for greater productivity,? she says.?
Ms. Perera has made representations to the higher authorities, including the minister in charge, and is optimistic that things will change. She is confident that this will enable NLB to reveal its true potential. Even at present, the NLB, with just 400 employees, contributes far more to government revenue than? most of other state-owned entities with workforces many times that size and in Grade A category but dependent on the treasury.? .? ?
NLB can draw on its long heritage and experience to reach even higher. In fact, they have the pioneering lottery brand ? Mahajana Sampatha ? which was launched in 1970. In 2016, NLB underwent a significant transformation with a new corporate identity and logo.? Today, with a market share of 55-60% of total tickets sold, it is the largest lottery organization in Sri Lanka.? ? ? ?
At present, NLB has 400 employees and a vast network of 12,500 ticket sellers, 2800 agents and 108 district dealers covering all regions. It has expanded its presence in the north and east. Currently, 2-3% of NLB?s revenue comes from these areas, and higher growth is anticipated in the future. In fact, the Jaffna District has consistently exceeded their sales targets.?
NLB is also engaged in corporate social responsibility. Through their dedicated CSR brand Neeroga they have, since July 2015, contributed Rs.137 million to the National Kidney Fund. With a CSR budget of nearly Rs.100 million annually, they are also involved in various sponsorships and other initiatives such as constructing water purification plants.
As part of a new initiative to go digital, NLB recently introduced an SMS-based system, which has so far attracted over 20,000 active users. Ms. Perera said they are now in the process of discussing proposals by app developers and other digital solution providers to introduce Web and smartphone-based systems as well. She however stated that they have to take into account the concerns of their stake holders the sales net work? who fear their livelihoods will be affected. ?I think it?s best to get them directly involved in such initiatives by offering them incentives and user-friendly apps? and awareness to conduct business,? she added.?

?None recorded PTL, Mendis transactions may be linked to given cheques?
	
According to an interim report of the CBSL it was revealed that there were unusual secondary market transactions between Perpetual Treasuries Ltd (PTL) and WM Mendis & Company which were not recorded in the CBSL system.
ASG Yasantha Kodagoda said those suspicious transactions may be linked with cash cheques dispersed to various outside parties by PTL as the PTL?s transfer of money to WM Mendis & Company did not have a commercial value.
At the onset of the inquiry, complying with the previous court order, Chairman of the Perpetual Treasuries Ltd, Geoffrey Aloysius appeared in Court. He also tendered the asset statements of the PTL in Court as required previously.
However, it was explained that Mr, Geoffrey Aloysius will not represent PTL in the inquiry and therefore there will be no representation for the company which is the third suspect in the inquiry.
Additional Solicitor General Yasantha Kodagoda who appeared for the Prosecution thoroughly explained about a set of transactions that had taken place between PTL and WM Mendis & Companies (PTL's related group company) which were found as unusual secondary market transactions in an interim report given to the prosecution by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka.
The Central Bank is currently investigating on the money trading allegation against PTL with its related group companies, where it was alleged that PTL had dispersed cash cheques to the outside parties through its other related companies.
The interim report was relating to the above investigation of the CBSL as it had included an important finding during the investigation.
ASG Kodagoda, explaining the interim report's finding, elaborated the manner in which these alleged transactions had taken place.
He said there were particular transactions had taken place between PTL and WM Mendis & Companies which operated as PTL's secondary market Treasuries Bond transactions.
Explaining on the unusual nature of those transactions, the ASG pointed out that there were five categories namely REPO, REVERSE REPO, REPO ROLLOVER, REVERSE REPO ROLLOVER and OUGHT RIGHT secondary market transactions with WM Mendis & Companies between January 2015 to September 2016.
He said the transactions in such nature should be separately recorded in the RTGS and CDS computer systems in the CBSL contemporaneously in addition to the physical documents maintained by PTL on those transactions.
He said PTL had transferred considerable amount of money (sometimes Rs. 2 million per day) to the WM Mendis & companies as profits at the end of these bilateral transactions, which has no record in CBSL. (Shehan Chamika Silva)

Read Your character by your Natal Solar Month
	
The Lagna in Astrological nomenclature is a very familiar term to all of us. And most of know that the Lagna is one of the twelve signs of the Zodiac beginning with Aries (Mesha) which happens to rise from the horizon at the time of one?s birth. Metaphorically speaking the Lagna thus determined is the foundation on which one?s Natal Chart is built.
?
Lagna, portrayal of character
Much significance is attached to the Lagna of a person, because the Lagna serves as a portrayal of a person?s characteristics and the course of his life in store. In fact, the Lagna is so important that the influences of planets on a person are modified- either reduced or intensified ? depending on the Lagna.?
?
Natal Solar Month in Western Astrology
However, some Western astrologers and numerologists, adopt a different method in ascribing the signs of the Zodiac to people to delineating their characteristics and making predictions.? They go by the Solar month in which a person is born rather than the sign which rises from the horizon at the time of birth.
?
Solar calendar
We hope that the readers know that there is a solar calendar as distinct from Gregorian calendar.? According to the solar calendar, the 12 signs of the Zodiac are assigned to the 12 months.? The Solar year begins with Aries (Mesha) and ends with Pisces (Meena).? For us in Sri Lanka, the Solar month Aries begins when the Sun enters the Aries sign about 13 or 14 April of the year. (The exact duration of the Sun?s transit in each sign can be verified with the aid of an ephemeris for the year.) The Sun remains in this sign till about May 14.?
Western astrologers and numerologists treat all persons born within the period the Sun transits in the Aries sign as Aries people.?
The Solar calendar for the year 2018/2019 is given below for the convenience of our readers.

Removing barriers for LGBT + people in  Sri Lanka
	
The Colombo Pride month supporting Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Intersex and Questioning (LGBTIQ) rights, culture, and community ended last week. Celebrations wrapped up for this year, offices closed and volunteers returned home. In spite of annual celebrations, problems faced by the Sri Lankan LGBT community still remain ignored.? ?
?
Taking public transport, be it the train or the bus and on the way to work, studying in school or in tuition classes, hanging out with friends in public places, going to a super market to grab some goodies, meeting special people at special places etc., are events and activities that make our lives eventful. Do you know that for LGBT persons in our country, all the above mentioned activities can even leave them disappointed about their existence in the world? This is due to the discrimination they encounter everyday. Due to this discrimination, Sri Lankan LGBT people have suffered a lot silently and many have even ended their lives.? ?
?
The EQUAL GROUND, an organization working for the rights of LGBTIQ people in Sri Lanka, stated that approximately 19.6% (753,973) of the adults aged 18-years and older living in Colombo, Matara, Nuwara Eliya and Kandy in 2017 are either lesbian, gay, bisexual and/or transgender. The organization goes with a beautiful saying ?when differences are no longer seen as reasons for conflict, they can be celebrated?.? ?

?
Social exclusion
?
Regrettably, LGBT people are excluded from society in many countries including Sri Lanka. In the world, Iceland, the Netherlands, Sweden and Denmark were found to be the countries that accepted them the most. Although Sri Lanka along with the other countries in the world is in a new era with the astonishing technological revolutions, a shift in attitudes toward LGBT people appears to be a long shot.? ?
?
The present Government made an attempt in January last year to stop discrimination based on sexual orientation. However, as a result of protests by some ministers, the Cabinet rejected the proposal for the provision which had been included, under women?s rights, in the draft on the Human Rights Action Plan seeking not to discriminate anyone on sexual orientation.? ?
I still cannot understand why Sri Lanka is still going ahead with colonial laws to marginalize the LGBTIQ people. The Government is responsible for ensuring equality for all parts of the community
Rosanna Flamer-Caldera
EQUAL GROUND Executive Director
?
What does the phrase ?LGBT community? mean? Why is the ?LGBT? notion problematic? Chances are if you don?t properly know what it means, you might think the term LGBT as a psychiatric disorder and an epidemic gifted by the Western culture, destroying cultural, religious and traditional values of the country. That is how the majority of Sri Lankans view the LGBT community. But just stop for a minute, think and try to feel that you were one of them.? ?
?
The Daily Mirror spoke to EQUAL GROUND Executive Director Rosanna Flamer-Caldera who has been active in the struggle for LGBTIQ rights in Sri Lanka and internationally since 1999.? ?
?
?The lack of social recognition has gravely affected the capacity of LGBT people to fully access and enjoy their rights as other citizens. This discrimination is supported by the existing laws ? Section 365A of the Sri Lanka Penal Code ? that criminalize homosexuality. First and foremost homosexuality should be decriminalized in Sri Lanka,? she said.? ?
?
The Sri Lankan LGBT community that stepped out in the recent past with their identities is still struggling for inclusivity.? ?
Lesbians are often forced into marriage against their will resulting in a lifetime of emotional, physical and sexual abuse
?
She noted that everyone should be able to respect the right of the LGBT people to make decisions about their personal lives with liberty.? ?
?
?I still cannot understand why Sri Lanka is still going ahead with colonial laws to marginalize the LGBTIQ people. The Government is responsible for ensuring equality for all parts of the community regardless of race, gender, religions, etc,? Rosanna pointed out.? ?
?
?On the outer side of the high walls in Welikada Prison, large bold letters declare: Prisoners are also Human Beings. If so, why can?t people accept and respect LGBTIQ people in Sri Lanka?,? she asked.? ?
?
She called for new regulations to prevent discrimination of LGBT people.? ?
?
She also noted that the reaction of parents, family members, and loved ones at the moment of coming out is crucial both for the LGBTIQ individual and for the future relationship of that family.? ??During this moment, there is much at stake. The coming-out moment can amount to a pivotal role in young people?s mental health?and that family support for LGBTQ youth matters tremendously,? she added.? ?
?
?There are lots of myths about sexual orientations and what they all mean. Many members of the LGBT community still experience prejudice, hatred and threats to their safety on a daily basis due to these myths. Our organization EQUAL GROUND is carrying out awareness programmes to bust such myths and misunderstandings about this community,? said Rosanna.? ?
?
Legal inclusion
?
According to the existing Sri Lankan law, only ?normal citizens? should be entitled to full citizenship rights, indicating that the ?normal citizen? should be heterosexual. As of now, people who are not heterosexual are not entitled for all the rights in the Constitution in Sri Lanka.? ?
?
Trans women are harassed verbally, physically and sexually for their gender identity and expressions
?
As per the recent findings, these marginalized groups of people are also more likely to avoid calling the police because of fear of anti -LGBT treatment. Many LGBT people have also reported experiencing unpleasant and unfair treatment due to their sexual orientation or gender identity when they sought legal assistance for any issue they faced.? ?
?
Any pathway which could take the country to be inclusive begins with the decriminalization of homosexuality and proceeds to fundamental rights.?
?
To discuss about the legal matters pertaining to the LGBT people in Sri Lanka, the Daily Mirror spoke to Former Human Rights Commissioner Dr. Prathiba Mahanamahewa. He spoke about the emergency and necessary requirement to amend the Penal Code in order to recognize the community rights by decriminalizing the following sections.? ?
Also these community members are verbally harassed at police stations and sexually victimized. It is needed to incorporate sexual orientation in a new Constitution
Dr. Prathiba Mahanamahewa
Former Human Rights Commissioner
?
Section 365 and Section 365A of the Penal Code describe that the unnatural offences and Acts of gross indecency between persons shall be punished with rigorous imprisonment for a term not less than 10 years and not exceeding twenty years with a fine and compensation.? ?
?
Section 399 of the Penal Code is used by the police to further discriminate and arrest members of this community. This section defines cheating by personating (Gender impersonation). This section is mostly used against trans-genders because after the plastic operation which transforms them to a different gender, their identity documents bear the opposite gender.? ?
?
Section 07 of 1841 Vagrants Ordinance is used against them to charge for soliciting and acts of indecency in public places. Imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months and a fine of 100 rupees is imposed. Therefore, community members cannot even remain at a public bus stand for more than half an hour because they might get arrested.? ?
?
?When they are arrested by the police and produced before a magistrate they are sent for a mandatory blood test. But, there are some reported cases when they are arrested two to three times for a week they have to repeat this test and it amounts to the harassment of the community members,? said Mahanamahewa.
?
?Article 12.1 and 12.2 of the Constitution protect and guarantee the right to equality as a fundamental human right. But LGBTIQ community members are reputedly discriminated against in police stations and public places. Even after they provide their identity certificate, the police officers eagerly wait to conduct a body check in some incidents. Also these community members are verbally harassed at police stations and sexually victimized. It is needed to incorporate sexual orientation in a new Constitution,? he added.? ?
?
According to a study conducted by the EQUAL GROUND with responses from 470 individuals who identified as lesbian, gay, bisexual, heterosexual and transgender, the majority of these LGBT persons face stigma and discrimination in government services including education and healthcare.? ?
?
Some have also been physically attacked and verbally abused in public because of their sexual orientation and/or gender identity/expression. Stigma is deep-rooted and even though numbers being just a few, some LGBT persons themselves feel that they are mentally ill (8.7%) and/or abnormal (3.3%) because they associate themselves with the LGBT identity. However, even though the law criminalizes consenting sexual relations between members of the same sex in Sri Lanka, no LGBT person believes he or she should be punished by the law because of sexual orientation.? ?
?
Since the issue is not limited to LGBT people, I think awareness on ethnicity, class, race and religion should also be increased
?
Changes in education
?
Speaking to the Daily Mirror, Dr. Harini Amarasuriya, a Sociology Professor at the Open University, said the problem with social acceptance does not affect only the LGBT people, but also all the minority groups in Sri Lanka.? ?
?
?There are conservative sections in any society. That is why the LGBT issue is highlighted in this country. The voice of the conservative sections is so loud that the voices of those who are not conservative minded cannot even be heard,? she said.? ?
?
She opined that first of all people should be able to learn about other kinds of cultures, sexualities, races, classes and religions to simply accept that there are many different ones other than their own.? ?
There are conservative sections in any society. That is why the LGBT issue is highlighted in this country. The voice of the conservative sections is so loud
Dr. Harini Amarasuriya
Sociology Professor at the Open University
?
?People need to start learning more about the diversity and surround themselves with diverse groups of people. Being open to learning about different things also can encourage people to have diverse friend groups that include people of all different races, ethnicities, religions and sexual orientations,? she said.? ?
?
Amarasuriya was of the view that in order to create a society where LGBT people can live freely and with dignity, education on sexuality and sexual orientation should be introduced.? ?
?
She noted that school plays a very important role in creating a society that?s aware and therefore subjects on sexual orientations and gender should be made mandatory in the school syllabus.? ??
?
?Since the issue is not limited to LGBT people, I think awareness on ethnicity, class, race and religion should also be increased. Awareness should be increased in order to promote a fair and permissive attitude towards those whose sexuality, race, religion, nationality differ from one?s own. Those values should be strongly promoted,? said Dr. Amarasuriya.? ?
?
In this course, political leaders and the media have important roles to play, she added.? ?
?
Following are two real life stories of two Sri Lankans who identified themselves as gay and lesbian. The first story about the lesbian couple was uncovered by the EQUAL GROUND in its recent report. The second story about the gay person is based on an interview done with him by the writer. Names have been changed to?
ensure confidentiality.? ?
?
?
?We were assaulted and forced into heterosexual marriages?
?I had obtained my primary education at a primary school and studied up to 5th Grade in that school and then changed to another. My mother had passed away and I was living with my father and my eldest sister. I had wanted to dress and behave like a boy and used to cut my hair short and dress up in T-shirts and trousers.?
During my school days, I tried to start relationships with many girls, but failed. I was determined to somehow start an affair with a girl. When I finished my Advanced Level Exam and while staying at home I always associated with boys. I used to ride bicycles and tried to get friendly with girls many times.?
Later the villagers had got to know of my behaviour and started insulting me and they did not allow me into their houses.?
In 1992 I started an affair with a girl by the name of Maala. We started working in a garment factory in Nochchiyagama. By this time our affair was revealed to the villagers and co-workers and we could not continue working there. Therefore we left that garment factory in 1994 and had come to a boarding house in Colombo and started living together. After living together for almost two years we were found by our family members and were brought back to the village and assaulted.?
Maala was forced into marrying a man from the Army and I too was forcibly given in marriage to a man who was 8 years younger than I.?
?
?I wanted to commit suicide for being gay and being discriminated against?
?
?Since childhood, all what I had heard about being gay, lesbian and transgender was very negative and disturbing.
Since my behaviour was different from other students in my school, I was bullied. Whenever I behaved freely, I have always felt humiliation. According to typical social beliefs, boys should be mischievous and girls should be innocent. If a boy is innocent, people think there should be something wrong with him.
When others always talk of how memorable their school lives were and that they want to return to that time, I don?t even want to think about it. I did not have a happy school life. School was always a miserable place where I faced humiliation and discrimination.
I was rejected by my friends because I was not a stereotype. In grades 6 and 7 in my school, I was branded with different names.
My school was a place where teachers promoted Victorian values which specified how men and women should be. Since I was behaving as neither, I was bullied.
From morning till afternoon, I faced very bad experiences within my classroom. It was very upsetting.
When I was in grade 10, I was contemplating suicide due to being bullied. I looked for options to kill myself because I could not take it anymore. But, at the same time, I was praying to my God. Meanwhile, I somehow got an opportunity to read about psychology. I was able to learn many things and stabilize my mind.
For my higher studies I came to Colombo, a place where I could find many people like me. There was a special person among them? to whom I got very much attached to.
When I was in grade 10, I was contemplating suicide due to being bullied. I looked for options to kill myself because I could not take it anymore. But, at the same time, I was praying to my God
?
He was an extremely nice person and a good listener. I clearly identified myself as gay only when I started falling for him. I could not believe myself having a relationship with another guy. Being surrounded by role models presented by the media since the day we were born, it was a shock to me to stand as someone who is different from those stereotypes. Although he was a nice person, the pressure of having that relationship doubled my stress.
We used to communicate as best friends and share our problems with each other. He was under medication for depression for a long time. I remember him calling me and crying. Every time he called me, he told me how lonely he felt because he had been rejected by his family and his friends for being gay.
He committed suicide last year.
The society refers to our feelings as addiction. No one is able to get into our shoes and understand our feelings. Teachers in school only promote toxic masculine ideas and feminine ideas.?
?
The Sri Lankan society is divided ethnically, culturally and religiously. But, at the end of the day, all are humans. When it comes to LGBTIQ people, the society has set up a different and discriminative lenses to look at them.? ?
?
Cultivating the acceptance for LGBTIQ community in the Sri Lankan society is not an easy task. In a country where people cannot even tolerate other religions, races and beliefs and consequently get into brutal conflicts such as the recent riots in Kandy District, accepting the LGBTIQ community is a long shot.? ?
?
If the responsible parties show real interest and come up with a stronger plan comprising a broader and coordinated educational effort, changing the attitudes toward LGBT people in Sri Lanka can be achieved.??

Responsible Fashion Summit 2nd edition kicks off with Designer Perspective
	
The theme for the 2nd Responsible Fashion Summit held was ?Earth Sensitive?, with nearly every stakeholder of the fashion supply chain sharing knowledge of direction. It commenced with three key international designers, David Abraham, Sharleen Ernster and Heidi Gosman, who shared important perspectives, including disposal of the garments being considered, as part of the design thought process, which is something that has not been strongly followed by designers, resulting in landfill issues.
Sharleen Ernster on the vision behind ?We-are-HAH?:? One of the purposes behind this brand was to slow down the Fashion cycle and create a product with purpose and to utilize product processes that were sustainable, in order to leave a better planet and legacy for the next generation. I have had the great privilege of working for some of the biggest brands in the World?and that introduced me to some of the most incredible manufacturers in the World. One of the most beautiful things about working for the larger corporations is that it exposes you to the latest technology and advancements. Sri Lanka has always been on the forefront of green technology. With the introduction to technology particularly from this region, I was able to start a business founded on 3 pillars ? sustainability, good to the consumer and transparency.?
Heidi Gosman of Heidi Klein Swim spoke on how her team approaches a design: ?As a team we always start with the design. We consider the impact on the environment at each stage of? manufacture and then work backwards in coming up with the design. In the UK we do not recycle clothes as much as we should be, and it adds to the landfills, but this is something me and my team are looking at.?
David Abraham shared his insight into values he holds close and how to achieve the right balance between design, sustainability and disposability; three things that don?t support each other. ?The world is divided into consumers and producers; largely we consider the producers in the East and the consumers in the West. So we are paying the price for the consumption in the west and as designers we cannot influence the trends as the trends are produced by the consumers. It will be a slow change and in a few years the situation will change as the East is on the rise. Hopefully we will learn from this and learn from the mistakes we have made and hopefully we will learn that this is something we need to be aware of.?
Responsible Fashion Summit is part of The Responsible Fashion Movement that focuses on responsibility, accountability and transparency. It has defined 8 impact areas as the basis of solutions to issues that the global fashion industry faces. The Responsible Fashion Movement? has modelled? itself on the most relevant aspect of solutions and longevity. Fashion currently ranks among the top 3 most polluting industries in the world is drawing attention and yet the action to reduce negative impact is still slow in gaining momentum.?
The sustainable fashion products continue to grow at a steady pace. It is led by an ever increasing population of aware and discerning consumers in US, Europe and parts of Asia which is beginning to put pressure on global fashion brands to open their doors to clean fashion. The manufacturers who will move in this direction earlier will have an advantage. There also exists a wide gap between the action of designers and manufacturers; hence so far every action is resting with the manufacturers. The designers are in a position to lead the corrective action.
The Responsible Fashion Movement is endorsed by The Commonwealth Fashion Council (CFC), London. Daniel Hatton, Director and CEO of the CFC is in Colombo to speak at the forum. Responsible Fashion Summit is presented by MAS Holdings, hosted at Shangri-La Hotel, Colombo, in association with Hirdaramani Group, Beira Group, BMW i3 and The Design Development Corporation.

Sand mining permits as rewards!
	
?
A powerful politico recently carried out a successful underhand operation to take a local body ousting the majority group elected from a newly formed political party.
?
Highly elated over this success, the politico decided to offer sand mining permits as rewards to several members, who were closely associated with him in carrying out the masterstroke.?
The other members, who helped in the power-transfer had got annoyed when they heard that only a section of them were going to get the sand-mining permits. So, they had threatened the politico with a backlash if the permits were to be restricted to a select few.?
?We were all in the game on an equal footing. Treat us all equally if you want to reward us for our role,? they had told the politico.?
Following this angry reaction, the politico had put his reward plan on hold, they say.?

Taking a closer look at Subfertility
	
?
It is no secret that a newlywed couple hopes for a healthy infant. After the marriage about 90% of couples conceive. There are also miscarriages. The balance 10% is sub fertile. Therefore you should not be worried about subfertility until one year after marriage if you are less than 35 years of age.
Miscarriages are not always due to some diseases. In some couples, there is no cause for this.??
?
What are the causes for subfertility???
To conceive, germ cells (Ovum and Sperm) from both partners should fertilize. Any cause that prevents fertilization could be a cause of subfertility.??
1. Not having ovulation or infrequent ovulation. (Infrequent menstruation is a feature in those patients.??
2. Defects of Sperms (Reduced number, activity or abnormal - shaped sperms)? ?
3. Blockage of fallopian tubes (these are common after sexually transmitting diseases or pelvic infections)??
4. Endometriosis (endometrial cells are usually situated within the uterine inner layer. But in some cases these cells are found outside the uterus and these cells grow and bleed with each menstruation causing problems.??
5. Defects of cervix of uterus (Infections or endometriosis of cervix may destroy sperms at cervical level preventing conception)? ?
6. Defects in intercourse (partial impotence, premature ejaculation)??
?
What are the tests in subfertility???
Seminal fluid analysis (SFA) is the first test to be done. If it is normal, the female partner should be investigated. Ovulation is tested with blood test.? ?
If there are other conditions (thyroid diseases, polycystic ovarian diseases) hormones should be tested. Alternatively ,we can scan ovaries to confirm poly cystic ovarian disease.?
If there is a history of pelvic infections or miscarriages, fallopian tubes should be tested for patency as a first line investigation. This is done by an X-ray test (HSG) or by laparoscopy and dye test which needs hospitalization.??
?
What are the treatments???
If the cause is anovulation (not forming egg cells) we have to induce egg formation with medicines ( Clomiphene Citrate, Letrozole)? ?
If the cause is sperm defects, we have to correct that with medication. And if is in tubes, corrective surgery is the treatment.? ?

The appalling polling stations
	
I have been living in my neighbourhood for over 35 years. From the day we moved here, it has been the same polling station. It does not follow the rules of being within walking distance. It does not cater to elders or disabled. It does not follow hygiene norms. It does not fill the rules of a prescribed number of voters only, to be made available to. Voters of then and now have trebled, but the polling station remains the same.??
Our polling station is off Narahenpita Road, opposite the Borella cemetery and yet cannot be accessed from that side, due to the road being one way now. We have to travel from the further end, on the left side of the road, park and walk..Down a sandy narrow lane on which vehicles are prohibited to travel, through a gate manned by police, and up some steep steps. Physically helped by a cop! A Community Hall, dusty and unclean. It has been the station for all those years and beyond?first catering to a few voters in the area, but never changed to a more acceptable hall as many more residences, shops and offices have come up there.??
I wrote to the Election Commissioner on this matter, and got a reply from the famous Mr. Deshapriya, stating that he would attend to it. I asked for polling stations to be more accessible to elders. There are many school halls, and such available. I hoped that they shift to another premise. Or addition it to the present one. But there has been no change, as the last election had the same situation.??
My friend?s mother and family, vote in a school hall. Her mother is old and can walk with difficulty. The gate to the school was padlocked and the police said they do not have the key ? only the principal has it and was not present. They had to help this old lady physically jump over the gate. They too wrote to the Election office and received no reply.??
My cousin lives in Borella, near the cemetery. Her polling area can only be accessed through a dirty lavatory which has not been cleaned. No other approach. She has been going there for years, and the last time due to her advancement in years, she did not go and vote! The conditions being so unbearable.??
We have to prepare our minds for days before we summon up courage to go to such awful premises.??
I doubt the President, Prime Minister, and other such politicians have these conditions when they go and vote. After all?the newspapers carry pleasant photos of them, walking into huge halls- so clean.? ?
Do they know what the common man goes through to cast his vote? Does anyone care???

?The First and Last? by Hemantha Perera An unusual kind of photography book
	
Coming across this unusual photography book at the Public Library, I thought of reviewing, it as books of this nature rarely get reviewed. ?The First & Last? is a photography book by Hemantha Perera. But it?s one with a difference, which speaks with both pictures and words, marking the cycle of life with spirituality as the central vision.??
Hemantha Perera has a Catholic religious background and studied photography at the Pamunuwila Photographic Art Society starting in 1992. In his foreword to the book, the author states that his photographic journey started when his father gave him a Pentax K1000 camera and he rode a bicyc
le to a rendezvous near a cemetery to meet his future photography guru, Ubert Danwatte Liyanage. He further writes: ?That teacher-student relationship grew and helped me to see life?s depth and beauty, and allowed me to create a heartbeat inside that mechanical box devoid of feeling.???
The text is bilingual (Sinhala and English) and most of the 53 photographs inside are black and white. This adds cohesion to his sombre text, which is an examination of the meaning of life. He sometimes tries to interpret it in the context of his own religion, for example when he quotes from the Book of Genesis. But it often takes a more universal flavour.? ?
His photo-text starts with a quote from Indian poet Sarojini Naidu ? ?Sannaliyane, Sannaliyane, Katada Enduma Wiyanne? ? (Weaver, Weaver, for whom are you weaving this cloth). It brings to mind immediately the song written by Mahagama Sekara and sung so movingly by W. D. Amaradeva. It?s a song that encompasses life from its inception till death.? ?
?
?
The accompanying photograph shows a couple with their newborn baby, the woman carrying the baby in her arms. The opposite page shows a portal. It looks like the door of a fortress. But that doesn?t really matter and the only thing we need to know is that it is a door leading to somewhere.??
This is followed by images of children ? at play, or pensive. There is a child?s face juxtaposed with that of an old balloon seller. There is an image showing the texture of a tree bark, and others show water and waves. There are images of religious icons ? rock sculpture of a Naga figure in relief, a little girl walking down a flight of stone steps towards a moonstone, an alms giving and a group of Catholic priests. A girl stands at the seashore and watches a softly breaking wave which looks like it?s encircling her. We are made aware, again and again, of man?s intimate ties with nature and spirituality. The overall mood is sombre, and the poet?s question to the weaver hangs over the entire design like an epitaph.? ?
It is a very unusual kind of photography book, leaving out the picturesque and trying to convey its idea through mood and texture rather than colour.??

The front guard and the rearguard
	
Public sector employees have been disgruntled with the way the government has operated for quite some time
There?s a curious contradiction with respect to the strikes that we are seeing now. The strikers are enthusiastic about what they are demonstrating against, and are not in any mood to placate the powers that be, in return for petty favours
Sri Lanka has turned into a Picket Republic. The trade union movement has a front guard in the form of the professionals and a rearguard in the form of the blue collar workers
2015 and 2016, years of optimism, hope, and a little growth, have been followed by 2017 and 2018, years of cynicism, darkness, and not a little regression. The writing, some would say, is on the wall, and unless the government acts swiftly, it can only lead itself to its own defeat at the hands of a newcomer to the political race (I am, of course, talking about the Gotabaya Rajapaksa phenomenon). On all fronts, the people are being assailed with one overbearing issue after another, from petrol prices to bus fares. Those in power, roosted atop their comfortable nests, do not seem to mind or care, and even if they do, the problems assailing us aren?t assailing them. But the administration is feeling the heat, even if it?s slow to react to that heat, and this in the form of the most potent wave of strikes this country has witnessed in recent years.? ?
Inevitable, some might say. Yes, but to an extent only. The truth is that public sector employees have been disgruntled with the way the government has operated for quite some time and 2017 marked a turning point of sorts for the trade unions attached to that public sector. Fears of the private sphere taking over the public, be it in health, education, or even essential services like electricity and water, have compelled the unions to take to the streets and challenge the status quo in ways which have not been matched before, especially not during the Mahinda Rajapaksa regime. (Obviously, given that the Rajapaksas were not going to be tolerant with the unions, they were too cautious when treading on territory they are basically rampaging through now.) And yet, this is not the most neo-liberal regime this country has inherited. It is a far cry from the Chandrika Kumaratunga regime and this because, despite the UNP?s blatant right-wing economic policy, it has on paper at least become a social market, not ?laissez faire?, party. As such, the issues with the unions are more complex, more multifarious.? ?
There?s a curious contradiction with respect to the strikes that we are seeing now. The strikers are enthusiastic about what they are demonstrating against, and are not in any mood to placate the powers that be, in return for petty favours, but what they are doing is being described by commentators as a licence for the former regime to step in and institutionalise harsher and stronger anti-union policies. W. A. Sunil, in an article written to the World Socialist Web and tellingly headlined ?Sri Lankan unions betray national postal strike?, complains that the postal union leaders more or less conceded ground to the government because of their fear that continuing the strike would lead to the rest of the public sector walking out on the regime, giving the Pohottuwa carte-blanche to enter the political sphere and take leadership. ?Why not oppose both - the government and Mahinda Rajapaksa?? he quotes a postal office worker from Hatton.? ?
The problem is that it is difficult to oppose both because the one implies a marked absence of the other. In Sri Lanka, as with even the United States, change, radical or democratic, has been premised on substituting one order for another. It is not in the interests of the government to shift the leadership to its sworn enemy and this the public sector, or so supporters of the government claim, has not properly heeded. For this reason, editorials from the state media are rife with accusations to the effect that the postal workers and strikers from other essential sectors (like water and electricity) are working for power-hungry politicians. This, of course, is erroneous, since those power-hungry politicians - the lackeys of the Rajapaksas - are as derided by the strikers as those in power. As Ranjan Jayalal, the fierce, almost Jacobin Secretary of the Workers Union at the Ceylon Electricity Board, stated in no uncertain terms at a protest held in Colombo on June 20, the anomalies they were facing with regard to their salaries in relation to the salaries of engineers have a great deal to do with Mahinda Rajapaksa, whom they (the union workers) would dearly love to see being punished alongside Maithripala Sirisena, Ranil Wickremesinghe and Ranjith Siyambalapitiya.?
The CEB Union led the longest ever strike last year, at eight days. That record was matched and then broken by the postal workers? strike this year. What?s next? One can only guess, so I am guessing that we will continue to see further disruptions to water, the government petrol bowser operators (the private operators have already threatened the government), and even the SLCTB (which has not struck work in a long, long time).? ?
Either way, it is important to note that all these strikes and disruptions to essential services (the CEB strike last year, for instance, left outstation, faraway places like Polonnaruwa and Anuradhapura without electricity for six days) can be traced to Mahinda Rajapaksa?s regime. Ranjan Jayalal did not wake up one fine morning in April and September 2017 and decide that the union needed to continually refrain from work as a sign of protest. No. Even in 2012, he was actively protesting against the salary scale anomalies which the Rajapaksas and the then Minister for Power and Energy had sanctioned (hiking it from 1:6 to 1:9). There was another dimension to the problem: CEB depots in Karawella and Galapitamada were allegedly to be privatised, to be passed over to Chinese hands. With the present government?s ambiguous love affair with China, which led last year to a complete shutdown in fuel distribution owing to (surprise, surprise!) a strike by petroleum workers, it is not hard to determine that we may well see a return to the old order if, with no feasible alternative in sight, it decides to privatise in part at least those services again. ?We will never ever let the consumer be burdened by price hikes!? these strikers roar confidently. Perhaps, but I sadly believe that they are shouting to deaf ears. Not too difficult to find out why.? ?
Fears of the private sphere taking over the public, have compelled the unions to take to the streets and challenge the status quo in ways which have not been?matched before
The nationalists, the professionals, those opposed to the government on economic as well as cultural grounds, cannot be counted on to sympathise with workers who would be hard done by even with the government of their (the nationalists) preference in power. There has never been any love lost between the public sector and Mahinda Rajapaksa, barring exceptions like the SLCTB, which owes its resurrection to Dinesh Gunawardena. The interests of those professional nationalists, of the Viyath Maga and Yuthukama Sanvada Kavaya camps, therefore, are miles away from the interests of Ranjan Jayalal, Chinthaka Bandara, and the other prominent trade union leaders. To give just one example, the CEB engineers may be reliable when it comes to opposition to the Free Trade Agreement with Singapore (which many professional fronts are opposing anyway), but they are not reliable when it comes to crackdowns on lower level staff, i.e. the staff who are represented by Jayalal and the CEB Workers? Union.? ?
Sri Lanka has turned into a Picket Republic. The trade union movement has a front guard in the form of the professionals and a rearguard in the form of the blue collar workers. These two used to coincide in the heady, tumultuous days of the Chandrika Kumaratunga regime (Sri Lanka was left in the dark, literally, for three days because both the workers and the engineers stopped work at the National Grid, protesting against the regime?s drive towards privatising the CEB and LECO). They do not coincide. Not anymore. Probably this explains why and how Mahinda and his cohorts have done their best to court and curry favour with the former group, the front guard, especially through Viyath Maga. The type of industry the purveyors of VM envision is one that is buttressed by a ruthless admixture of populism and economics, anti-union in the strongest sense of that term. That, plus the fact that these policy anomalies which the unions are combating, go back to the former regime (even for the postal workers, who are taking to task a circular issued in 2006, one year after Rajapaksa assumed his first term in office), means that the rearguard is swearing vengeance on both the incumbent and his predecessor. The problem here, however, is that the idealism expressed by the likes of W. A. Sunil and outfits like the World Socialist Web just doesn?t work out in reality: if you demonstrate against this government to such an extent that you become capable even of toppling it from power, the most immediate consequence would materialise in the form of a Rajapaksa Restoration.? ?
Once you topple the one, and bring in the other, it won?t be too far away when these unions, swept away by the rhetoric of Marx and Lenin, will face a more repressive threat, not just to the resolution of their problems, but also to their very lives. The sad addendum here is that neither the unions nor the government seem to have grasped this. The one continues to agitate. The other continues to merely resist the agitation.? ?

Vijeyakala Lacked Political Maturity
	
State Minister of Child Affairs Vijeyakala Maheswaran, who stirred controversy by making a statement about the need for an organisation like the LTTE, has not denied the fact that the Tamil people were free when the terrorist outfit operated in the north.? ?
Her statement made in Jaffna recently affirms that a rebel group like the LTTE is needed if children in the north are to attend school and later return home safely. She has not denied this part of her statement.? ?
We must not forget that Vijeyakala is now a politician and represents the Unity Government. It seems what she rattled away in a speech is now turning adversely against her. She has said that there was a slip of the tongue during her comments attributed to the LTTE. She said that people were not willing to discard the rebel group from their hearts.? ?
Since details of the controversial speech went viral in mainstream media the Unity Government has been forced to take action against the minister from Jaffna. Speaker Karu Jaysuriya has already informed the Attorney General to check whether the statements made by Vijeyakala have violated the Constitution or any other law of the country.? ?
UNP back benchers have demanded the minister be stripped of her portfolio. There was an uproar in Parliament on Tuesday when the joint opposition protested against the statements made by Vijeyakala. The Prime Minister has said that the Government has decided on a course of action to be taken against the controversial minister.? ?
When taking a close look at the issue it seems that the female Tamil minister lacks maturity. It seems she got carried away when making the speech and forgot for a moment that she was a representative of the Government.?
?
The Tamil community in the north got a second lease of life after the Unity Government assumed power in 2015. Much of their lands have been handed back and Vijeyakala herself has acknowledged this as a positive sign in the Government?s efforts towards solving the issues of the Tamil minority.? ?
Parts of Vijeyakala?s statement which attribute to the need to create an environment for school children to walk freely are not unsupported. We heard of violent incidents in the north this year where armed groups caused violence in the community. The Sri Lanka Army has shown displeasure over certain elements wanting to pin the LTTE label on these incidents. Even the Defence Minister has ruled out there being threats to national security as far as the north is concerned.? ?
But concerned citizens can not deny the fact that Jaffna is the heart of the Tamil community and still remains a sensitive spot with regard to the national issue. Recently we heard of the Tamil community wanting to commemorate civilians who died during the the armed conflict. The Government quite rightly allowed that right, but denied anybody to commemorate slain tiger rebels.? ?
When the Tiger rebels were militarily crushed in 2009 it had an effect of a flat tyre on the Tamil community. This is a country where people of any community have to stage protests, sometimes aggressive ones, to win their rights. Most Sri Lankan Governments have learned through experiences in solving issues of the minorities and have never been known to be proactive. The Tamil community now lacks a powerful leader despite having their very own R.Sampanthan as the Leader of the Opposition.? ?
Vijeyakala?s role in Tamil politics is important at this stage because she is working alongside the Government in the reconciliation process. The need of the Tamil people now is a political solution and economic development in the north. Vijeyakala must grow with maturity and envisage a future for the Tamils without harbouring thoughts of armed groups coming into operation once again. That past where the LTTE existed is done and dusted. The majority of right thinking Tamils would never wish for an armed struggle even in their dreams!? ??

What you should do during an influenza outbreak
	
?
The influenza virus is back with a vengeance. This time it has been accompanied most probably by two other colleagues namely RSV and Adenovirus. Together these three infections can devastate every man, woman and child. The purpose of this article would be not to trouble the readers with details of these viruses, but to provide vital information on how to survive the flu. It is very important for parents to protect their children from this disease. In order to enlighten out readers on the topic of influenza we decided to speak to Consultant Paediatrician Dr. Dilusha Atukorale, MBBS (Colombo) MD (Paediatrics) and Diploma in Child Health.?
?
How to identify?the flu?
To identify the influenza infection first we need to understand the human body parts that get affected. Influenza spreads through droplets of fluid. Inhalation of these can allow the virus to settle in our breathing system (respiratory system). Namely any area in our breathing system can get affected by influenza. The inner aspect of the nose, the air filled cavities inside our skull which we call sinuses (beneath your eyebrows, cheeks and behind your ears), the back of your throat, the voice box ( larynx) and the lungs are infected. This results in headaches, nasal watery discharge, sneezing, sore throat, change in voice and cough.Patients also suffer from an ill feeling. This is because the virus is capable of spreading through the blood stream to other organs. Children might become less active and talkative. They also prefer to rest and sleep when the infection is doing its harm to the body.Fever is also a common manifestation of influenza. Especially children might be vomiting if the infection is severe.
?
How to prevent children from acquiring influenza?
There are some simple steps that every parent should teach their kids in order to avoid this infection. Hand washing is one key habits that might prevent the spread of influenza.?
Daily, children touch thousands of objects, be it tables, books, toys at a pre-school or taps at a public washroom. Influenza Virus may be harboured as a tiny liquid droplet in these objects. Fingers which are contaminated with these virus droplets might reach the eye, nostril or the mouth in the next moment.As mentioned earlier when the virus droplets reach the breathing system it tends to settle in and multiply. Even the outer layers of the eyeball can absorb the influenza virus. Wiping the eyes might cause the germs to invade. Using a handkerchief has its pros and cons. Handkerchiefs are useful to prevent the spread of virus especially when sneezing. But sometimes when these are used to wipe away dirt in the hands and later utilized to clean the mouth/ nose, it can allow the virus to invade. Avoid taking children to hospitals when visiting that relative or friend who is ill. Especially the out patient units might be crowded with patients who are already having influenza. It is also better to avoid crowded places like markets where unidentified patients might be transmitting this disease.
?
This is what you should do if your child has features?of influenza
First parents need to differentiate between the common cold and influenza. A common cold has a slow onset and might present with a bit of runny nose, reduced activity of the child and sometimes cough. Usually a harmless cold does not cause high fever and muscle ache which in turn might be characteristic of influenza.There are some key features used to detect patients with complicated influenza. These are as follows.
1. The child does not interact with the parents and is unresponsive to stimulation?
2. Very fast breathing which we call tachypnoea?
3. Refusing drinks/ water
4. Bluish discoloration of skin with breathing difficulties
5. Highly irritated children?
6. After initial symptoms settle a severe cough appears.
?
A paediatrician?s assessment is necessary when these sinister signs start showing. Having said that mild influenza can easily be managed at home. Allow your child to rest. Offer drinks/ warm water as much as possible. The body needs to fight back against the virus. Any healthy child is well equipped with a good immune system to perform this task. Keep other children away from the patient. Insist on using a handkerchief when sneezing and washing hands. Even the elderly and pregnant mum?s should be kept away from the patient.There are blood tests to determine the type of influenza your child has. The paediatrcian might arrange throat swabs. There are categories of tablets called anti-viral medication, available as treatment. These should be recommended by a paediatrician who will decide whether a blood test or tablet is really necessary. There are vaccines meant for the prevention of influenza as well.We prefer to manage ill children symptomatically as well. This means treating kids so that they are comfortable at home. For blocked noses nasal drops/ decongestants can be used. For body aches and fever paracetamol is useful. Stuffy noses or sinuses can be treated with steam inhalation as well. Steam is an excellent mucolytic. This means steam can cause thick secretions in the breathing system to loosen up. A large proportion of children will recover from this dreaded flu by correct and sensible treatment.
