All didn?t raise their hands!
	
?
The current Number Two the other day sent for a group of Pohottuwa seniors, who were elevated to top team status in his new regime.
?
The group that called at the familiar Vijerama official residence post-haste was warmly welcomed by their boss.
After entertaining them to tea, Number Two addressed the grim-faced loyalists.
?I offered you portfolios as soon as I assumed office because I considered it my bounden duty. Now it has become necessary for me to offer portfolios to several others who have thrown in their lot with us. But there is only one single vacancy available!?
The former strongman paused for a minute or two for the effect of what he said to sink in.
Presently he continued: ?To be brief, I wanted to see you all, to find out whether there are any among you willing to resign to make way for the newcomers!?
Five politicos among the group immediately raised their hands. ?We are ready to resign whenever you want!? they said in unison.
One may ask who were the politicos who readily expressed their willingness to resign immediately.
One of them was a politico who entered the august assembly the same day with the current Number Two.? A legal expert, a big-mouthed character, a Southerner at Diyawanna since 1983 and a stalwart from the upcountry account for the remaining four, they say.

Ayodhya; snowballing into a bigger crisis
	
The Shiv Sena?smove to hold a massive rally, last Sunday, in Ayodhya urging the putting up of a Ram temple on the site of former Babri mosque, has many interpretations. The rally supported and attended by BJP parent party Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) is primarily viewed by others as a political strategy by the BJP to divert public attention ahead of the Lok Sabha polls.
?To divert attention from their failures, they raised the Ram Mandir issue. Had their intentions been good they needn?t have waited for five years. It?s their political tactic, nothing else. Whatever their associates like Shiv Sena and VHP are doing is part of their conspiracy,? four times Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh and leader of Bahujan Samaj Party chief, Mayawati said in a statement.
The next hearing of the Supreme Court petitions on the disputed site is due in January 2019. The last structure on the site, Babri Mosque, was demolished in 1992 by Hindu nationalist groups led by the BJP, RSS, Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) and a handful of other right wing groups. It was argued that the mosque has been built by demolishing a Hindu temple.
However the archaeological excavations carried out in the 2000-2003 period following court orders, have not found any evidence of an ancient Hindu temple in the site. On the other hand evidence of the existence of a Buddhist centre with ruins of stupas and Buddhist style pillars and structures, surfaced.
A petition urging the authorities to go by archaeological evidence and do justice to Buddhists was filed in the Supreme Court in March this year by a Buddhist. In July, the bench agreed to admit a writ application filed by another Buddhist petitioner claiming the Buddhist right to the site.
However all this is now politically undermined in the loud din of the Hindutva movement led by BJP Chief Minister of Yogi Adityanath and ably supported by the RSS and the Shiv Sena, the latter accused of several incidents of communal riots including 1970 riots in Maharashtra town of Bhiwandi which killed about 250 people, the 1984 riots in the same city that killed 146 people and 1992-1993 Bombay riots that massacred nearly?700 civilians.
Meanwhile at last Sunday?s gathering RSS Chief Mohan Bhagwat found fault with the courts for not making Ram temple a priority. ?Ram temple was not a priority for the Supreme Court? said Bhagwat whose organization stands accused of demolishing the Babri mosque in 1992 along with its off shoot BJP and a slew of right wing entities.
?We brought down the Babri mosque in 17 minutes, so how much time for a law? How much time does it take to draft the papers?? a senior Shiv Sena leader Sanjaya Raut had said at?Sunday?s rally.
The fact that the present political build up in Ayodhya belittling the judiciary is detrimental to the law and order situation in the country has been brought into the attention by the Samajwadi?Party (SP).
?A similar situation arose in 1992 and it is for everyone to see what happened...the matter is before the Supreme Court and everyone should show patience,? Shivpal Yadav, the younger brother of Samajwadi Party (SP) leader Mulayam Singh Yadav was quoted as saying.
Yadav pointed out if the organizations asking for a Ram temple that are unable to wait till the courts? ruling there?s enough and more land in and around the site to build a temple.
?Why this obstinacy to build a Ram temple at the spot where Babri mosque was razed,? he?had asked.
The simmering tensions in Ayodhya and the 20% Muslim strong state of Uttar Pradesh are likely to further strain the already fragile relations between Hindus and Muslims in the country. If Prime Minister Narendra Modi fails to exercise restraint at least at this juncture the whole episode is likely to boomerang on his government.

Banners with LTTE chief's pic land duo in jail
	
Two members of a fringe Tamil nationalist party were arrested on Tuesday for putting up banners with slain LTTE chief V Prabhakaran's photos at Mehul Circle at Mulund's New Junction. Mathiyajagan Sundaram (33) and Palanivel Ravindra (24) have been booked for defacing public property.
Sources said the members of Naam Tamilar Katchi, led by film director-turned-politician Seeman, erected the banners for Prabhakaran's 64th birth anniversary, on Monday. Prabhakaran was the leader of Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, a militant organization, that sought to create an independent Tamil state in the north and east of Sri Lanka. He was killed by Lankan forces in 2009.
After locals alerted Mulund police about the banners, they removed them and registered a case against unknown persons. "We booked them under the Maharashtra Prevention of Defacement of Property Act. On Tuesday, we identified two men involved in putting up the banners and arrested them. Both will be produced in court on Wednesday," said Sripad Kale, senior inspector, Mulund police.

CHANGING COLOuRS AMIDST SHATTERED DEMOCRACY!!!
	
?
On 14th November 2018, the hallowed precincts of Parliament were destroyed!!! These are the supposed gentlemen who we are expected to call ?honourable!!!? They disregard Parliamentary ethics and the accepted norms of behaviour because all they want to do is to make their presence felt; the louder the better!!! Again on 16th November 2018, there was an even worse show of thuggery. Nothing was sacred, no norms or rules were respected, they displayed typical rowdy behaviour completely oblivious to the fact that they were in the precincts of Parliament!!! THEY ARE AN ABSOLUTE DISGRACE AND OUR NATION STANDS DISGRACED BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT WE VOTED FOR THEM!!! NOTWITHSTANDING ALL THIS, WHAT ABOUT THE COST OF ALL THESE PUERILE, FUTILE PARLIAMENTARY SITTINGS!!! WHY SHOULD THE TAXPAYERS AND THE GENERAL PUBLIC PAY FOR THIS??? What about their Security Detail??? How many hundreds are constantly paid and fed when these people are in Parliament??? How much is the gas bill for all the vehicles that accompany them, sometimes even helicopters??? How come politicians in other countries don?t need this measure of security??? BECAUSE THEY ARE CLEAN!!!
?
Ban crossovers??
Their bank balances are so precious, that their integrity is not at all important, not at all!!! They can be green, they can be blue, none of their convictions is special and, they will take their chance with whoever is winning!!! One day they like the ?Elephant? the next day the ?Pohottuwa,? they are so desperate to stay in power!!! They are rootless and they are ruthless, one who crossed over twice even declared that it was his inalienable right!!! CHAMELEONS ALL!!! They want to take a supposed moral stand with ANYONE WHO RUNS THE LAND, SO THE CHORUS IS ?PICK ME FOR YOUR TEAM, I LIKE CROSSING OVER?!!! The recurring cause for alarm is that Members of Parliament are allowed to cross over from one party to another, allegedly for certain sums of money!!! That has to be stopped immediately; it should be built into the Constitution, made Unconstitutional!!! These aspirants to Parliament come bent in two, humbly begging for your vote, once they are in, they do not know who you are!!! You are expected to refer to them as ?Honourable? they pledge to be servants of the people so why should they be called ?Honorable????
?
Abolish Presidency
As we have said before, THE ABSOLUTE POWERS OF THE EXECUTIVE PRESIDENCY MUST FIRST BE ABOLISHED IF WE WERE TO MAINTAIN DEMOCRACY IN OUR LAND!!! The people of this country did not ask for an Executive Presidency, it was thrust upon them!!! As Dr Colvin R. de Silva rightly predicted the curse of the Executive Presidency is what has shattered and destroyed the democracy of this country!!!
?
Conspiracy
The late US President Dwight D. Eisenhower, in a speech delivered on March 6, 1956, said, and I quote: ?IF A POLITICAL PARTY DOES NOT HAVE ITS FOUNDATION IN THE DETERMINATION TO ADVANCE A CAUSE THAT IS RIGHT AND THAT IS MORAL, THEN IT IS NOT?
A POLITICAL PARTY, IT IS MERELY A CONSPIRACY TO SEIZE POWER!!!??
This aptly describes the situation our country is facing today; they are constantly seeking to advance a cause that is WRONG, IMMORAL AND UNCONSTITUTIONAL!!! We live in a world of declining moral values; tinkered and tampered with to the detriment of society and democracy!!! Truth is not politically expedient today because it has become a victim to politics!!! Those who lack courage; will always find a philosophy to justify the wrong they are doing!!!
?
Who pays??
The Prime Minister of Pakistan, Imran Khan, in the course of his address to the Central School in China, said that unfortunately Pakistan lost its way and what actually stopped Pakistan from achieving its full potential was ?CORRUPTION!!!? He went on to say that countries are poor not because they lack resources but because they are destroyed by State Institutions and the mindset that should be concentrating on developing human resources is diverted into mega projects and the worst part of CORRUPTION is MONEY LAUNDERING!!! Money leaves poor countries and goes into rich countries; almost a Trillion Dollars that leaves the developing world goes into the developed world and when money leaves the poor countries, it deprives the poor countries of reserves, it deprives the country of foreign exchange and they end up taking loans and WHO PAYS??? He affirmed that it is the corruption of the ruling elite that destroys State institutions and the money that should be spent on development never happens!!! It is because politicians constantly spend more money than they could raise on taxation; they waste and they waste and then we talk about countries, including ours, that are broke and they are broke because ignorant politicians consistently spend more money than they can raise and they borrow and they borrow and worse; they then print money because politicians and their Central Banks have machines that can print money!!! As a private citizen, you would go to prison for doing that but politicians and their Central Banks do it all the time and they explain to you that their countries are broke and they are broke!!! It is immoral to ask the taxpayer of any country to pick up the tab of failed politicians and failed banks!!!
?
Pathetic unprecedented situation
Patchwork will not do when what is called for is an overhaul!!! One of the reasons why our lives remain totally unchanged is because we are unreformed and untouched; stuck in the present unwilling and disinclined to break away from the structure and situations that constrain us, so we can be totally renewed!!! We need to protest, to come out and call this political bluff, didn?t the people of the Philippines, ordinary people like you and me, come out on to the streets and topple a President as powerful as Ferdinand Marcos??? Why then should we sit back and watch while these morons take away our democracy, deprive us of our freedom and, more importantly, act as though we are also a bunch of morons like them??? We are told that weak people seek revenge, well, our politicians have given us ample proof of that, strong people forgive and intelligent people ignore BUT, in this pathetic unprecedented situation that our country is in today, it would be a SACRILEGE TO IGNORE!!!

China says it is not ?becoming a supplier of political instability?
	
 China has rejected claims that it is ?becoming a supplier of political instability? and sets a ?debt-trap? for Sri Lanka and other countries.
In response to an editorial of the FT newspaper in London, Spokesman for the Chinese Embassy in the UK, Zeng Rong stated that ?By 2017, China?s loans to Sri Lanka accounted for only about 10 per cent in Sri Lanka's foreign debts, while Japan accounts for 12 per cent?and the Asian Development Bank 14 per cent. It is not tenable to claim that China?s loans are causing problems for Sri Lanka.?
The statement also stated;
I can?t agree with the comments in your editorial ? Sri Lanka turmoil points to China?s increasing role? (November 16) that China is ?becoming a supplier of political instability? and sets a ?debt-trap? for Sri Lanka and other countries.
China and Sri Lanka have long been friendly neighbours that always support each other in their major and core interests. The co-operation between the two countries is win-win and mutually beneficial. Such co-operation has delivered tangible benefit to the people of Sri Lanka. By the end of 2017, Chinese companies had completed more than $15bn worth of infrastructure projects in Sri Lanka in transportation, water, electricity, ports and other fields, giving a strong boost to its economic development.
The Puttalam Power Station provided about 40 per cent of the nation?s electricity supply, reducing the power price by 25 per cent. The completion of Colombo-Katunayake Expressway has brought great convenience to travellers and contributed to local tourism. The Colombo International Container Terminal, a China-Sri Lanka joint venture, enhanced the overall operational capacity of the Port of Colombo. According to the Port Connectivity Index compiled by Drewry (UK based shipping and maritime consultancy), the Port of Colombo ranked 13th in the world and number one in South Asia in 2017.
The Colombo Port City under construction and the Hambantota Port and Industrial Zone are expected to become the new powerful engines for Sri Lanka?s economic take-off. Furthermore, China-Sri Lanka pragmatic co-operation has created more than 100,000 jobs for Sri Lanka and trained tens of thousands of technical and management personnel.
China is not competing with any country to seek so-called regional dominance. China-Sri Lanka co-operation is equal and mutually beneficial. It is not targeting any third party or setting a ?debt trap?. By 2017, China?s loans to Sri Lanka accounted for only about 10 per cent in SriLanka?s foreign debts, while Japan accounts for 12 per cent?and the Asian Development Bank 14 per cent. It is not tenable to claim that China?s loans are causing problems for Sri Lanka.

Defiant PM is mauled from all sides of Parliament
	
The Prime Minister ran the gauntlet of MP anger in the House of Commons this afternoon, as she was mauled from politicians in all parties? ?
?
Theresa May was mauled by MPs from all sides, as she pleaded with them to back her Brexit deal and not to send Britain ?back to square one? in the crunch negotiations.? ?
The Prime Minister was given a furious grilling by MPs for over two and a half hours in the Commons as she made her latest desperate bid to win over critics after sealing the package at an EU summit over the weekend.? ?
Despite looking on track for a catastrophic defeat in a crunch vote in Parliament next month, Mrs May told MPs they had a ?duty? to listen to constituents and do ?what is in the national interest?.? ?
But she faced a barrage of attacks from all sides of the House, including from Tory big-hitters Boris Johnson, David Davis and Iain Duncan Smith.? ?
Tory MPs told their leader her deal is ?as dead as a dodo? and does not stand a chance of getting passed when it is voted on by the Commons on December 11 after a marathon five-day debate.? ?
The DUP - whose ten MPs prop the Tories up in No10 - again condemned the backstop, while Jeremy Corbyn said the package pleased ?nobody?.? ?
Even previous loyalists such as ex-Cabinet minister Sir Michael Fallon joined in the criticism.? ?
Extraordinarily, it took over an hour of brutal attacks from across the chamber before the first MP - Nicky Morgan - spoke in defence of Mrs May.?
?
At one point during the battering, Mrs May ruefully remarked to Conservative Remainer Anna Soubry that she barely seemed to have achieved one task that people claimed was ?impossible? before they were demanding she completed another one.? ?

## Title: Environment and Politics

Environment and Politics
	
Environmental Politics is a subset of National Politics. This is true for Sri Lanka as it is for other countries. Perhaps more so in Sri Lanka, because here the political sphere dominates all other spheres of activity and most often, not in a salutary fashion. Here in the environment is a mere commodity to be sold, bartered, de-valued, de-based and even de-gazzetted, as in the case of even National Parks which should remain sacrosanct as far as the government is concerned.?
The environment in question being protected forests, other forest lands and any other natural eco-system type, whether it be marshlands, mangroves or Patana grasslands that are in the custodianship of State agencies such as the Forest Department and the Department of Wildlife Conservation, and District Secretariats etc. These lands don?t belong to the Government in office, they are in State custodianship and held in trust for the people?in perpetuity.
This then challenges the assumption that politicians, other policy makers at Ministry level, as well as departments and other State agencies can do as they please with these lands, without first consulting the people. Steering committees on projects where civil society organisations are represented are ineffective, if the project proponents and project implementers as well as EIA consultants are one and the same, or are hand in glove; and civil society organisations can only rubber stamp the project or step aside by way of protest. Increasingly this is the trend and there is only one word for it: corruption. The rot at the heart of government, cannot but trickle down to ministries and departments over time.
Sri Lanka needs a sea change in the way the environment is viewed. An absolute paradigm shift is needed. Once felled, many forests are gone forever as the humus layer and topsoil gets quickly washed away by monsoon rain and thereafter the degraded soil supports only grasses, sedges, invasive plants and thorny scrub. A millennia (one thousand years) may elapse before such land once again supports a closed canopy forest (provided the land is left fallow and the vegetation is allowed to regenerate following natural succession of plants) However in the new forest, the species composition will differ substantially. This is true of our dry zone, but our wet zone and montane forests, once lost will be gone forever. Severe erosion of the exposed land, the change in soil Ph values, as well as the high endemicity, scarcity and fragmentary nature of such forests make them especially vulnerable.?
An absolute paradigm shift is needed. Once felled, many forests are gone forever as the humus layer and topsoil gets quickly washed away by monsoon rain and thereafter the degraded soil supports only grasses, sedges, invasive plants and thorny scrub
With the loss of such forest cover we as a nation lose all the eco-system services they provide. These are not renewable resources; not in our lifetime or even in the lifetime of our grand children can we expect these forests to regenerate. The further loss of forest cover will adversely affect the lives of every man woman and child in this island nation. Whenever elections are held in this near anarchic country, I urge you to look at the environmental track record of the candidate and the party and vote accordingly. Do not be fooled by promises that will be made (from election platforms): those promises and pledges have been broken so many many times: meanwhile we will grow thin on a steady diet of slick slogans, specially around election time.

Eradicating drug abuse and illicit trafficking
	
?Drug? is a substance which is especially addictive and hallucinogenic i.e. something causing illusion. It is a chemical people use to enjoy pleasant and exciting feelings. In many countries the use of such drugs is illegal while other drugs which are of medicinal value and not harmful are?not illegal.?
According to Buddhism one should abstain from intoxicants, drugs, alcohol and smoking in order to protect and observe ?Pansil? (Five moralities).? ?Surameraya majjapama datthana veramani sikkhapadan samadhiyami? is the last of the five moralities. Though it is the last of the five moralities it is equally important as the other four moralities. As pointed out by the Enlightened One, the ill effects of drugs is obvious and well-known to everyone in the society; including the very users of drugs or drug addicts. Drug addicts are aware of the suffering they had undergone, presently undergoing and will have to undergo in the future. They expect to enjoy pleasant and exciting feelings. They themselves are aware of the fact that such feelings are invariably temporary. They are also fully aware of the suffering they have to undergo physically, mentally, socially culturally, economically and in various other ways.? Most of the drug addicts admit that they are suffering, but yet for all they are reluctant to find and follow effective ways of getting over it. Most of the drug addicts try to find solace by repeatedly using drugs. ?One who has fallen into a well should come out of the mouth of the same well? they say? Thus they keep on using drugs and ruin themselves and very often end in misery and disaster.
Drugs under control?
The United Nations office on drugs and crime and its campaign only focus on drugs subject to control as specified in multi lateral drugs treaties that form the backbone of the international control system. These illicit drugs include amphetamine type stimuli or synthetic stimulant drugs -Cocaine, Cannabis, Hallucinogens, Opiates and sedative hypnotics.? In addition to these in our own country there are various kinds of locally manufactured illegal drugs such as Kasippu, Ganja, Bhang and Karingnan. Further various kinds of illegal drugs are smuggled into the country.? ?
Cocaine use in Western Europe is of particular concern where the consumption is reaching alarming levels. Cannabis, which is grown and used all over the world,?is challenging
Gravity of the problem
According to the information available nearly two hundred million people throughout the world are using illegal drugs ? Cannabis, Marijuana, Amphetamine and Methamphetamine type stimulants. Globally an estimated sixteen million people use opiates ?opium morphine heroin synthetic opiates and some thirteen million people use cocaine. The number of persons using drugs is likely to be much more as there can be many who had not been reckoned in surveys.
Cocaine use in Western Europe is of particular concern where the consumption is reaching alarming levels. Cannabis, which is grown and used all over the world, is challenging. The drug?s potency is being increased in recent years and there are indications that Cannabis related mental health may have been under estimated.? Opiate use along trafficking routes originating from Afghanistan, the world?s highest opium producer is the highest in the world.
Controlling mind and body? ? ?
It is crystal clear that no individual family or community is safe if drugs take control of even a single member of such a family or the community. Drugs control the body and mind of individual consumers.? Drug crop and drug cartels control the farmers. Illicit trafficking of drugs is the other serious problem. In a bid to earn more money farmers tend to engage in Marijuana farming and in the production of other kinds of drugs. In Sri Lanka Ganja is planted in thick forests, rugged terrains and and other accessible lands. In spite of raids conducted by the police,? the dangerous Drugs Control Board, the Excise Department etc. drugs production, illicit trafficking, distilling of Kasippu, pot Arrack etc. and other illegal acts relating to drugs including illicit trafficking of drugs are being carried out.?
Human trafficking
In the past underprivileged people were engaged in forced labour? ?by the privileged and affluent classes. At present millions of people are probably suffering due to human trafficking - the modern day slavery. Human trafficking is taking place in all corners of the world in spite of legal provision against it, According to the reports of the United Nations Office on drugs and crime victims from one hundred and twenty seven countries undergo human trafficking. In one hundred and thirty nations human trafficking is a profitable business. The United Nations and other experts estimate the total market value of human trafficking to thirty two Billion American Dollars.
Most of the drug addicts admit that they are suffering, but yet for all they are reluctant to find and follow effective ways of getting over it. Most of the drug addicts try to find solace by repeatedly using drugs
Tackling the problem
This is a global issue and any individual Government cannot deal with this problem alone. With this view in mind the United Nations General Assembly adopted a political declaration on the global drug problem. Its initial statement is as follows:? ?Drugs destroy lives and communities, undermine human development and generate crime. Drugs affect all sections of the society in all countries. In particular drug abuse affects the freedom and development of young people- the world?s most valuable asset.
Three ?P? s in the U.N. Protocol?
The United Nation?s protocols to prevent, suppress, and punish trafficking in persons; especially women and children came into force in 2008. The U N O D C Executive Director, Antonin Maria Costa once said ?Political will is growing as evidenced by the increasing number of countries that have ratified the UN protocol against trafficking of persons. The thematic debate is focused on the three ?P? s of the protocol of the protocol-preventing, protection and prosecution. It is built on the momentum generated by the first ever global forum held in Vienna in February 2008 by UN global initiative to fight human trafficking. That forum brought together 1,200 Government and civil society representatives as well as celebrities, philanthropists ?those who love the human kind, the media, parliamentarians, business leaders and faith based organisations from 166 countries to launch an unprecedented? ?global effort to eradicate the menace of drug abuse.?
In order to have an accurate picture of the true extent? of the crime a data collection exercise has been undertaken to collect data relating to trafficking routes trafficker profiles and vulnerable? groups and regions. The slogan of the U N O D C anti drugs campaign is ?Drugs control your life and your community. There is no place for drugs?.?
Prevention is to stop something from happening or to stop someone from doing something. Hence, prevention of drug production is to stop the production of drugs. For that purpose someone should stop the activities of drug production.? Drug producers should either be persuaded to stop or forced to stop such activities. To persuade someone to stop drug production activities the ill effects of drug production activities should be explained and emphasised to the culprits.? The ill effects are numerous as have already been pointed out.? The drugs produced by them ruin the lives of the users, their families and the whole society including the younger generation.? However, it is not a simple task to persuade the drug producers of the need to put an end to the production of drugs. It is a profitable business venture which they will not give up for the sake of others who are their customers. Trafficking in drugs and human trafficking are even more profitable and those who are involved in such activities will make all efforts to continue with such activities regardless of the impending disaster.
Protection is the act of keeping something or someone safe so that he, she or it is not harmed or damaged. In this instance protection means the measures to be taken to save the people, especially the young generation without being ruined from drug addiction. Parents, teachers, social workers and the community as a whole are responsible to ensure that no child is allowed to get addicted to drugs. Vulnerable individuals or those who are likely to get addicted to drugs should be identified and diverted on to the correct path. Addiction should be nipped in the bud. This should be done initially at home and the school by parents and teachers. Children should be directed to virtuous ways of living. Parents should not allow their children access to illicit drugs. Very often drug addiction originates from smoking. Hence, youngsters can be saved from drug addiction by not allowing them to get into the habit of smoking. Getting involved in sports and good habits and the association with good and sincere friends will pave the way for children to the correct path.?
Trafficking in drugs and human trafficking are even more profitable and those who are involved in such activities will make all efforts to continue with such activities regardless of the impending disaster
Protection and assistance? ? ?
Drug addicts need assistance and guidance to recover. They may be brainwashed in attempts made to find solutions for their problems themselves.? Thus they should be protected from being ruined.? ?
Punishing incorrigible culprits
Drug addicts who cannot be directed onto the correct path,? offenders of drug production, trafficking in drugs and human traffickers should be severely punished. New laws should be introduced in addition to the existing ones to punish the offenders.

FB admits 'serious mistake' in not removing racial hatred post in SL
	
A Facebook executive has admitted that the company ?made a mistake? in not removing a post that incited racial hatred in Sri Lanka, an international hearing on fake news and disinformation in London heard on Tuesday (Nov 27).
Mr Richard Allan, Facebook's vice-president of policy solutions, was questioned by Singapore Member of Parliament Edwin Tong over a post, written in Sinhalese in March, which called for the killing of all Muslims. Mr Tong asked if the post breached the social media company?s terms of service.
Mr Allan agreed it did.
?It was put up at a time when there were significant tensions between the people of Sri Lanka and Muslims, causing damage to property, deaths even. Riots. Damage to mosques. And eventually it resulted in the Sri Lankan government declaring a state of emergency. Would you agree?? Mr Tong said.
Mr Allan replied: ?Yes.?
?Would you agree that in the context of that kind of tensions occurring in Sri Lanka, putting up such a post would invariably travel far, divide those tensions, or stress those tensions even more, and divide the community?? asked Mr Tong.
Mr Allan replied: ?Yes, that?s high-priority content for us to remove.?
When Mr Tong asked why Facebook refused to take down the post in question, even after it was highlighted by Sri Lanka?s communications minister, Mr Allan said it was a ?simple error" on the part of a Facebook employee.
At this point, Mr Tong interjected. He argued it was no mistake and Facebook had replied to a user that the post does not go against its community standards.
Mr Allan disagreed. ?That was a mistake,? he said. ?I just want to be clear that somebody has made a mistake in the review.?
He also disagreed with Mr Tong?s subsequent query on whether this case showed that Facebook ?cannot be trusted to make the right assessment? on what can appear on its platform.
?We make mistakes ? serious mistakes; our responsibility is to reduce the number of mistakes,? he said.
?We are investing very heavily in artificial intelligence, where we would precisely create a dictionary of hate speech terms in every language.?
He added: ?The best way to resolve this is a dictionary of hate speech terms in Sinhalese, which gets surfaced to a Sinhalese-speaking reviewer, who can make sure that we do the job properly.?
Mr Tong replied: ?Mr Allan, in this case, whilst one excuse might be that your users or your reviewers don?t understand Sinhalese, when you have the communications minister of Sri Lanka telling you that this is hate speech and to take it down, and you review it, your people review it, and you said hundreds of thousands of people review it, but they don?t seem to abide by the same philosophy as you have expressed in your own policies.?
The post was only stopped from circulating after the Sri Lankan government blocked Facebook.
When Mr Tong asked if governments would have to resort to such measures to deal with the issue of deliberate online falsehoods, Mr Allan said Facebook would ?prefer not to?.
?This is where I think the openness has to be ? and I hope that you have a constructive relationship with my colleagues in Singapore who work in these issues,? said Mr Allan.
?I want us to be in a position where we share with you the good and the bad, about how we think we?re doing, in full expectation that you will be pushing us always to be better.?
To this response, Mr Tong replied: ?Well we look forward to that, because what?s happened, by way of example in Sri Lanka, and there are several others as well, should not be allowed to happen ever.?
Mr Allan said: ?No, and as an employee of Facebook I am ashamed that things like this happen and they do and they shouldn?t.?
ON FACEBOOK AND ELECTIONS
Mr Tong was joined by two fellow Members of Parliament from Singapore, Mr Pritam Singh and Ms Sun Xueling, at the hearing in London. Mr Singh asked Mr Allan what Facebook was doing to combat the prospect of elections from being ?tampered with?.
Mr Allan said that for ?every significant election?, Facebook now creates a ?war room? ? a task force consisting of specialists whose job is to understand the risks of that election and deploy the necessary tools and technology to deal with those risks.
Mr Singh asked if smaller countries would also fall under Facebook?s ?war room? concept.
?In an ideal world, it?s every election, everywhere, all of the time. Our current resourcing I think allows us to look at all national elections,? Mr Allan said.
?So if there?s a national election in Singapore, for example, that would be covered.?
He added: ?We had a similar task force around the Latvian election. So we are looking at every election whether the country is big or small, at a national level. And then the question is can we expand that also into regional and local elections.?
Mr Singh also asked if Facebook would consider working with local election authorities and political party representatives to remove or flag posts that would compromise the political process.
?We think that?s essential. And again I want to repeat ? the people who decide if an election is free and fair is you, and your authorities, and the political parties,? said Mr Allan.
?So we want to do, whatever is necessary in order for everyone to have the confidence that the election is free and fair - and we can?t do that on our own.
?We can make tools, we can work with you, but ultimately we need to engage with you in order to meet that shared objective that we contribute to positively rather than negatively to the election in your country.? Source: CNA/rw(cy)

Finance Ministry clarifies
	
The Finance Ministry yesterday rejected reports that Finance Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa had forced the customs department to release a person who had attempted to smuggle out US dollars amounting to 53,455 from the country.
The amount of dollars had been confiscated by the customs from an Iranian and the money is said to be the salary received by the Iranians who work under the Uma Oya project.
The Iranians are taking home their salary in this way due to the non-transaction between Sri Lankan and Iranian banks and Iranian Ambassador had made a request to allow these Iranian workers to take home their salary in this way on sympathetic grounds.
Accordingly, Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa in his capacity as the Finance Minister had instructed the customs to return the money to the Iranian, the Finance Ministry said. It also said that this was not the first time the Iranians took money to their country in this way and in a similar incident another Iranian national was also given back his confiscated money in June this year during the former Finance Minister's tenure

Minister Udaya Gammanpila today wrote to the Editor of the Hansard over an alleged distortion of the Parliamentary Affairs on November 14.
The Opposition MPs handed over a No-Confidence Motion to the Speaker on November 14 and Speaker announced that the motion was passed.
In a letter to the Editor, the Minister said what had happened on November 14 after the debate on the No-Confidence Motion was held, should be reported as of Speaker saying he would take up the vote by voice.
?Speaker also said there was no majority for the new Government. In his words, the Speaker said ?There is no majority for that?.
However, the phrase ?There is no majority for that? has been altered as ?There is no majority for them?.
Meanwhile, a new phrase ?The motion is carried? had also been included,? he said in the letter.
He requested the Editor to look into these ?Alterations? and to make necessary amendments to the Hansard.(Lahiru Pothmulla)

There is a white-collar high-up whom some in political circles brand as ?a queer one? these days.
?
This character holds a very high office which has assumed greater significance in the context of the ongoing Constitutional crisis in the country.
This white-collar high-up would call every political party leader in the country and tell him:
?Sir, I am sick of this job.? What could you say about my predicament?? Just tell me what I should do! I will do it!?
He is said to be calling at regular intervals, the former Number Two, the current Number Two and even another prominent figure in the R-family.
After being convinced that the character is nutty, all political party leaders have stopped answering his calls, they say.? Meanwhile, the lesser mortals of the office of this white-collar high-up have already apprised the current Number Two of the dead ropes he had given to various political leaders.

Honourable Justices of the Supreme Court: It?s not a slogan Make Sri Lanka sane again
	
?In individuals, insanity is rare; but in groups, parties, nations and epochs, it is the rule.?~Friedrich Nietzsche
The dissolution of Parliament is once again being challenged before a Fuller Bench. This writer believes in and dedicated to the rule of law and unmitigated justice. The writer also has utmost reverence to those magnificent men and women who preside over the fate and destinies of many a man and woman, many an organization and many a company.
The Supreme Court cannot see things as they outwardly appear, it needs to go further into the interior
	The infamous dissolution will again be before the Supreme Court which will consist of seven judges
	the Accommodation of one party should not be viewed by the other as a sign of weakness
	If the Supreme Court decides against, he must most politely and humbly accede to the decision
Those who sit in eventual judgment on a case firstly look at the facts of a case and secondly the law that applies to those what was revealed as facts before them. Most Honorable Justices of the Supreme Court, more often than not, have almost always delivered their judgments on the right side justice and on the right side of righteousness. Now the infamous dissolution of Parliament will again be argued for and against before the Supreme Court which will consist of seven, instead of the original three.
The Attorney General (AG), the Chief Law Officer of the Executive asked for a fuller bench, and he got it.
On December 7, 2018, the AG has to buttress his case for dissolution of Parliament. Definitions and intentions of the framers of the Constitution and its Chapters, Articles and Clauses, their validity in relation to the current impasse of governance and the political turmoil, the very act of dissolution as was demonstrated so vividly and in no unambiguous terms by some political ruffians who have been elected to Parliament, will all be argued before a fuller Bench of the Supreme Court. One couldn?t ask for a fairer resolution of the current crisis.
But one must be wiser. One must be more patient and even more accommodating. But that accommodation of one party should not be viewed by the other as a sign of weakness. There is space for accommodation. In politics, everything is possible. But there is no cure for pathological greed. Being avaricious is an intrinsic character of all beings. Humans are not spared of that quality. Yet society, in its evolution from the days of the Neanderthal, cave dweller of the prehistoric era, has developed both internal and external safeguards for the greater good of greater numbers against the grisly consequences of such avarice.
Rajapaksas, the former First Family (albeit their claim as the current one too), their close cohorts, some Parliamentarians who were elected in the 2015 August General Election and the majority of the media organizations in the country were all on a nauseatingly high ego-trip. Wresting the Premiership from the legitimate and rightfully elected owner of that position has given them some breathing room and they seem to be choking in their own breaths and sighs.
Having been in power for more than two decades and their proximity to the obscene luxuries and corrupt and powerful drawing rooms of more corrupt powerful politicos, shedding of that magic from their daily life is exceedingly hard; their natural tendencies to treat their constituents as serfs of that magical potion of power and their regular visits to their paramours have been made irregular and more difficult.
These negative effects of defeat at elections have driven them insane. That insanity was so demonstrably manifest in Parliament.
Insanity is a rotten symptom of a more dangerous ailment. Some of these Parliamentarians who behaved as if they were nearing their Armageddon of their political careers, truly made a sheer mockery of Parliamentary Traditions.
Left unto themselves, they must be utterly obnoxious men and women. What was granted to them, in most conventional and layman-terms, was uncommon and illegitimate. Whether it is also illegal and unconstitutional will be subject to the judicial decision of the seven-bench Supreme Court that will sit on December 7. Fraudulent and dishonest acts will have very adverse and nasty consequences, for both sides of any controversy.
The controversy of the dissolution of Parliament has totally gripped the country, its economy, its socio-political life and its Legislature. The resultant inactivity on the part of our government servants has surpassed their regular lethargy and complacency. During these days, they are glued to a television screen when Parliament is on the session.
Conversation is, sometimes exclusively, about who is jumping and who is not and from which side to which depends on the political allegiance of those who engage in such idol conversation. Insanity has set in among all those who are wishfully waiting for the reemergence of an era of corruption and family-rule. The sanity of regular men and women in our society is still intact.
Yet, that of our politicians of the Rajapaksa-clan is very much questionable. With their intelligence-upstairs ?to let?, a behaviour denoting a severe malignancy of some sort and countenance of that behaviour by their so-called leader are all part and parcel of symptoms which are much lesser in strength than the disease. The disease is much more incurable and more impenetrable even for an expert surgeon.
What has happened to our levels of intelligence? What has eaten into our skin that could prevent such demonic conduct, especially on the part of our political leaders?
People see the outer reaction and make their initial judgment. I?m sure such judgments are rarely wrong and seldom disputed. Distortion of what could be visible to the naked eye, such as saying that it?s Coca-Cola mixed with water that was thrown at Jayawickrama Perera was pathetic. If such dishonest and dishonourable conduct and utterances are really believed by those who committed the original sin, what another word one could describe such inhuman behaviour other than insane?
The common man has already made his judgment. He has arrived at a non-nuanced verdict. Devoid of late-night analysis and Monday morning-quarterbacking, the regular common man does not see any shades of uncertainty. He sees insanity as insanity; he sees right as right and wrong as wrong; no doubts and no second-guessing.
But the Supreme Court of the land cannot see things as they outwardly appear; they need to go further into the interior, penetrate the outer skin and go into the bone and marrow of arguments for and against and then decide whether the dissolution of Parliament on November 9, 2018, is Constitutional or not.
It has already suspended that dissolution and given time till December 7 to both parties to the decision to present arguments for their respective positions. Decisions of the Supreme Court are final. There are no appeals from the Supreme Court. There is no Crown above the Supreme Court. It is therefore supreme in every sense of the word.
The country is eagerly awaiting the verdict. It may be that one part of the controversy is the Chief executive of our country, President Maithripala Sirisena. But both the Supreme Court and Maithripala Sirisena must realize that it is not Maithripala Sirisena the private individual whose decision is at stake; it is the ruling of the President of this country and it is his ruling, the President?s ruling that is at stake.
Some Parliamentarians who behaved as if they were nearing their Armageddon of their political careers, truly made a sheer mockery of Parliamentary Traditions
The burden of leadership is so great that only those who dare to carry it without any favour or fervour could carry it to the end. Occupying that lonely abode of leadership should not be treated as a prize won after a competition. It is the weight that people place on him or her because they themselves cannot carry it. Such challenges and harsh burdens are indeed an enormous privilege.
Such privileges should be treated as such- privileges and challenges. Greatness has summoned Maithripala Sirisena, the President. If the Supreme Court decides against his decree to dissolve Parliament, he must most politely and humbly accede to the decision and leave the matter at the hands of the Legislature.
If the Legislature takes the decision, even under the most difficult and unbelievable circumstances, that decision needs to be carried out without favour or fervour.
Therein resides the gravity of the Supreme Court. Annals of our court system have not seen a decision of such magnitude and scope, a decision of such weight and burden and a decision of such historic consequence and legacy. The Justices will be remembered for the decision they render on the dissolution of Parliament. This decision will be their legacy. The decision to make Sri Lanka sane again is one of supreme consequence.

Judiciary being dragged into ongoing conflict: Dullas
	
UPFA MP Dullas Alahapperuma yesterday said the judiciary is being dragged into the ongoing conflict between the Executive and the Legislature.
He said convening of parliament when two cases are pending in the Supreme Court over the dissolution of parliament was one example of judiciary being dragged into this conflict.
?The parliament, which represents the supremacy of the people, did not even have an agenda when the session commenced on Tuesday. The content of the court cases are being distorted by convening parliament. This is an attempt of dragging Judiciary into the current conflict,? the MP said, speaking at a news briefing held at the Prime Minister?s Office.
Meanwhile, he said there were previous examples where speakers of parliament had allowed the government to give majority representation in the Committee of Collection in Parliament.
?When W.J.M. Loku Bandara was appointed Speaker in 2004, he allocated 14 slots out of the 23 to the UPFA government. Speaker Chamal Rajapaksa assigned nine slots out of 15-member PSC to the UNP led unity government in 2015. This is the tradition ,? he said.
He also said the people should be allowed to make a decision about the governing party of the country at this moment. ?The General Election is the only solution,? he said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

Lifesaver cop who denied the ?sea monster? 150 lives
	
There is a police officer attached to the Police Life Saving Unit who was awarded with the ?Virujana Silver Mudrikawa? at the 23rd Virujana Award Ceremony held recently.?
This Police Officer has gained the needed experience to become a lifeguard from the areas associated with hydraulic civilization tank systems as well as Dandugama Oya in Seeduwa. As a result, he had been awarded with the above award for the adventurous task performed by him risking his life during the 32 years of serving Sri Lanka Police. While working as a lifeguard of Sri Lanka Police he had saved about 150 people who were about to fall victim to the rough sea.
This officer who brought honour to Sri Lanka Police is Sergeant? A.W.A.Don Nihal Sarath Kumara (56). He is at present engaged in duty in the coastal area of Eththukala.?
He is the fifth in a family of 10 and was born in Kotarupe in Raddoluwa. His father was a school principal. His mother was a teacher. Sarath Kumara who gained his education from Raddolugama Maha Vidyalaya and Thambuththegama Vidyalaya joined Kalutara Police Training College as a trainee Police constable on June 10, 1984.?
When delving into his lifesaving task, it was during his student years that he first saved a life. That was the life of a lady. She was saved by him from being drowned in Dandugama oya. In the meantime, he has won the bronze medal and obtained the training certificate following the completion of his training in 1987. He has represented Ratnapura Police Division at 1985-86 Police Inter-Division Swimming Tournament. These achievements inspired him to render a valuable service to the country in latter years.?
Often he was alone?
He has served in many areas in the coastal belt of the country. He has also served where there are rivers and tanks and also during festive occasions as a life guard. He has performed the task of saving lives of the people who live near reservoirs and rivers. He has also performed duties on poya holidays in places like Anuradhapura, Kandy and Yovunpura. On such occasions he was able to save about 150 lives while being engaged in lifesaving. He has also saved lives in the Wellawatta, Mt.Lavinia, Hikkaduwa, Eththukala, Kirinda and Talawila sea belts. Something special about his life saving feats is that about 100 lives were saved without anybody?s assistance.?
In addition to his above feats, he has chipped in with his contributions which came in the form of training school children to swim in Kalu Ganga. This was when he was performing his duties in Ratnapura and Balangoda areas.?
He was awarded with the ?Virujana Silver Mudrikawa? on September 25, 2007 at a ceremony organised by Vira Podujana Peramuna. This ceremony was held under the patronage of the Speaker Karu Jayasuriya and the then State Minister of Defence Ruwan Wijewardena. The award was presented considering the adventurous task performed by him risking his life and saving the lives of six persons. These people were about to drown in the sea.?
In the meantime he also received the ?Derana Viru? Award as well. Sarath Kumara has received more than hundred good remarks due to his performances as a lifeguard.? He has been held in high esteem on two occasions by the Inspector General of Police. He emerged as the winner of the? swimming championships held in Ratnapura and Vavuniya.?
In response to a question asked by this writer as to how he developed his swimming skills, Sarath Kumara said, ? I attended schools all over the country while living with my dad. I got the opportunity to excel in swimming thanks to Dandugama Oya in my village and the tanks scattered in many areas in the country. While I was playing volleyball during my school time, I was able to save a life of a lady. I was also able to help in removing two bodies of those who had drowned? in Dandugam Oya.?
He added that he was able to bring Sri Lanka Police under the spotlight under the directions of Senior SP Chulasiri and SP Piyadasa Silva after joining the law enforcement department. According to him, he had faced a dreadful experience when he tried to save twelve lives in Kirinda. He took this opportunity to thank his fellow police officers who had helped him shine as a lifeguard.?
In conclusion, he said that he had decided to engage in ordinary police duties during the three years left in his career in Sri Lanka Police.? (Courtesy Lankadeepa)

Making predictions to suit the aspirations!
	
?
A prominent green party stalwart confided in a businessman buddy his desire to consult a reputed astrologer in a neighboring part of the neighboring country. And the businessman lost no time in arranging for the astrologer to quietly visit the politico?s residence in the city.
?
The astrologer perused the politico?s horoscope and assured him of the presence of a powerful Rajayoga and the appropriate time of its fruitification had had almost arrived. The astrologer left for his hotel suite after advising the politico that it was time for him to aim at the highest position in the country.
Meanwhile, a confidante of a very high political authority learnt that the well-known astrologer had come to read the horoscope of the green party high-up with a two-letter first name and in a bid to win some brownie points from the high political authority went into action to provide an opportunity for the latter to consult the visiting astrologer.
After reading the political authority?s horoscope, the astrologer told him:
?Sir, you have been born to shine as a great man! Time of greater glory is just ahead of you!?
Collecting a hefty fee from the high political authority as well, the astrologer hastily left the country avoiding any more consultations, they say.

Maldives top court clears Nasheed of terror conviction

COLOMBO AFP Nov26, 2018 - The Maldives top court overturned a terrorism conviction on Monday against the country?s first democratically elected leader Mohamed Nasheed, who fled into exile after being sentenced to 13 years behind bars.? ?
The Supreme Court said Nasheed was wrongfully charged and should not have been convicted in the 2015 trial described by the United Nations as politically motivated.? ?
Nasheed went into exile a year later while abroad seeking medical treatment, and was branded a fugitive from justice.? ?
??President Nasheed?s entire trial was a politically-motivated sham,? his lawyer, Hisaan Hussein, said after his conviction was quashed.? ?
??It is appalling that an innocent man was unjustly forced to spend a year in jail, 35 months in exile, and was prevented from standing for political office.? The opposition icon only returned to the Maldives this month after his political rival Abdulla Yameen, who ruled the Maldives with an iron fist for five years, was beaten in a presidential election.? ?
The strongman president jailed or exiled most of his opponents but since he departed office political prisoners have been freed and opponents abroad have returned.? ?

Specializing in outsourcing, Soraya Saldin ?

According to him, the IT professional is unfamiliar to the recruitment industry as the industry they specialize in itself.
Understanding that particular mindset and pairing them with the best choice of career is a process that needs to be handled with much responsibility. ?We also want to encourage IT professionals to remain in Sri Lanka rather than opting to leave the country,? he added further.
The latest venture of the Mankind Group is HR Solutions (Pvt) Ltd, the training arm, which is currently focused on providing qualitative training programs for clients to develop their most valuable asset - their employees.The vision at HR Solutions (Pvt) Ltd. is to developemerging leaders and to contribute to the corporate sector by bringing out the best in People, through training.

Offer to come in another guise!
	
The top men of the new regime have not given up the idea of hooking some green members at whatever cost despite opening a can of worms with audio clips containing voice- cuts relating to political horse-trading going public.
?
Wiser by experience, they have now decided to give up the ?direct approach? and fall back upon more discreet methods to hook a few greens to clear the ?113? hurdle.
They have felt that the most effective method is to approach the ?targets? through the better-half because they believe that womenfolk are more susceptible to the allure of high status and a luxury lifestyle and are usually not much concerned about ethics or party principles.
They have thought of a modus operandi like this:? A decoy-Diyawanna member would phone up a ?target? Green colleague and say: ?I am paying a visit to your locality regarding a personal matter. I thought of dropping at your place on my way back?!?
However, the Green bigwigs have already got wise to the latest strategy being employed to hook their members and are now on the watch out for the type of guests being entertained by their members these days, they say.

One is shying away when the other is eyeing it!
	
?
The green party is gearing up the party machinery for a general poll these days.
?
Some party seniors and a sizable segment of the rank and file are looking up to Deputy Saji to provide the leadership to the party?s election campaign. But he is shying away from this responsibility, they say.
However, there is a sibling of a former party heavyweight quite eager to play the lead role in the party and a group of green backbenchers is already giving him a push.
Meanwhile, some party sources close to this ambitious sibling say his dream is to secure the more powerful Number Two position conceding the Number One place to Deputy Saji.

Optimistic of securing a majority for VoA: Vasu
	
The Government today said it was optimistic that a majority of MPs would vote to pass the Vote on Account (VoA) as it was a matter of national interest.
Minister Vasudeva Nanayakkara said if the VoA had any relevance to the MPs and the MPs were interested in the VoA, they would vote for it irrespective of political differences.
?The VoA is not a political issue but a matter which affects the entire country. It is about the expenditures of the country. The MPs will vote for it based on the effect the VoA will have on them. If the VoA was defeated, the Government will lose as per the standard,? he said at a news briefing held at Prime Minister?s Office.
He said they will present the VoA to Parliament when the time was right after considering other facts such as the determination of the Supreme Court on Parliament dissolution.
Meanwhile, he said they hoped to pass a resolution in Parliament to expunge all Hansard reports which were published since November 14 since the Parliament had been dissolved by the President prior to that day.(Lahiru Pothmulla)

Our political culture is on default mode Lawyer Harshana Nanayakkara
	
Mr. Harshana Nanayakkara is an outspoken lawyer who believes an honest, just and well-planned form of governance is key to developing Sri Lanka. To achieve this, he and his colleagues at the National Intellectuals? Organization (NIO) have launched an ambitious programme to formulate a National Plan to seek long-term solutions to the social, political and economic issues facing the people of Sri Lanka. Mr. Nanayakkara comes from a well-known family, and is the son of film-maker Yasapalitha Nanayakkara and the nephew of Vasudeva and Hemakumara Nanayakkara, who have been prominent and somewhat controversial figures in national politics. Mr. Nanayakkara, who is also with ?Lawyers for Democracy?, spoke to Daily Mirror? on Sri Lanka?s current political crisis, and NIOs plans to implement their programme, and the groups and leaders they hope to work with to achieve their goals.
Our leaders never had long-term plans
	Our food security is at stake
	Trade agreements must benefit the country
	The major parties have businessmen and oligarchs backing them
	We want fair and just wealth distribution
	For some, the JVP is not ?posh? enough
	We stand for racial unity and harmony
	42 percent of the population earns under two dollars a day
	A super hero cannot magically uplift the economy
Q: You recently said that politicians use the Constitution like toilet paper. Why did you make such a hard-hitting statement?
The Constitution is our supreme law. All Public Servants and tri-forces members pledge to uphold it. Even the president is under obligation to uphold it. It?s our shared morality. It reflects who we are. President J.R Jayawardane didn?t become Executive President through an election. He used his Parliamentary majority to acquire these amazing powers. But the 19th Amendment curtailed these undemocratic powers and decentralized them to Parliament.?
Whenever our politicians do anything immoral or wrong, they seek loopholes in the Constitution to justify their acts. They interpret the country?s supreme law to justify their wrongdoings. This is why I said they use the pages of the Constitution to wipe the mess they?ve made through their wrong deeds.?
?
Q:?But haven?t successive governments violated the Constitution since Independence? Section 29(2) of the Soulbury Constitution which sought to protect minorities was disregarded. So were the 13th and 17th Amendments of the current Constitution. What is so significant about this moment?
Yes, every ruler tried to bend, twist, or dig a hole in the Constitution to suit their needs. And that?s wrong. But this is the first time the entire Constitution has been thrown into the dustbin. President Sirisena doesn?t even need the Constitution. He can run with a Gazette. The removal of the Prime Minister (PM) was unlawful and wrong. There?s no provision to dissolve Parliament unless four-and-a-half years has lapsed or two-thirds of Parliament agrees to it. That?s the spirit of the 19th Amendment. We stand for the rule-of-law and democracy. Ranil Wickremesinghe?s government introduced the 19th Amendment against the draconian powers of the Executive. That doesn?t mean I endorse them. They flouted their mandate, and I would like to see their end.
But thus far, governments had changed through elections or a shifting of heads in Parliament. This is the first time a government was overthrown through a conspiracy. In any other country there would have been a bloodbath. It almost happened here. Two people died in the Petroleum Corporation clash.??
?
Q:?You mention upholding democracy and ensuring the rule-of-law. Weren?t those, along with ending corruption, the main slogans in the 2015 January 8th campaign? In your estimate, where did things go wrong, and what were the warning signs??
In January 2015, the people were tired of the abuse of power and the undemocratic actions of the previous regime. They wanted corruption to end, for thieves to be caught, and for new leaders not to repeat the same crimes. People never asked for jobs or cheaper bread. They wanted democracy, rule-of-law and action against criminals. But the government failed miserably on these fronts.?
For three-and-a-half years no cases were filed, or anyone locked up. Ranil Wickremesinghe deliberately scuttled arresting people from the previous regime. In the Siriliya case, Shiranthi Rajapaksa went to the Speaker?s house to make a statement. And Cabinet decided to drop inquiries because it involved the former First Lady.?
After the bond case, Ranil is no longer ?Mr. Clean?. He brought in Arjuna Mahendran, and defended him. Even after the recent unlawful regime change, no one from the opposing camp is accusing him of the bond scam. Even the President, who insulted the LGBT community with the ?samanalaya? (butterfly) comment, didn?t mention this.?
The early warnings were when members of the previous regime were invited into the government. The organisation ?Aluth Parapura? was assaulted on the campaign trail, but Sirisena gave positions to the perpetrators. They were never committed to their mandate.
?
Q:?You say people didn?t want jobs, or bread. But weren?t economic issues, like the fuel pricing mechanism and the rising cost of living, a cause for the growing unpopularity of the Yahapalana government?
The main promises from the platform were about ending corruption and arresting criminals. Of course there are economic concerns. But they were not central to the government change. Under this government too prices will rise. Their economic vision is like that of a gambler, waking up each day and deciding what to sell. Did the Yahapalana government open a single factory? Where are the jobs they promised??
According to the Central Bank (CBSL), in 2017 we exported around 10 billion dollars in goods and services, including remittances from migrant workers, and tea and rubber exports. In return, we imported goods worth 20 billion dollars. That?s a trade deficit of 100 percent. We are not manufacturing what we can locally. The ocean surrounds us, but our tinned-fish is from Argentina and Chile. We even import dried fish. Our food security is at stake.?
Up to 1977, our economy could be sustained on tea, rubber and coconut. Since then, with the open economy and globalization, the economy expanded. But we never expanded. For example, when IT first came in the 1960s and 1970s, India trained its IT professionals. But we introduced IT as an A? Level subject only in 2014. We lack economic vision.?
?
Q:?The global economy is experiencing the effects of the 2008 financial crash, and the rise of China. This has led to a power struggle between the US and China. In national politics, Mahinda Rajapaksa is seen as being pro-China, and Ranil Wickremesinghe as being pro-US.?
I believe both of them are pro-China now (laughs).?
?
Q:?My question is, how can a small country like Sri Lanka handle this US-China power struggle within a complex and tumultuous global economy?
We have willingly offered ourselves to be a victim of this power struggle, by not having a national plan or vision. In this global age, countries depend on each other. Having a closed economy is not the answer. An open economy is required. It?s fine to enter into international trade agreements, but they must benefit the country.?
I recently read that the country has lost 19,000 million dollars due to corruption and theft. With no money to produce food, we are forever dependent on the world market. Certain essential items, like fuel, medicine and vehicles, must be imported. But there are many items that can be produced locally. The major parties have businessmen and oligarchs backing them. So the economy functions to benefit them, and not the public. It?s not the fault of China or America. The economy must be able to withstand the shocks of world prices. That can be achieved only through strengthening the local economy.?
We are 70 percent dependent on agriculture. So we need proper technology to increase the yield. We get only 40 - 45 bushels of paddy per acre, but Japan gets 100 bushels. We must research into seeds that can withstand droughts and floods.?
There are global contenders for our resources, and if careless, we can become a dumping ground for inferior goods. Trade agreements must be re-drafted to develop our local economy. Our biggest resource is our people. They must be educated. Instead of exporting domestic workers, we should export doctors and engineers. That will bring us more value.?
?
Unless people change how they think, we cannot change the governments we get
Q:?Certain groups have advocated building a new political movement. Even you, as a member of the National Intellectuals? Organization (NIO), have gone on record saying this.?
That?s correct.
?
Q:?What do you intend when you say ?we must build a new political movement??
The people are tired of politics. Though governments change, they feel all politicians are the same. Since 1948, only a few families have ruled this country. The Bandaranaikes? Horagolla Walauwa ruled for 15-20 years, the Senanayakes? Botale Walauwa ruled for 10-15 years. Then the Kollupitya Walauwa of Jayawardane and Wickremesinghe ruled us, and finally the Rajapaksas? Medamulana Walauwa. So we have been ruled according to the whims of a few aristocratic families.?
Our leaders never had long-term plans. They did the minimum to satisfy people, and secure their votes. All economic development was done for this limited purpose.?
Look at our political culture. You saw how MPs? behaved in Parliament recently. Some say we must elect only educated people. But among the unruly MPs were doctors and lawyers. It?s decency that matters, not education.?
So, our political culture is on default mode ? that is, politicians will stay and there?s nothing we can do about it. This is the mindset the NIO wants to change. Unless people change how they think, we cannot change the governments we get.?
The NIO has set up several committees comprising academics, professionals and Public Servants into areas like agriculture, art, sport, religion, environment, and so on. Through island-wide workshops, we have gathered information from farmers and such, who?s knowledge isn?t in books or labs. Through this process we have identified societal issues that require long-term solutions. This National Policy document will be out in January, and it will act as a blueprint for development. NIO?s role is to facilitate a new political force devoid of corrupt and dishonest individuals, who will give us the necessary political leadership.
We want fair and just wealth distribution. We have enough national wealth, but it?s not distributed fairly. We are taxed 30-40 percent through indirect taxation. Leaders steal from the Treasury to indulge in luxuries, and the public pays through taxes. People will pay taxes if they get proper services. Countries like Denmark have the highest tax rates, but they get free education, good public transport, and free medicine.??
?
Q:?But is it fair to compare a former colonized country like Sri Lanka with a struggling economy, to a wealthy European country like Denmark?
?If considering the detail of comparison, then it?s unfair. But I say they (Denmark) developed because there?s no corruption. Even if you compare resources, perhaps we are far better. It?s just that we aren?t utilizing them. Instead we sell them.??
The Hambantota port was originally planned as a service port. But thanks to China it became a loading-unloading terminal. Our leaders accepted the loan, and China gave it knowing we cannot repay it. That?s the Chinese system.?
?
Q:?You recently spoke on stage at the JVP rally in Nugegoda.?
Yes I did.
?
Q:?The JVP has a track record of supporting the major parties at different times. They also have a history of violence. What is your rationale for supporting the JVP? Aren?t they also very much to blame for the current situation?
You can blame them for violence in 1971 and 1988-89. Even my father?s life was under threat in 1988-89. But since then, the only party that has not even thrown a stone, or broken a traffic law, is the JVP. There are no allegations of corruption against them. Their six MPs are extremely disciplined and efficient. At the last Local Government (LG) elections they got over 400 members. We see news of Pohottuwa and UNP LG members stealing, or harassing women, or involved in other crimes. But none of the 400-plus JVP members are accused of such wrongdoings. That?s due to the discipline set by the party leadership.?
The British ruled us for 200 years, and they did more damage than the JVP. But we still speak in English, and wear coat and tie. The past is the past. If they have changed for the better, especially when faced with such a political culture, then they are the option. That?s why I got on the JVP stage. They?re not corrupt. They are honest and have a vision. They have a plan.?
?
Q:?But they don?t have much electoral support.?
As I told you, people must change how they think. We tend to support leaders from aristocratic backgrounds. For some, the JVP is not ?posh? enough. And for others, they simply don?t get the JVP?s message.?
Remember, 42 percent of the population earns under two dollars a day. These people don?t have time to follow the news or discuss things over a cup of tea. They are content if someone gives them a cement bag, or some galvanized roofing sheets. This poverty and ignorance is being shamelessly exploited by the main parties. Even ?Gamperaliya? was about appeasing the public through handouts.?
The JVP doesn?t have money to buy people. So it is difficult for them to get electoral backing. But things are changing fast. We see it at the ground level. And at the next election we will answer your question very affirmatively.
?
Q:?You highlight how economic conditions, and other social and cultural factors, influence people?s voting habits. But another aspect of our culture is that of nationalism, be it Sinhala or Tamil nationalism. How much has nationalism impacted our political culture?
You say nationalism. I would say racism. Being nationalist is a good thing. It means you love your country, and you want to serve it. Being racist is the problem. And it?s relevant to both sides - the south and north.?
And politicians use people?s racial and nationalistic feelings for political gain. The master of this art is Mahinda Rajapaksa. I don?t think Ranil can come even close to him in that regard (laughs). Each time something goes wrong for Mahinda, we hear the ?koti nagitinawo? (the Tigers are rising) outcry. They thrive on that.?
This is why the Pohottuwa camp will not be able to achieve anything in this country. They operate by raising racial and nationalistic feelings within a Buddhist framework. But a proper Buddhist would never judge anyone by their race, caste or creed. The Buddha preached about this in the Wasala Suthraya. You have similar types like Mr. Vigneswaran in the north who is demanding federalism. But the TNA is ready to compromise for a unitary state.?
This country cannot be taken an inch forward if we think on racial and religious lines. The political movement the NIO seeks to create will not exploit racial or religious tensions to gain power. Even the JVP will be a component of it, and not the sole authority. We stand for racial unity and harmony. We will fight against racist, nationalist and extremist religious views from either side.? ? ? ?
?
Q:?There was a time when class politics featured prominently in our political discourse. This was later replaced by nationalistic politics. Today we hardly hear the term ?working-class?. Why is the working-class not being addressed in contemporary politics??
It is happening. But it depends on our perception of the working-class. People give various meanings to ideas of socialism, capitalism and the working-class. The socialism of 1917 Russia does not exist today.?
Before 1977, MPs? financial stability was not dependent on politics. Leaders like D.S. Senanayake, S.W.R.D Bandaranaike and even J.R. Jayawardane sold their private property to serve the public. The land-owning aristocrats could do this. At that time, the division between the working-class and the aristocracy was clear.?
But after 1977 there was a massive influx of the common man into Parliament. They were not land-owning aristocracy. This was a good thing, but it also changed our political culture. The new leaders wanted to imitate their aristocratic predecessors. They wanted to own elephants and horses. The aristocracy faded away, and was replaced by new-rich oligarchs. That?s when corruption began.?
Even now there?s a working-class. But they?re not only the factory worker, as commonly perceived. Even the white-collar worker is a worker. People have to either sell their labour, or their mind, to live. So in that sense there?s a massive working-class. So yes, there is a division, and the NIO has taken this into consideration. And the JVP has always sided with the working-class.?
?
Q:?You have given us an analysis from your perspective. But what solutions do you propose??
As I said earlier, the NIO is compiling a document to be released in January, which addresses different subject areas and provides solutions for them. But that plan must be put into action. Whatever system we put on paper, be it socialism, capitalism, or mixed-economy, the most important thing is the individuals who run it.?
Our country is failing mainly due to ongoing massive-scale corruption. The Auditor General has said it would take eight years to figure out how much we are in debt, and how to come out of this abyss.?
We can?t expect a super hero to magically uplift the economy in two years. We need honest policies, and workable actions. And above all honest people. Our action plan is open to everybody, not just the JVP. We urge all citizens to join us. With honest people, within the first five years we can set the country on the right track and ease many burdens.?
But, contrary to expectations, all problems cannot be fixed in five years. Some expect that. So they want a dictator. You need, not just one person, but a team of efficient, honest people with a plan. You need a good team. And that?s why we?re fond of the JVP. It?s not a party of heroes. It?s a party made up of a team.?

Peace and ethnic harmony through education
	
We believe the only way to bring about peace and harmony among the various religious and ethnic groups in Sri Lanka is via education.? ?
Motivated by the motto ?Educate, Empower, Transform?, we hope to create new learning environments and spaces where we hope to form a generation of young men and women who burn with the zeal for a new humanity. We aim to create a shared community of learners who journey together in companionship with one another, nature and the divine. Our desire is to form a community that transcends the physical walls and the barriers created by human limitations. The community we envision to serve is a community that becomes a counter-cultural sign in promoting peace, harmony?and reconciliation.??
We aim to start a programme that would also create opportunities for employment; this, is assured as the venture is a Public Private Programme done with the participation of Vocational Training Authority Sri Lanka (VTAS).??
The Loyola Campus (Joint Higher Education Sri Lanka: Education at the Margins) has signed a MoU with JWL (Jesuit Worldwide Learning) to collaborate and work together in providing best educational opportunities to those in the margins.??
While Loyola Campus is an independent entity of the Jesuits of Sri Lanka, it has recognized JWL as the preferred partner in providing several Certificate courses and a?diploma program.??
Loyola Campus Trincomalee is registered under Tertiary Vocational Education Commission (TVEC) and is in the process of obtaining National Vocational Qualification (NVQ) and in future intend to offer several (NVQ) courses as well. It being a charitable organization, one could donate as a CSR project and be covered on your tax returns.? ?

PM chosen by Parliament, not Prez-Ranil
	
Responding to a statement made by President Maithripala Sirisena that he will not appoint him as the Prime Minister again; UNP Leader Ranil Wickremesinghe yesterday said the President has to offer the post to anyone chosen by Parliament.
Mr. Wickremesinghe expressed this sentiment at a public rally in Kalutara last evening.
?Gone are the days when President was able to hand pick a Prime Minister. It is Parliament which has the power to appoint a Prime Minister under the 19th Amendment to the Constitution,? Mr. Wickremesinghe said.
?We have been following the British tradition since 1948 and had appointed the person who commands a majority in the House as the Prime Minister,? Mr. Wickremesinghe said.
?Former President Chandrika Kumaratunga told me that she will appoint me as Prime Minister in 2001 even though she does not want to do it. This, she said, she will do as I had a majority,? he added.
He said President Sirisena should have informed him in 2015 itself if he did not want to work with him. ?President could even have told Minister Rajitha Senaratne if he was not willing to work with me then. He should have at least mentioned it to members of his own party at that time,? Mr. Wickremesinghe said.
Mr. Wickremesinghe recalled that when President Sirisena asked him whether he was ready to resign after the local government election earlier this year he had told the President that both he and the President should take equal responsibility for the polls defeat and not him alone. The UNP Leader further said he never said he did not want to work with the SLFP after several of them voted in favour of the no-confidence motion against him.
UNP Deputy Leader Sajith Premadasa said he is willing to lay down his life for the sake of democracy just like the Speaker who stands up fearlessly for justice. (Yohan Perera)

Prez should take responsibility for de-stabilizing the country: JVP
	
While claiming that it was President Maithripala Sirisena who put the country into anarchy and instability for his political gains, the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) said today that he should take the responsibility of stabilizing the country as well.
JVP Politburo Member Sunil Handunnetti told a news conference that the country had faced a serious economic crisis and added that the country would have to face a financial crisis next year as there was no legitimate government to present a budget for next financial year.
?The budget cannot be passed without a Government. There are no funds to spend after December 31. We have to pay a loan instalment of US$ 1 billion before January 15 next year. The President should explain to the country how the pension, salary of public servants are paid after December 31,? he said.
He said the people had started to feel the repercussions of the purported government set up by the President Sirisena for his political gains.
?The rupee has deteriorated remarkably against the US dollar. The debt burden, prices of imported goods are increasing due to the depreciation of the rupee. The depreciation of the rupee is unbearable for the country?s economy. The Rajapaksa faction took over the power not to develop the economy,? he said.
Mr Hadunnetti said the share market had seriously collapsed where US$ 4.5 billion of foreign investments had been withdrawn from the share market in November. (Ajith Siriwardana)

President Maithripala Sirisena instructed the authorities to look into the possibility of introducing paying the fines for minor crimes including traffic offences through an Electronic Payment System.
The President instructed them to implement a speedy procedure with stringent rules to control crimes, drug smuggling and the underworld activities introducing necessary legal reforms.
He told them to examine the possibility of implementing a proper method while removing the existing outdated methods.
Following a special meeting at the President?s Secretariat special attention was drawn regarding minimizing road accidents.
?Even though the Department of Motor Traffic introduced a ?Point Based System? for drivers in 2009 with the aim of minimizing road accidents due to the technical problems, it has not been successful,? the President noted.
He scrutinized the progress of legal reforms in relation to the special procedure implemented with the assistance of the Tri- Forces on drug raids and instructed the Legal Draftsman?s Department to complete the task within the next two weeks.?(Sandun A Jayasekera)

## Title: Series of deaths Chilaw Gen. Hospital comes under the ?microscope?

Series of deaths Chilaw Gen. Hospital comes under the ?microscope?
	
Within a period of 10 days in the month of October, 2018 three neonatal deaths and one maternal deaths were reported from the Chilaw District General Hospital, raising concern as to whether something was seriously wrong in the medical set-up.?
Rasika Jeewani, a 34-year-old mother and her baby died on October 28. According to reports, her husband Aruna Priyanga says that she was in good health when she was admitted to the hospital. They had requested for a caesarean operation to deliver the baby, but the doctors had opted for normal delivery. Both mother and the baby had died later. Priyanga complains that the doctors had not considered their request and demands the authorities to do a handwriting test to determine whether the handwriting in the admission card was his wife?s. He says that his wife had requested a caesarean operation.? ?
Following the death of the mother and child, another neonatal death occurred. The baby of Tania Kalhari (21) died on November 04. The hospital authorities had claimed that the mother had diabetes and the condition led to the death of the baby. The next day, November 05, another baby died at the same hospital during delivery. This was the baby of Periyandi Wathani, a 30-year-old mother from Udappuwa in Arachchikattuwa. She had been admitted to the hospital on October 24 for the birth of her second child. Wathani?s baby was buried the next day, on November 06, without autopsy being performed.??
Following the three deaths and accusations made by the patients, the Acting Director of the hospital Dr. L. Poddalgoda told the media that he had admitted that the deaths were unusual. He had said that an investigation was underway to determine whether these deaths were caused by any germ or due to negligence of the staff.?
Investigation produces nothing?
The Daily Mirror spoke to the Acting Director, who said that they had conducted an investigation, but nothing was found. He said that one baby was immature and already dead at the time of delivery, while one of the others had died; due to what they believed was a congenital bleeding disorder. They had done two diagnoses to find the cause of death.?
Asked why the doctors had done a normal delivery when Jeewani, the mother, had signed for a c-section operation, the director said that usually most mothers requested for a caesarean while they were awaiting delivery. He said it was not the patient, but the consultant who had to decide whether to do a normal delivery or a C-section. He also said the blood pressure of the mother was under control.?
Priyanga, the husband of Jeewani, spoke about the death.?
?She was admitted on October 24 to the Chilaw Hospital. She was there for three days and was taken to the theatre on October 27, about 2.30 p.m. My wife signed for a Caesarean operation, but the doctors had opted for normal delivery. This led to her death. I think she would have been alive if they did a Caesarean operation because she had high blood pressure,? he lamented.?
According to him, the doctors had said that they were doing only a limited number of Cesarean operations.?
?Mothers who opt for normal delivery are often left alone and people say that some of the labour room nurses are not friendly. I heard that more babies had died in the hospital after the death of my wife and the baby. The authorities should take action immediately. Maybe she was just another patient for them, but she was my wife. It is not worth to risk my wife?s life for anyone?s carelessness,? said a sobbing husband.?
?We are operating a school service van, and the children in the van are inquiring about her. They still cry and ask me to make a complaint with the police. Anyway, no one can bring her back to life. I have lost her, but I don?t want it to happen to any other mother or child? he said between sobs.?
According to media reports such tragedies have taken place even earlier at the Chilaw Hospital.?
M. Sajeewa Shriyanthi Silva (34) in Rambepitiya, had died after delivering twins in a C- section surgery at the Chilaw Hospital. She had died during a complex operation in October 2014, according to news appearing in a website under the headline, ?Woman dies after Caesarean Operation in Chilaw?. The husband of the deceased had said that the hospital had not been able to provide the assistance of a VOG, which he cited as the reason for the death of his wife.?
On September 09, 2016 a news item accompanied by a video reported the death of 51-year-old Jude Francis in Julianwatta, Chilaw. The report said that Francis was allegedly pushed out of the hospital by the security officers because they thought he was drunk. He had then fallen and hit his head when he was pushed out. The autotsy was done at the Negombo District General Hospital and the cause of death was found to be internal bleeding, in the head.?
A series of deaths during delivery gives a clear indication that something is seriously wrong and immediate action is needed to stop whatever is causing these deaths.?

SLFP annual convention on Dec. 4
	
The annual convention of the SLFP will be held at the Sugathadasa Indoor Stadium on December 4 chaired by President Maithripala Sirisena, Minister Dayasiri Jayasekara said yesterday.
Minister Jayasekara said President Sirisena was expected to made a special announcement at the convention to be started at 2.00 pm on that day.
Minister Jayasekara told reporters at the party head office yesterday that though the UNP was in a move to put the blame on the government for the current economic and social woes, the failure in the economic front and the rising cost of living was the result of a chain reaction of global and domestic factors.
?The main contributory factor for the low domestic production was the drought that devastated mainly paddy cultivation and other essential food crops for six seasons continuously. In the meantime, there was a sharp increase of fuel prices in the global market and the increase of the interest rates by the US contributed to the steady depreciation of the rupee against the dollar in addition to low Direct Foreign Investment. There was also the drop of foreign remittances from our expatriate Sri Lankans,? Minister Jayasekara said.
He said that the incumbent Mahinda Rajapaksa government was only one month old, but had already given a package of relief to the people under these trying conditions. The domestic fuel prices have been reduced twice and there was also heavy tax cuts on agriculture, personal savings and price reduction of essential commodities.
?Under all these set backs, the government would never fail to its commitments for debt servicing and by next January we will have to allocate US$ 1,775 million for debt servicing and we will not fail in it despite the fact that State revenue has dropped by Rs. 1,200 billion,? Minister Jayasekara stressed
General Secretary of SLFP, Prof. Rohana Laksman Piyadasa said the SLFP would field its own candidate for the forthcoming Presidential poll and also contest the all elections as a grand alliance bringing all progressive and anti-imperialist and anti-UNP forces under the SLFP umbrella.

Swiss aim for EU treaty deal only in 2019 as talks stall
	
?
REUTERS, 27th NOVEMBER, 2018-The Swiss government aims to clinch a deal with the European Union on a new treaty governing relations in 2019, it said on Tuesday, again pushing back the timetable for an accord that both sides had intended to conclude this year.
Prospects for a treaty setting out Switzerland?s ties to its biggest trading partner faded last month when four years of talks yielded no breakthrough.
The EU wants neutral Switzerland to ease rules that protect high Swiss wages against cross-border competition from skilled labor. Swiss unions are fighting this tooth and nail.
The talks have been complicated by Britain?s separate negotiations on EU divorce terms, with the European Commission loath to be soft on the Swiss for fear of providing ammunition to Brexiteers.
The Swiss cabinet is due to address the situation on Friday, with leaders of all four coalition parties expressing scepticism that a deal can emerge this year ahead of elections in both Switzerland and for the European Parliament in 2019.

The Diyawanna politicos of a certain North-based political party have stopped using their mobile phones for any politically important communication purpose. They have taken this unusual step after coming to know that whatever conversation they conduct over the phone is reported to two leading Colombo-based diplomatic missions.
?
Whenever they find the necessity to make a telephone call nowadays, they would make it with a phone borrowed from someone. Or they would meet the person wanted in person.
These politicos also have been shocked to hear about certain undiplomatic activity being carried on by these two diplomatic missions.
The two missions meddling in their intraparty politics has already caused a big hullabaloo in the Northern Alliance, they say.??

Vote on Account approved by the Cabinet for Rs 1,735 billion was illegal as there was no Cabinet functioning in the country at the moment, UNP MP and Former Minister of Finance Ravi Karunanayake said today.
Mr Karunanayake told a media briefing that the move by the Cabinet to approve a Vote on Account was illegal as there was no Cabinet and a Government in Sri Lanka at the moment.
?There is no Government in Sri Lanka currently as those who called themselves the ruling party do not have a majority in Parliament,? he said.
?We challenge those who call themselves a Government to show that they have at least 90 members in the House,? he added.
Meanwhile, UNP Spokesman Harin Fernando said the Yukithiya Wenuwen (Rise for Justice) protest march has been amended due to weather conditions and the requests made by others who wanted to join.
Therefore he said the march will start from Mahiyangana instead of Kandy. A theme song for the protest has also been composed according to him.
He said his recent statement where he said it was time for the old politicians to give up and make way for the young to take over was directed to former President Mahinda Rajapaksa and not anyone from the UNP.?(Yohan Perera)

Will he resist the lure of dirty lucre?
	
?
When the political horse-trading that followed the regime change was on a very high gear, a Diyawanna politico from an East-based minor political party got a deputy office after a successful bargain.?
?
It did not take long for the party leader to hear that one of his men had played Judas and he decided to bring the renegade back to the fold with the least delay to ward off the damage to the party?s image.
The pole-vaulter soon learnt that the party leader was on his trail and went into hiding.
The party leader finding no trace of the missing party renegade met the Pohottuwa demagogue himself and appealed to him to keep under the wrap the fact that their member had been sworn in as a deputy of the new regime.
?Please don?t breathe a word about this to media at least until we, as a party, take a collective decision about our stance?? he pleaded. The demagogue readily agreed to keep the affair a secret and later apprised the party boss of the undertaking given by him.? They both kept?
their word.
Meanwhile, the pole-vaulter emerged from his hideout but kept away from the new regime. But he did not send in resignation either.
Now, the party is keeping the man under close surveillance,?they say.

Wolves at the door, and they are not here to go!
	
?You know, I am cursed with morals. I was raised a certain way. I wish I wasn?t. I wish I was raised by wolves?
-Carson Daly
It is amazing that some continue asking as to why a President who could appoint a Prime Minister with the support of around 40 MPs in Parliament in January 2015 could not do so now. More so when the President, the head of the Executive, himself asks as to why he can?t do it in October 2018, if it was possible in January 2015. The question itself coming from none other than the first citizen of the country is testimony to the degree of awareness and concern the citizenry, in general, have on Constitutional provisions and a mode of governance based on such Constitutionalism.
They remain oblivious to the fact that the powers a President enjoys are not his by hereditary succession as in the case of Monarchs, but something arising from the supreme law of the country, namely, the Constitution. In a context where many fail to notice the distinction between the powers vested in the President, Pre and Post 19th Amendment, any discussion on constitutionalism is waste of time. It becomes farcical when the President thinks that appointing a PM should be done with his aegis but not the prerogative of the Parliament. Woe unto a country befallen with such tragedy!
Quagmire runs deep...
As the chain of events triggered on the night of October 26 enters its first month, creating what some call a constitutional or political crisis, the quagmire the country has fallen into seems to run deeper than it seemed at first. In fact as days go by it gets worse with neither side prepared to budge an inch while the economy, as well as the reputation of the country in the international scene, suffer debilitating blows.
It is not very uncommon for oppositions in Parliament it walk out in protest; but when a purported government does so for whatever reasons, it is unprecedented. The Parliament is entrusted, mainly with two functions; making law and controlling finances. It is interesting to note that since the day the present government (notwithstanding the fact that technically there is no government as the Speaker , as recorded in the Hansard has declared so) has not introduced at least one Bill , let alone a budget as would have been the case in November every year, thus abrogating the duty of making law as well as controlling finances for the coming year. The reasons are within the knowledge of a five-year-old. The 121-0 result on the electronic board during the vote for the Parliamentary Select Committee appointments would be a clear precursor of their fate in case a budget or any other bill were to be submitted.
Coup on the defensive
With the Supreme Court interim order staying the dissolution of Parliament by the President, the momentum of what is known on twitter as CoupSL was arrested. The offensive suddenly turned into a series of blushing apologetics with the President, the PM and their cohorts as to what happened on October 26. Following scathing revelations recorded on phone going viral on social media, on efforts to fish MPs to support the appointed new PM and the realization dawning on such perpetrators of dastardly crimes against the sovereignty of the People devolved to their MPs elected on their ballot, with the bait of millions of rupees and other perks, that it could boomerang, the boisterous claims of winning the majority struck a dead end. Then came another tune, that of going for elections to settle this dispute once and for all. The proponents of the new government were bold in asking the question as to how an order to hold elections could be deemed undemocratic by a court. Statements made by supporters of the coup leave little doubt that there will be a lot of pressure on the Supreme Court when it delivers final relief on December 7.
Given the dark periods in our recent history, it is debatable indeed whether we have succeeded in translating the democratic system of governance in to tangible results in uplifting the lives of majority of our citizens
Moral weight
The insistence on elections betray a few realities; firstly an undeniable admission that the present PM lacks a parliamentary majority and thus cannot be constitutionally deemed the PM as that post is no longer subject to the whims and fancies of the President. Secondly, a brazen effort to derail from the representative mode of democratic governance maintained for the last 90 years since receiving universal franchise through the Donoughmore Constitution in 1931; thirdly, a desperateness to somehow grab state power at this very juncture without further delay. Whatever the reasons it represents a brazen attack on constitutionalism, representative democracy, parliamentary norms and above all decent and civilized mode of government change i.e. periodically held elections.
The decision of the SC will no doubt, carry monumental weight in terms of moral and political significance. Just as the mere interim order fashion a background for few MPs to break ranks with the incumbent government, undoubtedly any final decision in favour of the petitioners would sound the death knell for the government that was hastily and stealthily foisted on the country on the moonlit night of October 26. But yet again, I reiterate, not all human beings feel the pressure of moral weight and going by what we have seen thus far, one should not be surprised if the de facto government obstinately continues.
Given the dark periods in our recent history, it is debatable indeed whether we have succeeded in translating the democratic system of governance in to tangible results in uplifting the lives of majority of our citizens. Yet one thing undeniable was that we had never deviated from electing our leaders through the ballot, however much alloyed with corruption, deception, manipulation and downright rigging the process may be. The CoupSL pushed the entire nation to the very brink of civilized, ethical and dignified existence. The decision of the apex court on December 7 is not a mere matter of whether the President?s powers over the parliament has been curtailed by the 19th amendment or whether anyone appointed by him as PM is obliged to show the support of the parliament or anything of that sort.
Back with a bang!
It reaches far deeper and profound realities than that. It will decide whether we smash on the floor all the salutary features of representative, democratic and dignified mode of governance in one shy; whether we hark back to the era of the tribal warlord who governed by the strength of his raw and?naked power.?
CoupSL enters its second month; the wolves are ever so close, sniffing at the door that divides the civilized from the uncivilized.
?Oh yeah baby,??.. they say, ?We are back with a bang, and we are not here to go!? Wolves prevail, always!
