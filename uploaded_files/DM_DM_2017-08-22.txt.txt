Three Month-Remembrance - Asoka Warnasuriya
A classic iconoclast with Catholic taste

It was a devastating news that broke when Asoka Warnasuriyas youngest daughter Mihiri said her father had passed away the night before and her mother Dilmani wanted us informed.
Asoka was also a Royalist although our paths only crossed at the University of Ceylon, Colombo Campus and thereafter at the Katubedda campus in 1972. Asoka was a mathematician there whilst I was an undergraduate at the Department of Architecture.
After the festivities of the wedding and homecoming, Asoka and Dilmani set up house at Pamankada which was like a second home to friends like us. Asokas interests were wide and varied. His choice of music was eclectic and ranged from folk rock to ballads to opera. He was also an avid reader surpassed probably only by his wife and companion for life, Dilmani. Arguably he was the one of a kind who could and did hold his own against anyone.
Asoka and Dilmani were extremely warm people who were absolutely loyal to their friends and I was privileged to be a prime beneficiary of their goodwill in myriad ways. So now it is up to Dilmani to take up cudgels and hold the torch for both herself and the incomparable Asoka. They have been blessed with their son Asanga, doing extremely well in the commercial sector and their two daughters, in academia, Renu, a Fulbright scholar and Mihiri is a recipient of a Cambridge scholarship reading for her PhD.
Asoka was an exceptional human being and a humanist at all times. In other words there was never a dull moment with Asoka around, singing his signature song Bob Dylans Blowing in the Wind. Of course Asoka was his own man always. 
He was also a computer whiz kid whilst I was almost a Luddite. Even at home he would be found staring and working at the computer. He was a master at downloading interesting snippets of information both political and otherwise, and he would send these to his friends and family; so much so that when his friends didnt receive any such mails for a few days, they would ring and ask Dilmani whether he was ill. We all had a jolly good time with Asoka in his element. Dilmani was the designated driver. Such good times and halcyon days indeed. 

"Asoka was never, for whatever reason a globe trotter. He was out and out a Sri Lankan being comfortable in hisown skin"

Asoka was a person who would literally give his shirt off his back for a friend. I particularly remember one instance when Nimal came in a rush to my home and requested me to accompany him on a delicate mission in Embilipitya. This was in the mid 70s and Embilipitya was just a name I read in the papers and akin to the American wild west. I said OK and asked him when He said as soon as possible. We then went to Asoka s residence in Pamankada and made a request to borrow his Renault Dauphin. Dilmani looked askance but Asoka readily parted with the vehicle although that was his sole mode of conveyance to go to work. Nimal drove the car with myself as shotgun and reached Embilipitiya around midnight and immediately proceeded to engage in a negotiation with the intended father in law. Happily everything ended up OK and I along with Nimal heaved sighs of relief. The rest is history. It also showed Asoka was never judgemental and didnt have a mean streak in him. 
Of all my friends Asoka and Dilmani were two of my mothers favourites and she used to look forward to their visits. My mother passed away in 2008 and now Asoka is no more. I suppose that is destiny or kismet. There were different phases in Asokas life  a chequered career indeed. Finally he became his own boss and set up a Computer software consultancy. Here too his innate humanism showed in his dealings. Asoka spent his retirement in reading about Sri Lankas heritage and amassed quite a collection of books on Ceylon and Sri Lanka. Asoka was never for whatever reason a globe trotter. He was out and out a Sri Lankan being comfortable in his own skin.
On one occasion when I was giving Narada a lift to his home he said Asoka was the most brilliant of his siblings and could have reached dizzy heights in academia, business or even politics if he applied himself . And this was straight off the bat from Narada  an eminent Emeritus Professor of Paediatrics and ultimately Vice Chancellor of the University of Sri Jayawardenepura. 
I would be failing in my duties if I did not mention a few of Asokas salient qualities. Not only was he a true blue samasamjist like his uncle LC and his father, he was a man of the world. There was no racism in his mind or thoughts, his religion was pacifism and he did not subscribe to narrow sectarian politics. His friends included all the races, covering all religions and he did not care for caste or creed . Quintessentially Asoka was a man for all seasons. His vanity extended only to his well tended moustache. So I in turn and for my part having done my bit in extolling the virtues of dear departed Asoka shall conclude by quoting from Robert Frosts poem 
Stopping by woods on a snowy evening 
The woods are lovely dark and deep 
But I have promises to keep 
And miles to go before I sleep 
This is my humble opinion and plea for Dilmani, Asanga, Charini, Nanda, Renu and Mihiri on behalf of dear Asoka to follow without fear and with fervour.

Agreement to purchase four airbuses -- MR regime that first decided to cancel it
	
It was the Mahinda Rajapaksa government which decided to abrogate the agreement it signed with Airbus Industries to purchase four airbuses just before the regime change Minister Susil Premajayantha said.
He said the situation worsened after the yahapalana government appointed a new board of directors and told Daily Mirror that the Rajapaksa administration had decided to do so after the exposures made in the COPE report.
The COPE under the chairmanship of former minister DEW Gunasekara in its report sounded alarm bells in Parliament on the losses incurred by SriLankan airlines. COPE prepared a Businesses Plan which called for the removal of the A340 aircraft from proposed purchase agreement and lease four A350 airbuses by 2020. But the regime change in January 2015 put a stop to business plan, the minister said.
He said the new management appointed by the yahapalana government closed down three important destinations -- Paris, Frankfurt and Rome from where thousands of European tourists visit Sri Lanka while the officials in the top management increased their salaries and allowances further precipitating the financial situation of the ailing national carrier.
To make the situation worse, there was unplanned and unnecessary recruitment resulting in SriLankan being overstaffed, the minister said.
In early 2015, the government decided to cancel the lease agreement for four A350 airbuses resulting in a termination surcharge of US$146.5 million in addition to the forfeiture of US$7.5 million deposit there by incurring a massive loss of US$154 million or over Rs.231 billion.
However, the Finance Ministry intervened at this stage and renegotiated the purchase agreement with Airbus Industries with the SriLankan now having to pay US$95 million in installments after they agreed to waive US$54 million from the total commitment.
All in all, I dont understand as to why the top management of the SriLankan airlines fails to take the most pragmatic decision at the right time and run this national asset at least on a break-even point because the loses incurred by it is a heavy burden to the economy, the minister.

Ambitious newcomer shown the door
	

A well-known actor-turned politico at provincial level made news when he defected to another political party recently.

After singing the praises of his new party leader for a short while, he had approached the latter to seek the post of an electorate level party organizer. He had mentioned two electorates he was interested in and appealed that he be appointed as the organizer to one of them.
Angered by the ambitious politicos unreasonable request, the party leader had shown him the door.
The provincial politico had sought to be the organizer of one of the two electorates he mentioned knowing well that two party veterans were already functioning as the organizers of these electorates, they say.

Buhari warns off separatists, takes back control after treatment
	

REUTERS, 21th AUGUST, 2017- Nigerias President Muhammadu Buhari said on Monday he would stop separatist activists spreading unrest, seeking to reassert his hold on power after returning from his second stint of medical leave this year.
Buhari, looking thin but sounding stronger than his last broadcast in June, said he had been troubled by social media posts calling for splits in a country made up of a mostly Muslim north and a Christian south.
Since Buhari travelled to London for treatment of an unspecified condition on May 7, campaign groups have stepped up calls for a separate southeastern state known as Biafra, evoking memories of a conflict there that killed hundreds of thousands in the 1960s.
Militants and community groups have also called for the independence of the restive southern Niger Delta oil hub, saying it should receive a greater share of Nigerias energy wealth.
Islamist Boko Haram militants are fighting for a separate caliphate in the northeast. Buhari, a northern Muslim, has spent more time out of Nigeria so far in 2017 than he has inside the country, prompting fears that he is not well enough to run Africas largest economy, which is mired in its first recession in 25 years.
The former military rulers refusal to disclose details of his illness have prompted calls for greater transparency.

CEYLON BAITHULMAL FUND SALUTES ITS SUPPORTERS
	
SERVING THE POOR AND NEEDY FOR 60 YEARS
The 60th AGM of the Ceylon BaithulmalFund was held on August 20. The Fund was established in 1957 and was incorporated by an Act of Parliament, Law No 9 of 1976 and completes 60 years this year with an exceptional record of dedicated service to the poor and the needy. 
CBF was formed on the initiative of the late H. S. Ismail (the first Muslim Speaker of the House of Representatives) who served as its President from 1957 to 1973. 
Al-Haj A. A. M. Illyas Admani, an eminent lawyer and industrialist, was re-elected as the President for the year 2017/2018. Other Management Committee members include luminaries from the Legal, Accountancy, Banking, IT, Insurance Sectors and Directors of Companies. 
The Ceylon Baithulmal Fund in its long journey of 60 years has been of service to the poor, the destitute and the needy. It has assisted the elderly, displaced, orphans, widows and invalids. It has also provided scholarships to students and undergraduates from needy families to pursue their studies. 

"During the times of natural disasters which sometimes shatter the lives of many families, the Fund respond with emergency relief"

In addition, the CBF provides marriage assistance and Iddah allowances, assistance to repair houses, to pay off debts, to start a vocation or self-employment. During the times of natural disasters which sometimes shatter the lives of many families, the Fund responds with emergency relief and more importantly by addressing the long term needs of the unfortunate victims by providing the needed resources which will assist them to generate a regular income and support their families and rebuild their lives. 
More recent key activities of the CBF are the Village and Urban Development Programmes where its officials reach out to the poorest of the poor throughout the country and townships and with the local Masjid officials evaluate the assistance requirements which vary from self- employment, education, orphan and widows support and medical assistance. We have assisted several such remote villages and urban areas under this programme and the next village development programme is scheduled for September in villages off Nawalapitiya.
The Fund has always received overwhelming response from the community towards its efforts of eradicating poverty through its various programmes and in this diamond jubilee anniversary, the CBF wishes to place on record its deepest appreciation to all our respected donors who trust us and continue supporting our work. It is with their support that we continue to improve income, livelihood, living conditions and empower hundreds of needy and poor families across the country.

Cricket administrators should be accused of defeat: Arjuna
	
Petroleum Resources Development Minister Arjuna Ranatunge said today it was not the players who should be accused of recent cricket defeat but it was the administrators who should be accused of the defeat.
He told parliament that it was the innocent people who were held responsible for the failure in cricket and added that no one talked about the failure in the administration.
"The cricket fans are perturbed today. It is the good people who become responsible. The coaches and captains were chased away during recent defeats. No one talks about the failure in the administration," he said.
He said the authorities were trying to hide the failure in the administration by passing the buck to cricket manager Asanga Gurusinghe this time.
He said the Sports Ministry should formulate a mechanism to protect the players and added that mentality of the players had been deteriorated by the administration.
He said the failure in Sri Lanka cricket was due to non-implementation of sports rules and regulations where some people involved in betting and newspaper industry were engaged in cricket administration.
JVP MP Nalinda Jayatissa also said that Sri Lanka cricket should be free of political interference for the development of the game. (Ajith Siriwardana and Yohan Perera)

Election delays: Watchdogs to seek legal action
	
Election monitoring organisations today warned the Government that they would seek stern legal action if the Government failed to pass the proposed amendments to the Elections Act, which would delay Local Government elections further.
Addressing a press briefing the 'March-12 Movement', a voluntary organisation consisting of representatives from election monitoring organisations, civil society groups and trade unions charged that following the mutual consensus of all political parties the LG elections were delayed for four years.
While expressing their displeasure to the Government for violating the peoples voting right, Manjula Gajanayaka of the Centre for Monitoring Election Violence (CMEV) said commencing the elections in a timely manner was the cornerstone of Good Governance that people expected after 2015.
The electoral term of the Batticaloa Municipal Council was the first to end, which was around four years ago. Subsequently, the electoral terms of numerous other Local Government institutions too concluded.
If nothing happens in the coming two weeks the Elections Commissioner will receive the full authority to hold the election in North Central, Sabaragamuwa and Eastern Provinces, he said.
Meanwhile, PAFFREL Director Rohana Hettiarachchi said election monitoring organisations feared the delay of LG polls, citing the debate for the amendments of the new Elections Act.
The Act is to be debated in House on 24 and voted on September 6. If this was not passed the election would be further delayed. Moreover, the Government is also attempting to reduce the 25 percent female representation quota. We are totally against such a move, he said.
Further, the movement said the two delimitation reports, which were prepared in order to implement this mixed system of elections, while the first report was flawed and the second report was delayed, became the decisive factors that affected the delay in holding the elections.
Although such was the reasoning for the said delay, the point that warrants further contemplation is attributed to the fact that on which day, would be the Local Government elections, which should empower the closest institutions to the general public, be held, it said.
Further, it said that a continual postponement would not be palatable for the general public, regardless of what is set out in the Constitution.
Amidst the delay, the immediate task at hand is the passing of the proposed draft amendments to the Act that has already been presented to Parliament, it said. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

Five injured, 10 missing  as US Navy destroyer collides with a merchant ship
	

Ten U.S. Navy sailors are missing and five were injured after the USS John S. McCain guided missile destroyer and an oil tanker three times its size collided near Singapore early Monday. 
This is the second time in two months that a Navy destroyer based at the 7th Fleets home port of Yokosuka, Japan, has been involved in a collision at sea. Seven sailors were killed when the USS Fitzgerald collided with a container ship south of Japan in June. 
American and Singaporean ships and helicopters are involved in a search-and-rescue mission after the pre-dawn collision at the entrance to one of the worlds busiest shipping lanes. 
The McCain, an Arleigh Burke-class destroyer equipped with Aegis missiles, had been on its way to a routine port visit in Singapore after patrolling in the South China Sea. Shipping data showed that the Liberian-flagged merchant vessel Alnic MC was also on its way to Singapore when the vessels collided east of the Strait of Malacca at 5:24 a.m. local time, while it was still dark. Initial reports indicated that the destroyer sustained damage to its port side at the rear, but is currently sailing under its own power and heading to port in Singapore.

France police officer nabbed with a Buffalo skull and a pair of hornes
	
A French Police officer had been intercepted last evening at the Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA) while attempting to smuggle out a buffalo skull and a pair of horns, Airport Deputy Customs Director Parakrama Basnayake said.
He said the suspect (56) was arrested, while he was trying to board to Dubai by UL 225 with his son.
Following a tip off and a suspicious scanner image the Customs officer managed to find out the skull and horns packed in his luggage. This was a rare case which we have detected so far, Mr. Basnayake said.
Taking dead animals or their parts out of the country is strictly protected and prohibited under the Fauna and Flora Protection (Amendment) Act, No. 22 of 2009. If a person wants to transport or keep animal parts in his/her procession, a proper permit should be obtained from the Wild Life Conservation Department.
Accordingly, the arrested person had no valid document with him from the Wild Life Conservation Department pertaining to the detected.
During the investigations at the Customs, the suspect had said that he was taking buffalo skull and a pair of horns because of his son loved to keep them with him.
Later Customs officers warned him not to take them out of the country and later he agreed to not to take them and after the Customs inquiry the suspect and his son were released.
However the buffalo skull and a pair of horns were confiscated.
The detection was conducted by the Customs Assistant Superintendent Isuru Nagahawatte and the investigation was carried out by the Airport Deputy Customs Director Parakrama Basnayake. (Chaturanga Pradeep)

Amendments to the Local Government Act not consistent with its nature, would be excluded during the Committee Stage of the debate, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe told Parliament today.
The Premier came up with this statement in response to a question raised by the Opposition on the Bill last afternoon.
Chief Opposition Whip Anura Kumara Dissanayake, who raised a question on the matter inquired into what the Government intended doing with a large number of amendments, which he said were not consistent with the very nature of the Local Government election Bill.
"You are saying you will bring new amendments to the Bill, but there are a large number of amendments, which are inconsistent with the very nature of the Bill," he said.
Joint Opposition MP Vasudeva Nanayakkara also raised a similar issue but highlighted that the new amendments should be in the hands of the MPs so that they would have sufficient time to study them.
Don't get into the wrong impression that the Opposition is trying to delay the Local Government election, he said.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe in response said all inconsistent amendments would be excluded, while anyone could present new amendments during the Committee Stage.

India's supreme court bans Islamic instant divorce
	
Indias top court has banned a controversial Islamic practice that allows men to divorce their wives instantly, saying it was unconstitutional.
Victims of the practice known as triple talaq, whereby Muslim men can divorce their wives by reciting the word talaq (divorce) three times, had approached the supreme court to ask for a ban.
Triple talaq is not integral to religious practice and violates constitutional morality, a panel of judges said.
Its a very happy day for us. Its a historic day, said Zakia Soman, the co-founder of the Indian Muslim Womens Movement, which was part of the legal battle to end the practice.
We, the Muslim women, are entitled to justice from the courts as well as the legislature, she added.
The five supreme court judges were from Indias major faiths  Hinduism, Christianity, Islam, Sikhism and Zoroastrianism. In their ruling, they said it was manifestly arbitrary to allow a man to break down [a] marriage whimsically and capriciously.
What is sinful under religion cannot be valid under law, they said.
The practice had been challenged in lower courts but it was the first time Indias supreme court had considered whether triple talaq was legal.
India allows religious institutions to govern matters of marriage, divorce and property inheritance in the multi-faith nation, enshrining triple talaq as a legal avenue for its 180 million Muslims to end unions.
More than 20 Muslim countries, including neighbouring Pakistan and Bangladesh, have banned the practice while in India, the practice has continued. While most Hindu personal law has been overhauled and codified over the years, Muslim laws have been left to religious authorities and left largely untouched.
The Hindu nationalist government of the prime minister, Narendra Modi, had backed the petitioners in this landmark case, declaring triple talaq unconstitutional and discriminatory against women. Modis Bharatiya Janata party has long pushed for a uniform civil code, governing Indians of all religions, to be enforced.
The issue remains highly sensitive in India, where religious tensions often lead to violence.
The All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB), a grouping of Islamic organisations, had told the court that while they considered the practice of triple talaq wrong, they opposed any court intervention and asked that the matter be left to the community to tackle.
Progressive Muslim activists had criticised the boards position. This is the demand of ordinary Muslim women for over 70 years and its time for this country to hear their voices, activist Feroze Mithiborwala told New Delhi television station.
Some Islamic scholars say there is no mention of triple talaq in the Quran, which instead details a different process for divorce based on mediation.(The Guardian)

Novel ruse to make the not me claim
	

A certain ministry bigwig known to be a political appointee is deliberately changing his signature when signing official documents, they say.

This unusual practice of varying the signature resorted to by the boss have become both a puzzle and a big question mark to the subordinate white-collar ones, but they do not openly talk about it let alone inquire about it for fear of possible dire consequences.
Very often this white collar bigwig would put aside important files put up for his signature saying that he would look into them later.
There are about 30 key departments coming under the purview of this Ministry and action in respect of certain projects and programmes is getting held up as the files put up for instructions or approval change hands among Ministry high-ups without being duly attended to.
Meanwhile, some Ministry employees suspect that their boss has made it a practice to avoid signing certain documents and also write his signature differently, as a precaution against possible inquiries against him under a different administration in future.

The Higher Education and Highways Ministry today sought Parliamentary approval for Rs.53,000 million to fund six projects including the extension of the Southern Expressway, construction of the third phase of the Colombo Outer Circular Road and the construction of a new bridge across the Kelani River.
Higher Education and Highways Minister Lakshman Kiriella informed Parliament that Rs. 51.5 billion out of the Rs. 53 billion would be raised under the loan scheme of China, Japan and Asian Development Bank, while only Rs. 2.5 billion would be sought from local funds.
He said the extension of the Southern Expressway from Godagama to Hambantota by 96 km was under construction and that 35 percent of the construction had been completed.
He said Rs. 29, 060 million was allocated from the 2017 budget but the allocated funds had already been spent and added that Rs. 24,000 million foreign loans and Rs. 1,200 local funds were needed for the year 2017.
He said the expressway would be opened by 2019.
Minister Kiriella said Rs. 6,000 million more was needed for the construction of the Colombo Outer Circular Road from Kadawatha to Kerawalapitiya for the rest of 2017 as the allocated funds of Rs. 5,000 million had already been spent.
He said additional funds of Rs. 6,000 million were needed for the year 2017 for the construction of a new bridge across the Kelani River as well.
He said the project was funded by a loan provided by Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA).
He said the construction work of the bridge would commence in October this year and expected to complete the project by 2020.
He said Rs. 3750 million for the first phase of the third priority road project, Rs. 8,000 million for the i-Road project and Rs. 4,050 million for the second phase of the third priority road project were needed for the rest of 2017. (Ajith Siriwardana and Yohan Perera)

A purohita who has taken over a new ministry has given the nod for constructing a new reception counter at an estimated cost of Rs.6 million to replace the existing counter despite it being still in good condition.

The proposal to construct a new counter has been mooted by a political authority handling employment on a request by an establishment head, they say.
A grant extended by the Asian Development Bank is to be utilized for this uncalled for project.

South Africa grants Zimbabwes first lady immunity
	

(c) 2017, The Washington Post  Max Bearak Aug 21, 2017 - Grace Mugabe, wife of Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe, is back in her country after South Africa granted her diplomatic immunity Sunday amid allegations that she viciously assaulted a 20-year-old model who was spending time in a hotel with two of her sons in the city of Johannesburg. 
South Africas main opposition party demanded a parliamentary inquiry into the decision and said on Twitter that the government no longer has legitimacy in the arena of international diplomacy and displays a total disregard for the rule of law. A lawyer representing Gabriella Engels, the victim of the alleged assault, said he would seek to bar the Zimbabwean first lady from ever returning to South Africa. 
On numerous occasions, the first lady has been accused of assaulting photographers and then invoked diplomatic immunity. Robert Jr. and Chatunga have been booted from at least two apartments for rowdiness.

Surrender or die: Iraqi PM issues stark warning to ISIS jihadis
	

Iraq, (Daily Mail), 21 August
2017 - Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi has announced that the town of Tal Afar will be taken from the Islamic State in a speech where he warned the terror group to surrender or die. 
Tal Afar and the surrounding area is one of the last pockets of IS-held territory in Iraq after victory was declared in July in Mosul, the countrys second-largest city. 
The town, about 150 kilometres (93 miles) east of the Syrian border, sits along a major road that was once a key IS supply route. 
The city of Tal Afar will be liberated and will join all the liberated cities, Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi said in an address to the nation broadcast on state television early on Sunday. 
Iraqs mostly Shiite militiamen largely stayed out of the operation to retake Mosul, a mostly Sunni city about 80 kilometres (50 miles) to the east, but have vowed to play a bigger role in the battle for Tal Afar, which was home to both Sunni and Shiite Turkmen before it fell to IS, a Sunni extremist group.

Swarna Mallawarachchi: The woman I saw
	
A tribute to the first real woman I saw on screen here
In Yasapalitha Nanayakkaras Anjana, Swarna Mallawarachchi does something she never did in her other movies. Dance. Anjana erupts in a riot of colour (it still feels rather over saturated today, like all those commercial films from the eighties and practically subsists on sharply defined reds, greens, and blues: ideal for the lavish, visually lovely, but rather incongruous dance sequences it contained. 
When we see Swarna in that glamorous red gown today, we are not taken aback, we are stumped. But then we belong to a different generation. In her time audiences would have followed her ascent, from Yasapalitha Nanayakkara to Dharmasiri Bandaranayake and Vasantha Obeyesekere, gradually.

In our time audiences would have flocked to see her in Dadayama and Kadapathaka Chaya. We had seen her in these and assumed that they were all she was in. We never bothered to look at her past, at all those supporting roles she had to tolerate before her big break.
Just as we secretly loathe our commercial comedies and melodramas and their cast members, we also secretly play along to the myths they make use of. The lone woman in the company of men is there to be caught and almost killed before the other men rescue her. The rich heiress elopes with her poor paramour to a life of ease and comfort. The idealist abandoned by her lover croons about her plight to the only people who will listen to her, the audience.
These situations involve women, and not for no reason: our cinema has tapped into our patriarchal outlook of the world in ways no other art form has, ever. The myths they revolve around needed directors who could challenge if not upend them and, obviously, actors who could break them apart. Not until Swarna did we come across such a woman, such a performer.
Along with Anjana, there were four movies which signalled Swarna Mallawarachchis return to the cinema after her sojourn in England: Sankapali, Ridi Nimnaya, Biththi Hathara, and Yahalu Yeheli. She won an award jointly for the latter three from the OCIC in 1982, one year after she was snubbed off with a token Merit Prize at the Presidential Awards Ceremony for Hansa Vilak.
The difference between her role in Hansa Vilak and those three performances couldnt have been more apparent. The latter three reflected her debut roles in Sath Samudura, Hanthane Kathawa, and Thunman Handiya, because of how unlikeable she was in them: in Yahalu Yeheli, for instance, she sides with her father against her own sister (the protagonist), while in Sath Samudura and Thunman Handiya she was as unsympathetic a relative. 
"With other directors she was virtually in a different universe, but with Dharmasiri Bandaranayake and Vasantha Obeyesekere she almost always got to play that kind of woman: torn apart, wasted away, and always seeking a way of fighting back. In the end this meant that she would embody the qualities of the same people she was fighting against, which is what she underwent in Kadapathaka Chaya"
In Hansa Vilak Swarna, as Miranda Ranaweera, becomes an inexorable figure of vagueness and confusion. Theres really no character whom we empathise with in the first place: not Miranda, not her lover Nissanka, not her husband Douglas, and not Nissankas brother-in-law Dayananda. The only real figure of empathy is Nissankas wife, Samantha, but then she was played by Vasanthi Chathurani, a qualitatively different actress. (She was the girl next door, which Swarna never was.) 
When Miranda confesses about her adultery to Nissanka (she wants to return to Douglas), and when Nissanka reacts by attacking her, she doesnt weep or scream or even moan, she just laughs. Ive known all along that this was my fate. Why wait any more then Go ahead, kill me now! she practically sneers. Nissankas feelings of betrayal are ours too, to be sure, but Swarnas enigma intrigues us. What does she mean Perhaps its her religious devotion, or the sense of guilt it compels in her. 
Even Swarna was afraid of taking that role, she once informed me. I read the script Dharmasiri had written, and given that back then our cinema divided women into either paragons of virtue or she-devils, I thought my character was dark. I called Dharmasiri and told him this, but he assuaged my doubts. 
She wasnt completely wrong there, of course, because on the basis of the criterion we used to judge female characters back then, she was a conniver, a she-devil. The great achievement of Hansa Vilak was that it was the first Sinhala film that delved into the subjective consciousness of a single character. If audiences found fault with Miranda it was because of this lopsided perspective: we dont see what Nissanka doesnt, we only imagine it. Hes convinced that Miranda is a conniving double-crosser, and given that we are seeing the world through his eyes, we concur. 
Bawa Duka
"With other directors she was virtually in a different universe, but with Dharmasiri Bandaranayake and Vasantha Obeyesekere she almost always got to play that kind of woman: torn apart, wasted away, and always seeking a way of fighting back"
Fortunately for her, the films she got thereafter never played around with that kind of confused perspective we saw her through before. In Suddilage Kathawa, Dadayama, Maya, and Sagara Jalaya, not only is she suavely confident of her own infallibility, she is adamant that she is the only real human being in the story. 
The first half of Suddilage Kathawa, for instance, until Romiels return from prison, is about Suddis sexual conquests, her only method of survival in her village. Romiel: wasnt he sent to prison for murdering somebody the mudalali, played by the lewdest womaniser to ever be depicted in our cinema, Somi Ratnayake, asks, to which Swarna casually replies, The Arachchi will set him free soon; hes looking after the lawyer wholl be defending him.
 We obviously dont believe her, and neither does the mudalali. But her casual reply isnt a mere reply, its an invitation: a few minutes later, she has got him hooked up with her, and he becomes her benefactor. 
How she does it, and by doing it how she shows us her invincible, indomitable character, was Swarnas real achievement. Dadayama is an enduring film even today not only because of Ravindra Randeniyas Priyankara Jayanath, but also because Swarna stands for everything that a woman, at that point in time, was told to never be: a fighter, a rebel, a destroyer.
She asserts her dignity in that last sequence knowing very well that she wont survive, but she gets on with it to prove to herself, and to her tormentor, that she can be as animalistic and predatory as he is. You cant imagine another actress in such a powerful sequence because no other actress could be as frighteningly bestial as she was. Shes no longer the prey or the hunted; shes the hunter, hell-bent on tilting the scales against the man she once loved. 
Dadayama
"Swarna Mallawarachchis forte  embodying our deepest affection for and fear and even mild hatred of the woman as a rebel  became its own standard, its own benchmark"
With other directors she was virtually in a different universe, but with Dharmasiri Bandaranayake and Vasantha Obeyesekere she almost always got to play that kind of woman: torn apart, wasted away, and always seeking a way of fighting back. In the end this meant that she would embody the qualities of the same people she was fighting against, which is what she underwent in Kadapathaka Chaya.
Laleen Jayamanne, in her book Towards Cinema and its Double, describes Swarnas character in Kadapathaka Chaya, Nanda, as unappealing, ambivalent, fatal: not the woman whos fated to destroy her man, but the woman who becomes an avenger through a complex array of familial, social, and power relationships. In Dadayama she dreams of a life with Priyankara. In Kadapathaka Chaya, that dream ends the moment shes raped by her brother-in-law, which sets of a chain of events that end with her manipulating him for her ends and her act of throwing acid on his face.
(As with Obeyesekeres other films, this too was based on a real incident.). In the seventies and eighties the Western cinema tended to represent women, not as heroines, but as heroes: as doers, not submissive receptacles. Swarna in effect trumped this way of representing women because she was both a doer and submissive receptacle even in her most landmark performances.
She is at the receiving end of a patriarchal world, but ironically and until her own end she aspires to be a member of that same world. Her desire in Dadayama is to marry Priyankara, just as her desire in Kadapathaka Chaya is to live a life of peace and comfort with Piyatilake. In our films marriage has been the great consoler, so even when shes beaten down and traumatised, it is to that consoler she wants to succumb, to run off. 
Suddilage Kathawa
Swarna Mallawarachchis forte  embodying our deepest affection for and fear and even mild hatred of the woman as a rebel  became its own standard, its own benchmark. Thats why its difficult to remake Suddilage Kathawa today (Dharmasiri Bandaranayake has been approached with offers to remake it, all of which he has refused): not only because theres no contemporary equivalent for Swarna, but because weve gone past that eroticised, multifarious depiction of the female victim.
And as Asoka Handagamas Let Her Cry shows, even she seems to have realised this. Swarna began her career as less than empathetic in-laws. She went on to depict victims we took to even though we knew they were doomed. With Let Her Cry, she has let go to turn into a morally confused matriarch. No two performances of hers are the same, Handagama has informed us. True. On that count, she has become the inverse of the tormented female she portrayed until another of his films (his debut), Channa Kinnari. Handagama brought her back to the cinema after 20 years. It remains to be seen what her return will portend. Until then, we can only speculate.

Tobgay wants Sri Lanka to walk through Bhutans biological corridors
	
Prime Minister of Bhutan Tshering Tobgay
In a world that is threatened by climatic change, we are a carbon neutral country,- Tshering Tobgay, Prime Minister, Bhutan.

With the current climatic issues that wrap the world up in concern, suggestions and solutions to go green and be eco-friendly are sprouting everyday. Global warming, our gravest climatic combatant, shows no sign of slowing down. Carbon dioxide is one of the main green house gases that contribute to the environmental enemy, global warming. Amidst all this climatic confusion that has been spurred on, Bhutan has stepped up as a carbon neutral country, emerging as a climatic hero setting an example to the rest of the world. 
Bhutans Prime Minister, Tshering Tobgays revolutionary TED talk caused the world to watch in awe at Bhutans exemplary eco-efforts, which inspired the world to follow in their footsteps and be more practical in going green and eco-friendly. TED talks- sloganed as ideas worth spreading -are videos of speeches given by experts who have the power to influence peoples perceptions and opinions on various fields from entertainment to technology to design. The Bhutan Prime Ministers TED talk lived up to every word of the slogan as an idea worth spreading. The talk also sets an example underscores a moral that we Sri Lankans should definitely consider looking up to. Tiny though it may be, Bhutan is a country which sets many examples and gives lessons to other countries. In that context it isnt tiny at all. 
Dressed in Bhutans national costume, Tobgay steered his way to the main topic by way of his Gho. Our national dress is unique, but that is not the only thing that is unique about our country. Our promise to remain carbon neutral is also unique. And this is what Id like to speak about today, our promise to remain carbon neutral,he said.

"We call this holistic approach to development, Gross National Happiness or GNH. Back in the 1970s, our fourth king famously pronounced that for Bhutan Gross National Happiness is more important than Gross National Product, he recalled"
He started taking a peek at the background details of Bhutan and at the same time shunning away misconceptions based on his country which brought quite a few laughs from his audience. Bhutan is a small country in the Himalayas. My country isnt one big monastery populated with happy monks. The reality is that there are barely 700,000 of us sandwiched between two of the most populated countries on earth, China and India. The reality is that we are a small underdeveloped country doing our best to survive. But we are doing ok. We are surviving. In fact we are thriving, Tobgay said.
He credited Bhutans successes to the kings who worked selflessly for the good of their people. What was truly exceptional was how Bhutan gave more priority to the Gross National Happiness(GNH) over Gross National Product (GNP) which isnt the case in most developed countries, let alone developing countries.The reason we are thriving is because weve been blessed with extraordinary kings.
Our enlightened monarchs have worked tirelessly to develop our country, balancing economic growth carefully with social development and environmental sustainability and cultural preservation, all within the framework of good governance. We call this holistic approach to development, Gross National Happiness or GNH. Back in the 1970s, our fourth king famously pronounced that for Bhutan Gross National Happiness is more important than Gross National Product, he recalled.

"So our country is under forest cover and all that forest is pristine. Thats why we are one of the few remaining global biodiversity hot spots in the world"
Despite an economy of GDP less than 2 billion dollars, Bhutans principles come through for the well-being of its people and stick unwaveringly to their policy of GNH before GNP which is something that should be considered by governing bodies in other countries as well. Ever since, all development in Bhutan is driven by GNH, a pioneering vision that aims to improve the happiness and well-being of our people. But thats easier said than done, especially when you are one of the smallest economies in the world.
Our entire GDP is less than 2 billion dollars. So our economy is small, but here is where it gets interesting. Education is completely free, all citizens are guaranteed free schooling, and those who work hard are given free college education. Health care is also completely free. Medical consultation,medical treatment and medicines, they are all provided for by the state. We manage this because we use our limited resources very carefully. This is also possible because we stay faithful to the core mission of GNH which is development with values, he stressed.
His next few words prove an important lesson, especially to us, Sri Lankans. Our economy is small and we must strengthen it. Economic growth is important, but that economic growth mustnt come from undermining our unique culture or our pristine environment. Today our culture is flourishing. We continue to celebrate our art and architecture, food and festivals, monks and monasteries. And yes we celebrate our national dress too. So our culture is flourishing. But so is our environment, said Tobgay.
"But neither Bhutan nor the world can afford to spend 15 years going backwards. This is why his majesty the king started Bhutan for Life"
According to Bhutans Premier, 72% of Bhutan is under forest cover. Our constitution demands that a minimum of 60% of Bhutans total land shall remain under forest cover for all time. The government shall ensure that in order to conserve the countrys natural resources and to prevent degradation of the ecosystem, a minimum of 60% of Bhutans total land shall be maintained under forest cover for all time, the Premier said.
In a world where political leaders fight over power, Bhutans kings set an example to other leadership figures through their actions, which is through righteous governance. Incidentally our king used this constitution to impose democracy on us. You see, we the people, didnt want democracy. We didnt ask for it, we didnt demand for it and we certainly didnt fight for it. Instead our king imposed democracy on us by insisting that he will include it in the constitution. But he went further. He included provisions in the constitution that empower the people to impeach their kings and included provisions here that require all our kings to retire at the age of 65, he said.
In the name of development and advancement, foliage is being reduced to nothing, but concrete in many countries. But Bhutan stands strong as an exception. So our country is under forest cover and all that forest is pristine. Thats why we are one of the few remaining global biodiversity hot spots in the world. And thats why we are a carbon neutral country. In a world that is threatened with climate change we are a carbon neutral country. Turns out its a big deal. Out of the 200-odd countries in the world today, it looks like we are the only one thats carbon neutral. Actually thats not quite accurate. Bhutan isnt carbon neutral, Bhutan is carbon negative,the Premier added.

Today more than a half of our country is protected as national parks, nature reserves and wildlife sanctuaries. But the beauty is that weve connected them all with one another through a network of biological corridors

According to the Bhutan Premier, his country generates 2.2 million tons of carbon dioxide, but their forests sequester more than three times that amount

Our constitution demands that a minimum of 60% of Bhutans total land shall remain under forest cover for all time

He credited Bhutans successes to the kings who worked selflessly for the good of their people

Despite an economy of GDP less than 2 billion dollars, Bhutans principles come through for the well-beingof its people

According to Bhutans Premier, 72% of Bhutan is under forest cover

Tobgay further said that his country and his people have done nothing to contribute to global warming

The clean green energy Bhutan exports would offset something like 50 million tons ofcarbon dioxide a year
According to the Bhutan Premier, his country generates 2.2 million tons of carbon dioxide, but their forests sequester more than three times that amount. So Bhutan stands as a net carbon sink for more than 4 million tons of carbon dioxide each year. But that isnt all of Bhutans efforts. They export most of the renewable electricity generated from the fast flowing rivers that stream the country. And the clean energy that is exported offsets about 6 million tons of carbon dioxide in Bhutans locality.
By 2020 well be exporting enough electricity to offset 17 million tons of carbon dioxide. And if we were to harness even half of our hydropower potential, thats exactly what we are working at. The clean green energy that we export would offset something like 50 million tons of carbon dioxide a year. That is more CO2 than what the entire city of New York generates in One year. So inside our country we are a net of carbon sink. Outside we are offsetting carbon.
This is important as well. You see the world is getting warmer and climate change is a reality. Climatic change is affecting my country. Our glaciers are melting causing flash floods and landslides which in turn are causing disaster and widespread destruction in our country. We have 2700 of them to contend with,he warned.
Tobgay further said that his country and his people have done nothing to contribute to global warming, but they are already bearing the brunt of its consequences. And its very difficult for Bhutan, being a small poor country, landlocked and mountainous. This statement familiarizes with how selfish the world can be and not pausing to think about how ones actions will affect others. But we arent going to sit on our hands doing nothing, the Bhutan Prime Minister said.
We will fight climatic change. Thats why we have promised to remain carbon neutral. We first made this promise in 2009 during COP 15 in Copenhagen, but nobody took notice. Governments were so busy arguing with and blaming one another for causing climatic change that when a small country raised our hands and announced we promise to remain carbon neutral for all time, nobody heard us. Nobody cared. Last December in Paris at COP 21 we reiterated our promise to remain carbon neutral for all time to come. This time we were heard. We were noticed and everybody cared.
What was different in Paris was that governments came round together to accept the realities of climatic change. They were willing to come together and act together and work together, all countries from the very small to the very large made a commitment to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions,Tobgay said.
Tobgay stressed on how crucial its to stick to ones commitments and shared ways in which Bhutan volunteers to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. As far as Bhutan is concerned, we will keep our promise to remain carbon neutral. Here are some of the ways we are doing it. We are providing free electricity to our rural farmers.
The idea is that with free electricity they will no longer have to use firewood to cook their food. We are investing in sustainable transport and subsidizing the purchase of electric vehicles. Similarly we are subsidizing the cost of LED lights and our entire Government is trying to go paperless. We are cleaning up our entire country through Clean Bhutan- a national program. We are planting trees throughout our country through Green Bhutan another national program. But its our protected areas that are at the core of our carbon neutral strategy. Our protected areas are our carbon sink. They are our lungs, said a proud Tobgay.
A concept that could be adopted from Bhutan and truly be put into practice in Sri Lanka is the interconnection of national parks, reserves and sanctuaries with one another. Sri Lanka, a country with many protected nature sites that shelter diversities of fauna and flora, would surely benefit from this idea. Today more than a half of our country is protected as national parks, nature reserves and wildlife sanctuaries.
But the beauty is that weve connected them all with one another through a network of biological corridors. Now what this means is that our animals are free to roam throughout our country, he said. Every year Bhutan sets aside resources to prevent poaching, hunting, mining and pollution in their national parks and also uses resources to help communities who live in those parks. 
"We are planting trees throughout our country through Green Bhutan another national program. But its our protected areas that are at the core of our carbon neutral strategy. Our protected areas are our carbon sink. They are our lungs"
But leading better lives while continuing to live in harmony with Mother Nature is expensive, but the approach that Bhutan has taken in addressing this issue is quite impressive. Over the next few years our small economy wont have the resources to cover all the costs that are required to protect our environment. In fact when we run the numbers it looks like itll take us at least 15 years before we can fully finance all our conservation efforts.
But neither Bhutan nor the world can afford to spend 15 years going backwards. This is why his majesty the king started Bhutan for Life. Bhutan for life gives us the time we need. Its essentially a funding mechanism to look after our parks. To protect our parks until our Government can take over on our own fully. The idea is to raise a transition fund from individual donors,corporations and institutions, but the deal is closed only after predetermined conditions are met and all funds committed.
So multiparty, single closing an idea we burrowed from Wall Street. This means that individual donors can commit without having to worry that theyll be left supporting an underfunded plan. Its something like a kick starter project only with a 15-year time horizon and millions of tons of carbon dioxide at stake. Once the deal is closed we use the transition fund to protect our parks giving our Government time to increase our own funding gradually until the end of the 15-year period. After that our Government guarantees full funding forever. We are almost there. We expect to close later this year,the Premier said.
In conclusion, Tobgay expressed his wish to share his dream with the rest of the world. Selfless as it is, its a dream that every one of us can afford to share which could result in that dream becoming a reality. What if we could mobilize our leadership and our resources, our influence and our passion to replicate the Bhutan for Life idea to other countries, so that they too can conserve the protected areas for all time
After all, there are many other countries that face the same issues that we face. They too have natural resources that can help win the worlds fight for sustainability. Only they may not have the ability to invest in them now. So what if we set up Earth for Life a global fund to kick start the Bhutan for life throughout the world I invite you to help me to carry this dream beyond our borders to all those who care about our planets future. After all, were here to dream together, to work together, to fight climate change together to protect our planet together. Because the reality is, we are in it together, underscored Tobgay.

Wilpattu:  Truth and lies
	
This country has had no shortage of divisive public issues over the years. But, of all the bitterly fought media wars, the controversy over the Wilpattu National Park is easily one of the most savage and divisive. Not being limited to an environmental issue, it divided people along clear-cut ethnic and religious lines, and the controversy rages on and on. 
Wilpattu  Boruwa saha Sebewa (Wilpattu  truth and lies) is a book by environmentalist Thilak Kariyasawam and Rekha Nilukshi Herath, an investigative journalist of the Ravaya newspaper. In this meticulously detailed and superbly illustrated work, they proceed to demolish the myths and establish some salient facts about the national park, the alleged illegal settlements and history of the area. 
Wilpattu became such a fight-to-the death issue mainly because of ethnic and religious insensitivity, amid wild and heated claims that Muslims are being illegally settled within the national park. That many of these settlers had already lived in these areas before being summarily expelled by the LTTE as part of their ethnic cleansing was completely ignored.
The myth that Muslims are quietly infiltrating part of the Sinhala land is still being perpetrated (while destroying invaluable environmental heritage to boot) and has an international band of followers in countries as far away as South Korea. 
Supplemented by extensive research done by Thilak Kariyawasam, Nilukshi Herath has expanded a series of newspaper articles into 181-page book. Among our national parks, Wilpattu suffered most from the civil war, suffering LTTE attacks which forced two lengthy closures and destruction of its wildlife department property as well as large tracts of jungle caused by illegal timber trading. But, once the war ended and Wilpattu was re-opened to the public in 2010, the environmental damage was seen as solely caused by illegal Muslim settlers making settlements on the sly. The media and a star cast of environmentalists, religious (mainly Buddhist) dignitaries, political, business and academic figures who formed a powerful Wilpattu lobby simply ignored the fact that some of these settlers had deeds going back to the 1920s. 


	It becomes clear that it wasnt the environment but ethnic and religious bigotry which turned Wilpattu into such a sacred cow. The settlers were Muslims. The controversial settlements were situated in the national parks periphery, not within its boundaries
	
	
	Then there is a new Sinhala settlement at Pukkulam, which is within the Wilpattu boundary. But no one has so far protested against that
	

The ensuing uproar caused untold damage to ethnic harmony. Ignored too, was the fact that the Rajapaksa regime, working together with the army, had created a number of Sinhala-Buddhist-only village settlements in the Wilpattu area. The settlement of Bogasweva, consisting of five villages situated within the boundaries of Vavuniya and Anuradhapura districts, and created by carving out part of the Karuvalangkalikulam (Vavuniya) and Padaviya (Apura District) forest reserves, is one example. Over 3000 hectares of protected forest were cleared to make way for this settlement.
The book questions why Wilpattu alone became such a hot topic while Bogasweva was ignored by the media, adding that the clearing was initiated in 2012 by MP Namal Rajapaksa who warned forest conservation officials to keep out till the work was completed. Incidentally, the name Karuvalangkalikulam is derived from karuvala, or ebony tree, for which this reserve was famous. 
It becomes clear that it wasnt the environment but ethnic and religious bigotry which turned Wilpattu into such a sacred cow.
The settlers were Muslims. The controversial settlements were situated in the national parks periphery, not within its boundaries. The book dispels another myth  that Muslim settlers houses were built with money from Arab countries. At Kayakuli and Payakuli, there are signboards in situ indicating project aid from India and the European Union. Then there is a new Sinhala settlement at Pukkulam, which is within the Wilpattu boundary. But no one has so far protested against that.

Then there are myriad peripheral issues, such as cashewnut cultivation within reserve areas. Kondachchy near Mannar with over 1000 acres cleared for cultivation is given as an example. Such cultivation is carried out under the Civil Defence Department, too (the book carries photographs as proof). Apart from being a comprehensive record of the Wilpattu saga and the ensuing environmental and media wars, the book provides a fascinating overview of the entire regions history, culture and folklore.
