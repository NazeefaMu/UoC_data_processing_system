The Silver  Tsunami is  coming!
	
Overviewing the looming crisis of ageing population in Sri Lanka
The phrase Silver Tsunami (also known as The Grey Tsunami or Gray Tsunami) is a metaphor used to describe population ageing. Ageing is inevitable. In the world, the number of people aged 60 years and over has tripled since 1950, reaching 600 million in 2000 and surpassing 700 million in 2006.Its projected that the combined senior and geriatric population will reach 2.1 billion by 2050. 
Sri Lanka, with the highest ageing population in the whole South Asia, has around 14.6 million out of a total of 21 million people who over the age of 55 years. Standard population projections indicate that one in every four persons will be aged 60 years or over by the mid 21st century. 
Apparently, we will soon have an unprecedented problem that the elderly population will soon outnumber the young population, leading to many social, health and economic problems. Is having more elder people in the country a factor that opens windows for new opportunities or is it a crippling challenge to a less developed country like Sri Lanka 
Can we accompany our elder population to a place where they can contribute more to the development of the country through their experiences and maturity or will they be vulnerable to productivity and be more affected with non-communicable diseases of which costs are skyrocketing in the country at the moment The Daily Mirror attempts to create an overview of the emerging challenge and how it can be addressed in an effective way. 
Reasons For The Rise in Ageing Population
Adopting nuclear family norm
Head of Demography Department of Colombo University Senior Lecturer Dr. E.L.Sunethra J. Perera said the phenomenon of population aging is described as the mature stages of the demographic transitional process. 
Sri Lankan families are bound with religious, cultural and traditional norms. From time immemorial, the country has adopted an extended family structure and the fertility ratio was high. The extended families cared for older people in families while a higher number of children was born to families those days. However, as time passed nuclear family norms were adopted, she said. 
Decline in fertility and mortality
She outlined that the changing process of the population age-sex structure in Sri Lanka during the past six decades was determined mainly due to the decline in fertility and mortality rates. Supporting her statement, data of the Department of Census and Statistics showed that the fertility rate which was 5.0 in 1963 has declined to 1.9 by 2000. The rate has kept falling even after 2000. 
Increase in life expectancy
According to The Census Department, up to around 1960, the life expectancy of males was higher than that of females. However, this pattern reversed thereafter and during the period 1996-2001 females show an increase of 4.7 years compared to males. 
The increase in longevity reflected by increasing life expectancy at birth of the Sri Lankan population (for males and females approximately 72 and 78.6 years respectively) indicates a gender disparity of 6.6 years (female live longer than males), Dr. Perera said. These unprecedented demographic transitions caused changes in the population structure, she added. 
impact in old-age dependency and labour force
Dr. Perera stated that the change in age structure and an increasing number of older persons in the population would result in a significant shrinking of the labour force and increase in old-age dependency in the country. Thus, the shape of the population pyramid shifting from triangle to narrow based pyramid would increase the old-age dependency ratio. 
In 2012, there were 60 total dependents including 40 child dependents and 20 old-age dependents. Its hoped that old-age dependency ratio would increase than the child dependency ratio by 2050, she noted. 
Only 62% of the young population is employed. The employment contribution is at a very low level. When it comes to the females, their labour force participation is just 36%. The working population who can be called as young old population should have an employment, so that they will be able to make a living and look after themselves without depending on their families, she remarked.
She also went on to say that eventually, female elders will be more of a burden to the society if they have no way of taking care of themselves financially. 
Pressure on health system
Due to the rise in the ageing population in Sri Lanka, demands and the projected costs for health care of the growing number of elders will undoubtedly rise. As a developing country, having free health sector, this poses a huge challenge to the country in terms of public financing. 
Alarming risk of NCDs
Deputy Director of Non-Communicable Disease Unit (NCD) of the Health Ministry, Dr. Ananthan said there is an increasing risk of Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs) in Sri Lanka. 
Dr. Ananthans statement was established by the finding of a national household survey carried out by the Ministry of Health in collaboration with the World Health Organization (WHO) in 2015. 
According to the survey, more than 90% of the Sri Lankan adults were estimated to have at least one of the NCD risk factors (73.5% with 1-2 risk factors, and 18.3% with 3-5 risk factors), with similar prevalence in males and females. Around 70% of the disease burden in Sri Lanka is due to non-communicable diseases. Nearly thirty percent of total hospital deaths are due to cardiovascular diseases which are the first leading cause of death in Sri Lanka during the past few years. Below are a few of NCDs that are spread throughout the country. 
Raised Blood Glucose - The survey data showed that overall, 83.9% adults were estimated to be taking medicine for Raised Blood Sugar while 16.6% of them are currently on insulin healers. 
Cholesterol - Nearly one fourth of the adults (23.7%) were estimated to either have raised total cholesterol or were currently on medication for raised cholesterol. 75.9% of adults aged between 60 and 69 are on medication for cholesterol. 
Cardiovascular disease - Approximately 9% of the adults aged between 40-69 years were estimated to either have 30% or more 10-year CVD risk or an existing CVD. Only half of those (55.6%) had received drug therapy and counseling to prevent heart attack and stroke. 
High Blood Pressure - Its estimated that 77.8% of the adults with raised blood pressure were on medication.
Retirement and pension
A report of Human Development Unit of The World Bank on Sri Lankas ageing population issue outlined that the coverage of current retirement and pension schemes is limited to a minority of the working age population, the benefits are inadequate, and the financial sustainability of schemes questionable. 
According to the finding of the report, pensions are received by less than one-fifth of the old people and only one-third of the labor force participates in pension scheme, with the vast majority of informal sector workers lacking coverage and considerable evasion among those in the formal sector. 
The report also brings focus on the fact that the civil servants are the only group that has reasonable levels of benefits and longevity insurance, but costs may be unsustainable in the long run. 
The report suggested that more resources have to be set aside for the support of the aged retired population and investment in pre-retirement preparation. In the informal sector comprising 70% employed, only 26% are covered by social security. 
Retirement age likelyto be increased up to 65
Assistant Director of National Secretariat for Elders (NSE) P.D.R.Kulatunga said that the increase in life span of Sri Lankans, which is around 72, hasnt apparently been accompanied by an increase in working lives. He pointed out that as a result of it, many elders have to retire at a certain age even if they are physically able to continue working and contribute more to the countrys economy. 
Later, at the failure to find an opportunity to utilize their experience and maturity in order to make a living, many retired elders are wasting time following retirement, he said. 
Kulatunga said the NSE is currently working on a proposal to increase the retirement age up to 65. The Minister of Social Empowerment, Welfare and Kandyan Heritage S.B.Dissanayake had also given his consent to the said proposal. However, it is still in the process of being finalized, he added. 
Social caring
As the dependency ratio is expected to increase compared to the child dependency ratio by the year of 2050, the burden on those offering primary care might increase significantly. Despite Sri Lanka being a country which has adopted a culture where senior citizens are looked after by their respective families, recently a considerable number of incidents were reported regarding mistreatment and abuse of elders by their family members. 
According to National Charter for Senior Citizens, Sri Lanka, lacks giving adequate attention to senior citizens. This is a matter of grave concern. As possible reasons, the document stated that the decline of traditional care- which derived from religion and culture in Sri Lanka- for senior citizens has diminished. This is due to challenging economic situations, competitive working cultures, changing values and expectations of women; who were originally supposed to look after elders in the respective families now seeking employment. It had underscored middle aged women migrating to The Middle East in search of employment as one of the causes which has severely affected the caring system. 
Assistant Director of the NSE Kulatunga said that although it was believed that living in the presence of ageing parents enhanced emotional bond and also provided a great help in managing the family, advances in education, information technology, influence of media and changing lifestyles have now emerged as causes that discourage people from looking after their parents. This is a tragedy, he stated. 
Abuse of elderlyon the rise
Readers might not forget a heinous act of a daughter who chained her father in a kennel, with three dogs inside, for several years without providing food and other basic requirements, in Kundasale. The incident was reported in 2015 and the daughter was arrested. In April, 2017, a female graduate, who is a development officer, was arrested by the Pallewela Police for allegedly pouring boiling water on her 73-year-old mother. Even recently, a video in which an ageing father was crying and revealing his plight that his children, living in the US, had left him in Sri Lanka went viral in social media. The eyes of anyone with a heart will be wet after watching the video. 
The abuse of elders is still largely a taboo topic not only in Sri Lanka, but also in the entire world. Around 1 in 6 older people experience some form of abuse. This figure is higher compared to previous statistics and the prediction are that it will rise as populations age worldwide, the World Health Organization in June, states in 2017. 
A new study, supported by WHO and published in the Lancet Global Health, has found that almost 16% of people aged 60 years and older were subjected to either psychological abuse (11.6%), financial abuse (6.8%), neglect (4.2%), physical abuse (2.6%) or sexual abuse (0.9%). 
Mushrooming elder care institutions to be regulated
Kulatunga said the NSE is currently working on a National Policy to regulate elder care institutions as many private institutions are mushrooming all over the country to meet the demands. 
He said that there are only six elders homes maintained by the Government. 
We dont encourage the concept of elders homes. The NSE is promoting day care centres for elders. Elders can come every morning to day care centers, engage in different activities, have a quality time and leave in the evening. Its like a school. They shouldnt be confined to the elders homes. We thoroughly advise that the care for elders should be mainly provided by their families, Kulatunga remarked. 
HelpAge to helpthe aged
Among such regulated and non-regulated private organizations, HelpAge is one of the globally accepted and pioneering organizations engaging in this activity. 
The Daily Mirror visited one of day care centres funded by the HelpAge. The H.P. Gooneratne HelpAge Elders Day Care Centre located at Borupana Road, Ratmalana, established in 1988 is one of day care centers funded by the HelpAge. 
Speaking to the Daily Mirror, HelAge Executive Director Samantha Liyanawaduge said that the aged should be empowered, so that they will be able to live with pride and confidence. 
He said that many programmes are carried out by HelpAge for the betterment of helpless senior citizens. 
A strong social pension scheme on contributory basis or non-contributory basis from which the entire ageing population will be covered should be introduced in order to provide them with social security, Liyanawaduge remarked. 
The H.P. Gooneratne Day Care Centre provides a great opportunity for elders to involve themselves in diverse activities, enabling them to maintain their physical and mental status. The elders, who come to the centre, every morning, spenf quality time with the other elders. They engage in religious, social, recreational and other income generating projects that helps boost their mental status. Some of the income generating activities include, making lamp wicks, envelopes, paper bags and cement flower pots etc. Around 40 elders visit the centre daily. 
Bold steps taken by Japan
Japan is already the oldest society on earth. At 83.4 years, Japan has the longest life expectancy at birth in the world. It created very important changes in several fields in order to face the ageing population challenge and to minimize its negative effects to the country. Below are some of the bold steps taken by Japan, according to an article published in the The Globe and Mail.

A revival programme consisting of changes such as getting more women in the workplace, new medical technologies including experimental regenerative medicine and cell therapy. 
	Supplementing its national pension plan with long-term-care insurance (LTCI), where people pay into the system starting in their 40s and are eligible to receive benefits starting at 65, or earlier in the case of illness. 
	A care plan, allowing the patient to choose between competing institutions and service providers offering everything from home visits, bathing and help getting groceries to paying for short stays in hospitals or long-term residence in nursing homes and specialized group homes for dementia patients. 
	A robotic seal called Paro, invented by Takanori Shibata, the chief senior research scientist at Tsukubas National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology. The fuzzy seal has been proven in various settings to reduce anxiety, stress, depression and even patients perception of pain during chemotherapy treatments. 
What needs to be done
Dr. Sunethra Perera of the Colombo University said that the increase in older people will require policies and programmes that can support employment and retirement, health and longterm care, social welfare and social services, in order to reduce the burden of old-age dependency on the working-age population of the country. 
Meanwhile, the World Bank Report on the Sri Lankas Ageing Population underscored that the increase of womens participation by 20 percent could delay the reduction of the labor force by 15 years. 
More work is needed to examine the obstacles in the way of employing ageing workers (inflexible labor laws, etc.) and to determine whether other employers have negative perceptions about the adaptability and productivity of older workers. It must also be found out whether employing the aged will create work disincentives and how important an obstacle is weak employability with regard to old workers  and if so, what should be done about it, the report stated.  
We want to help abandoned elders to reunite with their families. Those who are physically able should have a means to make a living. A strong social pension scheme on contributory base or non-contributory base from which the entire ageing population will be covered should be introduced in order to provide them with social security.

Thousands of devotees at St. Annes, Thalawila
	
When the overnight dew had settled down and the hush of silence fell upon the massive crowds of faith and the Holy Mass commenced, they all felt the spiritual presence of St. Anne. Many went back spiritually healed and others leaving behind their worries at her feet. 
It was amazing and true when it happened at the annual festival of St. Anne where she appeared symbolically at Thalawila with thousands of devotees flocking to see and hear their gentle shepherd, Rt. Rev. Dr. Valence Mendis and Rt. Rev. Noel Emmanual, Lord Bishop of Trincomalee and a visiting Bishop from Jordan, Rt. Rev. Lord Bishop Maroon Lahm who led the Holy Mass. Bishop Valence started off the service invoking peace and blessings of the Lord upon the beleaguered nation people:
You must trust in the Lord and not be afraid to surrender yourself to him in faith and he will look after you when you experience peace of mind and protection from evil: The Bishop touched on the sufferings of the poor and in lighter vein quipped We do not need mosquitoes probably referring to the deadly dengue but he said: Take a look at the poor fishermen who battle with the deep sea risking their lives and come back without a haul only to starve with their families. So are the farmers and rest of the poor but if you all trust in the Lord, you shall not starve. 
Bishop Emmanuel read a passage from the Bishop referring to the spiritual upbringing by Anne, her daughter, Virgin Mary in nurturing her towards the future preparation of the Holy Conception.  
Resplendently decked in flowers, St. Annes chariot led the way out escorted by the cadets of the Ceylon Navy and followed by the three Bishop who participated at the Holy Mass, wondrously organized by the parish priest, Rev. Fr. Nelson Samantha who spared no pains to make the day spiritually memorable.

Trade Union actions inevitable - GMOA
	
While claiming that the President had not issued any statement mentioning the stance of the government on South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM), the Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) said that they would launch trade union actions in near future.
Addressing the media, member of the Media Committee of the GMOA Dr. Prasad Colombage said that the Attorney-General's Department (AG's Dept.) had turned a blind eye to command the government to announce its stance on SAITM and adding the political elements had mislead both the AG's department and the government to come out with reasonable solutions over the issue.
Meanwhile, GMOA Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge stressed the government was deliberately delaying to issue the stance on SAITM by virtue of the whims and fancies of some politicians and responsible officials.
We have almost come to the edge of this struggle to insist the government to abolish SAITM. But, we have not lost our grip and therefore, we are prepared to launch protest marches and vehicle parades followed by massive island wide trade union actions in near future, he warned.

AIA Insurance tops MDRT in Sri Lanka, crosses 100 member mark
	
AIA Sri Lanka has crossed 100 MDRT (Million Dollar Round Table) members for 2016, making it the first and only insurer in Sri Lanka to do so.
AIA has the most number of MDRT members in Sri Lanka, with a total of 110 MDRT certificates awarded to AIA Wealth Planners and Bancassurance Executives in 2016. This achievement is testament to the high calibre of advisors recruited, trained and employed by AIA, to provide the best protection and savings solutions to Sri Lankans.
This is the second consecutive year that AIA tops MDRT from Sri Lanka. MDRT is internationally recognised as the standard of excellence in the life insurance and financial services business. Its members are required to generate a certain high level of premium, commission and income and demonstrate exceptional professional knowledge, strict ethical conduct and exceptional client service. This achievement is therefore a fitting acknowledgement of the relentless commitment and the high level of professionalism shown by AIAs advisors who, for the second successive year, helped AIA Insurance become the number-one MDRT in Sri Lanka.
CEO Pankaj Banerjee said: We are in the business of helping people protect their families, access the best healthcare and enjoy their retirement to the fullest - this is no easy task and it is truly commendable that our advisors are able to not only positively impact peoples lives but also be recognised as being the best of the best. Our advisors are renowned for providing the highest standards of professional service and we continue to support their development by offering high quality training programmes, hiring and retaining top talent and providing the most advanced tools for enhanced efficiency and productivity, he added.
Deputy CEO Upul Wijesinghe who is AIAs Chief Agency Officer stated We adopt a diligent process when recruiting to ensure we have the very best joining our team. We also have an intense and holistic training process to ensure 100 percent competence as well as the necessary technology in place to enable ease-of-doing-business for the Wealth Planners as well as the customers.

Brazil lawsuit accuses Jagath Jayasuriya of war crimes
	
Human rights groups led by the International Truth and Justice Project (ITJP), in South America have filed war crimes lawsuits against former General Jagath Jayasuriya who is now Sri Lankan ambassador to Brazil, Al Jazeera reported today.
The lawsuits against Jayasuriya alleged that he oversaw military units that attacked hospitals and killed, disappeared and tortured thousands of people in the final phase of the war in 2009.
Jayasuriya has diplomatic immunity in Brazil and five other countries where he is ambassador - Colombia, Peru, Chile, Argentina and Suriname.
But the groups pursuing the suits hope they will compel regional governments to open investigations of Jayasuriya, remove his immunity and expel him, the article said.
Carlos Castresana Fernandez, the lawyer who is coordinating the effort, has told a foreign news agency that suits have been filed on Monday in Brazil and Colombia.
Petitions will be filed in Argentina, Chile and Peru in the coming days, he said, adding that authorities in Suriname had refused to accept the petition.
"This is one genocide that has been forgotten, but this will force democratic countries to do something. This is just the beginning of the fight," Fernandez said.
Al Jazeera said calls to the Sri Lankan embassy in Brazil went unanswered Monday evening as did an email seeking comment.
The suits say Jayasuriya was the commander of the Vanni Security Force from 2007 to 2009.
According to the suits, Jayasuriya oversaw an offensive from Joseph Camp in the northern town of Vavuniya.
The ITJP said it interviewed 14 people who survived torture or sexual violence at the camp.
"There is no way General Jayasuriya can claim not to have known that torture routinely occurred in his camp; there were purpose built underground torture chambers, equipped with manacles, chains and pulleys for hoisting victims upside down. If the detainees could hear each other screaming at night from adjacent buildings, so could he," ITJP's Executive Director Yasmin Sooka said in March.

DAILY MAIL, 28 August, 2017 - Venezuelas close ally China said on Monday that history shows external interference and unilateral sanctions only make things more complex and will not help resolve problems, after the United States imposed new sanctions on Venezuela. 
U.S. President Donald Trump signed an executive order that prohibits dealings in new debt from the Venezuelan government or its state oil company on Friday in an effort to halt financing that the White House said fuels President Nicolas Maduros dictatorship. 
Maduro, who has frequently blamed the United States for waging an economic war on Venezuela, said the United States was seeking to force Venezuela to default - but he said it would not succeed.The present problem in Venezuela should be resolved by the Venezuelan government and people themselves, she told a daily news briefing.

In the wake of the policy decision to lease the Mattala airport to an Indian company, the government is in contact with India to work out modalities on how best to develop it.
A Cabinet source told Daily Mirror that a subcommittee was appointed for this purpose and that though there were various proposals, no final agreement had been reached up to now.
The establishment of a flying school integrated with the airport or an aircraft maintenance plant is among the proposals.
The source said, the government was considering the possibility of for other purposes rather than restricting its use for commercial flight operations.

Corrupt persons in the legal system panicking over my statements: Ranjan
	
Deputy Minister Ranjan Ramanayake today said only the corrupted law enforcement officers start panicking when one talks about corruption in the judiciary.
Mr. Ramanayake told a media briefing that lawyers who have not done any wrong should not get alarmed about his recent statement that legal personnel are amongst the worst corrupted people in this country.
Bar Association of Sri Lanka Chairman U R De Silva has threatened me by saying they will file legal action against me for contempt of court. I respect the judiciary, the judicial officers and the law. I clearly state that I have not made any statement which could be subjected to contempt of court. What has taken place is nothing but misunderstanding. I only referred to what Upul Jayasuriya, J C Weliamuna and Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and what President Sirisena had said before. Late Prime Minister John Kotelawala said he would apply tar on the heads of corrupted monks. He said all monks should not panic about this statement. Likewise only corrupted judges and lawyers should panic about my statement. There are judges whom we could worship including the Jaffna High Court Judge. We can do the same to late Sarath Ambeypitiya, he said.
We saw how those who held the Chief Justice post in the past behaved. Buddha preached that when a king gets corrupted his ministers suffer the same fate so will the others including the citizens of the country. Chief Justice is the king of judges. Judges will have to obey the Chief Justice. A former Chief Justice has assured the head of state that he will deliver any judgement according to whims and fancies of the latter if his term is extended. This is a perfect example of corruption. Former Chief Justice and his wife were hovering around the President and Prime minister at the airport during the day the Pope visited Sri Lanka. They did it so that he could remain as the Chief Justice, I saw this with my own eyes, he added.
Mr. Ramanayake said he believes that these cases filed against him will do some good to him. This he said because he represents the people. My statements are based on what people come and tell me about lawyers.
People suffer as a result of shortcomings in the judiciary. There are instances where wrong verdicts are given. There are instances where sexual bribes are given. A judge had been accused of raring a servant. People talk about them. A former Chief Justice admitted that he gave a wrong judgement during his tenure. What did the BASL chief do about these judicial officers and lawyers. Arent we going to penalize these judicial officers There are instances where people threw excreta at judges. Some Sri Lankan lawyers have been identified as ones who hold black money by Panama papers. I am going to be penalized when I talk about them. Wrong doers are spared, he also said.
Mr. Ramanayake called for an institution where people could go when they are subjected to harassment from the judicial officers and lawyers. He said lawyers should not defend anyone who is charged with gang rape and this practice should be enforced in Sri Lanka as well. (Yohan Perera)

Dozens killed, wounded by car bomb in Afghan province
	

Afghanistan, (REUTERS), 28 August, 2017 - As many as 13 people, including both Afghan army soldiers and civilians, were killed and 18 wounded by a car bomb in the southern province of Helmand on Sunday, officials said. 
Omar Zwak, the Helmand governors spokesman who gave the casualty figures, said the attack occurred in a market in Nawa, a district in the center of the province, which has seen heavy fighting in recent weeks as government forces have battled for control with Taliban insurgents. 
Afghan forces said they had retaken Nawa district in July but there has been continued fighting in the area since. 
There was no claim of responsibility and no immediate comment from the Taliban, which has carried out regular suicide attacks in Helmand, where it controls much of the area outside the provincial capital Lashkar Gah.

Heavy clashes  in last pocket of  IS fighters near Tal Afar
	

DAILY MAIL, 28 August, 2017- Iraqi forces engaged in heavy fighting Monday near Tal Afar with the last pocket of Islamic State group jihadists in the northern province of Nineveh. 
An AFP journalist saw fierce clashes pitting Iraqi government forces and allied militia against IS fighters in the town of Al-Ayadieh 15 kilometres (10 miles) north of Tal Afar. Iraqi troops, police and special forces, allied with the Hashed al-Shaabi paramilitary coalition, took control of all districts inside Tal Afar on Sunday, a week after launching their latest offensive against an IS stronghold. Clearing operations were continuing and Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi was expected to soon arrive in the city to announce its liberation from IS. The jihadists launched three suicide car bomb attacks at Iraqi forces on Monday morning and smoke could be seen rising above the town from air strikes carried out in support of ground troops.

Houston battles unprecedented floods
	

The full extent of Hurricane Harveys aftermath started to come into chilling focus Sunday in Houston and across much of central Texas, as rain measured in feet, not inches, overwhelmed lakes, rivers and bayous, leaving several people dead and thousands displaced in a weather disaster described as beyond anything experienced. 
Across the nations fourth-largest city and suburbs many miles away, families scrambled to get out of their fast-flooding homes. Rescuers - in many cases helping neighbours - in fishing boats, huge dump trucks and even front-end loaders battled driving rains to move people to shelter. Some used inflatable toys to ferry their families out of inundated neighbourhoods, wading through chest-deep water on foot while the region was under near-constant tornado watches. 
By Sunday afternoon, the National Weather Service -was predicting that parts of Texas could receive nearly 50 inches of rain, the largest recorded total in the states history.
It also warned that Harveys relentless downpours were expected to continue until late in the week and that flooding could become much more severe. More than 82,000 homes were without electricity in the Houston area by Sunday night as airports shuttered and hospitals planned evacuations. 
Officials said Houston, a major center for the nations energy industry, had suffered billions of dollars in damage and would take years to fully recover.-Houston

IRB will have negative impact on Sri Lankans: Bandula
	
The Inland Revenue (Amendment) Bill (IRB) which is to be tabled in Parliament next week weighted in favour of foreigners and a disadvantage to Sri Lankans, MP Bandula Gunawardane said today.
He told a joint opposition news briefing that according to the new Bill, Sri Lankans working abroad would be taxed when they bring in their wealth to the country.
However, foreigners working here will be exempted from taxes when they take away their income out of the country. This is not rational, the MP said.
He said the Bill would adversely impact on low-income families because those who are with an annual income of Rs.600,000 would be taxed 4% of their annual income.
The MP said senior citizens and those engaged in crop cultivation would also be severely affected by the new amendments.
Fixed Deposits, mostly maintained by senior citizens as a major source of income in the evening of their life, had also been victimized by the new taxes. The minimum withholding tax which was 2.5% for FDs would be increased to 5% while farmers and others engaged in agriculture or corp cultivation will be taxed when they obtain a bigger loan. This would be the first time a farmer will have to pay a tax for the financial concessions they receive, he said. (By Lahiru Pothmulla)

Islamic State readies to evacuate Syria-Lebanon border zone
	

DAILY MAIL, 28 August, 2017 - The Syrian army and Hezbollah on Monday prepared to escort Islamic State fighters to eastern Syria from their enclave on the border with Lebanon under an agreement following a week-long offensive against the jihadist group.

It will end any Sunni militant presence on the border, an important goal for Lebanon and the Shiite Hezbollah group, and is the first time Islamic State has publicly agreed to a forced evacuation from territory it held in Syria. 
Ambulances carrying 25 injured IS fighters began moving to a marshalling point for the evacuation convoy, a media unit run by Hezbollah reported, while buses to carry the militants and their family members also moved into the area, a witness said. 
Islamic State agreed a ceasefire on Sunday with the Lebanese army on one front and the Syrian army and Hezbollah on the other after losing much of its mountainous enclave straddling the border, paving the way for its evacuation.

## Title: North Korea fires missile over Japan

North Korea fires missile over Japan
	
SEOUL, South Korea  North Korea carried out one of its most provocative missile tests in recent years early Tuesday morning, hurling a ballistic missile directly over Japan that prompted the government in Tokyo to warn residents in its path to take cover.
The missile flew over the northern island of Hokkaido and landed harmlessly in the sea, after a flight of nearly 1,700 miles. But the propaganda value for the North Koreans was considerable.
Public television programs in Japan were interrupted with a rare warning screen announcing the missiles flight over the country. Several bullet train lines were temporarily halted, and the government spoke of the missile  only the third North Korean projectile to fly over the country since 1998  in unusually dire terms.
North Koreas reckless action of launching a missile that passed over Japan is an unprecedented, serious and grave threat, said Japans prime minister, Shinzo Abe. He later told reporters that he had spoken by telephone with President Trump. Japan and the U.S. stances are completely matched, he said, adding that they discussed ways to tighten pressure on North Korea.
The test was a direct challenge to Mr. Trump. Just last week, at a political rally in Arizona, Mr. Trump suggested that his threat to rain down fire and fury on North Korea if it endangered the United States was beginning to bear fruit. Kim Jong-un, the North Korean leader, was starting to respect us, Mr. Trump said.
Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson had also cited a pause in testing by the North, saying he was pleased to see that the regime in Pyongyang has certainly demonstrated some level of restraint that we have not seen in the past. Mr. Tillerson suggested that it could be a pathway to dialogue.
Only days later, that optimism seemed premature when the North Koreans launched three short-range missiles on Saturday. Two of them traveled about 155 miles before splashing down, far enough to reach major South Korean and American military bases, including those about 60 miles south of Seoul.
And while North Korea has not carried out its threat to fire four of its ballistic missiles toward the coast of Guam  and near an American air base  the missile it fired over Japan on Tuesday appeared to be of the same type: an intermediate-range missile that could target American, South Korean and Japanese bases in northeast Asia.
Only twice before has the North fired projectiles over Japanese territory: once in 1998, prompting a minor diplomatic crisis in Asia, and once again at the beginning of the Obama administration in 2009. In both those cases, the North said the rockets were carrying satellites into orbit. In this case, it made no such claim.
As in the case of the 2009 launch, which was paired with a nuclear weapons test, North Korea appears to be testing a new American president.
Notably, the missile fired on Tuesday took off from near Pyongyang, the North Korean capital. Early reports, which are often later corrected, indicated that it was launched from a site near Pyongyangs international airport, not the usual launch site in the countrys northeast, according to the South Korean military. They said they were still trying to determine what type of missile was launched.
American officials noted that if it was in fact launched from the outskirts of the capital, it may have been meant to complicate recent American threats to hit the North with pre-emptive strikes. That possibility was explicitly raised this month by several Trump administration officials, as a way of seeking to deter the North Koreans.
While the Norths usual launch sites are in remote areas, where there would be little concern about civilian casualties, any strike near Pyongyang would risk many civilian deaths and would suggest the real goal was to strike at the regime.
An attack near Pyongyang would also be far more likely to result in North Korean retaliation against Seoul.
Lt. Gen. Hiroaki Maehara, commander of Japans Air Self Defense Force, said that Japan did not try to shoot down the missile from North Korea on Tuesday because the government did not detect a threat to Japanese territory.
But when its surveillance first detected the launch and followed the path of the missile, Japan warned citizens in its path to take cover  just in case any parts fell on Japanese territory.
The North Korean missile tests on Saturday and again on Tuesday came during joint military drills that the United States and South Korea started a week ago. For the United States and South Korea, these drills  mostly conducted on computer screens  are normal exercises. But the North calls such annual drills a rehearsal for invasion and often lashes out with weapons trials and military exercises of its own.
But in this case, it was Japan  not part of this exercise  that seemed most directly affected.
In a statement, Mr. Abe said his government was prepared to take all the measures to protect peoples lives.
We have lodged a firm protest to North Korea. We have requested an urgent meeting of the U.N. Security Council, he added. Diplomats said the meeting would most likely be held Tuesday afternoon.
The Japanese government sent a text alert to citizens about the launch and advised them to take protective cover. In a post on Mr. Abes Twitter account, the government confirmed that the missile was fired at 5:58 a.m. local time, before breaking into three pieces and landing about 730 miles off the coast of Cape Erimo on Hokkaido, around 6:12 a.m.
Takaaki Uesugi, a security guard at the town hall of Erimo, on the southern tip of Hokkaido, said he first heard about the launch from an alert on his phone and worried that debris would fall in his town.
Im really worried about how America will react, he said. Its possible that Japan could be dragged into a dangerous situation depending on how President Trump responds to this.
A woman in Tokyo, Kaoru Kuroko, also said she had heard an alarm on her telephone soon after the missile was launched. It was scary, she said. I wondered, where will the missile go to
South Korea said it was ready to defend itself from the North Korean threat. North Korea must come to the negotiating table, realizing that denuclearization is its only way to ensure its security and economic development, the South Korean Foreign Ministry said in a statement on Tuesday.
With China to the west and Russia to the north, North Korea can flight-test its mid- or intermediate-range missiles only to the south or to the east, analysts said.
In a way, this was a hard choice to make for the North because it meant to fire the missile over Japan or toward Guam, said Kim Yong-hyun, a professor of North Korean studies at Dongguk University in Seoul. In the end, it chose to fire over Japan, demonstrating its capability to launch a missile to Guam but without actually launching one in that direction, which would have been a huge provocation to the United States.
North Korea has conducted more than 80 missile tests since Mr. Kim came to power in late 2011, after the death of his father, but it has not sent any of those missiles over Japan.
Even when it flight-tested an intercontinental ballistic missile on July 28, it was launched at a highly lofted angle so that the missile reached an altitude of 2,300 miles. But it flew only 998 horizontal miles, falling in waters between the North and Japan. The North said at the time that it did so in order not to send its missile over a neighbor. Thus, the missile test on Tuesday was considered an especially bold move.
Along with South Korea, Japan and Guam would most likely be the first targets of a North Korean attack should war break out on the Korean Peninsula, analysts said. Both are home to major American military bases, which will become key launching pads for American forces in the event of war in Korea. (nytimes)

Post crowd violence in Pallekele: ICC seeks security assurance
	
ICC Match Referee Andy Pycroft has reportedly sought security assurance from the Sri Lankan cricket board for the remainder of the limited-overs series against India following boorish fan behaviour during the third ODI in Pallekele on Sunday.
Irate fans, angered by the Sri Lankan cricket teams continued poor performances, threw water bottles into the ground as India reached within eight runs of winning the match and sealing the five-match series.
Play was halted for over 30 minutes while riot police arrived and escorted fans in the grass banks. Both teams returned to finish the game.
A Sri Lanka Cricket spokesman said he had not received any specific information while adding: He (Pycroft) may have generally spoken about it.
A group of fans also blocked the Sri Lankan team bus following their nine-wicket defeat in the first ODI at Dambulla on August 20.
The next two ODIs and a one-off Twenty20 game will be played at the Premadasa Stadium in Colombo. The stadium had witnessed a fight between two groups of fans in 2015, during a one-day international between Sri Lanka and Pakistan.
ICC Match Referee Javagal Srinath had halted the game after a stone was hurled on to the field of play following a fight in the terraced area of the stadium while Sri Lanka batted.
While police stopped violent spectators inside the stadium, others were throwing stones from outside the venue. Play resumed and Pakistan went on to win the game.

PTL tampered with phone recording system: ASG
	
Additional Solicitor General Dappula de Livera today requested the PCoI to take appropriate legal action against Perpetual Treasuries Limited (PTL) and its CEO Kasun Palisena under Contempt of Commission for fabricating material submitted as evidence.
This request was made after Metropolitan Ltd confirmed that the original recording system installed by Metropolitan Limited at PTL stored all details relating to caller IDs and call times, contrary to the evidence submitted by the PTL CEO and its IT officer.
ASG de Livera informed the PCoI that Metropolitan Ltd had inspected the recording system of PTL and submitted a report on August 28, 2017 as directed by the Commission.
Metropolitan Ltd said the recording system had been re-installed on July 6, 2017 without informing the service provider (Metropolitan) while the backup system had also been re-installed on the same day.
The report says the original system had the options to identify the caller ID and the time duration as opposed to what PTL CEO and its IT officer had testified earlier.
The ASG said PTL IT officer Sachith Devathanthri, in his statement to the PCoI on August 28, 2017 said he was unaware about such re-installation.
He said he was of the view that the re-installation had taken place on the very same day that PTL was suspended by the CBSL from business activities as a primary dealer in government securities.
ASG Livera said he was of the view that PTL had tampered with the data during the re-installation process and subsequently submitted fabricated material to the PCoI.
Earlier, PTL CEO Kasun Palisena had submitted an affidavit with the assistance of the IT officer Devathanthri and informed the Commission that its recording system did not show any details of the caller number or time duration other than the serial number of each call.
Therefore, the ASG asked the PCoI to take appropriate legal action under Contempt of Commission against the witness and PTL.
It was also revealed that the CID officers had taken over the current computer in which the systems software was running. However, the ASG said they had found that the current computer was not the one PTL had used before July 2017 and therefore requested the Commission to issue an appropriate order to obtain the old computer which was used in the phone recording systems software and data base.
The ASG said they could prove the allegations by way of an affidavit from the Metropolitan Chief Engineer and subsequently Metropolitan Ltd Chief Engineer Nalin Dharmaratne testified before the Commission explaining the matter.
Additional Solicitor General Yasantha Kodagoda led the evidence.
Mr. Dharmaratne said Metropolitan Ltd had installed a phone recording system at PTL on June 2015 which had the capacity of receiving calls from both digital lines and analog lines to the extensions at PTLs office.
Initially, PTL had only eight ports for the extensions and subsequently in September 2016 another 16 ports had been installed by Metropolitan Ltd.
The incoming and outgoing calls were routed through these 24 extensions using both Digital and Analog lines. Thereafter those call details go through another two devices attached to the extensions and finally saved in a main computer which has a voice logger system.
These devices were also provided by Metropolitan Ltd as PTLs service provider.
The witness explained that all voice recordings of calls go to one folder file as wave format in the main computer while all call details relating to those calls are also saved in a different format as data base.
He confirmed that every call detail, such as caller number (incoming or out going), time duration and date will be in the data base of the recording system which Metropolitan Ltd had initially installed in the system with all those facilities.
He explained the method to be used to extract the previous call data by using the software options (backup data) of the recording system.
Mr. Dharmaratne said that after a complaint was lodged by PTL in June 2015 they had examined the system and prepared it by December 2015. The complaint was about some missing digits of outgoing numbers which were recorded in the system.
However, PTL had earlier only provided its voice recordings with sequential serial numbers to the PCoI. During Last Fridays cross examination, DSG Milinda Gunathilake pointed out that some phone conversations were missing from the recordings that PTL had provided.
On being questioned by ASG Kodagoda yesterday, Mr. Dharmaratane said they had identified a re-installation of the software on July 6 ,2017
When they were examining the back up data, the witness said they had identified that the previous voice recordings (wave files) had been replaced in the data base.
He said it could have been done by copying voice recordings from the wave folder before the re-installation. He said all other call data other than the voice recordings had subsequently been deleted in the re-installation process.
The witness said such re-installation and re-positioning had been identified by the Indian mother company of the system by accessing the system online.
When Justice Prasanna Jayawardena questioned the witness, he said that PTL could have easily asked Metropolitan Ltd's assistance if they wanted to carry out a re-installation. Justice Jayawardena highlighted the fact that according to the service agreement with Metropolitan Ltd, PTL was also prohibited from making any modification or alteration to the system without informing the service provider.
Justice Jayawardena: Have you come across such an incident before
Witness: No I have not come across such an incident in Sri Lanka with regard to our customers.
When ASG Kodagoda showed details provided by PTL CEO and its IT expert in an affidavit to the PCoI and questioned whether they were true or false, the witness said they were not technically true according to the phone recording system he had installed at PTL.
Presidents Counsel Kalinga Indatissa who was appearing for PTL CEO Kasuna Palisena subsequently requested time to cross examine the witness as he had to obtain instructions from technical experts on the matter. (Shehan Chamika Silva)

Rest In Power, Vijay
	
The Collective for Economic Democratisation in Sri Lanka is deeply saddened by the untimely passing away of our comrade Vijay Nagaraj on Friday, August 25. 
An erudite and eloquent advocate of redistributive politics and economic democracy, Vijay was an active member of the Collective, leading many initiatives challenging structural inequalities and dispossession of the poor. 
He made a significant contribution to an ongoing debate on Economic, Social and Cultural rights within the constitutional reform process. 
Vijays engagement with peoples movements in India, principally the Mazdoor Kisan Shakti Sangathan (MKSS), the breadth of his intellectual interests and a razor-sharp intellect, made a unique contribution to activism in Sri Lanka. 
He was ardent in his opposition to neoliberalism, and stood firmly for democratic participation of the marginalised. Among his interactions with progressive trade unions in understanding and responding to contemporary challenges, he was most recently involved in struggles against precarious labour and in evolving a broad campaign against privatisation, particularly Public-Private Partnerships. 
Vijay firmly believed in the centrality of class politics, but was never unwilling to engage with civil society organisations and activists of contrary persuasion; constantly sharpening his own analysis and arguments while contributing to theirs. When he disagreed with someone, he was at once candid and graceful. 
He was a remarkably affectionate person, who formed many close friendships during his time in Sri Lanka. He had a knack for connecting with different people with gusto, becoming part of their families and lives, and accompanying them in their own trials and joys. 
Vijays passing is an irreparable loss to the Collective and to the many other groups and networks in which he was dynamic. We extend our sympathy and solidarity to his family and friends in our shared grief. Rest In Power, Vijay.

Speaking to journalists after a discussion with State Minister for Foreign Affairs Wasantha Senanayake, Mr. Liyanage said that some parents of students attending the Stafford Sri Lankan School in Doha had alleged the administration of the school was fraudulently collecting money from the students there.
They said the administration was using the name of the Embassy to collect funds from the students. But none of these funds had been used to provide much needed infrastructure facilities to the school, he said.
As a solution to the issue, Mr. Liyanage said the school would not be closed down and that the Foreign Ministry had directed the Embassy to take over the school from September 10 under a sponsorship programme. We appoint a board of directors and administrators from among the parents for the school and it will be they who will control the funds on behalf of the school, he said.
Liyanage went on to say the embassy had received numerous complaints about the current administration's unfair treatment of students. The embassy had to equip the school with an air-conditioning system and a laboratory recently.
The Qatar government has donated a piece of land to construct a new building for the school. As the President is scheduled to visit Qatar on October 26, the laying of the cornerstone for the school building will take place during his visit, the ambassador said.
Discussions were also held with the Foreign Ministry to ensure that students who get good grades at the school are given the opportunity to enter Sri Lankan Universities to pursue their higher studies.
The school was inaugurated in October 2001 and since 2011 it has been affiliated to the Sri Lankan community and runs as a non-profit organisation. It is being run on a rented premises and has around 1,200 students. The school follows the Edexcel Curriculum. (Darshana Sanjeewa)

SL cricket selection committee resigns
	
The Sanath Jayasuriya-led National Cricket Selection Committee quit today after handing over their letter of resignation to the Sports Minister Dayasiri Jayasekera, calling the ugly incident that took place towards the end of Sundays third ODI against India in Pallekele as the last straw.
The committee comprising, Jayasuriya, Romesh Kaluwitharana, Ranjith Madurusinghe, Eric Upashantha and Cricket Manager Asanka Gurusinha were two months into a six-month extension which was to end in December.
In the letter, written on behalf of the committee, Jayasuriya said it was painful to see the fans reacting the way they did  throwing plastic bottles onto the field  with Sri Lanka heading towards another defeat.
As a player who has represented the country at all levels and as a former Captain and currently Chairman of Selectors, last Sunday's incident at the ground was the last straw, the Chairman of Selectors wrote.
Cricket has been and will always be my life so it was particularly painful to see our own fans attack our own players.
The Selection Committees policies had come under severe criticism for the teams performances over the last year, having suffered embarrassing defeats in South Africa, and at home to Bangladesh, Zimbabwe and India.
I acknowledge that it has been a very disappointing year, Jayasuriya said, adding, However, just one year ago we beat Australia at home 3-0. This was an unforgettable moment. We have some very talented boys and I am sure in time they will take cricket to the heights that it once was.
He also called on fans to support the team during this difficult period.
We go with our eyes full of tears but with our heads held high. To all the fans we say please have faith in the boys they will deliver to the boys we say believe in your ability and believe in the fans they will be with you ultimately, Jayasuriya also wrote.
Meanwhile, Lasith Malinga was handed over the captaincy for the fourth ODI in Colombo on Thursday, after stand-in Skipper Chamara Kapugedera was ruled out with an injury.
"Malinga will captain the team and since Dinesh Chandimal and Danushka Gunathilaka are both out, we have called up Dilshan Munaweera to the squad, Jayasuriya told the Daily Mirror. (Shehan Daniel)

Spark: Transforming the actuarial services landscape in Sri Lanka
	
One of the main challenges faced by the financial sector is quantitative assessment of future risk.
Financial risk can arise due to unpredictable nature of factors such as interest rate and default rate.
An insurance company, on the other hand, is exposed to a multitude of additional risks such as mortality, longevity, and natural hazards. An actuary is a highly trained business professional who is uniquely qualified to quantitatively assess these risks and make decisions on product pricing and reserving. Actuaries provide assessments of financial systems, with a focus on returns, views on future economic conditions, and chances of realization.
Globally recognized and a highly sought-after profession, actuaries use skills and expertise developed through an arduous professional qualification process. Although a relatively unheard-of profession in Sri Lanka, actuaries are an integral part of an insurance business. However, due to the time and effort required to be a fully qualified actuary, the profession has experienced slow growth in Sri Lanka. To be a qualified actuary, one is required to complete around 15 exams of a recognized professional body, such as the Society of Actuaries of US and the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries of UK, and have worked under qualified actuaries to gain necessary experience.
Additionally, they are expected to meet professionalism standards and continuous professional development criteria set by these organizations.
There are currently less than 10 fully qualified actuaries practicing in Sri Lanka. At the same time, the demand for actuarial expertise has grown exponentially due to changing regulatory requirements, as well as the dynamic and competitive nature of the financial services industry.
Insurance companies in particular, stand to benefit immensely by integrating the actuarial function as part of their core operations and involving actuarial expertise in strategic decisions. This requires diverse global experience coupled with an understanding of local market dynamics.
Taking these factors in to consideration, Dr. Milanthi Sarukkali who has over 10 years of experience as a life actuary and is a Fellow of the Society of Actuaries, USA, with a Ph.D. in actuarial science from University of Connecticut, founded Spark Actuarial and Risk Consultants in 2015. It is the largest actuarial consulting firm in Sri Lanka and is a timely answer to the growing demand from the local financial services industry.
Led by Dr. Milanthi Sarukkali, Spark prides itself on a team of fully qualified actuaries working in the life, health and general insurance sectors. Sparks senior team includes four fellows from the Society of Actuaries, Institute and Faculty of Actuaries and the Casualty Actuarial Society. Maureen Tresnak who leads the healthcare vertical of Spark, has over 20 years of experience in the US, many of which have been supporting Medicare, a government sponsored insurance programme for the elderly. Steven Glicksman, a veteran in the property and casualty space, leads the general insurance vertical, and is passionate about providing strategic input to clients on product design and pricing. He is particularly skilled in working with emerging markets, specialized risks and incomplete data. Dr. Shayanthan Pathmanathan, who supports the life insurance vertical, has extensive experience in the life insurance sector particularly in asset-liability management (ALM) and Solvency II. He is a fellow of the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries, and holds a Ph.D. in Mathematics from the University of Oxford.
Dr. Milanthi Sarukkali notes, Our team in Sri Lanka has been successfully providing off-shore support to large global insurers in the U.S. and Asia for almost two years. Spark adheres to global professionalism, standards, processes and quality controls to ensure that the services we provide are on par with international requirements.
Our aim is to also develop the actuarial profession in Sri Lanka through mentoring, providing global exposure and guidance, and support for obtaining actuarial science designations.
