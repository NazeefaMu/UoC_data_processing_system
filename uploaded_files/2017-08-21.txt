23 dead, over 400 injured
	
?
At least 23 persons were killed and around 400 injured when 14 coaches of the Puri-Haridwar Utkal Express derailed on Saturday evening at Khatauli, near Muzaffarnagar, Uttar Pradesh police officials said. ??
It was 5.46 p.m. on Saturday when the Haridwar- bound train derailed immediately after it crossed the Khatauli station. ??
National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) personnel told The Hindu that the number of dead could rise as several passengers were still trapped in the wreckage. Officials said 100 persons were seriously injured. Rescue operations have slowed down after darkness. ??
The Railway Ministry is yet to comment on the reason for the accident but the impact of the accident was strong enough to send a derailed coach crashing into a house in Jagat colony, a railway colony next to the tracks. ??
Senior Railway Ministry officials present on the spot told The Hindu that ?though the investigation was yet to be concluded but preliminary probe suggests that the driver of the Kalinga Express had applied sudden breaks as he found repair works going on the track which led to the accident. ??
This is the second serious train derailment case in Uttar Pradesh in the last few months. In November last year, 14 coaches of the Patna-bound Indore-Rajendranagar Express train derailed in Uttar Pradesh, killing 152 passengers and injuring 183. ??

Don't vote for IR Bill: MR to SLFP
	
Former president Mahinda Rajapaksa today urged Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) MPs to vote against the Inland Revenue Bill when it was taken up in Parliament on Friday.
In a statement he said, ?Under Clause 5(2)(f) of the Bill, the employer?s contribution to a provident fund will be considered a part of an employee?s taxable income. This will make EPF payments a burden to employees. Under Item 8 of its First Schedule, the tax on income generated by provident funds through their investments will increase from the present 10% to 14% thus reducing the income available to fund members.
?The tax exemption granted to all places of worship has been dropped in the proposed law and Item 6 of the First Schedule has fixed the tax for such charitable institutions at 14%. According to the Third and Fifth Schedules, places of worship and charitable institutions will be eligible for a tax concession only if the money is used to provide care to children, the elderly or the disabled. The incomes of some places of worship are supervised by the government and such institutions will be taxed to the maximum whereas other places of worship not supervised by the government will be able to escape the tax net. Such discriminatory practices will give rise to social tensions.
"Furthermore, the existing 2006 Inland Revenue Act provides concessions through Chapter III on tax exemptions to various fields deemed worthy of preservation such as local handicraft industries, film and drama producers etc. This Chapter also has concessions for various economic activities such as new undertakings in pharmaceuticals, renewable energy, production for import substitution etc. There are over 200 such exemptions in the present law. All those concessions are to be removed by the proposed new law.
"Independent professionals are at present taxed at flat rates for incomes above the tax free threshold of Rs. 500,000, at 12% for up to Rs. 25 million a year, going up to 16% for anything above 35 million. Under the proposed law, professionals will be taxed at the rates applicable to individuals - tax free for the first Rs. 600,000 and for each succeeding Rs. 600,000 at rates starting at 4% and increasing gradually to 8%, 12%, 16%,20% with the maximum rate of 24% applying to any income above Rs. three million a year. The income tax for professionals had been kept low so as to encourage them to remain in Sri Lanka without moving overseas.
Under Item 10(b)(iii) of Schedule One, rental income will be subject to a 10% withholding tax. This will cause immense hardship to middle class people trying to supplement their income by renting out properties.
"Under the First Schedule of the Bill, the maximum rate of tax applicable to individuals will be 24%. Though the maximum rate applicable to companies is 28%, in certain specified fields such as education, agriculture, tourism, IT based services and exports, the applicable rate will be 14% regardless of the size of the enterprise. This will result in anomalous situations where a large company providing educational services may be taxed at 14% while a teacher who gives private tuition in his home will be taxed at 24%; a major agricultural company will be taxed at 14% while an enterprising youth engaging in market oriented agriculture will be taxed at 24%. The tax on the small and medium sector is also to go up from the present 12%, to 14% under the new law."

GMOA writes to MPs over SAITM controversy
	
The GMOA today wrote to all Parliamentarians asking them to call for a debate on the setting up of SAITM.
It said despite the SAITM issue being resolved, Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne?s interference had aggravated the situation causing financial and other damage to the country.
GMOA Secretary Haritha Aluthge claimed the minister had pumped Rs.3,000 million to the Neville Fernando Teaching Hospital (NFTH) based on a letter of intent.
He claimed the minister had not requested funds from the Treasury but instead had used Health Ministry funds which were meant for the country?s health expenditure, thus causing a huge financial loss to the government and to the country amid several other malpractices which had taken place on this matter.
?We informed Parliament about the dark side of the SAITM and the harm that it posed to the people,? he said and added that the minister's action should be probed by a presidential commission.
Meanwhile, Dr. Aluthge said Dr. Neville Fernando has told the media that 300 new students including 100 foreign students would be enrolled in the next few months despite the government?s call to suspend student enrollment until the SAITM issue was resolved.
He questioned Dr. Fernando?s authority to challenge the country?s governing body and its decisions and enroll a new batch of students. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

Higher investment income propels Amana Takaful June profits
	
Sri Lanka?s Amana Takaful PLC turned a net profit of Rs.34.1 million for the Q2 2017 from a loss of Rs.40.7 million a year earlier, largely due to the substantial increase in investment incomes as the top line growth remained moderate, the interim results showed.?
The group earnings per share was two cents compared to a loss per share of three cents a year earlier. The group share last traded at 80 cents. Amana Takaful, which has operations in both Sri Lanka and Maldives, reported a gross written premium (GWP) of Rs.964.5 million compared to Rs.926.1 million during the same period in 2016.?
This translates to a 4.0 percent year-on-year (YoY) increase pointing to a moderation in growth in new policies. Amana Takaful, the pioneers in Takaful concept of insurance, offers both life and non-life policies in both Sri Lanka and Maldives.?
Its life business, Amana Takaful Life PLC, a fully owned subsidiary of Amana Takaful PLC, was listed in the Colombo Stock Exchange in August 2016.?
During the same period, the holding company raised Rs.210 million in a rights issue to comply with the regulatory capital under the ?risk based capital model? necessitated by the Insurance Board of Sri Lanka.
Meanwhile, for the six months ended in June 30, 2017 (1H17), the group reported a net profit of Rs.69.6 million or four cents a share from a loss of Rs.71 million a year earlier.
Amana Takaful PLC, as a standalone entity reported earnings of Rs.30 million which includes an inter-company dividend of Rs.7.0 million.?
The life entity, Amana Takaful Life, reported a profit of Rs.24.0 million while, ?Am?na Takaful Maldives PLC sustained their GWP at Rs.670 million with a profit out-turn of Rs.44.7 million.?
The company continues to pay surplus and dividends consistently since its listing on the Maldivian Stock Exchange in 2011?, an Amana Takaful press statement said.
The total GWPs registered a growth of only three percent on year to Rs.1.94 billion. Out of this, the non-life premiums were Rs.1.55 billion, up from Rs.1.44 billion a year earlier while the life business premiums were down from Rs.439.2 million to Rs.385.8 million.?
The group is re-balancing its portfolio to reduce the over-reliance on motor business, the group said. During the 2Q17 as well as in the 1H17, the bottom line was largely boosted by the higher investment income.?
Such incomes rose to Rs.125.2 million and Rs.220.3 million for the quarter and the 1H, respectively, registering year-on-year growths of 70 percent and 83 percent YoY.?
During the 1H17, the group paid claims of Rs.701 million, little down from Rs.733.7 million YoY.
The group said the portfolio re-balancing helped largely in managing the flood claims in 2017 as opposed to the same phenomenon in 2016.?
As of 30 June 2017, Amana Holdings held 61.13 percent stake in the company while Amana Bank held 15.26 percent stake.

Highways to be leased out to Chinese Co: PHU
	
The government is attempting to lease out the three expressways to a Chinese Company called ?Shandong?, the Pivithuru Hela Urumaya (PHU) claimed today.
It said a proposal was to be presented to the Cabinet this week to lease out the Southern, Katunayake and Colombo Outer Circular Expressways.
?The expressways are among the latest to fall prey to government moves. The Cabinet paper seeks approval to lease out the highways for US$600 million. The government might say it is not selling but leasing out the expressways. However, if an asset carries a lease of more than 10 years, it is considered a sale,? party leader Udaya Gammanpila told a news conference.
He said the ministers had discussed the matter at the previous cabinet meeting and a senior minister had suggested to create an authority to control the expressways and sell shares of that authority to the Chinese Company.
?This suggestion has been made to overcome any opposition by the people. Regardless of the method adopted, we are completely against this move,? he said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

IR Bill in Parliament on Friday
	
The amended draft of the Inland Revenue Bill would be presented in Parliament on Friday and no tax would be collected from anyone with an annual income less than Rs.1.2 million, Finance Minister Mangala Samaraweera said.
Addressing a media briefing at the Ministry this evening, the Minister said the Bill includes 111 amendments which had been recommended by the Supreme Court.
?In Malaysia, 70 per cent of tax come in the form of Income Tax. The indirect tax percentage is 28 percent. India collects 50 per cent of its tax via Income Tax, Pakistan and Bangladesh governments gross high revenue from Income Tax. The rest is collected by indirect tax received from consumer items that people use in their day-to-day life,? the minister said.
According to the proposal the ministry has decided to lower the direct and indirect tax ratio which remains at 20 to 80 per cent to 40 to 60 per cent in the coming years.
Minister Samaraweera said, the proposed amendment would not effect those receiving an annual income less than Rs.1.2 million.
?The majority including the general labour community should not have any unnecessary fear over the proposal and also the high income generators? who love the country should not make any objections over the amendments,? the minister added. (Chaturanga Pradeep)

Iraq starts offensive to take back Tal Afar from Islamic State
	
?
REUTERS, 20 August, 2017-Iraqi security forces launched on Sunday an offensive to take back the city of Tal Afar, their next objective in the U.S.-backed campaign to defeat Islamic State militants, Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi said. ? ??You either surrender, or die,? Abadi said in a televised speech announcing the offensive, addressing the militants. ??
A longtime stronghold of hardline Sunni insurgents, Tal Afar, 50 miles (80 km) west of Mosul, was cut off from the rest of the Islamic State-held territory in June. ??
The city is surrounded by Iraqi government troops and Shi?ite volunteers in the south, and Kurdish Peshmerga fighters in the north. ??
Hours before Abadi?s announcement, the Iraqi air force dropped leaflets over the city telling the population to take their precautions. ?Prepare yourself, the battle is imminent and the victory is coming, God willing,? they read. ? ?Waves of civilians have fled the city and surrounding villages under cover of darkness over the past weeks, although several thousand are estimated to remain, threatened with death by the militants who have held a tight grip there since 2014. ??

Janashakthi Insurance sees slowdown in new policies during 2Q as premiums moderate
	
The slowdown in vehicle imports and difficult economic conditions faced by policy holder may have impacted Janashakthi Insurance PLC?s June quarter (Q2) as the top line growth moderated while the claims increased, the interim financial accounts filed by the group showed. ??
Janashakthi, the third largest general insurer by premiums, saw its gross written premiums (GWP) rising by just 7.6 percent on year to Rs.3.4 billion for which the group general insurance business contributed 81 percent.?
The general insurance, led by motor insurance, grew by 14 percent year-on-year (YoY) to Rs.2.8 billion.?
Group?s life business reported premiums of Rs.659.3 million for the quarter from Rs.757. 1 million YoY as the life segment is currently undergoing restructuring.
In February, Janashakthi appointed Stuart Chapman as the Chief Executive Officer of its life business.?
Sri Lanka?s life insurance penetration measured by the GWPs is still under 2.0 percent of gross domestic product, one of the lowest in the region, thus the untapped potential remains massive.
The group reported 25 cents a share on a profit of Rs.135.6 million for the three months, down by about 50 percent YoY. ?The share ended at Rs.15.30 at last week?s close, 10 cents or 0.66 percent higher. The net asset value per share was Rs.16.45, up from Rs.14.71.?
The profit was affected by an impairment charge of Rs.133 million on account of the goodwill recognized when Janashakthi acquired the general insurance arm of the AIA Insurance late 2015.?
Janashakthi paid a little over Rs.3.0 billion for the acquisition and was a better fit with Janashakthi as it seeks to consolidate its position in the tough general insurance industry.?
Meanwhile for the six months ended in June (1H17), the group reported earnings of 65 cents a share or Rs.352.6 million compared to Rs.1.16 a share or Rs.630.1 million YoY. The GWPs were Rs.7.2 billion, up 11 percent YoY.
The total incomes were also supported by some good investment income during the period which rose by 27.1 percent on year to Rs.1.19 billion.?
?Investments portfolio grew by Rs.2.0 billion during this six month period with average yields exceeding 10 percent. This was the key driving force behind the 36 percent YoY growth in total other revenue, which came in at Rs.1.474 billion,? the company said in a statement.?
The group paid Rs.3.6 billion as net benefits and claims, compared to Rs.3.2 billion a year earlier which also weighed on the bottom line.?
?Profitability was adversely affected by high claims in both the fire and engineering and the medical segment during the period under review,? the company statement noted.?
As of 30 June 2017, the holding company Janashakthi PLC held 75.92 percent stake in the group while Schaffter family controlled Dunamis Capital PLC held a further 3.17 percent stake.?

One man?s struggle to find willing donors
	
Kidney Transplant Support Foundation?
"This project, able to give the hope of life to many is being neglected by the responsible parties today, laments its founder, grieving for the brainchild withering away before it reached its full potential"
?
A 41-year-old mother of three is looking for an O+ kidney. If you are willing to donate, please contact ... Most of our readers would be familiar with this sort of advertisement. While there are hundreds of Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) patients awaiting transplantation, luckily, our country also have many kind souls who step into help those who are in need, even though they are not related by blood. But the problem lies in connecting the ?needy? with the ?willing?. ??
?Seeing that the cost of the lack of coordination between the two parties was death for the patients awaiting transplantation, Mr. Ajit F. Perera had the inspiration to instigate a ?free of cost? programme that acted as a ?third party?, matching the willing donors and the recipient through a computer, eliminating human bias as an additional benefit. The result was the Kidney Transplant Support Foundation (KTSF), implemented in 2009, of which he is the chairman. This organization won the first Joel D. Koppel award presented by the International Federation of Kidney Foundation in 2010. This international award in itself speaks for the success of the programme. ??
?Under the project, the foundation provided 20 computers with ADSL facilities for the purpose of launching the donor registration procedure in 20 hospitals distributed around the country, utilizing funds provided by a World Bank grant. When a potential donor goes to the nearest hospital and register his details there, all the computers in other 19 hospital would receive this information. ??
But this project, able to give the hope of life to many is being neglected by the responsible parties today, laments its founder, grieving for the brainchild withering away before it reached its full potential. ?
CKD
?CKD is not a new topic to the healthcare sector. It can manifest as a disease in the kidney itself or may develop over a period of time as a result of various factors like Diabetes Mellitus, and Hypertension.
In Sri Lanka, a percentage of these cases occur due to CKDu or Chronic Kidney Disease of Unknown etiology that has manifested in some parts of the country. A small, but a significant percentage of these patients go into Kidney failure also called End Stage Renal Failure (ESRF), needing long term, expensive dialysis or kidney transplantation to continue their lives.
There are over 8000 patients suffering from ESRF, with hundreds adding to the number each year. Many of their lives depend on finding a matching kidney at the right time. ??
?Talking about transplantation, it can be done in two ways, Either via deceased donor transplantation, or live donor transplantation. ??
?Live donor transplantation is where a healthy living person decides to give away one of his kidneys to a person whose both kidneys are not functioning. Either a relative of the family or another person can be the donor in this case. ??
Taking the above into consideration, it is no wonder that organ trade is one of the world?s most lucrative business, despite organ selling being a punishable offence violating international laws, in addition to being highly unethical. Therefore, every time a doctor is performing a transplantation amongst a patient and a live donor who is not a relative, there is the justifiable doubt of the possibility of a monetary transaction amongst the two parties.?
"Each year, about 2500 die of road traffic accidents. If we can utilize at least 5% of these people?s organs to give the gift of life back to someone else, we can save many lives"
?
But the KTSF eliminates this threat because only the volunteers who want to donate their kidneys free of charge and without conditions are recruited, and then the computer goes onto select the best donor through a selection criteria which has been fine tuned by the specialist doctors in the field, explains Perera. ??
Specimen DL with Donor Symbol Yellow
Going against the currents
?According to Perera, this programme, implemented in 2009, was handed over to the government for continuation in 2011. Despite the numerous success stories of patients who received matching donors through it before the handover, the foundation is still on the rocks, more than six years later. What is the reason that this programme which can apparently benefit many, is not functioning properly? He states that this is due to the lack of support from some medical officers involved in kidney transplantation process. The tardiness in the officials of the Ministry of Health doesn?t help either, he states. ??
?So far it has been an upstream battle for him. He has been writing to the relevant official since 2012 , trying to get the programme back on the ground with no visible effect. ??
Among the many that added to the obstacles in his journey, there were some people with similar visions who willingly accompanied him in this difficult road. Dr. A.M.L Beligaswaththa, former Director General of Health Services is one such person. In an interview conducted with our sister paper daily Lankadeepa, Dr. Beligaswaththta states that the reason for the failure of this project is the attitude of certain people in the health sector. ?If this project by Mr. Ajit Perera, which functioned as a charity organization had proper government patronage, it could have been the best programme helping the Sri Lankan citizens awaiting kidney transplantation?, he comments. ??

"While the people who are ?brain dead?, meaning that their hearts keep functioning even though their brains are irreversibly damaged are the preferred donors, since the blood supply to the kidney remains uninterrupted, the kidneys of people who died because their hearts stopped functioning also can be utilized in transplantation"

A man with a vision
Ajit Perera, coming from a family of a long line of philanthropists is no stranger to giving to the people of the country, expecting no benefits in return. His father was late Wilmot A. Perera, the founder of Sripali Vidyalaya in Horana. His great grandfather was Charles Henry De Soysa (C.H.De Soysa) who was one of the greatest Philantropist in recent times, donating 4 hospitals and the Medical Research Institute, the Prince & Princess of Wales Colleges etc. His great grandmother Mrs. Jeremias Dias was the founder and benefactor of Visakha Vidyalaya. He himself has donated the land and building which now form the Sri Palee Campus. ??
?His efforts in this specific field of interest are not limited to KTSF. Since the number of volunteers who are willing to give away a kidney while alive is limited, he wanted to reach beyond live donors to focus on cadaveric organ donations. While the people who are ?brain dead?, meaning that their hearts keep functioning even though their brains are irreversibly damaged are the preferred donors, since the blood supply to the kidney remains uninterrupted, the kidneys of people who died because their hearts stopped functioning also can be utilized in transplantation, if harvested immediately, according to Perera. ?Each year, about 2500 die of road traffic accidents. If we can utilize at least 5% of these people?s organs to give the gift of life back to someone else, we can save many lives?, he declares. ??
"If this project by Mr. Ajit Perera, which functioned as a charity organization had proper government patronage, it could have been the best programme helping the Sri Lankan citizens awaiting kidney transplantation"
?Willingness to donate? expressed in the Driving License
?That is why he had been trying to persuade the authorities to include a symbol indicating that a person is willing to be an organ donor in their driving license, for more than eight years. He has seen some positive light in this project because as Perera says, a person who is applying for a driving license can now express his willingness to become an organ donor through a special symbol included in the license itself. He says that over 12000 new driving licenses are carrying this symbol. ??
Perera plans to develop this concept further so that the Police, when they take a victim of an accident or a dead body to the hospital, they have to inform the hospital authorities that the person has given his consent to become an organ donor in case of his death. So unfortunately if the inevitable happens, the doctors will be prepared and his organs will give life to someone else, making some good out of a bad situation. This would be a small consolation for the family of the deceased as well, since a small part of their loved one is still living, blowing life to another human being. He is hopeful that the authorities in the healthcare sector would share his vision to make it a reality, benefitting thousands of Sri Lankan citizens tomorrow. ??

Thousands protest in Hong Kong over jailing of democracy activists
	
?
REUTERS, 20th AUGUST, 2017-Thousands of people took to the streets of Hong Kong on Sunday to protest against the jailing of three young democracy activists, with many questioning the independence of the Chinese-ruled city?s judiciary.
On Thursday, Joshua Wong, 20, Nathan Law, 24 and Alex Chow, 27, were jailed for six to eight months for unlawful assembly, dealing a blow to the youth-led push for universal suffrage and prompting accusations of political interference.
Thousands of people marched in sweltering temperatures above 30 degrees Celsius (86?F) to the Court of Final Appeal, carrying placards and banners denouncing the jailing of the activists.
Former student leader Lester Shum, who helped organize Sunday?s rally, said the number of protesters was the highest since pro-democracy protests in 2014 that paralyzed parts of the financial hub for 79 days.
?This shows that the Hong Kong government, the Chinese Communist regime and the Department of Justice?s conspiracy to deter Hong Kong people from continuing to participate in politics and to protest using harsh laws and punishments has completely failed,? Shum said. Protesters brandished a large banner saying: ?It?s not a crime to fight against totalitarianism.? They shouted: ?Release all political prisoners. Civil disobedience. We have no fear. We have no regrets.?

Two women's fight over ownership of dogs ends in court
	
The Anuradhapura Police had taken two dogs into their care after two women, one who initially owned the dogs and the other who acted as the caretaker of the dogs got into a fight with regards to dogs' ownership.
A woman who was originally from Colombo and currently living in Anuradhapura, loved dogs, whom she found homes for. A few months ago she had given two of these dogs to be cared by another woman in 'Vijeyapura'. Recently, she had asked for the dogs back. However, the woman whom she gave the dogs over to look after claimed that she had spent Rs. 30,000 on the two dogs and refused to return them to their earlier owner. This had ended in the two women brawling over the ownership of the dogs, which was brought to an end by the police, who stepped in to restore law and order.
With the two sides unable to come to a compromise with regards to the ownership of the dogs with the woman from Vijeyapura even producing a veterinary card for the two dogs, the police decided to let the court decide who the dogs should go to.
The case will be heard in the Anuradhapura Magistrate's court.
Acting hq. Chief Inspector Prabath Gallage said that this was not the first time the woman who was given dogs to look after these dogs had lodged complaints against other people.(Upul Herath)
