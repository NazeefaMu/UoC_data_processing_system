Modi may visit SL in March
	
	NEW DELHI: With a new government taking office in Sri Lanka, Prime Minister Narendra Modi may travel to Colombo in March. If he does go, it will be the first state visit by an Indian PM since Rajiv Gandhi's trip in 1987.
	Speaking to journalists after his first visit in his new capacity, Sri Lanka's new foreign minister Mangala Samaraweera said, "The new government wanted to demonstrate importance of restoring friendly ties with our neighbour." Samaraweera said external affairs minister Sushma Swaraj would travel to Sri Lanka for the joint commission meeting in February. This would be followed by the first visit to India by new Sri Lankan President Maithripala Sirisena.
	Describing the regime change in Sri Lanka as its "own version of the Arab Spring", Samaraweera said the transition was not as easy as it might appear. The images of Mahinda Rajapaksa waving goodbye to his staff at his official residence was greeted with relief that the departing strongman had accepted the people's verdict.
	Samaraweera said Rajapaksa was attempting to conduct a "coup" by imposing an emergency. "But our armed forces stood by us," he said adding a full inquiry would be conducted into the events of that night.
	The foreign minister promised to revisit the mammoth port city projects by China. This assurance was given by new Prime Minister Ranil Wickremasinghe too.
	He also promised a domestic investigation and inquiry into alleged human rights violations in the last months of the war against the LTTE in 2009. The Rajapaksa government had several run-ins with the UN Human Rights Council on this issue. Samaraweera said their government was leaning towards having a domestic mechanism with international support, something that India would be happy to endorse.
	The Sirisena government, the foreign minister said, intended to abolish the executive presidency, by essentially repealing the 18th amendment. On the 13th amendment though he was a lot more careful. He said they would return land to Tamils as well take a slew of other steps, which he said would not need the 13th amendment.
	All the parties in the coalition would have a forum under the leadership of Chandrika Kumaratunga, tentatively called the National Executive Council. (Times of India)

13A subjected to Unitary Character
	
	Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, in his first parliamentary address after assuming office in the new administration headed by President Maithripala Sirisena -- said the Government would preserve the unitary character of the Constitution when introducing constitutional reforms.
	He outlined the plan for the execution of the 100-day programme and said the Government would introduce the 19th Amendment to the Constitution for the establishment of independent commissions which were rendered worthless under the 18th Amendment.
	The Prime Minister said fresh constitutional reforms would be enacted to transfer the executive powers to the Legislature and the Cabinet during this period.
	"We will introduce these reforms while preserving the unitary character of the Constitution. The 13th Amendment to the Constitution will be implemented subject to that principle," he said.
	He said the stage had been set for a novel political culture and his government intended to engage in consensus politics rather than adopting a confrontational approach in achieving the targets set out in the 100-day programme in the greater interest of the country.
	The Prime Minister said the country was engulfed in political and economic issues and grappling with challenges on the international front and added that the government would overcome all these challenges. He said the Government would enact the National Audit Bill, Right to Information Bill and the legislation for the implementation of the National Medicinal Drugs Policy.
	"We now have a new political culture in which the main political parties have cast aside their policies and ideological differences to achieve common goals. This is a novel experience for the entire region. We will tread this path in consultation with all stakeholders," he said. (Kelum Bandara and Yohan Perera)

Desperate Lankans to consult expert on Malinga recovery
	
	Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) Executive Committee has approved a suggestion by Chief National Selector Sanath Jayasuriya to get an opinion on Lasith Malinga from world renowned Australian doctor of Sri Lankan origin Professor Siri Kannangara.
	Key bowler Malinga who underwent an ankle surgery in September last year was expected to complete his recuperation within 16 weeks and be available for the final two matches of the current seven-match ODI series against New Zealand.
	However, Jayasuriya said that Malingas recovery has been slower than expected and he had to be ruled out of the series against New Zealand.
	Yesterday, Jayasuriya told the stunned SLC ex-co member that the star bowlers recovery in time for the World Cup starting on February 14 now looked very slim.
	It is very unlikely that he would be able to play in the World Cup Jayasuriya said.
	Malinga was operated on by famous Australian surgeon Dr. David Young. Jayasuriya told  that he was keen to have the opinion of Professor Kannangara too after learning about the Sydney based doctors reputation, and claimed Sri Lanka was getting desperate as they were fast running out of options.
	I was told that he is an ankle specialist. So, lets hope the good doctor would be able to pull off some miracle, said Jayasuriya.
	Kannangara is Professor of Medicine at the University of Sydney and has functioned as a Physician and Consultant to the Australian Olympic teams at the Barcelona, Atlanta and Sydney Games, and at World Cup events for football, cricket, net ball and hockey. Prof. Kannangara is also the Director of the New South Wales Institute of Sports Medicine and he served in the FIFA Medical Committee from 1999 to 2006.
	Interestingly, before undergoing surgery, Malinga himself suggested that Sri Lanka should groom a successor for him at the World Cup.
	I will do everything I can to be back for the World Cup, but I think it would be good for us to give a young bowler a few opportunities in the meantime, so that we can at least have someone prepared, Malinga had told media in September.
	Sri Lankas fiercest weapon for more than a decade, Malinga will be sorely missed by Sri Lanka on the fast and bouncy tracks in Australia and New Zealand, if he is unable to make it.
	Meanwhile, young paceman Dushmantha Chameera has been dispatched to New Zealand to fill Malingas void.
	Sources told Daily Mirror that captain Angelo Mathews and other senior players had requested national selectors to send experienced paceman Dilhara Fernando as the replacement, but selectors had turned down the request.

Dinesh asks Ravi to apologise to country
	
	Mahajana Eksath Peramuna (MEP) leader Dinesh Gunawardane said yesterday Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake should apologise to the country for making a false statement about a bank account maintained by former Defence Secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa
	Mr. Gunawardane told Parliament that the media had been manipulated under the new Government to spread falsehoods against the leaders of the previous Government.
	He said there was a sinister media campaign about a coup hatched at Temple Trees on the day after elections.
	"It is total fiction. I know the Prime Minister is aware of what happened. Therefore, I am asking the Government not to load people with false news. It does not help the good governance that you proposed," Mr. Gunawardene said.
	Referring to the news item about a floating armoury in the sea off Galle, he said it was part of maritime security arrangements to protect the transnational ships and other naval activities to prevent sea piracy.
	"This security arrangement has been recognised by the United Nation. Yet, the Government twists news stories. They are playing with the media. I kindly request you to allow the media to engage in impartial and accurate reporting rather than loading them with falsehoods," he said.
	Mr. Gunawardene said nobody could forget the fact that it was former President Mahinda Rajapaksa who defeated separatist terrorism in this country.
	"We all know Defence Secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa played a pivotal role in this effort. Today, there are accusations against him about running a bank account with a balance of eight billion rupees. This news has been vehemently denied even by the new Defence Secretary," he said.(Kelum Bandara and Yohan Perera)

Govt. to engage with UNHRC
	
	Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said yesterday that Sri Lanka was not a party to the Rome Statute and therefore all matters should be determined by domestic jurisdiction but that the new Government would engage with the UN Human Rights Council and the concerned members in a positive manner so that an understanding could be reached on outstanding issues on human rights.
	The Prime Minister expressed these views at a conference of Asias Attorneys General held at the BMICH to mark the 130th anniversary of the Sri Lanka Attorney Generals Department.
	President Mathripala Sirisena was the Chief Guest while Attorney General Y.J.W. Vijayatilake presided over the inaugural session which was attended by Justice Minister Wijedasa Rajapakshe, Senior Supreme Court Judge K. Sripavan and Solicitor General Bimba Tillekeratne.
	The following is the statement made by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe:
	I know the pressure under which the Attorney Generals Department functions. But somehow the rule of law is upheld. It has not been tampered with completely. Let the people of Sri Lanka get the democratic systems back. We have already drafted the 19th Amendment to for the restoration of the Independent Commissions and the power of the judiciary. We are in the process of bringing to Parliament the Witness Protection Bill, the Right to Information Bill and the National Audit Bill. The Minister of Justice is entrusted with this task. It is just the beginning of good governance, the Parliamentary Committees, the establishment of the Public Finance Committee and the enforcing of parliamentary control over the executive.
	The basic concept of the rule of law is damaged and the rule of law was set aside during the war. Even after the war, it continued. We must ensure the principle of the rule of law. When terrorism is ended, the rule of law must be restored. The law cant be silent even after the war.
	The Army Commander who defeated the LTTE was brought to Court overnight as a traitor. Then the Chief Justice was removed from her post. There are many other instances of people being victimised.
	Somehow the rule of law was upheld. Sri Lankans want the democratic systems back. The President and the Government will implement the 19th Amendment and restore the independent commissions.
	It is very important to ensure that Sri Lanka upholds the rule of law in Asia. We will also ensure the sectional protocol of the ICC. People believe that the rule of law has been tampered with. The rule of law also is in danger of disappearing. We have to ensure that the rule of law which is the oldest legal system has to be restored. the Prime Minister said. (S.S.

Sri Lankan successfully completes IATA Environmental Assessment
	
	Taking forward t he green legacy of the national carrier, SriLankan has successfully completed the International Air Transport Associations Environment Assessment (IEnvA) Program Stage 01 Assessment.Sri Lankan has completed the first of two stages of assessments alongside some other prominent international carriers including, Icelandair and Qatar Airways. South African Airways and Finnair have also recently completed the second and final assessments stage of the IEnvAProgram.
Sri Lankan Air lines Head of Human Resources and the Convenor of the Green Team, Pradeepa Kekulawala said, As the national carrier of Sri Lanka, that has been promoting the countys natural beauty worldwide, we have been fully aware of our responsibility towards environment; this has driven us to involve ourselves in sustainable practices thereby contributing to conservation. The Green Team of SriLankan Airlines has been i mplementing many projects on carbon mitigation and waste management. We are proud that SriLankan Airlines has completed the IEnvA stage 1 Assessment, which goes to show our dedication towards environment as an airline, and the passengers who fly with us can take pride in the fact that they become contributors to conservation through their choice of airline.
These airlines are among the pioneers in this critical new program. IATAs audits and assessment schemes are impartial, independent evaluations designed to improve industry performance against global benchmarks. The IATA Operational Safety Audit has done much to help improve airline safety and we expect that the IEnvA will do likewise for environmental standards said Tony Tyler, IATAs Director-General and CEO.
IEnvA has been developed in conjunction with airlines so that it addresses industry needs and specific concerns. IEnvA assesses environmental performance against sustainability standards across a broad range of disciplines, including (but not limited to) the management of air quality and emissions, noise, fuel consumption and operational efficiency, recycling, energy efficiency, sustainable procurement, and biofuel utilization. Further this evaluation system is designed to independently assess and improve the environmental management of an airline and as a voluntary programme IEnvA helps airlines to simplify regulatory compliance, demonstrate good governance and achieve financial savings from the better use of resources.
SriLankan Airlines, Environmental Compliance and Planning Manager, Dhanushka de Silva said, This is a proud moment for SriLankan Airlines when the Airlines Environment Strategic and Compliance unit achieves a great milestone in terms of environmental standards and regulatory compliances. This signifies our team effort and commitment to organise and structure our operational processes according to the International environmental standards.
IEnvA implementation follows a phased approach due t o t he complexity and global presence of airlines. This involves a detailed assessment of flight operations, corporate and management activities.The two implementation phases are:Stage 01 ensures an airline has developed t he foundation and framework for its environmental management system. Stage 1 also certifies an airline has identified and complied with its environmental legal requirements.Stage 02 is the highest level of IEnvA achievement, ensures that an airline has implemented all of the IEnvA Program Standards, identified and mitigated its significant environmental impacts and has set performance targets. Stage 2 also certifies that an airline has developed processes for monitoring and reviewing its performance against its targets and objectives, thus driving environmental efficiency.
SriLankans Green Vision is focussed on becoming South Asias pioneering Planet-Friendly Airline and to achieve sustainable business development. The Airline continues to take on many sustainable projects focussing on reducing carbon footprint and conserving nature with the help of passionate volunteers and partnerships.
