A farewell birthday at public expense
	
A Chief purohita of a provincial body due to be dissolved shortly had celebrated his birthday on a grand scale at his office recently. After cutting the birthday cake, the provincial politico had fed pieces of cake to the members of his staff. He had even sent pieces of the birthday cake to the employees who could not attend the party.

The politico had held this birthday party at public expense as this could be the last birthday that he would be able to celebrate in office, informed sources said.

A modern prison  that meets world standards
	
Prison walls have a double function; to lock people in and the public out  Manfred Nowak
- former UN Special Rapporteur on Torture.

We have been taught that life inside prison is hell on earth. This saying from the past was proven wrong with the declaring open of the countrys first prison at
Angunukolapelessa, Hambantota yesterday. The facility has been built to meet present international standards
The congestion of inmates in the prison and the severe conditions in archaic prisons across the country were facts that troubled prison authorities for many years. But the general opinion of the public is that criminals should treated as criminals and be imprisoned in places where there are the least facilities and zero comforts. 

The luxury prison at Angunukolapelessa, Hambantota

In 2014 February the then Speaker of the House Chamal Rajapaksa laid the foundation stone for a luxury prison facility in Angunukolapelessa, Hambantota. However the intention behind building such a star class prison at that time wasnt very clear. The building raised a lot of suspicion due to its opulent features and the mysteriousness surrounding it, but construction was completed in the middle of this year sans interruptions. 
The facility referred to by the public as the Super Prison, due to its luxury features, made newspaper headlines. The facility was built at an estimated cost of Rupees 4.5 billion on a 65-acre land. The construction of the prison complex was undertaken by a local company, Sanken Constructions Private Limited, using local manpower. 
The prison was to be declared open on March 16 with President Maithripala Sirisena in attendance, but the event was postponed because the President had declined to accept an invitation.

For the first time in the history of Sri Lanka prisons, bio-gas energy has been introduced. The prison will have an underground bio-gas plant
Following many efforts and discussions the prison complex was declared open by Prison Reforms Minister D.M.Swaminathan with the participation of officials of the Department of Prisons, on October yesterday. Prisons Reforms Ministry Spokesman Dumidu Bandara said that inmates from Tangalle, Kalutara and Colombo would be transferred to the newly build facility.

The visited the complex before the construction work concluded and learned that the Tangalle Prison was on the verge of collapsing, risking the lives of inmates. This is what made the authorities expedite the construction process of the new prison.
Super features 
The entire prison complex can accommodate over 1,500 inmates, both men and women. The facility also has separate sections for male and female inmates who are minors.
When building the Angunukolapelessa Prison great attention has been given to ensure that the inmates remain healthy. To achieve this the authorities have built a three-storeyed indoor sport complex in addition to outdoor volleyball and netball courts.
The facility also includes a 7-lap swimming pool which boasts of the latest technology. This facility built for aquatic sport will also have changing rooms and a shower area.
Near the entrance to the prison premises, which is on the left, the authorities have built a large ground which sports a 4,000 metre track. There are also four pavilions, large enough to host a district sporting event.

However prison officials told the Daily Mirror that these facilities have been built for the use of the officials and to conduct sports activities of schoolchildren. However, there are concerns because this part of the prison is outside the cells, and will be used by inmates who have had a brush with the law. The prison will also have 140 officers quarters. Each quarters can accommodate 6 families and also has many single billets.
The prison is also equipped with a modern hospital which provides inmates with standard medical facilities, up to treatment at OPD level.
For the first time in the history of Sri Lanka prisons, bio-gas energy has been introduced. The prison will have an underground bio-gas plant.
When the prison was constructed attention had also been given to have a place to entertain visitors.

However the public have their suspicions whether the facility will be misused by high-profile politicians who do wrong. This is because of the comforts available at this facility
The facility has a cafeteria for visitors which can cater to about100 people. There are also several rest rooms where guests can be accommodated. Meanwhile, the authorities have also built a couple of lecture halls within the prison. The entire prison has been provided with ample security using high end CCTV cameras. There will be 24-hour monitoring done from watchtowers, using modern devices.
A special fire-control unit will be deployed around the prison premises and a separate fire truck and ambulance service complete this line-up.
According to prison authorities special security is provided at the prisoners cells. The corridors are monitored by CCTV cameras apart from the prison officers being on duty.
It was learned that the facility is a one of a kind prison in South Asia, given its superior facilities.
The construction of the new prison has been hailed by several parties. However the public have their suspicions whether the facility will be misused by high-profile politicians who do wrong. This is because of the comforts available at this facility.
Prison authorities confirmed that the Tangalle Prison would be discontinued with and that some inmates of the Welikada Prison would also be transferred to the facility at Agunukolapelessa.

Almost home:   Why we arent quite there
	
The third and last in a series of articles delving into our local theatre

Because of certain fortuitous and unfortunate circumstances, those who want to engage in our local theatre are hindered from pursuing it once school is over. This is true in particular for regions and districts and provinces which privilege hard subjects over softer ones, i.e. science and commerce over the arts. Its significant to note, for instance, that in Colombo, Kandy, and Galle the ratios of commerce and science students to arts students have always been above 2, while those ratios in Moneragala (which has consistently recorded the highest Gini coefficient at 0.53) has always been below 0.6. Lets face it: numbers dont lie, even if they indicate a relationship between social status and choice of University subjects which we are at times told doesnt exist. In Colombo especially, this relationship is profound, potent, unassailable.
The English theatre is more fortunate because its members, or coterie as I like to identify them, are socially insured against poverty when they opt for the stage. Especially when it comes to the themes they opt for  musical comedies, satires and farces, socially relevant dramas  they always have veritable reserves of actors, producers, and writers who pursue other careers while pursuing the stage. No one is a full time producer in this country, except those whove been active for more than 20 or 30 years (think of Jith Pieris and Jerome de Silva). But they are insured against an unstable industry because that coterie which patronises them are always there, particularly if its a musical comedy or light-hearted farce. The problems of the Sinhala theatre are more complex, more intriguing. Heres an attempt at a sketch.


An average production would normally cost anywhere between Rs. 500,000 to 1.5 million, and thats just for one or two shows. Numbers are inescapable and so are big budgets, particularly in these hard, harsh times, and they necessitate sponsors

Its fashionable now and then to indict an art form as practised by a certain milieu, in formerly colonial societies, as being elitist. The conventional discourse here, then, is that the English theatre, as practised by the Wendites, is cut off from the people, while the Sinhala theatre panders to the people. If this were indeed true, its inscrutable that the latter must be ailed with a dearth of dedicated, energetic schoolboys and schoolgirls who wish to pursue it after they leave school, like their counterparts in the English theatre. Obviously its not a problem of numbers, but rather a problem of a dichotomy between numerical strength and lack of unity. The typical English Drama Society of a typical school, particularly in the Big Cities, is different from its Sinhala counterpart because there are fewer people in the former. Consequently, theres a broader sense of unity, of togetherness, which big numbers cant replicate.
More often than not theres a symbiotic relationship between certain Clubs and Societies that are in turn linked to the relative monetary power of the English theatre. These Societies are entrenched, financially that is, and their members are more often than not to be found in various other Clubs which are as financially sound. All that goes back to the English Drama Societies, which are partly funded, or even subsidised and sponsored, by those other Clubs, which in turn are housed by members and participants who come from backgrounds that are amenable to the theatre. Its a circle that never stops going round and round, in one sense, and it at once explains the potency of the English theatre, at school and elsewhere, and why school Drama Societies are more able to stage their productions for the public if those productions happen to be English. (One can think of Around the World in Eighty Days, Dracula, and Kensukes Kingdom, all of which were produced through these Societies.)
Lets look at the numbers again. An average production would normally cost anywhere between Rs. 500,000 to 1.5 million, and thats just for one or two shows. Numbers are inescapable and so are big budgets, particularly in these hard, harsh times, and they necessitate sponsors. Unfortunately even institutions which patronise and sponsor the arts, and concerts and shows and so on, think twice about financing Sinhala productions, be it a drama or even a felicitation ceremony, because they fear they wont get a proper audience. Thats the kind of fear they think they can evade through English productions; this is true of musical comedies but true also of any school production that involves huge casts, marketable plots, and the Lionel Wendt. I find the latter alluring too, so that may explain why sponsors are easier to get for them. (And as if to add insult to injury the sponsors admit this point candidly; just the other day a boy told me that he had approached one of them for an exhibition of the evolution of the Sinhala theatre and had been bluntly informed that they prefer to sponsor events and exhibitions organised for English-speaking audiences).
These reasons in themselves are not, of course, enough to explain why our schoolchildren leave our theatre rather quickly. Theres another reason: in the Big Cities, most if not many of those who join Drama Societies (Sinhala) tend to come from streams and to study subjects which are not immediately connected with the theatre. Its pertinent to note that we are duplicitous when it comes to the arts: we want to adorn our
houses with paintings and music but dont want our children to be painters and musicians. Similarly, when we opt for harder subjects  Science, Maths, Commerce  and when we join a Society, what we do after school, or whether we continue with the activities these Societies engaged in, depends on what those subjects by default ordain as our careers. The lucky ones, even if they do these hard subjects, resolve and manage to be freelance artists and writers. But they are rare.
And because they study hard subjects, how they get into these Societies is as arbitrary as how they get out of them: more often than not, all it takes for them to be scriptwriters and actors (the latter more than the former) is a chance encounter with an official or a teacher who discerns his or her penchant for the arts (because the arts, unlike science and commerce, is rather instinctive; you dont study it, you GET it) and then takes him or her in. Such chance encounters arent as rare as youd think they are, and they explain how the members of Drama Societies get in (whatever the language), but because of how condescended the Sinhala theatre is, its not considered a safe, veritable, worthwhile option even as a hobby once school is done with. Contrast that with how members of the English Societies remain and come back, frequently.

Its a circle that never stops going round and round, in one sense, and it at once explains the potency of the English theatre, at school and elsewhere, and why school Drama Societies are more able to stage their productions for the public if those productions happen to be English

We are living in a world of freelancers and one hit wonders. Our movies, which were once housed by Thespians, have now partially abandoned the theatre and, like the advertising industry, begun to take in models, some of whom have no real idea about the intricacies of acting. This is not to imply that our models are unintelligent. They are not. But for the most they come with a background in photography (because the model was built to be photographed, if not filmed for a matter of seconds or minutes); the level of commitment needed for a 30-second commercial is different to the level required for a 90-minute film. Sometimes these models make the transition sleekly (think of Rithika Kodithuwakku), but in these cases they understand the medium.
What we lack isnt just a network of practitioners and performers, but something more: a mechanism to encourage more practitioners and performers from our schools, particularly in the Big Cities. This is important because in those Big Cities the rift between those who go for hard subjects and those who opt for softer subjects has never been wider before. Such a rift can only negatively impact those who wish to indulge in a form of theatre that is at once quantitatively superior and frequently condescended. The Sinhala theatre is suffering at present, not for want of good performers and writers, but because of that accursed tendency of our schoolboys and schoolgirls to drop out once theyre done with their studies, owing to reasons Ive sketched above. And this affects drama more than any other medium, since the theatre is one of the most expensive art forms. Debaters, novelists, and poets, in whatever language, can follow what they do even if they dont pursue it as their careers (a debater can be a doctor, an engineer, or a scientist, for instance), while a dramatist has to expend effort on his or her work, and turn it at least into a part-time commitment.
What these reflections bring me to is a simple, potent, unassailable fact: we are haphazard, random, chaotic, and uncommitted when it comes to our local theatre. Particularly in our schools. Its fatally easy and convenient to pinpoint certain facts and figures as the reasons for this malaise, but the truth, as always, is more diverse and multifaceted than that. In the end its all to do with that crude, inscrutable mixture of reverence and condescension with which we treat our own art forms.
Perhaps the ultimate irony is that we are more willing to exhibit Pirandello and Beckett and Shaw in English than in Sinhala, despite the many creative ways in which these playwrights and their work have been adapted and reworked by our producers and actors. We prefer spectacle to subtlety, and in the English theatre, within or outside our schools, we are explicit about our excitement. And lets face it: numbers may not lie, and big numbers may be alluring, but the more people there are on a boat, the more likely it is that they will bicker, fight amongst themselves, and fall into the water. In a manner of speaking, no matter how inapt that metaphor may be, this is whats happening to our local theatre. Inside and outside our schools.

Anika flees country due to threats
	
Additional Solicitor General Yasantha Kodagoda today informed the PCoI that Anika Wijesuriya, who previously testified before the Commission with regard to leasing out of a Penthouse by Arjun Aloysius in which former Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayakes family resided, had fled the country due to numerous threats levelled against her.
ASG Kodagoda said that he earlier, informed the Commission that the Attorney Generals team had predicted the threat to her life and named her as a witness under the Witness Protection Act.
Additional Solicitor General Yasantha Kodagoda revealed this while he was informing the Commission about a complaint received by them from the elder brother of Anika Wijesooriya as he was threatened by one Shanil Neththikumara recently.
"He owns casinos and Ravi Karunanayake is his uncle. He had threatened Wijith Wijesuriya the brother of Anika. Anika has now fled the country and an investigation into this must be carried out as it is an offence under the Penal Code and the Witness Protection Act" he said.
Neththikumara is a person who seems to be acting on behalf of the person whose name was implicated during Anikas evidence, ASG Kodagoda said. (Shehan Chamika Silva)

Bond Commissions ongoing proceedings come to an end
	
The Presidential Commission of Inquiry (PCoI) concluded its recording of Evidence today stating that it had forwarded a list of questions to the Prime Minister and if necessary would request him to attend a hearing to seek further clarifications.
However, the Commission informed the Attorney Generals team that in the event new evidence surfaces they would commence proceedings with a one-day notice.
Chairman of the Commission Justice K.T. Chitrasiri made a statement bring the proceedings of the Commission to a conclusion. The full statement follows:
The recording of evidence before this Commission of Inquiry commenced on 21st February 2017. All hearings have been held in public. There have been 120 days on which hearings were held. 63 witnesses have given evidence. The evidence of some witnesses spanned several days. Over 450 documents have been produced in evidence, with several of these documents consisting of a large number of pages.
In the event that, after today, any new material is identified and the Commissioners are of the view that, such new material must be placed before this Commission of Inquiry as formal evidence, a further hearing will be held.
Subject to that, the Commission of Inquiry has now completed the hearing of evidence, except for recording the evidence of the Prime Minister, if it is required.
In that regard, we consider it relevant to state that, the Commission of Inquiry has previously forwarded a list of questions, in the nature of interrogatories, to the Prime Minister and has requested the Prime Minister to provide his answers, by way of an affidavit. If required, a list of further questions will be forwarded to the Prime Minister. Upon receipt of the affidavit, the Commission of Inquiry will peruse its contents and, if necessary, request the Prime Minister to attend a hearing of the Commission of Inquiry to give evidence or request the Prime Minister to provide further clarification, as this Commission of Inquiry considers necessary.
If any further hearing is to be held, a notice to such effect will be displayed at the Office of the Commission of Inquiry before the day of any such hearing.
The Commissioners now have, before us, the task of carefully studying and analyzing all the oral and documentary evidence that has been presented and preparing our Report to be submitted to the President. This will be a complex, arduous and time consuming exercise. Therefore, we will be compelled to request His Excellency to extend the warrant issued to the Commission of Inquiry which, at present, is due to end on 27th October 2017.
In the meantime, counsel who have appeared before the Commission of Inquiry are given the opportunity to tender their written submissions, if any, on or before 25th October 2017. In the event the warrant issued to the Commission of Inquiry is extended before that date, any written submissions may be tendered within a further week from 25th October 2017.
The Commissioners wish to thank the team of officers of the Attorney Generals Department, who assisted the Commission of Inquiry. They have worked long hours and have demonstrated sustained dedication to their task of presenting evidence, which had to be gathered from a very large amount of documents and after consultations with many persons. The Commissioners deeply appreciate their efforts and thank these officers.
The Commissioners wish to thank learned counsel who appeared before the Commission of Inquiry on behalf of persons who wished to be represented under and in terms of section 16 of the Commissions of Inquiry Act. The Commissioners appreciate the cooperation given by these counsel to the Commission of Inquiry in completing the time consuming and often difficult task of conducting these proceedings.
The Commissioners wish to thank the officers of the Criminal Investigation Department who carried out investigations and recorded the statements of witnesses and other persons. They have made a significant and valuable contribution to the efforts of the Commission of Inquiry.
Finally, the Commissioners wish to place on record our gratitude to Mr. S. Udugamasuriya, Attorney-at-Law, who has functioned as the Secretary of this Commission of Inquiry and to all the members of the Staff of this Commission of Inquiry for their cooperation and hard work, which has enabled this Commission of Inquiry to function.

			PTL net inflows happened mainly through transactions with Govt. entities 
			Out of the total net inflow (Rs. 11 billion) of Perpetual Treasuries Ltd during 2015 -2016 in bond disposals, Rs. 8.5 billion came through from the transactions with Government institutions.
			During todays Proceedings, Deputy Solicitor General Milinda Gunatilleke led another witness, Suresh Sedara, who is an Assistant Director of CBSL, through a document prepared by the witness, which is relating to the calculation made by him regarding PTLs net inflow during the time period of February 2015 to March 2016.
			This computation was based on the documents provided by PTL itself to the Commission.
			There were seven ISINs (International Securities Identification Number) that had been investigated relating to PTLs disposal of bonds.
			DSG Gunatilleke submitting relevant documents moved that out of the PTLs total inflows from the counter parties in relation to these bonds, PTL gained net inflows largely through Government institutions. (Shehan Chamika Silva)

Budget 2018 should continue fiscal consolidation: IMF
	
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) yesterday said Sri Lankas upcoming 2018 budget should continue fiscal consolidation, supported by the recently passed Inland Revenue Act.
The IMF in a press communiqu acknowledged that the Sri Lankan authorities have been improving the countrys fiscal position and strengthened its international reserves.
But the multilateral lender highlighted that more needs to be done in the area of state-owned enterprises (SOEs).
Upholding the reform momentum will be important for addressing fiscal and external imbalances and meeting the governments ambitious social and development objectives.
Renewed effort toward bolstering competitiveness, improving social protection programmes and boosting private sector development will be important for making growth more robust and inclusive, the communiqu noted.
The IMF also reiterated its earlier position that the countrys Central Bank should remain vigilant to the pressures on inflation and credit growth, while continuing to enhance exchange rate flexibility.
The IMF team has reached a staff-level agreement with the Sri Lankan authorities on the third review on the economic reform programme supported by a three-year Extended Fund Facility (EFF) arrangement, subject to the completion of a prior action by the authorities and the approval of the IMF Executive Board.
The Board is expected to consider Sri Lankas request for completion of the third review in December 2017, by which time the 2018 budgetconsistent with the EFF-supported programmeis expected to be submitted to parliament as a prior action, the IMF communiqu said.

Bus drivers ignoring time schedules to face penalties: RPTA
	
Stern action would be taken against bus drivers who fail to reach their destination by the scheduled time, Western Province Road Passenger Transport Authority (RPTA) General Manager Jagath Perera said today.
Speaking to the Daily Mirror he said that several complaints had been received by the RPTA relating to delays.We receive many complaints about bus drivers stopping and waiting for long periods in order to fill their buses with commuters, he said. Every route has a starting and ending time and drivers are required to reach their destination at the stipulated time in order that the bus service runs smoothly, Mr. Perera said.
Accordingly, the RPTA had decided to monitor the drivers' performance and punish those who fail to reach their destination on time. They would not be allowed to take their ensuing turns if this happens and will only be assigned one once other drivers finish theirs as a punishment.
Time keepers had been advised to monitor the time of taking off and arrival closely. Several road investigative officers would also be deployed along the route to ensure conformity, he said.
These new regulations would be applicable to both SLTB and private bus drivers who operate under a combined timetable, he said.
Commuters can lodge complaints via the Authoritys hotlines 0115 559595, 0112871353 and 0112871354. These regulations are already in operation, he said. (Chaturanga Pradeep)

Fitch Rates NTBs Basel III sub-debt issue A-(lka) (EXP)
	
Fitch Ratings has assigned Nations Trust Bank PLCs (NTB, A(lka)/Stable) Sri Lanka rupee-denominated proposed Basel III-compliant subordinated unsecured debentures an expected National Long-Term Rating of A-(lka)(EXP).
The debentures, totalling LKR3.5 billion, will have maturities of five years and carry fixed coupons. The debentures qualify as regulatory Tier II capital for the bank and include a non-viability clause.
The bank plans to use the proceeds to support its loan book expansion and to strengthen its Tier II capital base. The debentures are to be listed on the Colombo Stock Exchange.
The final rating is subject to the receipt of final documentation conforming to information already received.
Fitch rates the proposed Basel III Tier II notes one notch below the banks National Long-Term Rating of A(lka). This reflects the notes higher loss-severity risks compared with senior unsecured instruments due to the notes subordinated status.
The notes include a non-viability trigger that would convert the notes to equity upon the occurrence of a trigger event, as determined by the Monetary Board of Sri Lanka.
NTBs National Long-Term Rating is used as the anchor rating because the rating reflects the banks standalone financial strength. Fitch believes that the banks standalone credit profile best indicates the risk of becoming non-viable.
Fitch has not differentiated the notching on the proposed notes from the notching on NTBs legacy Tier II notes as it is assumed that the authorities would step in late, moving the point of non-viability close to liquidation.
Fitch has not applied additional notching to the notes for non-performance risk according to Fitchs criteria, as the notes have no going-concern loss-absorption features.
NTBs ratings reflect its declining capitalisation, modest franchise and high product concentration.
The rating of the notes would move in tandem with NTBs National Long-Term Rating.

Fitch rates Seylan Banks Basel III sub debt BBB+(lka)(EXP)
	
Fitch Ratings has assigned Seylan Bank PLCs (A-(lka)/Stable) proposed Basel III-compliant subordinated debentures an expected National Long Term Rating of BBB+(lka)(EXP).
The debentures will have tenors of five, seven and 10 years and carry fixed coupons.
Seylan Bank PLC this August said it would issue five and 10-year debentures to raise up to Rs.10 billion to strengthen its regulatory Tier II capital adequacy ratio, which was seen weakening amid growing risk weighted assets or the banks loan portfolio.
The debentures are to be listed on the Colombo Stock Exchange and the bank plans to use the proceeds to fund loan growth, strengthen its funding mix, reduce structural maturity mismatches and reduce its short-term borrowings.
The final rating is subject to the receipt of final documentation conforming to information already received.
Fitch rates the proposed Tier II instrument one notch below Seylans standalone rating to reflect the debentures subordinated status and higher loss-severity risks relative to senior unsecured instruments.
The debentures would convert to equity upon the occurrence of a trigger event, as determined by the Monetary Board of Sri Lanka.
Seylans standalone rating, which is at the same level as its support-driven National Long-Term Rating of A-(lka), is used as the anchor rating as we believe the banks standalone credit profile best indicates the risk of becoming non-viable. Fitch believes that state support cannot be relied upon to flow through to Seylans BASEL III-compliant debentures due to the instruments loss-absorption feature at the occurrence of the trigger event.
Fitch has not differentiated the notching on the proposed debentures from the notching on Seylans legacy Tier II debentures. This is because we assume that the authorities would step in late, moving the point of non-viability close to liquidation.
Fitch has not applied additional notching to the debentures for non-performance risk, in line with Fitchs criteria, as they have no going-concern loss-absorption features. Seylans subordinated debenture ratings will move in tandem with its standalone rating, which is currently at the same level as its support-driven National Long Term Rating.
A downgrade of Seylans standalone rating could result from a large reversal in recent asset quality improvements, together with a weakening financial profile. An upgrade of Seylans rating would be contingent on further improvements in its standalone profile through improved asset quality and provisioning, mainly stemming from recovery of legacy non-performing loans, while maintaining its other credit metrics in line with higher-rated peers.

HSBC awarded Best Consumer Digital Bank for 11thtime by Global Finance
	
HSBC Sri Lanka has once again been recognised for its digital capabilities by winning the Best Consumer Digital Bank Country award by Global Finance at the Best Digital Bank Awards 2017, and this is the 11th time that HSBC has won this prestigious award.
Currently, around 77 percent of the total Retail Banking transactions of HSBC Sri Lanka are being performed through its automated channels including HSBC Online Banking, HSBC Easy Pay and ATM network.
HSBCs Online Banking platform is built on world-class technology with high security and equipped to perform a range of banking services such as balance enquiries, online statement viewing, transferring of funds between own or third party accounts to bill payments and management of personal accounts (i.e. canceling any direct debits, amending standing orders and other). These capabilities were further enhanced with the launch of HSBCs Mobile Banking App earlier this year, enabling customers to access their accounts on-the-go. Through the Mobile Banking app, HSBC has introduced a Digital Secure Key and access through Touch ID. HSBC is one of the few banks to provide biometric authentication through the Touch ID feature for Apple iPhone users and to facilitate two-factor authentication using the Digital Secure Key, which is a
first in the market.
Furthermore, through the launch of the HSBCs Mobile App, the bank provides an extra layer of security for mobile banking customers with features such as transaction data signing for third party payments.

New entry period for US Diversity Visa
	
The registration period for the US diversity visa (DV-2019) has been revised due to technical issues, the US Embassy said today.
In a statement, it said the new entry period would be open for electronic entries on October 18 from 11:00 am to November 22 until 11:00 am.
Due to the new entry period, all entries made prior to October 18, 2017 should be resubmitted for the entrant to be considered, it said.
The technical issue was the failure to properly account for country of eligibility if the entrant was selecting a country of eligibility other than his/her place of birth, which is permitted in certain limited circumstances.
This was not a result of any outside interference or hacking attempt. We regret the inconvenience to Diversity Visa entrants. In order to ensure fairness and protect the integrity of the process for all those concerned, however, we must restart the entry process for this year (DV-2019).
An application entered before Wednesday, October 18, 2017 will not be considered and another entry must be submitted during the new registration period, the statement said.
Applicants may submit one new entry without being disqualified for submitting multiple entries.
Individuals who submit more than one entry during the new registration period will be disqualified.
Applicants can access the electronic DV entry form (E-DV) at the official E-DV website, dvlottery.state.gov, during the registration period. DV instructions are also available on the Department of States public webpage at usvisas.state.gov/dv/instructions. All other eligibility requirements remain the same.
Beginning May 15, 2018, DV-2019 entrants will be able to use their unique confirmation number provided at registration to check the online Entrant Status Check at dvlottery.state.gov to see if their entry was selected.
Entrant Status Check will inform successful entrants how to apply for DVs for themselves and their eligible family members. The Department will also confirm visa interview appointments through the Entrant Status Check.

No point in blasting public servants: JO to PM
	
The joint opposition said today there was no point in Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe blasting public servants for failing to deliver relief to flood victims when no funds had been released by the Treasury to carry out such work.
JO MP Bandula Gunawardena said the economy was in a state of stagnation because of the short-sighted fiscal policies of the government.
Former finance minister Ravi Karunanayake should be held responsible for this crisis situation because the relevant officials had not received the funds that were allocated for this purpose. In 2016, he had failed to release 32% of the funds allocated to the education sector. In the case of the 2016 Budget, he had failed to use 20% of the allocated funds. When there is no currency in circulation, how can people spend money, he told a news briefing.
He said the economic crisis had worsened from 2001 to 2004 and former president Mahinda Rajapaksa had to overcome this crisis in 2005.
However, he resuscitated the economy gradually and reduced the quantum of state loans. When there was the war, the amount of loans increased. The balance debt was reduced to 71.3 per cent by 2014 but it had increased abnormally since 2015. The Auditor General's reports say the debt had been increased to 83.3 per cent today, he said.

PTLs inter-group transactions concealed ultimate destination of funds: Senior Banker
	
Testifying before the PCoI yesterday, current Monetary Board member and senior banker Nihal Fonseka said the routine adopted by Perpetual Treasuries Ltd to transfer funds through its related group companies was to conceal the ultimate destination of the payments.
At the onset of yesterdays proceedings, Mr. Fonseka testified before the Presidential Commission of Inquiry (PCoI).
Deputy Solicitor General Milinda Gunatilleke led the evidence producing several bank statements and swift messages relating to Perpetual Treasuries Ltd and its related group of companies.
DSG Gunatilleke submitted the documents through the witness to show that PTL had transferred money to its related companies. On the same day (most of the times) the related companies had sent cash cheques to PTL and the officials at PTL had kept the money on PTL CEO Kasun Palisenas chair after encashing the cheques from the relevant banks.
The following three grids show how these transactions had been carried out.
1
-Perpetual Treasuries Ltd had transferred funds amounting Rs.15.6 million (through a Union Bank account) to Perpetual Capital Holdings (2015-16 period).
-Thereafter Perpetual Capital Holdings had drawn cash cheques corresponding to the payments it received from PTL. (Cheques were signed mainly by Arjun Aloysius, Geoffrey Aloysius and Surendran Muthuraja who was the Chairman of W.M Mendis & Company)
-Cash cheques had been sent to PTL office again.
-PTL officers had encashed the cheques at different times.
-The money had been then given to PTL CEO Kasun Palisena
- PTL officials were unaware what happened to the money thereafter
2
-Perpetual Treasuries Ltd had transferred funds amounting to Rs.44 million (through a Pan Asia Bank account) to Perpetual Capital Pvt (2015-16 period)
-Thereafter Perpetual Capital Pvt had drawn cash cheques corresponding to the payments it received from PTL. (Cheques were signed mainly by Arjun Aloysius, Geoffrey Aloysius and Surendran Muthuraja)
-Cash cheques had been sent to PTL office again.
-PTL officers had encashed the cheques at different times.
-The money then given to PTL CEO Kasun Palisena
- PTL officials unaware what happened to the money thereafter
3
-Perpetual Treasuries Ltd had transferred funds amounting to Rs.79 million (through Bank of Ceylon) to W.M. Mendis & Company (2015-16)
-Thereafter W.M. Mendis & Company had drawn cash cheques corresponding to the payments it received from PTL. (Cheques were signed mainly by Arjun Aloysius, Geoffrey Aloysius and Surendran Muthuraja)
-Cash cheques had been sent to PTL office again.
-PTL officers had encashed the cheques at different times.
-The money had been then given to PTL CEO Kasun Palisena
- PTL officials unaware what happened to the money thereafter
These transactions which took place between PTL and its related companies were regarded as the netted-off transactions by Kasun Palisena. It was revealed that the payments made by PTL to its related companies were born out of these netted-off transactions.
During the questioning, DSG Gunatillke also pointed to a transaction amounting to Rs.1 million and said that it was a significant fund transfer which was identical to an amount that transpired in a phone conversation played before the Commission. It speaks of a payment given to one Little Johnny.
DSG Gunatilleke then asked the witness several questions on the routine adopted by PTL to transfer money as the witness was an expert in the banking industry.
DSG Gunatilleke: Is this how a corporate entity would withdraw its money
Witness Nihal Fonseka: No
DSG Gunatillke: What could be the purpose of having such a routine to withdraw cash
Witness: In my opinion the person who was originating the fund transfers would have wanted to conceal the ultimate destination of the money.
At this moment Justice Prasanna Jayawardena adding some amusement to the query said Ultimate destination other than a chair.
DSG Gunatilleke then questioned the witness on the auctions held in March 2016 and the State banks' meeting which was said to have been called by then Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake before the auctions.
When questioned by the DSG, the witness said State banks biding at lower rates had material effect on the auctions.
Referring to a particular ISIN (International Securities Identification Number) advertised on March 29, 2016 auction, the witness said there was a loss of Rs.550 million to the government from that particular ISIN mainly due to the EPF not bidding at the auction with its full of potential.
March 29, 2016 auction
- EPF bids Rs.1 billion at the Primary Auction for a particular ISIN at a price of Rs.87 for a Rs.100 bond.
-The settlement date of that auction was April 1, and the EPF carries an excess of Rs.9.9 billion on settlement day.
-However, without bidding at the Primary Auction and having possessed enough funds, the EPF buys Rs.10 billion worth of bonds bearing the same ISIN in the secondary market after a week of the auction (first week of April 2016) at a price of Rs.95 and 97 from PTL.
-EPF had bid a volume of Rs.1 billion at a rate of 13.6% at the auction for that particular ISIN.
-But the CBSL needed to accept up to Rs.10 billion at the auction.
-The rest of the accepted bids were at a rate of 14.8% largely from PTL.
The witness was of the view that if the EPF had bid a larger amount (Rs.10 billion) at the Primary Auction without buying the same bonds in the secondary market, the CBSL could have obtained the borrowings at a lesser rate (13.6%) without accepting the amount at a higher rate (14.8%) at the auction.
According to the witness it was revealed that by buying the same bonds just after the primary auction in the secondary market by the EPF it had incurred losses to itself while at the same time the CBSL had also incurred losses for accepting bids at a higher rate while having the opportunity to obtain them at a lower rate from EPF.

Put off polls till new PS' are set up: TPA
	
The Tamil Progressive Alliance (TPA) Leader and Minister, Mano Ganesan said yesterday said the local government election would have to be postponed by a few days to grant his partys demand to increase the number of Pradeshiya Sabhas in the Nuwara Eliya District.
He told a media briefing that the local government election would be definitely held in January next year.
The elections will have to be postponed only by few days not weeks or months because of our demand could be held before the end of January 2018, the minister said and added that the groundwork has been carried out to create seven more Pradeshiya Sabhas in this district.
The minister dismissed claims made by the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) that he was being used by the government to delay the elections.
No one can use me as a cats paw, he said and added that President Maithirpala Sirisena had assured the TPA that the upcoming PS elections would be held only after creating new Pradeshiya Sabhas in the Nuwara Eliya District.
The minister said this assurance was given at a discussion held between the TPA and the President recently.
Justifying the TPA demand, the minister said were 225,000 voters in the Ambegamuwa PS and it was best that new Pradeshiya Sabhas are set up there. We are not demanding for police powers or to merge provincial councils like the Tamil parties based in the North are doing and therefore our demand is nothing but fair, he said.
When asked why the TPA waited for so long to make the demand, Mr Ganesan said they made the request during the delimitation process but the authorities ignored it.
The TPA is expected to meet Local Government and Provincial Councils Minister Faizer Mustapha today to discuss this matter. (Yohan Perera)

Release those detained under PTA: TNA
	
The Tamil National Alliance (TNA) will move an adjournment motion seeking the immediate release of those held under the Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA).
Opposition and TNA Leader R. Sampanthan, who is expected to move the motion, said Sri Lanka had accepted both domestically and internationally that the Prevention of Terrorism Law is draconian, obnoxious and should therefore be regarded as obsolete.
The Sri Lankan State has made several commitments both domestically and internationally that the said Law will be repealed, and that a new Law will be enacted in keeping with acceptable domestic and international norms. The Sri Lankan State is yet to fulfil this commitment, but that does not derogate from the Sri Lanka States commitment that the said Law should not remain on the Statute Book.) The only evidence available against most of these persons are confessions extracted from them against their will under the Prevention of Terrorism Law which would be inadmissible against them in a normal Court of Law. Many of the cases have been postponed because the Prosecution is not ready to proceed with the Cases. Almost all of them have been in custody for very long periods of time, for as long as, they would have been sentenced, if sentence was passed on them shortly after being taken into custody. The families of these persons in custody have suffered for very long periods of time, without the support of their bread winners. This vitally important factor has not been given due consideration, the motion says. Also, the TNA said those, arrested during the JVP insurrections, were granted a general amnesty, and asked why the same principle could not be applied to Tamil PTA detainees.
These cases cannot be considered as coming purely under the purview of the Attorney Generals Department. With due respect to the Hon. Attorney General as the Chief Legal Adviser of the State, these cases have a certain political dimension and cannot be addressed as a purely legal issue. It can be justifiably stated that if Sri Lankas national question had been reasonably addressed in time, many of the persons in custody, would not have been in their present position and would have been useful citizens. This circumstance makes it obligatory that you address this issue politically too. The issue not being addressed politically is a strong impediment to reconciliation and the restoration of goodwill and harmony. An unnecessary complication has been created by the transfer of some cases from Vavuniya to Anuradhapura. If witnesses needed. 0protection, such protection could have been provided without the cases being transferred, the motion states.

Revolutionizing education through technology
	
In the present day and age, there is a variety of technology that is available to us. But how much of it do we use in order to develop our education Ladies College has taken this step forward as it launched the Smart Classrooms on Monday, October 16, funded and organized by the Old Girls Association (OGA). The initial stages of the smart classroom is the setting up of a smart board. The smart board includes a smart interactive display, a UPS unit and also a set of desktop speakers. When you say smart classroom, its a full fledged solution. At the moment we are in the process of enabling the teachers, which is why we have put this smart board only. Much later on, the students will have their own device and certain software and collaboration tools will be included which would enable all the students to connect with the teacher and with the device and they would be able to complete problems with interaction, explained Preethi Adhihetty, President of the OGA.

Everything is changing and in Sri Lanka in particular, we are not really using the technology that is available in order to improve our teaching and learning.
 Preethi Adhihetty


She further said that it is a ten point touch enabled device so two or more students will be able to interact with the board at the same time. The teachers can also upload their own content for the benefits of teaching. The board is capable of connecting to any network. You can even connect it to an access point in terms of having a local area network, like an intranet where for each classroom you can have an access point where the students are able to connect, which is part of the full fledged solution. 
Enlightening us on how the project was started off Adhihetty said, When our OGA decided to have our dance I met up with Eesha and since she is refurbishing areas of the school, I told her that I am not interested in giving money for buildings but I want to do something else for the school. It was then her idea and her vision and far thinking which got me going for this. All she asked me was for a screen and a laptop for a few classes because teachers waste time walking to another classroom transporting the laptop, setting it up and finding connections. Then I got a few old girls who are knowledgeable in that area to get involved and they are the ones that introduced me to EWIS. They came on board, they showed and demonstrated their product which we were actually quite impressed with.
In terms of collecting funds, she said that the money came from sponsors and old girls and parents supported and contributed. All in all there was a good response to this project.
I never imagined that I would be able to get it for the whole school. I was adamant to collect enough money for the entire school. And within January to September we managed to collect for the whole school. 54 interactive boards are being installed in school. From Kindergarten to the Upper School. And this is the first time in Sri Lanka that a whole school has got interactive smart boards, said Adhihetty.
She further said, Everything is changing and in Sri Lanka in particular, we are not really using the technology that is available in order to improve our teaching and learning.That is why we need to have this technology in our classrooms, in our schools in order to enhance the teaching and the learning experience. So to start off with the current set up which is the normal textbooks, blackboard and the white board, which traditionally was in use and is still in use. That is not going to change, that has to be there because that is a fundamental component. These interactive devices and this sort of a solution in our smart classroom only enables them to enhance their experience.


I believe that all of us should be able to adapt ourselves and learn to change

- Eesha Speldewinde

There are different types of learners, some are visual learners, some are auditory learners and some are tactile learners. So if you have the existing set up and on top of that if you have the interactive devices you basically cater to all these different styles of learners. She added
Preethi Adhihetty further said that this would improve teaching methods and styles.We are also enabling the teachers to teach in a more effective way using the current cutting edge devices. With the smart interactive boards, concentration and engagement in classrooms are much more than the conventional method of teaching. 
Explaining on how the teachers will adapt to this, Adhihetty said that a training programme is in place. We will start from the basic level on how you can use the device in terms of hardware. What you can do with it, how do you use the ports, what each port does, how to switch it on and off etc. Then we move on to the operating system. The next stage would be the software and the latter stage would be on the content. We can train the teachers to build their own content. They will make use of these software and they will build their own content and in that manner they will themselves learn. In addition there are so many communities online where different teachers from different parts of the globe contribute to these communities so when they build their content it can be something like a knowledge bank where they can share their content and they can get from others.
Speaking of what they hope to achieve through this endeavour, she said We will be motivating our students and I think we are revolutionizing the school into the digital world.
I am ecstatic and very proud to be able to do this for the whole school. It was not just me, the whole executive committee of the OGA was behind it and they were all very supportive. Adhihetty proclaimed

The better half of a provincial purohita has become a veritable thorn in the side of the white collar high-ups of this Ministry, they say.

This fair one who has arrogated to herself the powers of the purohita has made it a practice to interfere in the workaday affairs in the Ministry. She would give the Ministry high-ups instructions regarding matters which are none of her business and she would even direct them to submit to her for signature or approval certain documents which the boss himself should attend to, an informed source said.
This fair one, the daughter of parents who had used political clout seems to think that the right to exercise power and authority is a family heirloom.
The henpecked purohita in question despite knowing that his wife has become a meddling nuisance to the Ministry staff would not dare question her actions, they say.

Tailor made FDs with Nations Trust Banks Flexi Deposit Scheme
	
Nations Trust Bank introduces Nations Flexi Deposit, a scheme tailor-made for fixed deposits with a flexible investment period of the customers own choosing to receive the benefits of high interest earnings.
This scheme enables the customer to choose a flexible investment period ranging from a minimum of 30 days to a maximum of 365 days for fixed deposits with attractive interest rates relative to the investment period.
Flexi Deposit is specially designed for when one wishes to hold significant funds in cash for short periods before reinvesting them. Flexi Deposit accounts can be opened as individual or joint accounts by resident Sri Lankan nationals or resident foreign nationals holding a valid Sri Lankan resident visa. Speaking about the launch of Nations Flexi Deposit, Nations Trust Bank Head of Branches Sheahan Daniel said: Even when funds are not required immediately, customers are often reluctant to open fixed deposits because of the inflexible deposit periods. For example, if you want your money in a fixed deposit for 50 days, with normal fixed deposits in the market this is not possible.
Customers are required to open a one or a two month FD therefore deciding against a FD at all. With the introduction of Flexi Fixed Deposit, customers are free to choose the length of their deposit period anywhere from 30 to 365 days with interest rates varying to the deposit period chosen by the customer. This flexibility in regard to an investment period is what makes this product very suitable for short term investments of cash holdings.

Ven.Bhikkuni Kusuma  felicitated
	
Ven. Bhikkuni Kusuma (MA, PhD), a towering figure in the Bhikkuni Sasana in Sri Lanka, was felicitated recently as a consummate spiritual warrior who practices the Buddhas path to perfection and is widely revered and respected for her noble aim of leading many others to spiritual liberation through the teachings of the Buddha. 
The felicitation ceremony at the Kelani Rajamaha Vihara on September 27, coincided with her 88th birthday. 


Ven. Bhikkuni Kusuma is a fully ordained Buddhist nun from Sri Lanka who has pioneered the re-establishment of Theravada Female Buddhist Order in Sri Lanka. She is the first woman (her lay name being Kusuma Devendra) in Sri Lanka to don the robes of a Bhikkuni after a lapse of the Bhikkuni order for nearly 1,000 years. She holds BA (1974), and MA (1982) in Therawada Buddhism. She received her PhD (1999) from the Buddhist and Pali University of Sri Lanka.
Her doctorial dissertation on Bhikkuni Vinaya (rules of discipline for ordained Buddhist nuns) is regarded as a manual for Buddhist nuns in Sri Lanka. She is a well published scholar who has participated in several international conferences. Now in her late eighties, she continues with courage and determination to bring about higher ordination of Bhikkunis in Sri Lanka and abroad. Ven. Bhikkuni, whose abode in Sri Lanka is the meditation retreat, Arya Kema International Buddhist Meditation Centre,Olaboduwa, off Gonapola, Horana, periodically travels overseas to teach meditation.

Mrs. Kusuma Devendra entered the order of Buddhist nuns in 1996 as Ven. Bhikkuni Kusuma at the Kelaniya Rajamaha Viharaya and I remember as if it were yesterday that I administered her the precepts (Seela) of a Bhikkuni. I find it as a significant event in my personal life and in the history of the Kelaniya temple. Bhikkuni Kusuma has been respected by the Mahasangha in the country.
Addressing the felicitation ceremony Chief Incumbent of the Kelaniya Rajamaha Vihara and Ven. Prof. Kollupitiye Mahinda Sangharakkita Thera said Ven. Bhikkuni Kusuma who pioneered the revival of Bhikkuni Sasana in Sri Lanka would go down in the annals of history of Buddha Sasana as an exalted teacher dedicated to the arduous spiritual path and commands high recognition for her dedicated service to the Bhikkuni Sasana in Sri Lanka.

She was destined to receive her higher ordination under the tutelage of then President of the Mahabodhi Society Ven Mapalagama Vipulasra Thera at the Migadaya in Isipathana where the Buddha had preached the first discourse Dhamma Chakka Pavattana Sutta. Then other Bhikkunis with her received the higher ordination. It was the revival of higher ordination in the Bhikkuni Sasana in Sri Lanka. Ven. Bhikkuni Kusuma deserves the respect of every Buddhist for her dedication, unstinted courage and determination in re-establishing the Bhikkuni Sasana in Sri Lanka after a long interval of about 1000 years. Ven. Mahinda Sangharakkitha Thera further said.
The two day  Guru Upahara felicitation ceremony organised by student Bhikkunis and the lay disciples of the Ven. Bhikkuni Kusuma included preaching of sermons, Pirith chanting, KapRuk Poojas, Buddha Poojas, and meditation session. Ven. Bhikkuni Kusuma delivered an Anusasana.
