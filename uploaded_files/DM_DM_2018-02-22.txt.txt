Centenarian war hero fights for lost land
	

Pathiranage Edmond David Silva, who lives in Polonnaruwa, appeals to the President to return his paddy fields taken over by the Department of Wildlife Conservation
He is a father of 11 children, passing the 103rd year of his life. This father, whose name is Pathiranage Edmond David Silva, was known as the Maha Kalu Sinhalaya (a term used in Sinhala
to describe a Sri Lankan with a dark complexion and strong physique). He had not only joined World War 11 (two) to wage war, but also launch a struggle on behalf his rights to cultivate crops for his livelihood in the Polonnaruwa District. His went down memory lane to tell us his life story. 
I sold rice stealthily with the Kaffirs. I travelled daily from Trincomalee in the lorries used by armed forces during those days. I travelled in the guise of coming to buy the provisions to cater to ex-service men. During those days there was a shortage of rice in the country. We ate imported rice. The Kaffir gentlemen were my close friends. When they came, they brought two or three bags of paddy. I sold them to the shops and got Rs.15 and gave Rs.5 to them. They drank toddy with that money, said Silva. 
During World War 11, the British soldiers had set up camps in Trincomalee and Hingurakgoda. The official residence of top Army officers was built at a distance from the other army camps due to security reasons. Accordingly, the official residences had been built limiting their service of Hingurakgoda and Trincomalee camps in the present village called Sewagama which was earlier known as Sewa muktha. It comprised several units. He said that there were separate houses for ordinary soldiers and top officers of the army in a town which boasted of all amenities. 
I was born on 5th October 1914 in Beliatta in Matara. The name of my wife was Rani Pathirana. We came here after our marriage. I joined the army. They told me that I would be sent to Polonnaruwa and theyd give me a pin ticket (presently known as railway pass). When we arrived by train to Polonnaruwa, the English soldiers took us to our official residence. The duty I was assigned was to supply food, other items and the provisions that would be taken to Hingurakgoda and Trincomalee camps. I am the cleaner of the vehicle. Although the driver of the vehicle was a Kaffir, he was a close friend of mine. There was a toddy tavern in a Muslim village called Sabath Div. We drank toddy with the money we together with the Kaffirs stole, be reminisced. 
What I have to tell the President is that the paddy fields where we worked have been taken over by the Department of Wildlife Conservation. We have filed action against this take over in courts
Deceiving the enemy 
According to him, he had three children at that time and had begun to cultivate there. He explained that there were no so-called carnivorous Kaffirs and they were lies told by the people. Sri Lanka had been bombed and the airport was covered with the branches of trees, to make it resemble a grassland. The British men cultivated Salvinia on those tanks, so that they would resemble a grassland, all done with the motive of deceiving the enemy and destroying aeroplanes, after they landed. 
The British soldiers left the country after the war. During this period, Prime Minister D.S.Senanayake distributed blocks of land in the dry zone. I also got a block which spanned 50 acres from an area called Galmulla Kanda in Somawathi Forest. I cultivated it. I had 120 cattle, 80 goats and 150 poultry. I got 75 bottles of milk those days and the cost of one bottle was 25 cents. A bushel of paddy was Rs 10. A leopard had entered the goat shed and killed 14 goats, but not eaten any of the dead. The main problem faced by us during those days was protecting our crops from wild animals, he said. 
Aralu nuts his secret for longevityThis man can surprise any visitor to his residence because at the age of 103 he can still munch an arecanut, which is eaten with betel, quite easily with his strong teeth. He stated that the present generation of people eat everything, which is harmful, and added that his teeth are still strong due to the fact that he had consumed an Aralu nut daily. Having drunk half a bottle of arrack and smoked 30 cigarettes daily in the bygone days, he had also cultivated 30  40 acres of land in addition to the land ( 50 acres) given to him by the Government. 
We lived with in harmony with the Muslims during those days. It was a Muslim who had first seen Somawathi Chetiya. People, irrespective of community, did not engage in any act that was harmful to this forest. I visit Somawathi Chethiya as a Buddhist even today to pay my respects. There were many wild animals in this forest, but nobody killed them. Some LTTE cadres had climbed the chethiya to steal the Crest Gem, but they had fallen down the dagaba and died. One day, the wildlife officers had borrowed two bags of rice from the shop mentioning my name. However, I paid for the value of the rice willingly. We made arrangements to start a fast in front of Temple Trees. This was after the authorities showed no interest to entertain us after I made a request to pay children some money if they engaged in employment during weekends. I requested that the money should be deposited in their bank accounts and that they shouldnt have access to it till they reached age 30. But the Police did not allow us to meet Government leaders, he said. 
The British soldiers left the country after the war. During this period, Prime Minister D.S.Senanayake distributed blocks of land in the dry zone. I also got a block which spanned 50 acres
Children doing well 
He added that he had entered politics after the incident. He had conflicts with his political opponents during that time as well. According to him, the present President Maithripala Sirisena, at that time, was a Grama Sevaka in a village in Kegalla. When I met him near a tea kiosk I would give him a cup of tea and go. Silva had fathered 11 children, but now three of them are dead. One of his sons, Deshappriya Silva, is a professor at Ruhunu University. His other children are engaged in either teaching, farming or doing business and live happily. 
In conclusion he said, I have lived a long life and am happy with all my past activities. Every year I give three bags of rice as alms to be used at Danasals (Places offering free meals) at Somawathi Chethiya. What I have to tell the President is that the paddy fields where we worked have been taken over by the Department of Wildlife Conservation. We have filed action against this take over in courts. The deeds for these lands had been given to us by the Queen. Four generations of our families had worked in those fields spanning a period of about 100 years. We request the President to provide us with some lands from somewhere else. The type of paddy sown in these fields is not cultivated anywhere in Sri Lanka.They are cultivated without fertilizer or chemicals. I have lived a long life by consuming that rice. I request the President to do this on behalf of the general public. 
Silva is known by everyone living in Sinhala and Muslim villages in Polonnaruwa to Somawathiya. He is a war hero ( Ranaviruwa). He plays multiple roles as farmer, social worker and father to his children. He still lives in Sewa Muktha Village and boasts of a health that fits a youth. He doesnt complain of having any disease and is a prolific reader. All his loved ones and villagers offer their blessing to him to enjoy more years years on planet earth sans sickness.

## Title: Child protection in Sri Lanka Lapses at NCPA pose questions about competency
## Section: Expose

Child protection in Sri Lanka Lapses at NCPA pose questions about competency
	
As mentioned before, Sri Lanka was a signatory to the Child Rights Convention (CRC) back in 1990
	
	In December 1996 the Presidential Task Force on child protection was appointed
	
	Back in 2016, the NCPA made headlines over a case where an official was accused of abusing a child

Protecting the rights of every citizen is a necessity. But where do children place themselves in this picture Children  those who should be nurtured to take the mantle of this world forward- are in most instances the neglected lot. Child protection also takes a similar stance. Sri Lanka ratified the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child on July 12, 1991 and has since taken measures to implement the rights of children within the constraints of the prevailing context and Governmental structures. 

The demand by the public for a child protection system received a response from the Government when the latter set up the National Child Protection Authority (NCPA). According to child rights experts, child protection is a non  judgmental, non-adversarial, civil and multi-disciplinary approach which needs to be systematically done in the best interest of the child. But the Daily Mirror learned that creating a chaotic situation in this hallowed institution, summoning of regular meetings had been stopped leading up to various repercussions including the non-allocation of necessary funds, neglecting the payment of salaries to employees, maintenance and most importantly deviating from its primary objective  the protection of the rights children. If the present situation continues and necessary funds are not received, investigations, both new and ongoing, would be hindered. 
Hence, the Daily Mirror sheds light on the allegations thrown at the NCPA while also focusing on the NCPA National Policy to be launched this year and thoughts from individuals of varied expertise.

Role of NCPA
As mentioned before, Sri Lanka was a signatory to the Child Rights Convention (CRC) back in 1990 and this was ratified on July 12, 1991. It was then followed by the preparation of a Childrens Charter approved by the Cabinet of Ministers and establishing of a National Monitoring Committee charged with the responsibility to monitor the CRC and also report to the international CRC committee when required. In December 1996 the Presidential Task Force on child protection was appointed and one of its important recommendations was the establishment of the NCPA by Act No. 50 of 1998 under the Presidential Secretariat. While various functions have been listed as their priorities, the main role of the NCPA is to create a child-friendly and protective environment for the children, free from all forms of abuse.

Alleged protection of child abuser
Back in 2016, the NCPA made headlines over a case where an official was accused of abusing a child. According to sources the incident occurred during a school debating competition organized by the NCPA. The alleged official was said to have had unusual contacts with a school boy in a leading school in Kurunegala for a period of one month. While this official holds a powerful position and is a favourite among those in higher seats at the NCPA, the then Chairperson hasnt taken any action. With many protests from employees, this individual still remains with the organization. The incident however was swept under the carpet as means of protecting the individual and continuing his service. The Daily Mirror also learned that he had erased vital sources of evidence, so as to mislead the investigation which was carried out. While it is a conflict of interest to house such individuals in a child protection authority, sources also revealed that those in higher positions have gone to extremes to clear the case. This resulted in the removal of responsible officials and appointing people with limited knowledge about child protection to office.

National Policy
In December 2014, the Cabinet of Ministers issued an important direction to the Ministry of Women and Childrens Affairs and the National Child Protection Authority. (see attached documents) This states inter alia that existing policies are insufficient to ensure child protection; that Institutions face difficulties in giving effect to current policies; that all State institutions engaged in ensuring the protection of children must act upon a common agreement and that an integrated mechanism must deal with child care, protection and rehabilitation. Hence it shows that before the NCPA officers made their demand this year, this has always been the Government policy which is clear as the Act. But in a different turn of events, a final version of the NCPA National Policy is currently being drafted by a Committee headed by its Founder Chairman Prof. Harendra De Silva. When asked why this Policy needs to be drafted when theres a Cabinet direction and an Act, Prof. Harendra said that he was not in office in 2014 and that previous plans hadnt been accepted so far.
			
			
			A policy for child protection must give ownership to all public services relating to child protection
			
			
		Airing his concerns to the Daily Mirror, former NCPA Deputy Chairman Sajeeva Samaranayake who was sacked in an unwelcomed move by the President last year said that it is a must to re-educate all sectors of society that child protection is not a media-based event, but a process and crisis intervention in the life of a child. This process must have a clear beginning and a measurable outcome for the child. State resources committed to child protection must be utilized wisely to integrate this process into our existing public service system. The child protection process has clearly identified steps and each one must be carefully developed with the officers concerned, so that interfaces between departments are managed and two officers  for example a teacher and police officer, are able to cooperate for the sake of the child. Other activities carried out under the banner of child protection, which are limited, ad hoc, uncoordinated and un-sustainable are simply other activities and they have no direct relevance to the actual children who need protection,said Samaranayake. 
He further said that there is no magic in the word policy. A policy for child protection must give ownership to all public services relating to child protection and make space to facilitate their working together and developing a common agreement and a pool of expertise on the subject in the long run. This must be a seriously worked out process that builds the learning capacity and professionalism of direct service providers. No single document can do this. However, the Human Rights Action Plan 2017-21 has outlined a process to attain this objective. That Plan should not be confined to paper, Samaranayake suggested.


Employees Association of NCPA (EANCPA) Media Secretary Pradeep Coswatte said that three executive committee meetings for 2018 hadnt been held so far. As a result, the NCPA Action Plan has not been passed and the treasury cannot allocate funds for NCPA projects. Therefore payments of employees, investigations conducted for complaints coming through the helpline and other important activities are now being affected. It has been observed that the director board hasnt shown an interest to attend meetings presided by the Chairperson and when the NCPA secretary attempted to call meetings, the Chairperson didnt allow it as well. With all these irregularities, the Association is now at a dormant stage and everybody from the President, Prime Minister and the subject minister should be responsible for this situation. It was the President himself who elected the present Chairperson and the Association doesnt seem to be moving ahead with its plan. However on the contrary, the current Chairperson is trying to highlight various projects that the NCPA has planned for the year to cover-up this chaotic situation from the public,said Coswatte.
			
			
			Sadly, all perpetrators have been supported in the past and they now claim to be powerful
			
			
		
			
			
			
			
			
			
			
			
			
			
			The staff should be held accountable, but unfortunately things have got diluted along the way
			
			
		In response to these allegations, Marini De Livera, Chairperson of the NCPA said that certain parties are trying to create chaos within the organization. Certain parties are surprised to see a Government institution functioning so well and therefore they are trying to sling mud at us. I have even appeared in courts for a child who has undergone corporal punishment. We have received foreign funding and we have planned out various activities for the betterment of children. Sadly, all perpetrators have been supported in the past and they now claim to be powerful. Therefore some sabotage has been done to prevent meetings and block treasury funds coming in to carry these activities forward. We are committed to protect the rights of every child and currently we are doing a cleaning up process to eliminate those who have hidden agendas and are trying to bring our reputation down, said Livera. 
When asked about the incident when an NCPA official was allegedly involved with keeping unusual contacts with a schoolboy, Livera further questioned how one can build up a case without a complaint from the parents or the schoolboy. There are vicious elements trying to sling mud at us, but we are unafraid and we will certainly move forward, she said.
The Daily Mirror also spoke to Dr. Hiranthi Wijemanne, former NCPA Chairperson and Vice Chairperson of the UN Monitoring Committee on the Rights of the Child, who responded by saying that the NCPA focuses on protecting the rights of a child. Therefore an abuse, neglect, corporal punishment or other similar matters are taken into consideration. Unfortunately the rights of a child havent been recognized. Initially the NCPA was under the Presidential Secretariat and it had more powers. But with the change in regimes it was included as an organization under the Child Development and Womens Affairs Ministry. With that it was no more a powerful institution like in the past that could send a letter on a Presidential secretariat letterhead. Unfortunately, the Ministry and the NCPA dont have a good relationship and there are certain challenges faced by the NCPA as at now. However its the responsibility of the Ministry to be involved with its activities and continue to work for the betterment of the children.
Their responsibility is greater because it is the children who are involved on the other end. Theres something wrong with the system and time has now come to investigate these irregularities, probe into any pressing issues and clear the doubts of the public. Its important to set targets and work towards achieving them. There has to be a performance evaluation process and regulation of guidelines within the Association. The staff should be held accountable, but unfortunately things have got diluted along the way. Its important to table a new set of recommendations and implement any plans that have been discussed. But its my duty to say that every day lost in taking an action, whether its a case of an abuse, neglect or other issue relating to a child, it impacts an entire generation.

Legal experts say written agreements unnecessary: Speaker
	
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya told Parliament that legal experts had advised him that parties comprising the national government did not have to submit written agreements to ensure the legitimacy of the said government.
He said this when the joint opposition questioned him on the validity of the national government in the House last evening.
However the speaker said he was prepared to look into the matter once again to determine whether the two parties in the national government had to fulfil other legal formalities.
JO parliamentary group leader Dinesh Gunawardene who raised this matter in the House said it was essential to submit the written agreement between the UPFA and the UNP to the House and recalled that Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe had also mentioned that there was an agreement between the parties.
JO MP Dallas Allhaperuma said the issue pertaining to the National government is a constitutional matter rather than political. He urged the Speaker to use the Right to Information Act and obtain a copy of the agreement.
JVP MP Nalinda Jayatissa said both parties should submit a copy of the agreement.
House Leader Lakshman Kiriella said there was no question about the national government as both Prime Minister Wickremesinghe and UPFA General Secretary Mahinda Amaraweera had confirmed that the national government was still in existence.

More tax concessions to State officials
	
The Ministry of Public Administration and Management has in a circular increased tax concessions for State officials, Provincial officials and Courts officials when importing vehicles.
Earlier, these officials were allowed to import vehicles under three categories.
Under the first category, they were allowed to import a vehicle valued at a maximum of US$45,000. Under the second and the third categories, officials have been allowed to import vehicles with a maximum value of US$40,000 and US$35,000 respectively.
However, under the 2018 Budget, separate tax concessions were granted to the three categories.
Accordingly, tax concessions of Rs.9 million, Rs.7.5 million and Rs.6 million were granted when importing a vehicle under the three categories respectively. This budget proposal was never implemented.
Against this backdrop, the latest circular was issued by the Public Administration Ministry following discussions with the state officials.
After obtaining Treasury consent, the amount of tax concessions recommended by the Budget proposal had been increased.
Based on the new circular,tax concessions of Rs.22 million, Rs.16 million and Rs 12 million would be granted to the three categories respectively when importing a vehicle. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

Newborn mortality rate in SL almost same as US
	
The newborn mortality rate in Sri Lanka which is 5.3 is almost same as that in Kuwait and the US, which is 4, a latest report released by the UNICEF said on Tuesday.
The report titled Every child alive: The urgent need to end newborn deaths said In Kuwait and the US, both high-income countries, the newborn mortality rate is 4. This is only slightly better than lower-middle-income countries such as Sri Lanka and Ukraine, where the newborn mortality rate is 5.
However, Sri Lankas rate is the most improved rate in the category of lower middle income countries. Indias newborn mortality rate is 25.4, Bangladeshs 20.1 and in Bhutan it is 18.1.
Children born in Pakistan face the worst odds as 46 out of every 1,000 babies born, die before the end of their first month. Babies born in Japan stand the best chance of surviving, with just 1 in 1,000 dying during the first 28 days, the report said.
Explaining about the differences and similarities of mortality rates among countries, the report said a countrys income level was not an indicator of the rate.
It said 2.6 million babies die before turning one month every year and another 2.6 million are stillborn.
Each of these deaths is a tragedy, especially because the vast majority are preventable. More than 80 per cent of newborn deaths are the result of premature birth, complications during labour, delivery and infections such as sepsis, meningitis and pneumonia. Similar causes, particularly complications during labour, account for a large share of stillbirths, it said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

Whenever the young people I happen to meet insist, by implication, that I speak with them in English, they are nervous, and not because I can speak the language well. (For the record, I stutter very badly.) Rather, its because they want to convince me, subconsciously, that they dont want me to condescend to them when I speak that language and because they assume that I am more conversant with it, when I am not. They are exceedingly polite, aloof, always smiling, and never wont to the casualness with which they greet one of their own kind. They speak wonderfully well, and some of them write very well, but they can never let go of that lack of confidence which often comes with the pain of understanding that they have been alienated from the language from their birth. The rest of the world has an advantage over them, but they ignore that; since they cant convince that world, they try to convince me.
Such first encounters leave me perturbed and the conversations that flow from these encounters and the many encounters I walk into later on leave me confused. Its a curious contradiction at the heart of the milieu from which these young people come  they happen to hail from the village, yet they are situated in the city, because of which they have to be as good as those around them  and it explains how we, and even those who teach us, treat English; with both respect and contempt. These youngsters love to write in that language, to speak it, but they also despise it for the gulf it opens up between them and the rest of the world. So much so that when they relapse to their own tongue  in my case and the case of the people I meet, Sinhala  they revert to the joviality that had eluded them in English. Sometimes I even sense strong undercurrents of contempt beneath their laughter whenever I stutter and stammer in my own language; they dont hate me for it, yet they picture me as the city-bred babe the same way those from the city picture them as unsophisticated bumpkins. Its a clash of civilisations, within a civilisation.
The Sinhala speaker, in such circumstances, treats the English speaker in much the same way that the English speaker treats the Sinhala speaker: in both cases its snobbery versus inability
Snobbery vs inability
The Sinhala speaker, in such circumstances, treats the English speaker in much the same way that the English speaker treats the Sinhala speaker: in both cases its snobbery versus inability. But because the English speaker in this country, like the English artist and critic and writer, is a minority, he is forced to be even more pronounced in his snobberies. I have been enthralled these past few years by various encounters with those who wield Sinhala and English so well that they put to shame anyone in the Sinhala or English cultural spheres who operate in one language to the exclusion of the other, but these encounters have been few and far in-between, because bilingualism in this country is fast disappearing. Thats why, I suppose, the way each cultural sphere treats and regards the other, even in otherwise ordinary and unexceptional conversations, fascinates me so much. Its an eternal battle of wit versus grit; the Sinhala speaker, like the poor child in many of our childrens movies, has the latter; the English speaker has the former. In other words, its intelligence versus ability, or book-smart versus street-smart.
Whenever an English play depicts a native speaker (Sinhalese, Tamil, or Sikh), it tends to depict him unflatteringly; hes so stupid that he can only act without using his mind, and is hence made out to be a mechanistic robot. Whenever a Sinhala play depicts an English language speaker it too depicts him unflatteringly, only this time he is more often than not bespectacled, is clad in suit and coat, and speaks pompously. This is true of other art forms too; in an episode of Bodima I saw when I was young, an English teacher who ostensibly refuses to speak in Sinhala does so when the most aggressive resident in the bodima tries to attack him over a misunderstanding. This attitude  that the pretenders among us, who project their snobbery by explicitly desisting from the vernacular, can be made to exit their snobbery by force  is refreshing because it has been made use of in interesting ways, and even parodied: towards the end of Giriraj Kaushalyas Sikuru Hathe, when our hero (Vijaya Nandasiri) is being chased by Suraj Mapa, he runs into a foreigner, who he derides for his clumsiness (Koheda pol booruwo yanne), and who returns that derision, unexpectedly, in his own language (Thamuse ne yako pol booruwa!). But when the English artist satirises the Sinhala speaker, the effects are ominous, very often sinister and insidious.
Stories we enjoyed
From an early age, the stories we learned and enjoyed the most ended in the triumph of strength and goodness. No matter how hard we tried to get out of these stories, they stayed with us as we graduated to other art forms; television, the theatre, and finally, the movies. The popular cinema plays on the hopes and expectations of popular audiences, so there this triumph of strength was squared with another motif; the triumph of the doer. We were more inclined to the stories of Twain and Stevenson. We loved, in other words, to see doers. Not because we hated to think, but because we wanted to act. Even the popular culture we grew up on accentuated this quality, and when the heroes we fawned on lost their strength, and had to resort to their intelligence, we revelled in seeing them use that intelligence to get out of whatever situation they were in. (Asterix and Obelix, when they ran out of their arishta, compelled this attitude; they were weak, yes, but they tided over their weakness by resorting to the most obvious plans and escapades.)
The triumph of the strong, even when the strong are put down by outside forces, is what characterises the Sinhala theatre and film; its the strong who is vindicated, not because they are physically strong, but because there is goodness within them. The thinkers are characterised as weaklings; they are doomed to be cast aside because they cant be anything more than submissive receptacles, that is, yes-men and cheerleaders, to the hero. Its not a class rift that we see being sustained in these works of art, to put it clearly, but a world in which the strong are good and the bad are defeated once their henchmen, and their sources of power, are exhausted. In the English cultural sphere, however, a different sensibility crops up; despite the intentions of the most sincere playwright, what eventually transpires is that the vernacular man (or woman) is put down as stupid and ignoble. Curiously enough, here too the strong man happens to be, like his counterpart in the Sinhala cultural sphere, the Sinhala speaker, only this time the strong one isnt vindicated, the weak one is; the bespectacled, naive babe from the Sinhala play is now turned into a champion, at the cost of the entire Sinhala-speaking demographic.
Whenever an English play depicts a native speaker (Sinhalese, Tamil, or Sikh), it tends to depict him unflatteringly; hes so stupid that he can only act without using his mind, and is hence made out to be a mechanistic robot
When the typical teenage dramatist/writer resorts to the comedic skit, political or otherwise, at a school function, Ive noticed that he tends to gravitate towards satire and poke fun at the symbols of modernity: the telephone, the mobile phone, the fax machine, Facebook. (One such play I happened to come across re-enacted a scene right out of Sakras abode  Sakra the God  where divine figures communicate with their agents in the human world through all those symbolic devices.) Its an attempt at getting us to laugh, and we laugh with these young idealists, because they are sincere and innocent about what theyre doing. They need an outlet to assert their convictions through the arts, and they do this by turning banality into hilarity. Its the kind of attitude that greets me whenever I betray my lack of knowledge of my culture in front of them: they grin, they comfort me by telling me whats right, but they laugh at me and I laugh with them. Sometimes I wish the English artiste would leave them alone, but no; that artiste always puts down these Sinhala speakers, not to make us laugh with them, but to make us laugh at them, rather crudely.

More than 800 personnel from the US Navy and other countries are involved in the mission, which began in response to a deadly tsunami that ravaged parts of the region in 2004.
This marks the second year Pacific Partnership will visit Sri Lanka.In October, the USS Nimitz and its strike group made a port call inColombo, becoming the first US aircraft carrier to do so in three decades.
This years Sri Lanka stop will be similar to 2017s mission, said Task Force 73 spokesman Lt. Cmdr. Arlo Abrahamson.

Pakistani ex-PM Nawaz Sharif banned from leading his party
	
Supreme Court of Pakistan has disqualified former prime minister Nawaz Sharif as head of his party, the BBC News yesterday reported.
Mr Sharif was ordered to step down as prime minister last year amid corruption allegations that he denies.
The court ruled that his earlier dismissal from office made him ineligible to lead the Pakistan Muslim LeagueNawaz (PML-N).
All decisions taken by Mr Sharif while head of the party were declared void, including nominations for candidates in Senate elections due in a fortnight.
"The Election Commission is directed to remove the name of Nawaz Sharif as president of PML-N from all official records," Chief Justice Saqib Nisar said.
"As a result, all steps taken, all orders passed by Nawaz Sharif are also declared to be as if they had never been taken."
The ruling is being seen as a blow to Mr Sharif who has consistently claimed he is the victim of a political conspiracy. He is currently on trial in an anti-corruption court following an inquiry into his family finances. A verdict is due next month.
The PML-N has a majority in the lower house and hoped to win control of the Senate in the forthcoming elections, which are scheduled to take place months before an expected general election.

Qatar Airways Takes Delivery of the Worlds First Airbus A350-1000
	
Qatar Airways today celebrated the delivery of the worlds first Airbus A350-1000 as the aircrafts global launch customer before an audience of international media at the Airbus Delivery Centre in Toulouse, France. It is the first Airbus aircraft to be fitted with Qatar Airways revolutionary Qsuite Business Class seat.
Qatar Airways Group Chief Executive, His Excellency Mr. Akbar Al Baker, hosted a press conference in Toulouse to mark the delivery of the spectacular state-of-the-art aircraft to Qatar Airways, in the presence of Airbus President and Chief Operating Officer, Mr. Fabrice Brgier; and President of Defense Aerospace Rolls-Royce, Mr. Chris Chorleton.
Qatars Minister of Finance and Chairman of Qatar Airways Group, His Excellency Mr. Ali Shareef Al Emadi, said: This is a very proud day for the State of Qatar, as Qatar AIrways becomes the global launch customer for the worlds most technologically advanced aircraft. The Airbus A350-1000 will be a wonderful addition to our national carriers fleet, allowing Qatar Airways to continue to set the highest standards of excellence and quality in the industry. Todays delivery is a testament to Qatar Airways commitment to continued expansion."
Qatar Airways Group Chief Executive, His Excellency Mr. Akbar Al Baker, said: Qatar Airways always demands the very best for its customers, so it is right that we are the first airline in the world to take delivery of the very first Airbus A350-1000. This remarkable state-of-the-art aircraft will be the first of 42 to be flown on our expanding global route network. It will become a firm part of the Qatar Airways fleet, making us the biggest operator in the world of this aircraft type and maintain our status as flying one of the youngest fleets in the sky, with an average age of just five years.
The Qatar Airways A350-1000 will keep us ahead of the curve and allows us to continue to offer our passengers the outstanding levels of comfort and style that they expect from Qatar Airways. And at 23 feet longer than the A350-900, it will also enable us to substantially increase our capacity on the routes on which we operate it, offering 46 Business Class seats in our award-winning and revolutionary Qsuite, and 281 extra-wide 18-inch seats in Economy Class.
Combine this with its cutting-edge light-weight carbon composite design, incredibly fuel-efficient Rolls-Royce Trent XWB-97 engines, the additional revenue benefits generated by the A350s lowest seat mile cost in its class, and its excellent reliability record, and you have an unbeatable aircraft on which we will offer our world-famous award-winning five-star service.
Airbus President and Chief Operating Officer, Mr. Fabrice Brgier, said: It is a huge source of pride for Airbus to deliver the very first A350-1000 to our launch customer Qatar Airways. Bringing major advantages in fuel and cost efficiency along with unmatched passenger comfort, the A350-1000 is the ideal aircraft to showcase Qatar Airways legendary customer service. With its greater capacity compared to the A350-900, the newest widebody will play a major role on the carriers busiest long-haul routes and will contribute to strengthen their position at the forefront of the aviation industry.
The A350-1000 is the latest member of the Airbus wide-body aircraft portfolio. As the global launch customer, Qatar Airways will be the first airline to fly the A350-1000, which will go into service on the Doha-London route this month. Qatar Airways operates six daily flights between Doha and London Heathrow Airport. The airline was also the global launch customer for the A350-900 in 2014, and now operates 21 in its fleet.
Compared to the A350-900, the A350-1000 features 44 extra seats, with a two-class cabin of 46 award-winning Qsuite Business Class seats in a 1-2-1 configuration, featuring 80-inch fully flat beds and 22-inch HD in-flight entertainment screens. This will include 46 suites, with the middle suites able to convert to six double beds, and six quad suites. Economy Class will contain 281 seats, each 18-inches wide in a 3-3-3 configuration, with up to a 32-inch pitch. Each individual seat will feature an 11.6-inch in-flight entertainment screen, and extra space at shoulder level for passengers in window seats, thanks to the near vertical side wall panels. It offers enhanced levels of passenger comfort, thanks to the lowest twin-engine noise level of any aircraft, advanced air conditioning technology and full LED mood lighting.
Two state-of-the-art higher thrust Rolls Royce Trent XWB-97 engines power Qatar Airways A350-1000, offering lower approach speeds. They were developed by Rolls Royce engineers with new technology in the engines core to provide a higher take-off thrust capability of 97,000lbs per engine, without compromising operating costs. As the worlds most efficient large aero engine, they save around $2.9 million per aircraft per year on fuel.
Like the A350-900, more than 70 per cent of the A350-1000s lightweight airframe is made from advanced materials combining composites (53 per cent), titanium and advanced aluminum alloys. The aircrafts carbon fibre reinforced plastic fuselage results in lower fuel burn, as well as easier maintenance. The A350-1000 also features a distinctive all-new, six-wheel main landing gear and four per cent larger wings
Qatar Airways operates a wide range of 118 Airbus passenger and cargo aircraft in its fleet of more than 200 aircraft. This includes nine Airbus A380s, 21 A350-900s, four A340-600s, 13 A330-300s, 13 A330-200s, seven A321-200s, 39 A320s and two A319LRs.
As well as being voted Skytrax Airline of the Year by travellers from around the world, Qatars national flag carrier also won a raft of other major awards at last years ceremony, including Best Airline in the Middle East, Worlds Best Business Class and Worlds Best First Class Airline Lounge.
Qatar Airways operates a modern fleet of more than 200 aircraft to a network of more than 150 key business and leisure destinations across Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Asia Pacific, North America and South America. The airline is launching a host of exciting new destinations planned for 2018, including Thessaloniki, Greece and Cardiff, U.K, to name just a few.

Soft loan package for middle income families
	
The government is introducing a soft loan package titled, Middle Income Housing Loan Scheme (MIHLS) with a maximum loan facility of Rs.5 million at a 7% interest rate payable in 25 years as a solution to the housing problems faced by middle income families among public servants and private sector employees.
The NIHLS was a 2018 budget proposal and Cabinet approval was granted to the scheme on Tuesday, Cabinet spokesman and Minister, Gayantha Karunatilaka said.
"The Cabinet Committee on Economic Management held on January 24 with regard to the implementation of the interest subsidy loan scheme through the National Savings Bank (NSB) approved this scheme to support first time home buyers in the middle income category to purchase a house from the middle income housing development projects implemented by the National Housing Development Authority (NHDA) and the Urban Development Authority (UDA)," the minister said.
"The NSB will release a maximum Rs.5 million soft loan with a repayment period of 25 years and at a interest rate of 7% for the first five years. Thereafter, the interest rate will be based on a floating rate on the market rate applicable to housing loans prevailing at the time."
The Minister said the NSB would handle 10,000 loans initially with the General Treasury and the NSB agreeing on an interest subsidy of 5%.
"The General Treasury will pay the interest subsidy to the National Savings Bank for the first five years. The interest subsidy calculations will be done based on the outstanding balances of the loans at the beginning of each month and the subsidy payments will be made on quarterly basis. A budgetary allocation of Rs.500 million has already been allocated for the payment of interest subsidy in 2018. The interest subsidy will be continued until the end of five years," he said.
The minister said the Director General of the Department of Development Finance of the Ministry of Finance and Mass Media would enter into relevant agreements with the NSB to implement this loan scheme. (Sandun A Jayasekera)

Sri Lanka Relations in Perspective History alive in both countries
	
Dr. Mohsen Eslami is Assistant Professor of the Department of International Relations, at the Tarbiat Modares University of Tehran. Recently he was invited for a round-table conference which was held by Pathfinder Foundation, in association with the Embassy of the Islamic Republic of Iran and in collaboration with the Strategic Council for Foreign Relations, on the theme Iran and the Indian Ocean in the 21st Century. In a brief interview with the Daily Mirror Dr. Eslami spoke about diplomatic relations between Iran and Sri Lanka. Excerpts:
The Iranian nuclear programme is peaceful. The USA and other allies have made a huge propaganda out of it
	Relationship between the two countries has progressed due to cultural ties
	We need to accelerate the cooperation in various fields like trade, education, culture and tourism
	We achieved this victory in this field(nuclear programme) through the local knowledge. We can share our knowledge with other countries
Q During the war in Sri Lanka Iran was the biggest donor to Sri Lanka at one point. Since then how has the relationship between Sri Lanka and
Iran progressed
The relationship between the two countries has progressed due to cultural ties. Trade has progressed. The two sides want to increase their cooperation, culturally, economically, and also politically. My opinion is that there is a need for more cooperation, more work from both sides. People in Sri Lanka love Iran and Iranians love Sri Lankans too. We associate Sri Lanka with tea which is so popular in Iran and also with the history of Sri Lanka in the ancient time. We need to accelerate the cooperation in various fields like trade, education, culture and tourism. Sri Lankans should come to Iran. This is my first time in Sri Lanka and its a beautiful country. Iranians can come here too.
Q Very recently there were agreements between Sri Lanka and Iran regarding health, economy, agriculture, trade and infrastructure. Why do you think that Iran has chosen Sri Lanka for these agreements
Sri Lanka is an Asian country. According to the neighbourhood policy we have to focus on our neighbours first. There are cultural ties and historical ties between the two countries too. Sri Lankans are kind and passionate. Thirty years ago the Sri Lankan Government gave thirty thousand tea saplings to the Iranian Government to be planted in the North of Iran as we Iranians love tea. We dont use coffee. We drink tea instead. This is also one of the aspects, where relations between Iran and Sri Lanka can be developed.
Q How does Iran benefit from this relationship
Iran wants to cooperate in trade and tourism. Iranian industrial corporations have come to build dams, and work in the energy and electricity sectors in Sri Lanka. We have projects here, but I think they are too few. There should be more because Iran in some aspects like dam building, electricity, oil, energy, and engineering have a lot of potential. We can come here and use these capacities to improve the infrastructure of Sri Lanka. Chabahar, one of the cities in the South most part of Iran is like Sri Lanka, but Sri Lanka is more beautiful. Because of that Iranians love this beautiful what they say natural, view in Sri Lanka.This is also one of the dimensions in which Iran should improve their relationship with Sri Lanka.

There should be more because Iran in some aspects like dam building, electricity, oil, energy, engineering have a lot of potential. We can come here and use these capacities to improve the infrastructure of Sri Lanka
Q There were economic sanctions against Iran sometime back. With these sanctions being lifted Sri Lanka now has the opportunity to directly deal with Iranian banks in trade. How do you see the way ahead in trade between the two countries
Since sanctions have been lifted and because of the agreement with the P5+1, relations between the two countries should ideally be improving. But the main problem has been bank operation. This is the key issue we face. My country has finalised the deal with Sri Lanka and we need banks to operate. We are waiting for banks to operate from the Sri Lankan side. Negotiations are going on now. We have to develop tourism, then the market, corporation industries, engineering etc.
Q In general, when a country donates aid to some development project should they assure that there will not be any impact on the environment before providing the aid Should they assess the feasibility of the project before providing the loan
We should do this. We study the project before the operation. There are international high level standards with which we are in keeping with. We also obey the laws and the regulations in relation to this. For example, in oil industries which are high tech. We want to come to Sri Lanka and form ties with the Sri Lankan government. For this, we have to focus on this regulation.
We cant do anything which harms the nature. We are a Muslim country and we believe that you cannot harm trees because trees are a creature of God. When somebody wants to make a house, for example, and if there is an old tree there, he has to pay a penalty to the Mayor to cut the tree. Or he should plant a tree in another garden. So, we cannot harm the environment. If you want to do something you must obey the rules and regulations of the environment. We have an Environment Impact, Environment Index and some other regulations. This is our procedure.
Q Iran also has a nuclear programme. How does Iran assure that the nuclear programme will not be misused when there is a conflict in their diplomatic relations
The Iranian nuclear programme is peaceful. The USA and other allies in the region have made a huge propaganda against Iran. But Iran adheres to the regulatory agency and the UN resolution. We also have a fatwa by our Supreme Leader that we will not produce nuclear bombs. According to the religion of Islam and the Sharia, it is haram or prohibited to produce nuclear bombs. We are waiting for the USA to make the operational decisions so that the issue of bank operations is resolved and financial transactions are normalized. We are very confident, despite boycotts and sanctions from the West. We are doing our best to improve Iran.
Thirty years ago the Sri Lankan Government gave thirty thousand tea saplings to the Iranian Government to be planted in the North of Iran as we Iranians love tea. We dont use coffee. We use tea. Tea is one of the aspects in which relations between Iran and Sri Lanka can be developed.
Q Is the nuclear programme just limited to Iran Or are there plans to expand it to other countries
This is for our country. We achieved this victory in this field through our local knowledge. We can share our knowledge with other countries which are interested in learning about it.
Q Do you see any other opportunities where diplomatic relationships between Sri Lanka and Iran can be expanded to
They can be expanded to the field of science because we have high ranking universities in Iran. Scholars can come here and share their knowledge in seminars and dialogues. Tourism is important as well. History is alive in both countries. Our people respect history and culture just as in Sri Lanka. So the two countries should pay attention to academia, trade, tourism, and culture.

Tabs after considering other priorities: Akila
	
Education Minster Akila Viraj Kariyawasam said today steps would be taken to provide Tabs to A/L students as planned after fulfilling other priorities in the education sector as stated by the President.
He told parliament that it was put on hold by the President after considering several factors such as using these funds for essential projects in the education sector.
The Minister said this in response to a question asked by joint opposition MP Dullas Allahapperuma that according to reports the President had stopped it because of problems in the tender procedure and whether it would be implemented in the future.
The Minister said they had adopted the correct tender procedure where they managed to save nearly Rs.2 billion when coming to the last stage of the programme.
"We adopted due procurement procedures to carry out this programme. Some people attempted to get involved in this project in undue ways with the help of powerful people. But we managed to select four suppliers and submit them to the Cabinet for approval," the minister said.
He said the President advised to postpone this project saying that there were other programmes in the education sector which should be given priority. (Ajith Siriwardana and Yohan Perera)

Thera gets patent for solar-powered vehicle
	
The chief incumbent of the International Meditation Centre at Rathmalkanda Aranyaya (hermitage) in Kitthalella, Bandarawela Ven. Madawala Upali Thera has received the patent license for his invention of solar-power operated motor vehicle.
A unique feature of this vehicle is that there is no emission of carbon dioxide and sulpher dioxide to the environment, thereby helping to minimise air pollution and reduce global warming, according to the thera.
This vehicle will be helpful to persons who have difficulty in walking as well as those who are looking for a cost efficient mode of transport that can get them from A to B. The vehicle, with a maximum speed of 30 kmph, can accommodate two passengers.
Before entering the Buddhist order the thera was a science teacher and while he is unlikely to abandon the order and leave the priesthood, he enjoys experimenting. (Palitha Ariyawansa)
