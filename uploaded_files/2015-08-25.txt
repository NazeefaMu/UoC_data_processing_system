?A dead man? turns up to cast his vote!
	
This one is a secretarial one of a key Ministry. He turned up at a polling station located in a city suburb. He handed his polling card to the clerk concerned and waited for the ballot paper.
The clerk who perused the electors? register looked up and announced: ?Sir, you can?t vote.?
?The bemused official asked: ?Why can?t I vote??
?According to this register you are dead. So you can?t vote.?
?If I am dead, how can I be present here to cast my vote,? the official asked again.
?Well, according to the register, you are dead. The dead can?t vote,? he said with finality.
A junior presiding officer who was listening to the argument intervened.
?Look up the other electors? register,? he told the clerk.
The clerk who went through the other register found the name of the official in it as that of an eligible elector.
The JPO gave his ruling: ?According to this register this gentleman is not dead. He has produced both his National Identity card and the polling card. So he is entitled to cast his vote.?
The official who looked highly amused was seen wearing a smile even when he was leaving the polling station.

Cake for not fighting over ?manape? goes to red comrades!
	
Counting of ?manape? votes saw much excitement and commotion marked by scuffles and arguments outside most counting centers.
At the Colombo Kachcheri, several red-faced candidates from both main parties called for recounts. Meanwhile, a scuffle broke out outside a counting centre in Kurunegala where the protagonist was a former Ministerial one. The scuffle continued until the arrival at the scene of security personnel from a special unit, they say.
A fair candidate at a counting centre in Sabaragamuwa had broken down in tears on hearing of her ?manape? result. Certain disappointed candidates also had tried to stage a sit-in opposite this counting centre as a mark of protest against the results announced.
Only comrades of the Bell party have won kudos from election observers for steering clear of ?manape? ? related untoward incidents, they say.

China to allow pension fund to invest in stocks
	
		 		 
		 
			
REUTERS: China will allow its huge state pension fund to invest in domestic stocks in the wake of a massive market sell-off, it was announced recently.
The fund will be able to invest up to 30 percent of its net assets in equities, according to final guidelines from the State Council (cabinet) quoted by the official Xinhua news agency.
The fund, to which workers must contribute, had 3.5 trillion yuan ($548 billion) in net assets at the end of 2014.
The move could allow the fund to invest billions of yuan into domestic equities after a stock market rout forced the government to take emergency support measures.
Xinhua depicted the decision as an attempt to boost returns as China struggles to care for its increasing elderly population.
But it acknowledged the recent decline in the nation?s stock markets.
Chinese shares have been highly volatile in recent months, plunging almost a third in a matter of weeks in June and early July, after having risen over 150 percent in the preceding year.
After the June collapse, Beijing intervened with a rescue package that included funding the state-backed China Securities Finance Corp. to buy stocks on behalf of the government.
Previously, the pension fund could only invest in treasury bonds and bank deposits. The new rules also allow the fund to invest in convertible bonds, futures and infrastructure projects.

Coca-Cola EPL suspended
	
	The Environmental Protection Licence (EPL) granted to the Coca-Cola beverage factory which is being blamed for oil leakage into the Kelani River has been temporarily suspended, Central Environmental Authority (CEA) Chairman Prof. Lal Dharmasiri said.
	?We have discussed this matter with the Coca-Cola Company and have instructed it to adhere to the conditions specified by the CEA if the suspension is to removed,? he said. ?We are more concerned about the contamination of the water sources which provide drinking water to the people and would take stern action against institutions which flout the regulations,? Mr. Dharmasiri said.
	He described the action taken after detecting the water in the Kelani River at Kaduwela and Biyagama had been contaminated as a result of releasing the oil mixed with water had been released by a soft drink manufacturing company in the area.
	A special meeting arranged on the instructions of the CEA chairman was attended by the officials of the Coca-Cola Company in Biyagama, the National Water Supply and Drainage Board (NWSDB), Biyagama Divisional Secretariat, Disaster Management Centre (DMC) and the Irrigation Department.

Don't blame me for NL appointments: Susil
	
	Former UPFA General Secretary Susil Premajayantha said yesterday he was not involved nor consulted when selecting the party's National List (NL) nominees for appointment to parliament.
	He said as such it was unfair for the UPFA's constituent parties or defeated UPFA members not appointed to parliament on the national list to critisise him.
	Mr. Premajayantha said the enjoining order preventing him from functioning as UPFA General Secretary issued on August 14 was still valid and that it was not fair to criticise him without knowing the real situation.
	?What the UPFA constituent parties should have done was not to blame me for their defeat but to do everything possible to have the enjoining order against me removed. Many of the constituent partners must realize that they would have not got this result if they had not contested on the UPFA ticket. I am disappointed to have been maliciously accused without the proper grounds for doing so,? he said.
	Mr. Premajayantha said he tried hard to keep the UPFA intact and unfortunately, the political parties which won seats are the ones criticising me without talking about the benefits they got by affiliating with the UPFA.
	He said the UPFA had not been faced by such problems in the past with regard to national list appointments but on this occasion the enjoining order the election results had led to unexpected difficulties cropping up.
	Meanwhile, National Freedom Front (NFF) leader Wimal Weerawansa has threatened legal action against Mr. Premajayantha for not nominating a NFF candidate to parliament from the UPFA national list. (Sandun A Jayasekera)

Fitch affirms Standard Chartered Bank, Sri Lanka branch at ?AAA(lka)?
	
		 		 
		 
			
Fitch Ratings Lanka has affirmed Standard Chartered Bank, Sri Lanka Branch?s (SCBSL) National Long-Term Rating at ?AAA(lka)?. The Outlook is Stable.
SCBSL?s rating is at the highest end of the National Rating scale and reflects the credit profile and financial strength of Standard Chartered Bank (SCB; AA-/Negative).?
SCB?s rating is higher than Sri Lanka?s Long-Term Local and Foreign Currency Issuer Default Ratings of ?BB-?, and as a result, SCBSL?s rating on the National Rating scale is mapped to ?AAA(lka)?.
The rating is linked to SCB?s IDR because of SCBSL?s legal status as a branch of SCB, making it a part of the same legal entity. Fitch believes that support from SCB would be forthcoming if required, subject to any regulatory constraints on remitting money into Sri Lanka.
Due to lack of credit growth mainly on the corporate segment, SCBSL?s loan book contracted 8 percent in 1Q15 similar to those recorded by other Fitch-rated foreign bank branches operating in Sri Lanka.?
The branch continues to provide working capital financing to its top-tier corporate clients while building its retail book, which accounted for 28 percent of the total loan book at end-2014 (end-2013: 26 percent).?
Fitch expects SCBSL to maintain steady asset quality relative to its peers given its exposure to top-tier clients. SCBSL?s reported gross non-performing loan ratio stood at 0.46 percent at end-1Q15, compared with 0.33 percent at end-2014.
SCBSL funds its operations largely through deposits (96 percent of total funding at end-1Q15), although the branch has access to intergroup funding, if needed. SCBSL?s Fitch Core Capital ratio remained high at 25.6 percent at end-1Q15 (end-2014: 24.2 percent) despite the repatriation of Rs.5.5 billion of profit in 2014 to its head office. The previous profit repatriation that took place in 2012 amounted to Rs.1.6 billion.
The branch is the second-largest among the Fitch-rated foreign bank branches in Sri Lanka, with an asset base of Rs.128 billion at end-1Q15. It accounted for 1.8 percent of total banking sector assets at end-1Q15.

Fitch assigns ratings to Sri Lanka?s HDFC Bank
	
		 		 
		 
			
Fitch Ratings has assigned Housing Development Finance Corporation Bank of Sri Lanka (HDFC Bank) a National Long-Term Rating of ?BBB(lka)? and a Stable Outlook.?
At the same time, Fitch has assigned HDFC Bank?s proposed senior debentures of up to Rs.4bn an expected National Long-Term Rating of ?BBB(lka)(EXP)? and outstanding senior secured debentures a National Long-Term Rating of ?BBB(lka)?.?
The proposed issuance, which will have tenors of five and 10 years and carry fixed and floating coupons, will be listed on the Colombo Stock Exchange. HDFC Bank expects to use the proceeds to reduce asset and liability maturity mismatches.
HDFC Bank?s rating reflects Fitch?s expectation that the bank would receive extraordinary support from the state, if needed, given that the state effectively holds 51 percent of the bank. It also reflects Fitch?s view of the bank?s quasi-policy role in supporting the state?s initiatives to develop more housing for low- and middle-income families. However, the potential for state support is lower than for larger state-owned banks in Sri Lanka due to HDFC Bank?s lower systemic importance.
The state holds most of its stake in HDFC Bank through the National Housing Development Authority, a state-owned corporation that is tasked with formulating and implementing the national housing policy. The rest of the stake is held through the Condominium Management Authority and the Urban Development Authority. The majority of board members represent state institutions.
Housing loans accounted for 91 percent of HDFC Bank?s total loans at 1H15. The bank has the authority to grant to members of the Employees Provident Fund (EPF) housing loans that are secured against EPF balances (34.5 percent of total loans at 1H15). HDFC Bank?s reported gross NPL ratio has been extremely high (20.88 percent at 1H15) due to non-payments on EPF-backed housing loans, which are often used by individuals to access the balances in their EPF accounts. The Central Bank of Sri Lanka annually reimburses the bank for the instalments of EPF-backed loans that are in arrears for over three months.
HDFC Bank?s capital ratios have been declining alongside the expansion in its assets. Regulatory capital ratios benefit from zero risk weights accorded to housing loans backed by EPF balances. HDFC Bank is required to meet a minimum capital requirement of Rs.5bn as a licensed specialised bank by 1 January 2016. The central bank has granted approval to extend the deadline to comply with the minimum capital requirement to 1 January 2018. Fitch believes that although the bank is likely to meet the first interim target of Rs. 3billion, an infusion may be needed in order to meet the Rs.5bn requirement as internal capital generation may not be sufficient.
Interest rate risk is significant for HDFC Bank, given the maturity mismatches between its assets and liabilities. Management is looking into regular issuance of medium- to long-term debentures as a means of reducing asset and liability maturity mismatches.
HDFC Bank was established as a building society in 1984. It was converted into a government corporation in 2000 and then into a regulated licensed specialised bank in 2003.

Sobitha Thera blasts move to form jumbo Cabinet
	
National Movement for Social Justice (NMSJ) Leader the Ven. Maduluwawe Sobitha Thera today severely criticized the move to appoint a large number of ministers for the purpose of accommodating a 'National Government'.
?Appointing a large number of ministers has become a joke and a farce. The Mahinda Rajapaksa government had appointed an unreasonable number of ministers. Nobody protested then. I am optimistic that President Maithripala Sirisena will not continue the mistakes committed by that regime,? he told Daily Mirror.
Sobitha Thera said that when considering this trend, it won't be a surprise if all 225 parliamentarians are appointed ministers.
He said the 19th Amendment had not specified the exact number of ministers in case of a ?National Government? and as such it had to be decided by the decision makers of both parties.
The Thera criticized the move to form a ?National Government? and warned that such a move might lead to a crisis between the legislature and the executive.
?Even the beginning of the new government is in a mess. Some of the SLFP parliamentarians are describing the recently signed MoU as a move towards the formation of national government and some of them who have opposed such an agreement had decided to sit in the Opposition while the JVP and the TNA have not so far supported the proposal. In such a scenario, how can it be called a national government,? the Thera said.
He said in the wake of the UNP winning the most number of seats in parliament Prime Minister and UNP Leader Ranil Wicremesinghe should have formed a UNP-led government by inviting those who were willing to work with his government and thus secure at least a simple majority.
The Thera said if the Prime Minister had done this then there would be no stalemate as what was happening now. (Piyumi Fonseka)

The election was over and the party secretaries were called upon to hand the National Lists of their respective parties to the Elections Commissioner.
By this time, the Compassionate One as the leader of the Betel leaf party had removed Betel leaf secretarial one from his post and appointed a professor in his place to function in an acting capacity.
This sudden development saw both former Secretarial one and the new appointee claiming the right to finalize the official Betel leaf National List and handing over it to the Elections Commissioner.
?The Betel leaf leaders who held an emergency council over the unexpected development pressed the deposed secretarial one, the original custodian of the List to seek legal redress. They also decided that they should go to the Supreme Court and not to any lower court.
The Betel leaf secretarial one? who was at the vanguard in the battle waged to bring the former strongman back to Diyawanna as the PM now appeared to have lost all his fighting spirit. He put his foot down saying he was not prepared to get involved in litigation over the issue.
?Instead of wasting time in courts, let us talk to the new big boss to reach a compromise solution. I think I can strike a deal to share the slots on the National List fifty-fifty,? he said.
And he did work out such a solution, they say.

Another intimate remarked: ?People will continue to look on you with the same respect whether you go back to Diyawanna or not.?
?When you are in politics, you get both respect and disrespect,? said the former strongman. ?But that?s immaterial in the present context.

M Power Capital celebrates one year in business
	
M Power Capital Limited (MPC), the Colombo-based corporate finance advisory and private equity group, is celebrating its first anniversary. ??
Located at Horton Place, M Power Capital was established by a group of experienced industry experts with operational specialisation in diverse fields.?
The team?s primary areas of specialisation include Banking and Investment Banking, Risk Management, Property Development, Civil Engineering and Construction, Telecommunications, Apparel Manufacturing, Gem and Lapidary Trade, Manufacturing and Retail Merchandising. The Company?s client portfolio ranges from Large and Medium sized corporates (including financial institutions and multinationals) to SMEs and HNW Investors. M Power?s key strengths are preparing client companies for disposal and then executing the transaction, advising buy-side investors (corporate and individual) on a potential acquisition until execution, corporate restructuring, project finance and arranging funding. MPC is also geared to manage IPOs and Private Placements.
Speaking on the creation of MPC, Chairman Anil Cooray stated, ?Financial markets in Sri Lanka have experienced unprecedented change over the past few years, particularly after the ending of the long civil war in 2009. This has created a number of new challenges for corporates across different industries.? He added that recent developments in capital markets, volatility in equity markets and the government?s development initiatives have created new avenues for foreign investment and a renewed focus on capital market activity, changing the financial landscape for business. ?
?Cooray further stated that, ?With access to experienced and qualified foreign professional partners, our team of investment bankers are fully geared to simplify what would normally appear to be a very complex or time-consuming transaction. We have the connections in the local market to get over various challenges and one overriding quality of our work is being completely open and transparent with our clients. In addition to this, we recognise that this is a small market and we really have to ensure strict confidentiality at all times, balancing this with a robust compliance structure.??
Recalling the first year in operation, which Cooray termed an eventful year for the Company, he said ?Using our broad experience across many industries, we were able to lay a solid foundation for future growth while also being actively involved in a few significant deals.? One of the key highlights was when Sarasavi Exports (Pvt) Limited, a supplier to major high street retailers in the United Kingdom, approached MPC for financial and transactional ?advice on the acquisition of Isabella (Pvt) Limited , a subsidiary of the DB Apparel Group, the ?market leader in branded intimate apparel and hosiery in Europe.?
?The Sarasavi-Isabella deal was indeed a good indicator of how much confidence clients were ready to place in us, taking into consideration our team?s collective experience,? he said. MPC managed the end to end transaction process including conducting the negotiations with Sun Capital Partners, one of the largest private equity firms in Europe and the parent company of the DB Apparel Group. This also allowed Sun Capital Partners to dispose of their stake in DB Apparel to Hanes Brands, which is a hosiery giant incorporated in the USA. MPC continues to provide finance advisory services, post-acquisition, to Isabella (Pvt) Limited.
?The future looks bright indeed, as the policies of the new government gives direction and strongly supports economic stability,? stated Cooray, adding, ?MPC looks forward to working with companies in Sri Lanka and Asia, focussing on creating optimum capital structures and ensuring sustainable revenue streams ? always with a long term relationship in mind.?

Sri Lanka?s rupee weakened to 134.10 to the US dollar after authorities dropped the intervention rate by 10 cents, dealers said yesterday.
There was heavy foreign selling in large cap stocks, brokers said, with the Colombo All Share Index down 153 points in the first three hours of trading.
John Keells Holdings, Commercial Bank, Dialog, among key companies targeted by the UNP led administration with retrospective tax were among the most hurt.
There is no active trading in Sri Lanka?s forex markets but authorities sell dollars for trade backed transactions if a bank cannot get dollars from customers, keeping the exchange rate peg at 134.10 to the US dollar.
Rs. 4.81 billion was injected to money markets yesterday, lower than the Rs.8.7 billion injected on Friday.
The Central Bank?s Treasury bills stock, which is a proxy for money printing rose Rs.87.5 billion from Rs. 84.7 billion a day earlier. Net excess liquidity rose to Rs.41 billion from Rs.30 billion a day earlier.
The rupee has come under pressure from rising credit demand from state and private borrowers and low interest rates, a problem Sri Lanka has suffered ever since the Central Bank was created in 1951.
On Monday August 31, the Central Bank is due to make a monetary policy announcement. Central Bank Governor Arjuna Mahendran was quoted as saying earlier, that rates may be cut after the elections in August. (Economynext)

	The swearing-in of the ministers of the new government that was scheduled for today has been postponed, for the second time, until Thursday (27). It is learnt that the Cabinet will comprise 51 ministers.
	The 19th Amendment to the Constitution restricts the Cabinet to 30 except in the case of a national government. In which case the number of Cabinet, State and Deputy Ministers can be increased with the approval of parliament so as to accommodate members from the other parties who will join in forming the national government. The Cabinet minister will include the Prime Minister and the President with selected subjects coming under their purview.
	The Ministers of Justice, Foreign Affairs and Rehabilitation were sworn in yesterday with 25 more to be sworn in during the next few days and the rest to be sworn in after parliament meets on September 1.
	It is learnt that last minute changes had been done to the subjects to be assigned to the ministers. The Power and Energy which was previously under the purview of Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka will be handled by a different minister this time. Kurunegala district MP Akila Viraj Kariyawasam will continue as Education Minister while Kakshman Kiriella, who was Plantation Minister will be assigned a different portfolio this time.
	Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and President Maitripala Sirisena will also hold Cabinet portfolios and barring them, 28 ministries will be assigned to the United National Party (UNP), 17 to the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) and the balance to other parties including the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress (SLMC).

The NIC, the great leveler!
	
His Worship called at the Campus polling booth on August 17 in the company of the Green party chief as on previous occasions to cast his vote.
The Green party chief and his wife who were ahead of him in the queue cast their votes and when his turn came His worship handed his identity card to the clerk concerned.
?Sorry, Sir, we can?t accept this identity card. You have to produce your national identity card for us to issue the ballot paper,? the clerk said handing back the card to His Worship.
?Don?t you know that I am the city mayor?? an exasperated mayor asked the clerk.
?We know that, Sir,? replied the clerk. ?But you have to produce the NIC or any other document valid under the law.?
It transpired that His Worship had produced the official card that identifies him as the city mayor.
His Worship did vote later after going back home and coming back with the precious NIC, they say.

The ploy backfired on him!
	
Stories about how certain candidates from both sides of the great divide had carried out game plans to promote their ?manape? at the expense of their party colleagues are galore these days.
Perhaps the most interesting story comes from Wayamba from where the former strongman entered the fray as the Betel leaf party?s prime ministerial hopeful.
The ?hero? of this story was a candidate who headed the ?Manape? List of the Betel leaf party at a different poll in the recent past. He knew that if he were to increase his ?manape? vote, he had to market himself as a follower of the former strongman, but he should not promote the latter in the process. The wise guy hit upon a canny game plan. He brought out a poster carrying a picture of smiling former strongman and his own ?manape? number prominently displayed below it. The trick backfired on the man when it dawned on the party supporters that he had purposely failed to display on the poster the ?manape? number of the former strongman while exploiting the latter?s picture for political mileage.

US to provide USD 1 M for resettlement in Sampur
	
The United States said today it would join with other international donors to provide one million US dollars to support resettlement efforts in Sampur as part of its continuing commitment to strengthen Sri Lanka?s peace and development.
The US Embassy said as President Maithripala Sirisena said last Saturday at a ceremony in Sampur, Trincomalee, Sri Lanka?s efforts had attracted support from the international community.
?The United States joined other international donors and will provide $1 million to support resettlement efforts in Sampur as part of its continuing commitment to strengthen Sri Lanka?s peace and development,? the release issued by the Embassy said.
??Our goal is to help Sri Lankans around the country overcome the effects of conflict and displacement, improve the lives of their families and communities, and live with dignity,? said U.S. Ambassador Atul Keshap. ?
?The first $100,000 would be managed by United States Agency for International Development (USAID) to provide newly-resettled communities with a range of services and means of support to meet their basic needs while another $900,000 was planned by the U.S. Embassy to build two schools in the Sampur region with facilities to support and house displaced families.
??This $1 million in aid is part of broader U.S. efforts to build schools, hospitals, markets, and other facilities for people in former conflict-affected communities. Other programs include helping provide job opportunities and entrepreneurship skills for people across Sri Lanka,? the release said.

Who is responsible for adding insult to his injury?
	
In a rare situation where the electorate got sharply polarized between the two main political parties, the Flame party too fared poorly at the recent polls.? But what had hurt the Field Marshal more was the denial of his right to vote at the last election as well.
The Compassionate One soon after taking office restored the civic rights of the persecuted war hero.? But his name is yet to be restored in the electors? register.
The Flame leader who had been busy with electioneering had discovered that he had not received the polling card only on the Election Day morning. He had immediately sent a written request to the Elections Commissioner through his lawyer to register his name as an elector to enable him to cast his vote before the curtain comes down on the polling. However, the EC had not been able to do the needful due to certain legal snags, they say.
By the way, the Field Marshal could not exercise his franchise at the 2010 Presidential poll too though he was the common opposition candidate. ?
