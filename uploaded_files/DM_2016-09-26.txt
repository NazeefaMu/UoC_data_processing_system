Arrest Wigneswaran: Gammanpila tells FCID
	
Opposition MP Udaya Gammanpila said today he was looking forward for the arrest of Northern Province Chief Minister C.V. Wigneswaran, who spearheaded a demonstration called Eluga Tamil (Let Tamils Rise) by violating the Public Property Act.
He accused the Chief Minister of misusing his letterhead and deploying employees and vehicles of the Council in the demonstration held on Saturday in Jaffna urging a federal solution to the national question among several other demands.
The demonstrators demanded an end to militarization and Sinhala colonization in the so-called Tamil homelands.
Mr. Gammanpila told a news conference held at the Pivithuru Hela Urumaya (PHU) office that for the first time, a Tamil separatist demonstration was held in the country with the backing of the State.
We are awaiting the arrest of Mr. Wigneswaran by the Financial Crimes Investigation Division (FCID) and hope he will be remanded without bail, he said.
Mr. Gammanpila said that it was a constitutional right of the people to settle in any part of Sri Lanka and it was unfortunate that Mr. Wigneswaran, a former Supreme Court Judge had forgotten this fact.
The Sinhala population in Colombo was 51 per cent in 1981 but today it is 28 per cent. Tamils and Muslims who were forced to leave the North because of the war, settled down in Colombo. No one, not even those recognized as Sinhalese extremists urged the Tamils or Muslims to leave. Sinhalese who left the North during the war should be given the opportunity to resettle there, he said.
Mr. Gammanpila accused the government of encouraging the Chief Minister and said the President and the Prime Minister should take the responsibility if any Sinhala Wigneswarans were born in the future. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

CV has no right to call for removal of Buddhist Temples: Ranjan
	
Northern Province Chief Minister C.V. Wigneswaran has no right to demand the removal of Buddhist temples from the North, State Minister Ranjan Ramanayake said today.
He told a media conference that there was no need to remove Buddhist temples because freedom of worship should be preserved in the North just like in other parts of the country.
There are Buddhist temples, Hindu Kovils, Churches and Mosques in the rest of the country where the people coexist peacefully and the situation should be the same in the North as well," the state minister said.Anyone could stage protests demanding parts of the country, but no matter what such demands will be of no use."
However, the state minister said some demands made by Mr Wigneswaran could be discussed with a view to arriving at a peaceful solution.
He said he agreed with one of the several demands made by Mr. Wigneswaran. This is about investigating some of the things that happened during the armed conflict.
Investigations should also be carried out on the alleged sale of video clips on the war to channel-4 by some soldiers, the recent incident where an army officer is alleged to have killed his wife and all the other acts of violence carried out under the guise of war," he said while pointing out that such incidents were an insult to genuine military officers such as Major General Denzil Kobbekaduwa, Wijaya Wimalaratne and Hasalaka Gamini.

FCID again seeks intl warrant on Udayanga
	
The FCID for the second timerequested Court to issue a warrant through Interpol for the arrest of former Sri Lankan ambassador to Russia, Udayanga Weeratunga in connection with the inquiry being conducted into the huge financial loss caused to the Government in the purchase of Ukraine-built MIG-27 aircraft in 2006.
In a report submitted to Court, the Foreign Ministry had informed that according to the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry, Mr. Weeratunga was not residing at the given address in Ukraine and as such the summons was not handed over to him.
On an earlier occasion, the Fort Magistrate dismissed the FCID's request to issue an international warrant on Mr. Weeratunga.
The Fort Magistrate noticed him to appear in court and directed that the summons be forwarded through the Foreign Ministry to his address in Ukraine.
FCID Chief Inspector Francis Nihal told court that Mr. Weerathunga was absconding so as to avoid being interrogated on this controversial deal.
He said the former ambassador had not returned his diplomatic passport to the Foreign Ministry but was known to have been travelling about illegally on a forged passport.
The Inspector said Mr. Weeratunga was recently seen in a photograph taken with former president Mahinda Rajapaksa and it was evident that he was disregarding court orders.
Colombo Fort Magistrate Lanka Jayaratne fixed September 30 to decide on the issuance of international warrant on Udayanga Weerathunga. (Shehan Chamika Silva)

## Title: Getting harassed by IMF: Ravi

Getting harassed by IMF: Ravi
	
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) appears to be hounding Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake in the wake of multiple blunders in attempting to pass the Value Added Tax (VAT) Bill, increasing the taxation rates in recent months.
We have another 55 days for the budget, and as the Finance Minister, I get harassed, by nobody else than the IMF, Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake told a recent forum in Colombo.
An IMF mission which was in the country last week said that not legislating the VAT Bill soon would threaten the continuation of the 3-year US$ 1.5 billion Extended Fund Facility which started this June and which Sri Lanka is depending on to correct its balance of payments issues.
The attempt to legislate the VAT rate increase through the Cabinet this June had resulted in the Joint Opposition filing a fundamental rights petition at the Supreme Court, which ruled that the VAT amendments were not constitutional, since they were not passed through parliament.
Karunanayake had then drafted another VAT Bill last month, which got cabinet approval this month to go to parliament. However, the Joint Opposition pointed out that the legislation was published through Government Gazette earlier than it was approved by the cabinet, which was also illegal.
The government had planned to increase VAT rates from 11 percent to 15 percent in order to shore up the budget deficit which had spun out of control to 7.4 percent of gross domestic product in 2015 due to unsustainable public sector wage increases, compared to a projected deficit of 4.4 percent.
The IMF funding, as well as further funding from other multilateral organizations such as the Asian Development Bank, are dependent on massive fiscal policy reforms the government has to fulfil within certain periods of time.
Karunanayake has recently been seen visiting all parts of the country collecting proposals for the upcoming budget from the people, and he was quoted saying that the new budget would be revolutionary.
However, past trends may be witnessed again, judging from the promises made by Karunanayake at recent forum to large businesses that protectionism and concessions would continue, despite the lack of fiscal space to enact them.
Sri Lankan budgets since independence had focused on giving election goodies instead of the required fiscal policy tightening, which, together with loose monetary policy had led the country to short cycles of boom and bust.
The IMF however noted that recent months had seen greater fiscal and monetary discipline in the country. This is possibly a side-effect of the appointment of Dr. Indrajit Coomaraswamy as the Central Bank Governor, who has acted pre-emptively to weigh down threats.
Meanwhile, the IMF too appeared to have acted pre-emptively, setting an appointment one hour earlier than they intended to show up, probably in order to account for the always late Karunanayake, who in this instance had arrived on time.
Karunanayake said that he had contemplated blowing off the meeting with the late IMF delegation, but decided on the contrary.
Im sorry I was late. Working to time is essential. They (IMF) were supposed to come at 10.30 in order to make me come on time, but they came at 11.15. So either I had to come late here or tell the IMF to go home, he said. (Chandeepa Wettasinghe)

IMF wants VAT bill in parliament soon
	
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) had asked the government to expedite the legislative process pertaining to Value Added Tax (VAT) amendments, and stressed that any delay in doing so could lead to the postponement of the disbursement of the second tranche of the US $ 1.5 billion three-year Extended Fund Facility (EFF) entered into with the government in June.
Making the parting remarks after concluding the first review of Sri Lankan governments economic programme that is being supported by the EFF, the Chief of the IMF staff team, Jaewoo Lee however said all quantitative targets through end June had been met by the government.
We want to see the VAT Amendment Bill to be submitted to Parliament. That will enable us to go to our board with good conscience (and say) that progress is (being) made.
If it does not happen in a timely manner, we might have to postpone the (next) review, Lee told the reporters on Friday. 
The disbursement of the US $ 1.5 billion would occur in 7 tranches of approximately US $ 160 million each, followed by semi-annual reviews. The first such disbursement was made in early June.
The EFF programme entered into saw the IMF prescribing a slew of fiscal reforms, the majority of which relating to enhancing government revenue through taxes.
Sri Lanka has one of the lowest tax revenue-to-GDP ratios in the region.
Meanwhile Eteri Kvintradze, the IMF Resident Representative for Sri Lanka and the Maldives said that the VAT would become one of the main revenue sources for the government in 2017. 
We expect the VAT to take full effect in 2017 and it will be one of the main revenue sources in the 2017 budget. So, we don't see VAT as a temporary measure. We see VAT as something that could support Sri Lankas revenue capacity, Kvintradze said.
The IMFs remarks on the VAT were contrary to the governments claims that the increase of the VAT to 15 percent was only a temporary measure.
Commenting on additional tax reforms that are expected from the forthcoming budget, Lee wanted the government to revise income tax structure perhaps in reference to either a higher income tax rate or an expansion of the tax net or both.
For the 2017 budget, we want the government to implement income tax reforms, which will rebalance the source of tax revenues, towards a larger share of direct tax revenues compared to indirect taxes. That will be a main component of the budget, he added.
Sri Lanka collects 80 percent of its tax revenue through indirect taxes and 20 percent through direct taxes. The Prime Minister promised to bring this tax revenue mix to 60:40 in November, last year. But later the government did exactly the opposite by raising indirect taxes.
While welcoming the Central Banks move to pre-emptively tighten the monetary policy to maintain inflation within the target stipulated by the IMF, the mission Chief asked the Monetary Board to, remain vigilant in monitoring inflation pressures and stand ready to tighten further should inflation or credit growth continue to rise.
The mission welcomes the effective tightening of fiscal and monetary policies that contributed to improving market confidence and easing pressures on external balances, Lee said in a statement.
Despite the headwinds and widespread uncertainties, Lee forecasted the Sri Lankan economy to grow at least by 5 percent in both 2016 and 2017, much slower than the 6.5 percent target of the government.
There have been some ups and downs but we still expect the growth rate to be around 5 percent this year and next year, he remarked.
The mission stayed in the country from September 13 to 23 holding discussions with various Sri Lankan authorities and these discussions will continue in October in Washington D.C. during the annual meetings of the IMF and World Bank.

Elections Commission Chairman Mahinda Deshapriya yesterday ruled out the possibility of conducting Local Government elections before the end of this year.
However, he said he could take steps for conducting it before April New Year, if the Government addressed legal shortcomings this year.
Mr. Deshapriya said the delimitation process had to be completed in addition to ironing out lacunas in the present Local Government law for the polls to be conducted.
The Government decided to redraw the boundaries of some electoral wards created during the previous rule.
A committee headed by senior civil servant Asoka Peiris was appointed for the task. The committee is expected to present the report on new delimitations by October 15. Initially, it was expected to be ready by August 15.
Once the report is out, the subject Minister has to announce the number of wards and members to be elected in a Gazette notification. This is a prerequisite for conducting the election, Mr. Deshapriya said.
Besides, he said there were serious lacunas in the present law, and those should be corrected by enacting a new law in Parliament.
If the legal ground is cleared, we can conduct the election within the first quarter of the next year, he said.
However, there is no possibility for the elections to be conducted this year. We need at least 90 days to conclude the election process after declaration. If it is declared even tomorrow, we cannot go for it this year.
Alongside, the GCE Ordinary Level Examinations will be conducted in December. It is impossible then for us to have the elections during the period, he said.
