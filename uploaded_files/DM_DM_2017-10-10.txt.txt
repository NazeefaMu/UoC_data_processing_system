Anti-SAITM protest teargassed
	
Police fired teargas and used water cannons to disperse the anti-SAITM protesters who were protesting at the Kollupitiya Junction a short while ago.
A court order was earlier issued by the Colombo Fort Magistrate against the protest march by the anti-SAITM groups, including the Inter University Students' Federation (IUSF).
The Court ordered the protesters to conduct the protest in a decent and polite manner without disrupting the general public and vandalizing public property.
It also ordered them not to enter the Presidential Secretariat Office by any means.
Meanwhile, at least 14 individuals who were injured in the incident have been admitted to the National Hospital, Colombo.
Hospital sources said two student monks, a journalist and a woman were among those hospitalised. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

Be cautious when dealing with China: US
	
Every country should be cautious when working with China due to Chinas lack of transparency in certain engagements, a top US Military Officer said yesterday.
Rear Admiral Donald D. Gabrielson of the US Navy expressed these views upon asking whether the US was concerned about Chinese presence in the region particularly in Sri Lanka.
He said they were concerned about the fact that why China was now trying to rearrange the very system from which they were already receiving benefits.
You have to work with them, we work with them or we welcome their presence, we welcome everything they are doing. They benefit as much, or maybe more than anyone else from the very system that they are now trying to rearrange. For the US, that's a little bit of a mystery, he told the Daily Mirror.
When it comes to initiatives like the One Belt One Road (OBOR), he said the US was challenged to understand what that's about, where is that going to go and who benefits from that. It is not clear to us, he said.
He said these questions were worth asking and exploring especially as we approach decisions for new kinds of deals and new kinds of opportunities.
Opportunities are important and you have to have them and you deserve to have them, your people deserve hope for the future and that requires investment and requires new things. But they also do not deserve to be shackled from their hopes for the future. We want to see Sri Lanka grow in prosperity for its own benefit, he said.
Admiral Gabrielson is in Colombo to attend the Galle Dialogue-2017. He is expected to take part as a mediator of a panel of experts to talk about maritime affairs during the International Conference. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

Let Herath continue as long as he enjoys: Hadlee
	
Sir Richard Hadlee, first Test cricketer to achieve 400 Test wickets, has advised the veteran Sri Lankan bowler Rangana Herath to continue playing as long as he enjoys the game.
Herath became the latest bowler to reach the 400 wickets mark at the age of 39 years in the first Test against Pakistan last week. Incidentally, Herath has broken the record of New Zealand all-rounder Hadlee, who was only marginally younger when he first grabbed the 400th Test wicket.
Speaking exclusively over phone, Sir Richard says: Age only becomes a barrier when you lose enjoyment in playing the game and when ones fitness challenges the body with injuries, aches and pains.
I had never thought about being the oldest player to capture 400 Test wickets. It never bothered me and I dont think of it being a record. It was the culmination of 18 years work. It was the pinnacle of my career. It was my Mount Everest and I was pleased to get to the top of the world at that point in my life. It was the February 4, 1990.
If ones performance is not up to standard, it is time to retire. I was 39 when I was confronted with those issues even though I got a wicket with my last ball and a five-wicket bag in my last game, he signed off.
Sir Richard finished his career with 431 Test wickets. (Gulf news)

## Title: Mahendran quizzed on EPF bidding

Mahendran quizzed on EPF bidding
	
Deputy Solicitor General (DSG) Milinda Gunatilleke during the cross examination of former Central Bank Governor Arjuna Mahendran yesterday expressed the view that the EPF could have gained much higher profits it had bid at the primary auctions (October 30, 2015 and January 28, 2016) at the same time as other primary dealers did without purchasing the same bonds at lower rates in the secondary market from those same primary dealers (mainly PTL) soon after the auction.
The cross-examination of Former Governor Arjuna Mahendran was continued yesterday by Senior State Counsel Shaida Barrie and Senior Deputy Solicitor General Milinda Gunatilleke on the considerations of the suspension of the Direct Placement Method and the Secondary Market Transactions of the EPF.
			Mahendran observed that the Direct Placement Method was used to control the interest rate previously between two parties with no existence of proper transparency and was of the view that in a market based economy the interest rate should not be controlled or the system would breakup
			
		At the Oct 30 auction Perpetual Treasuries Ltd had succeeded in a large amount of bids and subsequently within a few days in the next month (November) had sold them to the EPF in the secondary market through an intermediary (PABC)
		During the examination by Senior State Counsel Shaida Barrie, the witness observed that the Direct Placement Method was used to control the interest rate previously between two parties with no existence of proper transparency. The witness was of the view that in a market based economy the interest rate should not be controlled or the system would breakup.
The witness continued to describe to the Commission about the reasons which made him take the decision to suspend the Direct Placement Method and raise Government money through Public Auctions only.
However, summing up the questioning, Justice Prasanna Jayawardena questioned the witness.
Justice Prasanna Jayawardena: During the February 27, 2015 auction, the Government did have a huge appetite for borrowing, right
Witness Mahendran: Yes
Justice Jayawardena: You have seen the Public Auction system as reasonable to raise funds, right
Witness: Yes
J: In your view, was it prudent to make such a big change at that point to raise money
W: Yes. My humble submission is we didnt have any alternative.
Deputy Solicitor General Milinda Gunatilleke thereafter questioned the former Governor over the secondary market transactions relating to the EPF.
Referring to several documents pertaining to the auction held on October 30, 2015, DSG Gunatilleke explained that the EPF had not bid at the auction even though it had an excess of funds available on that particular day as per its cash flow statements.
However, on November 2, 6 and 9, 2015 the EPF had engaged in Secondary Market transactions and had bought some of the same bonds advertised by the CBSL at the October 30 auction at a lower yield rate.
In this auction Perpetual Treasuries Ltd had succeeded in a large amount of bids and subsequently within a few days in the next month (November) had sold them to the EPF in the secondary market through an intermediary (PABC).
Referring to a certain ISIN (International Securities Identification Number), DSG Gunatilleke showed the pattern in which the EPF had bought the same tenure bonds in the Secondary Market at a higher price (lower yield rate).
Sample of Secondary Market purchases of EPF
-EPF could have bought the bond at a dirty price of Rs. 105 at the auction (October 30, 2015) but did not bid despite possessing the available funds as per cash flow statements.
-EPF then bought the same bond at a higher dirty price (Rs. 110) on November 2, 2015 in the secondary market (from PTL through PABC).
-EPF again sold the same bond to another counter party (to PTL through PABC) on November 3 at a dirty price of Rs. 110.5 gaining a small capital gain.
-EPF finally again bought the same bond back on November 9 at a dirty price of Rs. 119 (from PTL through PABC).
DSG Gunatilleke: Do you know as to why EPF would have bought bonds from the PABC (intermediary) in the Secondary Market at a higher price without bidding for those bonds at the Primary Auction on October 30, 2015
Witness: I cant comment on that without referring to sufficient other data.
When Justice Jayawardena questioned the witness as to why in his view the EPF did not bid at the primary auction even though it had excess of funds as per the cash flow statements, the witness elaborated his observation, that the cash flow statements of the EPF could not be solely used to determine the decision taken by the EPF to not bid at the auction because there are other factors influential to its fund operation.
Therefore the witness said that he has to study it further to comment about the specific reason.
DSG Gunatilleke also referring to the auction held on January 28, 2016, explained another similar scenario in relation with the EPF bond trading in the secondary market.
The DSG said that EPF had not bid at the auction again (January 28, 2016) despite having the available excess of funds at that time as per the cash flow statements, but had bought some of the same bonds in the secondary market at a lower rate.
DSG Gunatilleke was of the view that the EPF could have gained much higher profits if it had bid at the primary auctions (October 30, 2015 and January 28, 2016) at the same time as other primary dealers, rather than purchasing the same bonds at lower rates in the secondary market from other primary dealers.
It was revealed that on both these occasions, in November, 2015 and January 2016, Mr. Indika Saman Kumara was the dealer who operated on behalf of the EPF. (Saman Kumara was subsequently interdicted following revelations made before the PCoI in July, 2017)
It was also revealed during the cross-examination that the EPFs dealing decisions had been sent to the Governor (Mahendran) at that time in a form of daily reports.
DSG Gunatilleke thereafter referred to the controversial February 27, 2015 auction and explained the EPFs and the other state institutions (SLIC, NSB and UGC) secondary market transactions pertaining to the bonds released at the February 27 auction.
The DSG said that on February 27, 2015 auction the advertised amount was only amounting to Rs. 1 billion. However, ultimately Rs. 10.05 billion was accepted.
DSG Gunatilleke said that the EPF and other state institutions had only bid considering the advertised amount.
However, later in June 2015, after a few moths from the controversial bond auction, some of the same long tenure bonds had been purchased by the state institutes (EPF, SLIC and NSB on behalf of UGC). That purchase was amounting to over Rs. 5 billion.
DSG Gunatilleke was of the view that if those state institutions (like EPF) had sufficient funds at the auction day they could have bought more bonds from the auction and meet the Rs. 10 billion requirement if the advertised amount was correct.
The PCoI comprising Justice K.T. Chitrasiri (Chairman), Justice Prasanna Jayawardena and K. Velupillai Kandasami will resume sittings at 10 am today. (Shehan Chamika Silva)

Pilibimbu 2017   Beyond the eye of  the beholder
	
I know very little about photography, the science or the art. What little I know I learnt from my father and certain texts written by people who werent practitioners in the field by any stretch of the imagination. Of the latter, Susan Sontags On Photography and, in part at least, Roland Barthes Camera Lucida captured my imagination. But these were largely on theory, and were no more and no less than two conceptions or two theses about an intriguing craft. Because of my childhood infatuation with Sontag (one which I never really grew out of), nevertheless, her take on the subject enflamed me. This is not about Sontag, Barthes, their books, or the state of photography in Sri Lanka, however.
Sontags claim that photography indicates our desire to capture, to collate, and to preserve for posterity is true when it comes to our relations with not just our friends and families but also our world. Its so potent, as a veritable symbol of conquest that is, that we refer to it as though it were a gun: we shoot, we go after, we capture. Her other claim, largely implied, that the world as such is divided into two cultures, between those who embrace the field and those who detest it, echoes that simplistic dichotomy between civilizations which are active, ruthless, go-getting, and civilizations which are passive, submissive, pacifist. We are divided even within ourselves: we like to shoot, but we dont like to be shot. In other words, we like to do, to take, but we dont like to be, to give.


Id like to think that Sri Lanka has moved away from the first and into the second of these cultures. The digital era has democratised our desire to preserve, to archive, and cameras have helped us preserve and archive our past, at least partially. Strangely enough, though, the world of photography in this country is limited largely to the birthday party, the graduation, the wedding. Children take to photography, yes, but for the most because of their own desire to be with others, to cohabit and intermingle and be a part of something they are invited to, and also to make money and see their work in the public domain. Commercial photography has never been more saturated here, before. School societies and clubs have a large say in this trend, naturally. This piece is about one such Club.
It all began in 1946 when a Photographic and Cinematographic Society was launched at Ananda College, Colombo. Initially it had delved into both photography and cinema (as the name implies), but for some reason the two had gone their separate ways, with the club morphing into what it is today. With no proper record or written history, unfortunately, it is difficult to chart its evolution. What we do know is that for over half a century, the Society and the school gave out some of Sri Lankas top-notch cameramen and directors, of whom the D. B. brothers (Nihalsinghe and Suranimala) stand out considerably. That it did served both the still and the moving image can be gleaned from the fact that Nihalsinghe wound up abandoning a career in Economics for the cinema.
On October 10, 11, and 12 (that is, today, tomorrow, and the day after), the Society will unveil its annual showcase event, Pilibimbu (loosely but not accurately translatable as Unveiling), on the first two dates as an Exhibition at the J. D. A. Gallery in Horton Place, Colombo 7, and on the third as a Day at the Kularatne Hall in Ananda. Not being a practitioner of photography by a long shot I can only hope, as I will, to sketch out what the boys involved in this endeavour have gone through and will bring out. To this end, I talked with the Presidents of the Club from the last three years: Kavindu Hasaranga (2017), Yashodha Liyanage (2016), and Avarjana Panditha (2015). Heres what they had to say and heres what we can expect, this week, from them.

Apparently Pilibimbu had been the sequel to a technical competition the Society had organised earlier this year, Oculus, held on May 19 at the Kularatne Hall. Oculus itself has a colourful history behind it, in fact. In 2001, we launched a magazine that doubled as an Exhibition


Apparently Pilibimbu had been the sequel to a technical competition the Society had organised earlier this year, Oculus, held on May 19 at the Kularatne Hall. Oculus itself has a colourful history behind it, in fact. In 2001, we launched a magazine that doubled as an Exhibition. Pilimbimbu, as it was called even back then, was the first competition of its kind organised by a school in Sri Lanka. However, it only delved into the artistic potential of those who took part in it. Photography is much more than an art. It involves physics and it involves technology. Thats why we organised Oculus 14 years later. The aim was to get participants through the mechanics of the subject through a series of tests and activities that gave way to a workshop attended by leading local photographers. Kavindu moved on to another topic here: how the subject is sustained at his school.
Being the current president he obviously had a great many things to say on the topic. And in what he had to say, I noticed one name cropping up frequently: the lecturer, and in more ways than one the guide and shaper of the Society, Boopathy Nalin Wickramage. I first came across the name through a teacher who had apparently been a friend of his at University. I remembered what this teacher told me: He is as bold as life, if not bolder. Now I am sure Boopathy will understand, that is if hes reading this, but for now Im more interested in how his students view him. I therefore asked all three at-one-point-presidents to explain how theyre taken through the subject theyve taken to, by him.
Apparently Boopathy is less a teacher or sir and more an aiya to them. Kavindu spoke first: We have lectures once a week. He takes us through everything, starting from how to hold a camera. In fact he offers us a virtual diploma in the subject, even though its not a professional qualification per se. By the time the aspiring photographer at our school completes Boopathys three-year course, hes qualified to strike out on his own. Yashodha interjected here: He is more than a teacher. As students, we are lucky to have him. Followed by Avarjana: He teaches less and guides more. He takes a different approach during each of those three years. He is a marvel to study under, to be honest.

What piques my interest when it comes to Boopathy and the way hes teaching these students is how careful he is when bringing art and science together with respect to his field. If theres just one thing I know about photography, its that, despite the democratisation drive its been steamrollered by in this very digital era, its the first art form which evolved out of physics. The cinema came later, and was an amalgamation of the still image (a heavily technical medium) and the theatre (the most primeval medium of them all, as I have pointed out before). While it does emphasise on the visual, the whats-seen and the whats-hidden-beneath, it also emphasises on the how-it is-taken and the how-best-it-can-be-taken, pertinent questions for any art form, I believe, and a point which Boopathy himself noted in an article written to the Ravaya and included in the Pilbimbu Souvenir of 2015, A Critique of the Art of Photography in Sri Lanka.
I therefore asked Yashodha and Avarjana to expound their views, fermented as they are, on this contentious matter. Yashodha answered first: You cant separate art from technology when it comes to this profession. Avarjana elaborated: Photography tests your ability to formalise the creative process. You may be able to envision the perfect shot, but if you cant handle your device, be it a DSLR or your iPhone, what your naked eye beholds will be lost. Forever. In other words, once you marginalise the mechanics of your craft, you lose the photographer in you. Reminds me of advertising, another for the most creative field where concentration is as important as imagination, and reminds me of what Sumitra Peries, another veteran in the cinema who followed photography early on and later moved into editing (shes the best visualiser our film industry has), once told me: Art is nothing less than the formalised expression of a felt experience.
Its a curse when you think about it, but modernity has all but completely separated the doers from the thinkers. As I pointed out in my article on Bhava and Harasara Pranamaya two weeks ago, this is probably the worst dichotomy our world operates on, reinforced by the lamentations and the nostalgia the past compels from us. Its difficult to think of lyricists who can compose as well as sing because there arent any. The counterargument to that, basically that is, is that such iconoclastic polyglots were hard to get even then, but the real argument here is that the past bred so many practitioners of a given field, who were acquainted with every facet to that field that their absence today is disheartening to say the least. This argument can obviously be extended to our photographers, today.


The aim was to get participants through the mechanics of the subject through a series of tests and activities that gave way to a workshop attended by leading local photographers
Its a nostalgic time right now, and photographs actively promote nostalgia, Sontag once wrote (On Photography). Times change and with them so do tastes, but nostalgia and sentimental value dont. In this digital age we can truly, sincerely, and madly ensure posterity for a photograph, if at all because digitalisation keeps it from deteriorating, from ageing, from mellowing. But that nostalgic value, be it with respect to a birthday party, a graduation wedding, or even a leopard at Yala, remains. Always. Thats one point the boys at the Society, at Ananda, with these three events and especially with Pilibimbu, have strived to bring out. Its a test of their success, or failure, whether they have succeeded on this point, and whether we take to it, today, tomorrow, and the day after.

## Title: Prisoners get a full day to  spend with loved ones

Prisoners get a full day to  spend with loved ones
	
We know life consists of both joy and sorrow. Our joy enhances when we spend time with our loved ones. Although it is so, everybody doesnt get that precious opportunity to be so close to his or her loved ones every day. Thats because either they are far away from their loved ones in terms of distance or where the hearts are concerned. If someone, whom you love the most, isnt close to you, you feel isolated or lonely.
Prisoners, who are branded as criminals, live a life of misery and anxiety. The focus of this story is on the prisoners who have been sentenced to death. They once made a grievous mistake in their lives, hence they were dragged into a wretched cell, a place where they have to live until their life ends. They surely regret what they have done, but their fate doesnt allow them to put their lives in order. If anybody can do something, which would at least give them relief or bring a smile to the faces of those inmates, thats indeed praiseworthy. 


We got to know of an event titled Family Gathering which was organized in the Welikada Prison with the special permission of Commissioner General of Prison Nishan Dansinghe and the acknowledgment of the Superintendent of the Welikada Prison Chandana Ekanayake. 
Ekanayake told the Daily Mirror that according to the prison law, life term prisoners get only a few minutes per month to meet with their family members, but despite such an opportunity, most family members dont use this time provided to them stating that this is insufficient. Therefore, a golden opportunity was given to 500 life term prisoners on September 10, to mark the Prisoners Day, so that family members could spend a day with prisoners and participate in a celebration.
Those who were very much rude and aggressive have now become really serene and polite as a result of the effective rehabilitation process in the Prison. It was really sensitive and pitiful to see how children were being fondled by their fathers and mothers, who have been sentenced to death. A tear came to my eye when I saw how they were sharing a meal with their loved ones, Ekanayake said.
A prosoners wife said that her husband had been in Welikada Prison for 18 years and she and her kids were delighted to have time with him. She added that she was absolutely thankful to the officials of the prison for organizing an event like this.
When my husband was imprisoned, the kids were too small, but now when he looked at them, they have grown up well. He told me that he was unfortunate not to see how his kids grow up. My two kids have told me that they would not get married until their father is released. I hope my husband would return after being released one day and continue the same life we had before, she said.
It is actually heartbreaking to hear such a statement from a courageous wife who really fathoms the reality of life.
The superintendent said that he was rather astonished by the way mothers, fathers, children and other relatives approached inmates without hating or mocking at them.
It was lovely to see how one prisoner was resting his head on his mothers lap. This scene just underscored how much a mother loves a son. 
She told that she had done all the hard work to bring up her son after the demise of her husband. However she said, while sobbing, that she could not prevent him from ending up where he is today.
We are extremely destitute sir. My husband was killed by his enemies when my son was an infant. Thereafter, I had to bear up all the sufferings and live with my son. One day when he came to know the slayers of his father, he wanted to take revenge on them in the same manner in which his father was slain. Then, he ended up behind bars, the mother related a shocking story.
She said that she hoped her son would return to her before she would close her eyes. She said that this was her last wish.
Although death is inevitable, events like these can be prevented if we use our brains. What matters is patience and courage. We have to be wise when taking certain decisions in our lives. Otherwise we will have to face similar situations like these, Ekanayake said.
There was a Ukraine woman who has been sentenced to death. Family members and her Sri Lankan friends had come to visit her. It was obvious that her friends and own family members from Ukraine have not abandoned her. Thats wonderful.

A woman was seen embracing her son. Her melancholic face revealed the agony she was experiencing. 
The woman asked, Does father take care for you my son.

The son said, Yes. He is the one who gave me money to see you. Thats how I bought food for you.
The woman said, Does father come to see me son.

The son said, My step-mother doesnt allow father to see you although he wishes to. 
The woman said, That doesnt matter. Tell father that I am not at enmity with him. Have a good life with your father and step-mother. Theruwan Saranai. 
That was a dialogue between a son and his mother, who is in jail for life. There is no need to exaggerate on the life she is living in prison. We heard that she was cursing herself saying that she is a sinner. Then we also noticed how her son consoled her by saying I will never desert and forget you. You are my angel.

This writer feels that readers must be thinking of how unfortunate they (Prisoners) are to come to such a depressing state. Nevertheless, we noticed that the family members of those inmates didnt utter a single word which would discourage or afflict them. It is noteworthy that the love and affection of parents, wives, husbands and children of these inmates towards them have remained unchanged.

When my husband was imprisoned, the kids were too small, but now when he looked at them, they have grown up well. He told me that he was unfortunate not to see how his kids grow up

THE WILD ELEPHANT:  an Icon of Tourism  in Sri Lanka
	
Wildlife and Nature Protection Society Monthly Lecture  October 2017
Sri Lanka is one of the few countries where a large number of elephants can still be seen in the wild. There are some who estimate this number at being in the region of 6,000 - 6,500; by far the highest density per area of any Nation in Asia. 
From ancient times, elephants have played an important role in the religion and culture of Sri Lanka. The elephant is featured in many Buddhist stories and texts, while ancient kings used tamed elephants for war, ceremonies and work. 
Even today, the annual Kandy Perahera, the grand pageant in the hill Capital, with all of its gaily caparisoned elephants, is an important feature in the tourist calendar. 
In addition to this, Sri Lanka is the lone country on Earth where one can see both the largest mammals in the world - one terrestrial and the other marine - elephant and the whale!
With peace returning to the country, Sri Lanka is beginning to see an influx of a large number of tourists seeking a more wholesome experience. The recently launched 2025 Vision document talks of developing world-class management of Sri Lankas natural and cultural assets. Hence with elephants playing such a major role in Sri Lankas natural asset portfolio, could we not position the elephant as an icon for Sri Lanka Tourism
The Wildlife and Nature Protection Societys Monthly Lecture will take place on October 19 at 6.00 pm at the Cinema Hall, BMICH, Bauddhaloka Mawatha, Colombo 7.
Admission free entrance is open to all members and non-members.
Who is the better person to present this argument than Srilal Miththapala A former President of the Tourist Hotels Association of Sri Lanka (THASL) and former CEO of Serendib Leisure Management Ltd., he is a keen environmentalist and wildlife enthusiast with a particular interest in elephants. Unafraid to challenge the authorities on their failure to maximize on the biodiversity and other natural attractions that Sri Lanka has to offer, Miththapala has long been an advocate for branding Sri Lankas wildlife and presenting it in such a manner that it will encourage tourists to return to this country again to enjoy its beautiful wild heritage. Apart from the aesthetic and ethical reasons for wildlife conservation, he has also studied and quantified the enormous financial benefits that wild animals, particularly wild elephants generate annually in earning foreign exchange for this country.

Sri Lanka is the lone country on Earth where one can see both; the largest mammals in the world - one terrestrial and the other marine - elephant and the whale!

## Title: Will inform IMF, WB that Rs.792 bn unused: Bandula

Will inform IMF, WB that Rs.792 bn unused: Bandula
	
The joint opposition said today it would inform the World Bank (WB), the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the Asian Development Bank (ADB) next week about funds amounting to Rs.792 billion remaining unused from the 2016 Budgetary allocations.
JO MP Bandula Gunawardena said Rs.3,898 billion was allocated through the 2016 Appropriation Bill, but only Rs.3106 billion had been spent during that year.
A staggering Rs.792 billion has been left untouched. This is 20 per cent of the total amount allocated for 2016. When such a huge amount is left untouched, it means the amount of funds available for circulation will be drastically reduced. This leads to a striking disparity in the income of the people with little or no money to spend on essentials, he told a news briefing.
The MP said the government could have built 30 more airports like Mattala or 80 more towers like the Lotus Tower with the unused funds if put to proper use.
The MP who is a member of the Committee on Public Finance, said the unused funds were revealed in a report he had requested from the Auditor Generals Department on the 2016 Budget expenditure.
None of the previous governments had used the entire amount allocated through a budget. But it is unusual to have as much as Rs.792 billion unused. If the IMF and the WB know about this, they would launch a separate investigation, he said.
The MP said former finance minister Ravi Karunanayake was responsible for the economic crisis in the country and said he had manipulated numbers to mislead Parliament in 2015, 2016 and 2017. (Lahiru Pothmulla)
