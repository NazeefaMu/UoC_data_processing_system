No direct involvement by Mahendran-Committee
	
The committee of eminent lawyers which inquired into the 30-year Treasury Bond issuance has said that?Central Bank Governor Arjuna Mahendran?had no direct role in deciding to accept bids over and above the one billion rupees stipulated in the 30-year bond tender and accept up to 10 billion rupees.Press release issued by the Ministry of Policy Planning and Economic Affairs
The committee of eminent lawyers which inquired into the 30-year Treasury Bond issuance has made far reaching recommendations to ensure transparency and better governance at the Central Bank.
The three-member Committee had interviewed a large number of individuals, including the governor, officials from the Central Bank, primary dealers and Perpetual Treasuries.
Several deficiencies In the bank?s Public Debt Department (PDD) which handles all matters relating to servicing the domestic and foreign debt of the government of Sri Lanka was observed by the Committee.
?Since the PDD is dealing with the most sensitive information of the government, the committee is of the opinion that a proper supervisory and monitoring mechanism has to be immediately implemented with regard to its activities, ?the committee said in its 19-page report.
However, the committee found That Governor Arjuna Mahendran had no direct role in deciding to accept bids over and above the one billion rupees stipulated in the 30-year bond tender and accept up to 10 billion rupees. The PDD had projected the government?s funding requirement as at 2nd March 2015 at 13.55 billion rupees.
?Even though the minutes of the Monetary Board number 4/2015 specifies to issue a 30-year treasury bond, the amount of the bond has not been decided by the Monetary Board (of which the governor is the chairman).
?This exercise is vested with the PDD as per the Operational Manual of the PDD. The decision to accept the excess amount has been taken by the Tender Board Committee that comprises eight members.
?The governor of Central Bank of Sri Lanka is not a member of the Tender Board Committee.?
The Committee concluded that there was no evidence to the effect that the governor had direct participation with regard to the activities of the PDD and the Tender Board Committee,
However, the Committee noted serious lapses on the part of the Bank of Ceylon (BOC) through whom Perpetual Treasuries had routed an unusually large amount of bids for the 30-year bond.
The Committee observed that the bidding pattern of Perpetual Treasuries was unusual and warranted a further investigation.
?It noted that the Bank of Ceylon should also carry out a forensic audit and seek explanations from its Chief Dealer and others on ad-hoc decisions risking a large amount of BOC funds involved in the 30- year bond transaction.
The three-member Committee that looked into the 30-year bond issue consisted:

Video: Give priority to 19A: Sobitha Thera tells MPs
	
It is ideal if we can simultaneously abolish the executive presidency and adopt a new electoral system but at the moment we should prioritise the enactment of 19th Amendment, National Movement for Social Justice Leader Ven.Maduluwawe SobithaThera said today.
?
He told a joint media conference all so attended by the People?s Movement for Noble Governance, an organization led by some members of the Catholic clergy that it would have beenwonderful if both these could be done together, but President Maithripala Sirisena never pledged to reform the executive presidency and the electoral system together.
?
Ven.Sobitha Thera said it would be better and timely to enact the 19th Amendment to the Constitution this week as planned and pointed out that the people would be greatly disappointed if the available opportunity was not made use.
?To delay enacting this vital piece of legislation will be a dangerous move because it willallow the incumbent president to use his executive powers while we will be in more troubleif the former president decides to contest the elections again,? he warned.
?
The Thera said the 19th Amendment could be a temporary measure while a new constitution was prepared by converting the Parliament into a constitutional council after the general election.
He said there was no need for a snap election because the present Parliament could continue till April 2016.
The Thera said the decision to dissolve the House after April 23 was taken so that MPs could enjoy their pension benefits and underscored the fact that the MPs could enact the 19th Amendment and enjoy their pensions as well.
?You can enjoy your pension benefitsbut fulfilthe aspirations of the people first,? he told the MPs. (Yohan Perera and Sanath Desmond)
