Allianz Introduces Sri Lanka?s 1st 3D Motor Accident Assessment App
	
Allianz Lanka announced the launch of Allianz 3D ? Solera App, a revolutionary, mobile-based, assessment application that is set to transform Sri Lanka?s motor insurance landscape.
Rewriting the rules of accident damage assessment, the Allianz 3D ? Solera App enables policyholders to carry out vehicle inspections by themselves in the unfortunate event of an accident. They simply need to photograph their vehicle using the app, mark the damaged area in its 3D garage and share the images with Allianz.
Having completed this simple, 3 step process, they can immediately move the vehicle from the spot and continue with their day to day lives. Thus, it eliminates the need to wait for assessors to visit the accident site to evaluate the damage.
Reviewing the images received, Allianz Lanka?s engineers assess the damage, compute the settlement amount and send an SMS update to the policyholder within 1 business day. The claims team then gets in touch with the policyholder on the following day to get additional details and check if he / she is okay with the offered amount. Once an agreement has been reached, the funds are transferred to the policyholder?s bank account on the next working day.
Thus, the Allianz 3D ? Solera App helps policyholders save a considerable amount of time and effort. Streamlining the entire claims process, right from accident reporting to claims settlement, it has also made it completely paperless.
?At Allianz, we continue to harness the power of technology to offer greater convenience to our customers around the world. In line with this, we are delighted to dedicate the Allianz 3D ? Solera assessment mobile application to our customers in Sri Lanka,? Mrs. Surekha Alles, Managing Director, Allianz Insurance Lanka. ?Doing away with the hassle of having to wait for assessors to visit the accident site, the app will enable policyholders to carry out their own vehicle inspections. We look forward to seeing policyholders avail the convenience offered by the app and its simple, 3 step, self-inspection process.?
Allianz Lanka policyholders can download and install the Allianz 3D ? Solera app for free directly from the Apple App Store and the Google Play Store or from Allianz Lanka?s website. They can also download it through the SMS notification they receive at the time of making a claim with Allianz?s call center. The insurer is initially piloting this service between 6a.m. to 6p.m., 7 days a week, to private motorcar owners alone.
Allianz Insurance Lanka Ltd. and Allianz Life Insurance Lanka Ltd., known together as Allianz Lanka, are fully-owned subsidiaries of Allianz SE, Germany, a world leader in integrated financial services. Having started out as a Greenfield operation in 2005, it has emerged as one of the fastest growing insurance service providers in Sri Lanka.

An Aeroplane named  ? The Jaffna ?
	
?
The two-seater biplane called ?The Jaffna? was used as a fighter and a bomber where the gunner threw bombs aimed at targets below
	The Jaffna Tamil community of Malaya, extended their generosity to the British Government by collecting money to pay for a fighter aeroplane.?The cost was a tidy sum of 2,250 Sterling Pounds
?
Some years ago, I was writing a book for the Civil Aviation Authority of Sri Lanka. They were commemorating 100 years of aviation in our skies. I was collecting information from every possible source, from people who remembered and from people who had heard stories of yesteryear connected to Ceylon. That?s when I came to know of ?The Jaffna? which sure has its own fascinating story.? ?
The year was 1915. A group of Jaffna Tamil people who had migrated to Malaya, played the lead role to relate an unusual tale about a British Royal Flying Corps (R.F.C.) fighter plane bearing a Sri Lankan name.? ?
Native people of countries conquered by the British Empire were called to serve in the war against Germany. Many joined and witnessed action both on land and sea. Efforts were also made to collect funds for the military treasury. Special requests were sent out to colonial communities to sponsor the cost of aeroplanes.? ?
The Jaffna Tamil community of Malaya, extended their generosity to the British Government by collecting money to pay for a fighter aeroplane. The cost was a tidy sum of 2,250 Sterling Pounds.? ?
Having the choice to name the plane they gifted to the war effort, the Tamil community in Malaya chose to call it ?The Jaffna.? It was in remembrance of a birthplace in a far-away land, of which their heartstrings may have often resonated nostalgic bells.? ?
The gift was made on the 22nd of December 1915.? ?
The aeroplane, so paid for, was a F.E. 2b (original design by Geoffrey de Havilland) which was fitted with a 120 HP Beardmore engine. The Jaffna was a two-seater which could carry a pilot and a gunner. It was known as a ?pusher? with the prop being fixed behind the occupants. This arrangement made the front vision great and gave the machine gun mounted in the fore nacelle wide angles of maneuverability. In this era, only the German Luftstreitkrafte operated Anthony Fokker?s invention of firing through a rotating propeller. The two-seater biplane called ?The Jaffna? was used as a fighter and a bomber where the gunner threw bombs aimed at targets below.? ?
These aeroplanes flew against the famed squadron of German ace Max Immelman. ?The Jaffna? too flew in that same sky.? ?
As the world got older and aviation flourished in Sri Lanka, the locally registered aeroplanes in commercial service were named after prominent royalty and renowned cities: King Vijaya, Viharamaha Devi, City of Anuradhapura, City of Colombo, etc. All of these, plus a host of others, flew the skies, brandishing their Sri Lankan heritage with boldly-painted names. But the first gift to the sky was the little fighter plane ?The Jaffna,? certainly lesser-known, but very much in the annals of aviation. It did fly in some war-torn sky, in formation or in dogfight. Then she went into oblivion leaving me to do the reminiscence.? ?
What I wrote is the truth as I know it. In Melbourne, in Point Cook Air Force Museum, there is a replica of this aeroplane. I don?t think the Point Cook people know about ?The Jaffna.? I wish more light is shed by people who may know of this story. I am sure it is even possible to trace which squadron was home to this aeroplane.? ?

## Title: Ariyawansa and the  dewdrops of poetry

Ariyawansa and the  dewdrops of poetry
	
?Pinibara Malak?, recognised as the Best Lyrics Collection at the State Literary Awards last year, contains 103 songs written by Kularatne Ariyawansa. ?Pinibara Malak? is a reference to the title of a song which brought Ariyawansa and Victor Ratnayake together, and it contains the following exquisite lines:? ?
<U+0DC3><U+0DD2><U+0DAF><U+0DCF><U+0DAF><U+0DD2><U+0DBA><U+0DDA> <U+0DB1><U+0DB4><U+0DD4><U+0DBB><U+0DD4> <U+0DC3><U+0DAD><U+0DD4><U+0DB1><U+0DCA>
<U+0DBB><U+0DD4><U+0DC0><U+0DA7> <U+0DB1><U+0DD4><U+0DB6><U+0DDA> <U+0DC0><U+0DC3><U+0D9C> <U+0DC0><U+0DD9><U+0DBD><U+0DCF>
<U+0DB1><U+0DDC><U+0DBA><U+0DD9><U+0D9A> <U+0DC0><U+0DD9><U+0DC3><U+0DD2><U+0DB1><U+0DCA> <U+0DB1><U+0DD4><U+0DB9>
<U+0DB6><U+0DD2><U+0DBD><U+0DD2><U+0D9C><U+0DB1><U+0DCA><U+0DB1><U+0DA7> <U+0DC3><U+0DD0><U+0DBB><U+0DC3><U+0DD9><U+0DC0><U+0DD2><U+200B>? ?
The tender feelings the narrator of these lines puts out, in the name of the woman he loves, is tempered by his fears that some inscrutable force will enrapture her and thus take her away from him. Ariyawansa?s songs in this sense are, like the songs of Ajantha Ranasinghe, about lovers who feel unfulfilled, with the caveat that Ranasinghe?s lovers can only hope for the day that they will meet those they wrote about, and idealised, in their poetry, while Ariyawansa?s lovers, while encountering and being with those they croon about, are fearful, if not nervous and tense, about the possibility of separation. Consequently, they pour out their feelings in gushes and torrents, as if to keep their lovers by their side.? ?
In Ajantha Ranasinghe?s lyrics (?Mage Lowata Oba Wadina Thura?) there is almost always a rift between hope and deep infatuation on the one hand and sorrow at the lack of fulfilment on the other. In Kularatne Ariyawansa?s lyrics (?Mata Mulu Lovama Obayi?) though, there?s no sorrow, only repressed fear, if at all, and joyous excitement. If it?s difficult to choose between these two men it?s not because they were the only lyricists who worked during their time, or the only lyricists at that time who mattered, but because they taught us about love, in poem and song after poem and song, and its many facets, from two different angles, both of which appealed to us when we encountered those we cherished. Personally speaking, I have both loved and lost. Ranasinghe?s lyrics thus tend to excite and then sadden me, while Kularatne?s lyrics tend to embolden me.? ?
Ariyawansa?s biography has been sketched out elsewhere, but never completely and recently. Perhaps a brief sketch might help us get to know him.? ?
?
Kularatne Ariyawansa was born in the Southern village of Benthara.?
A brief bio?
Kularatne Ariyawansa was born in the Southern village of Benthara. His family was domiciled in Colombo, so after he finished his O Levels at the game iskole, he was admitted to Ananda College for his A Levels. Ananda, at that time, was chock-a-block with artists who dabbled in everything and anything to do with the arts ? drawing, drama, cinema, literature, and of course poetry ? and soon enough he fell under the influence of two shapers of his destiny: Premakeerthi de Alwis and A. D. Ranjith Kumara. The one was a poet, the other a cineaste. It would be through the latter that he would be initiated into the music industry.? ?
I asked him to name his primary influences at this point in his life. He readily obliged: ?After I shifted to Ananda, I turned from poetry, the sivpada and the nisadas in vogue at the time, to the three minute sarala geeya. In that sense I was very much influenced by Chandrarathne Manawasinghe, Madawala Ratnayake, Mahagama Sekara, and Karunaratne Abeysekara, and in that order. It was through the vocalist who collaborated the most with these lyricists, Amaradeva, that I realised how the three minute song derived from our poetic tradition. Basically, the sarala gee was a combination of that tradition and the modernist revolution we were seeing in our cultural sphere. Whenever I listened to a song, I remembered this and made it a point to write down and study its lyrics.?? ?
?
Kularatne?s name has passed by, unnoticed, because of the inscrutable way in which these films were ignored in later years (a fate that Ajantha Ranasinghe did not meet), which is why I think his anthology matters
Like-minded artistes?
Ranjith Kumara had by this time got young Kularatne hooked up with a group of like-minded artistes and would-be artists, through a magazine edited at Ananda titled ?Sevana? and later through Arthur Amarasena?s ?Visithuru.? Because of the latter tabloid, he got to meet several poets and lyricists, and those encounters helped him get into various radio programs, including ?Saraswathi Mandapaya? and ?Yowun Samajayaya.? Through these programs, he met Abeywardena Balasooriya (back then a newcomer) and Sarath Dassanayake, with whom he teamed up to write his first song, ?Adarayen Ma Hadawatha? (recorded at the SLBC as a ?paryenshana geeyak?). ?Pinibara Malak? was his second song.? ?
?Sanda Horen Horen?, written for Amaradeva to a melody by the inimitable Premasiri Khemadasa, was his third. Recorded for Amaradeva?s 50th birthday, and included in an album titled ?Aradhana?, ?Sanda Horen Horen? was released in 1978, the same year that Kularatne waded into his second career: as one of the pioneers of the cassette industry in this country. By the time Aradhana was released, the industry had more or less ?picked up?, but it still lacked a proper, cohesive framework and a set of determined professionals who could take it beyond just a fringe business and trade. Kularatne was a government servant at the time, and he left his job, eventually, to join Tharanga, firstly as a lyricist and later as a production coordinator. He abandoned his job in the civil service completely two years later, when he joined Singlanka at the invitation of his friend, Ananda Ganegoda. Sadly, while Tharanga continues to sell, Singlanka has passed away, a death that was anyway expected given the rise of the internet.? ?
Cassette industry
What compelled the man to join the cassette industry in the first place? ?When you think of music cassettes today, you often think that it?s a business infested with commercialism and a lack of professional ethics. That wasn?t the case in our time. We started Singlanka because we felt that our artists needed an outlet through which they could sustain their lives. This applied, incidentally, to not just established performers, but also promising newcomers like Lakshman Wijesekara. We took them in without any hesitation because the only path they could carve for themselves lay in the SLBC, and even that had become a virtual monopoly. There was a way in which the private sector could help. We were in one sense I suppose experimenters, who wanted to see how it could help them.?? ?
It was through Singlanka that the man met another future collaborator, Rohana Weerasinghe. ?Rohana eventually became a good friend of mine. If I were to name my composers in the order of the frequency of my collaborations with them, he would come first.? This is borne out by a perusal of his collection: more than half the songs in Pinibara Malak have been composed by Weerasinghe. Among others, I spot out H. M. Jayawardhana, Khemadasa, and Victor. As for the vocalists, T. M. Jayaratne, Sunil Edirisinghe, Sanath Nandasiri, Amaradeva, and Nanda Malini crop up regularly. He?s worked with them all, simply put.? ?
Buttressing all this were the directors who opted for him in their films: not just the mainstream classics we hear on the radio so often, like ?Seetha Arane? and ?Aradhana? from Aradhana, or ?Hima Kandu Yahane? from Sasara Chethana, but even less popular tunes like ?Eka Mawakage Diyaniyak Nowei? from Sumitra Peries?s Yahalu Yeheli or ?Wadina Hiruta Mal Landun? from Anton Gregory?s Paramitha. Kularatne?s name has passed by, unnoticed, because of the inscrutable way in which these films were ignored in later years (a fate that Ajantha Ranasinghe did not meet), which is why I think his anthology matters: it includes songs which I had, until now, never associated with the man. There?s another as important point here: unlike Ranasinghe, he?s worked with recent producers, directors, vocalists, and composers as well, including Udayakantha Warnasuriya, Uresha Ravihari, Senesh Bandara, and Nawarathne Gamage.? ?
?
?By the time Aradhana was released, the industry had more or less ?picked up?, but it still lacked a proper, cohesive framework and a set of determined professionals who could take it beyond just a fringe business and trade
Like Amarasiri Peiris, whom I talked with more than a year ago, Kularatne professes an interest in the present generation, and like Peiris, his reason for so doing is that there are reckonable talents from that generation working from the sidelines who, sadly, can?t enter the mainstream because of the vested interests and forces which are pitted against them. Working with them, for him and thus for us, is one way, in fact the best way, through which their talents (or ?bright youngsters? as he calls them) can be legitimised. It?s interesting to note here that while several artists and vocalists from his time have personally told me that they have vowed to never work with my generation, the optimism which Kularatne puts out is a refreshing contrast to the deeply embedded conservatism and Puritanism of those other artists. Working from the past is the best method through which the present can be sustained. Perhaps that?s what Kularatne, whose own two sons, Vindana and Kalpana, have given us an objet d?art that?s so excitingly contemporary (Premaya Nam) has taught us. I?m no poet, only a writer, but the poet in me, if there?s one at all, can thus rest happily.? ? ?

Attack on Muslims only help justify Washington?s demand: Kunanayakam
	
Sri Lanka's former permanent representative to the UN Tamara Kunanayakam said yesterday the attacks targeting a particular ethnic or religious group would only help justify Washington?s demand that universal jurisdiction or external intervention be applied to Sri Lanka through implementation of its 2015 Human Rights Council.
?Washington has been concerned that its resolution has been widely contested by the Sri Lankan people, including at the highest level of State. The return of the controversial US Peace Corps, a ?soft power? weapon in Washington?s arsenal that had been expelled by the Government of Sirimavo Bandaranaike for spying for the CIA reflects Washington?s fears about the forthcoming General Elections and Presidential Elections,? she said and added that the US Peace Corps had been expelled from a number of countries for spying for the CIA and other covert activities, meddling in local politics, and running drugs.
She said the results of the local government election have made it all the more urgent for Washington to strengthen its allies in Government.
?The US Ambassador?s Viceroy-like behaviour even before all the results of the local government elections were released to the public, rushing as he did to request the President not to replace the Prime Minister, demonstrated the extent to which Washington would be ready to go to maintain the status quo,? she said and added that the anti-Muslim attacks provided just such an opportunity.
Ms. Kunanayakam said the timing of the attacks to coincide with the sessions of the Human Rights Council, the arrival of the US Peace Corps, and the arrival of the UN under Secretary General for Political Affairs Jeffrey Feltmann, a former US Assistant Secretary of State, was not fortuitous.
?It gave the High Commissioner the opportunity to threaten Sri Lanka with universal jurisdiction if it fails to make progress in accountability and transitional justice. His choice of language is to target only the previous Government under Mahinda Rajapaksa, to strengthen Washington?s allies within the present regime, and to advance Washington?s project to gain international legitimacy for its unilateral interventions in the internal affairs of other States,? she said.
She said the attacks also helped advance Feltman?s agenda, which was inseparable from the agenda of Washington.
?Feltman is a neoconservative hawk who has been involved in fomenting violence and the break-up of sovereign States into ethnic enclaves. Within the UN, he is also responsible for a team working on constitutional arrangements promoting federalism as a response to ethnic minority grievances,? she said and added that describing the anti-Muslim clashes as a conflict between Buddhists and Muslims or between Sinhalese and Muslims only served such an agenda, a agenda that aims at dividing people on ethnic/religious lines, fomenting conflict between them, keeping them permanently divided and weak, ultimately permitting partition of their country and imposition of the infamous Kosovo-model.

Deepal?s Inward Bound proves effective in the corporate world

The book has been well received by the readers as evidenced by the responses given below;
?In a constantly rushed and stressed world that attempts to impress the outwards, Deepal?s books took me inwards, helped me step back and focus on the now, this very moment. Written in a simple and humble manner (much like the author), [I] strongly recommend this book especially for Corporate Executives suffering from the ?busy-ness? syndrome. This book made me think, reflect, and ponder. Hilmy Cader, CEO, MTI Consulting
?I read your book and learnt a lesson - one officer who is in the grade of AssistantManager? always annoys me , he uses the authority? ?of an Officer of the higher management .He uses his powers on us. Whenever I see him, even in the morning, I get angry with him which disturbs me the whole day.But after reading your book I tried to see some good things about him. Once he was sick, and? ?I went to him and asked about his sickness, this simple act changed his attitude towards me? an employee of a leading organization.
?
I have read your book Inward Bounda few months back and realized how such asimple concept could have such a huge potential. I have read a couple of other books on the same vertical but the simplicity itself in the book made me really embrace the entire concept. Sandagomi Jeewapadma, Mobitel Pvt Ltd.?
This simple and pragmatic, yeteasy concepts capture many key aspects of our daily lives that Deepal has highlighted in the form of short but powerful stories.
What makes it powerful is his sharing of personal mastery techniques on how each of them can be well managed for our greater success and fulfilment. Dr Michael Heah, ICF Master Certified Coach.

There is a prominent politico known to have taken the initiative to revoke the law barring the fragmentation of coconut estates in a gallant move to meet a business need of his ladylove.?
?
At a recent a high level conference chaired by the country?s highest political authority, this politico had drawn derisive smiles from all present when he expressed his deep concern over the continuing practice of breaking up of coconut plantations into small lots for commercial and residential purposes.
Several politicos who attended this conference had expressed their views on the factors that have contributed to the shortfall in coconut production leading to the current high price in the market.
One participant conspicuous by the red shirt he was wearing had remarked that the politico responsible for lifting the prohibition on fragmenting coconut plantations too was present at this conference.? However, the politico to whom the remark was targeted had been seen engrossed in some documentation, they say.

Many politicos had deliberately kept away from the district in the hills when it was hit by communal riots, but most of them were seen later in a long queue to show their face to a very high authority when the latter visited the hill capital in a damage control bid, they say.

According to reports, only a handful of politicos from the district had taken the trouble to rush to the troubled areas to make an effort to bring the ugly situation under control.
A number of politicos representing the people in the district at both local and national levels had rushed to Kandy as soon as they had learnt about the high authority?s visit there. Only the ones who were busy in the volatile areas trying their best to defuse tensions and prevent further incidents had to give the high authority?s visit a miss, they say.?

Med. students? parents  complain to BC
	
Parents' Union of Medical Students (PUMS) today made a complaint to the Bribery Commission stating that the University Grants? Commission (UGC) and the Higher Education Ministry had shied away from its responsibilities when enrolling students to South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM).
Executive member of the Union Asoka Ranwala said both the UGC and the ministry had granted approval to students who did not meet the basic qualifications required for the study of? medicine.
In its complaint, the Association had urged the Commission to institute legal action against the UGC and the ministry, after conducting an impartial inquiry.
Mr. Ranwala said due to the improper and corrupt mechanism followed when registering? students to the SAITM, it was now difficult to resolve the controversy.
At a press conference in Colombo, the Association questioned the move to sell the Neville Fernando Teaching Hospital (NFTH).
Union Secretary Wasantha Alwis said, though there were claims from the government of its acquisition of the NFTH, the newspapers carried an advertisement by Dr. Neville Fernando for the sale of the NFTH.
He further said that the Association hopes to lodge a complaint next week with? the Bribery Commission, as the Government has already pumped in funds of more than Rs. 3 billion per year.
As such, he said the ownership of the hospital is questionable, and it would be a misuse of public funds if the government had not acquired it and was permitting Dr. Neville Fernando to sell the NFTH.?? (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

OMP will trace missing, make recommendations: Chairman
	
While assuring that the OMP would address cases of missing persons irrespective of their ethnicity, the Office on Missing Persons (OMP) Chairman Saliya Pieris PC today said the Commission would trace the missing and make recommendation to prevent recurrence of such incidents.
In a statement, he said the?OMP was mandated with four key tasks which include?tracing the missing and disappeared persons, clarifying the circumstances in which the act took place and?protecting the rights and interests of those missing/disappeared and their next of kin.?
?The OMP will also identify avenues of redress for those affected and make?recommendations to the relevant authorities in order to prevent the recurrence of such incidents,? he said.
He said given the magnitude of the problem and the complexity with respect to the multiple tasks required to search for the missing and the disappeared, the OMP will function as a permanent office, as legislated. ?
?It will be the task of the present members to establish a credible, efficient and strong institution, which over a period of time will be able to provide relief to the many affected persons and communities,? he said.
He assured the OMP will address the many cases of missing and disappeared persons irrespective of ethnicity, religion and region.
?The main purpose of the OMP is to address the suffering of the many thousands of families living in all parts of the country whose loved ones have gone missing or disappeared during multiple conflicts,? he said.
Meanwhile, he said the missing and disappeared cases that the OMP will examine cover both civilians and combatants.
?We are deeply committed to the welfare of all the victims of Sri Lanka's conflicts.?We are also mindful of the need to perform our functions impartially and objectively. Victim-centeredness will set?a guiding principle for the operationalization of the OMP. We recognize that the establishment of such a mechanism is long overdue,? Chairman Pieris?said.?
He added the families of the disappeared and of the missing have suffered the tragic loss of their loved ones?and many of these families have waited years?for answers as to whether their loved ones are alive or dead.
?This long wait has deepened their anguish, frustration and trauma. In what we hope is a shared vision for lasting peace and co-existence, we invite the people of Sri Lanka to provide us the strength and support required to achieve the objectives of the OMP Act,? he said.(Lahiru Pothmulla)

Regulations needed to stop misuse of cloud apps: JHU
	
The Government should introduce new regulations to regulate cloud applications like Facebook or WhatsApp to prevent their improper use, Jathika Hela Urumaya General Secretary and Minister Champika Ranawaka said today.
He said the restrictions imposed on social media could be removed now as the tense situation was under control and the Government had taken measures to restrict access to social media to prevent the propagation of hate speech among the people considering the situation in the country.
The minister said the JHU agreed with the Government?s decision, as it was a globally followed practice in times of such situations and pointed out that following the bomb blast in Pune in India, the authorities even had to restrict mobile text messages to control Hindu-Muslim riots.
He said the survival of the world?s largest companies depended on the Internet and the majority benefited by it.
?There is no future without cloud applications such as Facebook and WhatsApp. The main feature of the 4th Technical Revolution that occurred after 2010 is the collective stream of main technologies and in the present day all technology including robotics, nano tech, quantum or satellite technology is connected with the internet,? the minister said.
He said some countries such as China had developed their own social media networks and search engines.
?As the country has not yet reached such level of development, Sri Lanka has to use the present technology, while tightening the regulations to prevent improper usage,? the minister said and added that an agile Government was needed to respond to such situations immediately so as to prevent mass scale destruction.

Riots in Kandy   Choosing hatred and suspicion  over tolerance and love
	
?
When we fill our mind with ideas that detach man from man, which makes one a Sinhalese and the other a Muslim, or one a Tamil, life becomes agonizing
?
More than a hundred Buddhist monks, members of the National Bhikku Front and other activist groups staged a protest in the city of Colombo on March 9 (Friday) against what they termed the destruction of national unity and to condemn anti-Muslim riots. The silent protest was organised by the Maha Sangha who realized that there is no bigger distortion of Buddha Dhamma than man-slaughter in the name of Buddhism.The extent and level of riots and destruction in Kandy was greater and more extensive than that of Ampara in the East.The violence affected Teldeniya, Katugastota, Aladeniya, Digana, and Abathenna.? ?
UNP MP Mujibur Rahman speaking in Parliament said, ?I complained several times to the police headquarters regarding this racism. I requested the President at group meetings to take action. But unfortunately as a Government, we have done nothing to stop this situation.??
?Muslims helped the military during war against the ruthless LTTE. Military intelligence during the conflict was completely run by the Muslim officers helped by their civilian community?- former Navy Chief.?
When the riots broke-out, a confused Sirisena-Wickremesinghe unity Government after some initial dilly-dallying got into delayed action. An island-wide emergency was declared and police curfews enforced in affected areas. The military was deployed to coordinate with the Police Special Task Force in combating violence.? ?
The Government must ensure that notorious individuals, who have incited communal violence, particularly those who have preached hatred openly and publicly, be arrested, investigated and prosecuted following due course of the law. Social media like Facebook, WhatsApp, viber and other communication techniques were being used to transmit misinformation and hate speech aimed at provocation of more violence.? ?
Blocking of social media?
However, the blocking of social media and other communication channels, though with valid reasons, affects persons from seeking help, especially journalists from coverage around the state of affairs. Such decisions should be limited to a short duration. A better approach would be to convey the true facts or reality against these hateful rhetoric recounts by emphasizing that Sri Lanka is a multilingual, multi-national and multi-religious country in which all the people?s rights and privileges are equally protected and respected. Government must take drastic action against both the politicians and non-politicians who advocate national, racial and religious hatred. Failure to act against those accountable for destruction, those who caused damage and loss and others for inaction is a failure of civilization as a whole.? ?
On 7th Wednesday, there were reports that one member of the mob, a father of a two year-old child, had died when the hand grenade that he was carrying exploded. His wife was reported to be an expectant mother, who would be compensated with poor tax payers money. Laws needed to be enacted to recover such costs from the people responsible for directly and indirectly instigating mobs on violence. The indirect category obviously belongs to the opposition?s political hate-speakers.? ?
??I think that hate is a feeling that can only exist where there is no understanding.??
- Tennessee Williams? ?
Escape from reality
When we fill our mind with ideas that detach man from man, which makes one a Sinhalese and the other a Muslim, or one a Tamil, life becomes agonizing. We then destroy each other in our eager to have a superior life, an escape from reality. All religions have failed miserably in bringing peace to this country.? ?
A Muslim man was killed, mosques, businesses and houses were set on fire and innocent Muslim men, women and children were subject to violence by Sinhala-Buddhist mobs in Kandy. Most Buddhists base their stands on false beliefs, mistaken presumptions and vague perceptions. The truth has to be inculcated or taught until they would understand the real elementary Buddhist pedestal which is tolerance and love, not hatred and suspicion.? ?
?
?Government must take drastic action against both the politicians and non-politicians who advocate national, racial and religious hatred. Failure to act against those accountable for destruction, those who caused damage and loss and others for inaction is a failure of civilization as a whole
Asgiriya and Malwatte Prelates?
Reminiscing his nostalgic memories of World War II, Dr H.S.S. Nissanka, author, writing in 2009 reveals a secret Most Ven. Welivita Saranankara Maha Nayaka Thera of Malwatta Chapter had told him in a casual conversation. When the War broke out in 1939, he was 11-years-old and the Japanese bombed Colombo on April 5, 1942. Lord Mountbatten, the head of the South East Asia High Command, was staying in the King?s Pavilion. He also had his war office at the Botanical Gardens in Peradeniya and Headquarters at Kundasale. The War Council consisting of Lord Mountbatten, Geoffrey Layton, Sir John Kotelawala and Sir D.B. Jayatilaka had met in Colombo after the Japanese bombed Colombo. The British officials had been suspicious of Asgiriya and the Malwatte prelates that they would support the Japanese given the Buddhist connections.
Therefore, the British High Command had decided to confine the Maha Sangha of Asgiriya and Malwatte Chapters to house arrest and also some members were to be executed. Sir John Kotelawala and Sir D.B. Jayatilake rushed to Kandy and conveyed the plot to the prelates and got the monks to sign a statement affirming their loyalty to the British crown, averting an unprecedented scenario.? ?
The Mahanayake Thero?s has not expressed repulsion and disapproval over acts of instigation or goons burning the possessions of Muslims. The authorities must bring these happenings to the Venerable Mahanayake thero?s attention. We are at present going through a course of reconciliation, which is essential to the public order. The Government is making a slow effort toward uniting the country, so that it would by no means slip back to a civil war. We are a plural society with quite a few religions and ethnicities. This is the truth and we have to face that reality. A periodic flare-up and clashes arise among various divisions. We must learn to deal with such adverse events. Religious dignitaries, especially the Buddhists must take the responsibility of convincing the misguided using the hallowed teachings of Gautama Buddha.? ?
The Gautama Buddha warned against humiliation of people based on race, caste and religion. Buddhism constitutes a Dhamma that promotes complete nonviolence. Human discrimination of all sorts are condemned in it. Sri Lanka is a country where the Buddhists are the majority, the emergence of such trends which slows down collective progress has to be countered effectively. The situation demands a serious discussion between the monks and the laity on the compassionate vision of Buddha Dhamma. Cultural and Linguistic identities are the main causes for separatists activities in multi-ethnic nations. The most frightening one appears to be the prejudices aimed at the minorities by some politicians. Discrimination in any form is totally unacceptable under Buddhist teachings. The stoic silence or delayed response on the part of Mahanayake Theros to junior members of the sasana who are involved in violent acts, cannot be condoned. Today no ruler would ever dare to confine the prelates to ?temple-arrest?; they have nothing to fear, they can come out of their abodes during a catastrophe.?

Minister of Youth Affairs and Southern Development Sagala Ratnayake in a tweet yesterday said that the recent ban on social media creates a negative impact on many industries including the IT, E-commerce and tourism sectors.
?Social media ban makes a negative impact on many industries. Apart from general frustration it creates, such blanket bans will take a heavy toll on the economy and hamper IT, E-comm & tourism sectors. What the government must promote is a responsible use of social media with checks and balances,? he said.
He urged the government to unblock the access to social media before it hampers the country?s economy.
?Blocking Facebook and messaging apps long term is not an option. Social Media must start functioning so that the economy doesn?t suffer. Therefore, access to Social Media must be unblocked ASAP and the Government must set in place a system to curtail hate speech and fake news,? he said. (Thilanka Kanakarathne)

State Minister for Fishery and Aquatic Resource Development Dilip Wedaarachchi said yesterday that steps would be taken by the UNP to field a new candidate for the forthcoming Presidential Election and defeat the boasting Lotus flower bud (Pohottuwa).
Addressing an event at the UNP office in Tangalle, he said "there are certain political conditions that emerged through the prevailing crises in the country. We feel that UNP supporters are going away from us. However, the general public has given us a red light during the local government elections for us to work more efficiently and solve the existing problems. That does not mean that the government should change but to change the existing system. Accordingly, we have decided to face the next elections more strongly with a new presidential candidate. ?
He pointed out that the government could do away with the infamous history that had been created by the former rulers after coming to power within a very short time and that it would take longer to erase the black mark added through the opportunistic politics which had unleashed the flames of racial hatred among the communities. He emphasized the fact that, as a result of this situation it has adversely affected the tourist industry as well as some acute problems that have emerged in the economic, social and political fields.

Violent extremism shows its seeds can grow anywhere

Their desperate faces?stared at the houses and shops torched and destroyed in Digana, Teldeniya and Ambatenne areas. By March 10, as the curfew was lifted in Kandy, various groups of people started visiting the troubled areas. Local and international media personnel were seen taking photographs and interviewing the victims affected by this violence. But these victims continued to pose one question, ?what did we do to them (attackers) to suffer like this?. Basins filled with water could be seen inside some houses and shops that had not been attacked. When asked why, they said that fear was still in the air. They said that the water?was kept to douse a fire in case mobs decide to?torch their houses.? ?
In a country that had been severely suffered due to an ethnic war that raged for decades, rumors sufficed to trigger more communal riots. And that is what happened in Kandy. Villagers in Digana, Teldeniya, Kengalla and Ambatenne said that the attacks were the result of a highly orchestrated move that was backed by huge political support.? ?
From the previous article titled ?A divided Digana falls: Isolated incident used to fuel tension? published on March 7, we recounted the main incident which triggered the March 5 attacks in Digana and Teldeniya. Despite a curfew and security forces being deployed in many areas in Kandy, attacks were launched again targeting several houses, shops and a mosque, but the assailants new targeted area was Ambatenne. The date was March 7 and these incidents happened in the morning.
J.J.Udaya is a Sinhala Buddhists employed at Zilmiya Saw Mill in Ambatenne. The mill, owned by a Muslim businessman named Abdul Bashir Ramsan Mohommed, was built in 1970s. The mill has been a place which has offered employment to a large number of Buddhists in the area. Mobs, provoked by news that a temple adjoining the Mill had been stoned, set the Mill and several houses in Ambatenne on fire on March 7. When we visited the area on March 10, smoke was still rising from the burning wooden logs in the Mill, despite a drizzle.? Udaya, who was inside the Mill during the attack, told the Daily mirror? that the attack took place in plain view of fully armed police, who watched the mayhem unfold without taking action.? ?

Attackers came with faces covered
?
?I told them that this is the place that provides income for us, mostly Sinhala Buddhists, but by pleas went unheeded. There were hardly much villagers in the crowd.-J.J.Udaya

?Around 500 youths broke the gate and started destroying the mill. They took the diesel which was inside the storeroom of the mill and set the entire place ablaze. I was pushed away when I tried to stop the attackers. I told them that this is the place that provides income for us, mostly Sinhala Buddhists, but by pleas went unheeded. There were hardly much villagers in the crowd. The attackers were outsiders who had covered their faces and tinted their hair with highlighting colours. It?s so painful to watch the place where all of us worked as brothers, being burnt down by some outsiders,? reminisced Udaya.?
There is no connection between the Ambatenne attack and the death of the Sinhala driver in Digana. This is merely an orchestrated programme with deep political support.-Mohommed
?
?
The owner of the mill, Mohommed, told the Daily mirror? that many Muslim businessmen, including him, had made contributions to build the temple which came under attack in Ambatenne. He said that he had not missed attending pageants and poojas (religious activities where offerings are made) organized by the temple.??
?
My house was attacked thrice. The Special Task Force was present when the attack took place.-N.S.M.Jameel
?Mohommed made a request to the Government. ?There is no connection between the Ambatenne attack and the death of the Sinhala driver in Digana. This is merely an orchestrated programme with deep political support. It isn?t enough probing only into Thajudeen?s murder and the corruption charges against Namal Rajapaksa. The Government should investigate the entire Kandy incident and take punitive measures against the culprits,? he said.? ?
N.S.M.Jameel still remained shocked after seeing his completely torched and partly destroyed house which he built with his hard-earned money. Only a few walls are left of the house. Jameel?s house is one of the few that could be found in the area and it had all modern facilities. The attackers didn?t only set the house ablaze, but also robbed gold jewelry worth millions. Jameel had collected these valuables over a period of many years for her only daughter?s wedding, which was to take place in two months time. Jameel, now in his mid-sixties, is in tears as all what he had earned through dedication and hard work for decades, have now been destroyed.? ?

grenade explosion
?My house was attacked thrice. They threw all the furniture out and torched the house. The Special Task Force was present when the attack took place. Although the attack was launched by outsiders, some villagers also supported them, especially in pinpointing the homes and shops belonging to Muslims,? complained Jameel.? ?
The violence took away another life in Ambatenne when a hand grenade was exploded. Eight people were injured in this attack. On March 6, 29-year-old R.M.Gunarathne Banda had been making preparations to have a sermon at his residence to seek blessings for his wife, who is seven months pregnant with their second child. White flags, put up in connection with the sermon, decorated the roads. A white coloured hut had been set up at the premises which housed his residence. This hut was to be used for the sermon, scheduled for March 9. Life is so unpredictable! Banda?s funeral was held in the same vicinity. His loved ones and relations paid their last respects to him on the day which this sermon was organised for his wife.?

His life was snatched away while he was off to work to earn his daily wage to feed me and my son. My husband, a mason by profession, was a law-abiding citizen.-Ruwani Kosala
?
?
The mourning widow Ruwani Kosala Pathirana could barely talk. She said that Banda had left home in the morning on March 7 telling her and his mother that he heading for work. Banda, a mason by profession, was a law-abiding citizen, according to Kosala.? ? ?His life was snatched away while he was off to work to earn his daily wage to feed me and my son,? she said.? ?

A weeping?mother?s story
?
A hand grenade had been exploded, killing my innocent son. This violence should be stopped at any cost. I don?t want another mother like me to undergo the same pain.-R.M.Podi Menike
?
?
?
The voice of R.M.Podi Menike, Bandara?s mother, was not clear due to the shock. Podi Manike was making a great effort to reminisce how she struggled to contact his son once she had heard about the alleged attack on the temple in Ambatenne. Podi Menike had dialed her son?s number more than twenty times in search of his whereabouts. She had suspected that he could be affected due to the ongoing turmoil in the area. She had even tried to reach the area where the turmoil was taking place. But family members and neighbours had stopped her. Since Banda had failed to pick up any calls, his mother?s fear s were mounting. It was around 11.30 am when her twenty fourth attempt in finding some information was successful. Podi Menike had heard a female voice from the other side of the line. It was the voice of a nurse at the Kandy Hospital who informed the weeping mother that his son had sustained injuries. Podi Manike, accompanied by some of Banda?s close relatives, rushed to the hospital.??
All of a sudden, a hand grenade was thrown to where we were from a two storeyed building?
in First Post Junction?in Ambatenne.-Sadeep?
?
?There was my beloved son?s lifeless body lying in a pool of blood in the hospital. A hand grenade had been exploded, killing my innocent son. This violence should be stopped at any cost. I don?t want another mother like me to undergo the same pain. No more mothers should lose their sons and daughters. The responsible authorities should take action to prevent such unfortunate incidents happening in the future,? she said.
? ?While several youths, injured in the hand grenade explosion, are currently receiving treatment at the hospital, eighteen-year-old Sadeep survived with minor injuries. Sadeep doesn?t even know who he was with when the explosion had taken place. He said he was accompanied by friends to witness the attack on temple.? ?

We asked whether he saw the grenade being thrown towards where he was from the building that?s mentioned. He replied in the negative. He added that he was told by others that the grenade was thrown to their side.? ?

Relationship with??the temple
There had been no problems between the Sinhalese and the Muslims. All the community meetings of the Muslims are held inside the temple. The water supply for the Zilmiya Mill, which had been torched, is also provided by the temple-Ven. Piyarathana Thera?of Mullegama:

?
?Ven. Piyarathana Thera of Mullegama Sri Vidarshanaramaya in Ambatenne said that a group of outsiders were involved in the stone throwing incident, which targeted the temple.? ?
?People gathered in the morning on hearing the news that the temple had come under attack. Security officers were also present and ready to move into action if the situation worsened. First, there were only dozens of men who were villagers. Within an hour a number of vehicles arrived and I witnessed thousands of men on the road.?
The majority of them are unknown to me. I have no idea how that amount of people flocked to the place within a short period of time. We tried to ease the situation with the support of security officers. After a few minutes, we came to know that a hand grenade had been exploded, killing a villager. That was when the groups started burning down the houses and shops,? recalled the priest.? ?
The monk explained how the relations between the two communities had existed in the past.? ?
?There had been no problems between the Sinhalese and the Muslims. All the community meetings of the Muslims are held inside the temple. The water supply for the Zilmiya Mill, which had been torched, is also provided by the temple. The business entities of Muslims are run because of Sinhala customers. Many of our Sinhala people are employed at their businesses,? said the priest.? ?
Piyarathana Thera noted that the attacks in Ambatenna, Digana and Teldeniya were carried out by a group of opportunists who shamelessly carried out a racist campaign in order to fulfill their whims and fancies. ?The motivation to fuel violence comes inappropriate attempts to handle emotions. Often, violence is the medium used by an individual to openly express his or he anger. Violence can also be considered as a tool by which individuals get what they want,? the Thera opined.? ?
Meanwhile, Mawlawi of Digana Jummah Mosque, Mohommed Rasmi said regardless of race and religion, all the communities should be brought together to heal the wounds of the innocent victims. He said the country would not be able to make progress if citizens are separated because of racist ideologies.??

?Racism is morally wrong. You should learn to know that racism doesn?t help and it only adds to your frustrations. Don?t let your happiness be ruined by being racist. Racism is something you can avoid at all cost. Try befriending a person from another race. We are human beings. We all are Sri Lankans,? he affirmed.? ?

?
Meanwhile, in separate letters addressing President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, the Human Rights Commission Sri Lanka (HRCSL) has said that investigations carried out by the commission found that a group of outsiders created the unrest between Muslims and Sinhalese communities in areas of Kandy. The HRCSL said that incidents in the recent past targeting Muslims had been instigated by groups from outside the respective areas.
The HRCSL urged the President and Prime Minister to act swiftly and take appropriate action against those directly involved in the violence and those who instigated and provided organisational strength for such violence.

What action against 'forgotten' Mahendran? GL
	
The Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) today said Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe should reveal the course of action which would be taken against Arjuna Mahendran who was ordered to report to the CID on March 8 but failed to do so.
Addressing a news briefing of the Joint Opposition, SLPP Chairman G.L. Peiris said former Central Bank governor Arjuna Mahendran had failed to report to the CID on two occasions though he was ordered by the Courts do so over the bond scam investigation.
?Mr. Mahendran was ordered to report to the CID on February 15 and again on March 8. However, he had not reported so far. Prime Minister Wickremesinghe assured he would take responsibility of Mr. Mahendran?s appointment and that he would take measures to recover the loss incurred by the State as a result of the bond scam. If Mahendran is not returning, the Premier should reveal what action he would take to recover the losses,? he said.
Meanwhile, he said the Perpetual Treasuries Limited (PTL) owned by Mr. Mahendran?s son in law Arjuna Aloysius, had maintained a bank account under the name of Mendis Distilleries to pay exorbitant bribes.
?This account had a balance of Rs. 1,200 million at first and its funds had been withdrawn on 120 occasions while the COPE hearings into the bond scam were taking place. The account had been emptied soon after. The Bribery Commission should look into this and find out where the money which was in the Mendis Distilleries account, ended up,? he said.
