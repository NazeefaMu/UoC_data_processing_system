Apeksha Hospital to receive long awaited PET scanner on Jan. 25
	
The long awaited Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scanner which was purchased by public contribution will be arrive at the Maharagama Apeksha Hospital on January 25, Kadijah Foundation President and the Fight Cancer Founder Dr. M S H Mohamed said yesterday.
The high tech state of the art machine which costs around Rs. 202 million was a ?Siemens? brand product of Germany with a capacity of performing over 100 scans per month.
Dr. Mohamed said it would take nearly a month to install the machine and the patients could receive the service from March.
It is learnt that one private hospital has the country's only PET scan scanner and the cost of a scan is around Rs.150,000.
However, with the arrival of the new PET scannerat the Apeksha Hospital, it is planned to provide the service free of charge.
Dr. Mohamed said the vaccine to be injected to the patients before the scan will cost some Rs. 30,000 and hoped to import it from India with the government sponsorship.
The PET machine is to be installed in a separate building at the Apeksha Hospital with the recommendations of the Sri Lanka Atomic Energy Board.
He said 90 percent of the construction of the building has been completed and the rest would be completed before March.
Dr. Mohamed also added that a nine-member team of radiologists would be sent to Germany immediately to familiarize themselves with the operation of the machine.
The PET scanner which was a huge shortage to the health care sector became a reality due to the contribution of 20 million people and the commitment of some 150 dedicated members of the Kadijah Foundation and the Fight Cancer. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

China to cap overseas withdrawals using domestic bank cards
	
REUTERS: China?s foreign exchange regulator will cap overseas withdrawals using domestic Chinese bank cards at 100,000 yuan (US $ 15,370) per year in an effort to target money laundering, terrorist financing and tax evasion, it said?on Saturday.
Individuals who exceed the annual quota will be suspended from overseas transactions for the remainder of the year and an additional year, the State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE) said in a notice posted?on its website.
Under the new rules SAFE will submit a daily list of individuals banned from making overseas bank card withdrawals and banks must suspend the users by no later than 5 p.m. the same day, the notice said.
Domestic card users will also be barred from withdrawing more than 10,000 yuan a day overseas, it said.
The new rules come into effect on January 1 and reporting adjustments must be adopted by banks by April 1, 2018, it said.
China has strengthened regulatory oversight of overseas card transactions in the past year, targeting illegal cross-border transfers and money laundering.
In September SAFE brought in regulations requiring Chinese banks to report daily their bank card holders? overseas withdrawals as well as every transaction exceeding 1,000 yuan.
China?s foreign exchange reserves rose for the 10th straight month in November due to tighter regulation and a stronger yuan, which continue to discourage capital outflows.?

Controversy Over D. A. RAJAPAKSA MEMORIAL MUSEUM
	
?
?
With the Appeal Court issuing an interim order not to file charges under the Public Property Act for his role in the alleged misappropriation of Government funds worth over Rs. 60 million rupees to build a monument for his parents,?former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa?has contested the authenticity of his signature on official documents and claimed that a ?verbal contract? existed in connection with his family foundation and the Government, the Dailymirror??learns.
According to submissions made to the Colombo Fort Magistrate Court (B/30485/ 4/ 15) by the Financial Crimes Investigation Division (FCID), one institution coming under the purview of former Defence Secretary Rajapaksa bore??the cost to construct his father?s monument and memorial museum. Rajapaksa, who contests the allegations, is suspected of having used his official position to cause the misappropriation of state funds for this purpose, a non-bailable charge under the Offences against Public Property Act.? ?
According to the former Defence Secretary, he had verbally agreed with the Sri Lanka Land Reclamation and Development Corporation (SLLRDC) to get the D.A. Rajapaksa monument??and memorial museum constructed at Weeraketiya, agreeing in the process to pay the money back through his family foundation.??
?However, several higher officials in their statements to the FCID had stated that there was no agreement, either written or verbal, between the Corporation and any party for this project, and that hey had acted solely on the Defence Secretary?s instructions.
?
Musical shows? ?
The ?B? reports submitted to courts summarize the statements by the higher officials at?SLLRDC including Chairman Prasad Harshan??de Silva (Who held office during the Rajapaksa era), members of the Board of Directors and the General Manager. According to their statements, the SLLRDC had planned to appoint a committee to organize several musical shows to generate funds with the aim of recovering the money spent on building the D.A. Rajapaksa monument??and memorial museum (Weeraketiya Project).?
However, so far, no official records have been produced to corroborate this claim. Meanwhile in an audit query on the??Weeraketiya Project,??questions have been raised as to on whose advise the Navy was directed to provide the manpower for construction work.?By letter dated September 3, 2013 Chairman SLLRDC had informed the Navy Commander to carry out the construction work.? ?
The letter, written for this purpose, states ?further to the meeting held at the??Ministry of Defence and Urban Development??on August 29, 2013, we have been advised to request the???SL Navy to carry out the construction of the D.A. Rajapaksa Memorial at Medamulana.? ?
?Therefore please make arrangements to commence this work early as it has to be completed by early November 2014 for the opening on November 10, 2014. The architectural drawings and structural drawings of the memorial done by us are ready with us to commence the work. Chairman SLLRDC?.? ?
By letter dated February 12, 2014, DGM (Drainage and Reclamation)??S.P. Muthumala to the Chairman and General Manager had requested to release Rs.10 million to the Sri Lanka Navy to commence the work until the approval of the Board of Directors is obtained.?
The letter further states, ?On the directives given by the Ministry of Defence and Urban Development, the Corporation was involved in the preparation of drawings and BOQ for the above work.
The BOQ was submitted by the R & D division which amounts to Rs.33.944 million a copy of which is annexed.? ?
?The Sri Lanka Navy has sent us a letter No: DGCE/ DIR/ SOUTH/ 11/ 2013 dated January 27, 2014 requesting us to release an advance payment of Rs.10 million to procure the required materials to commence and mobilize the above site. Therefore your approval is hereby sought to release Rs.10 million to Sri Lanka Navy to commence the work at site until the approval of the Board of Directors is obtained?.? ?
?
Feared losing her job? ?
Knowing that this procedure was against SLLRDC rules and regulations,??General Manager Srimathi Mallika Kumari Senadheera??who is alleged to have given instructions to carry out the project is said to have instructed the DGM (Finance) to release the money.? ?
However, in her statement to the???FCID Senadheera??had stated that she had to instruct her officers to make payments to the above project on the directives of the Chairman and that she had to give such instructions in fear of losing her job in the event she opposed to release money. According to her statement, SLLRDC undertakes private constructions, but during such an event, at the time of signing the contract, 20% of the estimated cost was obtained and money was taken after producing the bills. As this was not a private construction, the Corporation did not enter into an agreement with Rajapaksa nor charged 20% of the estimated cost and states that only after the FCID started the investigation, that Rs.25 million had been remitted to the SLLRDC account from the D.A. Rajapaksa Foundation.? ?
However when contacted, General Manager SLLRDC Srimathi Mallika Kumari Senadheera to find whether a decision had been taken at the 537th board meeting to recover the money from Rajapaksas?, Senadheera said the decision was to recover the money from well-wishers. When??
?
Development Officer Weeraketiya Pradeshiya Sabha, Anthonige Gunathilaka in his statement had said that approval hadn?t been obtained from them for the Weeraketiya Project, hence it is an illegal construction.
?
?
asked whether the ?client? at any stage, after the construction was completed, handed over a request to the SLLRDC to send the bills for the construction, Senadheera said that a request letter was sent only after the FCID investigations were initiated. However she declined to furnish further details and wanted this newspaper to contact the Chairman for further information.? ?
All attempts to contact the Chairman failed as he was not in office.? ?In the meantime, a higher officer at the Auditor General?s Department, who was granted anonymity to discuss official matters, said that although an audit query had been forwarded to SLLRDC Chairman on March 24, 2015, calling for information for clarification, the SLLRDC hadn?t been able to submit proper clarifications regarding the queries.?
According to the audit query, the expenditure regarding this project as at December 31, 2014 was Rs.61.71 million. According to the land reclamation division, the cost was Rs.62.116 million.??
The query further states, ?Without the board approval, SLLRDC Chairman had paid an advance of Rs.10 million to the Sri Lanka Navy.?
The Navy meanwhile had procured more raw materials regarding construction to the value of Rs.14.664 million as of March 25, 2014 and had further requested another Rs.15 million.?
The SLLRDC had released the said money on May 8, 2014. However, the SLLRDC had failed to obtain the expenditure reports from the Navy and had requested to obtain details on whose instruction the project work had been handed??procurement guidelines had not been followed?.
The audit query further reveals as to how the Corporation had offered a contract to Black Stone Engineering without following procurement guidelines and paid??Rs.6.8 million for the landscape and another Rs.1 million to buy ornamental fishes to the pond therein.??
Also, it reveals how SLLRDC had purchased nine copper lotus flowers which had cost Rs.275, 000 each while two crystals had been installed at a cost of Rs.9.24 million. Renovating the access roads had been done at a cost of Rs. 2.673 million. Another Rs.5.372 million had been paid for 33 solar power lamp posts and for four flash lights.?
The SLLRDC had not given authority to the Urban Development Authority (UDA) for the 15,000 granite slabs that had been obtained at a cost of Rs.4.125 million.??
?
NSB loan?<U+200B>
The audit query further states how the SLLRDC had obtained a loan from the National Savings Bank to the tune of Rs.14, 277 million to carry out all its projects to which the Corporation has to pay back Rs.592.791 million during each of the 24 installments.?
Meanwhile the owner of AS Creations, Aruna speaking to the Daily Mirror said how Black Stone Engineering offered a sub contract to his company for the landscape, but the final payment had been withheld by the SLLRDC.?
?My estimated cost was Rs.3.9 million and I was paid an advance of Rs.1 million. I gave them a discount of Rs.400, 000 and the remaining Rs.2.5 million is yet to be reimbursed,? Aruna said.?
?Meanwhile, Rohan Praminda Seneviratne,??a former Director SLLRDC, in his statement had stated that he was an Additional Secretary (Technical) at the Defence Ministry and it was he who forwarded the board decision for the Defence Secretary?s approval as per the letter dated December 9, 2013???Ref: No: MOD/ SEC/PA/ 01(115)?<U+200B>?sent by former Defence Secretary?s Coordinating Secretary???Maj. Gen. H.L. Weeratunge? ??instructing all institutions coming under the Defence Secretary?s purview to obtain the Defence Secretary?s signature before implementing the board decisions. He had further stated that it was he who had prepared the covering letter and received the approval from the Defence Secretary for the above project.? ?
?Former Director????Sirinimal Perera?<U+200B>??during his statement had stated that the board approval to release funds had been granted on the former Chairman?s directives, which didn?t come under the SLLRDC?s purview.? ?
?Indira de Silva (Deputy General Manager-Finance SLLRDC) had stated that on the directives of the General Manager, Rs.10 million was paid as an advance to Sri Lanka Navy on February 13, 2014 without obtaining a board approval and another Rs.15 million on May 8, 2014 after obtaining the board approval on February 26, 2014 for Rs.33.9 million.?
According to her, Rs.3.2624 million had been paid to Black Stone Engineering without following procurement guidelines, but on the instructions of the then Chairman.?
?Assistant Director National Budget Department? ??Harshani Maduka Ranasinghe?states that she is in charge of releasing funds to SLLRDC, but as per the letter dated July 16, 2013,??the SLRDC requested only Rs.6767.05 million for four projects for 2014, but never asked for any allocation for the Weeraketiya project.? ?
?
Illegal construction?
Dananjaya Dharmaratne (DGM (Supply) SLLRDC) states that he had to release goods worth of Rs.16 million for this project and Rs.3.262 million??was paid to Black Stone on the instructions of the Chairman and the General Manager violating Government procurement guidelines and that all purchases had been made on the written requests made by Project Coordinator Deputy General Manager (Drainage and Reclamation) S.P. Muthumala.? ?
?
When contacted, General Manager SLLRDC Senadheera to find whether a decision had been taken at the board meeting to recover the money from Rajapaksas?, Senadheera said the decision was to recover the money from?well-wishers
?
?
?Coordinating Secretary to the former Defence Secretary, Harsha Lakshman Weeratunge,? ??in his statement confirms that the Defence Secretary granted approval to the Board?s decision to release money for the questionable construction.? ?
Meanwhile MP Chamal Jayantha Rajapaksa in his statement states that he knew nothing about the SLLRDC?s and Navy?s involvement in the construction, but added that only the land was given to construct the museum and the monument in respect of what D.A. Rajapaksa had done for the? ?people of Giruapattuwa.? ?However,??Nandasena Gotabhaya Rajapaksa? ??had stated that it was on his recommendation, that???Harshan de Silva? ?was appointed as the Chairman SLLRDC and that on his request, the structural drawing was shown to Mahinda and Chamal Rajapaksa and it was? ?afterward that this construction work had been started. He further states that he knew about the SLLRDC?s Board decisions regarding the project, but had never given his approval to the decision. He further states that it was the responsibility of the SLLRDC officials to enter into an agreement with the Foundation and to obtain the advance payment of 20% of the estimated cost.
??According to him at the time he was giving his statement to the FCID he had already paid Rs.25 million to the SLLRDC and the balance would be settled by the D.A. Rajapaksa Foundation.
?Development Officer Weeraketiya Pradeshiya Sabha, Anthonige Gunathilaka? ?in his statement had said that approval hadn?t been obtained from them for the Weeraketiya Project, hence it is an illegal construction. Deputy Chairman D.A.Rajapaksa Foundation Upul Ranjith Samarasinghe? ?says that the Foundation did not have any discussions with the SLLRDC regarding the construction nor had they make a written request to the SLLRDC nor did they enter into an agreement.?
?
?
Gotabhaya Rajapaksa responds<U+200B>
?When a text message was sent to Gotabhaya Rajapaksa seeking a comment, he replied stating that this newspaper should contact the former Chairman SLLRDC to obtain a comment.? ?
?I am out of the country. Please contact Harshan de Silva former Chairman SLLRDC. He can give a comment,? Rajapaksa said in his text message.? ?Although Harshan de Silva was contacted thereafter, he wanted this newspaper to call him the following day to make an appointment with him for a reporter to meet him.? ?
However, as requested, when calling De Silva the following day, he did not answer any of the calls nor respond to the text message sent to him.? ?Present Chairman SLLRDC Asela Iddawala when contacted said that there wasn?t any board resolution to recover the money from the Rajapaksa Foundation, but they wished to recover the money from well-wishers.? ?
?Although the initial estimate, stated in the board minutes, was Rs.33.9 million, it rose to Rs.64.808 million later because on many occasions, the constructions at the project site had to be demolished on the request of the members of the foundation. This was done whenever they wanted to give a face lift to the site. This cost nearly doubled in comparison to the estimated cost. We have all the records of the demolitions and the bills to prove the new purchases. With the presence of Government taxes, this went up to Rs.81.313 million and it is unfair for them to claim that they are liable to pay only the initial estimated price,? Iddawala said.? ?

Decision to register SAITM graduates, politically influenced: MFSAC
	
The Sri Lanka Medical Council?s (SLMC) purported internal decision to register the SAITM graduates following a nine months clinical training was not an independent decision but a politically influenced one, Medical Faculty Students? Action Committee (MFSAC) Convener Ryan Jayalath said today.
Addressing a press conference he said the decision clearly showed that the SLMC had become a cat?s paw of the present Government.
He said the recent SLMC view on the subject is contradictory to its previous stance.
?In 2015 the SLMC observation team on SAITM issuing a report revealed the shortcomings in the institute. However, all of a sudden in 2017 a new report has been released stating now everything is good. How could this be possible without any changes being made in SAITM or Neville Fernando Hospital,? Jayalath questioned.
He charged that the government had appointed a pro government person as the SLMC head to get their job done.
Mr. Jayalath added that anti-SAITM forces would not hesitate to politically expose the government during the upcoming election campaign if it failed to fulfil the given promise on abolishing the SAITM. (Thilanka Karunarathna)

The GMOA today warned that the government's future was at stake if SAITM was not abolished as promised.
GMOA Assistant Secretary Naveen de Zoysa said they would resort to trade union action if the government attempted to use short cuts to register ?bogus degree holders?.
He said the next week would be critical to the government and the ministers if they failed to keep their word and pointed out that if the government continues with its double standards the GMOA would resume its countrywide anti-SAITM fight.
Dr. De Zoysa said the government should abolish SAITM and then decide what is to be done with the students.
He said said some ministers with the help of some Deans of the medical faculties were attempting to politicise the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) but GMOA would not allow the minimum standards in the health service to be destroyed. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

How Deforesting is Killing An Island's Natural Heritage
	
Carrying out resettlement projects around the Wilpattu National Park has proved to be a short-sighted, unsuccessful decision
?
?
A petition filed against these practices stated that an area of 2000 hectares adjoining the Wilpattu National Park has been cleared
	Upon clearing, 1500 families were allegedly settled by Minister of Industry and Commerce Rishad Bathiudeen
	Currently, 650 acres of land have been cleared to resettle people and it has been found that 706 plots of land have been cleared
?
Changing ecosystems have become a tough challenge to face. While there?s a need to restrict global warming, increasing population figures and other external factors prevent these attempts. Although Sri Lanka has numerous national parks, forest reserves and sanctuaries- protected under various acts and ordinances- these areas too have faced various man-made threats. As deforestation became a major concern with the approaches taken to settle illegally around the Wilpattu National Park, the weak laws and acts printed in statute books remained unchanged. On another contradictory note, Sri Lanka also signed the Paris Agreement for Climate Change in April 2016 thus joining a list of countries to follow an action plan to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.??
Hence, the sheds light on the current situation at the Wilpattu National Park and threats identified due to massive deforestation practices.??
?
Wilpattu?National Park??
The Wilpattu National Park has been in the news for the past couple of years due to the rapid deforestation practices that took place in its surrounds. Forest reserves including Kallara, Madu and Periyamadu were severely deforested for these purposes. A petition filed against these practices stated that a vast area of 2000 hectares in the forest complex adjoining the Wilpattu National Park has been cleared in addition to another 1000 hectares in several other forest reserves. Upon clearing, 1500 families were allegedly settled by Minister of Industry and Commerce Rishad Bathiudeen under the pretext of resettlement for internally-displaced people.??
Currently, 650 acres of land have been cleared to resettle people and it has been found that 706 plots of land have been cleared while 131 houses are partly being constructed.??
Evidence-based scientific research has clearly shown that forests and forested watersheds play a crucial role in mitigating natural disasters. Forests therefore act as giant sponges, absorbing rainfall, thus ensuring a sustained supply of water during the dry season. Therefore with deforestation and other malpractices, droughts and floods should be expected.??
?
Vehicles travelling at unregulated speeds and killing wild animals, haphazard dumping of polythene and other forms of garbage and people alighting from vehicles to engage in illegal activities are some of the threats that have been identified
Threats identified?by EFL??
According to the research conducted by Environmental Foundation Limited (EFL), a non-profit public interest law group committed to securing Sri Lanka?s environmental rights, several threats have been identified. They include:??
?
Deforestation in the Kallaru (Marchchikaddi-Karadakkuli) Veppal and Villaththaikulam forest reserves for new human settlements in the guise of resettlement. There is evidence to show that the Forest Department recommended the release of 770 acres and a 650 acres land, but procedures were not followed for the releasing of these lands. Forest clearing is still underway in violation of the Forest Ordinance (FO).? There is an illegal road across the Wilpattu National park that has violated the Fauna and Flora Protection Ordinance (FFPO). Soon after the war, two roads, cut through the park, were opened for public use. The coastal road has been abandoned. But the other road from Eluwankulam to Pukulum is used with no regulations imposed on the activities inside the park. Vehicles travelling at unregulated speeds and killing wild animals, haphazard dumping of polythene and other forms of garbage and people alighting from vehicles to engage in illegal activities are some of the threats that have been identified.??
?
The Pallekhandal Church is located within the Wilpattu National Park. Claiming customary rights and traditional use, the catholic church is said to have expanded its operations; enhancing both its physical structures and activities. The rules and regulations that govern national parks are flouted.
?
A Private farm has encroached into the Tabbowa Sanctuary and Weerakkodicholai Forest Reserve in the Eluwankulam area. Despite the illegal encroachments that took place in the early and mid-2000s, the Government has handed over 175 acres of forest land from the sanctuary and forest reserve to the Private farming project without adhering to a proper procedure. The land has been handed over violating the FFPO and the FO. Prior to this latest land violation, employees of its parent company had allegedly cleared 35 acres from these reserves and from the Raalmaduwa - Achchimale archaeological reserve to carry out a pilot project for fruit cultivation.
	Unregulated tourism activities are taking place in the Gangewadiya area, Kala Oya, in the buffer zone of Wilpattu National Park, with construction taking place along the river reservation. Some of these operations are being carried out with the patronage of the local Governmental authorities.
	Plans are being drawn to issue permits for permanent structures/houses in the Pookulam fishing village within the WNP.?
?
Marine resources including the bar reef and species like dugongs are exposed to destruction or local extinction due to unregulated activities. Most of the Bar Reef sanctuary is ?dead? and unless urgent measures are taken, Sri Lanka?s largest marine reserve will be lost.?
?
?
There is evidence to show that the Forest Department recommended the release of 770 acres and a 650 acres land, but procedures were not followed for the releasing of these lands.?
No deeds for houses? 
The? learned that many houses have already been built within two kilometres of the buffer zone at the Wilpattu National Park. In his comments, Chamath Lakshman, Park Warden at the National Park said that the houses have been built within the Kallara Forest Reserve. Although people have settled in these houses they do not possess deeds. ?Some of the houses are yet to be given away to the people, but right now most of them (houses) look as if they have been abandoned altogether,?he said.?

India seeks Interpol?s help for red sanders? smugglers hiding in SL
	
The Crime Investigation Department (CID) in Andhra Pradesh will take the help of the Interpol to extradite the wanted red sanders smugglers hiding in different countries including Sri Lanka, Nepal, Singapore and Myanmar, the Hindu reported.
?CID, which is the nodal agency for Interpol in the State, is trying to bring the notorious smugglers wanted in red sanders cases in different police stations,? said CID Additional Director-General of Police Ch. Dwaraka Tirumala Rao.
??The Anti-Smuggling Task Force is doing a great job in protecting the red sanders plantations in Chittoor, Kadapa, Anantapur districts in the State. Task Force teams headed by IG M. Kantha Rao arrested some thousands of smugglers, but some were hiding in different countries,? the Additional D-G said.
The CID police were entrusted to extradite the wanted red sanders smugglers, who are following up the cases filed against the smugglers in various law and order police stations. About 30 notorious smugglers were hiding in China, Malaysia, Dubai, Abu Dhabi, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Singapore and Myanmar.
?Already we issued red corner notices and a team met the Interpol personnel. We will meet the Interpol police again to extradite the smugglers of other countries,? Mr. Tirumala Rao told The Hindu.
Mr. Kantha Rao said that 25 international smugglers were already arrested when they visited the country to make hawala transactions, check the quality of the stocks and hold talks with the local parties. ?Still 30 more international smugglers are wanted and we sought the cooperation of the CID and the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) to arrest them,? Mr. Kantha Rao said.

LG Polls- Govt. will strictly uphold election laws: PM
	
The government will do its utmost to conduct the February 10 elections in accordance with election laws, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremeisnghe said today.
The Prime Minister said this soon after signing the proposal to table the gazette notification on media ethics in Parliament.
The guidelines to be adhered to by media institutions were prepared by the Elections Commission.
?Government is committed to holding the local government elections under election laws and that is why we welcomed this proposal. The elections will be conducted under the new electoral system where a nomination list has to consist of 25 per cent women candidates and the people would be able to elect their representative to each of the wards,? he said.
The ethics to be adhered to include the need to act impartially by giving equal space to all political parties; electronic media are barred from broadcasting print media editorials; TV news presenters are banned from making personal comments; to consider the coverage given to the President or the Prime Minister as a coverage given to the political party he or she belongs to and no special or favourable treatment given to any candidate.
When it comes to electronic media panel discussion, the respective channels have been asked to select the participants in a responsible manner. Journalists have been asked to inform the management of his or her institution if such a participant engages in election campaigning. The participant must not actively engage in the duties assigned to him in such media institutions and a person who is a candidate or holding office in a party in the fray should not moderate any political talk show or panel discussion. In the case of print media such person shall not publish his own political articles through that media institution.
Where any participant of a political party refuses to participate in a discussion or an interview in any media institution without assigning any reason for such non-participation, such media institution shall not display an empty chair or create other similar dramatic situations to emphasize such non-participation. It is recommended that a simple and direct announcement be made about the absence of the participant. (Yohan Perera)

## Title: Management of step-in risk in banks

Management of step-in risk in banks
	
The growth of the global banking system is a function of synergy between banks and non-bank entities. They coexist and complement the role to support the growth of the economy. As a result, many times, banks have to enter into dealings even with less regulated/unregulated financial entities.?
Alternatively, the prime customers of banks may in turn be in business league with such entities transmitting their inherent risks on to banks. The experience of global financial crisis in 2008, leading to the collapse of Lehman Brothers, indicated that interdependency of banks on non-bank fragile financial entities led to the crystallization of systemic risks that eventually led to its dubious collapse.?
As a consequence, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision aimed to evolve an appropriate framework in October 2017 to mitigate the potential spillover effects from such interconnectedness between the banking system and financial entities forming part of a shadow banking system.?
The Bank for International Settlement (BIS) terms such non-bank entities as unconsolidated entities, defined as a non-bank unit not falling within the scope of the regulatory consolidation. According to the Basel Committee framework, the regulatory consolidation includes all banking and relevant financial entities meeting the prescribed regulatory criteria of the central bank. The existence of such informal financial constituencies in any economy cannot be ruled out.?
The financial intermediation by such entities leads to shadow banking. Since banks have to coexist in such systems, it is more important to be able to apprehend and manage such risks. Since they are not compliant to the regulatory dispensation, they tend to be riskier.?
Shadow banking
Thus, the shadow banking system is business done by a set of institutions that carry out the functions very similar to those of traditional banks but that are largely unregulated. They perform the same kind of maturity transformation traditionally performed by commercial banks.?
Thus, the shadow banking system, despite its somewhat unwholesome sounding name, provides a useful service to society. Thus, shadow banking is not necessarily a bad thing. The problem is that, under certain circumstances, these financial institutions can become fragile ? that is, subject to panics professing incomprehensible risks to regulated entities.
An important fact about the shadow banking system is that it has grown significantly in the last 30 years. It is estimated that just before the financial crisis of 2007-08, the assets of the shadow banking system began to grow as fast as the assets of commercial banks. Thus, informal and unaccounted financial intermediation began to add to risks.?
Another important fact about the shadow banking system is that it has grown outside the oversight of regulators. As banking and finance in general have expanded in recent decades, part of that growth has occurred in the shadow system, largely to avoid the costs associated with regulation.
Global surge in volumes
The Financial Stability Board (FSB) measures shadow banking as ?credit intermediation involving entities and activities (fully or partly) outside of the regular banking system?. Some authorities and market participants prefer to use other terms such as ?market-based finance? instead of shadow banking. The use of the term shadow banking is not intended to cast a pejorative tone on this system of credit intermediation.?
However, the FSB uses the term shadow banking as this is the most commonly employed and in particular, has been used in earlier G20 communications. According to its Global Financial Stability Report ? 2016, out of the total global financial assets of US $ 321 trillion (based on the data from 27 jurisdictions and Euro area representing 80 percent of global GDP), the volume of shadow banking assets are put at US $ 34 trillion as of end-2015.?
The data only provides an inkling of emerging trends of share of shadow banking as a global phenomenon. No economy, including the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) nations, of which Sri Lanka is a member, cannot be completely immune from the shadow banking practices. Thus, banks operating in different economies will have to be aware of the risks but need not necessarily be averse to such risks.?
It needs to be better managed by understanding its nuances. Wherever non-bank financing is involved in bank-like activities, transforming maturity/liquidity and creating leverage like banks, it can become a potential source of systemic risk, both directly and through its interconnectedness with the banking system. Such risk is broadly associated with ?step-in risk?.
Step-in risk
It is the risk when a bank decides to provide financial support to a shadow banking entity that is facing stress, in the absence of, or in excess of, any contractual obligations to provide such support. The main reason for step-in risk might be to avoid the reputational risk that a bank might suffer were it not to provide support to an entity facing a stress situation.
Indeed, the experience of past financial crisis provided enough evidence that a bank might have incentives beyond contractual obligation or equity ties to ?step-in? to support such non-bank financial entities to which it is connected.?
In this context, the Basel Committee defined reputational risk that automatically emanates from step-in risk. In fact, it is effectively the risk arising from negative perception on the part of customers, counterparties, shareholders, investors, debt-holders, market analysts, other relevant parties or regulators that can adversely affect a bank?s ability to maintain existing or establish new business relationships and continue access to sources of funding.?
As such, step-in risk is associated with a possible source of reputational risk as well. It arises when a bank considers that it is likely to suffer a negative impact from the weakness or failure of an entity and concludes that this impact is best mitigated by stepping into provide financial support to bail out the entity.
Mitigation of step-in risk
The central bank and banks in the ecosystem mutatis mutandis endeavour to ring fence the financial system against such precipitating risks. It is more important for individual banks to be aware of the risks associated with shadow banking and those transmitted from the financial derivatives.?
The systemic controls have to be more robust in dealing particularly with risky investment products, financial pawnshops and loan shark operations and informal peer to peer lending that is not adequately insulated by the regulatory authorities. The common narrative is that these products and practices thrive outside the regular banking system threatening the safety and soundness of financial architecture.?
In developing economies, the market players have to be mindful about the step-in risk and its impact on the stability of banks and financial entities. Shadow banking proliferates for a reason: free from regulation, funds flow to where it is needed but can jeopardize the interest of regulated entities like banks.?
Hence, it may not be possible not to deal with non-bank entities creating shadow banking but what is more important is to be aware of the extent of step-in risk and take appropriate preventive measures, more so when the financial system is on upsurge to support the burgeoning economies.?

Parking garage fire destroys roughly 1,400 of cars in UK
	
DAILY MAIL, 01st JANUARY, 2018- An estimated 1,400 cars were destroyed in a huge fire that raged through a multi-storey parking garage in the northern English city of Liverpool.
The fire next to Liverpool?s Echo Arena also threatened horses that were stabled in the garage for performances at the Liverpool International Horse Show.
The horses were moved to safety inside the arena. The popular horse show was cancelled because of the fire, which was brought under control early Monday morning. The charred remains of ruined vehicles were visible in the seven stories of the parking garage.
There were no reported injuries in the blaze. Officials set up an emergency shelter to help the many people who could not get home because their cars had been burned.
Fire officials said two dogs were rescued from vehicles parked in the structure. They are believed to have been the only animals inside cars at the time.
The Echo Arena said all people and horses were safe.
Witnesses said cars seemed to explode every couple of seconds when the fire was at its peak. They said the fire appeared to start in the engine of an older Land Rover and quickly spread.

Parliament will have more ageing MPs in 2018
	
Sri Lanka will see more ageing MPs in Parliament in 2018 as most of them will be 70 years during this year while only a few others will be nearing that age, parliamentary sources said.
As per the data of the official website of Sri Lankan Parliament, three Members of Parliament will reach the age of 70 years in 2018. As a result the total number of MPs who had reached the age of 70 years in Sri Lankan Parliament will exceed 20 in number this year.
In addition three more MPs will reach 69 years as per the website while four MPs will reach 65 years.
This would mean that one ninth of the total MPs would be more than 70 years of age when the term of the present Parliament expired in 2020.
However this would be only a fraction of a huge problem that Sri Lanka faces with the gradual increase of its ageing population of 2.5 million in 2012 which was 12.5 percent of the population, while it is expected to increase up to 16.7 percent in 2021. A quarter of the Sri Lankan population will be ageing by the year 2041, it is said.(Yohan Perera)

Saudi Arabia and UAE introduce VAT for first time
	
Value Added Tax (VAT) has been introduced in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates for the first time, BBC reported.
The 5% levy is being applied to the majority of goods and services.
Gulf states have long attracted foreign workers with the promise of tax-free living.
But governments want to increase revenue in the face of lower oil prices.
The tax kicked in on 1 January in both countries.
The UAE estimates that in the first year, VAT income will be around 12 billion dirhams (?2.4bn; $3.3bn).
Petrol and diesel, food, clothes, utility bills and hotel rooms all now have VAT applied.
But some outgoings have been made exempt from the tax, or given a zero-tax rating, including medical treatment, financial services and public transport.
Organisations such as the International Monetary Fund have long called for Gulf countries to diversify their sources of income away from oil reserves.
In Saudi Arabia more than 90% of budget revenues come from the oil industry while in the UAE it is roughly 80%.
Both countries have already taken steps to boost government coffers.
In Saudi Arabia this included a tax on tobacco and soft drinks as well as a cut in some subsidies offered to locals. In the UAE road tolls have been hiked and a tourism tax introduced.
But there are no plans to introduce income tax, where most residents pay 0% tax on their earnings.
The other members of the Gulf Co-operation Council - Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, and Qatar - have also committed to introduce VAT, though some have delayed plans until at least 2019.

The irate employee had asked the woman executive present not to allow the young girls to ?misbehave? in the garden. However, the woman executive had said there was nothing wrong with the behavior of the girls and they had a right to enjoy themselves freely on the occasion. However, heated exchange had ensued which ended with the employee hitting the woman executive with a bottle.?

Ten dead in overnight Iran unrest as Rouhani strikes defiant note

Ten people were killed overnight in the worst violence yet seen in Iran?s protests, local media reported on Monday, while President Hassan Rouhani said the Iranian people would respond to ?rioters and lawbreakers?.
Six people were killed in the western town of Tuyserkan after shots were fired, state television reported, while a local lawmaker said two people had been shot dead in the southwestern town of Izeh.
Two others, included a teenage boy, were run down and killed by a fire engine stolen by protesters in the western town of Dorud, the state broadcaster said, bringing the total death toll in four days of protests to 12.
Rouhani played down the unrest, saying: ?This is nothing.?
?Criticism and protest are an opportunity not a threat. The nation will themselves respond to the rioters and lawbreakers,? he said in a statement on the presidency?s website.
?Our nation will deal with this minority who chant slogans against the law and people?s wishes, and insult the sanctities and values of the revolution.?
The authorities did not give details on who was responsible for the fatal shootings.
Videos spread on social media of demonstrations in several towns and cities including Kermanshah, Khorramabad and Shahinshahr.
A school for clergy and government buildings were torched in the northwestern town of Takestan and videos showed police using tear gas and water cannon to disperse a small protest in Tehran?s Enghelab Square on Sunday evening.

We don?t mind President Sirisena using his sword against wrongdoers including the ones who responsible for allege deforestation in Pukkulam as requested by the environmentalists, as our hands are clean, State Minister of Irrigation Palitha Range Bandara said today.
Responding to the recent allegations leveled against him on deforestation in Pukkulam, the State Minister said he had done nothing illegal.
?We will face the sword fearlessly as we haven?t done anything illegal in Pukkulam,? he said.
The State Minister said none of the allegations leveled by the Ven.Pahiyangala Ananda Sagara Thera or the other environmentalists can be proven as no such deforestation has been carried out in the said area.
He also added that he didn?t mind even if he is taken to Hague as he could used the opportunity to complain against the NGO?s that make false allegations and expose their true colours.
Recently in a press briefing, Environmentalists led by Pahiyangala Ananda Sagara Thera charged that the State Minister Palitha Range Bandara was behind the alleged deforestation in Pukkulam which he had said is belonged to Wilpattu National Park.
However, State Minister denied the fact and said Pookulam is outside the boundary of the forest reserve. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)
