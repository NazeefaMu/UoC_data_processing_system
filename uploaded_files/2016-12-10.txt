Lankan peace process was not correct for Colombian case:  Santos
	
Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos, who will be handed this year?s Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts to achieve a peace agreement with the FARC guerrillas, says that although the Sri Lankan model was extensively studied they did not think it was the correct procedure for Colombia.
?Beginning with a ceasefire agreement in early 2002, for almost five years a series of peace talks, facilitated by Norway, took place between the Sri Lankan government and the LTTE. The Colombian President?s agreement with FARC put an end to 50 years of civil war.
Responding to a question by ?N.Sethu from NORWAY NEWS ? NIPS? at a press conference after arriving in Oslo on Friday for his acceptance of this year?s Nobel Peace Prize, President Santos said that each conflict has its own dynamics and its own conditions.
?We did not follow the Sri Lanka process in many respects.
We did not think it was the correct procedure for the Colombian case but we studied it,? he said. ?We studied it very much and we have been having past conversations with Sri Lanka about reintegration.?
The 65-year-old said that Colombia has very good experience with reintegration because they have reintegrated more than 58,000 combatants both from guerilla and paramilitary groups.
?And so I think we have some experience there and we have shared this with the Sri Lankan government.?
?We took from the different processes what we thought was applicable for Colombia,? he added. (Norway news)

PM, Sampanthan discuss constitutional reforms with MR
	
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, joined by Opposition Leader R. Sampanthan, met a joint opposition?s delegation led by former president Mahinda Rajapaksa yesterday and discussed constitutional reforms.
The meeting took place days after President Maithripala Sirisen assured the Tamil National Alliance (TNA) that he would ask the Prime Minister to discuss constitutional reforms with Mr. Rajapaksa who is now an MP representing the Kurunegala district .
JO parliamentary group leader Dinesh Gunawardane who also attended the meeting told Daily Mirror Mr. Rajapaksa did not agree to commit himself to anything in this regard because the government, as a coalition of different parties, was yet to come out with its stand on the proposed constitution.
He said the JO members who served in the subcommittees that worked out constitutional proposals raised concerns that their views were disregarded and noted that the JO would stand by the 14 proposals it had submitted earlier.
The protection of the country's unitary nature, the foremost place accorded to Buddhism and new electoral reforms are among the proposals submitted by the JO.
?We remain concerned over the non-recognition of the JO in Parliament despite it being the largest group in the opposition,? Mr. Gunawardena said.
JO MPs Lohan Ratwatte, Bandula Gunawardene, Vidura Wickramanayake and Shehan Semasinghe also attended the meeting. (Kelum Bandara)

Salary hike on MPs will further burden Treasury: President
	
President Maithripala Sirisena said yesterday though the Members of Parliament were not satisfied with their salaries, increasing their salaries would create a problem given the unfavourable situation in the Treasury. ?
He also said that his salary was also lesser than that of a Parliamentarian.
Bribery and Corruption is a major stumbling block when preparing feasibility reports, environment impact assessment reports, technical assessment reports, tender procedures and large scale development projects involving billions of rupees, President Maithripala Sirisena said. ?
He said the officials in charge were working hand in glove with some of the parties to the contract resulting in bribery and corruption.??
The President said nearly 50% of the public institutions were engulfed in corruption, mismanagement and fraud but when those crimes were exposed, the finger was pointed at the subject ministers.?
? ?Society talks so often of crimes, rapes and robberies, bribery and corruption committed by politicians and public officials but a debate on organized bribery and corruption was only a whimper despite the fact that bribery and corruption had a cancerous effect on the daily life of the people,? he said when delivering the keynote address at the inauguration of the 2016 National Summit on Anti Corruption held at the Hotel Taj Samudra yesterday.
The President said South Asian countries did not have a satisfactory record on eradicating bribery and corruption though most Western Countries had been able to do so because politicians and the officials were committed to eradicating such crimes as a policy matter.? ?
?There is a new trend among public officials where they refuse to place their signature to approve funds for Government functions. Their excuse is that they may be summoned by the FCID, the PRECIFAC or even the CID. This is a misconception. No official must be afraid to do what?s right. An experienced official should know what is right and what violates FRs and ARs,? he said. ?
?I am sad to say that recently, there was a move by the management of a prominent State institution to fix a CCTV system at its office to control bribery, corruption and thefts. The entire staff took to the street against the management preventing the setting up of the cameras. In another instance, a public official who was transferred was not assigned any responsibilities for more than one and half years because he was not ready to fall in line with other officials taking bribes. This is the organized bribery and corruption entrenched in our public life. Another retired official of the Bribery Commission told me that the previous political leadership and other ministers used the Bribery Commission to keep other members of the government under their thumb.?
The President said these negative and distressing attitudes by officials that led him to make certain comments at the SLFI on the activities of independent commissions that created a big uproar in the country. ?What I meant in that speech was the importance for public servants and public institutions, such as the Bribery Commission, the FCID, the CID, the Police or the PRECIFAC to be independent, impartial and right minded when performing their duties,? he said adding that the Government would be able to bridge the budget deficit if waste and corruption were eradicated and hoped the ?2016 National Summit on Anti Corruption would find a way to do that.
?The President said he decided to hold an anti corruption summit in Sri Lanka after he participated in the anti-corruption global summit in London on May 12 convened by the then British Prime Minister David Cameron.(Sandun A Jayasekera)

Strong winds, heavy showers expected as cyclone ?Vardah? intensifies
	
Strong winds and heavy showers were expected in the sea areas off the Northern and Eastern coast of Sri Lanka until 12th December due to the influence of the cyclonic storm ?VARDAH?, the Meteorology Department said today.
It said the cyclonic storm ?VARDAH? was now located around 800 km away from Trincomalee coast, to the north-east of Sri Lanka and it was likely to intensify further and move north-westward.
Due to the active cloudiness in the deep sea areas off the coast extending from Kankasanturai to Batticaloa via Trincomalee, sudden roughness of the sea areas associated with sudden increase of wind speed up to 70-80kmph was expected.
Naval and fishing communities were advised to be vigilant in this regard.
