ACCA Sri Lanka and Lanka BPO Academy team up to foster shared services industry
	

The Association of Chartered Certified Accountants (ACCA) has launched its Global Business Services (GBS) qualifications, a suite of three qualifications dedicated to finance and accounting in the shared services and GBS sector.
The syllabus specifically aims to introduce the learner to the business model of shared services and outsourcing, particularly in relation to financial operations, and how such models differ from and offer efficiency benefits over, traditional central function based service provision. It also aims to teach some of the key business skills needed in a GBS environment.
With Finance and Accounting having been identified as one of the key areas of excellence in the GBS sector in Sri Lanka, ACCA recently signed a strategic partnership with the Lanka BPO Academy,Sri Lankas pioneer and only BPO training center in the country.
The agreement entails the Lanka BPO Academy to offer ACCAs GBS (Global Business Services products) qualifications to strengthen and foster the finance talent in the GBS sector in the country and to enhance awareness among those interested to pursue a career in the GBS sector, in finance shared services.
This agreement was formalized at a signing ceremony, with the Head of ACCA Sri Lanka Nilusha Ranasinghe and Yasas Abeywickrama, Director of the Lanka BPO Academy.
The Head of ACCA Sri Lanka Nilusha Ranasinghe said, The GBS industry in Sri Lanka is on a trajectory for expansive growth, including in the finance and accounting services. Therefore, the ultimate aim of this partnership is to develop the accountancy and finance profession in the GBS sector in the country.
With many multinational and local companies establishing their GBS operations here and with over 200,000 new jobs slated to be available in the sector by 2022, there is no better time for our young talents to build a successful and rewarding career in Sri Lanka s GBS industry.
Yasas Abeywickrama, Director of the Lanka BPO Academy also underlined the significance of this collaborative agreement and added that it will be a major boost to the GBS Sector which has been identified as major player in the economic growth and transformational development of Sri Lanka.
There is a high demand for finance professionals in the GBS sector and this prestigious partnership will help to accumulate more accountants to further enhance their skills and gain knowledge in the adoption of global standards in finance. We look forward to working together with ACCA on the key initiatives identified in our partnership agreement and to utilize this strategic collaboration to ensure Sri Lankas feasibility and readiness to cater to an increased range of financial services under the GBS industry, and further solidify our position within the top most globally preferred locations for GBS.

Amana Bank September net profit falls over tax provisioning
	
Amana Bank PLC, Sri Lankas first non-interest based Islamic bank, saw its net profit for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 (3Q16) falling by 10.5 percent on year to Rs.45.3 million or 4 cents a share, as the bank shifted from its earlier practice of providing for income taxes at the end of the year to quarterly tax provision, the interim results showed.
The profit before tax for the same quarter was however rose by 24.2 percent Year-on-Year (YoY) to Rs.62.9 million.
The performance was supported by the core-banking operations as the banks net financing income (NFI) rose by a strong 40.6 percent to Rs.533.5 million from a year ago.
The banks financing and receivables or loans in general banking context rose by 13.8 percent or Rs.4.6 billion during the nine months while the deposits rose by 17.6 percent or Rs.6.8 billion.
As of September 30, the bank had a total financing and receivables base of little under Rs.38 billion while the deposits stood at Rs.45.4 billion.
The bank maintains a current and savings account (CASA) base of over 50 percent.
The net interest margin (NIM) remained unchanged at 3.6 percent during the nine months.
Amana Bank has an asset base of Rs.53 billion, which is a 10.8 percent increase from December 2015.
Amana Bank was among few small and mid-sized banks in the industry to receive the Central Bank nod this year for an extended time frame to raise its minimum core capital levels up to Rs.10.0 billion.
In July 2015 the Central Bank granted approval for the bank to increase its core capital up to Rs.7.5 billion by January 01, 2017 and further up to Rs.10.0 billion in a year later.
By September 30, 2016 the banks core-capital base stood at Rs.5.2 billion.
While doubling the existing capital base within a year itself appears to be a daunting task, it is still not known how Amana Bank would again double its capital up to Rs.20.0 billion if the Central Bank issues directive in that direction following the budget proposal to that effect.
Amana Bank has the backing of Bank Islam Malaysia Berhad, AB Bank in Bangladesh and The Islamic Development Bank based in Saudi Arabia who together account for 38.5 percent stake in the bank.
In October Fitch Rating Lanka affirmed the banks BB rating with a stable outlook but it largely on the expectation that the bank would stay in line with the capital enhancement plan agreed with the Central Bank.
The banks asset quality remains high as the gross non-performing loan ratio was at 0.93 percent.
Meanwhile, during the nine months ended September 30, the bank surpassed its Rs.100 million profit mark and posted a net profit of Rs. 101.5 million or 8 cents a share which is 16.3 percent less than a year ago.
However the profit before tax grew by 16.2 percent YoY to Rs.140.9 million. The NII rose by 29.5 percent YoY to Rs1.4 billion while the net fee and commission income grew by 20.7 percent on year to Rs.144.2 million.

Between a rock and a herd place
	
Monday's massive New Zealand earthquake caused major damage to urban areas, however some of the most destructive scenes occurred in the most remote areas of the country.
The enormous 7.8 magnitude earthquake not only tore apart major roadways, but also ripped some of the country's famed mountain areas to shreds.
So powerful was the quake that it caused one mountainside to separate entirely, leaving a family of cows stranded on a small island of grass.
Incredible video captured the cows standing helplessly on the mountainside atop the tiny island.
The group of three cows fortunately found themselves standing on a sturdy piece of land, saving their beef from the damaged and potentially dangerous earth below.
While there have been no specific reports of livestock deaths, there was widespread landslides across New Zealand.
One massive collapse of earth and rock covered a major road under tonnes of dirt, leaving it completely inaccessible to cars or emergency vehicles. (Daily Mail)

2017 Budget squeezing the necks of the poor: GL
	
The 2017 Budget as no vision other than including proposals to squeeze the necks of the poor, joint opposition member G.L. Peiris said today.
He said the proposal to increase the minimum penalty on traffic offences to Rs.2,500 had been temporarily withdrawn by the government while a proposal to restructure the Samurdhi as Jana Isuru had been introduced amid objections by the subject minister.
This is exactly what happened with the previous budget. It was subjected to many amendments and at the end there were only a few of the original proposals left, he told a news conference by the JO economic research centre.
Prof. Peiris however commended the proposal to provide Tabs to students but said it would be of little or no use because the government had increased internet charges.
Basic facilities provided to the students and schools should have been increased instead of providing Tabs which might not be used, he said.
Prof. Peiris said the government had increased indirect taxes to 75 per cent of the tax revenue. "The poor will be badly affected by the move and said the government should have imposed direct taxes on the elite class," he said and criticized the introduction of a fee when a person files a case in court and described the move as inhumane.
It is a human right to seek justice. From now on, if a person files a case expecting justice from the court when they are wronged, the government will impose a charge to deliver justice, he said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

## Title: Central Banks autonomy challenged in budget 2017

Central Banks autonomy challenged in budget 2017
	
Certain controversial proposals in the budget 2017 are likely to have massive implications on the countrys financial system and the independence of the Monetary Board (MB) of the Central Bank, according to a leading economist in the country.
The 2017 budget, which was presented to parliament last week, proposed to set up a National Payment Platform (NPP) implemented by the state-run Information Communication Technology Agency (ICTA) to facilitate all government and private sector online/electronic transactions.
The ICTA will also implement the National Payment Platform (NPP), which will facilitate persons, businesses and government to make peer-to-peer payments, including fund transfers and online payments for goods and services, using computing devices, including mobile devices, Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake said.
According to economist and former Central Bank Deputy Governor W.A. Wijewardena, this is a clear case of the countrys finance minister trying to interfere in a massive scale, with the responsibilities of the Monetary Board of the Central Bank.
The Central Bank was established in 1950 to decide on the countrys monetary and banking policies independently without any interference from politicians. The payment system is the responsibility of the Monetary Board of the Central Bank, Wijewardena told a post-budget forum in Colombo, organised by the University of Sri Jayewardenepura, last Friday.
The reason is that, when we make an electronic payment we should be satisfied that the payment we make reaches the person or institution we intended to,he added.
For example, I pay taxes through cheques. So, when I make such payments, I need to be sure that my money goes to the account of the Director General of the Inland Revenue Department and not to an account in Nigeria or somewhere, Wijewardena quipped.
He reiterated that the payment system of the country should be designed and handled by the Monetary Board of the Central Bank. The Central Bank in collaboration with LankaClear, the national payment infrastructure provider, is said to be currently working on the countrys national payment system called Sri Lanka Payment Gateway.
Wijewardena, who is also a widely-read newspaper columnist on economic matters, disapproved the finance ministers high-handed approach towards trying to indirectly regulate the countrys banking sector, a duty that clearly falls under the Central Bank as the banking industry regulator.
Banks should be regulated by the Central Bank. The finance minister says Ive taken a decision to increase capital for banks. I dont believe this sets a good precedent, he remarked. In what appeared to be an apparent attempt to push the banking industry to consolidate, Karunanayake in the budget 2017 proposed to double the minimum core capital level of the banking sector to Rs.20 billion from the current Rs.10 billion.
Such consolidation of banks will enhance the size of the banks, facilitate the fund raising from diversified sources, enhance risk taking capacities and enable banks to participate in large state and private sector projects to a greater degree than at present and derive scale benefits with regard to operational costs, he said.
The Central Bank under the Mahinda Rajapaksa administration launched a programme to consolidate the countrys banking sector by force but it was abandoned by the Sirisena-Wickremesinghe government, who said mergers and acquisitions in the banking sector should take place voluntarily. 
Wijewardena also criticized the finance ministers move directing banks to lend to priority areas of the economy. 
This is not a job of the finance minister but of the Monetary Board of the Central Bank. For so many years the Central Bank has been asked to direct banks to provide loans to priority areas. India has been doing this since 1948. But after looking at them we decided we shouldnt do it, Wijewardena said.
However, in 2004, an amendment was brought into Sri Lankas Monetary Law Act, directing the banking sector to lend 10 percent of its lending portfolio to the agricultural sector.
The banks havent been able to do that. The plan was for farmers to get these loans. But when you say agriculture, it also includes plantation industry, he pointed out.
Interestingly, the budget 2017 calls for banks to lend 50 percent of its loan portfolio to priority areas. 
I direct banks to ensure that at least 10 percent of their lending portfolio is for agriculture, 10 percent for SME (small and medium-scale enterprises), 10 percent for exports, 10 percent for tourism, 5 percent for youth and 5 percent for women, Karunanayake said in his budget speech.
Wijewardena reminisced his days as Director of Rural Credit at the Central Bank and brought in an anecdote to show the ineffectiveness of such policy decisions.
When I was Director of Rural Credit at the Central Bank, we asked the banks to give loans to small businesses. So the banks said they had lent to over 600 small-sized rice mills. We knew this was impossible as Sri Lanka didnt even have so many rice mills.
But the files of these loans with the banks even contained photographs of these mills. So I had to visit these rice mills in person to uncover the truth. As you may have guessed most of the addresses didnt have rice mills, he remarked.
Meanwhile, making what appears to be a community reinvestment proposal, Karunanayake directed the banks to lend at least 15 percent of their deposits within the same areas they were raised for business development.
This is a business decision the banks should take and not one to be taken by the finance minister. The job of the finance minister is to make the people in these areas eligible to borrow, Wijewardena noted
Under these circumstances, if banks couldnt find people qualified to borrow, what will eventually happen is, the relatives and friends of the bank managers will get loans, he quipped. The finance ministers move to recommend to the Credit Information Bureau (CRIB) to not provide credit history of those creditors with a cumulative loan size up to Rs.500,000, also drew criticism during the forum, which was attended by academics, politicians and university students.
As Wijewardena pointed out, the CRIB only provides records about borrowings and the banks have the discretion to take those records into consideration in their decision-making process to provide loans to creditors.
When we started the cap was Rs.25, 000 but then we brought it down to 5000 because a lot of microfinance loans go unpaid, Wijewardena, who was the first General Manager of the CRIB, said.

Debt Office: JO to file action in Supreme Court
	
The joint opposition said today it would file action in the Supreme Court with regard to the budget proposal to set up an Independent Debt Office at the General Treasury.
MP Bandula Gunawardane said it was the Central Bank and not the Treasury which has the authority to monitor the countrys debt control.
The proposed debt office will be directly responsible for managing the countrys domestic and foreign debt and that of the debt stock. This move will only aggravate our fiscal plight, he told a news conference.
The MP said the authority of the Central Bank to monitor bank transactions had been snatched through another proposal so as to hand it over to a National Payment Platform (NPP).
These are the moves to privatise the Central Bank. We will write to the President and the Prime Minister about this matter while filing a case in Supreme Court, he said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

NDB group 3Q net slightly up over core banking but 9-month profit falls
	
The National Development Bank PLC (NDB) group saw its net profits for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 (3Q16) increasing by 4.5 percent to Rs.881.9 million or Rs.5.34 a share from a year ago as net interest income (NII) rose amid margins coming under pressure and slowing growth in loans, the interim results showed.
The NDB share ended Rs.1.30 or 0.82 percent higher at Rs.160 at last Fridays market close.
The group NII rose by 20.8 percent Year-on-Year (YoY) to Rs.2.29 billion when the net interest margin (NIM) slipped to 2.62 percent from 2.63 percent at the start of the year.
On a standalone basis, the banks loans and receivables growth slowed to little under 6 percent or Rs.12.8 billion during the 9 months. The bank had a total loan book of Rs.227.8 billion by the end of September.
The growth in loans has slowed down as foreign currency loans came down by around Rs.6 billion due to settlements.
Among the portfolios, the rupee overdrafts grew by Rs.7.5 billion, housing loans by about Rs.1 billion and credit cards by about Rs.250 million.
The consumer loans remained static.
At a post-budget forum held last Friday, NDB Chief Executive Officer, Rajendra Theagarajah pointed out the limited discretion in extending loans as stipulated in the budget 2017 which could act against foreign and institutional interest in bank holdings.
The budget proposed that the banks should allocate up to 50 percent of their new lending to governments priority sectors such as agriculture, women entrepreneurship etc. In response, Finance Minister, Ravi Karunanayake said it is not mandatory but a request from the banking sector to channel funds into productive sectors in the economy as the banks take the easy route of channeling funds to less productive consumption activities.
The bank had an asset base of Rs.327. 3 billion, an increase
of 6 percent.
Meanwhile, the banks deposit base grew by 4.7 percent or just Rs.8.7 billion. It appears that NDB had met with fierce competition
for deposits from other banks during the period.
The low cost deposits measured by the current and savings account (CASA) ratio dropped to 23.2 percent from 25.6 percent nine months ago.
The bank said the improvement in the CASA would remain a key focus going forward.
The net fee and commission income slipped by 1.5 percent YoY to Rs.739.6 million due to weak income from the groups capital market cluster. 
During the quarter, the banking group made less provisions for possible bad loans due to provision reversal from general provisions, but total provisions for the nine months rose by 93 percent to little over Rs.1.0 billion mainly due to provisions made against
few customers.
The gross non-performing loan ratio edged up to 2.44 percent from 2.43 percent in December 2015 but remained below the industry average of 3.0 percent.
Meanwhile, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 the NDB group made a net profit of Rs.1.96 billion or Rs.11.90 a share which a 14 percent decline from a year ago. The NII for the nine months rose by 14 percent YoY to Rs.6.53 billion.
NDBs Tier I and Tier II capital adequacy ratios stood at 9.07 percent and 13.10 percent respectively against the regulatory minimums of 5 percent and 10 percent.
In a new development, during the three months to September 30, Perpetual Treasuries Limited, the primary dealer associated with a couple of controversial bond transactions, has accumulated up to 6.2 million shares equivalent to 3.73 percent stake becoming the 7th largest shareholder in the bank.
Further, a Perpetual group company, Perpetual Equities Private Limited had another 4.5 million shares or 2.73 percent stake accumulated through margin trading provided by Union Bank of Colombo PLC, bringing the total stake held by the Perpetual group
up to 6.46 percent.
At the current market value of Rs.160 a share, this 6.46 percent stake could be valued at
Rs.1.71 billion.
The government had little over 30 percent stake in the bank through Bank of Ceylon, Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation and Employees Provident Fund.

People will have to pay for their treatment from government hospitals when such wards are built at State hospitals, he said.
Mr. Jayagoda said the total benefit which the people would receive through this budget is Rs 250. The price of a gas cylinder has been reduced by Rs.25, green gram by Rs.15, potatoes and sprats by Rs.5 and sugar by Rs.2. The total benefit adds up to Rs.250. Therefore this budget is nothing but an eye wash, he said.
Mr. Jayagoda said giving free tabs will not reap any benefits in the wake of increased internet charges.
They boast of giving tabs free of charge. However. it will not be possible to browse the internet as the charges have been increased. Phone charges will rise as a result of the VAT increase and cash withdrawal from the ATMs will now be charged Rs.10. Only the police will benefit from the increased fine for traffic offences. People will be badly hit by the budget, he said.
Mr. Jayagoda said this government was continuing to do what the previous government did.
"The previous government was engaged in converting education and health into marketable commodities through taxation. The present regime pledged to change it all but instead is doing the same. Some communal minded lunatics such as Trump are trying to gain political mileage out of peoples frustration but we will defeat them. The budget will be passed somehow. But we will mobilize the people to change this system, he said. (Yohan Perera)

Prosperous Capital contributes to creating a sustainable microfinance sector
	
The world development indicators, from the World Bank report state that over 23 percent of the Sri Lankan population is living below the poverty line. To address this concern, Prosperous Capital Ltd (PCA) has taken the initiative to penetrate into urban and rural low-income customer segments and provide financial solutions to uplift their income level and living standards.
Its strategically placed branched network into untapped rural areas in Sri Lanka has awakened customer segments that have never been exposed to microfinance in the past. Currently, operating in 11 branches, PCA is strategically placed to cover locations islandwide and plans are also in place to expand by opening another 15 branches in the near future. PCA takes responsibility for creating wider benefits both within and around the business and endeavours to make a positive impact, which improves peoples livelihoods while protecting the environment.
The company believes in improving the lives of its clients and that improvement can come only when the right kind of social initiatives are put in place. Therefore, PCA has put in place a host of supportive social initiatives, which include entrepreneurship development, healthcare initiatives, environment protection and conversation, empowerment of community and ethics and values.
As a company following the triple bottom line concept, the goal is to maintain financial, social and environment performance through sustainable development. Hence, the companys vision is to create an opportunity for the rural people of Sri Lanka to achieve a life free from poverty, with dignity and purpose. PCA is willing to have many equals and share the pie more widely in order to build peoples capacity and build their ownership.
PCA considers the most important function in microfinance to be increasing a customer-centric culture that strengthens the ties between the organisation and the customer in numerous ways, including finding the right customers, which helps to grow the customer base as the company expands into new markets and work with new customer segments. Awareness creation programmes also help to achieve the social missions by making sure low-income clients are aware of the services available.
The company has a good reputation in the microfinance industry among both customers and stakeholders. This is mainly due to instant recognition, differentiation, reliability, word of mouth and goodwill.
PCA believes in going to the grass roots and driving change. It has selected a model of empowering communities to engage with mainly through providing basic infrastructure or necessities to enable them to improve their existence and enhance their performance.
PCA is the only ISO certified microfinance company in Sri Lanka. Prof. Prasanna Perera functions as Non-Executive Independent Director of the company and Madhawa Edussuriya is an Executive Director.

Reduce the tax on internet usage for students: WDJS
	
The 25 per cent internet charges should be reduced for schoolchildren and university students, a government minister told Parliament today.
Labour and Trade Union Relations Minister W.D.J. Seneviratne expressed these views during last mornings debate on the second reading of the budget.
"Internet is an information superhighway. A person who browses webpages could access any kind of information at any time. Therefore if some tax concession is given to schoolchildren and university students, it would be possible for the government to fulfil its objective of enhancing the knowledge of the youth and to create a knowledge-based society," he said.
However, the minister lauded the 2017 budget saying its proposals were aimed at increasing tax revenue and strengthen the economy. (Yohan Perera)

Reference to fraudster tabooed
	
A group of employees of an august institution who were recently at a meeting with the institutions white collar heavyweights had not been allowed to bring up for discussion a case of embezzlement of Rs.100 million from the institutions savings and thrift society.

Informed sources say that in an obvious attempt to shield the fraudster involved, the heavyweights had told the employees: Let us not talk about this case as it is already before courts.
The embezzler who was virtually running the affairs of the society all by himself had exploited the trust placed in him by the members of the society. It has come to light that the culprit had been diddling the society funds over the years and had also made gratuity payments from the society funds only to a select few on their retirement.

SLFP disassociates itself from 30% hike: Premajayantha
	
Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) yesterday dis-associated itself from the governments decision to increase water bills by 30 per cent.
Partys Research and Technology Minister Susil Premajayantha told Daily Mirror this proposal had been introduced outside the budget.
We have to discuss this matter. We were in the dark about it, he said.
When asked about the SLFP proposals incorporated in the budget, the minister said some of them had been incorporated with modifications.
We are agreeable to that, he said and added that the proposal to provide electronic tablets free of charge to schoolchildren would not serve the intended purpose in the wake of the government deciding to increase internet-usage charges.
Along with progressive proposals, there are some meaningless ones as well, he said. (Kelum Bandara)

Supervisory job brings him a fortune
	
Some guys have all the luck, they say. This person is, perhaps, one of them.
Our man was functioning as a security guard of a very high political authority when he was placed in charge of overseeing the construction work on a cricket stadium in the deep South. Lucky man! He had been able to put up a fully-fledged holiday resort of his own in the same area while supervising the stadium construction project.
This security officer had received a monthly allowance of Rs.150,000 from the national body committed to promoting the game for supervising the construction work in addition to his normal pay from the army, they say.

The Art of Remembering Everything
	
As you aware that having access to necessary information on the time we needed, enhances the productivity. Keeping track of information about the things that we really care about can be a time saving factor and sometimes it can be a life saver too!
We have an old-fashioned way of note taking. This process normally jotting down things in a piece of paper using a pen. Note-taking is the best and effective way not only for the enhancement of personal knowledge database but also, it boosts productivity on the go.
Ive seen people, most often complaining that they forget the source of something they found interested in web. Sadly sometimes they even lost the post-it note where they have written about that very source!
Is traditional pen and paper mechanism of note-taking outdated in modern age Not likely.
Pen and paper method is still known to be an only sensible solution of note-taking. I am pretty sure that you may have an exclusive way of note-taking using pen and paper in a productive manner.
But, when it comes to digital age, we have plenty of options that power the ubiquitous capture, which is not only helps to digital note taking but also your notes become indexable and searchable, which is infinitely useful. There are plenty of great ways come in handful to capturing notes in computer friendly digital form.
When I'm surfing Internet, I usually find myself taking quite a few notes. I keep track of ideas I want to follow up on, topics I want to read further about. I thought my note-taking may be on overdrive, but I found several tricks to capturing notes in an effective way so called digital way. Few free web applications are helping me to make the process of note-taking a lot smoother and easier. I'll list some smart ways you can use to capture notes not only in the Internet but also in daily life.
Google Keep
Since, I am a big fan of Google products, I've fallen in love with Google Keep because of the way it helps me to capture notes. With the Google Keep browser extension you can easily organize and classify your ideas on the on the go. The user interface is equipped with the new Material design concept. You can segmentize the notes with tag, colours and size. Its a convenient way to keep notes in an organized manner.
Google Inbox
Inbox is an alternative app for Google Mail app, is not an digital note-taking web application, but, it can make you more productive. How It is coming with a feature called reminder, which you can use to write down and organize your notes within your mail box. That is super convenient. Also, you can save your favorite links from the internet right inside your inbox using the Saving feature of the Google Inbox. Like Google Keep, Inbox comes with a browser extension too. You can use both Google Keep and Google Inbox and save lots of time on daily basis.
Evernote
I love Evernote (www.evernote.com), a well known organizational web application. Evernote is one of those applications that I use on daily basis. It makes its slogan, Remember everything, a reality. Capturing and organizing notes never been easier than ever before.
You can search through everything you have saved to your Evernote account. You can even save every search for future reference. But, the ability of search text within images, was an outstanding feature of Evernote. It scans any image and analyze it for any text contained in it. Sounds pretty cool haa.
Organizing the notes you gathered is the most important step in order to boost your productivity. Organizing the stuff on the go saves lots of time. Evernote comes with an amazing feature for organizing your stuff using tags.
Copy and pasting from the web is incredibly simple with Evernote, and once notes have been taken its also quite easy to organize, store and peruse your various work which makes it an excellent choice for being productive and being focused on the 'wants'.
With an Internet connection, you can simply access your saved notes and stuff from these three apps, anywhere in the world. With these applications, I am quite sure, you won't forget anything you want to keep remember with you. Give it a shot, you'll loved it.
By the way, are you ready to become a Rockstar Note taker and Yes, you can remember everything!

US may have committed war crimes in Afghanistan: ICC
	
There is a reasonable basis to believe that U.S. soldiers and intelligence agents committed the war crimes of torture and rape in Afghanistan, the chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court says in a report.
It is the first time the prosecutor has used such strong language to describe U.S. conduct in Afghanistan, and it increases the likelihood of a formal war-crimes investigation against the United States. A decision will be made imminently, the prosecutor said on Monday.
A formal war-crimes investigation against the United States would counter-balance the ICCs frequent prosecutions of African suspects. Three African countries have quit the court in recent weeks, saying it is biased against Africa. But an investigation of U.S. forces would provoke a furor in Washington. President-elect Donald Trump has often called for interrogation techniques such as waterboarding that are widely regarded as torture.
In addition to the alleged U.S. crimes, there is also a reasonable basis to believe Afghan security forces and Taliban insurgents committed war crimes, according to the report released on Monday by the chief prosecutor, Fatou Bensouda, who has been conducting a preliminary review for several years.
She said the torture by the Afghan police and intelligence agents has been so widespread that a state of total impunity persists. Even today, an estimated 35 per cent to 50 per cent of conflict-related detainees may be subjected to torture in Afghan detention facilities, she said.
Canadian activists and human-rights experts believe Canadian military conduct could also be investigated for possible war crimes if the ICC goes ahead with a full investigation, since Canadian troops allegedly transferred Afghan detainees to the Afghan security forces at a time when torture was common.
Foreign Affairs Minister Stphane Dion, in an interview with The Globe and Mail last week, would not comment on the possibility of the ICC investigating Canada for war crimes, but said he had confidence in the ICC as an institution. He said Canada would work with the court.
Most of the alleged U.S. war crimes were committed in the 2003 to 2004 period, in Afghanistan and in secret detention facilities operated by the Central Intelligence Agency, but some continued until 2014, the prosecutors report said.
These alleged crimes were not the abuses of a few isolated individuals, Ms. Bensouda said. Rather, they appear to have been committed as part of approved interrogation techniques in an attempt to extract actionable intelligence from detainees.
She said there is a reasonable basis to believe that the alleged U.S. war crimes were committed in furtherance of a policy or policies aimed at eliciting information through the use of interrogation techniques involving cruel or violent methods which would support U.S. objectives in the conflict in Afghanistan.
The United States is not a member of the ICC, but its soldiers and agents could be subject to the courts investigation because their alleged crimes were committed in Afghanistan, which is an ICC member.
In addition, the CIA is alleged to have tortured some Afghan detainees in secret detention facilities in Poland, Romania and Lithuania, which are members of the ICC, the prosecutors report said.
It said U.S. soldiers appear to have subjected at least 61 detained persons to torture, cruel treatment [and] outrages upon personal dignity in Afghanistan between 2003 and 2014, while CIA agents appear to have subjected at least 27 detained persons to torture, cruel treatment, outrages upon personal dignity and/or rape from 2002 to 2008 in Afghanistan, Poland, Romania and Lithuania.
The victims of the alleged U.S. torture were deliberately subjected to physical and psychological violence  committed with particular cruelty and in a manner that debased the basic human dignity of the victims, the prosecutor said.
Some victims reportedly exhibited psychological and behavioural issues, including hallucinations, paranoia, insomnia, and attempts at self-harm and self-mutilation. The gravity of the alleged crimes is increased by the fact that they were reportedly committed pursuant to plans or policies approved at senior levels of the U.S. government, following careful and extensive deliberations.
The Afghan security forces, meanwhile, allegedly committed crimes that were particularly gruesome and seemingly calculated to inflict maximum pain, the prosecutor said.
The alleged crimes had severe short-term and long-term impacts on detainees physical and mental health, including permanent physical injuries.
About 5,000 conflict-related detainees are still in Afghan government custody, and up to half are ill-treated, yet only two officials have ever been prosecuted for abusing detainees, the prosecutor said.(The Globe and Mail)

Wimal usually dodged his summons: FCID
	
The Police Financial Crimes Investigation Division (FCID) in a response to claims made by MP Wimal Weerawansa for summoning him on Poya Day to record a statement said they had no other option because the politician keeps dodging his summons saying he was busy with parliamentary affairs.
A senior officer said the FCID had no vested interest in harassing individuals by summoning them but was only carrying out their duties.
The MP was summoned on Poya Day to record a statement in connection with the misuse of some 12 vehicles belonging to the Presidential Secretariat and some 40 vehicles belonging to the then Ministry of Construction and Engineering Services during last year's presidential election.
The MP had told journalists outside the FCID that government leaders did not care about the religious significance of Poya Day. (Kurulu Koojana Kariyakarawana)
