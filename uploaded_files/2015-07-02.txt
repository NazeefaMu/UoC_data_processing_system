COPE report proves CB governor intervened in scam: JVP
	
The JVP today alleged it was clear from the written evidence in the Committee on Public Enterprises (COPE) report that Central Bank Governor Arjun Mahendran had intervened in the Central Bank Treasury bond issue.
Former JVP MP Sunil Handunneththi told a news conference that they had produced even the audio records of the agents to the COPE.
Mr. Handunneththi said if the government wanted to submit the COPE report to parliament, it could have done so but certain UNPers wanted to deter it being presented in parliament citing various reasons.
He said it was the JVP which revealed the inside trading of the Central Bank and that it should be discussed in parliament.
Mr. Handunneththi said it was only the Share market which was manipulated in the past but with this Bond issue even the bond market had been manipulated.
He said the Bank of Ceylon had bought Rs. 5 billion worth Treasury Bonds for the Perpetual Treasuries on just a phone call.
?The Central Bank incurred big losses due to this issue and the Bank of Ceylon also had incurred a loss as it could have bought those bonds itself being a registered bond agent,? he said.
Mr. Handunneththi said there had been such insider trading in the past as well and urged that the loopholes in the system be rectified so that such frauds would not happen in the future.(Ajith Siriwardana)

Central Bank Governor Arjuna Mahendran left the island even without passing over his liabilities to another official or informing relevant authorities, Bandula Gunawardena charged today.
?Reliable sources at financial institutions informed me on the sudden flight of the Central Bank governor on Saturday (27), the very next day of dissolving Parliament. Sources told me that Mr. Mahendran had not informed about his tour abroad to the Monetary Board untill Tuesday (30),? the former MP said.?? ?
He said it was not the standard procedure for a governor to leave the country without informing authorities including the Monetary Board and naming an official to make decisions on his behalf. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

Mid sea operation launched to seize narcotics vessel
	
	An offshore operation has been in progress for the past 48 hours, jointly conducted by members of the Sri Lanka Ports Authority, the Sri Lanka Navy and the Police Narcotics Bureau, to seize a gas carrier that had arrived off the shores of Kerawalapitiya with a suspected consignment of narcotics.
	Daily Mirror reliably learns that a vessel carrying liquid petroleum gas (LPG) for a leading private LPG distributor in the country had arrived in the sea off Kerawalapitiya on Tuesday.
	The vessel which was believed to have departed from a port in a leading Middle Eastern oil producing country had arrived in Sri Lankan waters and is currently stationed at the LPG unloading location in the sea off Kerawalapitiya, technically known as the Composite Buoy Mooring (CBM).
	The Police Narcotics Bureau, having received information that the ship was carrying a large stock of heroin, had launched the operation with the assistance of the SL Navy and Sri Lanka Ports Authority.
	The PNB had sought the Navy's assistance to reach the point, and the SLPA officials had accompanied them due to the legal implications of boarding and searching a foreign vessel at sea.
	The local agencies had reportedly surrounded the vessel but not succeeded in boarding it even upto last morning due to the prevailing rough sea.
	When contacted last night, police spokesman ASP Ruwan Gunasekara said that an operation was underway to thwart a possible attempt to smuggle narcotics into the country.
	PNB sources confirmed that a special team had been dispatched to the scene to investigate the matter.
	A special underwater pipeline buried in the seabed connected to the CBM conveys LPG from the vessel to the terminals of the LPG distributor in Kerawalapitiya. (Kurulu Koojana Kariyakarawana)

Maithri rejects MR
	
	President Maithripala Sirisena has apparently rejected to give nominations to former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, sources said. ?
The President has come under pressure against his leaning to give nominations to Mr. Rajapaksa, compelling the faction led by the latter to conduct round the clock meetings to sort out the matter at least by tomorrow.
A group of SLFP leaders including former President Chandrika Kumaratunga has exerted pressure on the President against any move to accommodate Mr. Rajapaksa on board to contest the General Election or to spearhead the election campaign. (Kelum Bandara)

MS to take final decision on MR today
	
		 		 
		 
			
President Maithripala Sirisena had reportedly told a UPFA party leaders meeting yesterday that he was not in favour of making former president Mahinda Rajapaksa the prime ministerial candidate or the group leader of the UPFA at the forthcoming general elections. However he had informed the UPFA party leaders that he would inform them whether former president Rajapaksa would be given nomination from the UPFA by 10.00 am today.
At the meeting, party leaders such as Dinesh Gunawardane, Vasudeva Nanayakkara,and Prof. Tissa Vitharana had insisted that Mr. Rajapaksa be nominated.
However, there were others who were opposed to it. The Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) seniors had expressed views for and against it. But the president remained non-committal, it is learnt.
Instead, the president had said he could not give a ruling on the matter at that time. He had said he would make an announcement by 10.00 am today after consulting his party. There seems to be a division within the group of SLFP MPs who took ministerial posts in the government of President Sirisena.
Meanwhile, speaking to Daily Mirror, Democratic Left Front leader Vasudeva Nanayakkara said the UPFA Party Leaders? meeting had been fruitless and frustrating.
He said the UPFA leaders had intended to work out nomination lists comprising members from both factions but there was no agreement.
Now, he said, the UPFA factions supportive of Mr. Rajapaksa would look to the next option -- to contest under a different symbol.
A group of SLFP leaders, including former president Chandrika Kumaratunga, had exerted pressure on the president to resist any move to accommodate Mr. Rajapaksa on board to contest the general elections or to spearhead the election campaign.
Yet, another faction comprising a sizeable chunk of the SLFP, is pressing for his nomination. The situation has placed the president in a precarious situation, being unable to take up a final position and make a formal announcement. Besides, a six member committee appointed by the SLFP Central Committee had recommended the nomination of Mr. Rajapaksa as a candidate. It is reliably learnt that three foreign missions, including one of a neighbouring country had pressured the president not to accommodate Mr. Rajapaksa.
The pro-Rajapaksa faction is hoping to receive the final decision of the president at least by today so that it can opt for the next alternative to contest the election. For that purpose, a political formation has been worked out under a different symbol.
Besides, some parties and groups that backed President Maithripala Sirisena at the January 8 Presidential Election have asked the president to declare his stance clearly by today, so that they too could work out alternate strategies to contest the election. For that purpose, these parties and groups are considering the swan symbol of the National Democratic Front.(Kelum Bandara)

Thajudeen?s phone records could not be retrieved
	
	Dialog Telekom PLC today asserted by an affidavit to a Colombo Magistrate that it could not provide telephone details pertaining to former Havelock?s Rugby Captain Wasim Thajudeen due to technical and practical limitation. Wasim Thajudeen died under suspicious circumstances in an accident in May, 2012.
	Senior Counsel Ranil Samarasooriya with Madhawa Wijeyasriwardane and Manjula Ranasinghe who appeared on behalf of the telecom company made this remarks to Colombo Additional Magistrate Nishantha Pieris.
	The Senior Counsel said due to technical and practical limitation the company could only provide telephone details only for a period covering the past three months.
	Senior State Counsel Dilan Ratnayake appearing for the CID for the prosecution contended that even though the company asserted that it could not provide some information for more than three months, still the company could provide information on the Emi numbers and the towers that encoded and decoded the messages to the parties. They sought Court to direct the Dialog mobile phone company to provide those details to the CID.
	Accordingly, Magistrate Pieris directed Dialog Telekom to provide whatever information it could to the CID and assist the investigations. However, the Magistrate said that the court cannot issue an order directing Telecom Company to provide information which is not in their system.
	He also directed the CID to study the affidavit filed in court and make representations if any on the affidavit in court on September 10 to act appropriately.
	Former Havelock SC captain Wasim Thajudeen was killed in a road accident in Colombo in May 2012.
	According to Police while Thajudeen was driving to the airport he had lost control of the car and crashed into the wall of Shalika Grounds on Park Road Narahenpita and exploded within seconds of the crash.
	Although police said the death was accidental, SSP Ajith Rohana on February 26 this year said it was suspicious. He said according to the JMO, his death could not have been due to natural causes. (TFT, LS)

Imminent MR faction exit a blessing for SLFP: Amunugama
	
	Alluding to a certain split within the SLFP led UPFA, Minister Sarath Amunugama said the SLFP felt the situation came as a miserable pleasure because the gap created by the Mahinda Rajapaksa faction's exit, could be filled with educated youth in the nomination lists at the upcoming Parliamentary elections.
	He said when Parliament was dissolved last Friday, the SLFP had 127 members in Parliament. The SLFP had initially decided to give nominations to all sitting SLFP MPs. Therefore, it would have been problematic for the party?s nomination board to accommodate all of them if the SLFP faction led by former President Rajapaksa remained with the SLFP led by President Sirisena.
	He said that young and educated youth, professionals and educated women have shown enormous enthusiasm to contest the poll under the SLFP grabbing the opportunity created by the void.
	However, Minister Amunugama stressed that discussions were still continuing to bring the two factions under one flag and contest the poll as a single front.
	Addressing the weekly news briefing at the SLFP head office, Minister Amunugama said there were many proposals to unite the divided SLFP with one group led by President Maithripala Sirisena and the other by former President Rajapaksa.
