Amaradeva the only  comparables are  Sunil Santha and Jothipala
	
Past the near meadows, over the
still stream,
Up the hill-side; and now tis buried deep
In the next valley-glades:
Was it a vision, or a waking dream
Fled is that music: 
Do I wake or sleep
~John Keats, Ode to a Nightingale
Quintus Horatius Flaccus known in the English-speaking world as Horace was the leading Roman lyric poet during the time of Augustus.Contemplative about art in general and painting in particular, he is recorded to have said as follows: A picture is a poem without words. A song well rendered by a master is a drama enacted without a depiction.
Amaradeva had many imitators but none came close to the mastery of voice
	Only two artistes I would dare to compare with the Master. One is Sunil Santha; the other is H. R. Jothipala
Amaradevas every song belongs in that rare category. It is not an easy task to talk about Amaradeva and his unmatched contribution to the Sinhalese culture and art without referencing the times and events of his era and his peers, if any, and other artists who happen to crowd a fairly challenging field. Amaradeva entered the field of music and song at a time when the standards of singing and music were deplorable. It was either Nadagam or dramatic style singing and straight copies from India, both Northern and southern. The singers too, except a very few like Devar Surya Sena and Ananda Samarakoon, were of South Indian origin. They wrote the lyrics in Tamil and sang out in Sinhala. What a travesty of culture! 
The socio-cultural environment that prevailed at the time did demand a pioneering voice, so to speak, to speak out, to throw away the rut and furrow of Sinhala-pretenders whose allegiance was not to a new culture of Sinhala song and music, but to a livelihood that earned them an income far below the level of their brethren in India, yet bragged that they were the pioneers of Sinhalese music and song. The backdrop was wretched yet hopeful and dreaming. It was dotted with scarce emergence of one or two genuine sounding artists who had the misfortune of disappearing from the milieu of the art for lack of listener-following and sponsors. Ananda Samarakoon was one such pioneer who made a very valiant effort at creating a tradition of Sinhalese art of music and song, yet he fell far short of a pioneering character. 
It was into this scene Amaradeva set his footsteps as Albert Perera. His voice was without match; his discipline of rendering a tune without breaking a single note and his attention to the minutest detail of lyrics and melody was coolly secured and deeply rooted in the construction of the totality of the song. Such discipline and attention to detail in the industry at the time was absent.
With the initiation of Albert Perera, another artist of superior value and quality stamped his own creed on the scene of art and culture. That was Professor Ediriweera Sarachchandra. Considered Sri Lankas premier playwright, he was a senior lecturer at the University of Peradeniya. His influence on Amaradeva, including changing the very persona from Albert Perera to Amaradeva, was fundamental and the subsequent rise of Amaradeva as the leading singing voice of Ceylon a logical evolution.Not only of the singer-musician Amaradeva but the expansion of Sri Lankan folk cum indigenous music and song was inevitable. 
From thereon, Amaradeva not only broadened the horizon of local music, he dominated the panorama of music and song. Addition of another unique artist Sri Lanka was fortunate to be blessed with, Mahagama Sekera, into the Amaradeva saga. That also engendered the blossoming of the thereto veiled talents and skills of contemporaneous lyricists/poets such as Sri Chandraratne Manawasinghe, Siri Gunasinghe, Madawala S. Ratnayake, Lucian Bulathsinghala and subsequently Sunil Ariyaratne.
Sunil Santha not only possessed a rich and melodious voice; his unpretentious melodies provided some of the most sung-along songs of any artist of our generation.
The contribution of Mahagama Sekera to Amaradevas development as a complete singer cannot be overstated. Madhuwanthi, a radio programme Amaradeva and Sekera took part in in the Radio Ceylon, as Sri Lankan Broadcasting Corporation was called then, produced some of the most magnificent lyrical and musical creations of all time. Sannaliyane (weavers song), Ase Mathuwena Kandulu Bindu Gena (tribute to Avukana Buddha Statue), Kanda Udin Ena Gomariye, Patu Adahas Nam Pawurin Lokaya (a song from Tagores Gitanjali ), Paalu Anduru Nil Ahasa Mamai, Mala Hiru Basina Henda Yaame are a collection of unsurpassed creations in the field of Sinhala music and song. 
Of the trio of Amaradeva, Sekera and Sarachchandra, Sekera is the ultimate artist, in that, Sekeras accomplishments in the fields of lyric writing, poetry, painting, as a playwright, film director are consummate and quintessential. The trio of Amaradeva, Sekera and Chithrasena produced the best five to seven minutes of Sinhala art and drama in the dramatization of tha Kandukara Himavu Arane song, which most critics consider as Amaradevas best song, with both Chithrasena and Vajira dancing to the sublime tune and steps so splendidly trained and superlatively performed. That is an occasion on which all three artists conjured and fashioned a jewel of a creation on stage. Yet again, in Chithrasenas Karadiya play, Amaradevas voice haunted in Hoiya Hooiya, a soulful rendition of the tough and sorrowful life of fishermen. 
The list is endless. Madawala Ratnayakes Ruwanmalee, a melancholy weeping for the village damsel who fell victim to the waters of the nearby river; even a weeping tribute to a maiden, Nil Maanel Mal Pipuna, unquestionably one of the most heart wrenching odes, one intertwined with a religious shade. One of Amaradevas last songs, Giman Harina Diyamba Dige, a soothing melody harmonized so enchantingly and taking the listener to another dimension of existence has not departed from the Amaradeva touch, yet finding a different terrain of entertainment. The magical way in which Amaradeva could detain an audience in a prison of spellbound silence and grip it in an enthralled trance was no accident. And no other artist had that talent, nor had the discipline to master such talent. 
Amaradeva had many imitators but none came close to the mastery of voice, the near-infinite expanse of the timber of that voice or the magnificent array of lyrical talents that surrounded him right throughout his career spanning more than six decades. In pure technique of singing no singer could match him, not Sunil Edirisinghe or Amarasiri Peiris, not Sanath Nandasiri or Victor Rantayake or Edward Jayakody. 
Only two artistes I would dare to compare with the Master. One is Sunil Santha; the other is H. R. Jothipala. Sunil Santha not only possessed a rich and melodious voice; his unpretentious melodies provided some of the most sung-along songs of any artist of our generation; it has continued to enchant thousands of avid listeners for many more decades. Jothipala is a different kettle of fish altogether. Most of Jothipalas songs were copies from Hindi songs; his lyricists did not bother to delve into the nuanced sentiments of life; his music directors made a bad attempt at imitating the music from Hindi musicians, sometimes with a little bit of success and others with gross failure. Yet Jothipalas voice was unique and his control of the note and timber of voice bordered on perfection.
Unfortunately Jothi who represented popular culture and arguably was,in technique, our best singer, never sang a good song! Such an oxymoron fitted Jothipalas genre. Both Amaradeva and Sunil Santha had imitators who could sing just like them; but Jothipala had no imitators. No singer could imitate Jothipalas voice. In the pure technique of singing, he could match Amaradeva. No argument. 
Yet Amaradeva stands alone atop a mount of highly talented singers. What made Amaradeva apart was not only his singing skills; the lyrics and music that accompanied the deep and reverberating voice which was once haunting and another time possessed a sweet melancholy, belonged to a rustic artist who was very much at peace with himself and his creations. When one hears Pil Padura Hnata Aragena Enawa, the forlorn environ the song creates in the heart and mind of the listener is breathtaking. Amaradevas songs were a painting with numerous abstract meanings while at the same time would take the fortunate to the land of artistic euphoria. 
In my book of Greats Modern Artists of Sri Lanka, I would include the following: Mahagama Sekera, Ediriweera Sarachchandra, Lester James Peiris, Joe Abeywickrema and last but not least, Amaradeva. In their own respective fields, they did not have equals. 
On November 3, 2016 - one year ago - Amaradeva closed his eyes for the last time. The songs that cascaded from his lips forgot to take leave with him. A true national treasure, Amaradeva will live with us as long as Sinhala music and song see their last. American Nobel laureate William Faulkner wrote thus: The aim of every artist is to arrest motion, which is life, by artificial means and hold it fixed so that a hundred years later, when a stranger looks at it, it moves again since it is life. Amaradeva was such an artist. Future generations would look at life and feel that arrested life and shall pass the purest of pure joy on to the next.

Angling instead of netting
	
Three members from yahapalanaya crossed over to the JO during the past few months.
However, Tikiri, the rebel from Wayamba, who was the first to make a big noise about their decision to quit the government, stays put as quietly as a mouse.
Meanwhile, JO stalwarts claim that it was according to a set plan that the dissident duo from Puttalam and the latest one from Gampaha have already quit yahapalanaya. The remaining dissidents too would follow suit in singles or doubles once a month or so according to this plan. They maintain that the move on the part of the next one on the list is due in about three weeks. However, they are not willing to divulge the name. According to a rumour that has gone viral, the next one on the waiting quit list is a senior character hailing from the periphery. He is set to say adieu to yahapalanaya after making yet another bid to reunite the two factions, they say.

Australians show interest to coach Lankan national squad
	
Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) may have a new national coach from Australia.
There have been at least three former cricketers from Australia, who have shown interest to take over the Head Coach post in Sri Lanka, it is reliably learnt.
Few Australian players have shown interest to be the coach, but we have not finalized with anyone yet, the source, speaking exclusively, said.
Without elaborating more, the source gave at least three names, who have come forward to take up the new assignment.
I can confirm that Dean Jones, Jason Gillespie and Andrew McDonald have shown interest, the source added further.
Jones, the former top order Australian batsman has played more international matches (52 Tests, and 164 ODIs), than the other two.
The 42-year-old former right-handed fast bowler Gillespie has experience of 169 international matches (Tests-71, ODIs- 97 and T-20-1), whereas McDonald, the Victoria coach has played only four Tests.
It could not be confirmed how many of these candidates have been interviewed but at least one among these confirmed to this paper having already been interviewed. He showed thumbs up sign when we wished him for the role.
It may also be noted here that the current interim coach Nick Pothas, although not proved successful with the results, is very popular among the players. (Bipin Dani)

ComBank makes leasing more affordable with Hybrid Leases
	
A new leasing product that makes leasing a higher value vehicle more affordable at commencement has been launched by Commercial Bank of Ceylon especially for upwardly mobile company executives and professionals.
The banks new Hybrid Lease combines the features of a Super Lease with the option of paying only a comparatively low rental during the first six or 12 months, paying regular rentals thereafter and a lump sum at the end of the lease.
The repayment structure of the Hybrid Lease is designed for executives and professionals earning a minimum salary of Rs.50,000 with anticipated, periodic increments. The customer begins by paying a very low rental during a specified period and a higher instalment when his or her earnings increase.
After the first six or 12 months, a fixed monthly rental can be paid until the penultimate month of the lease. Concluding the lease, a lump sum residual will be recovered as the final months payment.
This product will be offered for both unregistered and registered vehicles and for sale and lease-back leases, the bank said.
Commenting on the launch of this new product, Commercial Bank Deputy General Manager Personal Banking Sandra Walgama said, The Hybrid Lease provides an opportunity for vehicle enthusiasts to buy the automobile they aspire to own. They will now be able to purchase a higher value vehicle at an initial lower monthly rental, thanks to the novel repayment structure.
Hybrid Leases are expected to be most suitable for personal use vehicles from reputable brands that have a high resale value. Commercial vehicles too will be considered on a case-by-case basis, the bank said.
As an additional service to customers with excellent repayment records, the bank said it will offer an extension of up to two years on the lease tenure to repay the residual lump sum of the Hybrid Lease granted to unregistered vehicles. This extension is subject to conditions and if offered, will be treated as a fresh lease facility.

Country heading towards anarchy: JO
	
The Joint Opposition today said the country was heading towards anarchy because of the inefficient management skills of the Government.
Addressing the weekly news briefing of the JO, Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) Chairman G.L. Peiris said a Petti Kade (Kiosk) had a better management than the Government.
Sri Lanka has become a country with no Government today. No one is taking responsibility for issues and everyone keeps passing the ball, he said.
Health Minister blames doctors, Higher Education Minister blames students, Petroleum Minister blames the IOC and the IOC blames CPC in return. Meanwhile, the Government blames Fonterra for increased milk powder prices. This is how the Government functions, he said.
Meanwhile, he said the Governments famous slogan that it inherited a colossal amount of debt from the Rajapaksa Government had been proven wrong as public debt had increased by Rs. 2.8 trillion within the last two and a half years.
The public debt was Rs. 7.4 trillion as of December 31, 2014 and it had been increased to Rs. 10.2 trillion by June 30 this year. This is due to large-scale corruption taking place in the country including the Central Bank bond controversy, he said.
He questioned as to why the UNP or its leadership had not launched an investigation against MP Ravi Karunanayake over the charges revealed at the Bond Commission inquiry when the party had assured action against Western Provincial Councillor Randeer Rodrigo.
He said that they would contest the forthcoming election under a broad political alliance. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

Emergency Radiology - Helping to save lives
	
Sri Lanka College of Radiologists celebrates Intl Day of Radiology
Today, November 8, is earmarked as the International Day of Radiology which is celebrated each year by the global radiology community. It was on this day 121 years ago that German physicist Wilhelm Roentgen made history by inventing the X-ray, a discovery that revolutionised the practice of medicine. From that day on, radiology has emerged as one of the most important branches of medicine, continuing to develop in leaps and bounds, helping to save precious lives. Now in Sri Lanka too, Radiologists render a valuable service as specialised medical professionals in patient management, disease prevention, health screening and so forth.
Today, the Sri Lanka College of Radiologists, which is the professional body representing all Radiologists in the country, joins the world radiology community in celebrating the International Day of Radiology (IDoR 2017). This years theme is Emergency Radiology, highlighting the advances made in emergency radiology and its role in detection, diagnosis and management of acute diseases, injuries and trauma.
Emergency radiology can be defined as a branch of radiology, dedicated to imaging and management of patients who are acutely ill or injured. Although relatively-new as a field, emergency radiology has already emerged as a vital and indispensable specialty with a rapid growth parallel to the expansion of emergency medicine which itself is considered a separate specialty of medicine. Healthcare institutions worldwide have now established accident, emergency and primary care units, exclusively treating accidental trauma and medical and surgical emergencies.
Sports and occupational injuries are another category of emergencies necessitating designated facilities to provide emergency lifesaving care. These emergency units are equipped with modern imaging facilities such as high-end ultra-sound (US) and computed tomography (CT) scanners, and in some instances, with vascular intervention suites for prompt diagnosis and treatment of all kinds of emergencies. Therefore, responsibility of the emergency radiologist is immense and does not lie only with imaging of patients in the emergency department, but also as a clinician performing minimally-invasive procedures saving lives. Because emergencies can happen anytime, emergency radiologists should be always on hand, readily able to perform head-to-toe imaging procedures and interpret their results rapidly and accurately.
Because emergencies can happen anytime, emergency radiologists should be always on hand
There have been many technical advancements, scientific innovations and clinical developments in the field of emergency radiology during the past couple of decades. State-of-the-art high-end US, multi-detector CT and digital plain radiography has revolutionised patient care in emergency medicine. The attending radiologist diagnoses injuries and emergencies such as appendicitis, bowel obstruction, internal bleeding, stroke and gynecological emergencies, with the facilities available at his/her centre. Tertiary care hospitals in main cities are well-equipped with modern facilities even for interventional procedures where radiologists can treat internal bleeding, drain internal abscesses, relieve obstructions and so forth, without patients having to undergo cumbersome surgeries.
Prompt attendance to patients with stroke with vascular interventional procedures such as clot retraction could immensely improve long-term prognosis. However, this is in stark contrast to the challenging situation prevalent in peripheral parts of the island, where the radiologist is compelled to provide a comparable service with bare minimum of facilities available.
We, as the Sri Lanka College of Radiologists, mark the International Day of Radiology and align with its theme by highlighting the contribution of emergency radiology in the care of critically ill or injured patients. We will always strive to provide the best imaging facilities to our needy patients with the same commitment.

Fuel tanker Neveska Lady arrives
	
Bringing a ray of hope to those inconvenienced by the ongoing fuel shortage, the fuel tanker Neveska Lady entered Sri Lankan territorial waters carrying a stock of 40, 000 metric tonnes of petrol a short while ago, Petroleum Resources Development Deputy Minister Anoma Gamage told Daily Mirror.
She said that soon after the quality checking process is over the stock of fuel would be unloaded and distributed to filling stations.
Further, she said that although panic had been created among the people due to false propaganda, ministry officials and those from the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) had managed to successfully deliver the emergency stocks available with the government to minimize the inconvenience caused to the public.
According to her the shipment that had arrived contained 32, 750 metric tonnes of 92 Octane petrol and 7,500 metric tonnes of 95 Octane petrol.
According to sources at the CPC the quality checking process needed around 10 hours to complete while unloading the fuel stock would take a minimum of 18 hours to complete.
Meanwhile, it was reported that the stock that had been received was only sufficient for 15 days. However, another fuel tanker would be arriving from Singapore in the next couple of days. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

His rugged honesty and candour surprised them
	
The party leaders of the Betel leaf alliance met at the official residence of its secretarial one recently on the invitation of the alliance leadership to work out the fundamentals of their collective participation in the upcoming elections.
Several leaders of some minor political parties who had expressed their willingness to team up with the alliance too were present at this meeting. The attention of the participants soon turned to the question of allotting specific quotas of candidates to be fielded on the alliance list in different districts and the representatives of each political party in the alliance came up with the number of candidates they wished to field on the common list. The participants were in for a surprise when one party leader announced that he had no candidates to be included in the common list. The Betel leaf leaders asked this party leader why he did not want to field any candidates from his party. And the reply he gave turned their surprise to amazement. I, my wife and a few followers make up our party. Therefore, I dont want to field candidates. So I am not asking for a quota for my party. I know the art of addressing the people at election propaganda meetings. I am only asking for two things. Come election time give me a helicopter for my transport and provide me with an STF detail for my security. Thats enough for me!
The Betel leaf secretarial one replied: A leader of your standing and stature surely deserves such transport and security. I will arrange all that to your satisfaction with due approval from our boss.

The hooking game so far confined to the main political parties has made its way to some minor political parties as well, they say.
Going by the reports, it is the Tree party with a voter base in the East and led by a beleaguered leader from the Central Province which is going to be most affected by the ongoing action by some players of this game.
The Tree party leader reportedly got a jolt the other day when he learnt that one of his close followers had agreed to pole-vault to the rival party led by the political wizard of Wilpattu fame at a tryst arranged at the residence of a leading businessman.
What has raised more eye brows is an extension to this story that a certain purohita in yahapalanaya is manipulating the main actors in this particular hooking game from behind the scenes.

If CPC had enough stocks, this situation wouldnt have occurred : LIOC Managing Director
	
Managing Director Lanka Indian Oil Company (LIOC) Shyam Bhora disproved Petroleum Resource Development Minister Arjuna Ranatungas claim that his company had pressurized the Minister and the officials to accept the contaminated fuel shipment. Speaking to the Daily Mirror, Bhora said that although the LIOC had sufficient stock to meet the demands for 25 to 30 days without the contaminated stock that arrived at Colombo on October 15, as a goodwill gesture, he had requested their global suppliers to supply fuel to Sri Lanka in order to assist the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation as their shipments were getting delayed. 
When we understood that the shipments CPC was expecting on November 2 were getting delayed, we requested our global suppliers to send fuel to avert the crisis. These stocks are expected to arrive in Colombo on November 10. We have assisted the CPC to procure emergency shipments whenever they faced crisis situations. Even when the CPC officers were on strike, the LIOC worked round the clock to supply the petroleum products, Bhora said 

We are not here to confront the Minister or any other official
	The shipload of petrol that reached Colombo on October 15 was contaminated
	Once the shipment is rejected, we do not have any role to play thereafter with the stock until we receive another stock
The Excerpts
Q Is it true that the shipment of petrol that reached Colombo on October 15 was contaminated
Yes, the stock of 35,000MT petrol supplied by the French Oil Company M/s TOTAL that arrived the Colombo Port was contaminated. The appearance did not meet with the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) specifications for gasoline 92 Octane. So the stock was rejected, and which is understandable. 
Q Did the LIOC at any point refuse to accept the specification report
As per the routine procedure the stock was tested by the CPC and Ceylon Petroleum Storage Terminals Limited (CPSTL) laboratory before being accepted by us. It was found that the shipment contained some visible particles while the fuel stock met the chemical properties specification. Not only the CPC and CPSTL but also the LIOC refused to accept the shipment as we always maintain high quality standards. We never refused to accept the specification report as we have high regard to the procedure that the CPC is carrying out. 
Q At a press briefing held on Monday, Petroleum Resource Development Minister Arjuna Ranatunga blamed the LIOC for the fuel crisis situation the country is now facing and claiming that your failure to supply the stock on time resulted in a fuel shortage...
What a misleading statement it was! By the time the shipment reached Colombo on October 15, we had enough of stocks for 25 to 30 days. Because of the upcoming festive season we got this shipment down. How can a responsible Minister claim that it was because of us the country faces a fuel shortage If the CPC had enough of stocks, this situation would have never occurred. It is the CPC that caters to 84% fuel for the local market as they have over 1500 fuel stations comparing to LIOCs 200 that caters to 16% of the total requirement. 
Q According to the Minister, the rejected ship is still anchored on the sea off Trincomalee with the view of obtaining the CPC approval at any cost. How do you react to it
When the laboratory report stated that the fuel was contaminated, we immediately informed M/s TOTAL to replace the shipload. Once the shipload is rejected, we do not have any role to play thereafter with the stock, until we receive another. It is solely at the suppliers discretion the vessel has been taken out of the Sri Lankan waters or otherwise. If the ship is still anchored at the Trincomalee port, it is up to the authorities concerned to see under whose direction it is still in the Sri Lankan waters. It is incorrect to blame us without any reason. 
Q Is it true that that the supplier, M/s TOTAL offered to remove the particles through filtration and supply the same stock to CPC once again
Yes. As a replacement cargo takes 20 to 25 days to reach Colombo, the supplier offered to remove the particles through filtration process, which is a common practice. We then informed the CPC about the request. To which, the officials disagreed. On October 31, when we had a meeting with the Minister, the Ministry Secretary and other officials, we brought to their notice how the supplier was willing to filter the stock and transfer the purified fuel to another vessel (ship to ship transfer) as this is an allowed practice, to which we had the Sri Lanka Customs approval as well.
But when the Minister and the officials did not want to go for another test after following the filtration process, we informed the supplier to take the stock back and to deliver another stock. We are not here to confront with the Minister or any other officials, but to carry out our duties. Allegations that are levelled against the LIOC for pressurizing the politicians or the CPC to accept the contaminated fuel shipment are totally misleading. 
As a replacement cargo takes 20 to 25 days to reach Colombo, the supplier offered to remove the particles through filtration process, which is a common practice. We then informed the CPC about the request
Q There is also an allegation that the LIOC is forcing the CPC to buy this contaminated stock.What are your comments on this
Not true at all. I was so surprised by the remarks made by the Minister against the LIOC at the media briefing and also in the headlines in all newspapers in Sri Lanka. This is misleading. 
Q Is it true that LIOC filling stations do not sell diesel although they have sufficient stocks with them
It is a total misrepresentation of facts that diesel is not being sold at LIOC filling stations. The LIOC has adequate stocks of diesel at Trincomalee and Colombo, and the normal daily sale volume of 775MT is being continuously distributed from all our 200 filling stations. Unless they (filling stations) have gone dry due to any delay in supply of fuel, we have not, and will not refrain from selling fuel in any of our filling stations. 
Q The Minister alleged that you had a plan to get down a shipload of petrol and diesel of which the stock is supposed to be of inferior quality...
Through our parent company we were able to find another supplier who was willing to supply petrol and diesel - both in the same vessel. These are larger vessels and for them to supply a small volume of petrol was not viable and they wanted to supply both - diesel and petrol - in the same vessel.
The reason why the Minister claims that they can accept petrol but not diesel, as it is of inferior quality, because the diesel that we use in India is slightly different to what is being used in Sri Lanka. In India, we use Euro 4 diesel while in Sri Lanka, it is Euro 3. As the CPC says that the Indian specification does not tally with Sri Lankan, how can they say that the Indian diesel is of inferior quality 
Q Have you, at any time, tried to influence the Minister or any other politicians to allow the contaminated stock of petrol to be supplied
I would be very much thankful to the Minister if he could reveal the names of those who have tried to influence him or any other politicians who have been approached to buy this stock. We have been in this business over the years but this is the first time such an allegation has been levelled against us, which is very detrimental to our reputation.

More MPs hold dual-citizenship certificates: JO
	
Claiming that there were more MPs who hold dual-citizenship certificates other than Geetha Kumarasinghe the joint opposition today said some embassies and countries were not willing to reveal these details.
Addressing a news briefing, MP Sisira Jayakody said some countries like Canada, Australia and Switzerland wont give details of MPs especially that of TNA MPs.
He said the government has an obligation to obtain the details of the MPs and Ministers who hold dual-citizenship certificates.
Even the Home Affairs Minister accepted that there could be such MPs. We urge the government to take legal action against them. The government can intervene and get information from foreign countries and embassies. However, it shows no interest in doing this, he said.
The MP said had former MP Kumarasinghe joined the government accepting various invitations, she could have remained an MP.
When asked about the letter sent by the immigration controller informing the election observer PAFFREL that Ms. Kumarasinghe was the only MP who is a dual-citizen, MP Jayakody said it was not the case.
He reiterated the details should be obtained from embassies and not from Parliament as done by the Immigration Department.(Lahiru Pothmulla)

## Title: Nationality of judges not important: Japanese Prosecutor

Nationality of judges not important: Japanese Prosecutor
	
Referring to the question of international judges in an accountability mechanism, a top Japanese Prosecutor said, in his view, what is most important is not the nationality of judges.
Motoo Noguchi, a Prosecutor at the Supreme Prosecutors Office of Japan, has said what is most important was whether an individual serving as judge can be supported from all communities equally and whether the people were willing to leave the fate of the cases to his/her wisdom and professionalism.
What is more important is to secure the fair, skillful and efficient investigations which are a prerequisite to make any subsequent trials meaningful. Without high quality investigations there are not much that even most able judges can do, he said.
Issuing a statement, he said he was visiting Sri Lanka on an official mission of the Government of Japan, but his message was his personal one as an expert reflecting tentative observations as of today and does not necessarily reflect the views and positions of the Government of Japan.
It is critical to recognize that the ongoing efforts for the reconciliation mechanisms are for the entire people of Sri Lanka and are intended to benefit all of them in an equal manner.
The statement continues 
There may be some misunderstanding that the mechanisms will benefit only a part of the people of Sri Lanka, such as Tamil people, but this should not be the case. In addition to the unprecedented nature of the efforts, maybe some foreign words unfamiliar to the Asian people, such as transitional justice and accountability, are a cause of the misunderstanding. In fact, these words do not exist in the Japanese language, neither, and we have yet to find directly equivalent and natural translation of these words in Japanese. Therefore, I will try to explain my understanding of the reconciliation without using these words.
Later in the 20th century, Sri Lanka entered a tragic phase of violence and war which finally ended in 2009. Since then, the Government and people of Sri Lanka have been focusing on rebuilding a united, peaceful, and prosperous country. During the decades of prolonged violence and war, many people suffered immensely, irrespective of ethnicity or religion. Indeed, the serious sufferings extended to the entire country. But the tragic phase ended and now you are rebuilding your country.
As an initial step, there are several things to be prioritized, together with constant efforts to achieve further economic development. First, the fate and whereabouts of those who are still missing must be found and known to their families without further delay. Second, those who seriously suffered must be adequately redressed so that they can regain their dignity and hope and start a new life. Third, those who were responsible for these serious sufferings must be punished according to law and subject to the availability of credible evidence. Fourth, all the communities across the country must reunite to rebuild a peaceful and prosperous country and to prevent the recurrence of past tragedies.
To achieve the objectives above, the reconciliation mechanisms are composed of four pillars, truth, justice, reparations, and non-recurrence. All of them are equally important to rebuild the country and to lay the foundation for sustainable economic development for a united and peaceful country. It is important not only for the present Sri Lankan people, but more so for the generation of your children. You must not make your children face again all the tragedies that you had to undergo.
This is my understanding of what the reconciliation means. This is such a simple thing, which I trust is the common belief of all the Sri Lankan people. You dont need to see it as overly complicated or something foreign to the culture of Sri Lanka.
Among the four pillars, the accountability mechanism or criminal prosecution is seen as the most politically sensitive issue. I see this largely coming from the misunderstanding that the judicial mechanism that is under discussion will benefit only a part of the entire population, more concretely only Tamil people. This is because many people, in particular those from the majority community, tend to see this mechanism as a forum for prosecuting the alleged war crimes committed by the military forces during the war, while leaving the crimes committed by the LTTE side unaddressed. As a result, they tend to see the accountability mechanism as a structurally one-sided and inherently unfair forum aimed at punishing their war heroes.
I dont think that is the case, because what this mechanism intends to do is to prosecute those who were responsible for serious sufferings of people, irrespective of their ethnicity or religion, and thereby to provide justice to victims, their families, and their communities. The main criteria in the case selection should be the gravity of crime and not who committed the crime. This is exactly what is meant by the rule of law and there is no space for politics here. In other words, the judicial mechanism should be designed, structured and operated in a way that it will benefit all the communities of Sri Lanka in a fair and equal manner. The scope of crimes to be addressed by the judicial mechanism needs to be carefully considered taking this point into account, both in terms of material and temporal jurisdiction. Because this is a critical point to ensure the unreserved support and active participation for the judicial mechanism, which are crucial for its success in delivering justice that is acceptable to all.
It is also important to know that the judicial mechanism is not a forum to pursue collective responsibility to some entities including the military forces. On the contrary, it is procedures to identify individual criminal responsibility, thereby contributing to convictions against some individuals while releasing others from unfounded allegations against them. And those who are prosecuted of course have a right to rebut to charges against them under due process of law and shall be acquitted in case of a successful defense or the absence of evidence to prove guilt beyond reasonable doubt.
The question of international judges seems to have been focused in the discussion surrounding the accountability mechanism. In my view, what is most important is not the nationality of judges, but whether an individual serving as judge can be supported from all the communities equally and whether the people is willing to leave the fate of cases of his/her wisdom and professionalism. What is more important is to secure the fair, skillful and efficient investigations which are a prerequisite to make any subsequent trials meaningful. Without high quality investigations there are not much that even the most able judges can do.
Some may argue that it would be better to forget about past events and just look to the future, without undergoing painful and complicated procedures of criminal prosecution and trials. However, I think such an approach will effectively endorse the culture of impunity, will fail to provide justice to victims, and will increase the risk of recurrence of similar crimes and tragedies. As an established democratic country, Sri Lanka must stick to the rule of law, not only on legal texts but also through concrete action of the judiciary.
In the end, the ability of State to protect its people by adherence to the rule of law is one of the most essential infrastructure of a Nation State. Same as other critical elements of social infrastructure such as water, sanitation, education, transportation and financial systems, the principled and efficient judiciary is a key element for a democratic nation. For Sri Lanka to make great steps forward towards sustainable economic development and prosperity, the stable and determined application of the rule of law is a must. Japan is a long friend of Sri Lanka. Nearly seventy years ago, when Japan was struggling to rebuild the country from the scourge of war, Sri Lanka was one of the first countries which strongly supported Japan in its endeavors to return to the international community.
Now that Sri Lanka is determined to overcome the past tragedies and move forward, I, as a Japanese citizen, am most honoured and pleased to be of any help to you in these unprecedented endeavors. I thank you, my friends, he said.

The Green leader gave a severe warning to a onetime high flier from a city-based stronghold the other day, they say.
This worthy now shorn of his wings had incurred the wrath of the party boss for having made it a practice to wine and dine a select group of backbenchers at high-end hotels from time to time.
The party boss reprimanded the man on a previous occasion too for taking the advantage of his brief absence from the island to conduct a workshop for the young Diyawanna backbenchers.

## Title: Petrol shortage across country  Who fuelled the fuel crisis

Petrol shortage across country  Who fuelled the fuel crisis
	
The impending fuel crisis has caused much inconvenience to the public. Long queues of three wheelers, cars and other vehicles and complaints by the public indicate the severity of this crisis. The rejection of a shipment imported by the Lanka Indian Oil Company (LIOC) was one of the main reasons behind this shortage. The LIOC accounts for 16% of market share in the supply of petrol in the country and officials claim that to date they have not supplied any substandard fuel to the consumers. 
Several rejections in fuel shipments, a major delay in the arrival of a ship under the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) and a sudden breakdown of the Sapugaskanda oil refinery, added more fuel to the fire. Hence, the Daily Mirror sheds light on the main reasons why this shortage took place and what measures could be taken to mitigate such situations in future.
We predicted this disaster, warned the govt.- Trade union
	Ministry requests to issue petrol only for vehicles 
	Sapugaskanda oil refinery could break down any time
	The ship is expected to arrive tonight
What went wrong
On October 15, 2017, a ship containing petrol brought down by the LIOC was rejected by two experiments. Upon rejection, the ship was returned but according to sources, it has been docked in Trincomalee for over 16 days in an attempt to distribute this fuel back to the consumers. According to regulations, if one stock is rejected the Company has to get down an alternative stock which was supposed to reach Sri Lanka on October 31, 2017. But several days later the Company has refused to bring it down.
On the other hand, a ship distributing fuel stocks to the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) was supposed to reach Sri Lanka on November 2, 2017 but that too would reach Lankan waters only on November 9. According to Minister of Petroleum Resources Development, Arjuna Ranatunga, this is the first time that a fuel shipment has delayed to reach its destination. The mess was further worsened when the Sapugaskanda oil refinery too broke down on October 31 following a power failure and this continued for three days. With this failure, a production of 330 metric tonnes (MT) generated per day was halted. 
2500 MT of petrol will be distributed for the next few days : Arjuna Ranatunga
I apologise to the public for the inconvenience caused, said subject Minister Arjuna Ranatunga speaking to media on Monday. But if I approved the distribution of this substandard oil and if it was mixed with other fuel in the stations, there would have been a bigger problem.
This would not have been such an issue but this panic situation was created through a series of text messages which were sent out by an organized group. Today the issue has blown out of proportion to the extent that people have started collecting petrol in bottles and cans and have started their own businessess. The next ship is supposed to reach Lankan waters on the night of November 8, and by November 9, this petrol issue will be controlled. There is no issue with diesel and stocks are sufficient for the next two or three weeks.
The storage capacity for petrol is only 90,000 MT in the storage facilities we have
I have been asked if I would investigate into the matter but right now what I want is to get down petrol and nothing else. We will also be implementing a mechanism to stop bringing in substandard fuel. For the next few days, 2500 MTs of fuel will be distributed but due to a higher demand, several stations have a tendency of running out of petrol. 
The storage capacity for petrol is only 90,000 MT in the storage facilities we have. A ship usually has a capacity of 40,000 MT. As such, a ship arrives when this amount is needed. Otherwise it would be quite costly to import shipments as and when required. Due to this situation, there is a 1.5% increase in the demand for petrol in stations, islandwide, he added. 




The responsible company(s) should be blacklisted :Wasantha Samarasinghe
Airing his views about this issue, JVP politburo member and Voice Against Corruption Convener Wasantha Samarasinghe said that if a company (supplier) delays to send their shipments or sends substandard fuel then they have to be blacklisted. They are putting an entire country at an inconvenience. Therefore this issue cannot be taken on a lighter note. Because of this crisis, the government moves to obtaining Spot Tenders instead of Term Tenders and because of this, the loss incurred in more than Rs. 5,836 million.
The other issue is that these Spot Tenders are also given by the same people who give Term Tenders and in this situation they give their shipments at a higher price. As a result, everyone has to buy fuel at a higher cost today. The government has to be responsible for this entire fiasco and people have now observed the so-called good governance they all spoke about.

Lack of adequate storage facilities needs to be addressed : CPCWU
In his opinion, General Secretary of the Ceylon Petroleum Common Workers Union (CPCWU) D. J. Rajakaruna said that the main reasons for this fuel shortage are the delay in this particular shipment and the lack of adequate storage facilities. If the country cannot store fuel then it is an issue that the government has to address immediately.
The issue with CPC fuel is that its stores are less but the consumption is high. There are 99 tanks in Trincomalee but only eight are being used by IOC. A cabinet approval was then given to give 10 tanks to CPC but this was not allowed. But instead the government decides to lease these tanks to IOC. But if these tanks had been given to CPC we could have saved the money and converted it into an international storage facility on the long run.
This is the main reason why we filed a case as well. We saw this issue coming and we warned the government as well, but they didnt take any notice. The Sapugaskanda Oil Refinery needs refurbishing and it would shut down any time. So without looking at these issues, the government is keener in leasing the Trincomalee Oil Tanks to India. I think we do not need IOC in Sri Lanka at all, because more than the concerns of the people they are aiming at the oil tanks in Trinco. 
The trade union stated that if substandard oil is sent, theres a tendency for the company [supplier] to get blacklisted but it depends on the agreement between the supplier and the buyer. In addition to that if a shipment is delayed, legal actions could be taken upon inquiry.
The trade union also confirmed that at this point, before the government takes action on its delay the ship has to immediately distribute its fuel upon arrival accordingly as people are already facing a crisis. Usually if a ship delays, it will be a disadvantage for the ship (supplier) as they will have to dock their ships for a long time and it would cost them a lot of money.
The supplier may be blacklisted Shyam Bohra, MD - LIOC
Speaking to the , Managing Director of LIOC Shyam Bohra said that legal actions would be taken against the supplier and it could even go to the extent of blacklisting. It was the fault of the supplier; M/s TOTAL, a French Multinational Company who had sent some fuel with visible particles. Immediately after the rejection, we sent this ship back and we are yet to receive a new stock on November 10. As far as the specifications are concerned the product has failed to meet the quality compliance process. When the samples were tested at the CPC/CPSTL laboratory the fuel contained some visible particles and therefore the stock was rejected.
As far as the specifications are concerned the product has failed to meet the quality compliance process
On this note, we requested the supplier to replace the cargo. We have been buying fuel from this supplier for the past four to five years and this is the first instance we had a problem. LIOC has not distributed low quality fuel and this could be confirmed through past records.
He further said that 3500 MT of petrol was still available and some quantity of petrol is also generated from the LIOC Trincomalee Terminal. The present situation is mainly due to the fact that the stock of petrol imported by CPC has got delayed and M/s TOTAL is taking time to replace the cargo.

Trincomalee Oil Tank Farm
The Trincomalee Oil Tank Farm entail a great deal of engagement in Indo-Lanka relations. The then United National Party (UNP) led government signed a tripartite agreement in February 2003 to develop the oil tank farm with India.
The parties of this agreement included the government of Sri Lanka [GoSL], Lanka IOC [Pvt] Ltd. [LIOC] and Ceylon Petroleum Corporation [CPC]. As per the lease agreement, the oil tank farm with 99 tanks was to be handed over to the LIOC for use for a period of 35 years.
Accordingly, they started using 14 tanks in the lower farm area. The remaining 84 tanks in the upper tank area were not in use. Back in March 2015, during the Indian PMs visit to Sri Lanka it was agreed that Lanka IOC [LIOC] and the CPC would jointly develop the Upper Tank Farm of the China Bay Installation in Trincomalee on mutually agreed terms.

PINA brings purified drinking water to CKDu-affected areas
	
Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is a fast-growing killer in the Northern part of Sri Lanka and one way to battle it is through the provision of clean drinking water. Identifying this as a grave problem, the PINA organisation has taken up the challenge to provide purified drinking water to various Chronic Kidney Disease of unknown aetiology (CKDu) affected areas, kicking off its project from the beginning of this year. PINA was established as a Non-Governmental Organisation in 1988 under the name PINA HILFE fur Sri Lanka e.v. with the assistance of a few colleagues from Germany. In 2011, this was incorporated and approved as a charitable organisation by the Sri Lankan Government under the Parliament Act No. 25.
Speaking to PINA President Dr. Anura Abeygoonewardana and Vice President Ananda Jayasekera, Daily Mirror learnt that the organisation is now focusing on people who are suffering from CKDu and CKDu-affected areas in the Northern and North Central regions of the country. The project is a Reverse Osmosis (RO) Plant.
In line with President Sirisenas concept and supporting the mission of donating RO Plants to produce pure drinking water, the first plant was established in Padaviya Mahasen Maha Vidyalaya in Anuradhapura on January 2 this year. The plant produces 10, 000 litres of pure drinking water per day and has benefited as much as 1,200 children and 700 families in the area.
The second plant, which will be inaugurated tomorrow by President Sirisena, is located at Minneriya Nagalakanda Navodya Maha Vidyalaya. It will provide thousands of students with pure drinking water in a bid to make their lives healthier. Several officials from the government and PINA, and representatives in Europe and the Sri Lanka Navy are expected to attend this milestone.
Mr. Ananda Jayasekera (left) and Dr.Anura Abeygoonewardana (right) Pic by Waruna Wanniarachchi
Dr. Abeygoonewardana and Mr. Jayasekera explained, The RO Plants, funded by PINA, are built and installed by the Sri Lanka Navy. Several donors and well-wishers from Germany have also made financial contributions to this project. The Sri Lanka Navy is doing a commendable job by supporting such plants. They will also provide necessary services or repairs, and a Navy officer will take care of the management of the plant.
Furthermore, Dr. Abeygoonewardana expressed his views on future projects. In 1991, PINA initiated in building a primary classroom for Sigiriya Maha Vidyalaya and 27 years later, it hopes to refurbish the structure. In addition to this, as the third RO Project, a special plant will be erected at the same venue in Sigiriya which will provide purified drinking water to 1,200 students, 4,000 families and most of the tourists who visit Sigiriya on a daily basis.
A RO plant takes natural, polluted water from the ground and purifies it through a special filtering process. It is far better than normally purified water from the water board as it extracts unwanted particles thus giving the actual water capacity.
Dr. Abeygoonewardana and Mr. Jayasekera said, We chose to focus on a project based on CKDu-affected areas because it is the need of the hour. We need to focus on the concept of getting people out of CKD. It is a recognised threat which the government has formed a task force against. We also wish to make the younger generation a healthier one and will act to reduce the death toll caused by this malady. PINA has focused on a variety of humanitarian and development projects in the past. It can count up to donating approximately 320,000 spectacle frames and medical equipment worth over a staggering Rs. 82 million. PINA has carried out a number of construction and renovation projects and has distributed 2,150 wheelchairs, 500 walking chairs, 1,700 pairs of clutches, 2,200 tents and a variety of quick aid following the Tsunami disaster. Also, the organisation has won a Transparency Award in Germany.

Power devolution not to favour Tamil people: Amaraweera
	
Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said today power devolution would be done not to favour the Tamil people and that it was done following a request by all the Chief Ministers to give them an opportunity to carry out powers vested on them by the 13th Amendment.
He told parliament that Chief Ministers and Provincial Councillors had requested that they should be given more powers as huge amount of money was spent on provincial councils.
"We are devolving power not to the LTTE. There is a rumour that Tamil people would be given something special. It is not true. Chief Ministers and Provincial Councillors said that lots of money is spent on provincial councils and requested us to give them powers vested on them from the 13th Amendment, he said.
Speaking during the debate on the interim report of the steering committee, he said the unity government was formed to implement a national programme in the country.
"The unity government was formed to implement a national policy which was not changed with the change of governments," he said
He said the responsibility of the government was to work with all the communities so that the country would not lead to another war.
He said certain groups were creating false fear among the people about the new Constitution and added that no draft or Constitution had been submitted in the constitutional assembly as alleged by some people.
"When the national anthem was sung in the Tamil language, they alleged that the country would be divided and a separate flag would also be introduced. But that did not happen," he said.
He said they would not support any Constitution which would result in the division of the country, endanger unitary state character, change the place given to Buddhism and introduce federal state. (Ajith Siriwardana and Yohan Perera)

A Presidency similar to the one in India should be introduced repealing the existing Executive Presidency, which vests extreme powers with the President, Joint Opposition MP Kumara Welgama said in Parliament today.
Speaking during the debate on the Interim Report of the Steering Committee, he said from the very begining he held the opinion that the Executive Presidency should be changed.
"I spoke of changing the Executive Presidency at the SLFP Central Committee meeting several months ago after which I was not allowed to attend it," he said.
Mr. Welgama said they were not opposed to devolving power to the people living in the North.
"We have no issue of devolving power. We are not opposed to giving Tamils living in the North whatever they should be given. But not to the political parties," he said.
He said this Constitution was not needed for Sri Lankans but it was needed for the International Community.
He said he did not see the need for devolving power when Pradeshiya Sabhas, Urban Councils and Provincial Councils were functioning in the country.
He added that the power devolution would cause more issues.
"People in the North do not need power devolution or Federal State. What they need is to obtain their lands and means to develop their economy," he said. (Ajith Siriwardana and Yohan Perera)

SLMA urges medical students to return
	
The Sri Lanka Medical Association (SLMA) said yesterday it was deeply concerned about the prevalent turmoil in medical education in the country and urged medical students of all State medical faculties to immediately return to their academic activities.
SLMA President Professor Chandrika Wijayaratne said in a statement that the SLMA called upon the parents of medical students of all State medical faculties to encourage and ensure that their children returned to their academic activities without further delay and requested the academic staff of all State medical faculties and their respective medical teachers trade unions to create, ensure and sustain an environment in which students can commence and continue with their interrupted academic activities without further delay.
The SLMA requested the University Grants Commission (UGC) of Sri Lanka to ensure that all categories of staff attached to all medical faculties perform their duties as per UGC and other relevant government rules, regulations and circulars without any further delay and called upon all medical doctors in Sri Lanka to adhere to and maintain the highest standards of professionalism in providing healthcare services to the citizens of Sri Lanka without interruption.
It requested the Sri Lankan Government to ensure that all agreements it reaches with all relevant stakeholders, be carried out without any compromise.
The SLMA wishes to further reiterate its position with regards to the health services and medical education in the country. We are particularly concerned that under the existing rules and regulations in the Medical Ordinance and the Universities Act, the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) has only limited powers to regulate and ensure standards of medical education in Sri Lanka. Therefore, there is an urgent need to enact legislation to make the SLMC an independent authority with adequate powers to protect the public from unqualified or substandard medical practitioners, the statement said.
The SLMA also said it wished to state that their organization, as the apex medical body that represents all grades of doctors in the country, is not against properly constituted and regulated Private Medical Education in the country.
However, the issue of Private Medical Education in the country needs further discussion, the statement stated.

A few people are doing wrong analysis about my appointment of a Presidential Commission of Inquiry to look into the Central Bank Bond issue. A very few people in the government are accusing me through websites and Facebook campaigns.
I am attacked by spending money on certain media institutions and by reserving pages in weekend newspapers. I can face attacks coming from both the opposition and government. But those in the government are attacking me because I am working towards the just society that Sobitha Thera expected. He would have paid a tribute to me if he was alive, he said.

The main purpose of his quiet visit was to find out all the whys and wherefores relating to the massive protest staged against that country in the area recently.
During this visit the envoy reportedly spoke to many people from all walks of life to learn at first hand their views and sentiments about his countrys involvement in several key projects in the district. He had taken advantage of these meetings with the ordinary people to gauge their opinion about the political situation in the country as well.
Once back in Colombo, during a conversation with a group of friends the envoy had reportedly made a significant prediction about a possible political scenario in the country. Some yahapalanaya stalwarts who heard about this prediction did not find it to their liking, they say.

The one left behind laments
	
Number One in yahapalanaya recently paid an official visit to Qatar, the country in the Mid-East much in the news these days.
His entourage included a number of Muslim purohitas as well as Muslim leaders and among the latter was much articulate national unity advocate Sally who is not even a member of the Diyawanna council.
However, the bearded politico from Colombo Central despite being a Blue party senior was conspicuous by his absence in this entourage.
Much cut up over his non-inclusion in this delegation to the Mid-East nation, the elderly politico had lamented that he would not have suffered this kind of contemptuous disregard if the visit was made in the good old days of the former strongman.

They are to take up cudgels for allowing alien presence
	
Diyawanna members from both sides of the great divide evinced an unusual get-up and go in the recent debate on the Constitutional Steering Committee proposals.
The presence of a group of important visitors from the West in the public gallery during the assembly proceedings was the main reason for the debate to turn so lively, they say.
By the way, a rumour doing rounds said this important group of visitors from the West arrived here for the specific purpose of knowing at first hand the views and sentiments of the Diyawanna members about the proposed Constitutional reforms and that on the invitation ofsome membersfrom the North.
Meanwhile, the JO big guns ever on the look-out for some new weapon to attack the yahapalanaya with, has decided to raise a question in the council about the presence of the foreigners when the debate on the Constitutional proposals was on.
