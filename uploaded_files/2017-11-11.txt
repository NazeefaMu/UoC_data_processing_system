Agricultural Ministry: Rs.4.9mn as electricity charges for vacant building: Nalinda
	
Exposing another instance of blatant waste and corruption, JVP MP Nalinda Jayatissa yesterday revealed that the still-to-be-occupied Agricultural Ministry building in Rajagiriya had incurred Rs.4.9 million as electricity tariffs for just thirteen months.
He said but in contrast the Agricultural Ministry had paid Rs.13.9 million as electricity charges for the building it currently occupied.
In the absence of the Agricultural Minister, the Chief Government Whip Gayantha Karunathilaka responded saying that Rs.4.9 million was spent on electricity because some repair work was being done to convert the building into an office space.
Mr. Jayatissa then said it was the duty of the owners of the building to complete all the modifications and the repairs to the building before handing it over to the government. (Ajith Siriwardana and Yohan Perera)

Budget promoting beer: JVP
	
JVP MP Sunil Hadunnetti said yesterday that beer consumption had been promoted with the Budget reducing taxes on beer and by removing the production tax on a can of beer.
Speaking at the budget debate, he said the government had increased the tax on the sugar content in soft drinks to discourage consumption of soft drinks while reducing the tax on beer which also contains a high sugar content.
"A beer factory uses about 300 bags of sugar daily for the production of beer," the MP said.
Finance Minister Mangala Samaraweera said more than 100 gm of sugar is contained in a 400 ml bottle of soft drinks and pointed out that there was no issue in consuming a can of beer.
"We imposed tax according to the volume of alcohol consumed to discourage the consumption of strong drinks containing high volumes of alcohol," he said.
Minister Sarath Amunugama further explaining the matter said, tax would not affect the consumption of sugar in general and added that it would only apply to the sugar content in soft drinks. (Ajith Siriwardana and Yohan Perera)

Delhi?s poor bear the brunt of deadly smog
	
New Delhi, (The Hindu), NOV 10, 2017 - With the air quality in Delhi hitting hazardous levels over the past few days, the National Green Tribunal (NGT) said it would meet on Friday to discuss the government?s odd-even car rationing scheme for five days, starting from November 13.Rickshaw driver Sanjay can only afford a handkerchief to shield his face from the smog-filled streets of Delhi, even as many residents rush to buy protective masks to combat the toxic menace.? ?
Better off inhabitants of the world?s most polluted capital are swarming sellers of face masks ?costing more than the <U+20B9> 300 that Sanjay earns in a day? and high-tech air purifiers that could easily cost his annual wage.? ?Delhi authorities on Wednesday ordered all 6,000 schools to shut until Sunday after choking smog descended on the north of the country, while people with breathing difficulties have been told to stay indoors.? ?
But doctors say that none of it will be enough to prevent deaths in the metropolis of 20 million people battling a pollution crisis for the second year.? ?
Some streets have recorded pollution levels 40 times the World Health Organization recommended safe level since Monday, with still weather and the annual post-harvest burning of crop stubble in Punjab fuelling the crisis.? ?
Rickshaw drivers, street vendors and tens of thousands of homeless families endure the full force of pollution that doctors warn can do irreparable damage to the heart, brain and lungs, especially in children.? ? ?

Dr. Padeniya's contempt case -- Ruling on Dec 6
	
The Court of Appeal Bench comprising Justices L.T.B. Dehideniya (President/CA) and A.L.S. Gooneratne yesterday fixed December 6 to deliver its ruling on GMOA President Anuruddha Padeniya who is facing charges of contempt of court .
The charge sheet was read to the respondent in court and notice issued directing him to show cause as to why he should not be punished for the offence. He pleaded not guilty.
Gamini Marapana PC with Navin Marapana appeared for Dr. Padeniya while Upul Jayasuriya with Chandimal Rajapakse and Lakna Seneviratne instructed by Chitrananda Liyanage appeared for the petitioners.
The National Movement for Social Justice (NMS) Convener Prof. Sarath Wijesuriya and the Puravesi Balaya Convener Gamini Viyangoda filed the petition complaining that Dr. Padeniya had committed the offence of contempt of court.
The petitioners state that the Court of Appeal delivered its judgment on January 31, 2017 and issued a writ of mandamus directing the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) to provisionally register SAITM's MBBS graduates as medical practitioners and issued a writ of prohibition preventing it from refusing to do so.
They stated that the GMOA had openly criticized the CA judgment and demanded that it be set aside and that the GMOA had called for trade union action against SAITM in the wake of the Court of Appeal judgement.
The petitioners state that the GMOA on April 7 had organized a protest march and a rally at which the respondent delivered a speech and made deliberate, malicious and contemptuous statements in relation to the court process, judgment and the conduct of the Judges and the Attorney General.
They state that at an interview, GMOA Secretary Nalinda Soysa said the President should exercise his executive powers to quash the Court of Appeal ruling and that the respondent had obstructed the due administration of justice coercing other authorities to apply pressure on the Court.
They are seeking Court to deal with the respondent and punish him for committing the offense of contempt of court.? (S.S. Selvanayagam)

Dual citizens among MPs -- If any, they must be jailed: Samarasinghe
	
If there are any parliamentarians who are dual citizens, they should not only be barred from Parliament, stripped of their parliamentary privileges and asked to pay compensation but should also be sent to jail, Ports and Shipping Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe said yesterday.
He told the weekly SLFP news briefing that the country's apex court has given a clear ruling on dual citizenship and as such no parliamentarian with dual citizenship has the right to sit in the House anymore.
?The law must be amended to send parliamentarians with dual citizenship to jail in addition to disqualifying them from sitting in Parliament and being stripped of their parliamentary privileges,? the minister said and added he had never obtained dual citizenship as suggested by some media institutions.
Meanwhile, the Peoples Action for Free and Fair Election (PAFFREL) in a letter to Speaker Karu Jayasuriya requested that an affidavit be obtained from every parliamentarian confirming that he or she was not a dual citizen.
PAFFREL Executive Director Rohana Hettiarachchi said in his letter that there was a suspicion among the people that several MPs were dual citizens.
?We checked with the Controller of Emigration and Immigration whether any of the MPs are dual citizens. The Controller informed us that there were no parliamentarians holding a dual citizenship other than the former MP Geetha Kumarasinghe who lost her seat after the recent Supreme Court ruling. But we are not satisfied with that information and we urge the Speaker to urge all 225 parliamentarians to certify that none of them are dual citizens so as to dispel the doubts of the people,? he said.

for anything.??
The best of us who pass on fade into memory as the years roll by. I write these few lines to trigger the minds of those who knew him to keep his memory alive.? ?
Fr. Derrick is for sure someone who is worthy of much remembrance.??

Kumar seeks avenues for Indo-Sri Lankan  film co-productions
	
Indian filmmaker P. Suneel Kumar Reddy was here last week, seeking avenues for Indo-Sri Lankan film co-productions.??
He has a broader vision of bringing together talent from SAARC countries in film?
making projects.??
On his initial visit to Sri Lanka, Suneel Kumar was accompanied by his producer, Y. Ravindra Babu.??
Both are from the state of Andra Pradesh (part of which is now called Telengana) and have been friends from their days as students of mechanical engineering. Only Ravindra Babu is now employed in a related field, Suneel Kumar having opted for journalism and film making after graduating as a mechanical engineer. Having worked as a Telugu-language newspaper editor, he calls himself a journalist with film as his ?medium.? In addition to film making, he now teaches film making and conducts workshops.
??
This duo have been in the film making business together for 17 years. They make films under the Sravya Film Company label. They have made films in Telugu, Tamil and Malayalam.??
?
?
Suneel Kumar has made 16 features so far, including children?s films. He was in Sri Lanka with a children?s film venture in mind, an adventure story with special effects and actors from both countries.??
Self-taught as a film maker, he makes both commercial films with those fight and dance sequences common to the subcontinent?s films as well those with more serious content. His 2010 film ?Gangaputhrulu? won 18 state awards including best director and best dialogue writer.??
In Indian film making, dialogue writing is taken very seriously and is a separate profession. Suneel Kumar writes his own scripts as well as dialogue.??
?As people, we have the same emotions no matter where we come from. I see film as a unifying matter,?said Suneel Kumar.? His latest film ?Gulf? is about the hopes of those who seek a way out of poverty through Mideast employment. It tells the story of a young weaver who can?t make enough in this traditional craft.??
As he puts it: ?there are many success stories and also some failures in this region. This film intends to discuss various case studies in an entertaining fashion.??
?
His 2012 film ?Oka Romantic Crime Kata? was about how the young take to crime. It was a box office success and he is now making the sequel, titled ?Romantic Criminals.???
He tackled a topical socio-economic issue in his film ?ATM Working,? which was about the Government?s demonitisation decision which wiped out the savings of millions of Indians.??

?The original title was ?ATM Not Working,? Kumar said. ?But the censor board objected and we had to change the title,? he reflected.?
Suneel Kumar is an articulate filmmaker keen on expanding his horizons beyond the borders of India.??

Parliament may be flooded if Ambatale dam is not renovated soon
	
The Parliament complex is likely to inundated if the Ambatale Dam is not renovated and in such a situation a flood hits the Colombo District again, Megapolis Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka said yesterday.
He said this when MP S.M. Marikkar pointed out that the government should focus on protecting the Ambatale Tank, which was in a dilapidated stage.

He said the renovating the Ambatale Dam was an urgent priority because it had been neglected since its construction during the colonial period. (Yohan Perera and Ajith Siriwardana)
