Video: Extend the term of local govt. bodies or go for a poll: Dullas
	
The Government should announce an election if it was not going to extend the term of local government bodies without transferring their powers to a special commissioner or a Secretary, UPFA MP Dullas Alahapperuma said.
Mr. Allahapperuma speaking at a media briefing this morning said transferring the powers of the local government bodies to such a Commissioner would be fulfilling the UNP?s agenda.
He said the UNP is aiming to deteriorate UPFA?s power in local government bodies before holding a general election.
Mr. Allahapperuma alleged that the UNP was attempting to go for a general election by taking over the power of local government bodies.
He requested the UPFA MPs who had obtained ministerial positions in the government not to allow such a move.
Mr. Allahapperuma said it was not surprising for the UNP to attempt to break the unity of the SLFP and said they were doubtful whether the SLFPers who joined the UNP government were also attempting to do so.(Ajith Siriwardana)WATCH ?

Video: UPFA MPs to go to Geneva over harassment
	
UPFA parliamentarian Bandula Gunawardane today said they would lodge a complaint with the Inter-parliamentary Union (IPU) in Geneva within next two weeks against the harassment faced by certain UPFA MPs due to the growing influence of the ?state police? concept.
MP Gunawardane said it was important to inform the international community about Ranil Wickremesinghe?s ?police government?.
He said they decided to complain to the IPU to ensure the security of the peoples? representatives.
?We will go to Geneva and complain to the IPU soon after we obtain an opportunity to meet them. The government officials and the bootlickers of this so called police government should know that we as peoples? representatives of the parliament have international protection,? he said.(Ajith Siriwardana)WATCH ?

## Title: Himalayan 'drop after Nepal quake'

Himalayan 'drop after Nepal quake'
	
The height of a swathe of the Himalayas has dropped by around one metre as a result of the devastating Nepal earthquake, scientists say.
But they add that the drop will roughly be balanced by slow uplift due to tectonic activity.
And they have yet to analyse satellite images of the region in which the most famous Himalayan peak - Everest - is located.
However, there continues to be debate over exactly how tall Everest is.
"The primary stretch that had its height dropped is a 80-100km stretch of the Langtang Himal (to the northwest of the capital, Kathmandu)," said Richard Briggs, a research geologist with the United States Geological Survey (USGS).
The Langtang range is the region where many locals and trekkers are still missing, presumed dead, after the avalanches and landslides that were triggered by the 7.8 magnitude earthquake on 25 April.
Scientists believe the height of a handful of other Himalayan peaks, including the Ganesh Himal to the west of the Langtang range, may also have dropped. The satellite images they have analysed so far have focused on central Nepal, which was the hardest hit by the quake. Everest is to the east of this main shaking zone.
Scientists say whether or not the world's highest peak saw a change in its height by few centimetres will have to be further confirmed by ground survey and GPS or an airborne mission.
"But what we see in the data that we evaluated further away from the plate boundary, to the north of the capital Kathmandu, is a clearly identifiable region with subsidence of up to 1.5m," says Christine Minet, a geologist with the German Aerospace Centre (DLR), which processed the Nepal earthquake data sent by the Sentinel-1a satellite.
Scientists with DLR's Earth Observation Centre of compared two separate images of the same region sent by the satellite, before and after the quake. "The positive value we have received (from the satellite image) after the quake means the area (the mountains in and around the Langtang region) is further away from the satellite and it is lower now," said Mr Minet.
"But with this result we cannot say that a specific mountain is one-point-something-metres lower; it is the general area that we can assess."
He said the satellite images showed the area of the mountain range had dropped by 0.7m-1.5m.
The study has also found that areas including the capital, Kathmandu, to the south of the Himalayan mountains have been uplifted by the quake.
"The negative value we have received from the acquisitions of the before and after earthquake images means that some areas (Kathmandu and its surroundings) are now closer to the satellite, and that means they have seen an uplift," says Mr Minet.
Scientists say the drop and the uplift are normal geological behaviour during an earthquake of this scale.
"The fault underneath Kathmandu has slipped and it's moved the overriding part of the crust to the south towards the southern end of the part that squashes the crust; and to the northern end it stretches it," says Tim Wright, professor of satellite geodesy at the University of Leeds.
"From where it is squashed, which is more or less underneath Kathmandu, we get uplift. And where it stretches, which is in the high mountains to the north of Kathmandu in this case, we get subsidence.
"The biggest amount of slip on the fault was actually just north of Kathmandu, so it's the mountains north of Kathmandu that have subsided the most in this particular case."
Normally, the Himalayas are on the rise because of the collision between the Indian and Eurasian tectonic plates.
But during major earthquakes the process gets reversed, experts say.
"Between earthquake events, Nepal is being squashed and the part (including Kathmandu) nearest the big fault underneath it is being dragged down by the Indian plate, and [areas] further back are being lifted up as you imagine squashing something is going to push things up," says Prof Wright.
"Now, during the earthquake itself what happens is the opposite. The part that was dragged down because it was stuck at the fault - that slips freely and rebounds up, and the part that was being squashed upwards drops down."
Authorities in Nepal say they are yet to assess the impacts of the earthquake on the Himalayas as they are still occupied with rescue and rehabilitation after the devastating earthquake.(BBC)

Video: No-confidence motion against Ravi K next week: Bandula
	
The no-confidence motion against Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake was being finalized and would be submitted in parliament by next week, UPFA MP Bandula Gunawardane said.
Speaking at a media briefing this morning, MP Gunawardane said more than 90 MPs have already signed the motion and added that it was being finalized successfully.
He said several charges were made in the motion to which includes additions such as the financial transactions of Minister Karunanayake with Raj Rajaratnam who has been prosecuted in America for insider trading, misleading the finance market by making a statement that the Central bank Governor Arjun Mahendran was not guilty and that the government bond auction was done in a transparent manner while Mr. Mahendran was reappointed to the post even before an inquiry.
Mr. Gunawardane said they would request for a three-day debate from the Speaker before taking the vote on the no-confidence motion and added that a group of UNP MPs have also agreed to vote for the motion.(Ajith Siriwardana)WATCH

<U+200B>SL one of the worst offenders in protecting Journalists-IFJ
	
		 		 
		 
			
The International Federation of Journalists (IFJ) in its latest report said that Sri Lanka along with India, Pakistan and Afghanistan is among the ?worst offenders? in the region in protecting journalists in 2014-15.
?It also advocated a strong need for a campaign to end impunity to ensure that those who abduct, attack or kill journalists were brought to justice. "The 2014 Impunity Index, by Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ), had revealed that Sri Lanka, Afghanistan, Pakistan and India as the worst offenders on impunity in the region.?
?The situation, unfortunately, remains much the same but some significant progress has been made in the region to end impunity," the 13th annual IFJ report said.?
?While Sri Lanka did not experience any journalist deaths in the past year, several had close shaves. Even six years after the end of the war, the media in the Northern and Eastern Province of the island continue to face attacks and harassment,? the IFA stated.
?In India and Sri Lanka more women than men were reporters while 30 percent of the respondents were freelancers and women comprised 70 percent of them.
?Clearly, regular, full-time work is difficult to find throughout the region. In India 56 percent had full time work, in Pakistan 58 percent had full time jobs. In Sri Lanka only 48 percent had fulltime jobs. Sri Lanka too women dominated feature writing (64 percent) while men were likely to be columnists (30 percent). Women seem to be stereotyped as better suited to magazine journalism and feature writing ?identified as ?soft? news,? the survey said.
The report also said that journalists in Sri Lanka have lived for many years with civil strife, censorship, frequent attacks on journalists and a culture of impunity with perpetrators of violence invariably going unpunished. At least two prominent women editors continue to live in exile. Tamil journalists, including women are particularly vulnerable. In the north, in Tamil media, many women prefer desk jobs given the hazards of field reporting. However a few intrepid women have taken risks while reporting from conflict zones, the report?said.The Full Report
