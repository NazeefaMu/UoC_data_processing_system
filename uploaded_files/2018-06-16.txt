Commendable service at Department of Immigration and Emigration
	
I as a visitor to Sri Lanka and my wife as a citizen of this island made a visit to the Department of Immigration and Emigration in Battaramulla. The purpose was to extend my visa by two months and renew my wife?s passport, which is expiring shortly. When I entered the office I saw a large number of people who had come to obtain some kind of service. This worried me because the environment there suggested that it would take long for out work to be completed. However we learned that all types of services like issuing of passports, visas and also the national ID cards etc were centralised in the multi storied building and that was the reason for the large number of visitors to the office.? ?
At the entrance there was a large board specifying services rendered at different floors. We followed the directions and at the right counters and the courteous staff briefed us about the documents to be attached along with the applications, they handed over to us. After filling up the applications we followed the directions mentioned in the relevant floors and handed over same to a staffer, who after verifying the documents, issued a token through the electronic system. We were asked to be seated in a very comfortable and air-conditioned hall and await our turn. When my turn arrived I met the Assistant Controller (a famel) who, with all smiles, received me and after inquiring about the reason for extending my visa, approved the same and advised me to proceed to another room to make the payment. I followed the instructions, made the payment and in half an hour?s time got my Passport stamped with the visa. I was also shocked when they returned my original application saying it wasn?t required any more. A real electronic storing system which cuts down accumulation of papers!? ?
My wife had the same experience when she went through the process of renewing her Passport. I was also surprised when her number was called because the system had a way of flashing her photograph. It?s amazing how this nation uses advanced technology!? ?
I highly appreciate the orderliness and the fast service rendered to thousands of people every day. Even if the commuters have to wait for a while, they can spend their time comfortably in the office and if necessary buy quality food and beverages at a reasonable price at the food outlets in the floors, kept clean and neat. The manner in which this institute is managed serves as a boon to mothers who visit the office with their children.? ?
?I salute the controllers and their staff for their pleasing manners and efficacy in serving the public with all sincerity and duty-consciousness.? ?

Delaying trial for 12 years: SC orders CTC to pay widow Rs.400,000 as costs
	
The Supreme Court in a landmark judgment, on Thursday, ordered the Ceylon Tobacco Company (CTC) to pay Rs.400,000 as costs to a smoker's widow after the company was found to have prolonged the trial for more than 12 years by filing petitions in the Appeal Court and the SC.
Chief Justice Priyasath Dep concurring with Justices Sisira J. De Abrew and Prasanna Jayawardena held that the District Court should hear and determine the trial on its merit as soon as possible and dismissed the appeal filed by CTC and affirmed the Orders of District Court and the Court of Appeal.
The SC observed that the CTC had succeeded in delaying the case in the District Court for more than 12 years causing the widow to incur expenses which would have been to her a heavy burden and a considerable inconvenience.
It said these obstacles might have even prompted the plaintiff, probably with limited resources to be discouraged and giving up on the legal action.
The plaintiff Lalitha Padmini Fernando was the widow of K.S. Perera, a tailor, who had started smoking when he was a teenager. In September 1996, he was diagnosed with incurable cancer and died on April 13, 2001 at the age of 60.
Prior to his death, he had instituted legal action in the Colombo District Court against the Ceylon Tobacco Company to recover damages on account of suffering from cancer allegedly caused by smoking cigarettes manufactured by the company.
On April 11, 2003, the plaintiff instituted legal action against CTC pleading four alleged causes of action and seeking Rs.5 million from the CTC.
Manoj Bandara with T. Herath instructed by Sudath Perera Associates appeared for the CTC while Kanishka Witharana with H.M. Tillakaratne instructed by Medha N. Gamage appeared for plaintiff Lalitha Padmini Fernando. (S.S. Selvanayagam)

Gotabhaya Rajapaksa's US Citizenship and Presidential Ambition
	
?
By
D.B.S.Jeyaraj
The United States Ambassador to Sri Lanka Atul Keshap will conclude his three-year term in Colombo this August. He will be succeeded by Alaina B. Teplitz, the current US Ambassador to Nepal. Both Keshap and Teplitz were appointed envoys to Sri Lanka and Nepal respectively by former US President Barack Obama in March 2015. Both, however, are US Foreign Service career Officials and not political appointees of President Obama.
Ambassador Keshap is currently winding up his duties in Sri Lanka gradually and bidding ?Gihila Ennang/Poaittu Vaaraen?.
He has been making a number of courtesy calls to prominent Sri Lankan leaders and dignitaries to bid au revoir.
?
The newspaper speculated that Mahinda Rajapaksa would have been dazed as the US envoy?s pronouncements meant Gotabhaya Rajapaksa could not revoke US citizenship and contest the presidential election in the near future
?
Very few of these farewell meetings - seen as a routine matter - were publicised in the Sri Lankan media. One such meeting however received wide publicity last week.
This was when Atul Keshap paid a courtesy call on former President Mahinda Rajapaksa at his Wijerama Mawatha residence on Sunday, June 10th. The main reason for this was a newspaper report stating that the proposed Presidential candidacy of ex-Defence Secretary and Mahinda?s sibling Gotabhaya Rajapaksa figured prominently at the one to one talks.
Interestingly enough the story about the Mahinda-Atul meeting was not broken by any newspaper published in Colombo. It was the Jaffna based Tamil Daily Kaalaikkathir (Morning Ray) of June 12th, 2018 which scooped the story.
The Kaalaikkathir in an exclusive report by a ?Special Political Correspondent? published as the lead story revealed details of the meeting between Rajapaksa and Keshap. The newspaper cited ?Miha miha nambikkaiyaana vattaarangal? (Very, very trustworthy circles) as the source of the news story.
The newspaper, which commenced publication two years ago, is edited by Senior Tamil Journalist Nadesapillai Vithyatharan, who earlier edited the Tamil newspapers Uthayan and Sudar Oli.
Vithyatharan is also the brother in law of TNA Jaffna District Parliamentarian E. Saravanabavaan, who owns the Uthayan and Sudar Oli newspapers. There is little love lost between the brothers-in-law nowadays.
The Kaalaikkathir has made a name for itself within a relatively short span of time. Although prone to a certain degree of sensationalism (Somewhat understandable in a competitive climate) the paper has published some very good news stories in the past.
Some of these have been about the Ruhunu Rajapaksas. The tone and tenor of these news items could result in the discerning reader concluding that the newspaper has some good contacts within the Rajapaksa clan.
Editor Vithyatharan is believed to be one of the few Tamil journalists, who interact closely with Mahinda Rajapaksa, Namal Rajapaksa and possibly Basil Rajapaksa.
Mahinda Rajapaksa - Atul Keshap Meeting
According to details disclosed by the Jaffna daily the meeting between Mahinda Rajapaksa and Atul Keshap was held on Sunday, June 10th at the ex-president?s residence.
The talks were conducted in a cordial atmosphere and dealt with a number of relevant matters. Among these, the most significant issue was about the possible Presidential candidacy of ex-Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa. Kaalaikkathir, quoting very reliable sources said that the US envoy had in ?clear, unambiguous and definite? terms told Mahinda Rajapaksa directly that the Western Nations, including the USA, would not favourably regard Mr Gotabhaya Rajapaksa being nominated as a Presidential candidate.
?
Ambassador Keshap had bluntly told Mahinda Rajapaksa that the US and West would not be in favour of a person like Gotabhaya Rajapaksa becoming Sri Lanka?s leader and won?t welcome his contesting the presidency
?
The newspaper went on to say that Atul Keshap had reportedly stated the international community was looking forward to a person with political maturity and experience, which could interact effectively within the sphere of democratic politics to be the leader of the country.
The US envoy had emphasised that crushing terrorism with an iron hand during times of conflict and engaging in governance within a functioning political democracy were two different things.
Ambassador Keshap had bluntly told Mahinda Rajapaksa that the US and West would not be in favour of a person like Gotabhaya Rajapaksa becoming Sri Lanka?s leader and won?t welcome his contesting the presidency.
The Kaalaikkathir also stated that Gotabhaya Rajapaksa was required to renounce his US citizenship to be a Presidential candidate because a dual citizen was constitutionally debarred from contesting the Sri Lankan Presidency.
However, the newspaper said that current US laws would not permit Gotabhaya Rajapaksa to renounce US citizenship at this juncture.
Gotabhaya Rajapaksa needed to clear himself of allegations against him before the US would allow him to renounce US citizenship formally.?
It is only after he is cleared fully that the US would let him renounce citizenship and be eligible to contest Parliamentary or Presidential elections reported the newspaper.
Kaalaikkathir did not say what Mahinda Rajapaksa?s response to the US ambassador was.
However, the newspaper speculated that Mahinda Rajapaksa would have been dazed as the US envoy?s pronouncements meant Gotabhaya Rajapaksa could not revoke US citizenship and contest the presidential election in the near future.
?
Nineteenth Constitutional Amendment
As is well-known that the 19th Constitutional amendment forbids a dual citizen from contesting Parliamentary or Presidential elections. It is widely believed that the provision was a pre-emptive move to prevent Gotabaya Rajapaksa from seeking electoral office.
The Nineteenth Constitutional Amendment has reversed the Eighteenth Amendment and blocked Mahinda Rajapaksa from contesting for the Presidency again.
If the envisaged new Constitution materialises and the Executive Presidency is abolished and the Prime Ministerial office is further empowered, then Mahinda Rajapaksa can or may seek Prime Ministerial office.
If however, the diluted Executive Presidency continued to remain then an alternative to Mahinda has to be found. Many think the alternative is Gotabaya. In recent times the Gotabaya fan club has been working overtime promoting the retired Army Colonel as the prospective presidential candidate.
As of now, Gotabaya Rajapaksa is a dual citizen, holding US citizenship. His only son is well-settled in the US.
If Gota is to contest the Presidential or Parliamentary poll in the future, he would have to give up his US citizenship. In spite of critically denouncing the US at times, Gotabaya has not shown any inclination to renounce his US citizenship so far.?
A few years ago, when Gota addressed the Foreign Correspondents Association in Colombo the ex-Defence Secretary was non-committal about renouncing US citizenship and entering active politics.
Mahinda too has not been too enthusiastic about Gota contesting polls to date.
Of late, however, Gota has demonstrated a clear interest in contesting.
Two organizations namely Eliya and Viyath Maga are actively endorsing his Presidential bid. In addition, there are groups of retired Defence Service personnel engaging in organizing efforts to promote his candidacy.
?
Gotabhaya Rajapaksa needed to clear himself of allegations against him before the US would allow him to renounce US citizenship formally
?
Gota outlined an economic vision for Sri Lanka recently. He has also been attending Ifthar ceremonies with the intention of establishing amicable relations with the Muslim voters.
He has also indicated that he would renounce US citizenship to contest polls at the appropriate time.
Since Ex-Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa is both a citizen of Sri Lanka and the USA, he has said that he would renounce his US citizenship, if selected as a Presidential Candidate.
Although an orchestrated campaign was launched in support of Gotabhaya Rajapaksa?s Presidential Candidacy,?
no definite decision about Gota?s candidacy has been taken by the Opposition party groups, supportive of Mahinda Rajapaksa so far.
?
Common Joint Opposition Candidate
The ex-President himself is yet to give the green light explicitly for his sibling to contest. One of the reasons attributed this was perceived opposition within sections of the Rajapaksa family circle to Gota being the Presidential candidate.
In recent times there have been media reports that the Rajapaksa clan had arrived at a united decision and that the common Joint Opposition candidate at the next Presidential poll would be Gotabhaya Rajapaksa.
It is against this backdrop that outgoing US envoy Atul Keshap reportedly dropped a political bombshell, which may possibly destroy Gotabhaya Rajapaksa?s hopes of being the 7th President of Sri Lanka.
Even before the Mahinda-Atul meeting, the Sri Lankan political grapevine has been buzzing with the news that the USA would not allow Gotabhaya Rajapaksa to contest the next Presidential poll in Sri Lanka.
Since Gota needs to have his US citizenship revoked to be eligible to contest the Presidential poll, the rumour mills have been working overtime that the US would not permit that.
It is being said that the US would block or delay matters if and when Gotabhaya Rajapaksa tried to renounce US citizenship. I myself have heard this viewpoint from multiple sources reflecting different shades of political opinion like the UNP, SLFP, TNA, SLMC, TPA, SLPP and the Joint Opposition.
The Gota Kalliya or Group Supporting Gotabhaya Rajapaksa?s Presidential candidacy have succeeded in propagating the impression that the success of the Gota juggernaut at the next Presidential Poll was inevitable.
This has made the people in rival political camps quite jittery. More importantly, the thinking sections among the people, who are aware of the dangers in a return or revival of an emasculated democracy that existed under the Rajapaksa regime, are extremely concerned about an electoral triumph of Gota.
The only silver lining they perceive in a dark cloud is the anticipated US role in thwarting Gota?s presidential ambition.?
Even the left-leaning progressives who have been traditionally critical of ?US imperialism? see ?Uncle Sam?s intervention? as the sole impediment to Gota?s political journey.
?
Sunanda Deshapriya?s Gotabhaya Perahera
A striking illustration of this growing mindset was provided by well-known journalist and media rights activist Sunanda Deshapriya. The former editor of Yukthiya now writes a weekly column in the Sinhala journal Ravaya.
Sunanda wrote a column on June 3rd titled? Gotabhaya Perahera.
An English translation of relevant paragraphs at the tail -end of the article is reproduced here-
?The decision of the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) to oppose 20th Amendment proposed by the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) indicates that Gotabhaya?s Presidential aim has begun to be its political focus. As it seems for now, whether Mahinda Rajapaksa likes it or not, Gotabhaya will be the presidential candidate of the Pohottu party.?
?The main factor, which can stop this probability, is in the hands of USA. If American State machinery takes steps to delay Gotabhaya?s request to rescind his American citizenship, Gota?s Presidential dream will be shattered.
In this sense, the power to raise or close the curtain of Gotabhaya perahera (procession/parade) is in the hands of American imperialism.
What an irony, that the destiny of Gotabhaya, who is aspiring to be the warmongering, nationalist and populist dictator of Sri Lanka, now rests in the hands of Western politics, which is the main political enemy of populist Rajapaksa politics!
?
Udaya Gammanpila?s Press Conference
Conscious perhaps of this growing expectation among sections of the people that he would not be able to renounce US citizenship and be eligible to contest the Presidential poll, Gotabhaya Rajapaksa felt the need to set the record straight on this issue.
He had to convey to the nation at large that renouncing his US citizenship was not an issue and that doing so was a very simple procedure without any hassle.
Pivithuru Hela Urumaya (PHU) leader and Colombo district MP Udaya Gammanpila was asked to clarify that US citizenship was not a barrier for Gota to contest the Presidential poll.
Udaya Gammanpila conducted a press briefing at 2.30 p.m. on Monday, June 11th, 2018, during which he said that Mr Gotabhaya Rajapaksa had requested him to explain the true legal position and the procedure in respect of renunciation of the US citizenship.
Interestingly the press briefing took place just one day after the Mahinda Rajapaksa -Atul Keshap meeting.
A communique outlining the legal position on a US citizen renouncing his citizenship status was issued at Gammanpila?s media briefing.
It is reproduced in?full here - ?After the 19th Amendment, dual citizens are barred from contesting Presidential Election. Hence, the Government being suffered from Gota-phobia spread rumours that US Government has rejected Gota?s application for the renunciation of US citizenship. Some say the US Government would sit on the application until the conclusion of the Presidential Election and renunciation of the citizenship would be accepted soon after the election. He will then lose both citizenship and the candidacy. In the backdrop of these rumours, Mr Gotabaya Rajapaksa requested me to explain the true legal position and the procedure in respect of renunciation of the US citizenship.?
?Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 is the governing law in respect of renunciation of citizenship. According to Section 349(a)(5) of the Act, any citizen who wishes to relinquish the citizenship can do so without any restriction. However, two restrictions have been introduced by case law. Firstly, if the citizen lodges the application, being in the USA, it will definitely be rejected. Secondly, if the applicant does not have any other citizenship, his application may be rejected.?
?In this backdrop, the first step towards renouncing US citizenship is obtaining citizenship in another country. The second step is collecting requirements mentioned in form DS4079 to DS4083. Thirdly, the applicant should make the renunciation appointment with the US embassy.?
?
As it seems for now, whether Mahinda Rajapaksa likes it or not, Gotabhaya will be the presidential candidate of the Pohottu party.?
?
Certificate of Loss of Nationality
?As the fourth step, you should attend the appointment with two persons to witness your signature. After briefing you about the consequences of renunciation of the citizenship, the documents will be executed. Thereafter, you will be issued with DS4083, Certificate of Loss of Nationality. It is like an insurance cover note or temporary driving licence. It will be later replaced with a certificate issued by the Department of State. It is so simple and so quick. Therefore, with great responsibility, I am telling you that, US Citizenship would not be a bar in any manner for Mr Gotabaya Rajapaksa to contest the forthcoming Presidential Election.?

Govt. like a bull and buffalo-drawn plough: MR
	
Former president Mahinda Rajapaksa yesterday compared the government to a plough being drawn by a bull and a buffalo.
He said this after paying homage at the Dalada Maligawa and underlined the fact that this government would be defeated because it had not solved any of the issues faced by the people and had no proper plan of development.
?This government is similar to a plough being drawn by a bull and a buffalo. They pull in different directions. It is unable to control underworld activities not only in Colombo but also in Kandy,? he said. ?The Kirivehera prelate was shot. They can find out who shot him by asking the prelate, who is said to be recovering. Someone may have had a reason to kill him. The social media is coming out with various fabricated news and are falsely accusing Gotabaya Rajapaksa of having committed various crimes."
Mr. Rajapaksa said religious leaders were also being side-lined by this government.
?The Vesak Poya Day was changed, New Year was changed, and even the Poson Poya has been changed. There is even an issue about the Ramadhan festival. All religions have been ill treated,? he said and added that usually matters discussed between a foreign ambassador and a state official were not normally released, but it had happened with various interpretations.
Mr. Rajapaksa said a presidential candidate would be named at the correct time, just like President Sirisena who came into the fray quite suddenly.
?The presidential candidate will be named under my directions,? he said. (J. A. L. Jayasinghe and Chandana Uduwawala)

Honour your mother and father
	
?
Sri Lanka?s Islamic community celebrates Ramadan today, after almost one month of sacrificial and selfless fasting and prayer, in addition to sharing with the poverty-stricken or marginalised people. While wishing them showers of blessings on this day, we hope and pray that our country also will be blessed to bring about inter-religious and inter-racial unity in diversity. We hope this blessing will change the attitude and approach especially of our leaders, so that they will work with honesty and integrity, in a spirit of selfless, sincere and sacrificial service to the people. This blessing will help us take a major step towards building a society that is just, peaceful and all-inclusive. Among those excluded from the mainstream and decision-making processes of society are those caught up in the poverty-trap of a wicked world and also the elderly or the senior citizens some of whom are confined to elder?s homes or not given the proper place in their own homes while they have little or no say in decision-making.? ?
Restoring the dignity of the elders is one of the important areas where all religions could work together. An all-religions? solidarity alliance could also play a vital role in poverty alleviation through a more equitable distribution of wealth and resources, in the battle against global warming which is threatening to destroy Planet Earth and in the worldwide campaign for nuclear disarmament.? ?
We referred mainly to the plight of elders, because yesterday was the United Nations? World Elder Abuse Awareness Day. According to the UN, between 2015 and 2030, virtually all countries are expected to see substantial growth in the number of senior citizens and that growth will be faster in developing regions. Because the numbers of senior citizens are growing, it is feared that the extent of elder abuse may grow with it.? ?
The UN says that, while the taboo topic of elder abuse has started to gain visibility across the world, it remains one of the least investigated types of violence in national surveys, and one of the least addressed in national action plans. Elder abuse is a global social issue which affects the health and human rights of millions of senior citizens around the world. The UN, in a resolution, designated June 15 as the World Elder Abuse Awareness Day. It represents the one day in the year when the whole world voices its opposition to the abuse and suffering inflicted on some of our older generations.?
The UN has also given some facts which should shock a world that is not only suffering from self-centredness and wickedness, but also puts on a face that befits hypocrites and sanctimonious humbugs. Around 1 in 6 senior citizens experienced some form of abuse in the past year, rates of abuse may be higher for those living in institutions than in the community; elder abuse can lead to serious physical injuries and long-term psychological consequences; elder abuse is predicted to increase as many countries are experiencing rapidly ageing populations; the global population of people aged 60 and older will more than double from 900 million in 2015 to about 2 billion in 2050.? ?
The UN says, elder abuse can be defined as a single, or repeated act, or lack of appropriate action, occurring within any relationship where there is an expectation of trust. This causes harm or distress to an older person. Elder abuse can take various forms such as physical, psychological or emotional, sexual and financial abuse. It can also be the result of intentional or unintentional neglect. In many parts of the world, elder abuse occurs with little recognition or response. Until recently, this serious social problem was hidden from the public view and considered mostly a private matter. Even today, elder abuse continues to be a taboo, mostly underestimated and ignored by societies across the world. Evidence is accumulating, however, to indicate that elder abuse is an important public health and societal problem.? ?
In Sri Lanka, with a hollowed civilization dating back to more than 2500 years, parental care needs to be part of a good family life, whatever religion we practice. We hope that the middle-aged citizens and younger generation will reflect deeply on the virtues and values of caring for their parents, mainly when they are elderly, and often ailing.? ?

India?s air pollution not just a winter problem

Hindustan Times (New Delhi), Jun 15 2018? -? The unusually high concentration of particulate matter in the last few days in north India clearly shows that air pollution is not a seasonal problem anymore.? ?
As the climate gets warmer and frequency of rains reduces, such spurts in coarse particles making breathing difficult will become a new normal, unless governments wake up to the alarm.? ?
The latest assessment report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change says that the planet can bear only up to a 1.5 to 2 degrees Celsius increase in temperature from pre-industrial era levels.? ?
The Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology , in series of papers, said that both the periodicity and duration of dry spells in the country were rising as total rainfall events in a year had fallen even though the average rainfall in a year has not changed much, a direct consequence of?
climate change.? ?
The annual average rainfall has remained the same because the frequency of heavy downpours has increased in the past?

Land swindle in Knuckles Range: Ministry sends auditors to inspect site
	
The Public Enterprise and Kandy City Development Ministry has sent a team of auditors to inquire into the alleged transfer of 21,000 acres of land in the Knuckles Mountain Range to close associates of government ministers, Ministry Secretary Ravindra Hewavitharana told Daily Mirror.
He said the auditors were accompanied by officials of the Department of Forest Conservation, Grama Niladharis, Superintendents and officials of the related companies and residents of the area.
?The auditors visited inspected the area on Thursday. The ministry will receive a report on their return next week. The team has reached the site with the coordination of Global Positioning System (GPS),? Mr. Hewavitharana said.
Earlier, the Movement for Land and Agriculture Reform (MONLAR) claimed that these lands which were managed by State Plantations Corporation and Elkaduwa Plantation Limited had been given to close associates and relatives of two powerful ministers.
MONLAR member and environmentalist Sajeewa Chamikara said 6,192 of the 9,675 hectares belonged to the State Plantations Corporation and 2,363 of the 3,693 hectares belonged to Elkaduwa Plantation Limited. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)

Obama was a light Trump is of the night
	
?
Put America First?Trump blindsided them with talk of dismantling free trade
	The Very blue-collar workers who tipped the scales in Donald Trump?s victory
	Many now worrying Trump will win re-election in three years? time
?
Politics is a fickle beast. Barack Obama won more votes among blue-collar workers than did his opponent, Senator John McCain. But it was those very blue-collar workers who tipped the scales in Donald Trump?s victory. They weren?t racists or they wouldn?t have voted for Obama in the first place.
But in voting for Trump they voted against their economic interest. Trump hasn?t and won?t help the health of the poorer, nor improve income inequality, nor in the long run give them jobs that now have migrated to China, India and Europe.
What he did give these voters was a sense of pride in being American, as Obama did, but Hilary Clinton couldn?t.
?Put America First?, he shouted again and again. Trump blindsided them with talk of dismantling free trade. Even though events and the long run would show he has shot America in the foot, it sounded convincing.?
Obama would have won a third term if allowed to run. He had more appeal across the electorate than Trump. It was Mrs Clinton who lost it.
Obama was the most successful liberal, Democratic, President since Franklin Roosevelt who ushered in the New Deal, a campaign to save the poorest from the Great Depression.
Some would say since Lyndon Johnson with his great civil rights and poverty reforms, but he can?t be called liberal after the carnage he inflicted on Southeast Asia.
Bill Clinton was a centrist cum conservative and he re-organised welfare so that the poor were badly hit- a policy he now says he regrets. Jimmy Carter was more successful than his many critics allow, but still, his great achievements were in foreign, not domestic policy.
Many observers are now worrying that Trump will win re-election in three years? time. But remember 2006 when a book, ?One Party Country ? was published. It was about how George W. Bush and Karl Rove, were ?on the cusp of building a permanent Republican Majority that would rule politics till the end of time?.
So writes Dan Pfeiffer, Obama?s communications director, in his fascinating new book;
?Yes, We (Still) Can?. He writes that soon after the Bush book was published the Democrats took back the House and the Senate in a landslide. Two years after that Obama won a huge electoral victory, capturing states that no Democrat had won in decades.
The Pfeiffer book is a testament to a great leader. But it is more than that. Pfeiffer, like his ex-boss, believes that there are ?reasons to believe hope is right around the corner?- what Obama would call ?The Audacity Of Hope.?
There?s no need to believe the Republican rhetoric about Trump being a leader who can keep them in a permanent majority.
Pfeiffer reminds us of a speech Obama made at the 50th anniversary of Martin Luther King?s March on Washington.
Obama spoke from the very spot where King had made his ?I have a Dream? speech. In a masterful sermon Obama slightly re-wrote King:
?The arc of the universe may bend towards justice, but it doesn?t bend on its own.? If the next Democratic candidate can learn from Obama?s experience he or she will win the Presidency.
Above all, it means inspiring young people to vote and persuading the blue-collar workers who defected to Trump to return to the Democratic fold. And, it means, as Pfeiffer explains so well, mastering the media at a time when Fox News dominates an extremely large audience, not as a traditional bipartisan TV channel but as a 100% propagandistic supporter of the Republican philosophy. And it means realizing that the media world is ?in the midst of a massive, rapid, disruptive transformation that is re-writing all the rules of politics and presidential communications?.
A major part of the media- apart from Fox, the New York Times and Washington Post- is floundering because of the effects of the 2008 financial crisis, which had the effect of drastically lowering the advertising that was necessary if the media was to be adequately funded. The internet and the smartphone have taken over.
One more book, more cerebral, has also recently been published called, ?The Presidency of Barak Obama?.
It?s a series of essays some supportive, some critical. But the overall conclusion is of a great success. ?Obama obtained support for the Affordable Care Act (which Trump hasn?t been able to tear up), the Dodd-Frank financial regulation, an economic stimulus bill that pulled the nation out of a very deep recession, and a burst of domestic legislation, unlike the nation, had seen in years. The cumulative effect was to make great progress in diminishing inequality?.
Obama was a light. Trump is of the night. Much of what you need to know for the future is in these two books, in particular where the light switch is.?

Over 1,500 sacks of airmail stuck at BIA

PC polls unlikely this year: Musthapha
	
The elections to six provincial councils are not likely this year because political parties are apprehensive of the outcome following the experience gained at the February local government polls, Local Government and Provincial Councils Minister Faizer Musthapha said yesterday.
He said delimitation report has to be debated and approved prior to any elections to the PCs and rejected certain media reports that he had agreed to hold the PC polls under the old system.
The minister said neither he nor the President had agreed to hold the PC polls under the old system.
?We have committed ourselves to holding the PC polls under the new electoral system because it is an election pledge given to people and because we are determined to do away with the much criticized preferential voting system that has led to election violence, corruption and the violation of the election law,? he said. "The President has instructed me to expedite the approval of the delimitation report in Parliament and pave the way for early polls. But this has not happened because the party leaders are undecided. The new Act passed with a two-thirds majority also requires the delimitation report to be passed in Parliament within a month since being tabled. This has not happened. I tabled the report on February 19, 2018."
The minister said he met party leaders before the New Year to discuss the elections to the Sabaragamuwa, North-Central and Eastern Provincial Councils.
He said if the PC polls were to be held under the old system, we must go back to Parliament and get its approval. (Sandun A Jayasekera)

President asks group of 16 to remain united
	
President Maithripala Sirisena is reported to have requested the 16 Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) members, who quit the government, to remain united amid reports about a split among the them.
Eleven of the 16, excluding MPs Susil Premajayantha, John Seneviratne, Anura Priyadarshana Yapa and John Seneviratne had met the President on Wednesday and discussed the current political situation in the country.
Some among them are said to be considering joining former president Mahinda Rajapaksa, while the others insist on remaining with the SLFP.
Political sources said they had informed the President that they were keen to secure their political future, and therefore the entire party should quit the government and highlighted the fact that the SLFP was riddled with confusion.
The President asked them to remain united and participate in the re-organising of the party. These SLFPers are reported to have taken a swipe at Ministers Duminda Dissanayake and Mahinda Amaraweera for contradicting a statement made by SLFP General Secretary Rohana Lakshman Piyadasa.

SLFPers can join SLPP on an individual basis: Basil
	
Former minister Basil Rajapaksa, who spearheads the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP), ruled out the possibility of accommodating the members of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) as a distinct political group under the SLPP banner.
However, he said the MPs who quit the government could join the SLPP-led alliance as individual members rather than as a separate political group.
?It is not possible for us to allow them to stay within the SLPP as a separate political group. Instead, they can join hands with us as individual members,? he said. (Kelum Bandara)
