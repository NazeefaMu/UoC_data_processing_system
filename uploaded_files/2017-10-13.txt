A guide  to reduce  breast cancer risk
	
Breast Cancer Prevention Awareness Month?
?
Senior Dietitian Fahma Sunarja at Parkway Cancer Centre talks about how a nutritious diet can help women reduce the risk of breast cancer.??
There are many myths and misconceptions associated with how food can help you avoid getting breast cancer, or how eating the wrong things can lead to it.??
Many of them stem from studies linking certain foods to cancer, or traditional beliefs about the efficacy of certain diets and treatment. Various forms of ?anti-inflammatory? diets have also been touted based on the idea that constant or uncontrolled inflammation in the body can lead to poor health and higher risk of cancer.??
Ultimately, it is impossible to determine exactly what can help you avoid cancer, because there are so many factors related to its causes.??
However, according to the World Cancer Research Fund and the American Institute for Cancer Research, there are some things you can do about your diet that can help you reduce the risk of getting cancer.??
These include consuming less energy-dense foods such as cake, pastries, candy, chocolate, and sweets (sugary drinks such as sweetened drinks and carbonated drinks), red meat and processed meat (food that has been preserved and processed, such as salted and smoked foods) mouldy cereals, grains, pulses and alcohol.??
?
?
EAT LESS OF THESE
?
Eat less energy-dense foods such as cake, pastries, candy, chocolate and sweets.??
	Avoid sugary drinks such as sweetened drinks and carbonated drinks.??
	Eat less red meat and avoid processed meat.??
	Limit your alcohol intake. Men shouldn?t drink more than two standard drinks a day, and women, one. A standard drink is 300 ml of beer, 100 ml of wine, or 30 ml of spirits.??
	Eat less food that has been preserved and processed, such as salted and smoked foods. Avoid mouldy cereals, grains and pulses.??
	Be careful with dietary supplements. Try to meet your nutritional needs through your diet alone and take supplements only when necessary.? ? ?
?
While many people take dietary supplements, dietitians advise meeting your nutritional needs through your diet alone. Some of these recommendations are based on studies which reveal that the presence of certain toxins in food can increase the risk of cancer. These toxins are found either naturally occurring in certain foods, or are formed when food is prepared in a certain way.??
They include aflatoxin in cereals, grains and peanuts (fumonisin in maize), heterocyclic amines, formed when meat is cooked at high temperatures, such as deep frying (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons), which are produced in meat and fish that has been grilled or barbecued over direct flame; and N-nitroso, which are found in foods that contain added nitrates or nitrites ? for example, in meat and fish preserved with salt or by smoking or drying.??
Conversely, eating plant-based foods has been linked to a reduction in the risk of cancer.??
In recent years, much attention has been focused on what some call ?superfoods?, which are believed to help fight cancer. They include blueberries, turmeric, broccoli, walnuts and garlic. Do they really prevent cancer? It is hard to be sure, but what is known is that these foods contain phytonutrients, antioxidants, vitamins and other elements that, when combined with a balanced diet, is part of healthy eating that may reduce the risk of cancer.??
Some have also linked alcohol to breast cancer. There are several ways in which alcohol can indeed raise the risk of cancer.??
Ethanol is broken down in the alcoholic drink to acetaldehyde, a toxic chemical and a probable cancer-causing carcinogen.??
Acetaldehyde can also damage your DNA (the genetic material that makes up your genes), proteins and lipids (fats) through a process called oxidation. Alcohol may also increase blood levels of estrogen, a sex hormone linked to the risk of a certain breast cancer.??
Alcoholic beverages may also contain a variety of carcinogenic contaminants that are introduced during fermentation and production, such as nitrosamines, asbestos fibres, phenols and hydrocarbons.??
Some also believe that eating more genetically modified (GM) food instead of organic food can increase the risk of cancer. There is broad scientific consensus, however, that GM crops don?t pose a greater risk to health than conventional food.??
?
?
DO MORE OF THESE:
Stay lean. Keep your weight down, within the normal range. This can be assessed using the BMI (Body Mass Index) as a guide.??
?
Keep active physically. Avoid a sedentary lifestyle and exercise regularly. In general, you should try to do some form of exercise for at least 150 minutes a week, or half an hour each day, five times a week. Try to include strength training exercises at least two days a week.??
?
Eat more plant-based food.?
?
?
Some believe that eating more organic produce will reduce exposure to toxins and GM material. While they can be included in your diet, organic food may spoil faster and may contain more biotoxins as herbicides and fungicides aren?t used.??
In the end, the most important advice that women should follow is this: Go for regular screening, adopt a healthier lifestyle, eat well, be physically active, and manage stress.?
?
?
Nutrition during treatment??
If you have been affected by breast cancer and are undergoing treatment, good nutrition will help you overcome some side-effects and maintain energy levels.??
Many of the guidelines for healthy eating are applicable during treatment as well. These include cutting down the consumption of sugar and processed meat. On the other hand, red meat such as beef and lamb do provide nutrients like iron, zinc and vitamin B12. These aren?t found in white meat, but are important in forming red blood cells and haemoglobin.??
One common advice is that we should replace our intake of sugar with honey. To be sure, honey has some health benefits. Apart from containing vitamins and minerals like vitamin C, iron, calcium and phosphate, honey also has anti-bacterial, anti-fungal and anti-oxidant properties. However, if you are undergoing active treatment such as chemotherapy, radiation therapy or stem cell transplantation, honey may not be safe. This is because most honey isn?t pasteurised and may therefore contain pollens or even bacteria that could cause an allergy or infection.??
Many types of supplements are also touted on the market that promise various benefits, but do exercise caution when choosing them. For example, make sure that they don?t contain more nutrients and minerals than what is recommended. It may be best to avoid antioxidant pills during treatment, although supplements that focus on enhancing immunity are generally safe. Whatever supplement you are taking, discuss it with your oncologist or dietitian to make sure that you aren?t taking unnecessary pills.??

BahuChithawadiya alias smooth operator and  anti-hero
	
Credit is due to this young film maker for making an intelligent movie. The challenge now is to find an intelligent audience
The acting is excellent. Sasitha?s victims are played by Veena Jayakody, Damitha Hemachandra, Sulochana Withanachchi and Geetha Alahakoon
Malaka Devapriya?s debut feature ?Bahuchithavadiya? (The Undecided) could do with another title. ?Smooth operator? would aptly describe the film?s main character, a young delivery rider called Sasitha. He has affairs with four women, ranging from young to middle-aged, and director/script writer Devapriya makes an entertaining, highly intelligent comedy about this universal character.? ?
The discussion which followed the screening at the Tharangani cinema on Sunday was interesting, but those among the audience who voiced their views missed the main point about the film. One said this was the second turning point in Sri Lankan cinema, the first being Dharmasena Pathiraja?s ?Ahas Gawwa.? Others spoke of how it captured the frustrations of youth, speaking out for an entire generation as Ahas Gawwa did.? ?But Bahuchithavadiya is nothing of the kind. What it does is to introduce a new type of anti-hero as its main protagonist, a type new to Sri Lankan cinema. Whether this is a turning point or not is matter of debate. Incidentally, there is rarely any talk, if ever, if ?Battleship Potemkin? was a turning point in Soviet Cinema or Citizen Kane was that for the Americans, or Pather Panchali transformed Indian cinema or if Rashomon was a turning point for the Japanese. But Sri Lanka is obsessed with turning points. It looks as if we are spinning or turning once every decade or so. At any rate, our cinema does.? ?
??Bahuchithawadiya? is about the frustrations of a particular youth. Sasitha (Kalana Gunasekara) isn?t just a womaniser. He has picked up the not-so-fine art of living off women, several at a time, and here we have a universal character which occurs in all ages, countries and cultures. It perpetuates the myth that women are more gullible than men. As anyone who has successfully gotten through Kindergarten knows, it isn?t just women who are gullible when it comes to being conned. Confidence tricksters find their victims without any gender bias. In this context, though, women end up with both their purses and bodies preyed upon.? ?
?Malaka Dewapriya winning the Best film Cinema of Tomorrow award for his film ?Bahuchitawadiya? at the 5th Derana Sunsilk Film Awards 2017.?
In the film, four women are being tricked and fleeced by this predator. Ultimately, he?s the biggest victim, because the women have different motives for selecting him for their favours, from genuine love and affection to sexual gratification and companionship in their lonely lives. That?s the principal difference between Malaka Devapriya?s principal character and Pathiraja?s down-and-out dreamers. They are decent young men. They don?t prey upon lonely women just because they are sexually frustrated. Instead of preying upon widows, divorcees and spinsters, they start smuggling watches from the harbour due to sheer desperation. Because of that innate sense of decency, a generation of young men could identify themselves with Pathiraja?s characters.? ?
But Sasitha in Bahuchithavadiya is different. He has no sense of decency (unless Pathiraja?s characters, he has a job). If viewers could identify themselves with that character, then what we have would be a deeply troubled society in need of rehabilitation. That?s why Bahuchithavadiya can?t be the voice for any generation. In this context, as it was the case in mine, most young men focus on finding one suitable partner to share one?s life with. It was hard enough then and it?s still hard despite most people now having 300 or 600 or 3000 ?notifications? on Face Book. Decency is still a valued, but rare quality. That?s why Face Book is just a game of cards with smiling faces imprinted on them, and winners are rare. It?s all about shuffling without results. Occasionally, though, con artists like Sasitha score because that?s how Murphy?s Law works in such cases.? ?
Those who made a living out of snaring women have always been exotic curiosities in any generation. But they are universal characters, with inherently more dramatic value than the long-suffering husband who raises a family on moonshine jobs and loans, worrying about heart attacks all the time and eventually dying of cirrhosis of the liver or type two diabetes (nowadays from thirty plus).?
?
This is where this film?s success lies. Sasitha is an original character in Sri Lankan cinema. That?s a real breakthrough. There have been conmen before, but not on this scale and intensity. Sasitha is an intelligent young man who is inherently lazy. He is too lazy to support his struggling sister and her home-based dressmaking business. His voice is lazy. So are his body, his gaze and his movements. In one scene, he gives in to an uncharasteristic, frenetic tribal dance. Then it vanishes from his character, like a deluge in the Sahara. He?s smart enough to figure out how to dupe women and live off them. He isn?t smart enough to know that his only way out is to marry one of them before he?s found out. His confusion lies in an impossible dream ? to marry a white woman and live off her in the West (even Cyprus is OK, he concedes to his middle-aged mistress, and he doesn?t mind someone mind 20-30 years old). His tragedy is that, while an attractive dark-skinned woman who?s well off offers him everything ? a visa to Dubai and a job, a home, love and marriage ? he rejects her for a white woman he?ll never find. People blinded and destroyed by their utopias while the reality they reject offers survival, even a shot at happiness, are all around us. It can happen to the most intelligent of people. The director has succeeded here in taking a very ordinary type and making an utterly believable, and tragic, figure out of that. That?s a very intelligent piece of script writing and direction.? ?
He?s a new type of anti-hero in Sri Lankan cinema. Examples of precedents can be found in Handagama?s films, or in Dharmasiri Bandaranaike?s ?Thunveni Yamaya,? or even from the 60s or 70s commercial cinema. But such anti-heroes ? Gamini Fonseka, Senadheera Rupasinghe or Wally Nanayakkara were dashing crooks and conmen. They were also more ethical and morally upright. They were loyal to their friends and faithful lovers and husbands to their wives. They were in fact heroes.?
?
But Sasitha isn?t a dashing screen figure. He?s neither handsome nor ugly, neither tall nor short, and has absolutely no charm. He?s physically a coward. He talks of serious crime (robbing a bank) but opts for the ?softer? crime of conning women. In the one scene where he?s threatened with physical violence, he backs out. He?ll never be a hero.? ?
But he?s a smooth talker when it suits his purpose, and succeeds in getting money as well as sex from all his partners, an astounding rate of success. But this is not a profound study of what makes such people so good at conning women (they appear regularly in the news, having wed or bedded anything from four to forty partners while ripping them off. Instead, it?s an amusing, but ultimately tragic, study of one such character?s self-destructive path. It isn?t a study of inner psychology but of outer mechanisms, and it works because here is a character straight off the street or office of anyone?s experience ? everyone knows someone who looks and talks like Sasitha. He could be a technician, driver, lawyer or company executive. He?s everyman. As an anti-hero, he?s more fully rounded than any other Sri Lankan cinematic character one can think of, and it?s a bold, mature director who can cast such a type in the main role of his debut feature.? ?
Why do women find him so attractive? The film doesn?t try to explain that. Another problem with this film is that all the characters are without any redeeming quality (a factor mentioned earlier when reviewing ?Motor bicycle?), unless we take the character of Damitha Hemachandra and think of her love for Sasitha as a redeeming quality. His nameless friend in the film (Rajitha Hewathanthirige) is having an affair with his friend?s sister behind his back. Sasitha?s employer is a former leftist who?s exploiting the only employee he has. Sasitha?s girl friend (Sulochana Withanachchi) becomes the employer?s mistress after dumping him. The present generation of film makers, one can conclude, have a very harsh view of the world. It?s their privilege. Pathiraja?s characters didn?t live in paradise but there?s a charm about them totally lacking in contemporary cinema.? ?
The acting is excellent. Sasitha?s victims are played by Veena Jayakody, Damitha Hemachandra, Sulochana Withanachchi and Geetha Alahakoon. Prasadini Atapattu plays the role of Sasitha?s friend?s ex-wife. Chintaka Somakirthi?s cinematography is dark and moody, and the superb opening sequence hints at the mentally unstable and predatory nature of the main character. Chithral Somapala?s score is unobtrusive, leaving the drama to unravel without propping it up.? ?
Credit is due to this young film maker for making an intelligent movie that is (intentionally or not) very funny at times. The challenge now is to find an intelligent audience. Tharangani cinema was packed and most of the crowd could not get in. But distributors live in mortal fear that these ?festival films? will not bring in a return. This film was made five years ago, but still hasn?t found a distributor. The distribution system is chronically ill and the film corporation cuts a pathetic figure in this context.? ?
There is too, a lengthy kissing scene in the film (perhaps the longest kiss in Sri Lankan cinema, and there have been very few to date) which the censors have failed to notice. Or they may not have seen it yet. Dinosaurs can?t be made to dance the tango, but they can at least look the other way when those who can, try it.? ? ?

## Title: Case of the  Phantom Limb

Case of the  Phantom Limb
	
Today, in our mission to take our reader through the obscure pathways in medicine, which lead to quite fascinating destinations, but remain mostly unexplored by the layman, we are exploring the subject of ?Phantom Limb?.? ?
Amputation of a limb or a part of a limb is done due to various causes in medicine. Irreparable trauma and severe infection resulting in death of the limb or part of a limb are some such reasons for performing amputations. Even though it?s usually devastating for the patient, surgery is done in order to prevent infection or toxic substances from the affected part from spreading further and to retain maximum possible function in the limb through reconstruction.?
?
Even though the limb is not there, the nerves that are leading from the limb to the brain and the part of brain representing that limb
?
Even after the limb is removed during the surgery, it is found that many patients retain the ?feelings? of that limb, called ?phantom limb sensations?. Try to imagine that you are missing a part of your leg and that you feel an uncontrollable itchy sensation in the big toe of that ?missing? limb, which in reality is just thin air. Some cases go as far as experiencing severe long term pain in the missing limb to an extent that it greatly hinders their day-to-day lives.? ?
Initially, this curious phenomenon was believed to be of psychological origin, meaning that the patient ?imagined? that the limb was still there and it was paining. But with the advancement of medicine; even though we are far from understanding completely the phenomenon of phantom limb, it has been discovered that it was the ?brain? and not the mind that has been fooled.? ?
Even though the limb is not there, the nerves that are leading from the limb to the brain and the part of brain representing that limb are still very much intact. There are various theories as to why the sensations are felt even when the limb is removed.
One suspected cause is increased sensitivity of the residual nerves to stimuli, causing pain while another, more interesting theory suggests that the areas of the brain representing the amputated part are ?rewired? due to lack of work to do, resulting in stimuli in other body parts, the lips for an the example, generating sensation in absent limb. This has been proved to be true by conducting nerve conduction studies. Another theory is the ?remembered pain hypotheses?, where it is believed that the pain in the limb that the patient experienced around the time of amputation makes a strong impression in the brain, which later manifests as phantom pain. This is also believed to have some basis due to the fact that the phantom pain phenomenon is more common in patients who had severe pain of the limb before amputations.? ?
?
?Some cases go as far as experiencing severe long term pain in the missing limb to an extent that it greatly hinders their day-to-day lives
Even more interestingly, some methods of treatment for phantom limb pain methods involve purposely tricking the brain too. In the treatment method called ?mirror box?, invented by Dr. V.C Ramachandran, a mirror is placed in front of the missing limb and the intact limb is placed in front of it so the brain is tricked into thinking that both limbs are intact. Relaxing the intact limb in front of the mirror has resulted in the tightening painful sensations in the phantom limbs to go away in many patients.? ?
Learning about the challenges brought forward by Mother Nature, and observing? innovative designs by humans in order to overcome those barriers can be quite intriguing, don?t you agree?? ?

First Capital?s ?A-? rating reaffirmed by ICRA Lanka
	
The issuer rating of SL[A-] with stable outlook was reaffirmed for First Capital Holdings PLC (First Capital) by ICRA Lanka Ltd, a subsidiary of ICRA Ltd, a group company of Moody?s Investors Service.
ICRA Lanka also reaffirmed the issuer rating [SL]A- with stable outlook for First Capital?s standalone primary dealer First Capital Treasuries PLC.
First Capital Holdings PLC is also the holding company for other entities in the financial services space, engaged in making investments and managing its subsidiaries, i.e. First Capital Treasuries PLC an authorised primary dealer in government securities, First Capital Limited involved in structuring and placement of corporate debt and corporate finance advisory services and investments, First Capital Asset Management Ltd. involved in unit trust and portfolio management; First Capital Markets Ltd involved in providing margin trading facilities and dealing and broking of listed debts, First Capital Trustee Services Ltd a trustee services provider for corporate debt securities and First Capital Equities Ltd engaged in stock broking activities.
However, First Capital Treasuries accounts for 70 percent of the consolidated assets and 80 percent of the consolidated net trading income of First Capital for FY2017. The ratings take note of First Capital?s efforts to expand the business and financial performances of the other subsidiaries, which are engaged in corporate debt structuring, corporate finance, asset management, stock broking, extending margin trading facilities and trustee services; however their scale of operations continues to remain moderate. First Capital?s borrowings are largely short term in nature and are used for investment and lending to group entities. The rating factors the First Capital group?s established relationships with banks and financial institutions, providing access to funding. Further, ICRA Lanka expects timely funding support from First Capital Treasuries, considering the liquid nature of its assets.
First Capital, being a holding company derives its income from the dividends from the group entities and income from its investments, which includes interest income and profit from investments. For the FY2017 stand-alone income from investment activities improved (Rs.774 million total income in FY2017 vis-a-vis Rs.336 million in FY2016), while the share of profit from subsidiaries increased steeply (Rs.194 million in FY2017 vis-a-vis Rs.14 million in FY2016).

Harmonizing name value with birth-date value
	
?
We have so far discussed the significance of the basic numbers from 1 to 9 and that of the general numbers from 10 to 72. Now let us learn how to employ our knowledge acquired so far to adjust the name value with the birth-date value.? If the name value and the birth-date value are in harmony, well and good.? If they are not, we have to modify the name value to have it in harmony with the birth-date value.? Because we can change the name suitably, but we cannot change the birth-date.?
?
Take the case of a person born on 06.06.1974. His name is Ravinath Balawardhana. Being born on the 6th his life-path number or destiny number is 6.?
?
?
The numerical value of his name should be as follows:
?
?
R = 2 A = 1 V = 6  I =? 1 N = 5
A = 1
T = 4
H = 5
? ? ?25
?
?
B = 2
A = 1
L = 3
A = 1 
W = 6
A = 1
R = 2
D = 4
H = 5
A = 1
N = 5
A = 1
? ? ?32
?
Grand total = 25+ 32 = 57
?
?
The numerical value that the name yields is 57.? According to the significance of this number we have already learnt in previous articles, the owner of the name is sociable and has pleasing manners.? He would achieve success in life due to persistent efforts and perseverance.
?
Here again the name value of 57 is good when it is reduced to the basic number we get 5 + 7 = 12 = 3 which is in harmony with the birth-date number.?
?
Next let us see whether the number of the name value vibrates in harmony with the destiny or the compound number.
?
The destiny number of the native should be 06.06.1974 =? ?6 + 6 + 1 + 9 + 7 + 4 = 3 + 3 = 6
In this case, we find that birth-date number destiny number and name value number are quite in harmony.?
?
Therefore, the native would enjoy the favourable results signified by the number 57 as quoted (in bold italic type) above.?
?
In the next article, let us discuss the case of? another person? whose name value? is not harmony with? the birth-date? to illustrate? how the name? has to be modified? to yield a? number which would produce favourable results.? ?
?

How to plan for a good night?s sleep
	
?Sleep is the golden chain which ties our health and bodies together?-Thomas Dekker, 1602
Sleep plays an essential part in our daily routine. After a long day we all crave to jump into bed and have a good sleep, so that work on the next day could be started off with a relaxed mind and body. In fact, most of us target this quality sleep during the night to obtain proper rest, but have you ever thought, what we do during the whole day? This is because what we do during the day has a big impact on the quality of our sleep.
?
In this article, we are going to discuss the importance of quality sleep in order to maintain a healthy lifestyle and offer a guideline on how to achieve the kind of sleep we want you to focus on. You will never regret on the few minutes allocated to read their article as you, yourself, would enjoy the relaxation you experience following a good sleep. However this is possible only after putting into practice these tips.? ?
?
According to the latest research, optimizing your sleep solely depends on three major things. They are Preparation (practicing good sleep habits), Environment (tweaking your surroundings for quality sleep) and timing (Ability to fall asleep when you feel, you need it).??
?
Let?s start off from the beginning of the day.??
?
Morning
?
Hitting the snooze button. Well, we advise you to put a full stop to this habit at least for some time in order to achieve a sound sleep. There is no doubt that most of us have this habit in general to hit the snooze button and adjust the alarm. Surprisingly this happens even without knowing because we have been doing it over a long period of time.??
?
However, it?s time to say bye to your incredibly loud and irritating alarm clock and try something new which would make waking up easier and natural i.e. music or comfortable sounds.??
?
Avoid drinking coffee immediately after waking up. According to the latest research, Caffeine shortens phases three and four of the sleep cycle where REM sleep and dreaming occur. Therefore, people have made it a habit to drink coffee or other caffeine containing beverages before sleep, fail in gaining the expected optimal sleep.??
?
Don?t ever skip breakfast. Your diet can actually override your circadian clock and can help you overcome jet lag, a wonky work schedule, or a few nights of inconsistent sleep??
?
Afternoon
?
Avoid a huge lunch, which will make you sleepy, and a nap that can disrupt your sleep cycle.??
?
Have less carbs for lunch. This is the key to a healthy body while giving your mind the opportunity to achieve the optimal sleep.??
?
Avoid afternoon naps (or limit it to 20 minutes) especially following a heavy lunch.??
?
Cut back on carbs and proteins in the late afternoon and evening as you prepare to sleep, or else you?ll signal to your body that you plan to be awake for a while.
??
Evening/Night
?
Avoid saturated fats especially at night. Studies have shown that foods containing saturated fat, such as red meat, pork, lamb, and most dairy products, disrupt circadian rhythms, hence eating them near bedtime may prevent you from falling asleep.??
?
Try to meditate before sleep. Try to visualize a dream you would love to have in reality or if you?ve woken up in the middle of the night, calm down, focus on sleeping and try to visualize where your dream left off.??
?
Go to bed at the same time every night. This habit is one of the major factors, contributing towards quality sleep.??
?
Keep a cool room. Temperature is a very important factor in helping your body as well as mind to relax during sleep.??
?
While Sleeping
?
Try a weighted blanket which would make your sleep more comfortably and cozily; of course not in sweaty, hot nights.??
?
Which side to sleep on. According to experts, sleeping on the left side is highly encouraged as it is known to relieve heartburn symptoms whereas it is also advised during pregnancy to improve blood circulation to the heart which favours mom and baby to maintain sound health.??
?
Sleeping with light clothes. It helps in brown fat metabolism and favours in maintaining skin to skin contact, which has a positive impact on psychological comfort.??
?
Try to follow this guideline from today itself so that you will become a person who experiences the benefits we have discussed firsthand.?

I will prove everything with sufficient facts: Ranjan
	
Deputy Minister Ranjan Ramanayake responding to a notice issued to him yesterday to appear before the Supreme Court on October 25 with regard to alleged contempt of court said he will prove in Courts the veracity of the statements he made on legal professionals.
The Deputy Minister is alleged to have made remarks in contempt of court after he said that certain members in the legal profession were corrupt.
Mr. Ramanayake told the Daily Mirror that he will go before the Supreme Courts and prove the veracity of the statements he made. ?I said what I said about the lawyers speaking on behalf of the ordinary people. What I talked about is the plight ordinary people have to undergo when they try to seek redress from courts through some lawyers. I did not refer to all of them but some,? he said.
He said he had already retained a team of honest lawyers including one MP who happens to be a lawyer.
Meanwhile, Mr Ramanayake proposed that all lawyers should be made legally bound to issue receipts for the fees they received from their clients.
?Many professionals such as doctors provide receipts for the payments they charge. Even private sector workers get a pay slip. Therefore lawyers too should be made to give receipts so that one gets an idea on the revenue they generate,? the Deputy Minister added. (Yohan Perera)

Ironing out doubts on Iron Deficiency
	
It?s very likely that you are familiar with the term ?Anaemia?. But did you know that approximately 41% of children who are of? pre-school age and 37% of non-pregnant females in the world, according to the WHO, are suffering from anaemia? Anaemia is a complex subject to discuss. But it?s important to have a basic understanding of the conditions related to the disease and the facts surrounding it, specially considering the high prevalence of anaemia. That is why ?Health Capsule? decided to consult Dr. K.A.C Wickramaratne, Consultant Haematologist and Senior Lecturer at the Faculty of Medicine, University of Ruhuna, Galle regarding? ?Iron Deficiency Anaemia?, the most common type of anaemias
It?s not a disease?
?Anaemia is not a disease, but a manifestation of a disease?, said Dr. Wickramaratne. Anaemia isn?t the disease itself, but it?s about how the disease presents to the outside. Similarly, if we have anaemia, that means there is an underlying cause for it and we need to find that out and treat the cause itself to find a permanent cure.??
In order to understand what anaemia is, first we need to understand that blood has different components. One of these components, Red Blood Cells (RBC) has a pigment called Haemoglobin (Hb), which aids in transportation of oxygen to the body tissues. The amount of Hb that is within a person?s body depends on age, sex and the physiological status of the individual. ?Newborn babies have the highest reading of Hb, which subsides within a few weeks after birth. Males usually have higher values than females and pregnant females usually have lower values,? explained the doctor. If a person has a hemoglobin value below the expected lower limit, he or she is said to have anaemia.??
The production of hemoglobin requires three main nutritional components: Iron, Vitamin B12 and Folic acid. If the production of Hb is low due to the deficiency of Iron, it?s called Iron Deficiency Anaemia (IDA).??
Disease Presentation
Anaemia in most cases presents itself with non specific symptoms, according to Dr. Wickramaratne. ?The reason is because this condition usually develops over a long time. Therefore, the body adapts to the lack of Hb, gradually making compensations,? he continued.??
Lethargy, weakness and being easily tired are the main symptoms of anaemia. The patient may complain that even though he climbed a flight of stairs easily a few months ago, now he gets exhausted after doing so. A person who was used to vigorous exercise may now find it impossible to carry on exercising beyond a few minutes. They may feel faintish when standing for long. The students may show low performance and lack concentration in school. Such people get scolded for being ?lazy?.??
One specific symptom for IDA is the condition called ?picca? where the patient gets the desire to eat non-food items like clay, chalk, pastel, charcoal and raw rice or dhal etc. Other symptoms like brittle nails, nail changes and loss of hair can be present. ? Few decades ago we got patients presenting with a difficulty to swallow, due to web formation in gullet caused by severe long standing anaemia?, he said adding that these type of cases are quite rare at present.? Hemoglobin in RBC is what keeps the blood red. This gives the pinkish colour to our sclera, tongue and lips. Therefore anaemic patients may present with pale skin, sclera and lips, according to the doctor.??
Whys and Hows?of IDA
The deficiency of iron can be due to three main causes, according to Dr.Wickramaratne.?
The first is due to the deficiency of iron in the diet. Even though Iron is a common compound in the earth?s crust, it?s usually in the Ferric (fe3+) form. But the body can only absorb iron when it is in Ferrous (fe2+) form. There are special mechanisms in the body, including gastric acidity, which converts ferric to ferrous form.??
?The absorption of Iron to the body is tightly regulated and it is said that only 1/10 th of the Iron that is contained in our food is absorbed into our body,? explained Dr. Wickramaratne.??
If the diet is ok and we are healthy, our bodies can have iron stores which can sustain us for about a year or more. Even though plant sources like green leaves have plenty of iron, they are usually not in absorbable form. ?Animal sources like fish and meat are the richest sources of iron since they are in absorbable form?, stated the doctor.??
The second cause of IDA is blood loss, which will lead to loss of iron along with it (as Hb). This may go unnoticed because blood loss doesn?t always have to be significant and visible. Small quantities of blood loss from conditions like reflux esophagitis, gastritis and haemorrhoids which continue for a long time, and cancer in bowels may result in a significant loss of iron over a period of time.??
The main cause for anaemia in females of child-bearing age is excessive blood loss from menstruation. This condition usually referred to as ?heavy periods? may be hereditary and may go untreated because they consider it ?normal? and ignore the condition for years. ?We have observed young girls of 16, 17 years presenting with severe anemia due to heavy menstruation,? said the doctor.??
Another cause for anaemia in females is frequent, multiple pregnancies. ?The foetus absorbs the iron that it needs from the body of the mother. Therefore if she goes through multiple pregnancies within a short period of time, without having a chance to replete the iron stores, she can face a deficiency of iron,? warned Dr. Wickramaratne.??
Another cause for iron deficiency, which is worm infestation in gut, specially hook worm, is not common and can be avoided with the availability of appropriate sanitation.??
The final cause, although not very common, is the failure to absorb iron into the body. People who have celiac diseases or have undergone procedures like gastric bypass surgery are at risk. In addition, even when the food contains iron, there may be sources in the food itself that inhibit iron absorption. Some inhibitors in vegetables itself like calcium and phytate are examples. Drinking coffee or tea soon after a meal affects iron absorption since tannin and caffeine contained in those beverages are also inhibitors of iron absorption.??
Gastric acidity is a crucial factor in the absorption of iron. Therefore people who are using over the counter drugs for gastric acidity for a long period of time are at risk of IDA. One reason for this is poor absorption and the untreated gastritis related concealed blood loss!??
Effects?
The usual effect is that due to the deficiency of Hb, the oxygen carrying capacity in blood is reduced. This results in reduced oxygen to the tissues including the brain. This causes an anaemic patient?s working capacity to drop.? ?
Anaemia when severe, can affect the heart as well, because to compensate for the lack of oxygen the heart has to work harder. This may cause the heart to enlarge or create the condition called heart failure, in extreme cases. Anaemia, if associated with patients having narrowed blood vessels in the heart due to cholesterol, may easily give rise to heart attacks, said the doctor.??
Anaemia in pregnancy will result in negative consequences for both the mother and the baby, including premature birth and restriction of the growth of the foetus resulting in low birth weight. And if there is sudden blood loss, they can easily go in to many ominous complications.??
Investigations and Treatment
The main investigation for anaemia is the Full Blood Count followed by an investigation called the Blood Picture, according to Dr. Wickramaratne. Studies of the body?s iron stores are also done using blood tests if the doctor deems them necessary.??
?Confirming anaemia doesn?t mean that you?ve identified the disease?, stressed the doctor. Identifying the cause of anaemia is crucial. A good history and examination with a detailed dietary history is essential and if the cause is not related to nutrition deficiency, various other tests need to be done to find the root cause. In addition to correcting the deficiency of iron, the cause also needs to be treated, regardless of whether it?s adjusting the diet, treating gastritis, or undergoing surgery for haemorroids.??
The treatment for IDA varies from patient to patient. ?A pregnant woman near her due date or a person who has heart problems may need immediate blood transfusions while most patients would be recommended oral iron therapy. Monitoring the patient following treatment to determine the effect of treatment is essential since given that the treatment is ineffective, another treatment option may be needed,?, said Dr. Wickramaratne.??
Self Medication for anaemia is strictly inadvisable according to the doctor, since the root cause of the anaemia isn?t identified through this method. ?In children, anemia may be a result of a more serious genetic condition like Thalassaemia, where the defect lies not in the deficiency of iron, but the production of RBC itself,? said the doctor. Similarly, in adults, anaemia may be the presentation of underlying cause of a condition like Chronic Kidney Disease or even bowel cancer. ?If the patient is taking over the counter iron or nutrient supplementation without knowing the cause of anaemia, we may miss out the chance of early diagnosis and treatment of the disease, which greatly decreases his chance of survival,? he cautioned.??
Prevention?before cure
Is it possible to prevent Iron Deficiency Anemia through modifying our diet? Spacing childbirth, appropriate treatment for long periods, good sanitation etc would help. ?In Sri Lanka we are used to cooking our vegetables and green leaves which destroys the vitamins that aids in absorbing iron into the body. Therefore adding a regular salad into your diet flavoured with lime juice (which favours iron absorption) is advisable. Having fresh fruits or fruit juice instead of having tea and coffee and taking calcium supplements directly after a meal is important. This is especially advised for people who are on a long term vegetarian diet,? concluded the doctor.? ? ?

Rajitha must be sent home: GMOA
	
While stating that the Government Medical Officers? Association (GMOA) had no intention of entering into politics as per the claims made by Minister Rajitha Senaratne, the GMOA yesterday said that ministers such as Rajitha Senaratne must be sent home.
GMOA Assistant Secretary Dr. Naveen de Soyza told a news conference that Minister Senaratne had recently claimed that a member of the GMOA had been included in the district nomination lists in all districts with the hope of returning 25 GMOA members as law makers in the next Parliament.
Rejecting these claims, Dr.Soyza said that the GMOA was keen on following their policies even though Minister Senaratne does not have any. ?There is no need for doctors to engage in politics or enter Parliament, but the necessity here is to keep away politicians such as Minister Senaratne from politics. Such ministers should be sent home,? he added.
Referring to the claims made by Minister Senaratne that the students attached to state medical faculties had attended to lectures by going against the stance of the GMOA, Dr. Soyza said that the actions of the students were taken in accordance with the decision of their student unions.
He said that the GMOA was just making the students aware of the ongoing procedure on the of SAITM issue and added that the association was not involved in any kind of decision making process of the university students. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)

SLFP MP Mahindananda Aluthgamage, who was sacked from his post of party organiser for Nawalapitiya, said today they would set up a broad alliance against the government and pointed out that even the JVP could join them.
He said they would focus on defeating the yahapalanaya government by contesting the upcoming local government elections from this alliance.
?We have still not decided about the name and the symbol of the new alliance but we will definitively form one. We will contest the upcoming elections from this alliance which will be backed by the joint opposition. We invite all parties and groups including the JVP to join us and defeat this government,? he told Daily Mirror.
The MP said seven SLFP organisers, who were senior politicians with a large voter base, were removed by the party leadership for not joining the UNP-SLFP ?yahapalana? government and highlighted the fact that the SLFP was not given a mandate to form a government with the UNP.
?We are the ones who follow the real SLFP policies and values today. I have been replaced with a former UNP activist for Nawalapitiya. The SLFP has no future anymore,? he said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

SL better in hunger index ranking
	
With a score of 25.5, Sri Lanka has been ranked 84th among 119 countries in the 2017 Global Hunger Index (GHI) under the ?serious? category.
The index which was compiled by the Washington-based International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) was released on Wednesday.
India is ranked 100th, Pakistan 106th and Bangladesh 88th while Nepal is ranked 72nd and Afghanistan ranked 107th.
The index was compiled based on the four indicators -- Undernourishment, Child wasting, Child stunting and Child mortality.
Child wasting has been described as the share of children under the age of five who are wasted; that is, who have low weight for their height, reflecting acute under-nutrition.
?Apart from India, only three other countries -- Sri Lanka, Djibouti and South Sudan have data or estimates showing child wasting of more than 20 per cent during the period under review. Wasting is most prevalent in Sri Lanka, Djibouti and South Sudan where 21.4 to 27.3 per cent of children under five years of age are affected,? it said.
Fourteen countries including Belarus, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Chile, Kuwait and Turkey made to the top of the list collectively with an score less than five each.
Central African Republic scored the highest marks and ranked at the bottom of the index followed by Chad, Sierra Leone, Madagascar and Zambia respectively.
The index report said GHI scores are not calculated for some high-income countries where the prevalence of hunger is very low.

SLPP slated to win over 200 PSs - Basil
	
Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) front liner Basil Rajapaksa said yesterday they would contest the upcoming Local Government election as a broad alliance with other political parties and would secure more than 200 Pradeshiya Sabhas.
He told a news conference that there were around 170 Pradeshiya Sabhas in the electorates they had won during the last Presidential and General elections and added that it could be increased up to 200 at the next LG polls.
He said several political parties had agreed to contest the upcoming election as an alliance with the Podujana Peramuna and added that final decision had not been taken on the matter as yet.
?We would align with the parties in the joint opposition and several other parties. We have also discussed with Northern Tamil parties which are against Tamil National Alliance (TNA). We have not decided whether to contest under a common symbol or as a front just as how the UNP contested at the last general election or under different symbols,? he said.
He said however, they had agreed on several key matters including those of contesting the election campaign on a common manifesto and under the leadership of former president Mahinda Rajapaksa.
Mr. Rajapaksa said they would launch their election campaign considering it as a referendum against the government on its anti-democratic actions, economic crisis, mounting cost of living, selling of state resources, crippling of village level development, non-generation of employments and matters related to the Constitution.
He said they appreciated the government?s move to increase women representation at the LG polls and added that they would field more youth for the election whereas the government acted to decrease the quota for the youth.
He said more than 500 contestants of the SLPP had deprived of their rights to contest the LG polls due to the amendment brought by the government preventing field officers contesting the election.
When asked about the Constitution, he said they completely rejected the proposed Constitution and added that it was clear that it was being done with an ulterior motive.
?This Constitution may lead to disharmony, division of the country and economic debacle,? he said. (Ajith Siriwardana)

The report further revealed that the babies had been purchased for about $30 and was sold abroad for about 30 times that value. However neither the Sri Lankan Government nor the receiving Governments have taken? any worthwhile steps to address? the issue, until recently when Health Minister, Dr. Rajitha Senaratne? admitted to the revelations of the documentary makers that? there had been baby farms and that he will investigate into the issue and take the initiative to set up a DNA bank.?
It is claimed that around 11 000 babies had been sold during this period. Children had been stolen from the arms of their biological mothers. One woman, who requested anonymity, said that her child was stolen at the Ratnapura Hospital. ?This was during the JVP insurrection. The hospital didn?t give me my child. There was no one to inquire from because the doctors were on strike. The baby was stolen,? she said.
? ?In certain instances fake mothers have handed over the child and now the adopted children have the information of this mother who is acting as their biological mother. In certain other instances the birth mothers had been deceived or coerced into giving the babies for adoption. There is also concern that women have been raped for the adoption market. Further, sources told?Dailymirror that during the time referred to in the documentary the practice of tourists walking into the hospital and picking babies for adoption had existed.
Most mothers have given their children for adoption due to lack of support in raising the children on their won. Gallaguruge Sirimawathie said that she had to give her child for adoption because she was helpless. ?My husband and his family were abusive. I had nowhere to go and I had to give the child up for adoption,? said a weeping Sirimawathie. ?I don?t want anything from the child. I only want to see the child before I die,? she grieved.? ?
Further, though agents from adoption agencies, help children locate their mothers and vice versa, mothers and adopted children told us that they weren?t trustworthy and were money-minded. Sirimawathie has traced her child through the birth certificate and knows that the child lives in Sweden. However, the agent who had located the whereabouts of the child had refused to provide her with further information claiming that the child didn?t want to meet the mother. Sirimawathie is suspicious of the agent?s trustworthiness.? ?
Another woman, W.P. Leelawathie from Homagamasaid that when she gave up her son for adoption the agent promised her that the son would return to her one day. But she has received no news of him to date.? ?
Renuka Abeysinghe from Matugama, who had given her daughter for adoption voluntarily, said that she only wanted to see the child, but added that she has no information about her whereabouts. ?I was given a letter thanking me and the letter also said that I will receive photographs. But I have received nothing. The child must be big now. I only want to see her,? she pleaded.? ?
The documents that were prepared, such as the birth certificate, contain erroneous details which are misleading. A 40-year-old adoptee, who is currently living in Belgium and didn?t wish to be named, said that his family name, mother?s name and the birth date were false in the adoption papers and in the hospital register. However he has succeeded in locating his biological mother from Wellawatte.? ?
When asked about the difficulties he had to endure as a result of the irregularities in his adoption he said that when he wanted to marry he didn?t have a birth certificate, but only adoption papers. He added that these papers were inadequate when dealing with the local Government. ?Basically, I had to prove that I existed. After living here, attending school, playing sports, and becoming a world champion, I wasn?t allowed to marry because I didn?t have the necessary documents,? he said.
Shirani van den Berg, living in the Netherlands, said that her adoptive mother was unstable, alcoholic and often made her feel unwanted. ?A mother has the right to know where the child is living and the child has the right to know its biological mother and its medical history,? she asserted.? ?In the light of the recent revelations the?Dailymirror spoke to some concerned parties.
?Women were raped for the adoption market?
The filmmaker of the Dutch documentary made by Zembla, Sanne Van Rossen is Sri Lankan born and was adopted by Dutch parents.? ?

?There were a lot of false things in the papers regarding the adopted children. For instance, when they did the DNA Test the mother they traced through their papers weren?t really the biological mothers. Sometimes the birth place would be wrong. That is why I did the research,? the 32-year-old told?Dailymirror in a skype interview? ?
Women had been picked up from the street and had been raped to produce children for the adoption market. Some women had been paid while some weren?t. ?The story that revolved around these adoptions suggests that adoption was illegal. You can consider it to be legal because of the papers which had been documented by lawyers or very powerful people. These were court adoptions. But these adoptions are illegal because women were raped for the adoption market. They had to give their babies away either because they were forced or they were made to believe the children would return later with money,? she said.?
?
?I have documented an incident involving the Flash adoption organization where the mother refuses to give the baby away. Instead they gave her money and asked her to shut up,? she said referring to the documentary she had made. In another incident involving a twin brother and sister, one baby had died, but the corpse was replaced by another, so that they appeared to be twins,? she said.?

?Flash, was an adoption agency back in the 80s and the 90s. They were selling babies. Flash would arrange a baby in 3 or 4 months. There were around 4 or 5 such adoption organizations with the history. They did the same thing,? she said. According to her the cost of an adoption was as much as ?15 000 at that time. Flash no longer exists.? ?
?Everyone is saying that he or she didn?t know or that it is not his or her fault,? she said.? ?
Now that these adopted children are in search of their mothers the people who were previously involved in the adoption market have offered root searching which again seems to have become a lucrative business. ?We do root searching through people from Sri Lanka who were involved with Flash back in the 80s. We need to pay a lot of money and it?s not trustworthy. It?s better to go by yourself and search for yourself. Sometimes these contact persons say I have found your mother, but they don?t provide the address,? she said.? ?
She started her own search for her biological mother in 2010. Her birth certificate states that she had been born at the Rathnapura Hospital. Accordingly she traced her birth mother and a DNA Test proved the biological connection. However her mother had given birth to her at the Karawanella Hospital.? ?
?Children were turned into commodities?
The Executive Director of ?Against Child Trafficking?(ACT), Arun Dhole, said that though this scandal was reported in the media in the 1980s neither the Government in Sri Lanka nor the Governments in the receiving countries had addressed it. ACT is a child rights NGO established in 2008 at the suggestion of the European Commission.? ?
According to Dhole, children were ?manufactured? not just in Sri Lanka, but also in South and Middle America, India, Nepal, Thailand, Romania etc.??
-Arun Dohle?Executive Director of Against Child Trafficking (ACT)?
?There?s a demand for children, so supply is created. In a market- even when regulated- its forces are stronger than the interest of the children and their families,? he explained.? ?
?The problem regarding these adoptions is that some children appear to be bought, the paperwork is fabricated and there is no information about consent being given etc.Essentially children were turned into commodities,? he added.? ?He suggested that the Government of Sri Lanka should open a full-fledged investigation into the adoption practices from the past. ?The biological families as well as the adult adoptees need assistance in tracing each other and there should be compensation. For today?s children, Sri Lanka should just stop Inter-country Adoption and strengthen the implementation of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child,? he said.? ?
Article 21(b) of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child states that ?inter-country adoption may be considered as an alternative means of child?s care, if the child can?t be placed in a foster or an adoptive family or cannot in any suitable manner be cared for in the child?s country of origin. ?Nobody can tell me, that Sri Lanka or India can?t take care of its children,? he said.?
The problem regarding these adoptions is that some children appear to be bought, the paperwork is fabricated and there is no information about consent being given etc
?
Dhole was born in India and was adopted by German parents in 1973.? ?
?The biological mothers from Sri Lanka do not have the financial means to participate in the DNA bank?
When asked about the progress to set up a DNA database, so that the DNA of the biological parents, relatives and the adoptees could be stored to trace one another, one of the pioneers of the ?Sri Lanka Family Project?, Rowan Van Veelen, said that though most European adoptees were rich enough to participate in the process, the biological parents didn?t have the finances to do the DNA test on their own.? ?
-Rowan Van Veelen?

?They don?t have the financial means to participate in this DNA bank. This makes locating family members nearly impossible,? he said.? ?
?If the biological family from Sri Lanka can?t join this DNA bank, we are left with the only option of locating brothers and sisters in the west,? he added.? ?
Therefore the main goal of the ?Sri Lanka Family Project? is to get the DNA of the biological parents, so that they don?t incur expenses.? ?
?Through our organization we focus on bringing families together. It?s important to remember that it is not only the adopted children who have the urge to locate their biological families, the same goes for the families back in Sri Lanka who gave up their children for adoption either willingly or after being forced. When the database is created it will no longer be a hassle to know whether there was fraud in connection with our papers, because the DNA Test will provide proof of family ties,? he explained.? ?

?The adoption system is based on making a financial profit per baby. For me, as an adoptee, the worst thing about being adopted through this system is that when I was most vulnerable and dependent no one involved seemed to care about me and my well-being. The adoption agencies from western countries treated me as a profitable thing, instead as a person. So many terrible human rights violations were made and are still being made,? he claimed.? ?
?People would come, buy and go. She used to take money from these people.?
Consultant Pediatrician, former Chairman of the National Child Protection Authority (NCPA) and the Presidential Task Force on Child Protection, Prof. Harendra De Silva said that when he was an intern medical officer back in 1975 the paediatric ward was more ?like a supermarket for tourists?.
-Prof. Harendra De Silva?

?They came in couples, walked across and somebody would be showing the kids. Then the couple would say I want this one. This was the practice at that time,? he reminisced.? ?
He recalled an incident where a baby, who was just a few days old, who had been abandoned in a train, was brought to the Lady Ridgeway Hospital by a policeman. Later he (The policeman) was coerced by the Director of the hospital to handover the baby to a European couple, which he had refused to do. ?A European couple visited the ward. We weren?t even bothered about going behind them because it was routine for people to come and take children. This couple wanted the baby. I refused to handover the baby. The Director of the Hospital insisted that the child be handed over to the couple though I didn?t have any document,? he said. The Director had threatened to penalize him for disobeying orders of a superior.? ?

An Australian woman had been managing a house in Pamankada which was full of children at the time. Prof. De Silva had volunteered to examine the children. Today, looking back, he realizes that this place would have been a baby farm. ?People would come, buy and go. She used to take money from these people. There were lots of young Australian boy volunteers who were in their twenties or late teens who had come to work in this place. There were also orphaned girls who fell into the age rage between16-18. I realized that there was something odd going on. Then I decided not to visit the place. This would have been a baby farm,? he said.? ?
?They have coerced the mothers to handover their children saying that children will be brought up in a better place?
Andrew Silva is a tour guide who drives tourists around in his van. In year 2000 he was asked by a Dutch family to look for the biological parents of their adopted child. The search had been successful and gradually Silva was asked by several other adoptees to look for their parents. He is 60 years old and hasn?t been involved in the adoption fraud. He helps children and mothers locate each other as a social service. So far he has been able to reunite about 40 children with their mothers. Around 125 mothers, in search of their children, have approached Silva. When the? met him in Negombo he explained the adoption fraud in detail referring to information he possessed of biological mothers and the adopted children.? ?Holding out a birth certificate Silva said that though the certificate claimed that the baby had been born in Kalutara, the mother had said that the baby was born in the Karawanella Hospital in the Sabaragamuwa Province.?
-Andrew Silva?Volunteer Root Searcher
?There have been brokers at the Karawanella Hospital. They have coerced the mothers to handover the children saying that the children will be brought up in a better place with luxuries.? He further said that a broker at the Karawanella Hospital had offered mothers Rs.1000 to handover their children.? ?
In another case the birth certificate had been prepared claiming that the baby was born at the Kalubowila Hospital. But this information isn?t mentioned in the registers at the Kalubowila Hospital.? ?
?In some birth certificates the name would be correct, but not the hospital. If there are three names one would be correct. Or the father?s name would be incorrect,? he explained. ?Some mother?s don?t know where the child had been taken to nor the child?s name,?he said.?
In some birth certificates the name would be correct, but not the hospital. If there are three names one would be correct
In another instance a woman was traced to be the mother of twins who had been given away for adoption. However the mother claimed she had given birth to only one child. Accordingly a DNA Test was done and the results proved that the two children weren?t twins. Further, it was found that the woman wasn?t the mother of either of the children.? ?
Another girl, who was searching for her biological parents, contacted the adoption agency which had directed her to a person who was presented to her as the biological mother. However after few years this woman couldn?t be located. Then Silva had been asked to make inquiries. He got an article published with the name of the biological mother. Then the real biological mother had contacted him. Later a DNA Test was done and the results had been conclusive.? ?
Similarly in another case, a woman claimed to be the mother of the child, but when requested to undergo the DNA Test had admitted that she wasn?t the mother. Another child had been deceived for 6 years and made to believe that the fake mother was the actual mother. In another case the intermediary connected with an adoption organization has promised to handover money to the biological mother. The adopted child had asked Silva to make the inquiries independently and after a series of events the woman who had been presented had admitted to Silva that she wasn?t the mother and that she had been asked to act as the mother by the intermediary.? ?
Silva stressed that the Ratnapura Hospital was a hub where adoption fraud took place.? ?
In 2007 a child was kidnapped, by the midwife, and taken in a paper bag, from the Godakawala Hospital in Ratnapura. ?She was nabbed, but the mother saved herself from prosecution saying that she had given her consent,?he said.?

?Adopted children have a right to know about their biological parents?
M.A.M Hakeem, Senior Lecturer at the Department of Public and International Law, Faculty of Law, Colombo said that once the child is adopted there is no relationship between the biological parent and the child.
-M.A.M Hakeem?Legal expert
?So the birth certificate is amended. If a proper procedure is adopted then the consent of parents is present. They know to whom they have given their children. So they know where the children are,?said Hakeem.?
Referring to baby farms he said if women had been abducted, raped or their children were stolen, then it is a criminal act and criminal prosecution should take place. ?In such situations the biological mother has a right to know because she had been kept in the dark and doesn?t know what happened to her child,? he said.? ?
The Ministry of Justice can advise the Attorney General to take necessary steps to prosecute and expose who were the culprits behind these baby farms
He added that the Ministry of Women and Child Affairs, the Ministry of Health, the Ministry of Justice and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs can get together to investigate into such issues.
??The Ministry of Justice can advise the Attorney General to take necessary steps to prosecute and expose who were the culprits behind these baby farms,? he said.?
Under Section 360c of the Penal Code Amendment of 1995, buying, selling, bartering people for money or any other consideration is considered trafficking and is punishable.?
?If there are no local parents willing to adopt the child, the request is referred to a foreign adoption?
Probation and Child Care Services Commissioner? Chandima Sigera said that if an adopted child was searching for the biological parents the department would assist. However, if the biological parents sought assistance the Department wouldn?t assist because the child had been given away voluntarily.
-Chandima Sigera?Commissioner of the Department of Probation and Child Care Services
She pointed out that it was only after 1992, when the Adoption Ordinance was amended, that a proper procedure was introduced. However she added that during adoptions, prior to 1993, there could be instances where the birth certificate contained erroneous details. ?The department can?t take the responsibility for the authenticity of the information in birth certificates. If the children have birth certificates with wrong details we can?t trace the parents,? she said.? ?
?There can?t be such errors today because the adoption takes place following proper legal proceedings. We obtain the information through the provincial probation commissioners. We take children from children?s homes for adoption,?she said.?
Under the 13th Amendment, the children?s homes come under the purview of the Provincial Probations Commissions. ?When a request to give a child for adoption comes from a home, it is placed before several placement committees, so that local couples can adopt the child. If there are no local parents willing to adopt the child, the request is referred to foreign adoptions. If there are local parents then there won?t be a foreign adoption?.?

## Title: Surpassing coronary  complications  with  bypass  surgeries

Surpassing coronary  complications  with  bypass  surgeries
	
heart Health
With the ascending number of patients suffering from coronary complications, the need for bypass surgeries has also increased. Though heart surgeries are complicated and serious, if it is done by skilled medical professionals counting years of practice, coronary surgeries aren?t causes for worry. Cardiothoracic?
surgeon Dr. Namal Gamage and Dr. Jagath Alexander, consultant anaesthetist of the Karapitiya Teaching Hospital, possess reliable pairs of hands when it comes to bypass surgeries. They perform around 70 surgeries for a month. As expert surgeons they addressed the formalities of a bypass surgery to help the public understand that a bypass surgery isn?t as scary as it may sound.??
?
Anaesthesia? ?
Anaesthesia and surgery are two things that go hand in hand. Dr. Alexander explained that anaesthetics render a patient unconscious prior to a surgery.?
?
Anaesthetic Procedure? ?
Anaesthesia is the temporary induction of sensation loss and awareness. According to Dr. Alexander, there are 2 types of anaesthesia. They are general anaesthesia and local anaesthesia. ?In local anaesthesia, the patient is conscious and they are mildly sedated. In general anaesthesia, the patient is made unconscious,? he said.? ?
?Bypass is done under general anaesthesia. Anaesthetic dosages vary from patient to patient. The dosages depend on their health conditions and age,? explained Dr. Alexander.
?Patients in need of a bypass, generally suffer from non-communicable diseases such as diabetes and high blood pressure. These complications are taken into consideration when administering anaesthesia.The age of a patient is also an important factor when determining the anaesthetic dose. A person of 40 years faces anaesthetic conditions different to the conditions faced by a patient of 72 years. ?The doses and methods vary. We check the patients psychologically and physically and give a large consideration to pre operation and post operation care,? he added further.?
?Basics of a bypass? ?
A bypass is a surgery where damaged or blocked arteries of the heart are replaced using blood vessels from another part of your body.? ?
?When a bypass is done normally 2 things can be considered. One is the heart is stopped and the function of the heart is given to a machine. A bypass graft is performed on the coronary artery, where the bloodvessel is shunted beyond the block,? explained Dr.Alexander. After the patient is sedated and made unconscious, artificial ventilation is used on the patient. Then the bypass surgery is performed.? ?
Are you at risk?? 
?Patients with heart problems such as artherosclerosis are the ones who undergo a bypass surgery. Dr. Alexander stated coronary issues may be denoted by symptoms such as chest pain, being short of breath, pain in arm, neck, jaw.?
?Patients are required to seek medical attention from a cardiologist. He investigates the patient?s symptoms and diagnoses the condition. If the condition calls for a bypass surgery, the patient is directed to us,?said Dr. Alexander.
Is surgery necessary??
?
Neglecting chest pains and coronary problems can be fatal. These complications can lead to severe heart attacks.?
??Rise in no. of heart?patients
? ?There has been a substantial increase in the need for bypass surgeries in Sri Lanka. According to Dr. Alexander, this is mainly due to negative behavioural and lifestyle patterns. ?Food habits have become a major problem. People consume more and more junk food. They are also mentally not stable at present. Their moods are influenced by stress. Even the younger generation and people below 40 years of age are prone to the needs of bypass surgeries. Smoking and lack of exercises are other major factors that contribute to heart disease,? he opined.? ?
Pre-surgery preparations??
Before a bypass surgery is performed, the patient is looked after with great care. ?The confidence of the patient should be built before surgery. That is done by the doctor talking to the patient about the surgery before hand and making him ready step by step. If the patient is a smoker, we talk to him about quitting the habit after the surgery,? stressed the doctor.?
The second factor that is looked into before a bypass surgery is the health condition of the patient. The patient?s blood pressure and blood sugar are monitored closely to assure that the conditions are sustained under normal conditions. ?The most important thing that is considered before a surgery is whether the patient is suffering from chest infections and coughs.? he said. Dr. Alexander explained the reason for this. ?If the chest infection remains at a dormant stage, it could aggravate after the surgery. This could be just as harmful as AIDS due to the immune system of patients dropping after a surgery,? he explained. So the health conditions are considered for 3-4 weeks to ensure stability. Medicines and drugs are stopped 10 days before surgery.? ?
?
Post-surgery care? ?
The care given to a patient after a surgery is also quite important. ?First of all, if the patient is a smoker the patient has to stop smoking. The patient should be careful to maintain weight, so instructions regarding exercise are given to the patient. They should continue the intake of the prescribed medicine on time,? affirmed Dr. Alexander. He also mentioned that until after one month of operation, the patient should not meet up with visitors as they can carry germs and infections, transmitting disease to the patient. This could be dangerous as the patient?s immune system drops after surgery. Meeting visitors can be especially exhausting on the patient.? ?
Bypass Success Rate? ?
Bypass is of course quite common in the current population. Disease vulnerability has increased among people. ?Bypass surgeries are a matter of life and death. But the failure rate of a bypass is less as 1%. So bypass is very successful. A bypass patient?s lifetime can be prolonged by as long as 10 years, if he or she adheres to the tips given by the doctor,? stated Dr. Alexander.? ?

## Title: The disease that plagues your gums
## Section: Medicine

The disease that plagues your gums
	
Dental Care
Dental hygiene is one of the most important factors that should be maintained when it comes to personal health. There are a variety of illnesses and diseases that can cause discomfort and lower the quality of life which originate due to bad dental hygiene. One of these problems is gingivitis. Gingivitis is the inflammation of the gum or the gingiva, which gets inflamed due to certain bacteria. Speaking to? ?Health Capsule? Dr. Vipula Wickramasinghe, General Secretary of the Sri Lanka Dental Association and Regional Dental Surgeon of the Colombo District elaborated on the causes and symptoms of gingivitis and the specified treatment.??
?
Causes
Dr. Wickramasinghe stated that there are a variety of causes for gingivitis, the main one being plaque, ?Plaque is the food debris which are deposited in the gingival crevice, which is a tiny pocket in between the tooth and the gingiva. The food debris accumulates in this crevice and the bacteria acts on this and produces a substance called plaque. Its technical name is biofilm. Biofilm consists of bacteria, food debris and saliva. When the plaque accumulates in the gingival crevice because of the bacteria present in the plaque the gingiva gets inflamed,?the doctor said.?
Risk factors
Speaking of the contributory factors he said, ?Firstly if the person is a diabetic patient he or she is more prone to get gingivitis compared to a non-diabetic person, because the inflammation is so severe or frequent. Secondly, there are certain drugs which cause swelling of the gingiva. For example there are certain drugs that are used for high blood pressure or epilepsy. The side effect from these drugs causes the swollen gingiva. The swollen gingiva isn?t as hard as the normal one. It is very soft thus making it more prone to infection. Thirdly, people who are immune compromised- the people who have a defective immunization within the body are more prone to infections and because of that they get gingivitis more than the normal healthy person. Examples for such people are patients having HIV/AIDS or people who are on anti cancerous drugs or people who are on steroids. People who don?t brush their teeth properly, because brushing reduces the plaque. For example the disabled or differently abled people or people with psychiatric disorders. Fourthly, people who are not concerned with their hygiene,?Dr. Wickramasinghe said.?
?Another contributory factor is if you are a single side chewer. What occurs is, on the other side there is a tendency of accumulation of plaque, because when you are eating the saliva comes into the mouth and self cleanses the mouth. If you aren?t biting on both sides then the salivary glands on the non-biting side won?t activate as much, thus there will be less saliva on that side. Thus, plaque accumulates and there will be gingivitis on that particular side. Finally, during old age, due to lack of nutrition and certain other conditions, you get the recession of the gums and maybe infection of the gums as well,? he continued.??
Symptoms
Dr. Wickramasinghe stated that to identify the symptoms you must first compare it to a normal gum. Identifying the features of an uninfected gum he said, ?In the normal gum you get a pink colour gingiva, very well attached to the tooth surface and there is no discolouration in the gum margin and you can have a clear demarcation of the tooth because the tooth is white and the gum is pink.??
Moving on to the symptoms he said, ?But when gingivitis occurs the gum gets red in colour. It will be a little swollen and there will be bleeding during brushing. There will be spontaneous bleeding as in bleeding without a cause. You can have a bad odour from the mouth. You can see the discolouration or the accumulation of plaque along the gum margin and you can feel the harder stuff on top of that because the plaque absorbs the calcium of the saliva and it gets hardened, which is called calculus or tartar,?he further explained.?
Treatment
Dr. Wickramasinghe stated that treatment is divided into 2 parts. One is physical treatment and the other is therapeutic treatment. ?I will explain the Physical type of treatments. If you see the symptoms which I mentioned you have to go to a dental surgeon. Then he will advise you on how to brush. The patient has to understand the reason for the gingivitis and how to get rid of it. We give oral health education/ oral hygiene instruction. That includes the correct method of brushing, the use of a correct brush, use of the correct toothpaste, the correct brushing methods and how frequently you have to brush. Then the patient has to adhere to these instructions and simply by doing so you can reverse the gingivitis, if it is in the initial stage.?
If it isn?t in the initial stage, after following the oral hygiene instructions for at least one to two weeks, the patient may have to undergo a full mouth cleaning. And after that he/she has to follow instructions given by the doctor,?said Dr. Wickremesinghe.?
?The therapeutic type of treatment is that there are certain drugs and mouthwashes that are definitely and mandatorily have to be prescribed by the doctor. But the key message is that the therapeutic measures alone won?t help you to get rid of gingivitis. You must have the practice of using the physical mode of treatment as well. And most importantly the doctor has to review the patient to see whether it will recur,? he continued.?
?
He further said, ?If you don?t treat it, sometimes it will subside automatically. But Sometimes it will trigger what is called periodontitis which is an extension of gingivitis that involves not only in the gum, but in the periodontal ligaments which connects the tooth and the bones together and the bone itself. Which is why it is better to treat it in the initial stages,?he said.?
Prevention
Speaking on how to prevent gingivitis Dr. Wickramasinghe said, ?You have to brush twice a day, daily, mandatorily after dinner. Practice the correct brushing method . If you see any point of bleeding go to a doctor immediately for instructions, with practice only you can reverse the disease. And you have to maintain good oral hygiene with good health.???

The ?exoticisation? of culture
	
Someone once noted not too long ago that modernity was the West?s way of measuring itself against the Other, the rest of the world. It was a way of assessing progress, for the most material, which is why the transition in the 17th and 18th centuries from the Inquisition to the Reformation and then to the Enlightenment is so significant.?
Sir William Gregory?
The truth is that the West, particularly continental Europe, saw a fading away of its (for the most) theological systems of thought in favour of a rational, economistic conception of the relationship between the individual and the world. Whatever the critics might say, this was founded on a Judeo-Christian tradition (as Nalin de Silva has noted, its system of logic and rationality were no less different to science and Marxism), and it would not have blossomed into the Industrial Revolution without the Inquisition or the Reformation, the latter of which, particularly through Calvin and Luther, substituted collective salvation for individual repentance.??
Gandhi once offered an amusing riposte to someone who asked him as to what he thought of Western civilization: ?I think it would be a good idea.? Hidden beneath the amusement and the wit was a blunt, if not brash, comment on the dichotomy between the real and the ideal at the heart of that civilisation. Those who have read Fernand Braudel will no doubt believe that all civilisations were essentially one, that the world was not always divided between China and India on the one hand and continental France and Britain on the other. True. But then differences were bound to arise, partly because of the economic strength of the latter and also because that economic strength brought about a pressing need to make comparisons, to feel superior, to exert force on the Other. Contemporary imperialism at its strongest, most insidious.??
?Sir Arthur Gordon
Cultural imperialism is nothing without the cultural aspect to it, and that aspect comes out most strongly with respect to how different civilisations casually demarcated as the ?Other? are depicted, represented, patronised, and condescended to. Even today. The first few decades of British rule in India, before the Mutiny of 1857, involved an exchange of cultural artefacts, in fact two ways of life. The colonialist found it to his liking to be Indian, to go around town inspecting the ways of life he had intruded on, to make himself a part of the people he had invaded. It was roughly the same phenomenon that unfolded itself in Sri Lanka, with the main bone of contention here being the promise made by the invaders to protect Buddhism and act in place of the deposed King. Stewart-Mackenzie overtly made it his mission to convert our ?heathens? to Christianity, thus severing the ties between the State and the faith. The latter part of the 19th century saw a reversal of this trend, with Sir William Gregory and Sir Arthur Gordon explicitly recognising the place of Buddhism and emphasising neutrality with respect to the relations between their government and our faith.??
Naturally this concurrent system of condescending to and denigrating a culture, as defined by the Other, could only result in an insidious history of looting and expatriation of artefacts on the one hand and conversion and destruction of the people on the other. What was material about our way of life ? the Koh-i-Noor, the Nassak Diamond, Shah Jahan?s Royal Jade Wine Cup ? was what was also exotic about it, while what was superficially not material, and therefore based on ideas and ideology ? faith, feudalism, casteism ? was what irked the colonialist into either doing away with it altogether, by force, or (as with the caste system) transforming and then contorting it for their own benefit. How else could such a ?barbaric? and ?primitive? system of governance as feudalism not give way to capitalism in colonised Ceylon, and how else could the system of casteism which British intellectuals had pondered over and deplored be retained to produce a horde of brown sahibs and Nobodies and Somebodies whose lineage continues today, and who are responsible for many of the economic shortfalls we as a country are suffering at present? How else indeed!??
Mahathma? Gandhi
In Forster?s A Passage to India, the British officials and their wives laugh when Mrs Moore and Miss Quested demand that they get to know Indians. Forster?s novel indicts a conception of India drawn and then shattered by the West. Quested and Moore, the latter more than the former, are bored by the Westerner?s attempts to be polite and to retain their identity amidst the natives. It?s this otherness and aloofness that explains the mixture of amusement, condescension, imitativeness, and patronage which marks much of the relationship between the Orient and the Occident. They want us, they want to overwhelm us, but they can?t because they don?t know us. Because they don?t know us, and because their economic and political strength has made it their prerogative to conquer the rest of the world, they maintain a split personality with respect to how they treat us, and in the end ?exoticise? us.??
A friend of mine pointed out to me recently that all politics is culture, and all culture is politics. Correct. Nothing that is cultural can be cut off from the political, the social. The Mutiny was as much a political statement as the theft of the Koh-i-Noor, and the Uva Wellassa Rebellion was as much a political statement as the destruction of the temple. They are all connected, and interconnected in diverse, intriguing ways. If one is to divide the one from the other one inadvertently conceals the many other interrelationships that make up modernity, especially those between cultural exploitation on the one hand and political exploitation on the other. It?s confusing, in a vague and indiscriminate sense, which is why making sense of the mess we?re in, and sorting out that mess, involves understanding what those interrelationships are.??
Because spatial constrains prevent me from delving into them, I?ll talk about them in next week?s column. Suffice it to say that these interrelationships and even dichotomies, at their most basic, differentiate between the old and the new, not as we know them today, but as the cultural imperialists and the wagers of cultural wars identify it: a tool demarcating what is knowledge and what is not. In turn this has, as I will point out, subsisted on the notion that all knowledge is what the West has made of it, which the East can only emulate. It?s a line of thinking, sinister and prone to all sorts of mischievous extrapolations, which was there during Arthur Balfour?s time in the 19th century. It?s a line of thinking that?s found its way to modernity courtesy of realpolitik diplomacy. Arthur Balfour is dead, but his intellectual heirs live today. They continue their assessment of the Other, the Orient, based on their assumptions of what we know, and do not know, and even willingly profess ignorance about.??
A perusal of Henry Kissinger?s essay ?Domestic Structure and Foreign Policy?, referenced in Edward Said?s monumental book Orientalism, indicates quite clearly that, for the West, the problems of the Third World weren?t problems of exploitation, cultural or political (in any case, such a gap between those two does not exist); rather, it was a problem with the East?s inability to be accurate. All those years, decades, and centuries of oppression and looting and condescension can, for Balfour and for Kissinger, be put down to one simplistic reason: we can?t think, we can?t reason.??
Why and how is this wrong? What other dichotomies does it open us to? What of the gap between modernity as defined by them and modernity as defined by us? What place has globalisation got in the midst of all these distortions? More importantly, how do we differentiate between a modernity we have no choice but to embrace and an uprooted sensibility referred to as modernity which we have to recognise and do away with? All these are pertinent, as questions and as food for thought, and they deserve more than a cursory paragraph. They deserve an entire sketch.?

Timing of marriage
	
A practicing astrologer is usually called upon to find answers to many a question put to them by those consulting them. Of these questions there are a few ones often asked providing answers to which set a formidable challenge to them. Questions requiring timing of important events in life - timing of the marriage in particular are among those an astrologer would find it difficult to answer. For instance, a parent would ask: ?When is the marriage of my son/daughter going to materialize??
Guided by Astrological principles and experience
When a veteran astrologer is asked the above question, he would proceed to time the event going by the principles relating to this subject expounded in the classical works on Astrology supplementing the effort with years of their personal experience.
Before making an attempt at timing of the marriage of a subject, an astrologer has to ascertain whether there are indications that the subject would embark on matrimony. Because there are astrological factors indicated in a horoscope pointing to whether the subject would marry or not marry at all or marriage would come only late ? well past the prime youth.
Standard mode
Usually an astrologer would look for the planet most powerful in producing marriage or most likely to cause marriage and the Dasa or the Antar Dasa of that planet for timing of the marriage. The planet most likely to cause marriage could be the lord of the 7th House, the occupant of the 7th House or a benefic like Jupiter. There are other ways of timing the marriage apart from this standard mode.
For example, according to classical works by ancient Indian sages, the year and the month of marriage can be predicted accurately and precisely going by the Sun?s transit in the Rashi in the Natal Chart and the Navamsa Chart.
Let us consider some astrological factors that either prevent marriage or delay it.
?
?
Venus in Cancer or Leo hemmed in by the Sun and the Moon denies marriage.
	There would be no marriage at all if the Sun, Venus and the Moon are in close conjunction with or in mutual aspect with Mars and Saturn.?
	Mars in Virgo and Saturn in Cancer prevents early marriage.
	Conjunctions, mutual exchange of signs and mutual aspect between Saturn and Moon and/or Saturn and Sun delay marriage.?
	A slow moving planet like Jupiter, Saturn, Rahu or Ketu in the 9th House would prevent an early marriage.
	There would be a long delay in marriage if the 9th lord occupies the 6th, 8th or the 12th House along with Jupiter.?
	If the distance between the Sun and Venus exceeds 43 degrees, there would be obstructions to marriage.
