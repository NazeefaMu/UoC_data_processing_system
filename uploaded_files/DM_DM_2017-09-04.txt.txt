20A to be amended to hold polls by next year: PM
	
The government will hold elections to the nine provincial councils before the end of 2018 by re-wording the 20th Amendment which was rejected by several provincial councils, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said.
He said this during a function at Malkaduwawa in the Kurunegala District on Saturday.
We are ready to introduce a fresh clause to the 20th Amendment to the Constitution compelling the government to hold the provincial council elections before the end of next year, the Prime Minister said. The 20A was prepared to ensure that elections to the nine PCs will be held under the mixed electoral system on a single day prior to the end of 2018."
He said government would introduce legislation shortly to appoint another delimitation commission to demarcate the constituencies at the provincial level and that there would be wards at local government level and constituencies at provincial and national level by 2020.
The Prime Minister assured all stakeholders that PC elections before the end of 2018 and that the govern would not postpone elections indefinitely.
He said the LG elections will be an experimental exercise 60 per cent of the representatives elected under the first-past-the-post system and 40 per cent under the proportional representation system.
It is essential to have a mixed electoral system so that there would be representatives to each constituency while the smaller parties will be represented as well. Constituencies are essential as myself and others such as late Lionel Jayatilake who represented this area came into Parliament in 1977 from a constituency, the Prime Minister said.(Yohan Perera)

Arrest SF with immediate effect: PHU
	
Pivithuru Hela Urumaya (PHU) leader MP Udaya Gammanpila said yesterday Minister and Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka had appeared to have withheld evidence regarding war crimes charge for the past eight years and such suppression news warranted his arrest.
He told a news conference the government should arrest Mr. Fonseka for withholding evidence in connection with the war crime charges levelled against former army commander (Rtd) General Jagath Jayasuriya.
He said Mr. Fonseka betrayed the Army for the second time and therefore could be known as the biggest traitor in the world.
The first time he betrayed the army was the events related to the white flag case. He has tarnished the image of the country and the army by his statement, the MP said.
He said if Mr. Fonseka admits that there were war crimes during his term, there was no need for further allegations to arrest him. (Sheain Fernandopulle)

Common ground in short supply as China hosts BRICS
	

XIAMEN AFP Sept 3, 2017 - The five BRICS nations hold their annual summit in China today under the shadow of a Sino-Indian border spat and growing questions about the groupings relevance. 
Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa-- was formed to allow the biggest emerging economies representing more than 40 percent of humanity to form a united front in a world whose trade and finance rules were written by the West. 
But the bloc seems no closer to that goal as President Xi Jinping convenes its ninth summit in the southeastern Chinese city of Xiamen. Brazilian President Michel Temer and South Africas Jacob Zuma, meanwhile, arrive distracted by political turmoil at home. 

A major threat to BRICS comity lies in tension between nuclear-armed China and India, who recently locked horns over a disputed Himalayan border region. A full-blown crisis was averted as they backed off last week but it has left a bitter aftertaste. There is also mistrust over Chinas ally Pakistan, which Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi -- who also will attend -- has labelled a font of terrorism. 
Modi snubbed a separate summit called by Xi in May to promote the Chinese leaders vision of reinvigorated ancient east-west trading routes, which is seen by many analysts as a Chinese geopolitical power play.

Don't betray people by protecting so-called war heroes: SF
	
Provincial Development Minister, Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka said that it is unjust to protect wrongdoers for the sake of being war heroes clad in military attire and that every politician and every leader of the government should understand that fact.
Addressing a meeting at Kiribathgoda on Monday, Filed Marshal Fonseka said soldiers who committed murders and rapes were punished and hanged and former leaders of the government had punished wrongdoers on behalf of the people.
Addressing journalists, later he said: We are aware that the soldiers who committed rapes and murders were punished. Those who were accused of murder and rape of Manamperi and the murder of Embilipitiya students were hanged to death. Then the leaders of the government took decisions in favour of the people. The leaders should always be on the side of the people. Some people say that I am a traitor. Those who say so were afraid of going beyond Anuradhapura and Polonnaruwa. The people breathe in freely because I finished the war. That is why the media also write at their will. If I am a traitor who has finished the war, then are those who robbed the properties of the country and those who killed the people using white vans and their disciples who committed corruption and frauds patriots There are such disciples in Kelaniya also. I have a problem of understanding them in the true sense of the word: patriots. I gave orders to an army of 200,000 soldiers. One person who was in that army was Jagath Jayasuriya. He was not involved in the operations. The president should be held responsible if he had involved such a cowardice which affected the people when I was giving orders to an army of 200,000.The Army commander is responsible for lawful acts only. The ministers and members of the parliament act as the representatives of the people. There is no change in the army in the past or present. The majors and captains were punished and hanged for wrongdoings, he said.
He also pointed out that the leaders of the government in the past took actions in the name of the people and that the expectations of the people should be fulfilled.
It is not acceptable to shatter the aspirations of the people for the sake of a person being a war hero. Every leader should understand it, he said.
He also said what is said in every media channel and newspapers cannot be believed because they are fabricated and spread distortion among the people.(Lal S. Kumara)

Elle Gunawansa Thera asks President to turn words into action
	
Ven. Elle Gunawansa Thera today commended President Maithripala Sirisena for assuring that he would not allow war crimes charges against former army commander Jagath Jayasuriya but urged him to translate his words into action.
He told a news briefing organised by the Yuthukama Forum that it was the army which saved him when the LTTE attempted to assassinate him twice.
The Thera said a number of other military men who spearheaded the war against the LTTE are being intimidated and punished based on baseless allegations.
We dont object to action being taken if there is credible evidence against someone of being involved in any fraud or violence. As someone who closely associated with the military and helped to re-recruit deserters back to the armies, Im disappointed and saddened over the intimidation of soldiers. The latest development I heard is an attempt to arrest former Navy Commander Wasantha Karannagoda via a B report, he said.
The Thera invited President Sirisena to visit him so that the Thera could brief the President about the real state of affairs in the military.
Referring to the statements made by Field Marshal Minister Sarath Fonseka that General Jayasuriya had committed crimes and that he would give evidence against the retired General, the Thera said the Field Marshal should solve any personnel disputes in person without tarnishing the image of the Army.
I condemn the statement made by the Field Marshal and Im disappointed he made such a derogatory statement. He had differences with former Navy Commander Karannagoda as well. These issues should be sorted out by them without making them public, he said.
However, the Thera said Minister Fonseka was not even appointed by the people of the country and has no mandate to issue such statements.
Meanwhile, Manohara De Silva PC said the Northern Provincial Council (NPC) was attempting to introduce laws to establish a court to hear cases of war crime allegations.
This should not be allowed to proceed. Even the allegations levelled against the UN resolution have no basis. Thats why they cant take swift action against anyone, he said.
Mohan Samaranayake told a news briefing that the fate that befell on Yugoslavia, Serbia and Kosovo would befall Sri Lanka. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

In memory of a beloved grandfather
	
Born in healthy climes of Hatton on December 12, 1943, my grandfather was named Tuan Hadjie Jaldin by my great-grandparents Zainul Abdeen Jaldin and Gnei Seenar Jaldin.
He was married to Zareena Meedin (grandmother) in 1967 and they were blessed with five children. I wish to write a few words in memory of my beloved grandfather on the 6th death anniversary, which fell this Saturday (September 2).
My grandfather obtained his primary education at Royal College Colombo and entered Greenlands College (Isipathana) where he was a standout performer in sports and was the first rugby captain of the school.
Thereafter he played for CR&FC for many years and subsequently was the rugby manager of CR & FC for several years. Whilst at CR&FC he associated and was in the company of many Sri Lankan and European players. He used to relate many stories about the game during that era. Especially, about the rivalry between CR and Havies. Being a reputed athlete in school my grandfathers pet event was the 400 metres and took part in the Asian Veterans Games held in Singapore in 1986 finishing fourth in his event.

"My grandfather obtained his primary education at Royal College Colombo and entered Greenlands College (Isipathana) where he was a standout performer in sports and was the first rugby captain of the school."
He was a very caring husband, father, grandfather, brother and friend. He was such a caring person and loved us the grandchildren more than anything he could have, whenever a visitor came to our place he used to relate our mischievous deeds with them. We used to address him as Kakey and he was always there to support us showing his love at all times. His grandchildren (numbering 15), some of whom he was not fortunate enough to see because they were born after his demise, do resemble him and have qualities in them similar to his.
We are indeed fortunate to have him in our lives since he shared all his stories and memories of his playing career and work experience. We will not meet any other person like him and we all miss him so much.May Almighty Allah grant him Jennathul Firdouse

Iran tests home-grown air defence system: Official
	

TEHRAN AFP Sept3, 2017-Iran has tested its home-grown air defence system, designed to match the Russian S-300, the head of the Revolutionary Guards air defence has said. 
In parallel with the deployment of the S-300, work on Bavar-373 system is underway, Farzad Esmaili told state broadcaster IRIB late Saturday. 
The system is made completely in Iran and some of its parts are different from the S-300. All of its sub-systems have been completed and its missile tests have been conducted. Bavar (which means belief ) is Tehrans first long-range missile defence system, and is set to be operational by March 2018, he added. In 2010, Iran began manufacturing Bavar-373 after the purchase of the S-300 from Russia was suspended due to international sanctions. Russia resumed the sale following the 2015 nuclear deal with world powers which lifted sanctions, and Irans S-300 defence system became operational in March.

## Title: Memories of the late A. H. M. Azwer

Memories of the late A. H. M. Azwer
	
President R. Premadasa, assured me that Azwer would be appointed through the National List to Parliament. That night with great relief we both left for Singapore. 
It is with sadness, I mourn the passing away of my friend Marhmoon Al Haj A. H. M. Azwer. The late Azwer was a warrior with a cause who chartered the course of politics and politicians with his simplicity and loyalty which were his hallmark to his last. 
I fondly recall, it was a Friday morning, just after Morning (Subhu Prayers) in 1988, Azwer was going through his daily mail following the Presidential Election victory. To his dismay he had received a letter of termination for not reporting to work. 
Azwer was the Private Secretary to the then Governor of the Southern Province Al Haj Bakeer Markar. The reason for his failure to report to work was due to the fact that he accompanied the late President Ranasinghe Premadasa during his campaign addressing over 150 meetings across the country. 
This election was marred with violence spanning from North to South. It was a hard fought campaign which was won by the United National Party candidate Ranasinghe Premadasa. 
Azwer waited till sunrise, heart-broken and devastated, got ready and walked to Galle Road and got on a CTB bus and left for Bambalapitiya. Thereafter he walked to my residence. 
Rather exhausted and eyes filled with tears he gave me the letter he had received and said I have been given an award. 
I told him Haji dont worry this is a blessing in disguise. Now your place is in Parliament. 
Are you joking No, no, I will do something in the Presidents Office, Azwer passionately but humbly stated. 
I had planned to go to Singapore that night and invited Azwer to join since he needed a well-deserved rest. 

"The late Azwer was a warrior with a cause who chartered the course of politics and politicians with his simplicity and loyalty which were his hallmark to his last. "

Immediately I called our mutual friend Omar Kamil and conveyed what happened to Azwer and requested him to prepare a CV for Azwer. I asked him to join us for our usual Friday lunch and went to Sucharitha to wish the President Elect Ranasinghe Premadasa. In the meantime, I managed to get a copy of the letter removing Azwer to President Premadasa through the late A. J. Ranasinghe. 
After the jummah prayers and lunch we went to Sucharitha. VIPs including well-wishers were queuing to greet the President Elect. Chief Minister of the Southern Province M.S. Amarasiri walked in and I gave him a copy of the letter sent by the Governor. Azwer was very angry with me for distributing copies of the letter. 
Around 7.30 p.m. we were asked to come to wish the President Elect. The three of us walked in and as soon as President Premadasa saw Azwer jokingly said you have been sacked. Copy of the letter dismissing Azwer was on his table. 
President asked Azwer what his plans were 
In response, I said Sir, you must have him in Parliament. 
President Premadasa said thats a very good idea and asked from which district he would like to come forward to contest. I promptly said 
Sir, we cant field him from any district as he will be travelling with you in the campaign and therefore let him come on the National List and I handed over the CV of Azwer to President Premadasa. 
President Premadasa immediately called Party General Secretary Mr. Ranjan Wijeratne and told him that he wanted Azwer and to include his name in the National List. 
President wanted us to go to Sirikotha and immediately and meet the UNP General Secretary and hand over the CV. 
I told President Premadasa that Azwer was very heartbroken and dejected that morning, when he received the letter and that I consoled him saying that President Premadasa would take care of him. 
The President assured me that Azwer would be appointed through the National List to Parliament. That night with great relief we both left for Singapore. 
Following the General Elections Azwer was nominated to Parliament from the United National Party. This is the story of how Azwer entered Parliament. 
Over the years whether in power or out, Azwer was true to himself, never misused his position and always lived life in a down to earth manner strictly following the five pillars of Islam. 
Azwer leaves us at a crucial juncture in Sri Lankas political landscape, where wisdom and foresight of experienced politicians such as Azwer would be sadly missed. 
May the all mighty Allah grant Azwer the highest place in Jannah.

New Delhi, (Hindustan times), Sept 02, 2017 - Its well-known that smoking even mild or light cigarettes puts you at greater risk of lung cancer, and that smokers are at higher risk of developing mental illnesses. Despite knowing the ill effects, a survey found that 9 in 10 Indians smokers try to quit but fail. 
Doctors at AIIMS now provide an additional reason to quit smoking. They said that tobacco not only causes cancer, its prolonged consumption also may also lead to blindness, and often such cases are irreversible.

## Title: PTL CEO instructed to delete calls, crash PC: Chief Dealer
## Section: Breaking News
## Date: 4 September 2017 03:10 pm
PTL CEO instructed to delete calls, crash PC: Chief Dealer
	
In a shocking new revelation Perpetual Treasuries Chief Dealer Nuwan Salgado testifying at the Presidential Commission of Inquiry (PCoI) today said that based on the instructions of CEO kasun Palisena he had on July 6 asked the IT executive to delete more than 100 phone conversations and crash the operating system of the original computer having the voice logger system.
IT executive Sachith Devatantri in his evidence said he was asked to delete certain phone recordings by Chief Dealer Nuwan Salgado on July 5, 2017, the day before PTL was suspended by Central Bank as a primary dealer.
He said on the instructions of Mr. Salgado, he had also deleted certain conversations that had taken place on March 29 and 30, 2016, which were the days the two controversial bond auctions had taken place.
The witness said initially he was asked to provide all phone conversations relating to those two days by Mr. Palisena on a legal request by the CID to do so and thereby he provided all unedited conversations in two CDs.
However, Mr. Salgado had approached him with those two CDs and asked to delete certain phone calls that it contained and re-produce the CDs. Thereafter, he had deleted several calls from the two CDs and returned it to Mr. Salgado in the presence of Mr. Palisena.
However, after the second deletion of several call recordings from the main computer data base of the system on July 5, 2016, the witness had proposed to Mr. Salgado that the main computer should be replaced thereafter because the deleted details can be retrieved through a forensic examination from the computer hard drive.
The witness yesterday admitted to having watched several You Tube videos on how to destroy the Operating System (OS) of a computer and crashed the computer OS on July 6, 2017, the day after the second deletion.
When the main computer with the voice recording system was restarted it had not uploaded its OS and the voice recording system was also dysfunctional.
However, the witness had earlier said he did not know what happened to the main computer, but yesterday admitted that he had crashed it after the deletion.
Additional Solicitor General Yasantha Kodagoda who led the evidence, in a sarcastic manner told the Commission in Sinhala: You Tube ekenuth Hena Gahanna puluwan kiyala dan therenawa (We are now aware that lightning can strike even via the You Tube).
Mr. Devathantri explained that thereafter he had installed the system on another new computer and configured the system on July 21. He said he had replaced the edited voice recordings to the new system as well. Even though he had configured it in the new computer, to run the system with all facilities such as CLI, the system had to be configured in an advanced manner by service provider Metropolitan Ltd.
However this was the computer and the system that Mr. Palisena had looked at in August after the request was made by the Commission.
The witness said after the re-installation on July 6, 2017 he had conveyed what had happened to Mr. Salgado saying wade hari (work done) in the presence of Mr. Palisena.
Mr. Devathantri admitted that he was fully aware about the investigation going on against PTL at the time he had deleted the conversations based on Mr. Salgado's instructions.
ASG Kodagoda: You earlier said that you were unaware about the computer crash
Witness: Yes
Justice Chitrasiri: Why did you say so
W: I knew it was a wrong and that I should apologize for it.
Presidents Counsel Kalinga Indatissa thereafter cross-examining the witness drew the Commissions attention to the fact that his client Palisena had not instructed the IT person to do such deletions or crash the computer but it was Mr. Salgado who had done so.
After the conclusion of the cross examination, Justice Prasanna Jayawardena questioned the witness briskly.
Justice Jayawardena: So, before crashing the computer, the system contained the CLI facility, call details and voice recordings in it till July 4, 2017
Witness: Yes
J: Then you deleted several voice recordings on July 5 and crashed the computer on July 6
W: Yes
J: Who can access the server room apart from you
W: Apart from me there was a key to the Server room kept in the company safe.
At this point, ASG Kodagoda asked the witness about two names and the witness was unaware of them. The ASG said those names were in the witness' initial affidavit and those are the names of those who attested the affidavit that the witness now failed to identify.
On an earlier occasion Mr. Indatissa PC appearing for Mr. Palisena raised a similar argument when Metropolitan Chief Engineer was testifying, which led to a heated argument between ASG Dappula de Livera and Mr. Indatissa.
Adding some amusement into the proceedings, ASG Kodagoda said, It was sweet revenge and reciprocal treatment for Mr. Indatissa's earlier argument.
When questioned by Mr. Indatissa PC, the witness affirmed that he was not asked by any counsel to give false information in his initial affidavit.
After a short adjournment, the Commission then called PTL Chief Dealer Nuwan Salgado.
It was explained that Mr. Salgado had recorded statements with the CID last weekend regarding the matter and had submitted his evidence in an affidavit to the Commission.
It was based on that affidavit Mr. Salgado testified before the Commission.
He said he joined PTL in 2013 with little prior experience in the field and thereafter in February 2015 he was promoted to the post of chief dealer.
This had happened because PTL's then CEO Arjun Aloysius had resigned from his position after his father-in-law Arjun Mahendran was appointed Central Bank Governor.
After Mr. Aloysius stepped down from his post, the then chief dealer Kasun Palisena was promoted CEO and subsequently Mr. Salgado succeeded as chief dealer in February 2015, before the controversial auction.
Justice Jayawardena: Before you were appointed as chief dealer were you an ordinary dealer
Witness: Yes
J: And you are aware that prior to February 2015, Kasun Palisena (then chief dealer) and Arjun Aloysius (then CEO) were dealing in the business
W: Yes
J: So, after you became chief dealer did that same pattern of decision making by Aloysius and Palisena continue
W: Arjun Aloysius would have checked on the business
J: Aloysius father was not involved in the security trading, Arjun was the one who has the expertise in this field, so he would have frequently checked on the business
W: Yes
J: So, he would discuss about dealing matters daily with Palisena, because a days transactions could make a huge differences in this field, right
W: Yes, as the owner he would have checked them daily.
J: Therefore Aloysius would have been aware of any big decision taken by Palisena, right
W: Yes
After a series of questions by Justice Jayawardena and ASG Kodagoda the witness said that apart from general trading matters Mr. Palisena would have informed Arjun Aloysius before making any significant decision.
Justice Jayawardena: If Palisena wanted to bid more than the offered value in an auction such as to place a bid of Rs.15 billion, then he would have to inform Aloysius, right
W: Yes
J: He cannot do it alone. Then that decision should necessarily would have come after consulting Arjun Aloysius, right
W: Yes
When questioned over the phone recording system by ASG Kodagoda, it was revealed that the witness had received instructions from Mr. Palisena to listen to all phone recordings by November 2016. It was revealed that the instructions were received to identify any phone conversations which are harmful to PTL.
This instruction was received after the regulatory measure that had been taken by the CBSL in November restricting PTLs primary dealer business.
Thereafter, Mr. Salgado had been listening to the phone recordings periodically and had identified a number of recordings which could be harmful to PTL.
The witness admitted that he asked IT executive Devathantri to delete some call recordings in April 2016 relating to the phone conversations on March 29 and 30, 2016 on the instructions of Kasun Palisena.
He also said that he again informed the IT executive to delete several phone recordings on July 5, 2017 on the instructions of Kasun Palisena.
Mr. Salgado was of the view that he and Palisena were also aware of the re-installation of the system, the destruction made to the OS of the main computer and the replacement of the main computer relating to the system.
The witness revealed that more than 100 voice recordings were deleted in which Palisena, Gajan (dealer), Kaushitha (dealer) and he had been involved.
At this point, the Commission asked Mr. Gajan to leave the court room. Mr. Gajan was the person who had been consulting the PTL's lawyers throughout the proceedings.
However, when questioned, the witness said he cannot recall the exact outside entity involved in those deleted conversations as there were many.
Consequently, the commission repeatedly questioned him as to who were the entities found as outsiders (apart from the PTL end) in those deleted phone conversations
Justice Jayawardena: You cannot not know about the outside parties who were involved in these conversations because you had identified them, and we cannot believe that you now have forgotten them. Therefore, you should know who the outsiders were.
W: I cannot place an exact entity, it was some phone conversations that I looked into as harmful to the PTL, and some were even between Aloysius and Palisena as well.
Then Justice Jayawardena went on to question the witness as to what were the matters he regarded as harmful when listening to the recordings.
When questioned by Justice Jayawardena, the witness admitted that he had identified as harmful conversations that gave any impression that the PTL had pushed the market and impacted market yield rates.
However, the witness was then repeatedly questioned as to why he cannot reveal about the outside party of one single conversation that he had instructed to delete.
Justice Chithrasiri: Your position of not remembering other sides cannot be accepted. What made you think of identifying those deleted calls as bad against PTL
W: I cant recall them, now I have given all original data to the Commission so thereby (the commission) can identify them if needed.
Justice Jayawardena: If frankly saying, it is not acceptable to believe that you cannot remember at least one outside party. So, if there were calls relating to PTL pushing rates, you would have deleted them, right
W: Yes
J: If there were calls relating to receiving inside information, you would have also deleted those phone recordings right
Witness was silent
J: I am giving every opportunity to you now.
W: Yes I would have deleted them.
J: So, those deleted calls fall to one of the above categories, right
W: Yes
The witness was also questioned whether he had deleted specifically the phone conversations relating to PTL and EPF. The witness said he cannot remember them.
The Commission and ASG Kodagoda also questioned him whether he had concluded deals with Saman Kumara the former EPF dealer. He said he never concluded deals with him.
Justice Jayawardena questioning the witness observed that PTL had considerably gained their capability of trading (leverage) in Government Securities from the February 27, 2015 auction, by aqcuiring long-term bonds and subsequently in November 2015 they had sold them to the EPF.
The witness was of the view that he only dealt with Udayaseelan (dealer of EPF at that time) and cannot take responsibility over the transactions that happened in November with EPF because the majority of them were conducted by Kasun Palisena and Saman Kumara.
However, after giving some shocking revelations against PTL, ASG Yasantha Kodagoda explained the witness about the Victim Protection Act and his rights and other means of protection from any harassment or any diverse actions against his employment by the employer. The ASG also instructed him that he was entitled to inform any such conduct extended against him to the CID or Police because such actions are regarded as non-bailable offences.
The Witness also apologized the Commission for providing fabricated evidence. Mr. Salgado said he had not received any additional reward for committing such actfrom PTL but only involved in such deletion of voice recordings on the instruction of Kasun Palisena. And he also said that he testified independently without being suppressed by anyone.
Mr. Salgado had also submitted four CDs of the original back-up data which was taken by Devathantri prior to the alteration made to the recording system on July 5, 2017.
These CDs will now have the missing conversations relating to secondary market transactions between PTL and EPF. (Shehan Chamika Silva)

With the number of tourist arrivals set to increase, Tourism Promotion Minister John Amaratunga has requested the government to make arrangements to ready the Ratmalana Airport to handle international flight operations.
Minister Amaratunga told Daily Mirror that the Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA) would not be able to cope with the demands of having to cater to increased influx of tourists into the country.
Until the BIA is expanded and developed we will have to come up with an alternate plan to ensure that we can handle the extra arrivals comfortably. We can easily land small aircraft at the Ratmalana Airport and for this to happen it would have to be developed. An aircraft with around 100 passengers on board, originating from nearby countries can land at the airport in Ratmalana, he said.
Asked about the Mattala International Airport, he said it too would have to be used one day to accommodate the increase in incoming flights. There is a lot of congestion being experienced at the BIA at present. That is why I suggested that we look at landing some flights in Ratmalana as an option, he said.(Kelum Bandara)

Sri Lanka Police marks the 151st anniversary
	
September 3 was the historic day, on which Police was formally established in the isle of Sri Lanka. When making reference to the world history in relation to Police, Sri Lanka Police history is considered as one of the longest. Sir Robert Peel, who is known as the father of Modern Policing, established the Metropolitan Police in England in 1829 and it is considered as the first formally established Police in the world. 37 years after its establishment, Sri Lanka Police was established in 1866 as per the Ordinance No. 16 of 1865 and today marks its 151st anniversary.
 "Police University will be established in order to obtain higher education on Police Science and Criminal Justice "

A systematically evolving Policing method can be observed in every developed society. The chronicles of Mahawamsa also records that during the reign of King Pandukabhaya (437 - 367 B.C.), there had been a position named, Nagara Guththika, which had similar duties of Police even under the monarchical system of ancient Lanka.
Further, the establishment of a rural administrative system and building the city of Anuradhapura as the administrative centre had begun during the same period. Later on, various kings took measures to maintain order among the citizens and it has been recorded in the history that King Udaya II (887 - 898 A.D.) had established a proper Gamsabha system. 
The Police Service was informally established in Sri Lanka by the British as a means of providing a security measure through patrolling for ensuring safety of the warehouses of Colombo harbour in 1795. Later on, the need for a formal Police service came up both due to the inadequacy of the prevailing Police Vidhane system to prevent various picaresque acts and due to various appeals made by the public officers highlighting the importance of a proper Police service. 
Consequently, Sri Lanka Police Service was informally established around 1832, subsequent to the division of Colombo area into 15 Police zones and the attachment of 10 Police Sergeants, 05 Police Constables and 150 peons. Afterwards, Police stations had been established in other areas such as, Galle, Negombo and Kandy. 
As the first Sri Lankan Superintendent of Police, Mr. Lokubanda Dunuwila, who was holding office as Uva Disawe at the time, was appointed the Superintendent of Police in Kandy. After the official establishment of the Police Service as per the Ordinance No. 16 of 1865, G. W. R. Campbell, the Chief Superintendent of Police, was appointed the first Inspector General of Police and the appointment of Sir Richard Aluwihare the first Sri Lankan Inspector General of Police in 1947 is a turning point in the history of Police. He has rendered an immense service towards the endurance of Police and the welfare of Police Officers. 
The first incident of sacrificing a life by a Police officer, while he was on duty for maintaining law and order, had occurred at Uthuwankanda, Mawanella on Monday, 21stMarch, 1864. 
While conducting an operation carried out to arrest a suspect named, Deekirikevage Saradiel, the Police officer named Sabhan was shot by another suspect, Mammale Marikkar and had faced death in a brave manner. 
Through the establishment of an organised Police Service after adopting the Police Ordinance No. 16 of 1865, it becomes evident that the commencement of maintaining the register of Police war heroes had helped the establishment of an organised policing method. 
It can be mentioned with pride that Sri Lanka Police is the leading institution for protecting Law & Order among the oldest public institutions in Sri Lanka. 
With profound respect, we should commemorate the demise of 3,117 Police officers, who had valiantly sacrificed their lives for ensuring the safety of lives and property of the public and the territorial integrity of Sri Lanka. 
	September 3 was the historic day, on which Police was formally established in the isle of Sri Lanka.
	
	
	Sri Lanka Police was established in 1866 as per the Ordinance No. 16 of 1865
	
	
	The first Sri Lankan Superintendent of Police was Lokubanda Dunuwila
	
	
	G. W. R. Campbell, the Chief Superintendent of Police, was appointed the first Inspector General of Police
	
	
	Sir Richard Aluwihare the first Sri Lankan Inspector General of Police (1947) 
	
	
	The first incident of sacrificing a life by a Police officer, occurred at Uthuwankanda, Mawanella in 1864.
	
	
	Expeditious steps are being taken to increase the organisational structure to 600 functional Police Stations.
	

An incident that took place in 1915 had marked the commencement of Police riot control duties to protect lives and property of the people of this country. It has been recorded in history that the Martial Law had been first imposed on Western and Sabaragamuwa Provinces by the then Government and that power had been delegated to the Police to provide security. 
Further, the Police had performed their duty to minimise the loss of lives and property with minimum facilities and strength during many violent situations erupted before the period (1948-1971) of forming of Sri Lankan Republic.
During this time, the first Woman Police Constable was killed and it is worth commemorating the demise of 15 female officers, who sacrificed their lives during the war against terrorism. 
In addition to that, Sri Lanka Police had fought at the risk of their lives together with tri forces for the territorial integrity of the motherland during the thirty years of war with terrorism and internal tensions that had erupted in the southern area of the island. 
The Sri Lankan Police which serves  24 hours to protect lives and property of each and every citizen consists of about 87,000 officers and 484 Police Stations. 
Expeditious steps are being taken to increase this organisational structure to 600 functional Police Stations. Special attention has been given by the government under the leadership the of President, Prime Minister, Minister of Law & Order and Inspector General of Police in this regard. 
The Sri Lanka Police, which faced significant challenges during the most recent 50 years out of its 150 year period, have also achieved innumerable victories. Specially, during the time of war and post-war period, combating crimes had been carried out successfully. 
Apart from the above, it is one of the responsibilities of Police to contribute to the duties performed by the other public institutes.
Furthermore, new targets have been set for achieving the development of public welfare. Accordingly, 

	It is expected to increase the current trend of solving property crimes. 
	Adopting new technology for analysing circumstantial evidence. 
	Getting fingerprint comparison results within a short period of time using a fully automated computer programme. 
	Computer programmes which have been designed to analyse criminal reports would help achieve this target. 
	Arrangements have been made to bring down the number of fatal accidents and severe property damage further by 10%. To achieve this target, 
	
	Paying more attention to preventing road accidents, especially in sparsely populated areas. 
	Measures are taken to conduct traffic management duties by having constant vigilance by the side of main roads and byroads which have been developed. 
	Priority lines to promote public transport are expected to be introduced to reduce road traffic and accidents. 
"Police serves 24 hours a day to protect every citizen consists of about 87,000 officers and 484 Police Stations..."
Contributing towards making President Maithripala Sirisenas concept of bringing about a country free of narcotics a reality. To achieve this target, 
	Establishing a Special Police Division and continually carrying out operations for the prevention of narcotics by coordinating with the other relevant government institutions. 
	Directing those who are addicted towards rehabilitation. 
	Eradicating the use of tobacco products. 


The programme of establishing mobile Police stations named Gamata Policiya had been implemented covering a period of one month, enabling the public to receive services from the Police easily. Concurrently, Police officers had rendered their services to implement the programmes with the village community under the themes of religious, educational, cultural, health, sports and public affairs. During such events, steps had been taken to make an enormous contribution to environmental protection for idyllic surroundings and to provide constant contribution to eradicate dengue.
	
	Steps have been taken to provide speedy solutions to the problems that the Police officer had been facing for a long period of time. Specially, measure had been taken to expedite the necessary process for taking disciplinary measures against officers away from work because of interdiction or temporary suspension due to various legal issues. 
	A Police University will be established in order to obtain higher education on Police Science and Criminal Justice. It would help bring about Police officers equipped with knowledge and attitude for Sri Lanka Police. When those subjects gain popularity within the society, it will contribute towards elevating the quality of being law-abiding among people. 

"The Police Service was informally established in Sri Lanka by the British as a means of providing a security measure through patrolling ...."
In commemoration of the 151st Police Day, the official ceremony will be held under the leadership of Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe on Tuesday, September 7 at 2.30 p.m. at the grounds of the Police Field Force Headquarters, Bambalapitiya.

Trump leads international condemnation of North Korea nuclear test
	

President Donald Trump led international censure of North Koreas announcement Sunday that it had tested a hydrogen bomb, saying its actions were very hostile and dangerous to the United States. 
Pyongyangs key ally China expressed strong condemnation while South Korean President Moon Jae-In called for the strongest punishment against the North, including new UN sanctions to completely
isolate it. 
Tensions on the Korean peninsula have spiralled in recent weeks, with North Korea testing an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) and threatening to fire missiles towards the US Pacific island of Guam and Trump warning he would rain fire and fury on the country. After North Korea sent a missile over Japan last week, Trump said the time for talks was over and on Sunday he tweeted that appeasement would not work. 
Trump had previously pledged the North would not get an ICBM and has warned that Washingtons weapons are locked and loaded. 
China, which is hosting a summit of the five BRICS nations, said it expresses resolute opposition and strong condemnation over Pyongyangs sixth nuclear test, which was felt in Chinese cities hundreds of kilometres from North Koreas borders. 
The North should stop taking mistaken actions which worsen the situation and are also not in line with its own interests, and effectively return to the track of solving the problem through dialogue, the Chinese foreign ministry said.

We've no faith in the presidential committee: GMOA
	
The GMOA said today it had no faith in the presidential committee appointed to resolve the SAITM issue and as such the government would have to face severe consequences soon.
GMOA executive committee member Prasad Kolambage told a news briefing that the association has lost confidence in the committee appointed by President Maithripala Sirisena because it consists of pro-SAITM individuals.
The committee which included the Attorney General (AG), University Grants Commission Chairman Prof. Mohan de Silva, Health Ministry Secretary and the Higher Education Ministry Secretary have spoken in favour of SATIM on earlier occasions. We do not count on these individuals to provide an impartial solution to the matter, he said.
Dr. Kolambage said Chairman of the committee, Deputy Minister Harsha De Silvas stance on this matter was not clear and as such his decision was uncertain.
He said the fact that the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) or the GMOA was not represented in the committee and this would result in a decision favourable to SAITM.
Dr. Kolambage said the GMOA was tricked and mislead on several occasions and would not let it to happen again and proceed with its trade union action.
We will remain quiet until the committee submits its report. If the solutions are pro-SAITM, the government will have to suffer the consequences, he said.
Meanwhile, the GMOA said the post of SLMC Chairman has been vacant for two months and the relevant authorities including Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne failed to make an appointment for the only institution that could ensure the countrys medical education quality. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)
