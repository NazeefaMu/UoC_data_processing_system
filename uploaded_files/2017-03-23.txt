Activist fined for screening ?No fire Zone? in Malaysia
	
Activist Lena Hendry was on Thursday (23) fined RM10,000 (apprx 2200 US Dollar) in default one year's jail by a Malaysian magistrate's court for screening a documentary on the Sri Lankan civil war- No Fire Zone: The Killing Fields of Sri Lanka- without prior approval from the Film Censorship Board of Malaysia (LPF), NST Online reported.
Lena, 32, dressed in a red top and black jeans, looked at her friends and supporters in the public gallery in disbelief, when magistrate Mohd Rehan Mohd Aris, imposed the fine.
She was convicted of showing the documentary on Feb 21.
On March 10, last year, the same magistrate's court here acquitted and discharged Lena without having her defence called.
However, on Sept 21 the same year, the High Court overturned her acquittal and ordered her to enter defence.
Lena, a former programme coordinator for Pusat KOMAS, a human rights organisation, was charged on Sept 19, 2013 with screening a documentary titled "No Fire Zone: The Killing Fields of Sri Lanka" without approval from the Censorship Board.
She was accused of committing the offence at the Kuala Lumpur and Selangor Chinese Assembly Hall in Kuala Lumpur, at 9pm on July 3, 2013.
Deputy public prosecutors Muhammad Farith Muhammad Faizal and Nurakmal Farhan Aziz prosecuted while New Sin Yew and Joshua Tay, represented Lena.

Country ruled by politicians not by law-GMOA
	
The Government Medical Officers? Association (GMOA) on Wednesday wrote to Inspector General of Police (IGP) Pujith Jayasundara requesting for his immediate intervention to punish the wrongdoers in connection with the issues of the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM) in Malabe.
GMOA Assistant Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge told a media briefing that at present authorities related to the SAITM were attempting to go above the law.
?The Police has still not taken any action against SAITM CEO Dr. Sameera Senaratne, even though they have revealed that he had allegedly staged the shooting which took place in Malabe to falsely portray his life was in danger,? he said.
He said therefore the GMOA had requested the IGP to investigate the issue and added that the country?s judicial system should be equal to all.
He said the SAITM had usually followed all its practices despite the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) had rejected to approve it.
He also said the SAITM issue was second only to the alleged controversial bond sale issue.
?Recently, SAITM Chairman Dr. Neville Fernando has forcibly entered Kethumathi Maternity Hospital in Panadura with a group of some other men. They have destroyed several properties belonging to the hospital including several things used to protest against SAITM. He has no right to enter a public place and destroy those State properties,? he said.
He said no investigation was carried out on this incident by the Panadura Police.
He also said the country was ruled by the politicians instead of the judicial system. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)

Goldman Sachs to move London jobs abroad on Brexit
	
AFP: US investment bank Goldman Sachs said it plans to move jobs from London to elsewhere in Europe over the next 18 months because of Brexit.
Goldman Sachs International chief executive Richard Gnodde told CNBC television that the bank will ?hire people inside of Europe itself and there will be some movement? out of London.
He said Goldman would be raising headcount in offices outside Britain by ?hundreds? as the country negotiates its exit from the EU. ?We start with a significant European footprint already, we are licensed with banks in Germany and in France,? said Gnodde.
?Whatever the outcome, London will remain for us a very significant regional hub and a significant global hub,? he added. Goldman employs around 6,000 staff in Britain.
Britain will launch the process of leaving the European Union on March 29, setting a historic and uncharted course to become the first country to withdraw from the bloc. Nine months after the UK?s stunning referendum vote for Brexit, Prime Minister Theresa May?s government will finally trigger Article 50 of the EU?s Lisbon Treaty next week, starting a two-year departure.
HSBC bank has said it would likely switch 1,000 jobs to Paris from London owing to Brexit, while Swiss lender UBS and US peer JP Morgan have indicated that jobs will be moved out of the British capital for the same reason.
Britain?s financial sector has long feared the loss of ?passporting? rights which allow EU member states to trade across national borders. That provides a crucial gateway for companies to access the rest of the bloc.

London Attack: ?Heroic? British politician attempted to save cop
	
A British foreign minister bloodied his hands attempting to save the life of a police officer who was stabbed on the grounds of Britain's Parliament in what was described Wednesday as a "terrorist incident."
After an individual drove a 4x4 through a crowd outside the Palace of Westminster, shots were fired and a police officer was stabbed. Tobias Ellwood, a conservative member of Parliament and former soldier who was close to the incident, rushed to the officer's side. The officer later died of his wounds.
Photos of Ellwood ? once an infantry captain in the Royal Green Jackets ? show him in a blue suit giving the unidentified police officer mouth-to-mouth and attempting to staunch the blood flowing from the stab wounds.
Ellwood reportedly stayed with the officer until an ambulance arrived. A later photo shows him with blood smeared on his forehead.
The assailant reportedly barreled across Westminster Bridge in a vehicle, striking and killing one woman. He then crashed into a fence before eyewitnesses saw him charge through the gates of Westminster Palace with a knife. That is where the law enforcement officer who Ellwood helped was stabbed.
London police said three victims, as well as the assailant, were killed in the attack and 20 were injured.
British law enforcement said they were treating this "as a terrorist incident until we know otherwise."
A dual national of the United States and United Kingdom, Ellwood has represented a constituency in Southern England since 2005. He became the Foreign Minister for the Middle East and Africa in July 2014.
Ellwood lost his brother in the 2002 Bali bombing that killed 202 people.
Norway's Foreign Minister, Borge Brende, called Ellwood a good friend and "a true hero that worked to save lives today following the horrible attack in London."
This isn't the first time the British MP has put his heroics on display.
According to the BBC, Ellwood was taken to a hospital in 2009 and temporarily lost hearing in one ear after he fought a gang in his constituency. Another group threw stones at him in 2008 when he threatened to call the police after witnessing them urinate in a constituent's garden.
Ellwood served in Northern Ireland, Cyprus, Kuwait, Germany, Gibraltar and Bosnia while in the military. He's currently an active Army reservist. (NBC News)

Islamic State claims responsibility for attack outside UK parliament in London, Amag News Agency reported
A policeman was stabbed, an assailant was shot and 20 people injured in what police said they were treating as a terrorist incident near Britain's parliament.
Four people have died in the incident Sky News said on Twitter, citing unspecified sources. Earlier it was reported that a woman had died and other people were being treated for "catastrophic" injuries after the attack in Westminster in London.
Amid confusing scenes, it appeared the incident may have unfolded in several locations, including the busy bridge where tourists often congregate to take pictures of Big Ben and other attractions. The incident took place on the first anniversary of attacks on Brussels in Belgium."
British Prime Minister Theresa May, who had just completed her weekly Prime Minister s Questions, was seen being ushered into a car as gunfire rang out at Parliament during the incident.
Downing Street said the Prime Minister was "safe" as an emergency services helicopter was seen landing in Parliament Square, which has been cordoned off and closed to traffic. "The Prime Minister was brought back to Number 10 from Parliament. She is currently monitoring the situation," a Downing Street spokesperson said.

Mastercard and Eko-Pay to step up B2B payment digitalization in Asia
	
Recognizing the growing opportunity and need to help digitize business-to-business (B2B) transactions, Mastercard announced its partnership with Eko-Pay to introduce Eko-B2B, a new best-in-class digital payment solution for businesses in Asia Pacific.
?Eko-B2B will provide businesses with an automated payment solution that enables them to streamline workflows and improve productivity for B2B payment transactions. Powered by Eko-Pay, a technology company with proprietary solutions for financial and non-financial transactions, Eko-B2B seamlessly integrates with the Mastercard inControl platform to facilitate business payments, reducing inefficiencies and improving transparency.?
?According to a study[] by global consulting firm McKinsey on commercial payment growth in Asia Pacific, 90 percent of B2B payments in the region are still conducted in cash, representing a significant opportunity to digitize the payment system. ?Expansion of customer and supplier networks across markets, growth of cross-border transactions and a large informal economy of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) are key reasons cited for the growth of B2B payments in the region. ?
The Eko-B2B solution brings greater transparency and efficiencies to all parties in the B2B payment process. ?Vendor and supplier web portals willenable round-the-clock access to current and historical payment details and dashboards that track key business performance statistics, eliminating the need for manual payment systems and their associated complications and operational inefficiencies.
?Multiple payment systems, non-electronic payment methods and supplier resistance are just some of the common pain points for businesses as they attempt to digitize their payment system across their supplier network. With the Eko-B2B solution, Eko-Pay offers the option to manage this onboarding process for the business,allowing them to experience the full benefits of a digital B2B payment solution with minimal time invested.?
??Eko-Pay is very pleased to partner with Mastercard on this solution that bridges a critical gap in the B2B payment environment,? said Jean-Pierre Gagnon, Chief Executive Officer of Eko-Pay. ??The entire platform was designed with simplicity in mind to allow for rapid adoption through local and international business networks and provide a long tail acceptance enablement solution.? ?
?Nagesh Devata, senior vice-president, Acceptance and Merchant Development, Asia Pacific, Mastercard, said, ?Many businesses today, regardless of size, engage with a network of suppliers and across multiple markets as they look to not just survive but thrive in a global marketplace. Yet many businesses still rely heavily on traditional, non-digital forms of payments to process business transactions, resulting in wasted time and resources unnecessarily. For businesses that have adopted digital payment solutions, they often face resistance and challenges from their supplier network and vendors in implementing these new processes. By partnering with Eko-Pay to launch a fully automated solution that allows them to experience the enhanced efficiencies and real-time cost savings of using digital payment solutions, we are looking to solve for some of these key pain points.?The Eko-B2B solution is now available in Asia Pacific, interested businesses should reach out to Mastercard or?

Protecting Marine Species: The Immediate Need of the Hour
	
Dolphin and whale watching have taken the Sri Lankan tourism industry to newer heights. But unfortunately these species are no longer safe at sea. A video of people gathering dead dolphins in Trincomalee went viral last week and this created much tension on social media. When investigated it was found that 12 dolphins were killed by nine fishermen who were arrested by the Trincomalee Crime Prevention Unit.?
Keeping this in mind, Life Online contacted several environmentalists and marine experts to find out how such killings of dolphins would reflect badly on their population as well as on the tourism industry.?
Highly unlikely that these dolphins were killed due to nets: Howard Martenstyn?
Speaking to Life Online, renowned marine mammal researcher Howard Martenstyn said that it is highly unlikely that these dolphins would have died due to the nets. ?Especially in the case of spinner dolphins they only come up to about 50-70m depth of water. But what is most likely is that I have seen fishermen using ?laila nets? at the port of Trincomalee. They have to encircle the animal or use dynamite in order to kill it.??
We need a separate judicial system to address environmental issues: Dr. Terney Pradeep Kumara?
Dr. Terney Pradeep Kumara, General Manager of the Marine Environment Protection Authority said that usually the fishermen are aware of dolphin frequented areas and they know how to use the nets. ?Dolphins are a marine resource that boosts tourism and killing dolphins is a crime. When using beach seine nets, also known as ?ma dala? in Sinhalese terms, what they usually do is they keep one end at the shore, lay it across the area and keeps grabbing. Dolphins usually get entangled to another type of net known as purse seine nets or ?laila nets? which are illegal. But some fishermen are very careful and I have seen them trying to save the animals sometimes by jumping off their boats and trying to remove the nets. These mammals are an air-breathing species and from what I saw in the video it is clearly visible that these fishermen purposely kill the animals. The villagers too have surrounded the scene and even they were giving a hand for the fishermen to kill the animals. This is absolutely ridiculous because such practices should never happen in any part of the world.?
Speaking further, Dr. Terney said that dolphins are a human-friendly species and they cost more when alive than when dead. ?One of the major drawbacks I see is that there is no proper judicial system to address environmental issues. Usually the judges and the legal personnel involved do not have any idea about the environment. Therefore an experienced panel should be appointed to investigate and give decisions to those found guilty of killing animals or destroying natural resources. Also the public needs to be aware of what happens around them and the media should play an active role in trying to spread awareness on environmental issues.??

Killing dolphins is a punishable crime: Sajeewa Chamikara?
In his comments to Life Online, top environmentalist Sajeewa Chamikara said that according to the Flora and Fauna Protection Ordinance the dolphin is a highly protected species. ?Therefore killing a protected species is a punishable crime. Anybody found guilty of violating what is mentioned under Section 30 of the Flora and Fauna Protection Ordinance could be arrested without a warrant. This includes killing, torturing, selling or auctioning of dolphins. The fine would be between Rs. 50,000 and one lakh and the suspects will have to serve two years in jail. Usually these mammals are found in herds and if they get entangled in nets and several dolphins in the will be caught. Sometimes these mammals even reach the shore to find food. Most of these fishermen are unaware of how they should be using nets and the law should be strictly enforced on those found guilty of killing these mammals.??
Incidents of dolphin deaths in Sri Lanka?
The recent incident was not the first instance when dolphins became victims of seine nets.?
2016 : Two fishermen in Mirissa were arrested for killing dolphins. From back in the 1980s harpooning dolphins have been a common practice in Mirissa.?
2013 : 50 dolphins were killed in the island of Baththalangunduwa in Kalpitiya and 15 persons were arrested

At a press conference held in the office of the Democratic Left Front, JO member MP Vasudeva Nanayakkara said they were geared up to break the unity government and know how to rule the country.
He claimed during the period of the unity governance, most of the people?s fundamental rights were torn down. He said they would not act under the UNP rule and will topple the Prime Minister and the UNP power that is unhealthy to the country.
MP Nanayakkara said they don?t wish to topple the whole government however; they are against Ranil Wickremesinghe?s moves towards the country.
?We are prepared to topple the government. If the anti-people acts (such as postponing elections) continue, we certainly would group the people and create a mass national force,? he said.
Further, he said the JO can paralyze the unity government if the authorities failed to hold the election before the end of the year.
?The unity government is moving towards its down fall. Ahead of the national election we are ready to form an interim government. If the government listened to our demands and hold the elections in the right time we would not have to do this,? he said. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

SL woman held at Bangalore airport for drug smuggling
	
The officials of the Air Intelligence and Customs at Kempegowda International Airport (KIA) in Bangalore arrested a 39-year-old Sri Lankan woman, who was smuggling contraband drugs to Colombo, last week.
The officials said that Fathima Azeeka Junaideen was found carrying 1.640 grams of amphetamine and hashish, worth Rs 64 lakh, concealed in pesticide packets. She claimed that she runs a beauty parlour in Colombo and would visit Chennai frequently for purchasing beauty products.
Further enquiry revealed that Fathima?s husband had asked her to hand over sachets of pesticides with the brand name ?Barrix Control? to a person at Colombo airport. Based on a tip-off by intelligence officials, she was arrested at Kempegowda International Airport when she was flying to Colombo from Chennai via Bengaluru.
Fathima used to rent a room in Chennai whenever she came to India and stayed there till she received the ?pesticide sachets? to be carried to Colombo, on the instruction of her husband.
The Customs officials suspect that the woman was being used for smuggling the drugs. She was produced before a magistrate and was remanded in judicial custody. (Deccan Herald)

The Kandyan Manor
	
Embracing serenity in the hill country?
Kandy is a picturesque city surrounded with lush greeneries and misty hills but is often disturbed by its busy spontaneity on the streets. Once you move away from this hustle and bustle, the breathtaking countryside towards Katugastota offers serene views to the passing traveller. Situated within a few kilometres from the Kandy town and a few metres down the Katugastota-Yatiwawala Road is The Kandyan Manor, a scenic hideaway, seductively embraced by its calm surroundings.?
Interior?
Once you step in to The Kandyan Manor you are greeted by a turquoise blue mini swimming pool at its entrance. Giving the outlook of an ancient Ceylonese house from one point and a modern house on the other, The Kandyan Manor is decorated with antiques in various sizes and shapes and has been restored to accommodate and satisfy its guests. As such, from minute ornaments to colourful lampshades, abstract wall hangings and wooden furniture, the venue has a blend of modernity embedded in its unique collection of antiques.?
Accommodation?
The Kandyan Manor has three standard rooms and two chalets ? the standard rooms are equipped with basic amenities, modern d?cor, a spacious seating area and an en-suite bathroom with a toilet and shower facilities. The chalets on the other hand offer breathtaking views of the surroundings and they are equipped with queen-size beds, bedside lamps, fan and bathroom with toilet and shower facilities.?
Nigel?s Chalet for instance, which has been named after the first born in the family is an ideal space for couples. It has its own bathroom setting and is offered on a bed and breakfast basis. The rooms are quite spacious and since the venue is located away from the city, guests can have a peaceful and a relaxing nap during the day or night.?
Free WiFi is available in public areas and the home-stay also provides laundry services and free parking.?
Dining?
The dining area is located towards the back of the venue overlooking the beautifully landscaped garden. The d?cor here is quite fascinating as it has a modern concept with a twist of antiquity.

While at The Kandyan Manor guests would get a chance to see a traditional Sri Lankan meal being prepared using firewood. This would mainly be an interesting experience for tourists during their stay at The Kandyan Manor.?
Things to do?
Since it is situated a few kilometres away from the Kandy town, it is always advisable to leave early if you are planning to explore Kandy as there is huge traffic throughout the day.

The Prestantia Chorale and Chraft presents an Easter Choral Reflection:  ?Wounds  of Healing? to sup
	
The Prestantia Chorale and Chraft presents an Easter Choral Reflection: ?Wounds of Healing? to support the Deaf and Blind School ?
The Prestantia Chorale in collaboration with Chraft (Christian Arts Foundation) will present ?Wounds of Healing?, a choral reflection for the fourth consecutive year to celebrate the Lent and Easter season. The programme will be held at the Cathedral of Christ the Living Saviour, Colombo 7, on Sunday, April 2 at 7 pm (free admission). The music is directed by Dr. Priyeshni Peiris Perera and the original script is adapted from Steve Moore?s narrative based on the human struggle of Thomas? refusal to believe and experience the inner healing which comes through Christ. The chorale wishes to raise funds through a ?Free will love offering? for the Deaf and Blind School in Ratmalana. ??
As in the past years, this event is free and open to both young and old with an interest in music. The Prestantia Chorale promises an evening of reflective, spirit-filled choral music to celebrate the season as witnessed in the past years by attendees. ?
The Prestantia Chorale?
The Prestantia Chorale was formed in February 2013 under the musical direction of Dr. Priyeshni P. Perera. Dr. Perera, who obtained her Doctorate in Music from the Texas Tech University, USA, returned to Sri Lanka in 2010 and established the Prestantia School of Music (www.music.edu.lk) and linked the choir calling it ?The Prestantia Chorale.? The word prestantia means ?Excellence? in Latin. She is a full-time lecturer at the Department of Western Music at the University of Visual and Performing Arts (UVPA), Colombo 7. ?
The chorale had its humble beginnings in 2013, with eight people singing at an Easter Morning Sunrise Service at the Holy Emmanuel Church (HEC), upon a humble request from Rev. Keerthisiri Fernando from HEC and currently the Archdeacon, Nuwara Eliya Diocese. Keeping with tradition as it were, the Chorale has continued to present an Easter-themed choral production each year; ?The Borrowed Tomb? in the successive years 2014 and 2015 and ?On Angels Wings? in 2016. ?
At present, the choir consists of twenty-two passionate singers who devote their precious time to sing in four-part (SATB) with the Prestantia Chorale. They are; Pavithra Madapatha, Ranthilini Fernando, Sudarshi Nonis, Sunara Ranasinghe, Praveeni Fernando, Prashanthi Perera, Privanka Fonseka, (Dr) Amal Shehan Perera, Janaka Fernando, Melantha Fernando, Wasantha Kumara Geekiyanage, (Rev.) Upul Fernando, Shavan De Mel, Pabasara Jayarathne, Tharaka Peiris, Dave Fernando, Shamal Fernando, Michelle Refuge, Sanduni Perera, (Dr.) Sanuri Pandikorala and Siroshni Illangage. The group consists of professional and amateur musicians who are bankers, doctors, lawyers, members of the clergy, software engineers and musicians by profession. ?
The Chorale in?
2014-2016 ?
The Prestantia Chorale has performed at Church Services, weddings, on national television and the ?MTV Good Morning Show? at various occasions. The presentations of Easter Musicals such as ?The Borrowed Tomb? by David Clydesdale (2014 and 2015) and ?On Wings of Angels? (2016) by Dhanan Senathirajah has functioned as musical underpinnings of Prestantia Chorale?s evolution as a leading choir in the country.?
The highlight for the Chorale was the presentation of the National Anthem sung SATB in both Sinhala and Tamil languages, probably for the first time in Sri Lanka in 2015 to an original SATB arrangement by Dr. Priyeshni P. Perera. In Dr. Perera?s own words, the hope was that ?this choral music initiative will contribute in a small way towards ethnic reconciliation in our motherland.? ?
The chorale has appeared as guest performers at the ?Prestantia Musica 2014 & 2015,? the ?Throne of Praise? and ?The Priests in Concert? at the Holy Emmanuel Church among others. Subsequently upon requests that were made, the musicals were re-presented at the Methodist Churches as fundraisers. ??
Wounds of Healing ?
The choir plays a prominent role in communicating a variety of emotions through songs ranging from classical to contemporary repertoire. With the energetic and lush choral harmonies of Thomas Rutter, David Clydesdale, Steve Townsend and Keith Getty and selections from ?The Messiah? by G.F. Handel, combined with the creative writing abilities of Steve Moore, this Easter musical dramatically portrays the story of Christ?s death and resurrection through the eyes of three symbolic characters namely, Thomas, Peter, and Mary Magdalene.?
The audience will experience the emotions of how the death and resurrection of Jesus affected their lives. It will portray the inner tensions the disciples went through during this period, the self-inflicted emotional turmoil behind Peter?s denial of Jesus and the doubt that Thomas had to overcome to be ultimately healed through the resurrection of Jesus. ??
The Junior Choir of the Prestantia Music School will join with the Chorale this year too. ??
The instrumental ensemble will consist of (Dr.) Priyeshni P. Perera (Piano), Christopher Prins (Drums), Nimalka Marian (Keyboard Synthesizer), Saranga Cooray (Cello), Sachiththa Fernando (Violin) and Tironi Rathnayake (Flute).

They keep you awake at night,  even when they?re switched off
	
There?s an old saying in sleep medicine: bedrooms are for slumber, sex and nothing else. ?Nowadays, though, that idea is all but obsolete ? thanks to the all-invading domination of smartphones, tablets and laptops. Yet a wealth of research demonstrates why everyone should banish screens from the bedroom ? even if they?re switched off. And it?s not just because of the light they generate.
Experts fear the havoc they wreak on our sleep is sentencing us ? and our children ? to lives dogged by obesity, diabetes and even Alzheimer?s. ?The blue light that electronic screens emit is a major source of insomnia and sleep problems. Numerous studies, such as a report in the journal Current Biology in 2013, warn that the blue wavelength suppresses production of the sleep-inducing brain chemical, melatonin ? making it harder to fall asleep and to enjoy good quality sleep. The thrill of social media also puts a stop to unbroken slumber.?
?Children are taking electronic devices to bed and continuing to use them through the night,? Dr Simon Archer, a reader in sleep genetics at the University of Surrey, told Good Health.
A sense of unprecedented excitement may explain why the mere presence of screens in bedrooms ? even if smart phones and tablets are switched off ? disrupts children?s sleep.

Update: 5 dead, 40 injured in London attack
	
Five people have died and at least 40 were injured after an attacker drove a car along a pavement in Westminster, stabbed a policeman and was shot dead by police in the grounds of Parliament.
The dead officer has been named as PC Keith Palmer, 48, a husband and father.
PM Theresa May said the attack was "sick and depraved" and struck at values of liberty, democracy and freedom of speech.
The attacker has not been named by police.
Acting Deputy Commissioner and head of counter terrorism at the Metropolitan Police, Mark Rowley, said they think they know who he is and that he was inspired by international and Islamist-related terrorism, but gave no further details.
The attack unfolded at about 14.40 GMT when a single attacker drove a car along a pavement over Westminster Bridge, near the Houses of Parliament in central London, killing at least two people and injuring many more.
The car then crashed into railings outside the Houses of Parliament.
The attacker, armed with a knife, ran to Parliament where he was confronted by the police. PC Palmer - who was not armed - was then stabbed and killed.
The attacker was shot dead by armed officers.
Mr Rowley paid tribute to PC Palmer, saying: "He was someone who left for work today expecting to return home at the end of his shift, and he had every right to expect that would happen." (BBC)

The Police informed Court about the inconvenience that is likely to be caused because of the demonstration. They said the safety and secrutiy of prisoners being escorted to and from prison may also be affected.
They sought a stay order or some suitable order on the demonstration.

Wijeyadasa on Wimal: 'Prove innocence before going on hunger strike'
	
Justice Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe said today MP Wimal Weerawansa should prove in court that he had not misused a single state vehicle instead of going on a hunger strike.
Responding to an allegation made by the joint opposition that there was political revenge behind Mr. Weerawansa's arrest,Mr. Rajapakshe told parliament that there was no political matters behind this and added that it was only the implementation of law against him.
"He was not arrested by the President, Prime Minister or the Law and Order Minister. He was arrested by the police. We have established the independent police commission and made the police service independent. We have no power to order the police. The Joint opposition cannot accuse us of taking political revenge. There was no one behind this. Only the Law is behind it," he said.
He said it was a fundamental right of anyone to go on a hunger strike and added that Mr. Weerawansa also had that right to do so.
"He can continue his hunger strike genuinely. He may have some purpose to achieve. So he can continue it until he achieves it," he said( Ajith Siriwardana and Yohan Perera)
