Action against BC
	
The Cabinet decided to initiate investigations into the failure on the part of the Commissioners of the Bribery Commission to dispense with complaints lodged with it during the last four years, a minister said yesterday.
Justice Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe told the Daily Mirror the Cabinet took the decision yesterday after a considering a proposal by him.
Rajapakshe, a Colombo district candidate of the United National Party (UNP), noted as many as 1,900 complaints had been lodged with the Commission during the last four years, but only a handful of cases had been looked into.
The Minister said two commissioners had virtually been sitting on the complaints, particularly against the politicians.
?We will initiate inquiries against these two commissioners. Only after we appointed a new Director General, we were able to start investigations and to file action. In fact, there are bribery charges against these two commissioners. But, no investigation has been done,? he said.
?We want to build public confidence in the system in dealing with bribery and corruption,? he said.
The UNP-led alliance has pledged to enact strong anti-corruption laws in case it is elected to office. It has been announced in the manifesto. (Kelum Bandara)

AG clears MR in RADA case
	
	Even though the original complaint in connection with an alleged fraud at the Reconstruction and Development Agency (RADA) was lodged against former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, in the course of investigations, the former President had not been found to be among the perpetrators of the crime, the Attorney General informed the Supreme Court today.
	Additional Solicitor General Yasantha Kodagoda, appearing on behalf of the Attorney General made this submission, when a fundamental rights petition filed by former MP Tiran Alles came up before the three-judge-bench of the Supreme Court.
	?The original complaint was not made against the petitioner Tiran Alles but against Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa and Emil Khanthan. In the course of the investigations, the perpetrators of the crime in fact was not the former President but others. The original complaint should have been made against the petitioner,? Mr. Kodagoda said.
	ASG Kodagoda submitted to Court that the potential arrest of petitioner Tiran Alles was based on credible information sequent to the investigations carried out by the police Special Investigations Unit.
	?There are reasonable grounds to believe that the petitioner has committed a cognizable offence and there is a statutory duty of police to arrest him even without a warrant,? said ASG.
	Mr. Kodagoda further submitted to Court that Mr. Alles had been appointed by former President for the position of both chairman and Chief Executive Officer of RADA.
	He further stated that RADA was established in November 2005 by the then President as a Special Agency responsible for overseeing rehabilitation and development following the tsunami. He stated RADA was entrusted with several functions including Jaya Lanka Housing project to construct 1200 houses in the Tsunami affected Northern and Eastern provinces. However, Mr. Kodagoda stated that no single house had been constructed by the RADA under this program.
	President?s Counsel Romesh de Silva, appearing for the petitioner stated that prospective arrest of his client would restrict his liberty.
	He stated that his client had become the non-executive chairman of RADA in 2005 and resigned from it on January 2007. He stated that police had acted in bad faith (mala fide) and got a travel ban against his client even without informing him of the same. Mr. Silva further stated that Police Special Investigation Unit (SIU) was conducting an investigation against his client about an incident that had taken place in 2006, after a lapse of nine years.

?I don?t believe there is any agreement of the nature that the Channel 4 portrays?- Mahishini
	
Foreign Affairs Ministry Spokesperson Mahishini Colonne yesterday said that she didn?t believe there was any agreement between the UN and Sri Lanka regarding a domestic inquiry as claimed by the UK based Channel-4 news agency.
Responding to a question posed at the daily media briefing regarding an alleged agreement between the UN and Sri Lanka on UN support for a domestic inquiry, Ms. ColonNe first said she didn?t want to comment on something that was reported on Channel 4.
When asked if she could confirm that there was such an agreement with the UN, she said, ?I don?t believe there is any agreement of the nature that the Channel 4 portrays.?
However, she said the Undersecretary General of the UN Political Affairs Department, during a visit here in March, had averred that the UN was ready to help Sri Lanka.
"He said, 'As requested by Sri Lanka, the UN is committed to assisting in the process of accountability and reconciliation through the peace building fund and other facilities as appropriate. But it is first and foremost for the Sri Lankans themselves to shape how to address the issues of the past in order to find a common future,' ? she said, quoting the undersecretary general.
She said they had no further comment on the Channel-4 report because that was essentially based on the remarks made by the Northern Province Chief Minister in relation to the UN. ?So we do not to get involved in commenting on that,? she said.
?From the time President Sirisena was appointed and even before that, even in his election campaign and in the 100 days work programme, he stated that Sri Lanka would take certain steps to strengthen human rights, the rule of law, good governance and so on, and that Sri Lanka remains ready to be engaged with the International Community, with countries, with International Organisations and so on, in carrying out this task,? she said.
She further said, "It is not something that we can do quickly as some people expect, and it is also not something that we can do alone. We are party to certain conventions of the United Nations and we have acceded to those conventions, as a Sovereign State, not because of any pressure exerted by anyone. And even on the questions of accountability, the 100 days work programme, I think, in point 93, states that since we are not a party to the ICC Rome Statute, the matter of justice and accountability and so on, rests with the country concerned, that is with Sri Lanka."

Coal bid runs into fresh controversy
	
	The fifty billion rupee per year tender to supply coal to the Lakvijaya Power Plant in Norochcholai for three years has run into fresh controversy, with the chairman of the Technical Evaluation Committee (TEC) reportedly refusing to chair the technical committee for the spot tender scheduled for August 13, Daily Mirror learns.
	Mr. D.K.B.S Thilakasena, the chairman of the TEC, which oversaw the previous bid (which is currently under a cloud due to the U-turn made by the Standing Cabinet Appointed Procurement Committee (SCAPC)), has refused to sit on the committee for the spot tender that was called for, sources said.
	The spot tender was called, following appeals to the Procurement Appeal Board (PAB) by at least four bidders following the U-turn by SCAPC, in order to supply a portion of the coal required for the running of the plant, until a decision is made regarding the tender.
	The issue surfaced following the award of the tender, on June 13, by the Lanka Coal Company to Noble Resources International Pte Ltd, to supply 2.2 million tonnes of coal per year for a period of three years to run the plant. It is said to be one of the biggest tenders awarded in recent times.
	The tender was awarded, after bids were opened on June 11, following a competitive bidding process in which seven companies competed to win the tender.
	The tenders had been vetted by the TEC and a tender board of Lanka Coal Company (a subsidiary of the Ceylon Electricity Board) after which the tender had been awarded to the company which met the required specifications at the lowest price.
	However, on June 29, Swiss Singapore Overseas Enterprises Pte Ltd, a company which had tendered a higher bid, had written to SCAPC calling for a reevaluation of its bid. The communication by the Swiss company was against the code prescribed for bidders.
	The issue took a different turn after SCAPC, on the very same day it received the communication from the disgruntled bidder, wrote to the TEC of Lanka Coal Company and ordered them to re scrutinise the tenders and to disregard two vital criteria it had previously imposed.
	The directive from SCAPC had been issued by the secretary of the SCAPC, who is also an associate of the secretary of the Ministry of Power and Energy, Dr. B. M. S Batagoda.
	Authoritative sources told Daily Mirror that the two vital criteria (clauses 1.4 and 1.5 of the bid document) were with regard to the size of the coal.
	?The issues around these two criteria had been considered extensively during the bidding process. They can?t suddenly decide that they should not form a part of the bid document. That is completely out of line,? the source said.
	Thereafter, on July 3, SCAPC received the reevaluation report of the TEC, following its directive of June 29th. On July 6 the tender was awarded to the Swiss company, causing the other bidders to cry foul and appeal the awarding of the tender.
	?The efficiency of this whole thing is nothing but suspicious. You have a letter from a disgruntled bidder and SCAPC seems to have worked overtime, because on the same day they write to LCC. They receive the reevaluation on the July 3, which is a Friday. And next Monday (July 6) itself, the tender is awarded to Swiss Singapore, which, if nothing else, just doesn?t look right,? the source said.
	The issue remains at a standstill, with the Procurement Appeal Board yet to make a decision on the appeals.
	?Due to this delay we will not have coal for at least a short time, and the power plant will come to a halt. The losses from this can run into billions of the tax payers? rupees, because restarting the turbines will incur a colossal expense. Just to restart the Norochcholai turbines, you need 450,000 litres of diesel,? another source said.
	When contacted, the chairman of Lanka Coal Company, Maithri Gunarathne, refused to comment. However, the secretary to the Ministry of Power and Energy (and member of SCAPC), Dr. B. M. S Batagoda told Daily Mirror that there was nothing unusual about the process.
	?The company which had initially been granted the tender was the company that had always won this tender during the last five years. There was nothing wrong in their communicating with SCAPC. We have chosen the most suitable bidder,? he said.
	Mr. Thilakasena, who chaired the TEC, when contacted on Monday, refused to comment to the media and said that he continues to function as the chairman of the Technical Evaluation Committee. (Hafeel Farisz and Shihara Maduwage)

EC: Desist from hate speech
	
	Elections Commissioner Mahinda Deshapriya said on Tuesday that the use of hate speech, in canvassing votes, was a serious offence under the Parliamentary Elections Act, and therefore he urged the candidates to desist from such acts.
	Addressing the media, Deshapriya said he learnt of propaganda activities asking voters to cast their ballot for candidates of a particular ethnic or religious group under whatever party.
	He said he had received complaints about such propaganda through the social media.
	Likewise, he said any election related propaganda, aimed at the promotion of separatism, was unconstitutional, as MPs to be elected, had to take oaths under Article 6 of the Constitution to uphold the unitary status of the country.
	Also, he noted that his Department would take steps to the convenience of personals with disabilities in turning up at polling stations for casting their ballots on the day of polling.
	Already, he noted that Rs. 1.5 million had been spent to facilitate them.
	?We may have to spend at least Rs.10 million in this respect. We have to facilitate such persons to access polling stations located upstairs in buildings. If we fix additional door ways, it will cost us Rs.30, 000 each,? he said.
	The Commissioner requested even senior citizens to inform him if they were slated to have difficulties in accessing their polling stations.
	?If they have problems due to long walks involved, I should be informed of it. I look into the concerns of such senior citizens with physical weaknesses,? he said. (Kelum Bandara)

Fitch affirms Continental Insurance Lanka at ?A-(lka)?/Stable
	
		 		 
		 
			
Fitch Ratings Lanka has affirmed Sri Lanka-based Continental Insurance Lanka Limited?s (CILL) national insurer financial strength rating and national long-term rating of ?A-(lka)?. The outlook is stable.
The ratings reflect CILL?s satisfactory capitalisation in terms of regulatory solvency, relatively short operating history and modest market share. The ratings also reflect the recent capital infusion by its parent, Distilleries Company of Sri Lanka PLC (DCSL; AAA(lka)/Stable). CILL is fully owned by DCSL through holding company Melsta Corp Limited.
CILL was established as a non-life insurer in 2010 and by 2014, even though the non-life industry is intensely competitive, it managed to account for a modest 3.2 percent of the segment?s gross written premiums. CILL?s combined ratio of around 104 percent for 2014 compares well with its peers? and is satisfactory, especially given the company?s short operating history. Fitch expects improvements to the ratio to be slow given the tough competition in the industry.
CILL regulatory solvency ratio improved to 2.52x by end-December 2014 (end-December 2013: 1.77x), comfortably above the regulatory required level of 1x. The improvement follows DCSL?s injection of Rs.250 million of capital in July 2014. Fitch expects CILL?s regulatory solvency ratio to trend down as the business expands, but remain above 2x.
DCSL is a well-established, leading alcoholic beverage manufacturer in Sri Lanka. CILL benefits from group business and operational synergies.

	Air crash investigators have 'a high degree of confidence' that a piece of wreckage found on the Indian Ocean island of La Reunion is from a Boeing 777 - the same model as the doomed MH370 which disappeared in March 2014.
	Since the Boeing 777 was introduced in 1994, there have been five incidents - including MH370 -? which have led to the destruction of the aircraft. MH370 is the only aircraft of its type which has vanished over the sea.
	Investigators will need to examine closely the wreckage to link it to MH370, but it was the only aircraft of its type lost over water. (dailymail)

I will not engage in political propaganda supporting TNA: CV
	
	I will not engage in any political propaganda supporting the TNA candidates, instead take a neutral stance, NPC Chief Minister C.V Wigneswaran said in a communiqu? issued in that context.
	He said that the General Elections was announced when he was on a tour abroad and many a people question about his stance now.
	"Ten candidates are vying for seven seats in the Jaffna Electoral District while nine candidates are contesting for six seats in the Wanni Electoral District. Hence, there is a contradictory situation among the candidates within the party to secure the highest number of preferential votes.I was chosen as the common candidate for the post of Chief Minister at the NPC in the year 2013. When I assumed duties as Chief Minister the constituent parties of the TNA found fault with me citing that I did not take a neutral stance. They leveled criticism against me that I was biased towards the ITAK. They also spelled out that as the Chief Minister of the NPC I must act in an impartial manner.Nevertheless, I hold the view that although the TNA chose me as the Chief Minister; it is not ethical for me to support them at the forthcoming general elections.I have no issue with any member elected by the people irrespective of the party he belonged to; however, those elected by the people should work with dedication and also upholding the unity. I believe that priority should be given to the progress and the well being of the people than the parties," he said
	He said that It was disheartening to note that the rehabilitation, resettlement and the development projects were being implemented in a haphazard manner without taking into consideration the dire needs of the people. The political solution was drifting away from the people and also justice was delayed for those battered by the war.
	"Under these circumstances, you are called upon to cast your valuable votes at the forthcoming General Elections. Hence, it is your bounden duty to elect the most capable candidates to represent you in the Parliament who can courageously face the challenges that I have mentioned.We have to exercise our democratic rights and make our political journey vibrant. We have to pay due attention to our task and maintain absolute transparency and accountability and desist behaving like tourists visiting places during elections, The Chief Minister said in his communiqu?.

## Title: MH370 debris found off Reunion coast?

MH370 debris found off Reunion coast?
	
	Debris found in the western Indian Ocean on Wednesday appears to be part of a Boeing 777, the same model as Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 that disappeared in 2014, according to a source close to the investigation.
	The source said there is a unique element to the Boeing 777?s flaperon, a wing component, that Boeing observers believe they are seeing in photos.
	The debris was found Wednesday off the coast of Reunion Island, a French department in the western Indian Ocean. It is being examined to see if it is connected to flight MH370, a member of the French air force in Reunion said Wednesday.
	The debris was found off the coast of St. Andre, a community on the island, according to Adjutant Christian Retournat.
	Officials conducted an initial assessment of the debris using photographs.
	The source stressed the observations are preliminary.
	K.S. Narendran, whose wife was on the plane, said he was reticent to call the discovery a major development.
	?I think this is very early days yet. All we know is that a small part has been found. It is still a little early to suggest it does belong to MH370,? he told CNN?s ?Erin Burnett OutFront? from India. ?I think it is premature to feel that it is all coming to a close or that we are even closer to the truth.?
	Sarah Bajc, whose partner, Philip Wood, was on MH370, said her ?heart has been in my throat for most of the day.?
	During the initial days of the search for the plane, there were several reports of possible debris sightings in the waters closer to where authorities believe the plane went down, but none of those was actual wreckage. Bajc said as an emotional safety mechanism she disbelieves any reports like Wednesday?s discovery.
	She wants verification, she told ?Anderson Cooper 360?.?
	?If ultimately this is the piece of the wing, then that little thread of hope that I have been holding on to will, will have to break. And reality will have to take over,? she said holding back tears. ?But, yeah, up until now, I and most of the family members have continued to believe that until we have a body ? we can?t give up hoping they will still come back.?
	If this turns out to be a piece of MH370, it would be the first piece of evidence that the plane crashed.
	Earlier, Retournat said the debris appeared to be a wing flap and had been taken to the island, about 380 nautical miles off the coast of Madagascar.
	The Malaysian government has dispatched a team to Reunion Island to investigate the debris, Malaysian Minister of Transportation Liow Tiong Lai said in New York.
	?We need to verify. We have wreckage found that needs to be further verified before we can further confirm if it belongs to MH370. So we have dispatched a team to investigate on these issues and we hope that we can identify it as soon as possible,? the minister said.
	Malaysia Airlines said it was working with authorities to determine where the part came from.
	?At the moment, it would be too premature for the airline to speculate on the origin of the flaperon,? the carrier said.
	CNN analysts said there are indications the airplane part could be from a Boeing 777, and if that?s the case, it?s likely from MH370.
	Making the determination should be ?very simple? because the serial numbers riveted to numerous parts of the plane can be linked to not only the plane?s model, but also the exact aircraft, said CNN aviation analyst Les Abend, who flew 777s during his 30 years as a pilot.
	This means crash investigators may be able to figure it out from photographs of the part ? which could be an aileron, a flap or a flaperon ? even before arriving on the island, he said.
	There are at least three elements of the discovery that are consistent with MH370, said CNN safety analyst David Soucie. The first is that the part appears to have been torn off the aircraft.
	?This is from a sudden impact, it looks like to me,? Soucie said.
	There also is a seal on the top of the part that ?is consistent with what I would see on an inside flap on a triple 7,? he said, and the barnacles on the part are consistent with the ?parasitic activity? that would take place from being underwater so long.
	However, the part appears to be coated in white paint, which would run counter to Soucie?s other observations in that the 777?s parts would be coated in zinc chromate, not paint. Soucie acknowledged, however, that the part could be coated in something from the ocean.
	?If it is a part from a triple 7, we can be fairly confident it is from 370 because there just haven?t been that many triple 7 crashes and there haven?t been any in this area,? said CNN aviation analyst Mary Schiavo.
	Antoine Forestier, a journalist on the island where the debris was found, said people who were on shore gardening saw the plane part drifting in the ocean.
	Reporters from Antenne Reunion looked at the debris, which Forestier said was about 2 meters by 1 meter (6.5 feet by 3 feet).
	There was a marking ?BB670<U+2033> on the part.
	Soucie said he believes the number is a part number, though it might be from a subcontractor.
	The head of the Australian Transport Safety Bureau, the agency tasked by Malaysia with leading the search for MH370, said the piece of debris is ?not inconsistent? with drift modeling done by Australian authorities.
	?If there was something from MH370 it could have reached Reunion Island from the area we?re covering,? said ATSB Chief Commissioner Martin Dolan. ?It?s not inconsistent with the drift modeling we?ve done. It?s not inconsistent with the search area we?re covering.?
	Dolan would not say how likely it was that any debris would move in a westerly direction.
	?There?s a range of possibilities,? he said. ?It?s not an exact science.? Dolan said surface currents, wind direction and how high an object was floating in the water might all play a role.
	Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, with 239 people aboard, disappeared after a late-night take off from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, on March 8, 2014, bound for Beijing.
	Authorities have said they still don?t know why it turned dramatically off course over the sea between Malaysia and Vietnam, or where exactly its errant journey finished.
	An international team of experts used satellite data to calculate that the plane eventually went down in the southern Indian Ocean. Search teams have been combing a vast area of the seafloor in the southern Indian Ocean, hunting for traces of the passenger jet, about 2,300 miles (3,700 kilometers) from where the debris was found.
	The Malaysian government eventually declared the loss of Malaysia Airlines flight 370 an accident and all of its passengers and crew presumed dead. (CNN)

Nations Trust continues steady performance
	
?Nations Trust Bank closed the first six months ending June 30, 2015 with a post-tax profit of Rs.1,257 million a growth of 9 percent over the corresponding period. The results for the quarter were significantly better with post-tax profits recording a commendable growth of 26 percent. Operating margins improved during the first six months as core revenue recorded a faster rate of growth than operating expenses.?
However, the improved operating margins did not translate to a similar bottom line growth owning to higher impairment charges. Loans and advances recorded a steady growth of 5 percent for the first six months amidst high market liquidity and intense price competition.
Net interest income recorded a growth of 8 percent over the previous period with NIMs narrowing marginally. The drop in interest expenses of 20 percent outweighed the drop in interest income of 6 percent thereby improving NII. The challenges present in the current low interest rate operating environment was somewhat mitigated by timely re-pricing of assets and liabilities. Portfolios such as corporate and leasing in particular, felt the pinch of declining yields and narrowing NIMs. ?The bank continued its push for growth in low-cost deposits which recorded a 6 percent growth with CASA improving to 31 percent of deposits. ?
Net fees and commission income grew by 17 percent for the period under review. Good growth was recorded across the spectrum of fee-based products and services. Fee-bases income from cards recorded a growth of 18 percent followed by a 11 percent growth in other areas including remittances, bancassurance and transactional fees.?
Trade-related fee income also recorded a moderate growth of 11 percent as import/export volumes picked up considerably in the 2Q. ?Foreign exchange income recorded good growth with enhanced customer volumes and favourable rate movements benefiting proprietary trading. Trading income attributable to FIS portfolio recorded a loss for the period owing to marked to market losses as a result of unfavourable movements in the underlying government securities yields.
The impairment charge for the period amounted to Rs.732 million, which is a 65 percent increase compared to the corresponding period of 2014. This comprised of a one off provision booked during 1Q for specific facilities. Impairment charge excluding this one off provision improved by 21 percent compared to the corresponding period. The drop in collective impairment for the current period is mainly attributable to reversals made on account of the pawning portfolio compared to the higher charges made in the corresponding period. Collective impairment on credit cards also recorded a significant drop.?
Operating expenses were contained at a growth of 5 percent with the cost income ratio trending down to 52 percent from 54 percent reported for the corresponding period. Continued focus on process efficiencies and digitalized workflows has assisted in yielding productivity improvements across the bank. The higher growth of 39 percent in depreciation and amortization charges is due to the core-banking upgrade which was implemented in 3Q of 2014.
The capital position was sound at Rs.16.6Bn with Capital Adequacy Ratios both at Tier 1 and 2 maintained at comfortable levels. Drop in ROE is due to the relatively lower post-tax profit for the six months. An upward trend in ROE is expected with the anticipated growth in quarterly profits.?
Commenting on the results and achievements, CEO/Executive Director Renuka Fernando stated, ?The positive macro outlook is expected to continue and we are confident that the positive trends seen in credit growth will continue beyond 2015. The banking landscape is fast changing with the low interest rate regime bringing about many challenges but at the same time opportunities.
We are embracing new concepts of banking such as digitalization, lean, analytics and making them part of our culture to maintain relevance. People continue to be our biggest strength and we believe that the development and retention of our talent is vital. This will be one of the key areas of focus for Nations Trust Bank as we look towards concluding yet another rewarding year.??
Nations Trust Bank PLC is one of the fastest growing banks in Sri Lanka today, operating 91 branches and an ATM network covering 127 locations and is the issuer and sole acquirer for American Express cards in Sri Lanka.

Rajiv Gandhi killers will not be hanged, confirms SC
	
	The Supreme Court dismissed on Wednesday the centre?s curative petition against its 2014 judgment commuting the death sentence of three convicts to life term in the Rajiv Gandhi assassination case, upholding a verdict that brought into focus the inordinate delays in executions in India.
	?
	The central government plea had sought a review of last year?s decision when the SC reduced the punishment while saying the prisoners had been on death row for too long.
	?
	?We have gone through the curative petitions and the relevant documents. In our opinion, no case is made out within the parameters indicated in the decision of this court (in the Rupa Hurra case laying down the principle of curative petition),? read the order from the bench of chief justice HL Dattu and justices TS Thakur, AR Dave, Ranjan Gogoi and Shiva Kirti Singh on Wednesday.
	The former prime minister was killed by a suicide bomber from the LTTE while campaigning in an election in Tamil Nadu?s Sriperumbudur city in 1991 after he dispatched Indian troops to aid Sri Lanka in its fight against the separatist militant group.
	A total of 26 people were found guilty of conspiring to kill Gandhi, but 19 of them were later acquitted.
	The Centre said in its curative petition that the killers did not deserve any mercy and the victims in the assassination case were not heard before the death penalty was commuted.
	The top court on February 18 last year commuted the sentences of AG Perarivalan alias Arivu, Sriharan alias Murugan and T Suthentiraraja alias Santhan, who were the only ones facing the death penalty in the case at the time, in a decision that the Centre challenged in the SC two days later.
	?
	The Union government's plea opposing a Tamil Nadu government decision to release the seven convicts in the Rajiv Gandhi assassination case awaits a final verdict from the court.
	About 500 people are on death row in India, many of them for years. 1993 Mumbai blasts convict Yakub Memon, who is slated to be hanged on Wednesday, was awarded the death penalty in 2007.
	The court had earlier said it was essential for the convicts to suffer and realise the victim?s pain through ?slow poison?.
	?
	While commuting the sentences, the Supreme Court left the option open for Tamil Nadu to grant remissions to the convicts under the executive powers of the state government. The state announced remission for the prisoners within a day of the judgment.
	?
	On the Centre's plea, the SC stayed the release of the convicts and said the state was expected to comply with procedure and remission was not automatic. (Hindustan Times)

	Sri Lanka Rupavahini Corporation (SLRC) Chairman Somaratne Dissanayake said today that he would resign his post with effect from August 3, due to personal reasons.
	Dr. Dissanayake, a veteran film director, backed Maithripala Sirisena at the last presidential election. He was afterwards appointed chairman of the SLRC.
	?I have already tendered my resignation to the ministry. If I am requested to continue as SLRC chairman, I shall have to consider it. I have not yet decided whether to remain in the SLRC,? he said.
	He said he hoped that he could make a better impact in the battle against the corrupt persons who are contesting the elections by engaging directly with the people rather than working as SLRC chairman.
	?I will get on to the stage of the United National Front for Good Governance (UNFGG) to win more benefits for the people in the future, in a well planned manner,? he said.  (Chaturanga Pradeep)

Staggering Rs.150 bn for Central expressway: Dullas
	
The UPFA today claimed that the UNP, which alleged the then UPFA government of spending excessive amount of funds for expressway constructions, had estimated to spend a staggering amount of Rs. 150 billion for the construction of the Kadawatha-Meerigama segment of the Central Expressway.
UPFA Matara District candidate Dullas Alahapperuma said the UNP led government had also reduced the number of lanes of the central expressway, previously named as the northern expressway, leading to Jaffna via Kandy from Colombo.
He said the frequent allegations of the UNP were that the UPFA government had obtained loans from China for higher rates, the expressway projects were unsolicited, funds allocated for projects were staggering and the Rajapaksa family was benefitting from these projects.
?Today, the same UNP had obtained funds from the Exim Bank of China to the project and estimated Rs. 150 billion to complete the Kadawatha-Meerigama segment after reducing the number of lanes to four from six.? This is a day-light robbery only second to the Central Bank Bond sale issue. The UNP charged that it seemed we were using gold to construct expressways and it seems today they are using gold and platinum in constructing expressways,? Mr. Alahapperuma said. (LSP)
