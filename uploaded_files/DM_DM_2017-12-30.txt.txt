Alleged clearing of forests -- Environmentalist wants matter probed
	
Environmentalist and Environmental Conservation Trust Director Sajeewa Chamikara yesterday requested President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe to appoint a Commission to probe the alleged clearing of forests by State Minister Palitha Range Bandara.
Mr. Chamikara alleged that the state minister was connected to illegal acquisition of lands that were within the Thabbowa Forest Reserve and constructing a hotel there and also clearing the Wanniyagama Forest Reserve for the purpose of setting up a large-scale commercial plantation.
He said the state minister had violated the Flora and Fauna Act, the National Environmental Act, the Wayamba Province Environmental Statute, the Irrigation Act and the State Land Ordinance by engaging in these illegal activities and therefore these matters had to be probed.
We request the President and the Prime Minister to probe the destruction of forests in the recent past Mr. Chamikara said and urged the Wildlife Conservation Department and the Coast Conservation Department to intervene and stop these activities until the matter was probed.
The state minister's denied the allegations saying they were absurd. (Thilanka Kankarathna)

Archaeology Dept. to take over Sampur Chetiya area for preservation
	
The entire land area, where the Sudaikuda Chetiya at Sampur in Trincomalee was located would be taken over by the Archaeology Department shortly for preservation, Director General of Archeology Prof. P.B. Mandawela said yesterday.
Prof. Mandawela said it was a lapse on the part of the Government as there was no plan to conserve, historical, religious and archaeology sites in the North East until 2015, though the civil war ended in 2015.
The destruction caused to the ancient Chetiya at Sampur was detected during a survey conducted by the Archeology Department in its project carried out to identify religious and archaeology sites in the East, he said.
The Chetiya and its surrounding area had been destroyed before the Department declared it as an archaeologically and historically important site, he said.
Further survey and excavations would be carried out after the Archeology Department took over the site, as it has been established that the Sampur Chetiya, is an ancient and historically important site. The Police are conducting investigations to apprehend those who are responsible for the destructions, he said.
In Sri Lanka, there are nearly 250,000 sites of religiously, culturally and archaeologically important belonging to all communities and religions and the Department of Archeology was committed to protect, preserve and maintain them for the future generation, he stressed. (Sandun A Jayasekera)

IESL recognition of bachelors of technology graduates of the university for affiliate engineer membe
	

Highlights of the Chancellors address was the rapid development of the university, recognition of some of the Technology degree programmes by the IESL for Affiliate Engineer Member status and the need to conform to the standards expected by the upcoming Engineering Council for Engineering Practitioners.

I am pleased to be able to present the Chancellors address for the 5th Annual Convocation ceremony of the University of Vocational Technology (UNIVOTEC) which is a unique university in Sri Lanka, established by Act of Parliament No 31 of 2008 to cater to the Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET) sector to provide a pathway to degree level higher education for those with vocational qualifications through the National Vocational Qualifications (NVQ) and also with mid-level Technological qualifications through lateral entry where there is scope to attract more people to study it.

From the inception, there were concerns as to why the university is called Vocational and Technological

From the very inception, as the Secretary of the Ministry I had to be persuasive in formulating the proposal, as the minister in charge of the subject at that time was not favourable in the establishment of such a university or any university. However, the then minister (who has again been returned to Parliament), within a short time was fully appreciative of the need of such a university and is now a great supporter of same. From the inception, there were concerns as to why the university is called Vocational and Technological. The minister in question at that time did well to convince Parliament that the university was meant for those who wanted to pursue the vocational route ie NVQ and also for the technical personnel with mid-level technological qualifications through lateral entry. At this stage I wish to remind those who still have concerns, that the worlds leading higher education institutes are the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in the US, Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) etc. Hence, standing firm on principles and convictions have paved the way for the development of this university as almost all the graduates are gainfully employed and much sought after.
The officers and staff of the university should continue to take firm and preserve the concept, after all we had four ministers in charge of higher Education with diverse opinions in the past. Above all the graduates passing out today has the biggest responsibility through industry interaction to display the high quality the industry demands and to enable the university to develop further. It is very encouraging to hear of the high calibre academic staff who are being attracted to
the university.
This reminds of my days at the University of Moratuwa which was initially run by visiting staff and in my department to start with I was the only PhD holder. With the passing of time the department of Civil Engineering now has about 35 PhD holders, nearly 20 Professors, almost all senior staff being Chartered Civil Engineers and could be classed as one of the strongest academic engineering departments in South Asia. The UNIVOTEC should strive to continue to develop to reach
such heights. 


This has been a great achievement, perhaps the first of its kind in Sri Lanka, that the Institution of Engineers, Sri Lanka (IESL) has granted a conditional Accreditation for the three degree programmes namely Building Services Technology, Manufacturing Technology and Mechatronics Technology

During the establishment of the UNIVOTEC, needs studies have indicated that the industry requires competent Engineering Technologists with a degree and if necessary with subsequent specialization in a particular field of a minimum one year post graduate qualification. It should be realized that for academic staff recruitment in universities and / or for research, academic requirements could be achieved through an additional postgraduate degree in the relevant field or with professional qualifications.  During the past, the university has been able to develop 13 degree programmes. Some of these programmes have been subject to evaluation by the Institution of Engineers Sri Lanka (IESL), which is the authorised Professional Body for Accreditation for Washington Accord and Sydney Accord status. This was done with both expatriate and local experts, who have indicated that the degrees which were evaluated would be eligible subject to certain conditions, to be considered for Affiliate Engineer member status as indicated in the IESL website under the list of Accredited Engineering Degree Programmes under the Sydney Accord as on October 6, 2017.

This has been a great achievement, perhaps the first of its kind in Sri Lanka, that the Institution of Engineers, Sri Lanka (IESL) has granted a conditional Accreditation for the three degree programmes namely Building Services Technology, Manufacturing Technology and Mechatronics Technology. As the Chancellor and a Past President of the Institution it gives me great joy to see this achievement of the university. While the industry would be largely satisfied with this category of members, for an academic career or research or very senior positions in industry, with a post graduate degree in the relevant field they could qualify and rise up to being a Chartered Engineer. With the establishment probably in a few weeks time of the Engineering Council enacted by Parliament in March 2017 after much deliberations for many years at different levels and fora, the Council is mandated to maintain standards of all Engineering Practitioners from Certificate level qualified Technicians to Engineering Diplomates right upto Chartered Engineers. This Council being a similar body to the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC), would have to ensure standards from the very start to achieve its objectives. 
The members of the academic staff of the university should also try to pursue an academic route in the Institution to obtain these
professional qualifications.
However, it is imperative that the present Graduates perform in the industry upholding the standards and competence expected, while the Academic Staff and the Officers of the University ensure that the concerns expressed and conditions imposed by the Institution of Engineers, Sri Lanka are adequately adhered to and no deviations occur.
At this stage I would like to stress that the present students, staff and graduates passing out and even decision makers not make comparisons with graduates of other conventional engineering faculties or universities in the country as the concept and objectives are different. The industry makes their assessment by competence, adaptability and attitude of the employees, There was a time when diplomates passing out with the National Diploma in Engineering Sciences (NDES) from the then TTI in Katunayake were in greater demand than engineering graduates! Since serving the nation for national development should be the first aim, followed by personal development, be pleased with your chosen career and motivate yourselves both as staff of the university and graduates passing out to develop further from what you have achieved thus far.

If not now, when If not us, who
	
Less than a third of young people express any interest in politics, according to an official survey. BBC reported that the survey has found 31% of 16 to 24-year-olds were fairly or very interested in the subject, compared with about half of those aged 55 and over. The analysis was based on research conducted by the Institute for Social and Economic Research at the University of Essex for its UK-wide Understanding Society survey. When it comes to Sri Lanka, maybe the figures are different, yet the situation remains the same. 
It is not surprising that the Sri Lankan youth and Sri Lankan politics are a heady mixture. Although the common saying goes todays youth are tomorrows leaders, it is a disastrous situation that majority of Sri Lankan youth are not interested in politics, Former Head of the Department of Sociology at the University of Colombo Prof. Siri Hettige said. He pointed to a faulty political system and lack of trust towards politicians as being among the main reasons for such apathy towards politics of the youth. 
A youth independent organization named rohana that was founded in Moratuwa is organizing a public debate featuring mayoral candidates from the main political parties contesting for the Moratuwa Municipal Council at the forthcoming local government elections. The event Moratu Maha Wdhaya is scheduled to be held on January 27, 2018 at the Weerapuranappu Grounds in Moratuwa. 
The event is expected to be a landmark event for the people of Moratuwa as this is the very first public political debate where they would be able to watch live debates featuring promising mayoral candidates and even to hypothetically select a candidate in advance. 
As a step towards diminishing the ignorance about the most essential and necessary administrative knowledge, rohana will distribute a hand book comprising of fundamental information regarding a Local Authority to the public on how to get their rights fulfilled and demand services from a Local Authority. 
This is a very timely event. A majority of Sri Lankan youth just float around with their eyes focussed solely on their mobile phones without showing any interest in politics. They are not aware of the massive environmental destruction happening in the country right now. They are not aware that the economy of this country is down. They should be brought down to earth. Organizers of this event are doing an impressive job to organise what could be a pilot project that others could make use of in the future, he said.  The rohana organization leads with the quote by the 35th U.S. President John F. Kennedy If not now, when If not us, who.

India aims for law that could jail Muslim men for Triple Talaq
	

REUTERS, 29th DECEMBER, 2017- Indias lower house of parliament passed a bill on Thursday aimed at prosecuting Muslim men who divorce their wives through the triple talaq, or instant divorce.
The bill now moves to the upper house of parliament, where it is likely to be approved.
In August, the Supreme Court ruled as unconstitutional a law which allows Muslim men to divorce their wives simply by uttering the word talaq, which means divorce in Arabic, three times.
Muslim women had petitioned the court, arguing the practice of husbands divorcing them through triple talaq not only violated their rights but left many women destitute.
Only a law can explicitly ban triple talaq, we have to enforce legal procedures to provide for allowances and protect custody of children, said Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad.
The bill would make the practice a non-bailable offense with a possible three-year jail term.
Muslims are the biggest religious minority in Hindu-majority India and relations between the communities have sometimes been strained since Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Hindu-nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party won the 2014 election.

Lebanese foreign minister denounced over Israel comments
	

REUTERS, 29th DECEMBER, 2017
Lebanese politicians on Thursday criticized Foreign Minister Gebran Bassil over a television interview in which he was shown saying that Lebanon did not have an ideological problem with Israel and was not against it having security.
The comments, made to al-Mayadin television channel during a long interview on Tuesday, had just started attracting attention.
Lebanon has no official relations with Israel and tensions have risen this year between Israel and Lebanons Hezbollah group. Israel and Hezbollah, the group it describes as the greatest security threat on its border, have fought wars against each other.
A former government minister called on Bassil to resign and a member of parliament also
criticized him.
Bassils office later said al-Mayadin had distorted his comments through its editing of the interview, without explaining how.
We are not against Israel living in security, he was shown saying in a clip that circulated widely in Lebanon on social media.

Next party leader will be an educated, intelligent youth: President
	
President Maithripala Sirisena said yesterday he would hand over the leadership of the SLFP not to a member of his family but to an educated and intelligent youth who engaged in clean, decent and corruption-free politics.
He said nepotism, corruption, thuggery and misrule had harmed the country and the party and therefore he was determined to build a new political culture and nurture a new breed of politicians untainted by corruption and wrongdoings.
At a meeting held at the Sugathadasa Indoor Stadium, the President told 7,000 UPFA and SLFP candidates will contest the February 10 LG polls under the betel leaf or hand symbol -- that a corruption-free political culture and a new generation of decent politicians would be born on February 11 and that he and the party was fully committed to achieving this objective.
Going down memory lane he said he participated in the SLFPs youth convention in 1982 as the President of the partys youth front under former Prime Minister Sirimavo Bandaranaike.
In 1982, I never had the faintest dream that some day in the future, I will be addressing you as the President of this country and as the head of the SLFP, the President said.
"This is a vision to hold before you because you are the ones who must take over the leadership of this country and the SLFP. To do that you need to be educated, intelligent, bold and fully committed to desist from corruption, thuggery, misrule or misdeeds. The UPFA and the SLFP will never tolerate corrupt politics or corrupt politicians. We will begin cleaning up the local administration after LG polls, he said.
He said he hoped to see a set of young politicians who read books, newspapers and engaged in intelligent debates.
"When this new breed of young and clean politicians take over the administration at the grassroots level, the results will influence provincial and national level politics," the President said.
He asked the candidates not to insult or pick up fights with other party candidates during their election campaign.
You explain your development programmes to voters. You tell them how you are going to resolve their problems and how you will resolve their day to day issues. Never engage in character assassination. You must act as parents, sibling or friend of the voter, the President said.
He said some people ask what the government did during the past two and half years.
"Certain media institutions fabricated news to fit their agendas. When Russia suspended our tea imports to that country, our detractors were jubilant saying it is the end of our tea industry and is the result of the friendly relations with the global community, the President said. I rang up Russian President Vladimir Putin and requested him to lift the ban and he responded in positive and friendly manner and it was lifted in two weeks. There is a shortage of urea fertilizer these days. I spoke to Pakistan Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi requesting his help. He spoke to me a few hours ago and said he will be sending a consignment of 40,000 metric tons of Urea to Sri Lanka immediately. That is the result of our foreign policy."
He said clean politics and clean politicians would never be defeated and that the SLFP and the UPFA would be victorious and pave the way for 2020 general elections and the 2021 presidential election.
UPFA General Secretary, Minister, Mahinda Amaraweera, SLFP General Secretary, Minister Duminda Dissanayaka and Minister S.B. Dissanayaka also addressed the candidates. (Sndun A Jayasekera)

Politicos may cross over; not people - MR
	
While claiming that it was unavoidable to stop the political party members crossing over, former President Mahinda Rajapaksa said that many of these members would be standing against the Government.
Addressing the media following an event held in Colombo on Thursday, former President Rajapaksa said that several members were leaving their party since they were unable to get what they had expected.
It cannot be stopped. However, many of them would stand against the Government. One or two members attached to these political parties may cross over. But people would not do so, he added.
He said it was crystal clear that a huge gap had now been created between the anti-Government and pro-Government political parties.
He also said that there was a clear gap in between them and added that it would continue.
It is up to people to understand this situation. People are being oppressed with the high cost of living and the Government is in an attempt to divide the country.
The use of drugs has also increased, he added. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)

Thousands of Peruvians marched on Thursday to protest the presidents recent pardoning of former authoritarian leader Alberto Fujimori, calling for new general elections as a graft scandal ensnares established politicians.
The demonstrations capped a head-spinning week in which President Pedro Pablo Kuczysnki warned about a new rise of Fujimoris authoritarian movement, only to pardon him three days later after Fujimoris loyalists in Congress saved him from an impeachment bid.
Waving Peruvian flags and chanting down with the corrupt, protesters called the pardon payback for keeping Kuczynski in power.

Twelve dead in New York City apartment fire
	

Investigators in New York City searched early on Friday for the cause of a blaze that ripped through an apartment building in the borough of the Bronx, killing 12 people including an infant, in the citys deadliest fire in at least a quarter of a century.
The fire broke out a little before 7 p.m. on the first floor of a brick building and quickly spread upstairs, city Fire Commissioner Daniel Nigro told a news conference with Mayor Bill de Blasio. The cause was under investigation.
Were here at the scene of an unspeakable tragedy. In the middle of the holiday season is a time when families are together. Tonight, here in the Bronx, there are families that have been torn apart, de Blasio said. Four people were in hospital in critical condition fighting for their lives, the mayor said. Authorities said firefighters rescued 12 people from the building.
People died on various floors of the apartment, ranging in age from 1 to over 50, Nigro told reporters. In a department that is surely no stranger to tragedy, were shocked by the lives lost.
Two of the dead were found in a bathtub, according to cable news station NY1.
People were screaming and thats how we knew there was trouble, eyewitness Kimberly Wilkins told WCBS-TV, an affiliate of CBS News. People were screaming, Fire. Help. Fire. Help.
