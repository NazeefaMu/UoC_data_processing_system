A strange estrangement
	

The former strongman recently attended a wedding held in the Gampaha area. The host was a provincial politico.

It seems that it is the former strongmans usual practice to have in tow the partys area organizer whenever he attends any function public or private in any part of the country. In this instance, he had attended the wedding along with Sarana, Pohottuwa organizer in the area.
Meanwhile, Pohottuwa district leader hailing from the political cum cricketing family in Gamapaha had felt slighted when he heard that the former strongman had attended the wedding along with Sarana bypassing him. So, he had decided not to have any contact with the former strongman for some time just to demonstrate his displeasure for failing to call on him while visiting his district.
The former strongman has not so far reacted to the cold shoulder being given by his partys Gampaha stalwart, they say.

A strange lucky turn saved his day
	

The Diyawanna council the other day took up for debate a motion related to the countrys trade relations presented by a Green party purohita in yahapalanaya.

At the very start of the debate, the JO members insisted that the motion be put to a vote after the debate given the proposals possible far reaching impact on the countrys economy.
The purohita concerned remained in the chamber throughout the sitting on the day of the debate. However, it was obvious from the conduct of the Green backbenchers that they were not interested in backing the motion.
And their non-co-operative attitude became more conspicuous when they made themselves scarce by the time the vote on it was due to be taken.
However, by a strange turn of luck, the JO members who insisted on a vote in the morning had later agreed to the adoption of the motion without calling for a division.
If the JO insisted on a vote on the motion, the purohita concerned would have suffered loss of face for the defeat of the motion was a cinch, they say.

Artist Avanti completes difficult mission
	
An oil colour painting depicting the manner in which King Sri Wickrama Rajasinghe ordered Devendra Mulachari to build the Octagon or Pathirippuwa was presented to Diyawadana Nilame Pradeep Nilanga Dela by Avanti Sri Nissanka Karunaratne. 
The book The Great Royal Artificer of the Kandyan Kingdom was authored by one of the former Commissioners of the Inland Revenue Department D.D.M.Waidyasekera. 
Avanti said that her grandfather was H.Sri Nissanka and that her father was Dr. Gemunu Karunartne. She said that they were both painters. She said that there was a twenty foot extraordinary painting which hung under the great Dome and painted by Karl Kassman. The painting was of Gautama Buddha wearing a wonderful ochre coloured robe and descending from the heavens of Thusitha to Mount Meru. She said that she had grown up with this painting at  Yamuna mandir, the home of her grandfather. 
Contributions by teachers
She said that she had set aside much time for painting while being educated at Mahamaya Girls College. She attended this school from age three till she reached her seventeenth birthday. She said that she had never won any prize for art, but added that her art teacher was at this presentation. Her art teacher was Mrs. Niyangoda, who taught her to draw faces and dancers. 
Avanti said that while she was studying in New Zealand, she had the opportunity to converse with various teachers. She said that she had decided to take time out and have a formal training in art. She had her training at Michael Angelo Academy in Florence, Italy. She rates the time spent at this institute as an exciting and invigorating time in her life. She received training in renaissance art. She also learned how to draw and paint portraits and figures. She also says that this was a unique period in her life. Later she had the opportunity of learning at the famous Art Students League of New York and participated in a collaborative Art exhibition with the Tunisian artist Hechmi Chacem.
She added that a friend of hers, Senaka Weeraratne, was very much instrumental in guiding her as to how she should attend to this task of painting
After her training she returned to Sri Lanka. She said that one day a friend had visited her and inquired as to what she was doing That was the time she had just opened a studio, which contained all her paintings. She said that a friend had opened an hotel and there were paintings of all sorts. Then she had decided to showcase her skills horned through the experiences gained by painting and training, she received in Florence. 
Kandyan period
Then she came into contact with the former Commissioner D.D.M.Waidyasekera. He had only given her a small description of the appearance and bearing of Devendra Mulachari. She added that a friend of hers, Senaka Weeraratne, was very much instrumental in guiding her as to how she should attend to this task of painting, which was to showcase the most valuable piece of Architecture during the Kandyan period. The picture related to the last King of Kandy in his youth and the brilliant designer and great architect of several icons. According to her Weeraratne had said drawing a landmark event in terms of painting was a form of a celebration through art.
The original suggestion to construct a Paththiruppuwa was for the king to have a view of the city. The king used this to see various displays of sports and martial arts. This idea to build the Paththiruppuwa came from Dhigama Nilame Ratemahatmaya of Yatinuwara. The conversation between the King and Dehigama Nilame is documented in the book. Reputed artificer during that time Devendra Mulachari was entrusted with the task of constructing this building. Devendra is supposed to have initially built a model using plantain tree stems. The King had been satisfied and the task of constructing the Paththiruppuwa was entrusted to him.
Devendras are said to have had their roots in India. According to the professor they were from Andhra Pradesh and had settled down in the South of Sri Lanka in Angulmaduwa and Devundara.

Company that got Norochcholai Power plant tender paid US $ 20 mn as commission
	
A sum of US $ 20 million has been obtained as commissions from a foreign company involved in the construction of the Norochcholai Power plant, State Minister of Power and Renewable Energy Ajith P. Perera told Parliament yesterday.
State Minister Perera made this revelation in response to an oral question raised by government MP Nalin Bandara in the House last afternoon. He said that there was evidence to say that certain irregularities had taken place when constructing the power plant,  the State Minister said.
State Minister Perera also revealed that there had been irregularities pertaining to tenders to supply coal from 2010 to 2015. He said a contract had been awarded to a company named Nobel Resource Limited for the supply of coal to the CEB without tenders being called. The State Minister said a sum of US Dollars 366. 353 million had been paid to this company for supplying 4,585, 670 metric tonnes of coal without a tender procedure.

He said that the operation of the Norochcholai Coal Power plant was interrupted for 24 days as the company failed to supply coal on time. The time duration was from September 28, 2011 to October 23, 2011. The loss to the government by this shipment delay was Rs. 3500 million. He pointed out that a further Rs. 12,500 million loss had been recorded for the same reasons during years 2014-2015 as well. (Yohan Perera and Ajith Siriwardana)

Cussedness of a bureaucrat
	

This young Green party Diyawanna member from the gem-rich district is the chief dayakaya of a prominent Buddhist temple in his home turf. He recently summoned the Dayaka Sabha to discuss arrangements to be made about holding the temples annual perahera.

During the discussion, participants pointed out to their young Diyawanna member that the stretch of the road where the perahera was due to parade was badly broken up and the repairs had to be carried out before the perahera was to be taken out. O! Thats a very small matter. You all can rest assured that will be attended to on time, he told the Dayaka Sabha members.
The young member lost no time in phoning up a high-up of the Highway Authority to inform him of the urgency in effecting repairs to the road in his village in view of the upcoming perahera event. This job will not cost even half a million, he told the high-up. The reply he got from the high-up shocked the young Diyawanna member.
Sorry, Manthrituma, our funds have run out to the last cent! We are not able to undertake this job soon!
The young member was not prepared to take no for an answer. He immediately contacted Number One and Number Two, his party leader and reported to them about the negative reply received from the Highway Authority high-up.
Both Number One and Number Two had immediately pulled up the Highway Authority bigwig for turning down the Diyawanna members request by presenting a wrong picture.
And that worked wonders: within hours men and machinery made their appearance in the village and repair work began in earnest. They did take only three days to develop the entire stretch of the road, they say.

Extraditing Mahendran: S'pore wants SL to check on the procedure
	
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe told Parliament today that the Singapore government had asked the Sri Lankan government to make a request about the procedure to extradite Central Bank's former governor Arjun Mahendran as its laws did not allow Singapore to arrest him based on an Interpol red notice.
He said the CID had made a formal request from the Defense Secretary on April 25 because our extradition laws were under his purview.
The Prime Minister said this when responding to a question asked by Chief Opposition Whip Anura Kumara Dissanayake whether the Sri Lankan government had sought international assistance to locate and arrest Mr. Mahendran based on Interpol blue and red notices issued on April 5 and 10.
The PM said he did not know where Mahendran resided in Singapore in response to a question as to why he could not help locate Mr. Mahendran because the latter was his friend.
I knew where he lived earlier but he had changed his address several times thereafter, the Prime Minister said and added that he had lost contact with Mr. Mahendran since the presidential commission began its investigations. He used to inform me whenever he went abroad during his tenure as governor but he had not done so after he left Central Bank. The present governor of Central Bank also informed me whenever he goes abroad but I dont expect him to do the same when he leaves the post."
However, the PM informed the House that he had questioned Mahendran whether it was a correct for him to leave the country to attend a family wedding in 2016 when a probe was being carried out on the bond scam.
Responding to another question asked by Mr. Dissanayake whether he accepted that something illegal had taken place, the Prime Minister said legal action was being taken because something illegal had taken place. (Yohan Perera and Ajith Siriwardana)

Health minister to register two foreign cancer treatment vaccines
	
Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne yesterday said he was in the process of registering two new foreign cancer treatment vaccines with National Medicines Regulatory Authority (NMRA) despite the controversial Taxacad also known as Hearticad cancer treatment vaccine which is already available in Sri Lanka.
The Russian vaccine Hearticad which was brought down by the minister was rejected by the Sri Lanka College of Oncologists (SLCO) in the first quarter of last year fearing of complications as it was not commonly used around the globe.
It was also learned that Hearticad was a newly introduced vaccine when it imported to the country first.
Minister Senaratne said the decision was taken after concerning that no complications were caused to cancer patients after using the Russian made Hearticad vaccine.
The minister revealed this following an observation visit at the Matale District Hospital.
The Minister said that earlier the ministry had to bear a cost of around Rs 280,000 for one vaccine however he was able to import it for Rs 144,000 from Russia.
Minister said he had taken measures to import the said vaccine for Rs 84,000 now.
He explained that no complications had occurred to cancer patients by the Russian product, therefore, he had applied for registration of two more vaccines. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

## Title: IN THIS INTERREGNUM THINKING SRI LANKAS FUTURE
## Section: Opinion
## Date: 6 June 2018 12:00 am
IN THIS INTERREGNUM THINKING SRI LANKAS FUTURE
	
This is a sign of just how managerial and technocratic we have become; so much so that mediocre utilitarianism confuses itself with professionalism. And all of this is in place of what could be called humanism. John Ralston Saul, Voltaires Bastards
From President Sirisenas whistle-blowing State bank privatization plot speech to the surrounding social anomie, we are living through a great variety of morbid symptoms which appear in this interregnum as described in Antonio Gramscis classic passage with the opening definition the crisis consists precisely in the fact that the old is dying and the new cannot be born.
Is the post-2019 future to be a rightwing Authoritarian Populism as Stuart Hall named the Thatcher (or more broadly the Thatcher-Reagan) phenomenon Or is it to be a left-of-centre, progressive and democratic populism in which nationalism is part of the protean mix Is the patriotic populist vision of a strong State and strong leadership, to be of the centrist Putin-Erdogan variety or the rightist Trump-Netanyahu variety
Any design for a new vision for Sri Lanka should centrally and explicitly address the mounting social crisis. A front page lead of an English language newspaper (May 27) disclosed that 40% of Colombos children are malnourished. The overall malnutrition figure for most provinces is a shocking 25%-30% i.e. 2 or 3 out of every 10 persons! The report was based on a presentation on May 24 to a Parliamentary Sectoral Oversight Committee on Women and Gender and the Childrens caucus, by Dr. Thusitha Wijemanna.
The same newspaper reported on May 30 that the Global Nutrition Report (GNR) 2017, a World Health Organisation (WHO) publication, documented that in Sri Lanka Anaemia among women of reproductive age i.e. ages 15-49, had risen to 33 per cent as at 2016, when compared to lower figures of 25.7 per cent as at 2011.
Early in 2015, when the Yahapalana Government took office, a noteworthy economic conference was held in Colombo. Nobel Prize winner in Economics, Prof. Joseph Stiglitz, sat next to Prime Minister Wickremesinghe and urged that the key to optimal economic development in Sri Lanka should be regarded as the question of equity. By January 2016, Prof. Stiglitz had written a key article containing his recommendations. He has proved prophetic:
Some suggest that Sri Lanka turn to the International Monetary Fund, promising belt tightening. That would be hugely-unpopular. Too many countries have lost their economic sovereignty in IMF programmes. Besides, the IMF would almost surely tell Sri Lankan officials not that theyre spending too much, but that theyre taxing too little. (https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/sri-lanka-development-growth-by-joseph-e--stiglitz-2016-01)
So far, Stiglitz recommendations have been ignored by the UNP and its Alt-Right challengers. The vision for Sri Lanka articulated by Joe Stiglitz, the worlds most renowned economic policy intellectual, pays particular and repeated emphasis to precisely the public rather than the corporate/private: public goods, public investments, public infrastructure, public services, public transport etc. His recommendations for Sri Lanka stress the public factors and dimension rather than the private sector, the market realities or public-private partnerships:
Any design for a new vision for Sri Lanka should centrally and explicitly address the mounting social crisis
Likewise, another frequently proposed strategy, public-private partnerships, may not be as beneficial as advertised. Such partnerships usually entail the government bearing the risk, while the private sector takes the profits. Typically, the implicit cost of capital obtained in this way is very high. And while the private sector can, and frequently does, renege on its contractual obligations (through bankruptcy)  or force a renegotiation under the threat of reneging  the government cannot, especially when an international investment agreement is in place.
Heavy public investment in infrastructure, education, technology, and much else. Indeed, such investments are needed for the entire country
This gives the country the opportunity to create model cities, based on the adequate provision of public services and sound public transport and attuned to the cost of carbon and climate change.
Sri Lanka, beautiful and ideally located in the Indian Ocean, is in a position to become an economic hub for the entire region  a financial centre and a safe haven for investment in a geopolitically-turbulent part of the world. But this wont happen by relying excessively on markets or under-investing in public goods. (Stiglitz, Ibid)
Godfrey Gunatilleke is the most distinguished Sri Lankan development thinker-practitioner alive. Volume 1 of his selected essays Towards a Sri Lankan Model of Development (May 2017), contains a final chapter entitled A Vision of Sri Lanka 2025 and 2035: from High Human Development to Very High Human Development. Anybody who attempts a vision for this country should study it.
The latest vision statement for Sri Lanka rolled out at the Viyathmaga event at the Shangri-La by Gotabaya Rajapaksa is one which does not mention, one single time, any of the following keywords and core concepts: citizens/citizenry, social, public, poor (except for poor returns), poverty, inequity, unemployment, rural, peasantry, agrarian. This is by no means a centre-left, moderate or middle path policy paradigm.
What Sri Lanka needs is not to mimic, adopt or adapt a model from the US, India, China or anywhere else. What it needs, firstly, is a deep study of its own realities and development experience, and a balance sheet of the positives and negatives of each development episode/phase, with a view to combining the best practices adopted by all Sri Lankan governments hitherto. Secondly, this study must be informed by a creative application of the best development practices in other parts of the world, insofar as they are relevant.
Development is not a spectator sport, where the majority of citizens watches and cheers while corporate profits and high-rise buildings ascend, as their own quality of life declines or stagnates. The foreign policy component of the Viyathmaga sessions completely-omitted the main challenges: how do we successfully combat  not merely decry and denounce  the threat of universal jurisdiction and unilateral sanctions How do we reverse the diminution of our soft power
Sri Lankas international relations cannot be insulated from Sri Lankas nationalities question. The Tamil question was globalised decades ago and is now more globalised than ever. No serious discussion on Sri Lankas foreign policy can ignore this problem and omit the political solution we propose, which is vital in managing our relations with India -- without which we lose international space and are strategically-vulnerable.
In 2015, Sri Lanka broke with the settled traditions of its democracy and brought Right and Centre together in a coalition government with ghastly results: we inhabit a decadent, fraught, Weimar moment. Will Sri Lanka return to the successful democratic conventions and traditions that have prevailed since 1947 (including over the JVP and LTTE): the competitive alternation of centre-right and centre-left that propelled our high social welfare and sustained our pluralist democratic freedoms Or will we see post-2019, roughly the same pattern, that we did post-1977an euphoric new beginning, a great economic upswing initially, a harsh authoritarian interlude justified by calls for stability in the cause of rapid economic advancement, and a culmination in multiple conflicts, internal and external, with foreign troops on our soil
The most effective political struggle against the rightist-dominated government has been waged post-2015 by a progressive, broadly centre-left opposition. Which ideological tendency, progressive centre-left, moderatecentrist or neo-nationalist right, prevails in the broad oppositional space and as the oppositions option, will depend considerably on the SLFPs new course.

Iran to boost uranium enrichment if nuclear plan fails
	

REUTERS, 05th JUNE, 2018- Iran has begun preparations to boost its uranium enrichment capacity, its nuclear chief said on Tuesday, adding to pressure on European powers trying to save a nuclear accord with Tehran in peril after a U.S. withdrawal.
France, Britain and Germany want to salvage the 2015 deals core bargain of sanctions relief in exchange for restrictions on Tehrans atomic activities. Washington has reimposed sanctions against Tehran since quitting the deal last month, arguing Iran posed a security threat.
Iran has set out conditions to stay in the nuclear deal, including steps to safeguard trade with Tehran and guarantee Iranian oil sales. But it has also said it could resume its 20 percent uranium enrichment, which is banned under the deal.
Iran was developing infrastructure for building advanced centrifuges at its Natanz facility, Ali Akbar Salehi, director of Irans Atomic Energy Organisation said in a news conference broadcast on state television.

Johann successfully ascended the summit of Mt. Everest at 5.55 am Nepal time. The adventurer proudly unfurled the Sri Lankan flag at the summit of Mt. Everest while dedicating his successful Everest Expedition to all Sri Lankans who supported him in this arduous endeavour. The Climb Everest with Johann campaign, carried out online, allowed well-wishers to sponsor each of the more than 80,000 steps Johann would take on Mount Everest to reach the peak.
Commenting on the exhilarating achievement after his return to Sri Lanka, Johann said, I felt such a sense of deep pride for my country while flying the Sri Lankan flag at the summit. It was an indescribable feeling. My first attempt to climb Everest was a dream, but on this second attempt, the dream was even bigger  it had to happen! This time I knew what to expect  I was in better physical shape and mentally ready to take up this challenge.
He went on to add, This achievement would not have been possible but for the support I have received from all partners in this adventure. A special mention needs to be made of all those who participated in the Climb with Johann initiative, sponsoring every step I took up the mountain. This victory is yours too. I am hopeful that my achievement will inspire others to dream big and go out and achieve their dream!
This was Johanns second attempt at scaling Everest. His first attempt was in April 2016 when he and Jayanthi Kuru-Utumpala were the first Sri Lankans to attempt to summit the peak, but Johann was forced to turn back at 8,400 metres, a mere 448 metres short of reaching the summit, due to technical difficulties with his equipment, as his oxygen tank failed before he could reach the summit. Kuru-Utumpala went on to complete the climb, becoming the first Sri Lankan to scale Mt. Everest.
Johann was supported in his Everest bid by the encouragement of thousands of fellow Sri Lankans. Many of them also joined in the efforts to sponsor the costs of the expedition, which amounted to nearly USD 70,000. Fundraising the second time around proved even more difficult than the first time.
Elaborating further, Johann said, I hope to share his story of overcoming daunting challenges and never giving up on dreams with as many Sri Lankans as possible. I want nothing more than to inspire other
Sri Lankans to aim for the highest peaks in whatever field they choose! Nothing is impossible!
Now that he has fulfilled his dream of conquering Mt. Everest, the adventurer expects to steep himself in his regular, hectic schedule - with a bride to dress and style on his first day back at work!

Mindfulness and Sathi Pasala: Why in Sri Lanka Programmes conducted by Sati Pasala have bee
	
Sati means mindfulness in Pali. Its most basic and practical definition is; retaining awareness every moment, on purpose, without judgment, being in the present moment and not thinking of the past nor dreaming of the future. That is being here and now. This type of presence in the present moment allows an individual to remember what was heard or done long time ago. This ability will aid all educational endeavours, among other things. 
The programme aims at introducing a universal, non-sectarian mindfulness practice in all Sri Lankan schools, irrespective of ethnicity and religion. This programme is conducted in partnership with the Ministry of Education. The programme isnt limited to the Buddhist community, but its target population includes Tamils, Muslims, Christians and also those who are non-religious. This initiative makes Sri Lanka the first ever developing country to have introduced a non-religious approach to mindfulness at the national level. 
The founder of Sati Pasala is Ven. Uda Eriyagama Dhammajiva Maha Thera. The monk gets actively involved when leading the programmes conducted for schools and is assisted by a team of facilitators. The priest is the present abbot and chief meditation master of Meetirigala Nissarana Vanaya Forest Hermitage. 
Sati Pasala is important in many respects. It is an exceptional project in the country and its work has captured the attention of countries worldwide. 
How and why did a Buddhist monk- committed to meditation and hailing from a strict Vinaya (Discipline) tradition, belonging to a group of forest monks known for their secluded lifestyles, committed to attaining Nirvana in this very life-come out into the society with an apparently non-Buddhist approach to mindfulness 
Couldnt such a move, on the part of a forest monk, be perceived as forsaking of the ultimate goal in favour of social engagement Isnt this a watering down of the Buddhas teachings and making them fit the consumerist societys need for consumption Is this a modernist and missionary move in disguise, riding on the wave of the mindfulness thats sweeping over Western and Asian countries 
We attempt to look into the backdrop, challenges and the potential of this project and for that we interviewed the monk himself. 
Following are excerpts of the interview. 
Q How did the vision of Sati Pasala come to you, Venerable Sir
I am a product of 100% free education in Sri Lanka, Kandy, up-to post graduate level. I learned or picked the idea of mindfulness at the age of 25 plus as an undergraduate. I tried my best to practise it full-time as a forest monk in Nissarana Vanaya in Sri Lanka and at Pa<U+1E47><U+1E0D>itarama in Myanmar during the past four decades, under the guidance of masters from both these meditation monasteries. My intention is to make the younger people be aware of mindfulness, at least before they reach age 25. First the thought and vision was to share the subject of mindfulness with Sunday school children, who are Buddhist. But my original proposal was rejected at the local Sa<U+1E45>gha (monks) meeting reportedly because Sunday school children are not free. This may be due to these students having tuition classes on Sundays. Eventually I got an opportunity to put to test the same proposal with the children of the close-by Buddhist temple Sunday school. That gave rise to the idea of taking mindfulness to the nearby Government school and gradually, with the success of the initiative, we introduced it as Mindful School- Sati Pasala. This school, catering to students at the grassroots level, was established at Meetirigala Village near Nissarana Vanaya. 
Q How does a typical Sati Pasala programme unfold during the school term What do you do with the children
With this limited experience in 2016 I discussed this question with Sri Lankan expatriate families in Perth, Australia, and we refined the idea as follows: 
(1) Write a book to introduce Sati as mindfulness, as well as how to practise through sitting and walking, in day-to-day activities and with the help of mindful games. At this first phase the programme is somewhat theoretical with teaching taking place at classroom level (for both the children and the class teachers). 
(2) This must start at the grassroots level rather than coming in a top-bottom way. 
(3) Once this concludes and after receiving an invitation from a school, mindful facilitators make a visit and conduct a 90-minute session (of sitting, walking and some mindful games) with the participation of the teachers on a voluntary basis. 
(4) We must obtain the feedback from the children who participate in order to assess the impact. 
Q Could you say something about Sati Pasala Foundation, the core project team and your mindfulness facilitators How do you operate internally and during your outreach efforts
With the above-mentioned points being discussed further in Melbourne, Australia, a decision was taken to formulate a plan. 
The first stage, which comprises sessions at the classroom level where theory is taught, might continue for one year. The second stage comprises the organizing of mindful camps, conducting of mindful games and the practical sitting and walking sessions. The third stage comprises a plan to introduce this programme to the school curriculum with the help of the Education Ministry. 
Discussions back at home led us to formulate Sati Pasala Foundation. We seek the assistance from the retreat organizers, those who meditate at Nissarana Vanaya Meditation centre, locals and those who are abroad. All Mindfulness Facilitators (MFs) are regular mindfulness meditation practitioners, who possess the experience of retreat-based practice. The programme was later expanded to international level, still with volunteering being the main feature.We specially trained facilitators/teachers in Sati Pasala to work with children using a handbook containing 20 essays, which are printed in Sinhala, Tamil and English. Trained MFs visit selected schools and introduce students to mindfulness with the help of school teachers. These sessions are done as pilot projects with the consent of the Minister of Education in some chosen districts. 
According to the Buddhist conception, the underlying tendencies connected with passion (raga) and aversion (dosa) as well as ignorance (moha) and the other fetters that bind to sa<U+1E43>saric existence (sa<U+1E43>yojanas) are already present in the case of a newly born baby. These facts are applicable to even an infant which is not yet capable of conceiving and conceptualising the corresponding notions; as implied for example by one of the Buddhas discourses, the Mahamalunkya-sutta in the Majjhima-nikaya. In Buddhist terms, childhood and youth are after all relative concepts, given that we are all senior citizens of Sa<U+1E43>sara. Young children are therefore not considered as so innocentand they still need to develop and purify their minds in wholesome ways in order to become incapable of unwholesomeness. This will help them reach the zenith of human potential. 
Q What is your observation of the mental and personal development of children who have participated in the Sati Pasala training 
At first a childs attitude towards parents, specifically towards the mother, changes even at a very early stage when the second child is born to the family. This can be termed as jealousy!Thats why children, even at the age of five, say that they feel relaxed after sitting simply, despite paying little attention; something that the teacher or facilitator cannot believe! 
Q We think of how such a young and innocent child can experience mental conditions like relaxation or tension
If the child has a terminal disease or is born to parents addicted to substance use-leaving aside street children- the situation we are faced with is worse. Such situations are hard for us to comprehend. We have limited experience dealing with such sections of the society. This is because suffering is universal. 
Q May I be permitted to ask how old you are Venerable Sir What was your childhood like 
Thats an unwanted question! Anyway I am 66 years young. I am still in my childhood. Children are my teachers and facilitators who teach me rejuvenate me. Sati Pasala started that rejuvenation and accelerated the process. Please come and join us and play mindful games to remain young! 
Q What have you learned by working with the children How has their company affected your own spiritual life 
This is a common question we ask ourselves while actively engaging in the work of Sati Pasala. All volunteers, including me, accept that we are learning at the same time and learning how to receive grace from children in a graceful manner. I wish to invite you all to volunteer and hope the reader who reads this article rethinks about mindfulness!
Q How would you position the Sati Pasala approach in relation to the heated debate concerning the Buddhist versus non-Buddhist character in the contemporary mindfulness movement that exists at present How does religious identity help or else interfere with developing mindfulness, especially in a country subject to religious polarisation such as Sri Lanka 
One of the declared features in our Sati Pasala Foundation is its non-sectarian and non-religious nature in all activities. Mindfulness as such is a birth right of human beings that the Buddha acknowledged 2600 years ago. There is no doubt about that. 
In our interfaith forum of Sati Pasala all the main religious leaders and teachers in Sri Lanka accepted Sati Pasala unanimously. This is a token of its future success. They attended our Global Mindful Summit held in February 2018 in Colombo and have already shared their views. Please visit the website www.globalmindfulnesssummit.org 
The point worth highlighting here is the preventive purpose of mindfulness that we prescribe in Sati Pasala in comparison to the mindfulness practised in contemporary society. 
That is definitely a much better thing to do in a non-religiously identified context, since the idea that prevention is better than cure is held in common by all humans, and not limited to a sect. 
Im sure the world at large would follow this method of mindfulness taught by us. 
Q What does non-religious mindfulness have to offer our country Can it truly lead to reconciliation and community regeneration 
Presently were working with well-established organizations like Sarvodaya in Sri Lanka and discuss this question openly in a productive way in the presence of other religious leaders and teachers. So far, we have had a number of such meetings and conferences. So far so good. Arigatou is another international organization closely knitted with Sati Pasala and were progressing towards our goal in keeping with time. My experience is that mindfulness can be a potent unifier  a practice that, when nurtured, has the capacity to bring diverse people together, in amity with harmony. I often use the phrase: mindfulness is like a thread that can join a string of flowers resulting in a beautiful garland. 
Our hope is to introduce this practice if possible, as a positive model, under the agenda of Sustainable Development Goals to the United Nations.

Mona Lisa remark cost him portfolio he loved
	

The hero of this story is a Blue party gabby purohita hailing from the backwoods of the country. At the last general polls, he could not muster enough votes to win a seat. Nevertheless, he was lucky enough to make it to Diyawanna through the list.

A rare one who puts his gift of the gab to the best use in politics, the man would often regale his Diyawanna colleagues with witticisms and anecdotes. Some of his yarns and jokes are so funny, his colleagues would recall them for repeat enjoyment whenever they meet for a gossip session.
The man has also made a name for making witty remarks about the countrys top men in politics both in public and private.
Quite recently, our hero had made a very interesting remark about a certain bigwig in yahapalanaya. Referring to this bigwig, he had said: Macho, no one can fathom this man. His face is inscrutable. It has as many secrets hidden in it as in Mona Lisas! In fact, our politico had made that remark in lighter vein with no ill-will towards the big man. However, one of those who enjoyed this witty remark had quietly carried it to the big man.
The big man on hearing this remark conveyed with a little bit of uncomplimentary coloring added to it, had felt affronted, but had shrugged it off as if he did not mind it.
However, at the reshuffle carried out later, the purohita lost the portfolio he liked so much and was saddled with one for which there wereno takers!

MS and the 100-day-programme
	
Who would have thought President Maithripala Sirisena was not in agreement with the 100-day-programme marketed by those who toiled to see him as the President following the 2015 election This has been the case, according to the President himself, who broke the news last week. 
President Sirisena dumbfounded the entire country, perhaps including his family members, at a function held last Wednesday at the Sri Lanka Foundation to commemorate the 76th birth anniversary of the late Ven. Maduluwawe Sobitha Thera, when he questioned as to who compiled the 100-day-programme. He said with only 47 UNP MPs in Parliament, a programme was prepared in calendar form to be implemented within 100 days. He said the right thing that should have happened was to have dissolved Parliament the very next day he was sworn in.
He baffled the entire country by implying he was oblivious to the 100-day-programme. It is a well-known fact that the Presidential election campaign was purely planned and put in practice by the United National Party (UNP) leadership and therefore, there may be some truth in what the President says. The UNP might have strategized the course of action without the knowledge and consent of their common candidate, but in belief there was no reason for him to oppose it. And also the UNP, during its two tenures under Presidents of other parties, had been exercising the habit of bulldozing through the latters wishes and it might have ignored the President as he implies.
Yet, why did he wait for so long (three and a half years) to speak this truth to his countrymen It is unlikely that people would believe what he said as the programme seemed to have had his blessings and the support of the SLFP group that paralyzed former President Mahinda Rajapaksas leadership along with him, throughout the 100 days when some of the 100 points of it were implemented. The President rightly boasted on Wednesday that it was he who gave necessary Parliamentary support as head of the SLFP to give effect to the main components of the 100-day-programme such as the mini-Budget with so many concessions to the people in the first month of his administration and the 19th Amendment which was passed in Parliament in April 2015. Did he mean support was given to implement a programme which he did not agree with
The common Presidential candidate of the opposition, Maithripala Sirisena had announced on the first day of his candidature that he would appoint UNP leader Ranil Wickremesinghe as Prime Minister immediately after his election; he readily kept that promise. If he had not expected some programme  100-day or else -- to be implemented in days to come, why did he appoint a Prime Minister and board of ministers without dissolving the Parliament straightaway
One has to accept the important point he articulated about the role of the SLFP under his leadership in bringing in democratic reforms after the so-called Yahapalana Government came to power. There were 142 MPs who had accepted the leadership of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa then, and without their support no reforms could have been brought in by the UNP which had only 47 MPs. The President used his SLFP chairmanship to make his party members support those reforms. The fact that he is not only the SLFP Chairman but also the Executive President of the country might have worked towards this end.
However, his outburst points out that bickering between the UNP and the Presidents group in the government is worsening. And neither party seems to be giving in which has already adversely affected the country. They have to put up with each other for the next 18 months as the law does not allow people to replace the incumbent government with another. Hence, circumstances demand leaders from both ruling parties to act responsibly.

## Section: Hard talk
## Date: 6 June 2018 12:00 am
My task is to give new hope to all UNP members and millions of our voters
	
New General Secretary of the UNP, Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam discussed the future of the grand old party, current political situation of the country and education with the Daily Mirror in the aftermath of his appointment. The excerpts:-


No one proposed that the top leadership in the party must be changed
	There will be price drop in most of the essential commodities, utility services in near future
	Teaching staff who had served 10 years or more in national schools will be transferred
	Sajith Premadasa is a capable leader and a minister and will get his right place at the right time
	PM Ranil Wickremesinghe must be the UNPs presidential candidate at the 2019 presidential polls
Q The UNP remains in a politically enervated position right now. What is your formula to bring the party back into a winning trend
I was elected unanimous to this post in a critical and difficult time of the UNP and my prime objective is to bring back the UNP, one of the oldest and largest political parties in the country to its former glory. I believe that the task of restructuring the UNP into the winning path remains in strengthening the party in the grassroots level and attracting young voters who would be voting for the first time this year and also uniting all UNPers who hold dissenting views. I agree that the Yahapalana Government has not performed in some areas to the expectations of the masses who voted for the UNP in two elections in 2015. To ensure the UNPs victory in the forthcoming Provincial Councils, Presidential and Parliamentary polls this year and next year dwells mainly on improving the living condition of the low income families with emphasis on Samurdhi beneficiaries. Several welfare programmes that target improving the family income, subsidies, health and education facilities and of course bringing down the prices of essential commodities are on the pipeline. 
You will see that the government would go ahead with these highly ambitious welfare programmes that aim at giving relief and benefits to the people in the days to come. By saying so I must admit that the government has been extremely weak in giving due publicity or making people aware of the good work done by the Yahapalana Government during the past three years. 
It is a well known fact that the unity government inherited a totally devastated economy accompanied with a huge debt package, a suppressed media and a judiciary that remained under the thumb of the executive President. The white van culture and lawlessness were the order of the day. The global community treated Sri Lanka as a pariah state and all international financial institutions, UN agencies and democracies had sidelined Sri Lanka and there was no one we could turn for help. 
There will be no political or personal influence in this exercise and all teachers serving more than 10 years at National Schools will be transferred and vacancies will be filled by suitable teachers from other parts of the country
Therefore, we had to attend first and foremost to restore Sri Lankas good name in the global forums, win back our self respect and dignity among the global community, re-establish, democracy, rule of law, judicial independence and free media which we did in the 100-day programme. The unity government introduced the 19th Amendment, clipped the powers of the Executive, established independent commissions and created an atmosphere where any Sri Lankan could say I am a Sri Lankan citizen with pride. 
In the domestic economic front, the government increased public servants salary by Rs.10,000 which is the highest in history, private sector salary by Rs. 3,500, drastically reduced prices of nearly 20 essential commodities, fuel, gas, transport fare, electricity etc. But sadly, no one talks about these highly beneficial acts of the government but talks only on recent price hikes, bus fare and fuel price increase. 
I cannot understand as to why almost all the private media  print and electronic  have turned against the government and mercilessly attack the UNP manipulating the freedom given to them by the government. I dont mind if the media criticizes the UNP sticking to facts and truthful information. But they always dish out disinformation, misinformation, fabrication, half truth and absolute lies in attacking the UNP. This is how the free media enjoys the freedom regained by them under the Yahapalana Government. 
Sri Lankas external debt repayments totalling US$ 4 billion per year between 2019 and 2022 and the total nett external debt exceeded US$50 billion in 2017. Sri Lanka will not delay a day to pay back these debts.
Q Are you satisfied with the changes introduced to the UNP with new appointments
Yes, indeed. It was done in an extremely democratic manner stipulating to policies and laws of a political party that upholds participatory democracy. But, you are aware that it is very difficult to satisfy 100% in appointing office bearers not only in a political party but even in any other establishment. My task is to create confidence and give all UNP members and millions of our voters a new hope, a new dream and a sense of victory. I will do it, no matter how much it costs or what may be the outcome. 
Q But a considerable number of backbenches, a large number of party supporters, party membership and even several party seniors have expressed their disappointment over the failure to change the party leadership. Your comments...
At the partys Working Committee meeting held on April 26, all appointments to the party were elected uncontested. No one expressed dissenting views to the new office bearers. However, if any member is not happy about the new office bearers, he/she must raise it within the party and not with outsiders or the media. I must reiterate that there was no protest or nomination to change the party leadership or against those newly elected. 
Q All of them say whatever the position given to whomever; reforms or changes are cosmetic as long as there is no change in the top leadership of the party. How do you see this
No one wanted or proposed any dramatic changes in the top structure of the party leadership. No one proposed that the top leadership must be changed in the party. No one proposed a name for the party leadership. As such they must all unite under the present leadership and contribute their maximum to ensure the partys victory at the forthcoming PC, Presidential and Parliamentary elections. All are free to discuss any issue within the party and resolve them amicably.
Yellow Journalism is much more harmful to a country that of yellow fever. I cannot understand as to why almost all the private media  print and electronic  have turned against the government and mercilessly attack the UNP manipulating the freedom given to them by this government.
Q The widely-touted concept not only among UNPers but among many other political parties and social groups was that Sajith Premadasa is the one who could face Gotabhaya Rajapaksa or any other candidate contesting the 2020 Presidential poll, provided he was properly groomed and given all tangible support by the party sooner than later. Do you agree
A section of the UNP holds this concept, while a large majority says Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe must be the UNPs presidential candidate in late 2019. However, the UNP is a party that entertains proposals or dissenting views of any one that come with the objective of strengthening the party. We must take our decisions not in the open but within the party. The party is open for any constructive proposal because our final goal is to win the PC, Presidential and Parliamentary polls in 2019. 
We all are aware of Minister Sajith Premadasas abilities, skills and leadership qualities. He has a bright future in the UNP and I have no doubt that he will get his due place in the country and the party at the right time. 
Q How are the UNPs preparations for the six Provincial Council polls scheduled to be held this year
We have a specific plan to improve our voter base. Re-organization of the party at the grassroots level is in progress satisfactorily. The government has already allocated a massive Rs. 800 billion for an accelerated development and welfare programme with the aim of enhancing family income among low income families and provide a wide-ranging welfare package that would bring down the cost of living sharply. You will see there will be a further reduction of almost all essential commodities and utility services in the coming months. Please note that those facilities and welfare programmes will not be artificial or ad-hoc but the result of the sound economic management and prudent monetary policies that would sustain the economic progress and increase the GDP.
The party is open for any constructive proposal because our final goal is to win the PC and Presidential and Parliamentary polls in 2019
Q The Yahapalana Government has miserably failed in economic management in the last three years which was demonstrated by the ever-rising prices of all essential commodities and fast depreciation of the rupee against the dollar. The government must act fast to bring some relief to the masses. What are the strategies the UNP adopts to bring the country out of this peril before 2020
I dont agree. It is a well established fact that the legacy of this government in early 2015 was a totally shattered economy, nearly four trillion-rupee debt package and a country which had been branded by the global community as a pariah state on its human rights record, rule of law and suppression of judiciary and media. Sri Lankas external debt repayments total US$ 4 billion per year between 2019 and 2022 and the total nett external debt exceeded US$ 50 billion in 2017. Sri Lanka will not delay a single day to pay back these debts. 
The unity government has reversed this negative trend and as a result debt servicing is manageable now. The rupee continues to depreciate against the dollar on domestic and global factors. The government has been able to increase foreign reserves to a record US$ 9.3 billion and increase exports and I hope this will reflect on the rupee shortly and arrest the devaluation. 
Q Ravi Karunanayakas name became tainted with the Central Bank bond scam probe. But he still remains as the deputy leader of the UNP and it reflects badly on the party. Does the UNP hierarchy have any plan to clean the party
The UNP has already taken appropriate action against him despite the fact that he has not been charged in any court of law and/or by the Presidential Commission that probed the bond scam nor has it been ruled that he is a party to the scandal. As such, we cannot take him to the guillotine only because our political opponents demand his head for their political gains. 
The government has already allocated a massive Rs. 800 billion for an accelerated development and welfare programme with the aim of enhancing family income among low income earning families
Q One of the success stories of the Yahapalana Government is your handling of the education sector in the country. But still you have to do much to make free education truly a blessing to each and every family of the country. How are you going to find a solution to the shortage of teaching staff in the North-East and in the plantation sector which is a perennial complaint by students, parents, teachers and area politicians
I am glad that you ask me this question because the positive and people-friendly steps taken by this government have been a totally closed chapter to the media. 
Take only the Suraksha life insurance scheme we introduced in 2016 for 4.5 million students who study at government schools, private and international schools and Pirivenas. Each and every school-going student has been given an insurance policy worth Rs. 200,000 per year while the government pays the premium totally. There are instances where in remote or so-called difficult areas in the country, parents cannot afford Rs.100 to pay for a three wheeler to take their child to the hospital in the event the child falls sick. Under the Suraksha insurance scheme, a child is paid Rs.1,000 per day as long as he/she remains in hospital for treatment. For three school-going children, the insurance package is Rs. 600,000 per year. 
Assets of all families have been insured by the government enabling this government to pay enhanced compensation to victims of natural disasters as opposed to extremely meagre payments made in the past. 
The cash voucher system introduced by the Education Ministry for school uniforms has been a big success and Rs. 2.5 billion has been saved last year as the Ministry must not pay for storage facilities, packaging and cutting of cloth and transporting them to schools. With the cash voucher, parents can now purchase quality fabric of their choice for uniforms for their children with the correct length. They can now purchase 80/20 high quality fabric instead of 65/35 given as school uniform cloth in the past. 
The nutritional food pack for expectant mothers, sharp reduction of prices of 42 essential drugs, free stents for heart surgeries, free eye lenses, lifting of the Rs. 1.5 million ceiling to issue medicine for cancer patients are some of the benefits granted to the people by this government. But I would say, the best is yet to come. In the next one and-a-half years, people of the country are set to receive unprecedented relief and welfare that would improve their living standard. 
The Education Ministry has given promotions to 4,000 principals, recruited 1,190 for Sri Lanka Teachers Service and another 852 for Sri Lanka Educations Service. I have taken steps to fill vacancies in the North-East before the end of 2018 and recruit another batch for training in Technology, English, Science and Mathematics. 
No one wanted or proposed any dramatic changes in the top structure of the party leadership. No one proposed that the top leadership must be changed in the party
Q However, there are teachers more than the required cadre in many of the so-called popular or prestigious national schools. They, with right connections to high and mighty refuse to accept the transfer order from the Education Ministry. How are you going to address this issue
I have given strict orders to Ministry Secretary and Director National Schools to transfer all teachers who have served in the national schools for 10 years or more. I have information that some teachers have served at certain National Schools in their entire period of service and some more than 20 to 30 years. There will be no political or personal influence in this exercise and all teachers serving more than 10 years at National Schools will be transferred and vacancies will be filled by suitable teachers from other parts of the country.

No politics in shutting down TNL's transmitting station
	
Cabinet spokesman and Health Minister, Rajitha Senaratne said no politics was involved in the shutting down of the Polgahawela transmission station belonging to the Telshan Network (Pvt) Ltd, (TNL) and the decision was independently taken by the Telecommunication Regulatory Commission (TRC) based on its regulations.
Addressing the weekly cabinet news briefing today, he said the government expected that it would reopen sooner than later after the liscence fees were paid to the TRC.
This government has no intention of shutting down media establishments like in the past but to give them the full freedom to function independently. I believe that the TNL will start operations in the next few days, the minister said. (Sandun A Jayasekera)

Nearly 186 people had received money from Arjun Aloysius, Campaign for Free and Fair Elections (CaFFE) and Centre for Human Rights and Research Sri Lanka (CHR) Executive Director Keerthi Tennakoon said yesterday.
He said these figures might increase as more and more hidden data on the bond scam were exposed.
We have done our part in educating the people on the bond scam. Now, it is up to the officials to take necessary action and expose the details of those who have received money from Arjun Aloysius, Mr. Tennakoon said. Politicians, state officials, religious leaders, journalists and some others are included in the list. We urge those responsible to expose these names before we unearth them and release them to the people.
He said he had written to Speaker Karu Jayasuriya requesting him to obtain affidavits from the newly appointed Committee on Public Enterprises (COPE) members, to prove they had not obtained any funds from Mr. Aloysius. (Sheain Fernandopulle)

PM must help bring back Mahendran: JVP
	
JVP leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake said today Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and former president Mahinda Rajapaksa should take the responsibility to bring back to the country Central Bank's former governor Arjun Mahendran, former Sri Lanka ambassador to Russia, Udayanga Weeratunge and former Sri Lankan ambassador to US Jaliya Wickramasuriya, who were absconding after defrauding public funds.
He told parliament that Mr. Wickramasuriya and Mr. Weeratunge were relatives of the ex-president and Mr. Mahendran a confidant of the Premier.
"Mr. Mahendran was appointed as CB governor on the recommendation of the Prime Minister. He is the Premier's close confidant. So he has a personal responsibility to make an effort to bring down Mr. Mahendran without seeking international assistance," Mr. Dissanayake said.
He said Mr. Mahendran was the government authority assisting Arjun Aloysius to engage in the bond scam.
"Aloysius did not loot the CB alone. It was Mr. Mahendran who assisted him to do so," Mr. Dissanayake said.
He asked the Prime Minister whether any action had been taken to prevent Mr. Mahendran's property being sold or suspended as in the case of Jaliya Wickramasuriya and Udayanga Weeratunge. (Ajith Siriwardana and Yohan Perera)

## Title: Promise of 15 Presidential Election shattered

Promise of 15 Presidential Election shattered
	
Politicians are the same all over. They promise to build bridges even when there are no rivers.~ Nikita Khrushchev
We are fast approaching the end of the first term of this Presidency. The lofty ideals expressed so abundantly on the Maithripala Sirisena/UNP platform have come out empty. The looming end result of efforts to establish Yahapalanaya seems not only self-destructive, it looks thoroughly unworthy to a set of politicians, who have been nurtured and nursed by a culture, so steeped in corruption, nepotism and incompetence.
A nation that looked forward to a system of governance that could govern the country on the rule of law and discipline of a monastic Monk is lamenting without a ray of hope.
The 2015 Presidential Election was a referendum on the First Family
The discipline of the mind is one of the greatest gifts men could grant to himself. That discipline, even though he is not born with it, needs to be cultivated and practised by him with demonstrative dedication and without any reservation.
If that discipline is practised by politicians, who profess to know the answers to all issues and problems the country confronts, Ceylon would have been a more tolerable abode for all its citizens.
It certainly is no utopian dream to expect a nation to aspire to be led by sensible leaders with a sensible practice of sensible policies and principles. What has flown out of the window is that sensibility. An alternate sensibility has crept in. That alternate sensibility is dictating the lives and even deaths of politicos and their henchmen. That alternate sensibility was in evidence in the last decade of the Rajapaksa regime.
The so-called good managers (UNP) of the countrys economy became not only mediocre; they too were successful in attaching to themselves the badge of corruption and incompetence
But the current administration now shows that this alternate sensibility has taken hold of them as well. That taking-hold is absolute and final. As penned in my last column, that alternate sensibility is an integral part of the new culture that has set in. It is in this confused context that the performance of the current administration has to be viewed, criticized and judged. Nevertheless, while the judgment that seems to have been made by many a pundit and critic seems to be negative on balance, the verdict reached by the public at large is much harsher than the current rulers could take. Where did they fail How did they fail Or to look at a more fundamental question, was the voter-judgment given at the 2015 Presidential Elections flawed
Let us answer the third question first: Was 2015 Election-Judgment flawed The easy and obvious answer is no.
The verdict reached by a margin of 3.7% is not flawed. 3.7%, more than half a million, in the context of a total poll of 12 million votes, is no slender margin.
Although this 3.7% is no landslide by any stretch of the imagination, those who were elected after the rejection of Mahinda Rajapaksa, the incumbent, are bound to deliver on the various pledges they made on the platform during the election campaign.
The breakdown of the relationship between President Sirisena and Prime Minister Wickremesinghe is at the core of this coalition
When the answer to the third question is an emphatic no, it becomes overwhelmingly palpable that those who have replaced the Rajapaksas need to get to work on an accelerated pace and with all the strengths and energies they pretend to have.
Replacing a ruler such as Mahinda Rajapaksa was no mean task. This ruler, Mahinda Rajapaksa, had brought an excruciatingly painful war to a victorious end.
Amongst his exhibitionist development programmes are, among others, developing road infrastructure, building an airport in the jungles of Mattala, constructing a port in the far corners of the land like Hambantota and erecting a sports stadium among the wildlife in Deep South.
Where and how did the current Government fail in dealing with the central issue of delivering on the pledges made on the platform
Yet, the people rejected this leader. Why
The fundamental argument against the Rajapaksas, the First Family and its wild henchmen and women, was corruption. The grand propaganda campaign that was launched by the practitioners of this insidious fallacy of all humans-corruption and its numerous attendant repercussions- could not be portrayed by its practitioners amongst fellow countrymen as a life-enriching discipline.
Along with corruption and looting the national coffers and distributing it among the cronies of the First Family, the dangerous tendencies developed by one sibling who was purported to be handling Defence of the country, white van fear, alleged killings and sudden disappearances of journalists, callous disregard for accepted norms and traditional way of Executing Government policies, they all were defeated at the 2015 Presidential Election.
In effect, the 2015 Presidential Election was a referendum on the First Family. It was more a defeat of the corruption-ridden Rajapaksa era than a victory for the UNP-backed Maithripala Sirisena. When one comes to power as a replacement of a once-popular leader, whose policies and conduct of governance were clearly overruled by the people, his responsibility is enormous; he and his governing coalition have no time whatsoever to dillydally the machinery of Government when delivering on the promises made.
The bond between the President and Prime Minister seems to have burst asunder
This is where the writer comes to answer the first two questions in this column. Where and how did the current Government fail in dealing with the central issue of delivering on the pledges made on the platform
The current Government is a two-headed instrument; one is the United National Party (UNP) and the other, Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP). The UNP is undivided and has accepted Ranil Wickremesinghe as its one leader, whereas the SLFPs status is one of total confusion and disarray. Ninety-Five per cent (95%) of the SLFP voters voted for Mahinda Rajapaksa.
Those SLFPers who opted to join the coalition Government committed a national sin. Joining a Government merely to hang on to power with the sole aim of self-enrichment is no noble trait of a politician. That is the common denominator of all politicians, barring a select few.
The pursuit of the Rajapaksa-slaughter of our national character and wealth is no task for a politician, who promised to eradicate the nauseatingly stinking practices of the Rajapaksa Government.
Politics as a mere pursuit of power in exclusion to all other sacred practices is not only sinful, it is self-destructive. That aspect of self-destruction has already set in not only among the SLFP Ministers and MPs; it has crept into the skin of the UNP Ministers and their cohorts too.
Failure to pursue the prosecution of the wrong-doers of the last regime played a decisive part in the decision by the voters in the recently held local government elections. While the so-called Bond-Scam was a very serious blunder which was rightly portrayed by the Opposition as an outright swindle, the lack of scrupulous attention given unto it by the Prime Minister too may have had a telling effect on the psyche of the voter.
Amongst his exhibitionist development programmes are, among others, developing road infrastructure, building an airport in the jungles of Mattala, constructing a port in the far corners of the land like Hambantota and erecting a sports stadium among the wildlife in Deep South
There is no meaning to an exercise of replacing one corrupt regime by another. This is where the current administration failed so miserably at governance.
The so-called good managers (UNP) of the countrys economy became not only mediocre; they too were successful in attaching to themselves the badge of corruption and incompetence.
How they failed too is explained in the foregoing paragraphs. Although volumes could be written on these aspects of the current ruling mechanism, there is one inescapable fact that is destroying the current Government and its effects are felt at the very core of its Constitution.
The breakdown of the relationship between President Sirisena and Prime Minister Wickremesinghe is one element that is at the core of this coalition. The moment it breaks down so does the very existence of the Government. The promise of the 2015 Presidential Election was shattered when this relationship could not withstand the pressures of politics.
A new face is the only answer to the winning of the next elections
Human relationships are very complex and could be extremely agonizing when any measures are taken to resuscitate them. The bond between the President and Prime Minister seems to have burst asunder. It is in this context that the writer has been arguing in the last few columns that a new face is the only answer to the winning of the next elections. The UNP has such men in their fold. Both Sajith Premadasa and Navin Dissanayake have the name, prestige and necessary experience and in government to right this meandering boat. It had better be righted sooner than later.

Drawing inspiration from the flagship Galaxy line-up such as the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S9, the new devices feature Samsungs Infinity Display, giving users nearly 15% more display area without increasing the overall size of the device.

Saudi Arabia issues driving licences to women
	

The Hindu (DUBAI), JUNE 05 2018- Saudi Arabia on Monday issued the first driving licenses to 10 women as the kingdom prepares to lift the worlds only ban on women driving in three weeks, but the surprise move comes as a number of women who had campaigned for the right to drive are under arrest and facing charges related to their activism. 
A government statement said the 10 women who were issued licences already held driving licences from other countries, including the U.S., U.K., Lebanon and Canada. They took a brief driving test and eye exam before being issued the licences at the General Department of Traffic in the capital, Riyadh. International media were not present for the event. 
Other women across the country have been preparing for the right to drive on June 24 by taking driving courses on female-only college campuses. Some are even training to become drivers for ride hailing companies like Uber.

Secret behind the change of heart
	

There is a prominent religious dignitary well known for both his erudition and aggressive nature. He played a lead role towards ushering in yahapalanaya.

However, since of late this dignitary has become a virulent critic of a very high authority in yahapalanaya. He had even vowed in public to wage a big battle against the high authority single-handed if need be.
Amazed and disconcerted that the dignitary who had been so pally with him had suddenly turned so hostile towards him, the high authority had deployed sleuths to unearth the cause for the sudden change of heart on the part of his onetime close pal.
The high authority has now received an intelligence report highlighting the cause for the attitudinal change of the religious dignitary.
According the report, the sleuths have gathered incontrovertible evidence to say that a certain group hostile to the high authority had won the heart of the erudite dignitary by offering him a precious gift.

THE BURNING QUESTION IS WHY
	
One of our young Ministers has stated that if the Government had acted similar to Malaysian Prime Minister Dr Mahathir Mohammad, those accused of fraud and corruption would have been punished by now!!! No one has ever said a TRUER WORD!!! This column keeps asking why these decadent people have not been brought to book, but we get no answers!!! No one seems to care, neither is anyone concerned!!! The BURNING QUESTION IS WHY WHY INDEED, WHO IS AFRAID OF WHOM This Minister further says that in Sri Lanka there is a terrible reluctance, a painful slowness when applying the law to these powerful people!!! We agree that this should not be the case!!! We ask the same question as the Minister  could the ordinary man in this country if he were accused of the same wrongdoings, get away with them, as these powerful politicians and business people have done Having correctly said all this Mr Minister, why did you find it necessary to change the location of your Ministry to one which requires a colossal rental and raise a lot of questions in peoples minds
What is the purpose in participating in all the religious activities you do take part in, Mr President when the country is burning around you There is looting, burning, raping, drug peddling, and every conceivable kind of misdeed going on!!! The law remains silent, perhaps IT IS TIME THAT THE MINISTER FOR LAW AND ORDER IS CHANGED, one who has got the guts and the correct attitude to do what is right when it is required!!! So many powerful people have taken so much money from Perpetual Treasuries, how can anyone point a finger at PTL
There is no Governance in the country today!!! People do exactly what they want!!! Take a look at the private hospitals  you pay so much money to undergo surgery or be treated at one of our Private Hospitals and what happens!!! One lady at a New Hospital was told she could go home, but when they went to collect her at 5 oclock she was asked to wait, this is in spite of all her bills having been paid, they were still checking and she was finally released at 9 p.m.
THIS WAS AFTER SURGERY AT THIS PRIVATE HOSPITAL!!! The same thing happened to another patient, who had surgery in yet another Private Hospital; he too had to bear the burden of waiting till they took their time to release him!!! Dont these hospital owners themselves realize that they have NO RIGHT TO INCONVENIENCE A PATIENT THE WAY THEY DO!!! THEY HAVE NO RIGHT TO DO THAT, ESPECIALLY TO A PATIENT AFTER SURGERY!!! THATS NOT ALL THOUGH, GOD HELP YOU IF YOU GO INTO ONE OF THESE PRIVATE HELLS AND THEY KNOW YOU ARE INSURED!!!
When is this country going to be the Paradise it was, we can only wonder
YOU GO IN FOR AN ALLERGY AND YOU ARE PUT THROUGH, CAT SCANS, MRI SCANS, ECGS, THE WORKS AND YOU END UP COMING OUT WORSE THAN WHEN YOU WENT IN!!! Are there any laws governing these people Only the good Lord Knows!!!
When is this country going to be the Paradise it was, we can only wonder All the highways and the flyovers that were built, all the buildings that were restored, all the beautiful flowers that were planted, the cleanliness that was maintained!!! WHAT HAPPENED TO ALL THAT
Take a look at the Society Pages of any newspaper and what do you find The so-called High Society women boasting about what they wore, where they went, what delicious food they ate, how much they laughed, how many parties they attended and where the next venue was going to be!!! Do we ever read A SINGLE PARA ON ANY ONE OF THESE SO CALLED HIGH SOCIETY WOMEN GOING TO VISIT A HOME FOR DESTITUTE CHILDREN, DESTITUTE WOMEN ABANDONED BY THEIR FAMILIES AND SOCIETY DO WE EVER READ OF ONE, JUST ONE OF this HIGH SOCIETY OR OTHER HOSTESSES HAVING SPARED A THOUGHT TO BRIGHTEN ONE DAY, JUST ONE DAY IN THE LIFE OF A DESTITUTE CHILD WITH THE RECENT HORRENDOUS FLOODS AND THOUSANDS HOMELESS, WITH NO FOOD OR CLOTHES; DO WE SEE OR HEAR OF ONE ACT OF KINDNESS FROM THOSE WHO HAVE SO MUCH TO THOSE WHO HAVE NOTHING
As opposed to that, the General Manager of Mount Lavinia Hotel did a stupendous job in hosting mothers who were abandoned on Mothers Day, giving them a day to remember; greeting each of them with flowers, giving them all the goodies they could eat, and bringing some joy into their dreary lives with song and dance and a buffet lunch that was fit for a king!!! May God bless him for his kindness to these abandoned mothers!!!
Likewise, the Tri-Services and Police have done and are still carrying out a remarkable job in caring for all those affected by the floods!!! Special mention must be made of the IGP who has gone out of his way to see that rescue operations were being properly conducted; to look into the wants of those left destitute, to attend the funerals of the one policeman who died rescuing people and another who committed suicide and ensuring that their children were looked after!!! WE SALUTE YOU MR. JAYASUNDERA!!! MORE POWER TO YOU SIR!!!
In the midst of all this devastation, we cannot forget the two Doctors at the Karapitiya Hospital who are bravely fighting to save the lives of children affected with this new Viral Flu. We already have fourteen dead and counting!!! The tragedy is there is no room, nowhere to even keep the children so they can be treated!!! In their anxiety to do the utmost as they can for these children, these two dedicated Doctors helplessly ask why all the RICH, who travel those roads in their super luxury vehicles cannot find the time and the money to construct at least ONE WARD FOR THESE SICK HELPLESS CHILDREN!!! The dedication of these two Doctors is exemplary and hard to find and they should be acknowledged and rewarded for their incalculable humanity to these children!!!

Then and now
	
It has come to light now that Number One highly concerned over growing criticism about nepotism being rampant in yahapalanaya, had pulled up two prominent purohitas for appointing family members to high posts in establishments under their purview.
One of the purohitas thus chastised, had promptly revoked the appointment offered to his son as the head of a state corporation.
However, the other purohita had ignored the warning given by Number One and had allowed two family members of his to continue in the high posts offered to them.
Irked by the purohitas seemingly disdainful attitude, Number One had rung him up and inquired why he ignored his warning. The purohita had replied that he appointed his family members as the heads of the two state entities, as he could not find two other persons reliable enough to entrust the two highly responsible jobs.
By the way, many recall that the purohita who offered this untenable excuse was vociferous in his attacks on cronyism and nepotism practiced during the previous regime.

There's something brewing at the British Council library
	
Nafeesa Amiruddeen with Gill Caldicott, Country Director, British Council Sri Lanka
The British Council in Sri Lanka reopened its Colombo library on Saturday, 2nd June. The library will continue its legacy as Colombos favourite hive for the arts, with a brand-new tagline hinting at exciting things to come- it all happens here. The official re-opening ceremony was on Saturday and attended by media, special invitees and long standing members. The guests were entertained with an evening of music and performances.
Speaking at the re-opening, British Council Country Director Gill Caldicott said When we were revamping the library we gave serious consideration to this question- what does a library look like in todays world Its certainly evolved beyond the brick and mortar of a traditional library. She added, the British Council library is a popular venue for events catering to a more intimate crowd. We have always been happy to accommodate; and we realized over time that these events were drawing in a very interesting and diverse group of people who come here to both enjoy a performance and to meet other likeminded people as well.
Gill also hopes to see ideas coming to life in this new space- thats exactly why were embracing our new tagline it all happens here! she says.
On Sunday, the library eased the general public into its fresh, new vibe with an open day especially curated to involve all ages. While culture buffs enjoyed the day with a programme of open-mic sessions and theatre workshops, the younger attendees were as entertained with movie screenings and storytelling sessions.

Moving away from the conventional concept of a traditional library and how it operates, the addition of an instrumental area and Library Coffee Corner further echoes the new direction the British Council library is steering towards  a perfect combination of a study centre and a cultural hub.
With libraries situated in Colombo, Kandy, and Jaffna, the British Council community of members in Sri Lanka alone is now over 25,000 strong  the largest library membership in the British Council global network. In addition to easy access to over 500,000 books, magazines, DVDs, and resources, a membership card also allows for guaranteed entry to special events and activities at the library and discounts at Sarasavi, Vijitha Yapa and Chapters bookshops.
In keeping with the times, the library has also expanded its digital shelves to now include an online repertoire of over 14,000 e-journals and 119,000 ebooks, ranging in subject areas from Business and Economics to Anthropology.
It all does happen here after all.

UN calls for stronger global action against plastic pollution
	

DPA, 05th JUNE, 2018- Over 60 nations have introduced measures to reduce plastic pollution but stronger action is needed as the world is facing a plastic waste crisis, a UN report said on Tuesday.
The report released to mark World Environment Day said countries such as Rwanda, Kenya and Sri Lanka had introduced bans and levies to curb single-use plastic which includes plastic bags and styrofoam products.
The report was launched in India, the global host of World Environment Day under this years theme of Beat Plastic Pollution.
Erik Solheim, head of UN Environment said plastic waste was piling up at landfills, clogging rivers and finding its way to the oceans in huge quantities.
Our aim is to redefine the worlds relationship with plastics, Solheim said talking about the need to save the environment and oceans. What we need is a revolution. The report said only nine per cent of the nine billion tonnes of plastic ever made has been recycled. It flagged serious concern over the use of plastic - saying up to 5 trillion plastic bags were used worldwide annually.

What do stickers that dress up fruits reveal
	
For the watchful consumer, reading labels on their food items is simply an act of habit. While the containers of most food items tell you exactly what youre about to purchase, when it comes to fruits, were often left puzzled; all these fruits seem to have is a little sticker containing numbers. 
Fortunately these numerical stickers give consumers useful insight and can tell them if the fruit has been genetically modified. The sticker explains whether the fruit was grown organically or using traditional methods. These stickers containing 4 to 5 digit numbers were first introduced by supermarkets in the early nineties as a method to identify bulk produce and to make inventory control easier. Known as the Price Look Up (PLU) code, they identify produce items based on various attributes including the commodity, variety and growing methodology. The codes are assigned by the International Federation for Produce Standards (IFPS), which comprises produce associations across the world. However this coding system is voluntary and has not been made mandatory by any governing body. 
The Daily Mirror visited several supermarkets in Colombo to take a look at the varieties of fruits sold and to see if we could decipher the secret codes. We observed that only a few varieties were labelled with the PLU code such as Fuji apples imported from New Zealand and mandarins imported from Australia, labelled with the 3000-4999 range codes. Many other varieties of fruits such as pomegranates and bananas only carried stickers with their respective brands. 
Public Health Inspectors Union Secretary B. M. M. Balasooriya said that even though it is practised less in South Asian countries, it is required in many European countries as well as the United States, for retailers to abide by this labelling system. He added that genetic modifications and chemical exposure in locally produced fruits are lesser compared to imported varieties. 
Organic food starting from number 9 is available in Sri Lanka, but its difficult for consumers to detect -M. M. BalasooriyaDr. Rasanjali Hettiarachchi
Imported tangerines popularly known as dodam or narang, lemons, green apples, red apples, peaches, kiwi fruit, pears and strawberries are the most common genetically modified (GM) fruits found in the market, explained Balasooriya.
However we have observed a recent trend where imported mangoes and bananas are sold by retailers. A normal mango would weigh approximately 250g while these GM mangoes would weigh about 500 grams. The fruit is generally bigger than their average counterparts, he added. 
Reading thefine print
Even though the PLU code is a simple enough key to identify how the fruit youre about to purchase was grown, learning to read the fine print will give you the opportunity to make an informed decision about your diet. 
If there are only four numbers in the PLU, starting with 3 and 4 this means that the produce was grown conventionally or traditionally with the use of pesticides. i.e. 3000-4999 Conventionally grown is an agriculture term referring to farming systems which include the use of synthetic chemical fertilizers, pesticides, herbicides and other continual inputs and even genetically modified organisms (GMOs). Although the method sounds reassuring it doesnt mean the food is free of chemicals or GMOs. 
	If there are five numbers in the PLU code, and the number starts with 8, this tells you that the item is a genetically modified fruit or vegetable. However as PHI Balasooriya explained, though the 8 prefix (i.e 83000-84999) was once reserved to identified genetically modified produce items;
	it is rarely used by retailers. Therefore the IFPS has now reserved the 83000 series for conventionally grown items while the 84000 series will designate the correspondingorganic item. 
	If there are five numbers in the PLU code, and the number starts with 9, this tells you that the produce was grown organically and is not genetically modified. For instance an organic banana would be: 94011 
Organic food starting with the number 9 code is available in Sri Lanka, but its difficult for consumers to detect. These are imported and sold especially in supermarkets and hotels in limited quantities as they are usually very expensive, Balasooriya said. Fruits with codes starting from 3 and 4 are the main varieties sold in Colombo. This is due to the needs of the consumer. Some may just want to eat an apple while another may be interested in the nutritional value. Such a person will purchase chemical free foods even at a higher cost. In one way it boils down to awareness and affordability of food, he said. 
Unfortunately some fruits arent labelled under the international standards, making it impossible to identify how the fruit was grown, according to Balasooriya. Perhaps it is because customers will be reluctant to purchase the fruit if they have been labelled as a GM fruit, he said. There is no legal requirement in Sri Lanka to label imported fruits or vegetables in this manner. Balasooriya believes authorities have been reluctant to implement a policy to regulate such imports. There are no barriers for the import of GM fruits or vegetables. Therefore such foods are imported freely. There is no authority to regulate these imports. We as public health inspectors are willing to cooperate with such efforts. But laws and policies should be formulated first, lamented Balasooriya. 
The import of GM foods is being controlled by our authorities, but we dont advertise or raise awareness about the consumption of GM foods
For instance if a certain variety of a GM fruit is imported to Sri Lanka and a locally sourced sticker is pasted on the fruit indicating that the fruit is an organically grown \variety, there is no law to tackle such an issue. There is no responsible authority to address such scams. 
Regulation is essential. Scientific studies have linked genetically engineered foods with various illnesses, especially cancer, genetic disorders and non communicable diseases. However multinational corporations with vested interests have prevented this message being carried out to the public and have encouraged the consumption of these GM foods over a long period of time. 
Such companies focus on acquiring profit for fewer costs through GM crops. They dont have any regard for the health and well-being of the consumer. A consumer may only be capable of spending Rs. 50 for an apple. In contrast an organic fruit or vegetable may cost more than Rs.100 as these are grown free of chemical pesticides and fertiliser and requires effort, the public healthofficer explained. 
In many countries GMOs are regulated if its for local consumption. But their exports arent regulated if the market doesnt require them to. Its therefore the duty of local authorities to take these regulatory measures upon themselves. For instance, the tea exported to Russia created controversy where the quality of the islands tea exports was questioned. As a result Sri Lankan tea imports were banned by Russia. Sri Lanka too should implement strong regulations such as these. The government must implement directives as its their duty to raise awareness among citizens as well as to maintain public health and well-being, he said. 
No awarenessof GM food
The Daily Mirror approached the Director of the Nutrition Co-ordination Division of the Health Ministry, Dr. Rasanjali Hettiarachchi to inquire about awareness initiatives regarding GM foods, formulated at the Ministry level. The Director said there were no such programmes in practice at present. 
The import of GM foods is being controlled by our authorities, but we dont advertise or raise awareness about the consumption of GM foods, Dr. Hettiarachchi said. When asked whether GM fruits and vegetables being labelled similar to the sugar levels being indicated on beverages, is an idea worth deliberation, Hettiarachchi said, The Food Control Unit prevents the import of GMOs, which prevents the need for such labels, 
Meanwhile she said the Ministry is deliberating the introduction of a star grading system for the identification of healthy and unhealthy foods. Dr. Hettiarachchi believes that this move would address the lacunas in awareness among consumers.
In 2012, research on consumer attitudes towards labelling of GM foods in Sri Lanka carried out by researchers of the Peradeniya Universitys Postgraduate Institute of Agriculture concluded that most Sri Lankan consumers are unaware of GM food and the majority of them perceive GM food as risky to human health. The study didnt find a significant relationship between reading labels on food items and purchasing decisions of GM food. However many consumers rejected the purchase of GM food and a vast majority were of the view that GM food should be labelled, the research revealed.
We took to the streets of Pettah to speak to both fruit vendors and consumers and inquired about trade patterns and purchasing habits. One vendor in Pettah said that the fruit is restocked on a daily basis by a fruit dealer in Hokandara. When asked about the stickers with the PLU code, he said only apples imported from the US sport these stickers. We observed another variety of apples from New Zealand which had only the brand name while mandarins sold at this stall had no stickers. 


Im simply a salesman hereRajendran from Grandpass
Rajendran from Grandpass works at a fruit stall in Pettah. He said that the stall he works in is one among several owned by a reputed fruit vendor in Pettah. The owner of this stall has
been vending fruits for over 40 years in Pettah. The fruits are restocked daily from suppliers such as Sunil Traders and Nawagiri Fresh Fruits, Rajendran said. Asked if he has any knowledge of the nutritional value of the fruits he sells, he said he does not know much. Im simply a salesman here. The operation is run by the store owners and we know nothing beyond the sale of fruit. On a good day we make a profit of about Rs. 50,000 as many commuters and travellers boarding the buses or trains from Pettah prefer to buy fruits as snacks, he said.
We dont know about these thingsNirosha from Badulla
Nirosha from Badulla prefers to include fruits in her diet on a regular basis. However when asked if she is aware of the nutritional quality of the fruits she buys, she said she usually doesnt pay attention to this aspect. Nirosha was carrying a bagful of imported grapes in a container with a PLU sticker which she purchased from a fruit stall in Pettah. We asked her if she preferred to inquire from the vendors of the quality of the fruit and if she was aware of GM fruits. We dont know about these things, so we dont bother to inquire, Nirosha said.


I only check if the fruits appear tobe freshRoshan from Anuradhapura
Roshan Kumara from Anuradhapura, who had purchased a couple of apples from a vendor in Pettah, said that he didnt know that GM fruits were sold in the market. Although I purchase fruits regularly, I only check if the fruits appear to be fresh. I havent thought about its nutritional value or if it has been GM , Roshan said.


There needs to be a change in attitudes
Former Food and AgriculturalOrganisation expert
A leading advocate of organic farming with years of experience at the Food and Agriculture Organisation sounded a warning on consumers of GM foods. You can find many examples of scientific information providers such as scientists and researchers being overpowered by companies with vested interests. 65% of Americans are diabetic and yet we refer to their expertise on nutrition and dietary guidelines. Fortunately independent groups are now able to share evidence based double blinded studies, thanks to the internet. They expose the dangers of consuming GM foods and food exposed to chemicals, the expert said.

According to the source, information revealed by such studies are nothing short of frightening. Research indicates that GM BT corn can cause infertility. Years ago, natural papaya varieties were completely wiped out in Hawaii by a virus. Very soon Sri Lanka too wouldnt have endemic papaya, but the Red Lady Papaya only. Gradually the seed gene will be lost, he predicted. 
A number of health problems in Sri Lanka such as diabetes surfaced with the start of chemical farming. If we are to rectify this situation there needs to be a change in attitudes. We all must save each other from the dangers of an unhealthy diet, he opined.

3-wheel driver has tooth broken for giving his number to 'Chooti Nangi'
	
A lift given to a school-girl by a three-wheeler driver had landed him in a whole lot of trouble with her cousin and three of his pals.
The girl, who was approaching the main road from a side road was accosted by the three-wheel driver who asked if she was going to the main road. When she replied in the affirmative, he told her to get in as he was going that way. Upon getting in the 3-wheel driver began to question her about school, her home address etc. She had given him all the information he asked for. After they reached the main road she had got down and thanked him for his kindness in offering her a lift. He had reciprocated by giving her his phone number and took off after giving her a sign for her to call him.
Meanwhile, her cousin had got to know of the fact that a three-wheeler driver had offered her a lift and he had managed to get his hands on the paper with the phone number written on it. He had decided to teach this Romeo a good lesson and had hatched a plot with three of his friends to confront the man and take his revenge. He along with his friends had sent an SMS to the three-wheel driver pretending that it was sent by his cousin explaining that she wanted to meet him and naming the place where they could meet.
The 3-wheel driver swallowed the bait and arrived at the meeting spot only to be confronted by the girl's cousin and his three friends who beat him unmercifully, breaking one of his teeth in the process.
They were arrested by the Bandaragama Police.(B. S. Jayasinghe)
