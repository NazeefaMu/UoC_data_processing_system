A failed peace mission
	
?
The Northern chief purohita and his party chief from Trinco who happens to be the occupant of the main chair in the official opposition ? continue to be at loggerheads, they say.
?
The twosome had been on a course of conflict for some time. Their strained relations had taken a turn for the worse following reported moves by the opposition bigwig to install a prominent lawyer ? a new comer to Diyawanna, in a key office in the opposition.?
As this feud between the two most prominent figures in the main political party based in the North had come out into the open posing a threat to the unity of the party, a diplomat from a powerful neighboring country had come forward to play peace maker.?
The diplomat had first held talks with the opposition bigwig with a view to working out a formula for peace and had later called on the chief purohita to present the formula to him.
However, the chief purohita had reacted with anger to the proposed peace formula. ?This lawyer whom our party leader wants to elevate to high office in the opposition was once my understudy. How can I play second fiddle to him?? he had demanded angrily.
So the diplomat on the goodwill mission had to return empty-handed. ??

A fresh bid to grab the coveted chair
	
The election of the chair of the body controlling the gentlemen?s game is now a thing of the past. But indications are that some people who made an unsuccessful bid to grab the chair have not given up their cherished desire.?
?
Now they have hit upon a plan to create a situation where the incumbent will have to give up the chair by elevating the latter to the top table level. The Big Boss, falling in line with the plan by the scheming ambitious ones has already offered the incumbent a seat at the top table. Barkiss is, of course, willing, but he is said to be choosey about the subject he is to handle, they say.
The ambitious ones are looking forward to a cake walk to the chair to be vacated in the possible scenario. However, legal eagles have pointed out that a re-election should be held in case the current chair falls vacant.
The plan to acquire the coveted chair is being vigorously pursued notwithstanding the turns and twists it is taking, they say.?

The king rooster leading the cockerels is a highly dejected and disillusioned man these days, they say.
?
Quite used to power and perks as a purohita ever since his advent to national politics, the king rooster had to do without them when the yahapalanaya took office. Having realized through the brief spell of experience that the game of politics shorn of the aura of power and authority could be tough, he made overtures to the new Big Boss and the second in command and even demonstrated his support to the new regime by action in the august assembly - alas ? without a positive response so far.
Meanwhile, a rumour says that the king rooster was about to be raised to the top table when a rival from the hill country itself turned tables on him. But he is not prepared to accept defeat.
On the advice of astrologers he had a special week-long yaga-pooja conducted by several priests got down from Hyderabad in Andhra Pradesh at an estate bungalow in the Kotagala area at a cost of several millions of rupees.?
The priests have, they say, given an assurance to the king rooster that his great expectation would come to fruition within three to four weeks due to the power generated by the yaga-pooja and he is waiting for the great day with much faith and hope, they say.?

Import tax increased to control numbers
	
Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake said, at a media briefing yesterday, that there were one million three wheelers registered in the country. He said the import tax on them was increased in order to control their numbers.
With the young people, on completing of their studies, wanting to earn money by operating three wheeler taxis, there seemed to be a dearth of young people for developmental activities in the country.
Last year alone there had been 90,000 vehicles, including three wheelers, brought into the country.
Though the tax had been increased earlier, vehicle imports had increased by 55%, he said.
The importation of vehicles should be governed by a national policy and, until the road system is improved, the importation should be discouraged, he said. (Jayantha Samarakoon)

Private buses will charge extra: LPBOA
	
An extra percentage would be charged from private bus passengers taking into consideration the cost of fuel wasted due to delays caused by traffic congestion, from July 1, said Lanka Private Bus Owners' Association (LPBOA) Chairman Gemunu Wijeratne today.
He said such a decision would be taken if the government did not take action to reduce the number of private vehicles on the road.
?The recent tax increment was mainly on luxury vehicles, but no tax was imposed on small vehicles. The government also encourages the people in the country to buy vehicles with lower engine capacity,? Mr. Wijerathne said.
?The number of private vehicles on the roads is at its peak. Due to that, road traffic is increasing. Private buses have to spend more time on the road and 50 percent of the fuel is wasted. This is a huge loss for the bus owners,? he said.
?We have already informed the National Transport Commission (NTC), Transport Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva and Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayaka requesting a discussion regarding the decision. We have also informed President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe,? he said.
?As private bus operators we are responsible for 52 percent of the public transportation in the country. But the government is not giving any consideration to the private bus sector. The government is not taking any steps to develop the private bus industry,? he said.
?It has been over six months since we suggested a separate bus lane on the main roads but the government does not seem to be considering it,? he said.
?If the government does not find a way to ease the traffic congestion, the association will definitely conduct an island wide bus strike soon,? he said. (Chaturanga Pradeep)

Restrictions on issuing passports to Sri Lankans lifted
	
The Government has issued a circular yesterday ending the restrictive practice of preventing the issuance of passports to Sri Lankan citizens? resident abroad,who were compelled to leave Sri Lanka due to political persecution.
Issuing a statement, the Foreign Ministry said that the previous government issued instruction to all Sri Lankan Missions abroad in March 2011, to refrain from issuing passports to those who sought asylum due to political persecution.
?This circular constituted a serious violation of our citizen?s rights under the Constitution and under the many human rights conventions to which Sri Lanka has become a party over the years. It has also caused immense hardship and difficulties to many Sri Lankans, who were forced to leave the country as a result of their struggle against authoritarian rule,? it said.
The statement said that the Government has renewed its commitment to upholding citizen?s rights and the rule of law.
?Freedom of movement and impartial treatment of our citizens, irrespective of their political beliefs, will be secured for all our citizens. Furthermore, as a result of the good governance and reconciliation efforts of the current government, many Sri Lankans living abroad have expressed an interest in visiting and investing in Sri Lanka. Ending this restrictive practice will further enable our citizens overseas to visit and return to Sri Lanka and thereby contribute to the country?s development and reconciliation process,? it said.
?Therefore, the Government has directed the Controller-General, Department <U+200E>of Immigration and Emigration, to issue a circular ending this draconian practice and restore the procedure followed since Independence of enabling every Sri Lankan citizen living abroad to obtain a passport,? the statement said.

Switching to trousers for convenience
	
?
Most of our politicians of yesteryear who were brought up in the Western lifestyle discarded the ?tie-coat? attire for the national dress when they entered politics. The purpose was to identify themselves with the common man. Their successive generations faithfully followed the tradition set by their predecessors.
?
A rare instance where this tradition in regard to the national dress had worked in the reverse was reported the other day. That was when in a surprise move, a certain Diyawanna member from the Colombo district switched from the national dress to the Western attire.
This Diyawanna member is said to have lost a bag that contained his clothes during his recent visit to a foreign country. And he had no alternative other than to take to the Western dress. He now continues to go about garbed in the Western attire.
This talkative Diyawanna member showed up at a media briefing in his new dress. But none raised a query about his dress switch during the briefing. However, at the conclusion of the media briefing, a journo who walked up to the member had asked him in a whisper why he suddenly changed his dress.
The member had reportedly replied: ?Aney Malli! Please don?t make news out of my dress change. You know that I am engaged in flood relief work these days. So I have to often get into boats and get out of them and if I wear a sarong on these boat rides, it may easily slip down and it could be a nuisance. So these days I am going about in an old trouser and a shirt which I unearthed from my wardrobe.?
The journo had accepted his explanation with a smile and promised not to write anything about his dress change.?

It was in the Wellampitiya area that most politicos had to face a hostile reception from flood victims. ?
A chief purohita and a team member from the yahapalanaya top table who visited this area too had to face an unforgettable and embarrassing incident.?
A large crowd of flood victims had mobbed the purohita duo soon after they showed up in Wellampitiya, not in a gesture of a warm welcome but to berate them for visiting them when the worst was over. ??We were struggling mired in flood waters for several days, but you people did not care to send boats to save our lives. Our lives were saved by our own people in the area who deployed hired boats in a quick rescue operation. You visit us now having ignored us at the most critical hour,? they told the two VIPs. The two bigwigs had patiently listened to their angry comments and jibes making no move that could further provoke them. Therefore, they could leave the area without suffering any outrage. ??
However, a certain Diyawanna member who had to face a similar situation while distributing relief material in the Gampaha area had not taken kindly to the angry protests of the flood victims. ?The henchmen who accompanied the Diyawanna member had brandished their fists even at the womenfolk and a serious clash which was about to break out had been averted at the nick of time, they say.

Colombo Additional Magistrate Chandana Kalansooriya today acquitted the JVP MP Vijitha Herath from the drunken driving charge in the inquiry conducted against him over the accident that took place on May 30 in the Rajagiriya area.
The Welikada Police had filed three charges against him-reckless driving, not preventing a possible accident and drunken driving.
The Magistrate acquitted the suspect from the third charge, since it was apparently not possible to continue as a proper allegation.
However, the Additional Judicial Medical Officer, K.K. Joozar, had mentioned in his Legal Medical Examination Form that the suspect?s breath, smelled of alcohol at the time of the examination, but the JMO had not mentioned that the suspect was under the influence of alcohol.
The Magistrate considering a precedent, Sumanaratne Vs Borella OIC, stated that it was not sufficient that the ?breath, smelling of alcohol? to be regarded as ?under the influence of alcohol? to continue with the litigation under the charge of drunken driving.
After pleading guilty to the rest of the charges, the suspect was ordered to pay a Crown Cost of 1500 Rupees over the other charges, for which he was convicted by the Magistrate.
The suspect also agreed to pay Rs. 17,423 to the damaged property of Telecom post in the accident.
Mr. Herath was arrested by the Welikada Police on Monday night, and released on police bail later for crashing onto a telecom post in Rajagiriya. (Shehan Chamika Silva)

There were many politicos who tried to exploit the flood situation to gain political mileage. Here?s a story about such a worthy hailing from the Colombo district.
?
Kaduwela was one of the worst flood-hit parts in the district. ?A dandy deputy cruising in the area with a group of supporters distributing flood relief was on his way to Ranala when he felt an urge to distribute some items with his own hands. So he got his boat beached at a congenial spot at an elevated highland for this purpose. On hearing that the deputy had arrived by boat, flood victims marooned on this highland rushed to the place where the boat had beached.?
The deputy made a brief speech expressing his deep sympathies and he pulled out a bunch of ripe ?seeni? banana from a bag in the boat and began offering them one?fruit each.?
The flood victims who expected a relief pack each containing essential items for immediate use were highly disappointed and some of them were livid feeling that they were badly let down. ?They had waved off the bananas offered and made angry protests saying: ?We were entertained to Biryani feeds when you were wooing our vote. ?Now that we are utterly helpless and are starving, you come and offer us a banana each??
The deputy realizing that his oratorical skills were not good enough to pacify the crowd of flood victims growing more boisterous and hostile had the boat swung back and moved as fast as possible away?
from them.?
