A political allergy causes him a seizure!
	
	This character is a betel leaf politico presiding over the affairs of a city suburb. He is also known as a crony of the deposed strongman.
He was taken ill and was hospitalised recently. The doctor, before giving the patient an injection asked him: ?May I know whether you are allergic to anything??
The politico replied with a smile. ?I am subject to an allergic condition. But, doctor, it is a political allergy!?
The doctor looked puzzled. ?A political allergy? Can you explain how you get it??
?Okay, I will explain, doctor,? said the politico.
?The moment I hear the name of a certain political leader I suffer a seizure causing my hair to stand on their ends and my teeth to clench tight.? However, I respond to any medicine administered to me if I don?t hear that name being mentioned!?
?Okay, let me know the name,? said the doctor.
The politico looked around furtively and whispered the name into the doctor?s ear. The good doctor before giving the injection promised the politico not to mention the name of the politician and thus spared him of the feared seizure.

Asia?s banking systems less exposed to currency risks: Fitch
	
		 		 
		 
			
Fitch Ratings expects Asia?s emerging market (EM) banking systems to be better positioned, although not immune to currency risks as currency volatility increases due to rising US interest rates and the slowing regional economic growth.
In a report released yesterday, Fitch compares EM Asia?s banking systems currency risks with those of other emerging market regions. Exposures appear comfortable based on the ratio of foreign-currency denominated loans to total loans and loan to deposit ratios. Greater currency flexibility and foreign exchange reserve accumulation also help mitigate EM Asia?s exposure. However, Asia?s frontier markets such as Mongolia, Sri Lanka and Vietnam are more exposed than elsewhere in the region.
There has, however, been a build-up of corporate (or non-bank private sector) external debt and overall financial system leverage, some of which is in the form of household debt. EM Asia countries rank above the global EM average in leverage, which is now also broadly comparable with past peaks. Higher leverage and, in particular, a combination of weaker currencies and lower commodity prices will increase the vulnerability of commodity producers who borrowed in hard currency. A knock-on impact on asset quality in the domestic banking system would be likely in that scenario, with current indicators already beginning to trend upwards from cyclical lows.
That said EM Asia banking systems are generally well-positioned to absorb the risks from increased currency weakness - those with greater vulnerabilities already have lower ratings. Bank loss-absorption buffers are considered adequate for most systems to offset expected developments in key metrics.

Buddhists have the say about the Bo tree  in the way!
	
	
	An attempt made to cut down a Bo tree on the Rajagiriya ? Gotatuwa road triggered an uproar recently.
The wayside Bo tree was found to be an obstacle to the road widening project launched by the local body in the area and the Chairman, keen on the project told the engineer in charge to remove the tree.
The Buddhists in the area believing in the sanctity of Bo trees, had put up a shrine there and they reacted with anger to the news that the tree sacred to them was to be cut down.? They made representations and staged protests against the proposed ?act of sacrilege?. But the Chairman turned a deaf ear to their outcry.
Later the Buddhist devotees sought the intervention of provincial member Mariks, who lost no time in representing matters to the authorities at the Ministerial level at the centre.
And the authorities had soon after sent a missive to the Chairman countermanding his decision to cut down the Bo tree.? The concerned devotees had greeted the news that the threat to the tree was no more with collective cries of ?Sadhu?, they say.
What is news to the people in general in the area is that two Muslims had intervened to save the Bo tree, whereas the Chairman who ordered the removal of the tree is a Buddhist!

But he got no answer.
	
	
	They shy away from him in day light! The deposed strongman participated in a series of religious ceremonies held in Polonnaruwa last week under the ongoing the image refurbishing program organised by his political well-wishers.
Despite there being a few black flags flying here and there, all ceremonies organized had been held as planned.? When arrangements were being made to hold a Pinkama under this program at a leading Buddhist temple in the district, a politico at the provincial level had advised the chief monk against holding the Pinkama at the temple and suggested that venue be shifted to his party office.
Later the chief monk had arrived at the new venue carrying a Buddha statue where a large group of devotees were waiting. And the Pinkama had got underway after the participants performing the customary religious observances before the Buddha statue placed on an improvised stand.? The deposed strongman also had attended the Pinkama, but only one Diyawanna member from the province was present, they say.
Pinkama over, the deposed strongman had checked into a hotel owned by a former Deputy for the night.
A number of Diyawanna members who were conspicuous by their absence at the Pinkama are said to have called on their former boss at the hotel under the cover of the night.??????

Video: Dissolution after 20A is passed: UNP
	
The United National Party (UNP) today stressed the need to enact the 20th Amendment as soon as possible to pave the way for the dissolution of Parliament at the earliest.
UNP MP Nalin Bandara Jayamaha, who made a brief description on the situation with regard to 20th Amendment, said it would take at least one and half months to get the legislation passed in Parliament.
He therefore said the House should be dissolved in one and a half month?s time at least.
?We want to make sure that Parliament is dissolved in one and a half month?s time at least as it seems that things are uncertain on the dissolution as a whole,? he said
Mr. Bandara said it would be a difficult task to get the 20th Amendment passed in this Parliament as the government was a minority.
?The notion that it would not be possible to get the 20th Amendment passed in a new Parliament because no one would get a two-thirds majority is not valid as it is difficult to obtain such a majority in the present Parliament as well,? he said.
Elaborating on some key issues with regard to electoral reforms he said the present Parliament chambers could accommodate only around ten more MPs.
He said this issue should be taken into consideration, when deciding on the increase in the number of MPs
Mannar District Parliamentarian Hunais Farook said getting any Bill passed in the present Parliament had become a waste of time and funds as more time was spent on condolence votes.
He said Rs. 600,000 was spent for electricity in Parliament for a day, when sessions were on, and this amount was wasted, when the House could pass useful Bills. (Yohan Perera and Chaturanga Pradeep)

	There are several prominent Opposition characters, who declined to sign the No-Confidence Motion against the second in command of the government, they say.
Among them are a fair member and a male member from the former royal family.
There is, of course, a valid reason for the male member?s inability to sign the document. But the inquisitive ones could find no such obvious excuse for the fair member and this had set tongues wagging.
Some people close to the fair member say that the latter had promised to vote for the motion, though she declined to sign it. Meanwhile, some others maintain that she does not want to sour her existing cordial ties with the top brass of the government.

ICRA Lanka assigns ?[SL]A-? rating for Rs.5bn CLC debenture issue
	
		 		 
		 
			
ICRA Lanka Limited, a wholly-owned subsidiary of ICRA Ltd, a group company of Moody?s Investors Service, has assigned the [SL]A- rating with a stable outlook for the proposed senior unsecured redeemable debenture issue amounting to Rs.5? billion of Commercial Leasing and Finance Company PLC (CLC).
ICRA Lanka also has an issuer rating of [SL]A-(Stable) outstanding on CLC.
Given the significant operational and financial linkages with the holding company (Holdco; Lanka Orix Leasing Company PLC), ICRA Lanka continues to take a consolidated rating view of the Holdco and the key asset financing subsidiaries.
At group level, the rating factors in the LOLC group?s long track record and established position in the retail finance sector, professional and experienced management team and adequate risk management systems with a strong retail franchise.
The rating also derives support from the committed support and oversight from its key investor of the Holdco?ORIX Corporation of Japan (rated Baa2 with stable outlook by Moody?s), which has a 30 percent stake in the entity.
The group?s performance is largely dependent on its key financial service subsidiaries due to the modest contribution from the non-financial service subsidiaries. At group level it would be important to further improve the overall asset quality of the key financial services subsidiaries, by controlling incremental slippages and focused recovery initiatives going forward.
CLC?s liquidity profile is expected to remain comfortable, notwithstanding the gaps observed in the short-term buckets, in the recent past. The company has a good asset quality profile as compared to most peers; ability of the company to restrict incremental slippages would be a key rating sensitivity from a credit perspective.
During 9MFY2015 CLC acquired about 59 percent of BRAC Lanka Finance PLC (BRAC) directly and acquired additional 35 percent from LOLC Micro Investments Limited, a group company; thus giving CLC an ownership of 94 percent of BRAC as in December 14 and subsequently made a mandatory offer to acquire all remaining shares of BRAC.
The acquisition has not impacted the financial risk profile of the company. CLC?s capitalization levels remained strong with Regulatory Total Capital Adequacy Ratio reported at 22.5 percent (Tier-I at 25.3 percent) and gearing at 2.73 times as in December 14.
CLC?s shorter term ALM (Asset-Liability Maturity) mismatches had widened during 9MFY2015. The main reason for this is the accelerated pace of mobilizing fixed deposits (mostly shorter term). ICRA Lanka however takes note of the good renewal rates of around 60 percent of the fixed deposits and, further the proposed debenture issue is likely to temper the mismatches as business growth is expected to remain moderate in the next three to six months.

The Centre is also looking at connecting India and Sri-Lanka via a sea-bridge following the inauguration of Agartala-Dhaka bus service and signing of the Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Nepal motor vehicle agreement, Road Transport and Highways Union Minister Nitin Gadkari said on Tuesday.
The road connectivity, built across Palk Strait, could possibly a combination of a sea-bridge and underwater tunnel. The underwater tunnel will also allow movement of ships through it.
"The distance between Dhanushkodi in Rameswaram and the Sri Lankan boundary is about 23 kms. A sea-bridge would help in increasing the trans-SAARC road and transport network," said Gadkari. Dhanushkodi is situated south-east of Pamban town and around 29kms away is Talaimannar in Sri Lanka, the town closest to the Indian land border.
A proposal for providing road and rail link bridging the divide across Palk Strait has been submitted to the Asian Development Bank (ADB), for a pre-feasibility study and subsequent financing. Currently, the missing link of narrow corridor of about 23 kms is serviced through makeshift ferry service transport. "At current estimates, the project would cost us Rs.23,000 crore," Gadkari added. Along with the India -- Sri Lanka road link, the Centre is also looking to connect north-east to Thailand via Mynmar. (DNAIndia)

SL placed sixth for forced marriages in UK
	
Sri Lankans are among the top 10 immigrant families to Britain who are being forced into marriage, a study revealed.
Quoting the study, NDTV reported that Sri Lankans were placed sixth, behind Indians and Pakistanis in the UK who were forced into marriage, a crime in the country.? ?
Forced marriage had been criminalised under British law exactly one year ago today and the UK's Forced Marriage Unit (FMU) said it had handled cases involving a range of different countries including Pakistan (38.3 per cent), India (7.8 per cent), Bangladesh (7.1 per cent), Afghanistan (3 per cent), Somalia (1.6 per cent), Sri Lanka (1.1 per cent), Turkey (1.1 per cent), Iran (1 per cent) and Iraq (0.7 per cent).
"We made forced marriage a crime to better protect victims and send a clear message that this brutal practice is totally unacceptable and will not be tolerated in the UK. We also hope that criminalisation will act as a deterrent," said Karen Bradley, UK minister for preventing abuse and exploitation.
"The UK is a world-leader in the fight to stamp this out, with our Forced Marriage Unit leading efforts to combat the practice both at home and abroad," she said.
Forcing someone to marry against their will is punishable by a maximum penalty of seven years' imprisonment.
"Forced marriage is different from arranged marriage. In an arranged marriage, although the families may take a leading role in arranging the marriage, the choice of whether or not to accept the arrangement remains with the prospective spouses. It is this choice which makes an arranged marriage different from a forced marriage," the FMU said.
The law is designed to help people in Britain as well as UK nationals overseas against the devastating effects of forced marriage such as physical, psychological, emotional, financial and sexual abuse including being held unlawfully captive, assaulted and raped.
The first conviction under the new legislation took place earlier this month when a 34-year-old businessman from Wales raped and imprisoned a woman, before forcing her to marry.
The cross-government FMU provided advice or support in 1,267 cases last year.
More than one in 10 cases involved victims aged under the age of 16 and nearly a fifth of cases where age was known involved victims aged between 18 and 21.
Research by Department for Children, Schools and Families in 2009 estimated that a national prevalence of reported cases of forced marriage in England was between 5,000 and 8,000.
The criminal offence works alongside Forced Marriage Protection Orders (FMPOs), which provide a specific civil remedy to prevent forced marriage and assist victims where a marriage has already taken place.
The breach of an FMPO was made a criminal offence with a maximum penalty of five years' imprisonment and/or an unlimited fine.

	The news that a move was afoot to appoint a few more Deputies generated some excitement among the Blue Diyawanna members.
Some members who entertained hope of a deputy office at least this time round were disappointed, when they failed to get the customary call from the main secretariat.
Meanwhile, a plump and short Diyawanna member from the Puttalam District received a call from the main Secretariat.
The call was from the boss of the place himself.? ?I am pleased to appoint you as a Deputy,? the Boss told the Diyawanna member.
?Thank you very much, Sir. But I think it is too early for me to aspire to high office.? I am content to continue as an ordinary member,? was the member?s reply.
The new Big Boss, who was surprised at the member declining the offer, learnt the reason for it two days later. The member had signed a pact with another member from the same district to do a simultaneous pole-vault!
Several concerned colleagues who tried to contact the member to check whether there is any truth in the rumour already making rounds, had found that all his phones had gone dead, they say.

Opposition Leader Nimal Siripala De Silva today charged that the United National Party (UNP) and the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress (SLMC) were in a move to scuttle the passage of the 20th Amendment to the Constitution in Parliament and the two political parties issue conflicting and different statements on electoral reforms at different times.
Mr. De Silva said Opposition was determined to increase the new Parliament to 250 or 255 seats despite the UNP's stance not to increase the Parliament's composition beyond 225 seats.
Meanwhile, the draft of the 20th Amendment has been gazetted Tuesday midnight with a 237-seat Parliament under the new electoral reforms, as approved by the Cabinet last Friday.
The Opposition expects to introduce amendments including the increase of the number of seats in Parliament to 255, when the 20th Amendment is debated at the Committee Stage in Parliament.
The Opposition would consult Elections Commissioner Mahinda Deshapriya and the Electoral Sub-Committee appointed to draft the Bill, Mr. De Silva said.
The Cabinet of Ministers at the special meeting held on Friday decided to increase the number of seats to 237 with 145 from First Past the Post system, 55 from the National Proportional System and 37 from the National List.
?The UNP, while agreeing to a 237-seat Parliament at the Cabinet expresses its opposition to increase the number of seats from current 225. The SLMC meanwhile demands two ballot papers. Both parties do not want electoral reforms but elections. We are ready for elections at any time, but we must support President Sirisena to fulfil his pledges given at the Presidential Poll. That is why we want the 20th Amendment be passed before dissolution,? he said.(Sadun A. Jayasekara)
