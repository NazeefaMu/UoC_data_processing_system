GMOA Assistant Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge stated that an ambulance service, on a domestic mechanism, was effectively operated in the Northern Provincial Council based in the Kilinochchi Hospital.
The Northern Provincial Council has successful launched an ambulance service based in the Kilinochchi Hospital with 106 ambulances. It is being operated with advanced technology, and the ambulances have quick access to the patient. The proposed India-aided ambulance service could also be implemented on a national mechanism alike the ambulance service in the Northern Provincial Council, he said.

The worlds most secure phone, the Blackphone 2 was launched in Sri Lanka by Chelcey Telecom recently
The launch took place under the aegis of Minister of Telecommunication and Digital Infrastructure Harin Fernando.
The Blackphone 2, which was launched in the US only in September last year, works on enhanced Android OS, guaranteeing privacy without compromise - delivering expected usability but eliminating security risks inherent in other smartphones. 
It has a faster processor, a larger display, a multitude of next generation features, is Google Play enabled and combines Android usability with the enhanced privacy and security of Silent OS.
Stating that he has always been amazed with innovation and commending Chelcey Telecom for paving the pathway to innovation, the Minister said, Sri Lanka will soon become the first country in the world to have 100 percent coverage with LTE 4G technology, prompting the highest downloading speeds anywhere. It will also soon have total fibre optic coverage, all of which is pushing the country speedily towards becoming an IT hub for the region. 
He added that it has been proven that with 10 percent internet penetration, any country gains a GDP growth rate of 1.2 percent. Sri Lanka currently has only 26 percent smartphone penetration, a percentage we must increase fast if we are to reap the benefits on a national scale.
Addressing the media, CEO of Chelcey Telecom, Asela Waidyalankara stated that with nearly one million daily reported data threats globally, compromise of privacy is one of the biggest threats in todays mobile world. 
Businesses are constantly subject to privacy breaches, which could create extensive repercussions, putting all stakeholders at risk. Therefore, privacy now has to be part of the decision making agenda as the risk it poses is immense. The Blackphone 2 guarantees security from the start, preloaded as it is with Silent Circles own apps, all of which place you in control of your communication and the data you share.
Channel Director of Silent Circle Michael Berg added saying the seamless integration with leading MDM systems possessed by this Smartphone enables it to integrate into the business immediately so enterprises that are continuously on the go. 
The use of a multiple phones too is eliminated as the Blackphone 2 has up to four separate virtual phones on one device, securely compartmentalized. Each space can be customized to fit to individuals requirements, with access and control solely by the Blackphone user.
Chelcey Telecom is a subsidiary of Chelcey Holdings. It is a young dynamic company that plans to introduce exciting and innovative technology products to the Sri Lankan market.

Lawyers say police using faulty breathalyzers
	
Lawyers for Good Governance have complained to Government Analyst Sakuntala Tennakoon that the measures used by the Police to identify drunken drivers were not accurate.
They said sub-standard breathalyzers were used by violating the instructions of the government Analyst on quality measurements.
The lawyers said the technical specifications issued by Traffic Police ASP W.D.A. Dananjaya on July 15, 2011 was flawed, because the expiry date must be displayed on the breathalyzer. They said such expiry dates were not seen in the breathalyzers being used by the police.
They also complained that the breathalyzers used by the police could be manipulated so as to introduce alcohol if one needs to accuse an innocent person of a traffic offence..
The lawyers for Good Governance requested the Government analyst to take steps to make necessary changes so that the rule of law could be enforced in a justifiable manner. (TFT)

Probe into surgery on wrong knee
	
A three-member committee is inquiring into the incident where the doctor is alleged to have operated the left knee of a 14-year-old girl instead of operating on her problamatic right knee, officials said today.
Director General of Health Services (DGHS) Dr. Palitha Mahipala said he had appointed a three-member committee on March 2 to inquire into this tragedy.
The three-member committee headed by the Kandy General Hospital Director during its investigations will ascertain whether the doctor who performed the surgery was at fault, he added.
Meanwhile, Government Medical Officers' Association (GMOA) spokesman Dr. Naveen de Soyza said his organization had no objections to disciplinary action being taken against the doctor if found guilty.
He said the GMOA was unable to say who was responsible without a proper investigation being carried out.
We request the authorities to carry out investigations independently and transparently by taking into account the actual situation. We will request them to do justice for both parties , Dr. de Soyza said.
He said these types of incidents could occur during medical treatment because the medical procedures were based on probabilities while providing optimum care.
The girl was admitted to the Peradeniya Hospital with a swelling on her right knee but the surgical operation had been carried out on her left knee. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)

The joint opposition today requested Police Chief N.K. Illangakoon to ensure an impartial and proper investigation into the Rajagiriya accident involving a motorcycle and a vehicle belonging to Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka.
In their letter to the Police Chief, joint opposition MPs Shehan Semasinghe, Kanchana Wijesekara and D.V. Chanaka asked whether the police had launched an investigation into the accident, on February 28, in which the motorcyclist was critically injured .
We have questions about the police inspecting the CCTV footage near the location of the accident and whether the police had afforded an opportunity to those who had made statements to the police. It is the duty and the utmost responsibility of the police to take action against the offenders. The law should be equal to all and the justice should be meted out to the injured youth, the MPs said.
They said that according to reports, it was Minister Ranawaka who had been driving the vehicle at the time of the accident.
Although a driver had surrendered to the police claiming it was he who drove the vehicle at the time, the youth who had followed the vehicle had seen that it was the minister who was driving. The suspect who surrendered, was also released on bail after producing in Court, they said.
The MPs said the culprits had fled the scene without reporting the accident, driven carelessly and had failed to prevent an accident.
They said the injured motorcyclist Sandeep Sampath was in a critical condition and receiving treatment at the Colombo National Hospital.

Tinted glasses for prison vehicles for criminals safety
	
Against the backdrop of a prisoner being shot while being transported in a Black Maria to Court, Prisons Commissioner General H.M.N.C. Dhanasinghe said today his office was considering measures such as tinted glasses on the vehicles to ensure safety and security.
He said he would discuss this matter with the police on how best to adopt these moves because only specially designated vehicles were currently allowed the use of tinted glasses.
Mr. Dhanasinghe said they were also considering the possibility of reducing the number of times such criminals were being transported to and fro to prevent risking their lives during transit.
We have to transport criminals involved in serious crimes to Courts to fix dates for hearing of the cases. We hope to see the possibility of producing them in courts only for Court hearing, he said.
Mr. Dhanasinghe said they were also considering about re-establishing the special court inside prisons so that notorious criminals need not be taken outside the security of the prison walls.
Earlier there was a special court inside prisons to hear cases of criminals involved in serious crimes. We need to discuss this matter with the Judicial Services Commission, he said when asked about the precautions that needs to be taken in view of the recent shooting. (Ajith Siriwardana)
