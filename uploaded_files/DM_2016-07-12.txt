Are there two legal systems in SL : Dullas
	
While claiming that the arrest of Namal Rajapaksa was part of the political witch-hunt, UPFA MP Dullas Alahapperuma today asked whether there were two Penal Codes, Judicial systems and Police Departments in this country.
Addressing a media briefing, MP Alahapperuma said it was evident from the recent arrest of Namal Rajapaksa, that the judicial system in this country was politically biased. He also said the court should take legal steps against such political personalities.
Our attempt is not to contempt the courts decision. We are aware that the court becomes more inconvenienced than us by such circumstances. Mr. Rajapaksa appeared before the Financial Crime Investigation Division (FCID) whenever he was summoned by them. Even the other members of Rajapaksa Family did the same, he added.
He said there were many other politicians who have never been appeared before the FCID even after many times they were asked to. He also said no actions have been taken against them as they were partial to the Govt.
Meanwhile, he said there were enough evidence to prove the arrest of Namal Rajapaksa as a political witch-hunt. Because a politician who represent the Govt has hinted to the media about his arrest, even before 24 hours.
Considering this fact, we have a fair suspicion that he was arrested under whims of a politician, he added.
Commenting on the Supreme Courts order to suspend the Value Added Tax (VAT), he said the Supreme Court has given a historical verdict.
What is the legal base on the VAT It should be presented to the House at the very first stage. The Govt has not taken the Houses approval for it. That is why the Supreme Court has ordered to take the Houses approval for it through an Amendment to the Bill of Increment in the VAT by 4%, he added. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)

ComBank ATM network first in Sri Lanka to be secure  with EMV capability
	

The Commercial Bank of Ceylon has announced that it has completed the upgrade of its automated teller machine (ATM) network in Sri Lanka to EMV Chip capability, significantly enhancing security against fraud by conforming to the EMV standards of the various card brands that are accepted by the Banks ATMs.  
The Bank said every one of its 630 ATMs now accept and process transactions based on Smart Card Integrated Circuit (IC) data in addition to magnetic strip data.
Also known as chip cards, these smart cards make cloning infeasible, thereby significantly increasing the security level of the card when transacting. When ATM networks of banks become wholly smart card enabled, it becomes impossible for fraudsters to perform fraudulent transactions through cloned cards. If any frauds are perpetrated on these ATMs, the liability of such frauds will become the responsibility of the card issuing banks.
As the owner of the largest single-bank automated cash dispensing facility in Sri Lanka, Commercial Bank is committed to constantly upgrade the ATM network to enhance security and convenience for its cardholders, the Banks Assistant General Manager - Information Technology, Krishan Gamage said. The conversion of our ATM network to EMV technology is one example of this commitment.
Holders of Commercial Banks standard ATM cum Shopping Debit Cards can withdraw up to Rs 40,000 from the Banks ATMs per withdrawal. The Bank also offers customers the option of setting their own ATM withdrawal limits up to a maximum of Rs 100,000 a day, and a point-of-sale limit of up to Rs 500,000.
Underlining its capacity and reliability as well as the indispensable role it plays in the daily lives of its customers, Commercial Banks ATM network dispenses an average of Rs 1.136 billion on a normal day, and has set numerous records for cash dispensed during festive seasons. Between 1st and 14th April 2016 for example, the network dispensed Rs 21.54 billion. The only Sri Lankan bank to be ranked among the Top 1000 banks of the world for five consecutive years, Commercial Bank has won multiple awards as Sri Lankas Best Bank, Best Trade Bank, Strongest Bank, Most Respected Bank from a number of local and international institutions and publications over several years. The Bank has also been adjudged one of Sri Lankas 10 best corporate citizens by the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce for several years. Commercial Banks overseas operations encompass Bangladesh, where the Bank operates 18 outlets and Myanmar, where it has a Representative Office in Yangon. The Bank will open a fully-fledged Tier I Bank in the Republic of Maldives in 2016. The Bank also recently received a license to operate a fully owned Money Transfer Operation in Italy.

Dual citizenship certificates given to 14,000 people: Minister
	
Dual citizenship certificates have been given to 14,000 people who left the country due to various reasons, North Western Development and Cultural Affairs Minister S.B. Navinna said.
He said they had previously granted 12,000 certificates apart from the 1,700 certificates which were given yesterday.
The ceremony to hand over certificates which was organised by the Internal Affairs, Wayamba Development and Cultural Affairs Ministry and the Department of Immigration and Emigration was held at the Bandaranaike Memorial International Conference Hall (BMICH) yesterday.
The concept of issuing dual citizenship certificates was introduced in 1987 and about 45,000 certificates had been issued since then, the Minister Navinna said.
The people who were granted dual citizenship certificates are entitled to all rights in the country except contesting elections. They cannot contest any election but they can vote if their names are in the voting list, he said.
The rights for contesting elections were barred from the 19th Amendment, he said.
The new system to issue dual citizenship certificates came into place following the 2015 presidential election.
Dual citizenship certificates had been given on seven previous occasions. Since then dual citizenship certificates were given to the people who have citizenships in the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, France, Italy, Australia, Switzerland, New Zealand, Sweden and several other countries.

Govt. providing safeguard for fraudsters: CaFFE
	
While remanding Namal Rajapaksa on allegations of misappropriating Rs. 70 million worth of funds belonging to a property developer, the Government on the other hand was providing necessary environment for the construction work to proceed, the Anti-Corruption Front said today.
Addressing a media briefing, the Spokesman for the Campaign for Free and Fair Elections (CaFFE) Keerthi Tennakoon said now it was clear that the Government was not doing what it preached.
Until the Government changes its attitude on providing safeguard for fraudsters, it cannot stop spreading misinformation into society. Most of the corrupt transactions that happened in Sri Lanka, are still continuing, as they happened in the past, he said.
Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa had introduced a totally corrupt mechanism into the system and we have to live with it, Co-Convener of the Left Centre Chameera Perera said at the media briefing.
That is the way they are trying to dissolve the FCID by weakening it and that is how they are trying to protect corrupted officials, he said.
The fraudulent activities of the company had now been revealed to the country. Anyhow we have received details on continuing the construction proceedings through a UNP Cabinet Minister, he said.
This is not what we expected from a new Government. The members of the Government are trying to re-start the fraud and corrupt practices. Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe should respond to these allegations. The situation had come to a point where the Prime Minister has to resort to look inward and self-questioning, he said.
The Prime Minister should pay attention very much over the UNP Ministers, who are alleged to be involved in frauds and corruption in this Government.
We urge the good governance Government to lead by example, he said. (Chaturanga Pradeep)

HNB setting new benchmark in Private banking:  S. Nandakumar
	
Hatton National Bank (HNB) PLC is seeking to set a new benchmark in terms of customer convenience in the countrys high net worth domain.
In this interview, HNBs Head of Private Banking, S. Nandakumar, elaborates on what differentiates the banks Priority Circle from other high net worth offerings and propositions and the potential for wealth management in the country.
What differentiates HNBs Priority Circle from the other high net worth offerings available in the country at present
At HNB we saw the high net worth sector as an area with significant potential for improvement and hence moved beyond standard offerings to offer personalized advisory services, the likes of which have never before been experienced in this country.
HNBs Priority Circle adds tangible and significant value to customers  with easy access to advisory services on a range of topics from investment and wealth management to insurance plus legal, travel, real estate and others, based on Client needs. HNB will leverage on their strategic partners to offer seamless services in these areas.
Priority Circle clients can use any of the exclusive meeting rooms and lounge facilities at our Priority Circle Centres for consultations or even to meet a business client  in a refined, luxurious environment. This is in addition to airport lounge access and other standard privileges. HNB Priority Circle offering is meant to serve as a one-stop shop solution for our valued clients.
A dedicated Relationship Manager will coordinate and assist the clients in achieving their wealth management needs. 
Our other benefits are very attractive interest rates on deposits, reserved vehicle parking at Priority Circle Centres, a pre-approved World MasterCard Credit Card, and free of charge Travel Cards plus internet and mobile banking facilities, SMS alerts on credit, debit cards and Bank Account transactions, competitive rates on foreign currency issuance and a branded Priority Circle Cheque Book and Debit Card.
The benefits also extend beyond our Priority Circle Centres. Clients will have preferential services at all of our 250 branches country-wide.
HNB has placed significant emphasis on advisory services. Can you explain the rationale for this
The proposition for Priority Circle was arrived at after in-depth research and analysis  we looked at customer insights and probed their requirements and expectations. We understand that Clients in this segment are cash rich but with little time  therefore convenience is key. They are looking beyond mere banking transactions and expect their bank to understand their aspirations and needs in keeping with lifestyles.
We are confident that our personalized consultancy and advisory services, together with the bundle of other lifestyle offerings and our levels of efficiency and service will be key differentiators.
What potential does HNB see in the High Net Worth segment in Sri Lanka

JHU warns Govt against introducing Constitutional reforms
	
Jathika Hela Urumaya (JHU) today warned the Govt not to get entangled in a bush of thorns by trying to introduce Constitutional reforms which had no consensus except for electoral reforms, the only possible reform at present.
JHU National Organizer Nishantha Sri Warnasinghe said the Govt should not implement any Constitutional reforms which could pave the way for division of society despite the reforms proposed by various factions.
He said JHU would agree only on bringing in electoral reforms and that other matters relating to the division of power, unitary State and religion should not be amended at the moment.
He alleged that the Joint Opposition (JO) was spreading a false opinion in the country based on the report of the Committee on Constitutional Reforms that the Govt was going to introduce Federal State, changing National Anthem, National Flag and introduce a secular State and added that the report had only introduced some options.
Mr. Warnasinghe told a news conference that the JO's opinion was baseless because the President had clearly said in his election manifesto that he would not amend any clause in the Constitution which needed to be approved through a referendum.
The claims of the JO that the Govt was going to amend matters related to the above were baseless. They have to be approved in a referendum and get a two thirds majority in Parliament, he said.
He said the JO was making these allegations taking some negative points proposed by the Committee on Constitutional Reforms and added that the report had formulated by considering the suggestion of more than 3000 people across the country.
He said it was up to the Constitutional Council to decide whether to accept those proposals on Constitutional Reforms and said JHU does not approve all the proposals made by the Committee. (Ajith Siriwardana)

Kerala's Salafis now look for 'real Islam' in SL
	
Sri Lanka has emerged as the favourite destination of a section of Malayalee Salafis who are on the pursuit of 'real Islam' and believe that scholars in Kerala lack correct understanding of the religion.
At least three youths, who are suspected to have joined the Islamic State (IS), had told their relatives that they were going to a Hadees centre in Sri Lanka for religious studies.
The trio has been identified as Abdul Rahid Abdualla and Hafeesudheen from Kasaragod and Ezza from Palakkad. Intelligence agencies have not yet identified the Hadees centre or established that a group actually landed in Sri Lanka. But some of the youth had indeed called their families while they were there. Earlier, Yemen was the attraction for ultra-Salafis in Kerala. Three years ago, at least 12 people from Nilambur in Malappuram had gone to the Darul Hadees at Dammaj in Yemen, which Salafis refer to as the 'Lighthouse of Islam'.
Back home, the ultra Salafis had 'recreated' a true Islamic ambience at Athikkatt near Nilambur in Malappuram.Going beyond the teaching of traditional Salafis that three generations after Prophet Muhammad had a perfect understanding of Islam, they sought to imitate life in the times of the Prophet himself. They led a reclusive life, immersed in prayers and kept aloof from society. They even tried to start a goat farm to replicate life in Arabia in the 7th century.
After the fall of Darul Hadees in Dammaj, the centre in Sri Lanka became popular with the ultra Salafis. A Sri Lankan national was detained by the intelligence agencies in the state two years ago after he was found holding religious classes in Nilambur. He ( the Sri Lankan) had arrived on a tourist visa and was holding classes on Islam. We detained him and issued a quit notice.However, no case was registered against him," said an intelligence officer.
Salman, a member of the group that had gone to Dammaj in Yemen, was abducted by Houthi rebels in Yemen and released later.
Darul Hadees evicted all non-local students as per the agreement reached between the Houthis and the Yemen government.
The Dammaj Salafis in Kerala did try to establish a centre of their own at Nilambur. They even collected funds for the centre, but the idea did not materialise due to various reasons.
Members of the group that is believed to have joined the IS mentioned to their relatives that they had a Markaz (centre) where they used to gather in Kozhikode.
It is not the popular Markaz run by the Sunni member Kanthapuram A P Aboobacker Musaliyar, but a different one established by the Salafis, where they conducted secret classes on Quran.
It is not yet clear that those who left the country are the members of the Dammaj Salafis in Kerala. But there is a close link between the ideologies of the two groups. Majority of the Kasargod group have a Salafi background and have frequented the Salafi mosques in Padne in Kasargod district of Kerala. (Source: timesofindia)

A Diyawanna member currently occupied with writing a book on Government, made an unsuccessful bid to bring about reconciliation between two former party leaders now at loggerheads.

The member had recently called on a former Blue party leader at his official residence in a posh residential area in the city to obtain some information for his book. While discussing matters related to the book, the member had expressed his desire to restore goodwill between the host and the other former leader.
The proposition had highly annoyed the host who had retorted: I know a lot about the Rajas which you may not know. Remember that there are more issues involving them than those appearing on the surface now. Therefore, dont talk to me about him hereafter

Return collected VAT monies to people: GL
	
The Government should return the additional monies collected from the people following the VAT increase came into effect on May 2, the Joint Opposition today said.
The Government should come up with a mechanism to return the money since the Supreme Court has ruled that it was illegal to charge the increment without Parliament approval, Joint Oppositions G.L. Peiris said.
Addressing the weekly news conference of the Joint Oppositions Economic Research Centre, he charged that the Government had pick-pocketed the people by increasing the tax.
He said the Supreme Court order was issued preventing the Government from collecting the tax increment, based on a petition filed by MP Wimal Weerawansa in order to lessen the tax burden on people.
The Government is taking measures to re-impose hardships on the people. These are the results of the economic policies of the United National Party (UNP). Its not the principle of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) to make life of the common man miserable. Therefore, if the SLFP Ministers raise their hands in favour of tax revision, they will be tightening the grip around the common mans neck, he said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

Sri Lanka can count on China as its most sincere and reliable partner for cooperation in Sri Lankas pursuit of development, Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Lu Kang said.
Addressing the weekly news briefing on Tuesday, he said in the past two years, the two-way trade volume had grown at a double-digit rate against the sluggish background and China had become Sri Lanka's 2nd largest source of tourists.
Regardless of the changing international situation, Sino-Lanka strategic partnership will continue to move forward, he said.
Responding to a question whether the new Sri Lankan Government would take more Chinese-investment projects in the wake of Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yis visit, Kang said the two sides agreed to carry forward traditional friendship, consolidate political mutual trust, and promote practical cooperation.
He said the two countries should act upon the important opportunity to follow in the direction of jointly building the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road and drive economic development and infrastructure building of Sri Lanka's near-port areas.
This could be achieved by implementing flagship projects, including the Colombo Port City project and the Hambantota Project, to enhance Sri Lanka's capability in independent development and realising common development goals, he said.
