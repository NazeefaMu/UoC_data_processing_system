A Kind Deed
	

On Saturday, August 4, kindhearted Sulochana Sandipani, with the help a small group of friends and family, visited Parama Dharmawardanaramaya Temple in Raththanapitiya to give alms consisting of 2000 vegan cupcakes. Co-sponsored by her home business, The Vegan Kitchen as well as through private contributions, the baking took two days to complete before the cupcakes were frosted and delivered to the Bellanvilla Raja Maha Viharayas Deva Dutha Perahera which passed through the village of Raththanapitiya.

August is Happiness Happens Month!
	
What is happiness Pamela Johnson seems to have found the answers. As the Founder of the Secret Society Of Happy People, her ambition is to provide a voice for those who are happy and want to express it without others raining on their parade. August is Happiness Happens Month and every year the theme changes. This year the theme is Be The Reason Someone Smiles  which can be as easy as just smiling at people more, but if you need more convincing to flash those pearly whites, heres three reasons for you to smile.
1. Smiling is contagious. Researchers have found that it is difficult to frown when looking at someone who is smiling.
2. Smiling is linked with- reduced stress levels, increased health, endorphin levels, and lowered blood pressure.
3. Smiling does not cause wrinkles. In fact, smiling acts as a facial massage that delivers blood, endorphins, and antioxidants to the skins surface.
This August, do something nice for someone in your life. Call your mother, cook dinner for a friend or volunteer with a local organization. By putting a smile on someone elses face, it can help put a smile on yours!

Bambalapitiya Sri Vajirarama Dhamma School  steps in to centenary year :  A legacy of imparting Dham
	

As a country that was thrice visited by Gauthama Buddha, the majority of its population are Buddhists. But with colonial influences and Christian missionaries around the country, imparting Dhamma education was a challenge in itself. It was in this backdrop that the Bambalapitiya Sri Vajirarama Dhamma School was established back in 1918. The concept initiated by the Most Venerable Pelane Vajiragnana Maha Nayaka Thera was a stepping stone to inculcate a culture that appreciated the Dhamma. As such, under the patronage of illustrious chief prelates, the Dhamma School has continued its mission to produce citizens with a wholesome vocal, physical and mental conduct. Today over 3000 students attend the Dhamma School and it is equipped with a teaching staff of 120. Upon reaching its centenary year, the senior incumbents of the Temple are determined to continue their legacy forward as a pioneer institution to mould better citizens in the country. 


The need for Dhamma-based education

Speaking to the Ven. Siri Vajiraramaye Gnanasiha Thera, who was one of the past pupils of the Dhamma School said that it started at the time when Sri Lanka was still a colony of the British. During that time no government school taught Buddhism. This was one of the biggest challenges we faced. Thereafter the Ministry of Buddhist Affairs was established and it was their responsibility to look into Buddhism-related matters. Afterwards schools received syllabuses and books to teach Dhamma and have exams for the children. The difference in a Dhamma school based at a temple is that the students get to talk to the monks and experience something different to what they experience at school. It is not only the Dhamma that is being taught; they also get a chance to fine tune their character in a very positive way. 
Pubbachariya was a term used by Gauthama Buddha to describe early teachers who in most instances are our parents. In reference to this term, Ven. Gnanasiha Thera too emphasized the role of parents. Parents play a big role in teaching Buddhist principles to children, Ven. Thera said. We have learned that our mother is the best Dhamma School. This way it is easy to convince children to follow Buddhas teachings. With the guidance of His teachings, children wont get misled and it has become an urgent need to make children familiar with the Dhamma. The societal trends with the introduction of technology are not satisfactory and one solution is the Dhamma.

In todays rat race over grades, children are battling with time. Therefore the need to attend the Dhamma School isnt felt as children reach higher grades

Competitive culture

In todays rat race over grades, children are battling with time. Therefore the need to attend the Dhamma School isnt felt as children reach higher grades. With O/L and A/L exams adding much pressure, parents too are determined to choose tuition classes over the Dhamma School. Because of these tuition classes, the attendance is less in senior classes, Ven. Thirikunamale Ananda Maha Nayaka Thera said with much concern. It has become a menace today and children have too much stress. At the Dhamma School we not only teach theory but we have as many practical exercises as possible. In most instances we have observed that even though children like to come to the Dhamma School, parents are reluctant to send them. With tuition and high school exams children are being trained for a competition rather than acquiring knowledge. We are not satisfied with this trend as per our vision to impart Dhamma education to Buddhist children. Even though we started during the British rule we were able to encourage citizens to appreciate the Dhamma and impart the knowledge of moral values. Therefore in moving forward we have to continue this mission amid obstacles.


A holistic educational experience

As children reach senior grades they are conditioned to get higher marks rather than appreciate the subject. Therefore the Dhamma School does the opposite. Here children are trained to get over this competitive mind-set. We dont have competitive exams at the Dhamma School, Ven. Ananda Thera continued. There is a quarterly paper titled Viduru Pahana which we publish in an attempt help the students to fine tune their creativity. Since 1936 we have also been printing a monthly paper titled Bauddha Lamaya which translates to The Buddhist Child which is also the first childrens Dhamma-based publication. We are not happy with the fact that not even parents take an interest anymore in sending their children to the Dhamma Schools. The theme of this years Centenary translates to A generation enriched by the Dhamma, A Sri Lanka enriched by humanity. But we have observed that as people have limited knowledge about the Dhamma they do not expose as many humane traits. Through the Dhamma School we have a befriending programme where students can speak to any teacher. Today children have many problems but they dont have anybody to speak to. So our teachers are trained to listen to the children and provide assistance when in need of help. 

On Poya Days we have a separate sil campaign for students, added Ven. Meegoda Sukitha Thera who is the current principal of the Dhamma School. We are impressed by the interest among the young crowd. Here they are being taught to follow the traditions and it is a very child-friendly programme. But once again we have observed that a less number of seniors students attend this programme as well. 


The Sati Pasala concept

Mindfulness has been one of the principle teachings of the Buddha. But it is a rather challenging process on the path to understand the Dhamma. According to Buddhas teachings, the purpose of mindfulness was to end suffering. Speaking further, Ven. Gnanasiha Thera said that with the introduction of technology, children have been greatly misled. This is why we have introduced the Sati Pasala programme. It translates to the Mindful School where students are trained to think on a broader perspective. The initiators of the programme had a vision to introduce mindfulness as a wholesome life skill that will benefit students in more than just one way. They will therefore know how to communicate with teachers, family, friends and the rest of the world. Students get to listen to lectures by those who have mastered these skills. They also get to listen to Dhamma verses and be familiar with the teachings ofthe Buddha. 


The mission of the Dhamma School is to encourage citizens to observe the Eight Precepts on full-moon Poya Days, respect the Sangha, parents and teachers and sustain a simple lifestyle

Paving a bright future
The mission of the Dhamma School is to encourage citizens to observe the Eight Precepts on full-moon Poya Days, respect the Sangha, parents and teachers and sustain a simple lifestyle. It further encourages generations to possess restraint, good behaviour and a sound knowledge of the Dhamma. The students are encouraged to participate in meritorious activities, hospital service, helping the needy and other social work. Other projects undertaken by the Dhamma School include assisting Dhamma Schools in rural areas, distributing dry rations, clothes and books in such areas, annual blood donations and assisting needy patients among others. Under the supervision of its present Chief Prelate, the School has been restructured and a more efficient and an administrative setup is now in place. In order to ensure the smoothing functioning of its activities five units including administration, religious and social service, examinations and education, welfare and cultural affairs havebeen established. 


The Centenary celebration will be held on August 19, 2018 at the BMICH from 2.00pm onwards in the presence of the chief prelate of the Amarapura Sangha Sabha and President Maithripala Sirisena. The keynote speech will be delivered by the University of Sri Jayawardenapura Vice Chancellor Professor Sampath Amarathunga.

Basic allowance of CMC members to be doubled
	
On a proposal made last month by Colombo Mayor Rosy Senanayake, the Colombo Municipal Councils Standing Committee on Finance has approved a 125% increase on the basic allowance being paid to councillors, CMC member Sharmila Gonawala said yesterday.
She told Daily Mirror that the basic allowance of the 119 councillors would be increased to Rs.45 000 from the previous Rs.20 000.
It is unfair to double the basic allowance of councillors because finally it is the people who have to foot the bill through their taxes. While there are many burning issues such as dengue and garbage disposal in the Colombo Municipal limits, it is unjust to increase the allowances of councillors, she said.
Ms.Senanayake rejected these claims and said she had proposed an increase on the basic allowance of councillors by Rs.25,000 considering the issues faced by them having considered the low salaries being paid as peoples representatives.
She said in making this proposal she had considered the less privileged councillors which mainly included youth and women who were willing to work hard to improve the Colombo MC limits.
Rs. 20,000 is a small amount. A member cannot even pay his or her public transport for a month with this. It is necessary to provide these members with a sufficient allowance to be motivated to work more efficiently, Ms. Senanayake said. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)

Bus strike -- Failure says minister, a success says ACPBWA
	
The bus strike launched on last night by the All Ceylon Private Bus Workers Association (ACPBWA) against the new spot fines is a failure, Transport Minister Nimal Siripala De Silva said today.
But the ACPBWA claimed that 80 per cent of buses had stopped operating their services.
The minister told a media briefing that no one could oppose the new traffic fines once they were passed in Parliament and gazetted.
The ministry had given the stakeholders sufficient time to raise objections but several bus associations agreed with the new traffic rules, the minister said and added that an Act approved by parliament could not be changed.
The bus strike was effective to some extent only on certain routes in the Western and the Southern Provinces though it was earlier planned to cover the nine provinces, he said.
The minister said more Sri Lanka Transport Board (SLTB) buses would be deployed in the evening for the convenience of the people.
If the SLTB buses were not sufficient, we would request the Army to provide buses, he said.
Traffic fines were amended in 2005 and the recent amendment was effected after 13 years.
During the 13 years the economy developed and salaries increased. As such the traffic fines revision was fair, the minister said. Those who object to the new traffic fines want to get away from being punished after committing traffic offences. Therefore, traffic fines are reasonable and there is no need to change them."
Meanwhile, ACPBWA convener U.K. Kumararatna Renuka said 80 per cent of the private buses stopped work.
Only 20 per cent of the private buses were operated. Ten per cent were operated under the influence of bus owners and the remaining ten per cent was operated to earn their daily income. Most of the buses were operated by the bus owners, he said.
Mr. Renuka said the private buses which were operated by the owners, were not concerned about the new traffic fines and pointed out the people in nine districts, including Galle, Matara, Aluthgama and Matugama, were affected by the work stoppage.
He said they will continue with the work stoppage until the President intervenes in resolving this matter. (Chaturanga Samarawickrama)

Door still open for Malinga, insists Hathurusingha
	
Sri Lankas National Coach Chandika Hathurusingha yesterday reiterated that there was still a place in the National Team for Lasith Malinga, if the fast bowler did his part and met selection criteria.
It has been almost a year since Malinga last represented Sri Lanka in an international encounter - a T20I at home against India last September - and his omission since then has been widely discussed.
Hathurusingha however, said the door was still open and Malinga had the same opportunity that any other player had to be selected, if he played domestic cricket which was the primary criteria.
He has the same opportunity that any other cricketer has, to get into the team. If he plays in the domestic tournaments, like any other player the selectors will look at him as an option depending on the teams requirement, Hathurusingha said.
In May, after the start of the Indian Premier League (IPL), Malinga was named in the Dambulla Squad for the Super Provincial One-Day Tournament, with the selectors demanding that the player must take part in that tournament to be considered for National selection.
But the bowler instead chose to stay in India and honour his commitment with the Mumbai Indians IPL franchise who had drafted Malinga as a Bowling Mentor.
Hathurusingha, meanwhile, was encouraged by the reducing number of injuries to fast bowlers, adding that the nature of injuries in that last four months had not been severe.
The last six months weve seen a tremendous improvement in terms of injuries. We havent got any soft tissue injuries in the last four months. Thats a good sign for us, and that is down to training schedules are being managed, Hathurusingha said, adding that two of Sri Lankas premier fast bowlers who had been sidelined with injuries are due to return to action soon.
Dushmantha Chameera is expected to feature right through the upcoming SLC T20 League, while Nuwan Pradeep will be eased into action and will likely play a part at the latter stages of the tournament. Injuries to fast-bowlers will remain a concern leading into the ICC Cricket World Cup next year, Hathurusingha said, but he was also happy with how preparations for the show-piece event were going.
We know the depth in batting that we have.
The concern with (the fast) bowling is injuries and the selectors and I didnt have a full squad to select in terms of bowlers because of injuries, he said.
The spin department is still evolving and we hope we can look for different combinations.
There are still places up for grab, but overall we know the plan we have and, barring injuries, how we want to play going forward. (SMD)

Fake news on social media
	
The Education Ministry today complained to the CID about reports circulating in the social media claiming that the ministry was preparing a Cabinet Paper to cut the monthly salary of teachers during school vacations.
Media Secretary Kalpa Gunaratne said the fake news was being deliberately spread by a politically-motivated group with the intention of tarnishing the image of the Education Minister.
The teachers are highly concerned by this news which contains no truth whatsoever. Thats why we thought of complaining to the CID, he said. We got to know that some teachers trade unions are preparing to launch a strike amid the ongoing A/L examination."
Mr Gunaratne said he hoped the CID would investigate this incident and arrest the mischief makers.
Meanwhile, Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam said if there was any possibility he would consider doubling teachers' salaries but unfortunately he had no authority to do so. (Sheain Fernandopulle)

Fmr. Indian PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee dies at 93
	
Atal Bihari Vajpayee, former Indian prime minister and BJP stalwart, passed away on Thursday. He was 93.
Vajpayee was admitted to the All India Institute of Medical Sciences in June. Vajpayee, who had been ailing for long, retreated from active public life over the last decade following the deterioration of his health and remained restricted to his residence.
In a medical bulletin, AIIMS said: It is with profound grief that we inform about the sad demise of former prime minister of India, Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee at 5.05 pm on 16.08.2018.
Shri Vajpayee was admitted in AIIMS on 11.06.2018 and was stable in the last 9 weeks under the care of a team of AIIMS doctors.
Unfortunately his condition deteriorated over the last 36 hours and he was put on life support systems. Despite the best of efforts, we have lost him today.
We join the Nation in deeply mourning this great loss.
A host of leaders including Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited the BJP patriarch at AIIMS. Modi met the doctors and enquired about the well-being of Vajpayee. He also met his family members, according to an official statement.
BJP veteran L K Advani, Home Minister Rajnath Singh, BJP president Amit Shah, Congress chief Rahul Gandhi, Health Minister J P Nadda and Environment Minister Harsh Vardhan were among those who paid a visit to the ailing leader.
Born in 1924 in Gwalior, Vajpayee became the first non-Indian National Congress PM to serve a full five-year term. He was first exposed to the political sphere during the Quit India movement in 1942. Within five years since then, he became a full-time RSS Pracharak and, due to his oratory skills, he soon became the face of the Jana Sangh (which is today known as the BJP).
Vajpayee was arrested between 1975 to 1977 during the Emergency imposed by the then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi. In 1977, Vajpayee became the external affairs minister in former PM Moraji Desais Cabinet. Even in those days, he was the partys star speaker.
His first stint as Prime Minister lasted only for 16 days (from May 16-31, 1996) and then again from March 19, 1998 to May 13, 2004.
Vajpayee, whose parliamentary experience spanned over four decades, had been a Member of Parliament since 1957. He was elected to the Lok Sabha ten times, and twice to the Rajya Sabha.
In late 1998 and early 1999, ex-PM Vajpayee tried to mend differences with Pakistan by pushing for a full-scale diplomatic peace process with its neighbour. With the historic inauguration of the Delhi-Lahore bus service in February 1999, Vajpayee initiated a new peace process aimed towards permanently resolving the Kashmir dispute and other conflicts with Pakistan.
The 1999 Kargil war proved to be vital for the Vajpayee-led government. Pakistan troops infiltrated into Indias territory in Kashmir valley and captured the control of unmanned border posts in 1999.
Vajpayee took a firm stand, leading India to victory in Kargil and forcing Pakistan to withdraw their troops from Indias territory. In 2002, a US diplomat revealed that Vajpayee stood firm on Indias demand for unconditional withdrawal of Pakistani troops and his then counterpart Nawaz Sharif buckled to Washingtons diktat. In spite of the war, Vajpayee also made efforts to boost the bilateral ties with Pakistan.
A voracious reader, Vajpayee was widely known and respected for his love for poetry and as an eloquent speaker. He was conferred Padma Vibhushan in 1992 in recognition of his services to the nation. He was subsequently awarded the Bharat Ratna, Indias highest civilian award, in 2015. (The Indian Express)

Great Dramatists of yesteryear and...their invaluable contribution to our society
	
The Play is the Thing, contains more anecdotes, comments, and character portraits from and by Henry Jayasena than any article or essay written about the man. It is at once full of wit and sobriety, particularly because it is not just about the theatre, the medium through which he prospered. Full of sketches about the men and women he encountered, some friendly, others indifferent, a few antagonistic, the book harbours no anger or malice. There are very few artists, who have departed from us, whom I would do anything to meet again. Jayasena was and is one of them. For people like me, who grew up on television, he was always Sudu Seeya. And yet, there was more to him than that. More to him than even the plays he wrote and directed, certainly more to him than the biographies we associate with such artists and personalities. Nearly everyone has written on the man. I can only hope to provide a brief outline. 
If ever there was a Sinhala film which rounded up a perfect cast, that film was Gamperaliya. When I read Ediriweera Sarachchandras The Sinhalese Novel and his comments on Martin Wickramasinghes novel, I was astounded by the fidelity to the characters which the actors in the film adaptation so ably sustained. Of Nanda, for instance, Sarachchandra wrote that her most distinctive quality was the absence of a proper character. Who can claim otherwise of Punya Heendeniyas performance The same could, in all likelihood, have been said of Henry Jayasenas portrayal of Piyal, who while defeated was not a defeatist, who while accepting his status did not wish to remain in it forever. He was the classic entrepreneur, but in his character there was a subtle contradiction between the earthiness of the village and the cosmopolitanism of the town. This was captured elaborately by Wasantha Kotuwella in Bertram Nihals television adaptation of the novel, including his flair for speculation (which we do not see in Lester James Periess film), but Kotuwella, I now feel, explored this aspect to his character rather overtly. What went out of the window were the nuances of his two-sided personality, the same nuances which were so ably captured by Jayasena.

To distinguish between Tony and Henry here is to compare Dahasak Sithuvili with another film about the pain of unrequited love released at the same time, Hanthane Kathawa

Jayasenas greatest performance, given all this, was as Piyal. Lesters films, at least most of them (barring his epics), are premised on characters who reveal their emotions only at the last minute. This came out most discernibly in Gamperaliya, where Piyal, incensed at Nandas open shows of affection towards her dead husband, Jinadasa, cruelly rages at her (If it were not for my money, that man would not have been given a decent funeral!). And yet, a few moments later, he has quietened down. It was the only time in the entire story in which he lost his temper, and even then, he is never really explicit about it. He comes across more as a child hurt by the indifference of his love than as a husband questioning his wifes fidelity. In no other film of mine did my cast get together so seamlessly, Lester once told me. It is hard to disagree. 
Tony Ranasinghe, after appearing as a journalist in Getawarayo, became the epitome of youthful fragility in Delovak Athara. Like Tony, Henry was not afraid of baring his manhood if that was what it took to bring his lovers back. Unlike Tony, Henry had a definitive limit. You see him reach that limit in what I consider to be his next best performance (after Gamperaliya), as Lalith in Dahasak Sithuvili, the distraught clerk in love with a girl who may or may not have other commitments. (Jayasena, for some reason, does not talk about the film in The Play is The Thing.) Theres a sequence in Dahasak Sithuvili where he comes across some photos of the girl, Nilanthi, with the man she is allegedly going out with. Laliths obsession reaches breaking point as he imagines her (the visuals help us identify what they are) on the beach with that man, Sagara, frolicking by the waves and embracing him. Through S. M. Nizars editing, the crisscrossing between the real and the imagined makes us question which is what, and for Lalith, it is enough for him to follow, question, and persist in his love for her. 
To distinguish between Tony and Henry here is to compare Dahasak Sithuvili with another film about the pain of unrequited love released at the same time, Hanthane Kathawa. There are noticeable similarities, like the protagonist being an innocent but uninteresting idealist who believes in honest relations with the men and women he associates with, as well as sequences which have him try to win his lover through a song (in Hanthane Kathawa, Tony is rebuffed by Vijaya singing a more exuberant tune, while in Dahasak Sithuvili, Henry is rebuffed at a party by everyone in favour of that immortal classic, Sathuta Vilai). And yet, there are differences. In Hanthane Kathawa, we see Tony persistently transform his love for her into feelings of jealousy towards her other lover. In Dahasak Sithuvili, however, Henry doesnt really transform his love into jealousy; he instead channels it inward, almost destroying himself. The endings of both movies help us separate these two performances even more: Tony, having discovered his lover with Vijaya, walks down the hill, defeated, and joins his comrades; Henry, also defeated, writes a letter to her and retreats to the countryside. In other words, Tony could never articulate his frustration, whereas Henry could. Those were their respective fates: the one remain muted, the other wanted to be vocal. 
Henry did not take part in many films (only 20, compared with 120 by Tony). The few he did take part in, however, were miles away from the plays he produced. To see his performance in Gamperaliya, for instance, is to be astounded at his ability at toning down the brashness he projected in, say, Hunuwataye Kathawa (as Azadac). The same can be said of Dahasak Sithuvili and even Kaliyugaya. But surprisingly, these were not Henrys favourite performances. As a director who worked with him closely once told me, He believed that his greatest onscreen performance was as the drunken father in Handaya. Handaya, a classic for its time, had Henry play out an aggressive loudmouth wholly at odds with his characterisations of Piyal and Lalith. Perhaps, this director went on, It was the theatricality of the act which appealed to him.Lester vouched for this aspect to the man when he told me on another occasion that he was the sort of actor who had to be directed, if you know what I mean... He would open up, and we would then have to restrain him. This sense of theatricality comes out even in Hansa Vilak, though it briefly recedes in Vasantha Obeyesekeres Palangetiyo and Lesters own Kaliyugaya, where the Piyal we encounter has become more cunning, clever, and at the same time cruel, than hisprevious incarnation. 
Being more a student of film than of drama, I cant possibly chart his contributions to the theatre in this country. While I have both seen and read Hunuwataye Kathawa and Makarakshaya (the later version, by Dharmasiri Bandaranayake), I cant go beyond a few cursory sketches at most. In that sense, The Play is The Thing is a more accessible and clear account of his work in the theatre, as it traces his career through childhood encounters with Rukmani Devi and the Minerva Group and the clashes and conflicts that led him to with his family. In chapter after chapter, he describes how difficult he found it to escape to the theatre, and how afraid he was of telling his father that he was staging a play of his own at his second school, Nalanda College. All these encounters were, moreover, the result of a childhood spent voraciously exploring libraries. As he later put it to Malinda Seneviratne, To me, literature refers to works that are of lasting quality. That is what separates a good book from a popular book. It was this attitude, of creating a lasting as opposed to a popular work, which made him explore the theatre (through visits to Russia and Britain) and bring down what he could from the rest of the world to the Navarangahala,the Lumbini Theatre, and the Wendt.

Henry did not take part in many films (only 20, compared with 120 by Tony). The few he did take part in, however, were miles away from the plays he produced.

Henry was the last of the great twilight dramatists - we can add to that category Sugathapala Silva, Premaranjith Tilakaratne, Gunasena Galappaththi, and Dayananda Gunawardena - who rebelled against the conventional theatre (laden with religious parables) and emphasised on the dialogues. Sugathapala was the loner here, given that Galappaththi, Gunawardena, and even Jayasena dabbled in the theatre of colour and costume (which he did not). But Jayasena, perhaps having despaired of the colours and the costumes he exhibited with Hunuwataye Kathawa and Kuveni, resorted to the austere and the cynical in Apata Puthe Magak Nathe, probably the most politically charged play (though it did not have a political message as such) of the sixties. 
This play, banned for some time before eventually being staged, was seminal in that it broke away from the standard set by other productions at the time. Even Sugathapala de Silva, in as landmark a dramatic work as Boarding Karayo, could not go beyond the rebellious youth troupe inspired by the Angry Young Men of sixties working class England. With Apata Puthe Magak Nathe, Jayasena succeeded in bridging the gap between the individual and the wider society which his contemporaries had tried to bridge, but could not. When the mother of the protagonist, after hearing that he has committed suicide, comes onstage, she lets out her feelings of anger and remorse, and being unable to indict the world, she indicts her son. It was a fitting metaphor: in years to come, the young, angry at the rifts their society had sustained, would go beyond those elders and rebel against that society. Jayasenas greatest contribution may have been his prediction about the way the young would channel their rage in later years, not against their superiors, but against the very social fabric on which they stood.

Implementing changes to the Kandy Esala Perahera :   Up-country & low-country  gap widening
	
During ancient days Sri Lankans were divided as up-country and low-country each having a foolish proudness to say that they are from Kandy or from Galle etc. With the progress of the nation, this divide was reduced and now no one says that he/she is an up-country or low-country person in public, except in some marriage proposals  but both parties identify themselves as Sri Lankans.
On the morning of 15th August, at 6.30 a.m. a certain FM news channel said that the Chief Custodian of the Dalada Maligawa (Temple of the Sacred Tooth Relic) Nilanga Dela Bandara has decided to remove Goyam Netuma and Wewel Netuma from the Kandy Esala Perahera, on the grounds that they are low-country dances and are not fitting to be in the most important event of the up-country event  the world famous Kandy Procession.
People think that this move will again start division of the country as up-country and low-country, thus creating a rift within the Sinhala community itself, which is almost extinct now. If the so called low-country administrators decided to remove up-country dances from their low-country processions and events, what would be the situation

A procession or perahera or a public event, is a national event covering entire Sri Lanka and should embody all forms of dances and rituals of Sri Lanka, of all nationalities and identities, to show unity among our people

A procession or perahera or a public event, is a national event covering entire Sri Lanka and should embody all forms of dances and rituals of Sri Lanka, of all nationalities and identities, to show unity among our people.

Currently we are trying to promote and improve relationships between the Sinhala and Tamil communities by the reconciliation process. Therefore, Mr. Nilanga Dela Bandaras decision is not a wise one.
We hope that top government administrators and Buddhist Prelates of Kandy will think twice before implementing this harsh anti-social and anti-national decision of Mr. Bandara.

Indonesian slum turned Rainbow Village
	

Tucked away in the small village of Kampung Pelangi in Semerang, Central Java is now an official Instagram sensation after being painted with all the colours of the rainbow. Following the trend started in other Indonesian villages of Kampung Warna-warni and Kampung Tridi in Malang, and later Kampung Kali Code in Yogyakarta, 232 homes have been converted into works of art. Initiated by 54-year-old junior high Principal Slamet Widodo, the project was created with the aim to make the slum areas beautiful, therefore giving the residents a chance to be actively involved with the improvement of their homes. Every house, shop, pavement and even the mosque have been covered with brightly coloured paint, donated with the help of the government and generous individuals to the cost of USD 22,000. Each house uses at least three different colours of paint but the real gems are the painted art that adorns many of the walls. A giant set of blue wings adorns the side of one building while cartoon monsters and animals are also popular. From 3D designs to polka dot print, the designs are candy-shop pretty, with plans already for another few hundred houses to be painted in the hope that Kampung Pelangi will become the largest rainbow village in Indonesia. The money generated by tourism will inject some much-needed cash flow for the development of the village, and tourism is already on the rise with eager explorers both local and foreign, coming to get that perfect social media snap. Benefits to the economy by growing tourist numbers have already been noticed, especially by food outlets and souvenir shops. The next step in improving Kampung Pelangi is the cleaning of the heavily polluted river, another step in the right direction for the development of the rainbow village into a home and community, the residents can be proud of, and enjoy for years to come.

JO mulls legal action against UPFA Secretarys decision
	
The Joint Opposition (JO) yesterday said it was ready to take legal action against UPFA Secretary and Minister Mahinda Amaraweera for giving his 'personal' opinion on the Opposition Leader's post claiming it as the party's opinion.
Addressing a news briefing, MP C.B. Ratnayake said Minister Amaraweera had given his personal opinion to Speaker Karu Jayasuriya on the matter of Opposition Leader's post without consulting the UPFAs Executive Council.
This is a personal opinion of the UPFA Secretary as other Executive Council members have not been consulted. We are ready to take legal action in this regard, he said.
Meanwhile, MP Udaya Gammanpila who addressed the briefing said the UPFA Executive Council had not been convened in over a year.
He said JO Leader Dinesh Gunawardane and UPFA MPs Susil Premajayantha also represent the Executive Council but they had not been consulted over the decision taken with regard to Opposition Leaders Post. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

MR, CBK eligible to contest again 
	
Some legal experts are of the opinion that former President Mahinda Rajapaksa is not debarred from contesting the Presidential Election for the third time, it is learnt.
These legal experts believe though the 19th Amendment barred anyone from seeking the Presidency for the third time, it did not have retrospective effect.
That they believed, it did not apply to the past Presidents, who served two terms.
Therefore, they opine that Mr Rajapaksa had the legal eligibility to contest the Presidential polls if he is interested.
However, the Supreme Court has to give its opinion in this regard. For that purpose, it is likely that a voter will make a Fundamental Rights application to the Supreme Court in the future. (Kelum Bandara)

## Title: Notes for a Manifesto The state

Notes for a Manifesto The state
	
Last week I wrote a brief note to presidential hopefuls (if) as they ponder manifestos. I pointed out that theres been a lot of hot air and little substance when it came to programmes. The basic thrust was that we need to move beyond rhetoric and the easy default option of cannibalizing old texts and slogans. I promised to elaborate on issues I believe that candidates, parties and especially voters should consider seriously. That partial list of issues included the state. 
There is certainly talk of the state. It typically happens when constitutional reform is the subject at hand. The nature of the state has been reduced, in the discourse, to two things. First, whether it should remain unitary or whether it should be reconstituted as a federal formation. Secondly, theres debate about the position of religion. Lets consider these two issues briefly. 
Those who support the unitary formation demonstrate a fear that an alternative (federal) would be precursor to division. The fear partly lies in the gross and historical postulations by the federalists who have superimposed devolution lines on a map drawn by an unknown British cartographer with absolute ignorance of history and geography. In other words, a map of so-called historical homelands based on the strokes of a frivolous pencil. The intent of separation in conjunction with the artful methodology prescribed by one of its founder ideologues, S.J.V. Chelvanayakam (A little now, more later), naturally gave and gives rise to suspicion. 
The federalists draw from history the instances of multiple regimes functioning independently of one another in the island. Suzerainty is not a word they seem to have heard of. When history is long, it makes for selective picking. The federalists and the Unitarians are both aces at this. It is not a subject that should be dismissed out of hand but certainly one that has to be unshackled from the humbuggery it is burdened by. 

Is the state a matter that is composed solely by the above two issues Well, theres a third matter where the state is mentioned

The same goes for the matter of religion. Recently, M.A. Sumanthiran contended that there was a separate Tamil kingdom on this island in order to buttress a devolution argument. He never mentioned boundaries and desisted from obtaining from the long history (as opposed to history - segments of convenience). If we go back to obtain formulation, then we cant pick and choose. However, if we decide to go back, then we can go to the Kandyan Convention and the status of Buddhism that was agreed upon. Then we shall see the current formulation pertaining to religion as a historical injustice. 
Now, the mischievous, cry in horror at Article 9 (Status of Buddhism) are quiet about its effective negation in Articles 10 and 14(1)(e). Moreover, the secularist call is silent about the long history of privilege enjoyed by certain religious communities, the relevant percentages, the truth of privilege and subjugation in nations where non-Buddhist religious communities dominate and the enormous privileges currently enjoyed by non-Buddhist religious communities right here in Sri Lanka. 
That said, the separation of religion from the state is an issue that needs to be discussed openly and at length, bringing in all relevant histories, numbers and current realities and not corralled into a cul-de-sac of selective reference and prescription without substance. 
Is the state a matter that is composed solely by the above two issues Well, theres a third matter where the state is mentioned. The term that is common is welfarist state. Welfare is a word that is associated typically with the underprivileged, the peripheral and poor. The role of the state, accordingly, is in part to provide a safety net to catch those who could otherwise fall by the wayside. 
Is this what our state does, though While welfare measures have boosted access to health and education, for instance, and have produced a lot of statistics that politicians, academics and development experts can brag about, the question is asked, can we really afford it Sometimes it is formulated thus: should we continue with it Blanket subsidies are certainly hard to defend, but neither is complete abolishing an option. Thats something that needs to be discussed. 
However, what is most interesting in all this is the reluctance to see the other element of welfarism in this state; the subsidies extended to capital interests directly and indirectly far outweigh the collective dishing-out to the masses, to put it bluntly. Furthermore, such magnanimity has been marked but cronyism, subjugation to the dictates of big name nations, and utter lack of reason in terms of long-term benefits including economic security to the country. 
An anecdote would perhaps put things in perspective. When Chandrika Kumaratunga came to power vowing to put an end to dhooshanaya (corruption) and bheeshanaya (terror, read it as any kind of coercion), there was a series of strikes. Not too long after assuming power, the lady said I promised freedom but not freedom of the wild ass. Well, freedom of the wild ass is what capital interests have enjoyed for decades. 

Where are the airtight regulations Where are the rules that cant be bent Where are the mechanisms that stop politicians and officials from bailing out errant corporate thugs When will candidates and parties start thinking about the role of the state

Where are the airtight regulations Where are the rules that cannot be bent Where are the mechanisms that stop politicians and officials from bailing out errant corporate thugs In short, when will candidates and parties start thinking about the role of the state, what it should and should not do and how 
There is a common dismissive; its the global that dictates. Thats poppycock. There is nothing inexorable about the global. If that were the case all states would be identical, which of course is not the case. There is and therefore there can be contestation. Whereas isolation is obviously not an option, neither is submission to the prescription by multilateral organizations and nations that have mandated themselves to promote capital interests. 
The state has always erred in favour of the commons being robbed. When this is left untouched, everything else is reduced to an argument over crumbs. What we have now is an erroneous characterization of the state and its role and a selective vilification of anything that the state does for those who are short-changed, insulted and humiliated. 
The state, friends, is where ideology is most apparent. It is the one place where few look for ideology, ironically. Leave it intact and all victories in battles fought in its appendages are hollow. 
A word of advice to the voter: treat with suspicion any candidate or party that neglects to offer a cogent elucidation of the state.

PC polls in Jan. if delimitation report is approved
	
Elections Commission Chairman Mahinda Deshapriya said today that elections to six provincial councils could be held in January 2019 if Parliament approved the delimitation report this month.
This was after Minister, Mahinda Samarasinghe told reporters that Parliament would take up the delimitation report for debate on August 24.
The main impediment to holding the PC polls was the delay in approving the delimitation report as it is mandatory to demarcate new provincial council boundaries on the basis that the PC polls will be held under the new electoral system. (Sandun A Jayasekera)

Presidents assures Commission for all Public Sector, not only for Railways
	
President Maithripala Sirisena in his discussion with railway TUs had stated that a Special Commission would be appointed to review the salaries in the entire Public Sector, not just the Railways Department, Cabinet Co-Spokesman Minister Rajitha Senaratne said yesterday.
Accordingly, the proposal made to President Sirisena by Finance and Mass Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera to appoint a Commission, which includes experts of each sector, was approved by the Cabinet on Tuesday.
Minister Senaratne told the Cabinet briefing that said the commission should be appointed immediately and added that issues relating to the salaries of Public Service would be solved through the Commission within two months.
Q: The Railway trade unions are saying the Governments decision to establish a Commission without giving a specific solution to their issue, is a wrong decision. They are also warning another strike.
A: This is what stated by President Sirisena during the discussion with them. They had called off the work stoppage accordingly.
Q: Is it fine if Cabinet decision is not be implemented upon the rejection of the Ministers
A: The Cabinet has taken a policy decision. However, according to that mechanism, a salary hike should be given to the other sectors of Public Service, which are of the same grading.
Q: Will there be no salary hike in the middle of the year Has the Government decided to increase salaries only through a Budget The Finance Minister has said so.
A: The government has not taken such a decision. Maybe he is referring to a ministerial decision.
Q: Will Railways employees wait for two months to get their issues resolved
A: Is not it possible to wait for another two months as they stayed up until now
Q: Will 6/2006 circular be changed in this procedure
A: Many issues have been created due to it. The salaries of all the sectors in public service should be increased if salaries of one sector are increasing. It is very unsuccessful.
Q: Have calculations been made on the loss incurred due to strike by Railways Department Can it be recovered
A: It cannot be recovered in such a way. However, media has made some calculations on the loss and had published them.
Q: What will happen to the National Salaries and Cadre Commission with the establishment of this new Commission
A: The new Commission will be appointed temporarily. (Dayana Udayangani)

Ranil Wickremesinghe:  A gruelling journey in politics

Wickremesinghe survived many a crisis and continues to show the political acumen of a seasoned politician
	
	It seems that Wickremesinghe is working on obtaining the votes of Tamils, whether it be for him or the UNP
	
	Sirisena has been non-committal about whether he would contest the 2020 Presidential Elections


Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe has struggled somewhat to carryout his business and economic ideas for the betterment of the nation during the Yahapalana Regime due to many decisions taken by President Maithripala Sirisena.
It is no secret that Wickremesinghe and Sirisena are engaged in a cold war with the latter having his way because of the powers vested upon him through the Executive Presidency. Premier Wickremesinghe has proposed ways of enhancing Government income through taxes, ideas to which the president has not been receptive. The last occasion when the President reversed a decision taken by a Wickremesinghe ally, Mangala Samawarweera, was when the Finance Minister increased fuel prices last July. We also remember Sirisena preferring to watch the no confidence motion against Wickremesinghe unfold quite passively and also the removal of the premier as the Minister for Law and Order, after just 11 days in this post. 
But Wickremesinghe survived many a crisis and continues to show the political acumen of a seasoned politician. A few days ago the Chief Incumbent of the Mirisawetiya Temple Ven. Ethalawetuna Wewa Dhanatilake was quoted in the newspapers saying that many Buddhist monks had, during the time of the late Ven. Sobitha Thera, made a request to Wickremesinghe not to leave the country and continue with his political career. 

Its not only the clergy, even the minorities would wish to see Wickremesinghe in politics and also deal with him. He has been a politician who continues to include the minorities inhis plans

Its not only the clergy, even the minorities would wish to see Wickremesinghe in politics and also deal with him. He has been a politician who continues to include the minorities in his plans. A few days ago he was well received in Nuwara Eliya when he attended the opening ceremony of Mahatma Gandhi Puram, a housing project which is funded by the Indian Government. This phase of the Indian Government funded programme will see as many as 4000 houses being build in the Central Hills. This is apart from 46,000 houses to be built by the Government of India (GoI) for the benefit of people displaced by the war. 


2020 Presidential Elections

UNP loyalists are demanding that Wickremesinghe name the partys candidate for the next presidential elections which are expected to be held in 2020. But his delaying this vital party decision only makes matters worse for the Green Party which is struggling to win the hearts of the Sinhala Buddhists in the island. 
But Wickremesinghe knows well that despite calls by critics to show what this Government has done as real development, the cards he is playing in terms of talking about reducing the debt service and wanting to work along with China and India have served him well. 
It seems that Wickremesinghe is working on obtaining the votes of the minority Tamils, whether it be for him or the UNP, atfuture elections. 

A few days ago he was well received in Nuwara Eliya when he attended the opening ceremony of Mahatma Gandhi Puram, a housing project which is funded by the Indian Government

He has made it clear that the work of the Central Highway Project will begin soon with the help of India and China. He has said that the Chinese Government, Chinese companies, the Government of India and Sri Lankan companies will also have opportunities in getting involved in the construction of this transport facility. Wickremesinghe like Mahinda Rajapaksa knows well to keep ends warm with India and look to China as the emerging force in Asia. China, in the long-run, prefers to deal with a president of the likes of Mahinda Rajapaksa. But given their interest in having a say in the ports of other Asian countries, China will still continue to forge deals with the present Sri Lankan Government, despite the rift between the top two heads of this regime. 
But with just about over an year for the next Presidential Elections, Wickremesinghe has placed his foot in the Tamil community to garner support, probably for himself. If it was for the party he would have by now named the UNPs candidate for the 2020 President Elections. Given the manner in which Wickremesinghe is maneuvering in the political scene all pointers are that he wishes to be UNPs candidate at the next big election. He has been Sri Lankas Premier twice before and if he is habouring dreams of becoming President one day they are logical after all. 


Mahinda and Gota

Wickremesinghe also sees the same set-up in the main opposition, now formed by a new political group called the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna, which is spearheaded by former President Rajapaksa. A similar scenario can be seen in the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) where President Sirisena is the Chairperson. Even at this juncture Sirisena has been non-committal about whether he would contest the 2020 Presidential Elections. 
In this bleak political scenario in Sri Lanka there is one person who breathes some life into the fading hearts of the people. He is none other than former Defence Secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa. Gotabaya has continued to self-promote himself through the Viyath Maga Programme. Political critics opine that Mahinda Rajapaksa is behind in his campaign to field a competent candidate for the 2020 Presidential Elections. Mahinda has been eternally postponing offering his support to Gotabaya despite there being a recent meeting where the duo were featured in talks with the Leader of the Opposition R. Sampanthan. 

Wickremesinghe like Mahinda Rajapaksa knows well to keep ends warm with India and look to China as the emerging force in Asia. China, in the long-run, prefers to deal with a president of the likes of Mahinda Rajapaksa

We know Wickremesinghe being arrogant and a kind of a dictator within the UNP. He can now snap his fingers and recall how former President Rajapaksa once told voters to consider him at one of the presidential elections which is similar to saying, The known devil is better than the unknown angel. 
UNPers are chanting the names of Sajith Premadasa and Navin Dissanayake as potential candidates from the Green Party at the next Presidential Elections. Its not that Wickremesinghe doesnt hear these cries. But he seems to be telling voters in no uncertain terms that they in instead should see in him a veteran politician whose best will be seen towards the end of his career.

Right of reply Do away with Medical Officers of Health A response to Kusal Perera
	
Two weeks ago, the , on July 27, 2018, carried yet another article by Kusal Perera slamming the medical profession. In this piece, Perera argues that increasing the number of medical doctors by establishing new state medical faculties will be useless because the doctors they produce will occupy redundant administrative positions in the public sector. Perera attributes the continuing decline in the health service to medical doctors holding administrative positions like the Medical Officer of Health (MOH), a position that he suggests should be done away with, and be replaced by trained paramedical workers. 

The MOH is not a glamorous position in the medical hierarchy which places hospital-based specialistsat the apex
	
	I have met a numberof dynamic MOHsworking tirelessly withlimited resources

While elements of Pereras argument are compelling, such as his condemnation of the autocratic nature of the medical establishment and his critique of public sector doctors engaging in private practice, Pereras social positioning and his deep-seated contempt for the medical profession blinds him to the critical role played by the MOH in the preventive health sector. 


MOH and the health system

The MOH is a vestige of the health units system introduced in British Ceylon by the Rockefeller Foundation who arrived on the island in the early 20th century to deal with the hookworm scourge on tea plantations. Disgruntled by an uncooperative Planters Association, the Rockefeller Foundation shifted its sanitary efforts to the Western Province where the inaugural health unit was set up in Kalutara in 1926. 
The health units system gradually expanded to cover the entire island. Serving the demands of imperial medicine, medical doctors were assigned to health units where they worked towards promoting maternal and child health and preventing the spread of communicable diseases. Thus medical doctors did not usurp the MOH position in the 1970s as per Pereras argument. 
At present, the country is divided into 330 plus MOH areas, each led by a MOH.These areas are further split into Public Health Inspector Areas, which, in turn, are divided into Public Health Midwife areas, each (ideally) covering a population of ~3000 to 5000. The MOH teams up with a public health nursing sister, public health nurses, public health inspectors and public health midwives, to deliver preventive health services in the relevant MOH Area. 
The MOH is not a glamorous position in the medical hierarchy which places hospital-based specialists at the apex. Yet, these doctors are essentially the linchpin of the preventive health sector, coordinating between MOH public health teams and district level health administrators. They oversee service delivery at the community level, including maternal and child health, family planning, and communicable and non-communicable disease prevention, while carrying out medical consultations at maternal and child health clinics. They also play a crucial role in disease notification, the School Health Programme and other community-based health education initiatives, and are responsible for food sanitation, and occupational and environmental health. 
Admittedly, many of these functions are not carried out optimally owing to crippling staff shortages at all levels. Cadre positions lie vacant in many remote and rural areas. In the Northern Province, for example, field midwives often cover two public health midwife areas, with grave implications for public health. As Perera points out, the Government needs to invest much more in this system. 


Misplaced criticism

Perera suggests that we do away with the MOHs as it is a wholly irrelevant position in community life. He attributes the rise in dengue to the incompetency of MOHs. It is unclear on what basis he makes these claims. It is well recognised that dengue is a product of rapid and unplanned urbanisation compounded by a crisis in garbage disposal. The health sector cannot do very much about the spread of dengue without the necessary support from government and non-health sectors. It is farfetched to attribute the failure of the preventive sector vis--vis dengue, the resurgence of leprosy, and even a lack of sanitary facilities,to MOHs being doctors. 
Moreover, Pereras allegations do little justice to the many socially minded MOHs who do not engage in private practice. While working in the health sector, I have met a number of dynamic MOHs working tirelessly with limited resources. In addition to running primary care clinics and overseeing the work of public health inspectors and public health midwives, they have been responsible for initiating various health promoting activities within their respective MOH areas. Examples from Jaffna District include the promotion of organic home gardening and the use of a nutritious mix of grains and cereals (saththa maa) manufactured locally to address malnutrition, which is rampant in the Northern Province. While Perera labels such activities as completely irrelevant, he unwittingly contradicts his own position that prevention is better than cure. 
Also notably absent in Pereras analysis are the successes of the preventive health sector in spite of medical doctors holding positions of administration. For instance, its role in the much proclaimed low maternal mortality ratio and, more recently, WHO certification for malaria elimination. Despite such achievements, financial allocations to the preventive sector have declined over the years as more and more funds are channeled toward curative care. Rather than focusing solely on doctors, Perera should expose the Governments role in Sri Lankas health sector crisis. 


Need for clarity

Pereras criticism of the medical profession and private practice is valid. However, his writings are confused and often unsubstantiated. For instance, during the SAITM crisis and student boycott, Pereras antipathy to the medical profession led him to undermine the students call to protect free education. In fact, he supported the governments efforts to privatise medical education by taking a questionable position on SAITM.
His latest article (Daily Mirror, August 10th 2018), an attack of the Sri Lanka Medical Council, suggests that the joint statement of Deans of state medical faculties on SAITM was manipulated by the Federation of Faculty of Medicine Teachers Associations (far from the truth in most if not all medical faculties). Perera is unable to see that the establishment of for-profit medical degree-awarding institutions like SAITM could jeopardize medical education in the country. 
Many of the positions Perera articulates in his articles, including the denigration of MOHs, smack of Colombo-centric middle class elitism; trashing the public sector, including state hospitals and universities, is standard dinner table conversation in Colombo. In his pro-people analysis, Perera seems to have forgotten the ordinary families who rely on the public sector, including the MBBS qualified MOH (not a private sector specialist), for their maternal and child health needs. 


Words of caution

Yes, medical doctors are not the saviours and guardians of the health sector, and they should embrace other healthcare professionals instead of obstructing their entry into the health sector. Yes, the maldistribution of medical officers should be addressed rather than placing them in administrative positions in Colombo. Having said that, however, Perera should be wary of trends in other parts of the world where physician administrators are increasingly replaced by MBA degree holders and others of that ilk who are trained to maximize cost-effectiveness and profits in the health sector. Second, Perera should think twice before supporting task shifting, a particularly neocolonial approach that has its basis in the assumption that poorer communities in rural and remote areas can be served by a low cost paramedical healthcare workforce. Finally, I urge Perera to separate his contempt for the medical profession and the Government Medical Officers Association from his analysis of the public health sector in order to offer a more informed critique in his writings.

Riu Sri Lanka indulges in socially responsible agendas
	
Riu Sri Lanka, the countrys largest all-inclusive resort with a stunning 501 rooms, recently held a tree planting and beach cleaning programme as part of its social and community responsible activities. The resort is ambitious and confident to actively take part in a number of similar initiatives in future.
One of the greatest problems that the world is facing today is environmental pollution, which is occurring on a vast and unprecedented scale around the globe. Thankfully many individuals, organizations and businesses are choosing to help out by putting a percentage of their time and profits aside.
Riu Sri Lanka with a motive to contribute to a cleaner and greener environment focuses on two major challenges- air pollution and water pollution, and strongly believes in giving back to the local community. The hotel planted many king-coconut trees along the shore with the participation of government officials, staffs and locals. Planting trees undoubtedly produce clean air, reduce carbon, and provide shelter to birds and other wildlife.
The hotel also recently spent a whole day together with its staffs in a beach cleaning activity with unlimited food and beverage spread out at the shore, and surprisingly many of their guests volunteered for this worthy cause too. Tons and tons of rubbish especially plastic find its way into the worlds oceans every year and it is causing significant threat to marine life and sea birds. Riu Sri Lanka managed to collect a total of around 126kgs of trash on that day with plastic accounting to over 30kgs.
With the privilege of being the first and only all-inclusive hotel in the island and probably the largest resort with 501 rooms, the five-star rated Riu Sri Lanka is the ideal destination for a family break, an unforgettable honeymoon or a holiday with friends. In fact, right now is the best moment for locals to book the Riu experience since the hotel has excellent rates with a 30pct discount and kids stay free up to 5 years old, and from 6 to 12, they only pay 25pct of the rate (riu.com, reservations.srilanka@riu.com or 0 915 22 00 22)

Safe Space For Youth; Vital For Stable Society
	
Last Sunday August 12 was International Youth Day and the United Nations revealed some figures which were staggering or shocking and need to be redressed effectively and urgently. The UN says, there are now about 1.8 billion young people between the ages of 10 and 24 in the world. This is the largest youth population ever. But one in 10 of the worlds children live in conflict zones and 24 million of them are out of school. Political instability, labour market challenges and limited space for political and civic participation have led to increasing isolation of youth in societies.
According to the UN, August 12 was first designated International Youth Day by the UN General Assembly in 1999 and serves as an annual celebration of the role of young women and men as essential partners in change and an opportunity to raise awareness on challenges and problems facing the worlds youth.
In terms of a solution to this major crisis because it involves the next generation of leaders and affects all countries including Sri Lanka in a special way, the UN has proposed that the youth need safe spaces where they can come together, engage in activities related to their diverse needs and interests, participate in decision-making processes and freely express themselves.
In Sri Lanka government leaders need to reflect deeply as to what extent this is happening here and what needs to be done urgently. The crisis has special significance because of the two youth insurrections in 1971 and 1987/89 in addition to the 26-year ethnic war in which hundreds of thousands of youth were killed or injured in all parts of the country.
Few if any other countries have gone through such a catastrophe and that is why government leaders, civic action groups and even opposition parties need to put petty party politics or self-interest aside and act effectively to give the youth a bigger say in decision-making on key issues such as poverty alleviation, global warming or
climate change. 
According to the UN while there are many types of spaces, safe spaces ensure the dignity and safety of youth. Safe spaces such as civic spaces enable youth to engage in governance issues. Public spaces afford youth the opportunity to participate in sports and other leisure activities in the community. Digital spaces help youth interact virtually across borders with most people while well-planned physical spaces can help accommodate the needs of diverse youth especially those vulnerable to marginalisation or violence.
Ensuring that safe spaces are inclusive, youth from diverse backgrounds, especially those from outside the local community, need to be assured of respect and self-worth. In humanitarian or conflict prone settings for example, youth may lack the space to fully express themselves without feeling uncomfortable or unwelcome. Similarly, without the existence of safe space, youth from different races or ethnicity, gender, religious affiliation or cultural background may feel intimidated to freely contribute to the community. When youth have safe spaces to engage, they can effectively contribute to development, including peace and social cohesion.
Furthermore, UNs New Urban Agenda reiterates the need for public spaces for youth to enable them to interact with family and have constructive inter-generational dialogue. Additionally, the World Programme of Action for Youth which is the UN framework for youth development, prioritizes the provision of leisure activities as essential to the psychological, cognitive and physical development of young people. 
In Sri Lanka it is vital that effective space be given for youth of all races and religions so that such programmes will not only be effective but also will contribute towards the multi-racial and multi-religious unity in diversity - a vital factor to build a just, peaceful and all-inclusive society with active or pro-active youth participation in a creative and enterprising manner, with a role in decision- making.

Search for survivors after deadly Italy bridge collapse
	

Italian rescuers searched through the night Wednesday for any survivors under the shattered remains of a motorway bridge in Genoa as investigators probed what could have caused such a catastrophic collapse. 
More than 30 people were killed on Tuesday when a vast span of the Morandi bridge collapsed during a heavy rainstorm, sending about 35 cars and several trucks plunging 45-metres onto railway tracks below. 
Rescuers spent the night within the tangled remains of the bridge under floodlights and there are fears the toll could rise in what the Italian government has called an immense tragedy. 
The collapse came as the bridge was undergoing maintenance work and as the Liguria region, where Genoa is situated, experienced torrential rainfall. 
Unfortunately there are around 30 dead and many injured in a serious condition, Interior Minister Matteo Salvini said on Wednesday, vowing that those responsible would pay, pay everything, and pay dearly. 
On Wednesday morning, sources in the interior ministry quoted by Italian media estimated that the death toll had risen to 35, including three children aged from eight to 12 years old. Sixteen people are also wounded, including 12 in serious condition. 
Italian President Sergio Mattarella said a catastrophe had hit Genoa and the whole of Italy.
Italians have the right to modern and efficient infrastructure that accompanies them safely through their everyday lives, Mattarella said in a statement. 
- Not giving up hope - Rescuers scoured through the wreckage, strewn among shrubland and train tracks, as rescue helicopters winched survivors on stretchers from the ruined bridge.

SLMC wants Prof. Gunaratne to clarify his statement
	
The Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) has called for an explanation from its former chairman Prof. Colvin Gunaratne in connection with the baseless statements he had made against the functioning of the SLMC, the GMOA said today.
GMOA Secretary Haritha Aluthge told a news conference that the SLMC had written to Prof. Gunaratne asking him to clarify the statements he had made to the media.
He said Prof. Gunaratne should do so immediately and pointed out that all the allegations he had levelled were false and baseless.
He claimed the primary objective of the Medical Ordinance was to safeguard the rights of patients, but however it was catering to the needs of the doctors because of the SLMCs composition and that 16 out of the 25 members of the SLMC were elected from trade unions of doctors, Dr. Aluthge said.
These statements are not true. Prof. Gunaratne has been a member of the SLMC for many years, even before his appointment as its chairman. However, he kept silent all these years despite having had the opportunity to correct whatever shortcomings if any, he said.
Meanwhile, GMOA Assistant Secretary Naveen de Soyza asked why there was a delay in appointing a new chairman for the SLMC even though the resignation of Prof. Gunaratne had been approved. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)

## Title: The promise of real estate investment made true by CBH Lands

The promise of real estate investment made true by CBH Lands
	
Yatila Wijemanne, Chairman & Co-Founder, and Manjarie Tissera Wijemanne, Deputy Chairman & Co  Founder of CBH Lands (Pvt) Ltd
Land as an asset has been valued for centuries. Property ownership is seen as a social status marker as well as a secure investment at times of need. Real Estate is increasingly becoming the most attractive investment option, as the land value continues to rise not only in the urban areas but also expanding to the rural areas. However, the predicaments of investing in land is the strenuous process of finding the most suitable land for ones need, the legal and documentation process as well as the credibility of the company and the assurance of value for money.
This hardship is completely addressed by CBH Lands through their in-depth knowledge of real estate, commitment to offer the best in the market and highly skilled teams who efficiently handle every step of the process. Mainly based in Kurunegala and Homagama, CBH Lands are also available in other suburbs. The main plots in Kurunegala are diverse in landscape which also include paddy field - facing plots and river - facing plots. The lands are selected at rapidly growing real estate hot spots that will ensure an increment of land value over the years. For instance, Kurunegala will be a focal location in the Central Expressway which is due to be completed by 2019, reducing travel time to Kurunegala to a mere 1 hour from Colombo, thus ensuring a high return on investment to buyers.
CBH Lands is probably the only real estate investment house in the country, which is not only involved in the sale of land, but also in real estate investment consulting. The company conducts the total process of purchasing, developing, plotting and selling real estate sites which are handpicked by the experts. Each land undergoes a process of thorough legal scrutiny and documentation clearance. The company also takes care of infrastructure which includes constructing the roads, tarring, constructing the drainage and sewerage systems, and obtaining electricity and water. CBH Lands goes the extra length to clear all documentation and approvals, which at certain points involve around 21 government institutions, thus providing the buyer with a completely clear land purchase. However, this does not sky rocket the land value, as plots are even available from Rs. 65,000/- per perch onwards at CBH Lands, which is made possible through the wide range of land options spread across the Kurunegala district.
Purchasing land is a decision made with high consideration. Unfortunately the whole process discourages many potential investors. Therefore we established ourselves as a consulting house for real estate, and invest largely on obtaining the best lands and developing them to the highest capacity before sale, stated Yatila Wijemanne, Chairman and Co-Founderof CBH Lands (Pvt) Ltd.
The wealth of experience owned by CBH Lands provides buyers with the kind of consultancy unavailable elsewhere. For instance, bulk buying of property for future disposal is a common real estate investment trend. However, most property owners face issues at the point of disposal due to unplanned fragmentation. CBH Lands offers guidance and a systematic block out system which ensures that the land does not lose its value to factors such as in-roads. Furthermore, CBH Lands has fast become a preferred company for first time investors, who seek advocacy in making the correct decision in their first real estate investment.
All land plots available through CBH Lands are pre-facilitated, as they are invested upon by the company and further developed. The process is looked into much detail to the point where certain land plots have been declined at the time of transfer due to unavailability of clear documents. Moreover, lands that come through individuals claiming power-of-attorney are not facilitated by the company. These processes are in place to ensure the buyer with the much needed assurance of credibility and purchasing a clear land.
Throughout the years of experience in the industry, CBH Lands has also initiated two schemes to benefit women working overseas and tri forces current and retired. We used to come across instances where the women working abroad, especially in the Middle Eastern countries, send money to purchase land, but when the final transaction is complete, often the husband or another family member requests the land to be written under their name. It also happens with the tri forces. We directly discourage this and take extra steps to ensure that the land is transferred to the person who actually pays for it. It is for these reasons that we established the Ranliyaand Ranawiruschemes, added Manjarie Tissera Wijemanne Deputy Chairman and Co  Founder of CBH Lands (Pvt) Ltd.
Investment in real estate out of Colombo is increasingly proving to be profitable, the best example being Galle. The wealth of CBH Lands in Kurunegala and other areas have attracted many potential investors who have seen the timely opportunity and promising rise of land value. The lands can be utilized as future endowments, second or holiday homes, development and re-selling or leasing, or as basic assets. CBH Lands attention to detail in documentation, skills and experience in development, excessive knowledge of the industry together with their consultancy offers a complete and seamless purchase of the best quality land.

Three-wheeler driving liscence -- Minimum age of 35
	
Transport Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva said today his ministry had decided to impose a minimum age limit of 35 on three-wheeler drivers when issuing driving licenses for passenger transport.
He said there were about 1.2 million three-wheelers in the country and new rules and regulations would be introduced regarding the transportation of passengers in them.
The minister said passenger transportation in three-wheelers began at the end of the 1980s and there were no laws to regulate the service.
He said under the Motor Traffic Act, the licenses obtained by three-wheel drivers earlier would not be cancelled.
Those who obtain new three-wheeler driving licenses for passenger transport should undergo several examinations and should be 35 or above. Those under the age of 35 would be eligible for three-wheeler driving licenses only for home use. When issuing a license, the ministry would to check the applicant whether he or she was involved in any criminal activities," the minister said
He said applicants should undergo a two-week training session as recommended by the Commission of the Motor Traffic Department. (Chaturanga Samarawickrama)

Trash dolphin creates awareness on plastic pollution in Kalpitiya
     	 
  At the Daily Mirror, we believe that climate change is one of the greatest threats that we, as Sri Lankans, will face in the future.  Therefore, we intend to provide our readers with local and international content with the objective to educate and inspire. We would also like to learn from our valued readers about any ongoing initiatives in making Sri Lanka a more sustainable nation.   
 We aim to explore sustainable ways of living that have the most positive impact on not just our natural environment, but also for humans and animals.  
While topics such as global warming, pollution, and inequality are confronting, we believe it's time the media stopped shying away from these issues and became an active participant in finding solutions - and we hope you will join us. 
     
				 		 
	
	

180 kms away from Colombo, just outside of Kalpitiya at a nondescript turnoff towards the sea, there is a dolphin sculpture thats filled with trash collected from the adjoining Kudawa beach.
The dolphin sculpture was made by Ukrainian couple Dima Dubovik and Ksy Artishock and installed with donated materials and labour on July 19, 2018. The team was made up of volunteer local community member leaders with the organizing team made up of a group of friends from Ananta Sustainables, a sustainable packaging company based in Colombo, Project Eklok from India, which works to connect backpackers with local communities, Clean City, a waste management initiative based in Nepal and Lost in Ceylon, a Sri Lanka-centric travel blog. We wanted something that would grab the attention of anybody using the beach. The art was used as a medium to spur dialogue about the issue of waste management in the community, and its effect on marine ecosystems, said local resident Savera Weerasinghe, founder of Ananta Sustainables.


Sadly most of the time it is our local tourists from all over Sri Lanka who throw their garbage on our beaches after their dolphin watching trips. We have tried telling them but they dont seem to care.

The small, windy town of Kalpitiya has experienced a sudden rise in tourism in recent years, largely due to its growing reputation for dolphin watching and kite surfing. This has left it unprepared for the worsening trash problem that poses a threat to its rich ecosystem. Off the shores of Kalpitiya are mangrove lined islands, a diverse range of marine life, many species of migratory birds, the Bar Reef Sanctuary, the Kala Oya Estuary and Wilpattu National Park. Residents have begun to notice the impact that tourists and locals have on the environment.
Two such people are Sugath Emmanuel, the Head of one of Kalpitiyas fishermens associations and Priyankara Almeida, a local fisherman who worked with the team to organize two beach cleanups on Kudawa beach to collect the trash that went into the sculpture. Sadly most of the time it is our local tourists from all over Sri Lanka who throw their garbage on our beaches after their dolphin watching trips. We have tried telling them but they dont seem to care, said Sugath Emmanuel. While the members of Project Eklok and Clean City have returned to their respective countries, Ananta Sustainables and Lost in Ceylon intend to continue their efforts around Sri Lanka to address the issues of plastic pollution while enlisting the help of anyone who is willing to lend a hand. Visual storytelling was a huge part of the social media strategy for the Kalpitiya project. Our aim was to portray plastic trash using beautiful imagery that would evoke a deeper, emotional connection with viewers. Tashiya de Mel of Lost in Ceylon said.

UK Govt. to provide US$ 1.3 Mn for resettlement in SL
	
The Government of the United Kingdom in partnership with the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) launched a project worth US$ 1.3 Million to support more than 2,500 people returning to their homes in Jaffna, Kilinochchi, Mullaitivu and Batticaloa Districts.
The UNDP in Sri Lanka recently entered into a partnership agreement with the Government of the United Kingdom to extend support for Sustainable Resettlement of recently released lands in the Northern and Eastern provinces of Sri Lanka, a statement issued by the UNDP said.
Under this agreement, UNDP Sri Lanka will work in close collaboration with the Government of Sri Lanka to facilitate sustainable return, resettlement and integration of conflict-displaced persons, whilst strengthening institutions for equal and transparent access to services. The overall intended impact is to improve the wellbeing of conflict-affected communities in line with the Sri Lanka Peacebuilding Priority Plan, agreed by the Government of Sri Lanka and the UN to support long term peacebuilding and reconciliation, and the National Policy on Durable Solutions for Conflict Affected Displacement, he said.
It said the project will help those returning to their homes in the Jaffna, Kilinochchi, Mullaitivu and Batticaloa districts by supporting livelihood opportunities in fisheries, agriculture and livestock, and facilitating access to local government services.
It will also help families to rebuild their lives by promoting entrepreneurship through training in small business management, and by assisting in re-establishing community support structures and local civil society organizations, the statement added.
Commenting on this project, British High Commissioner to Sri Lanka, James Dauris said The UK is very pleased to support the return by families to their villages. This is a crucial element of addressing the legacy of the conflict and contributes to the steady progress being made. There remains a lot to do and, as a partner with a firm commitment to working with Sri Lanka, the UK is supporting the rebuilding process as well as encouraging the Government to deliver on its commitments to the people of this country and to the international community, he said.
The Sustainable Resettlement project will prioritise empowering women and youth, promoting diversity and inclusion, and reaching vulnerable and marginalised communities.

Won't allow hatred among ethnic groups: PM
	
Provoking hatred among religious and ethnic groups cannot be condoned and will not be allowed to fester here, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said yesterday.
The Prime Minister expressed this sentiment while participating in the Annual Feast of Our Lady of Madhu held last morning. There are groups that try to promote hatred among different ethnic groups in this country. We cannot allow this to happen, he said.All religions preach love and compassion but unfortunately, some groups try to promote hatred against other religions. We cannot allow such provocations to take place in this country, the Prime Minister added.
The Madhu Feast is celebrated by people of many ethnicities in this country. They arrive to pay obeisance and receive Gods blessings. The Sinhalese and Tamils worship here together in peace and harmony, as brothers and sisters. Events such as these bring about reconciliation in the country, especially following a conflict.
I have visited two religious events this year. One is in Kataragama where people from the North visit. The second is in Madhu where people visit from the South in large numbers for worship. Madhu is a place of reconciliation, the PM said.
Mr. Wickremesinghe was the second head of state to attend the Madhu feast. The first was late President Ranasinghe Premadasa. This was revealed by Archbishop of Colombo, Cardinal Malcolm Ranjith, who led the festive mass. (Yohan Perera and Sithum Chathuranga in Madhu)
