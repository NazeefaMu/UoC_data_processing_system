Duminda Dissanayake threatens me: Gota
	
Former Defence Secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa claimed that Minister Duminda Dissanayake had earlier threatened him to hand over the Chairmanship of Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) to incumbent President Maitripala Sirisena.
??I don?t say President Maithripala had threatened me. But Minister Duminda Dissanayake told me to hand over the party Chairmanship soon after the election. If not so, Dissanayake told me, that he knew how to take it by taking it to court. ?The government is ours,? he said. This is how they establish the democracy,? he said.
?Their objective was to split the main Opposition and recruit part of the members to the government,? former defence secretary said while addressing the Sri Lankans in Japan.
Speaking further the former Defence Secretary said that the previous Mahinda Rajapaksa regime had eliminated underworld activities, which were a threat to the people.
?The present government vowed to established law and order in the country. But today it is the exact opposite that is happening,? he said.

Lankan family who sheltered Snowden  in Hong Kong ?at risk of deportation?
	
The Sri Lankan asylum seekers who sheltered the American whistle-blower Edward Snowden in Hong Kong might be at risk of detention and deportation as their lawyer was not able to meet a final deadline imposed by the Immigration Department to file documents.
Robert Tibbo, a Canadian barrister who provided legal advice to Snowden when he was in the city in 2013, said 30 of his cases had been reactivated at the same time after at least two years of inactivity, leaving him unable to cope with the workload given his other work commitments.
?I understand I have been particularly targeted. They all know I have 30 cases that have been held in limbo and now this happens,? Tibbo said.
?To me this is a clear-cut strategy by the Hong Kong government to defeat my client cases by avoiding even looking at the merits of them. It is a grossly unfair procedure.?
This comes as a group of lawyers in Montreal is campaigning for the asylum seekers who helped Snowden in Hong Kong to be resettled in Canada. They housed the former US intelligence contractor for about two weeks back in 2013, shortly after he leaked classified documents that showed the extension of mass online surveillance by the American and other governments.
Tibbo was first asked on October 12 to file supplementary claim forms, in which additional grounds for claim could be stated for Supun Thilina Kellapatha and Nadeeka Dilrukshi Nonis, a couple from Sri Lanka. The final deadline was December 14.
The lawyer said he also missed the deadline for their two children.
Papers filed by protection claimants usually include their personal history, the threats faced in their home countries and updates on their nations? security situation.
Tibbo?s request to file all documents by the end of January was rejected by the Immigration Department.
An immigration officer said in a letter about Supun?s case that the duty?s lawyer schedule was ?not a reasonable excuse for any further delay in the submission? of supplementary claim forms.
The officer continued: ?We consider ample time and reasonable opportunities have been given to him [the claimant] to complete the supplementary claim forms and to seek advice from his legal representative.?
Failing to do so, the officer noted, ?his claim will be treated as withdrawn?.
Tibbo said that in such cases the government had the right to arrest and deport the claimant.
Vanessa Mae Rodel, a Filipino asylum seeker who has a four-year-old daughter, will soon be in a similar situation.
According to the lawyer, the only one who is not at risk of being deported in the near future is Ajith Pushpakumara, a former Sri Lankan soldier, as his supplementary claim form had already been submitted.
A spokesman for the Immigration Department said he would not comment on individual cases. However, he noted that ?it is the duty of a claimant to comply with every requirement, procedure and condition (including any time limit) ... specified by his case officer?.
He said ?claimants will not be removed/deported to a risk country until their non-refoulement claims have been finally determined as unsubstantiated or withdrawn?.
Marc-Andr? S?guin, who is involved in the campaign in Canada along with two other lawyers Francis Tourigny and Michael Simkin, called for an urgent solution. ?These families find themselves in a very exceptional circumstance ? I am not looking to make a precedent here, I want the result. I want them out of Hong Kong, safely, and in a country where they can be protected,? he said.
S?guin did not disclose the legal moves that the group was considering.
?If there is a political will and a will within the community to bring these families to Canada, there is a multitude of ways to see that happening,? he said. ?We are looking at a number of them and we are hopeful that government officials will do the same.?
The Canadian government has not commented on the chances that the three groups of individuals who helped the former National Security Agency contractor when he was in Hong Kong have of being resettled in Canada.
A communications adviser for Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada told the Post that refugees can go through two main programmes: the Refugee and Humanitarian Resettlement Program for people seeking protection from outside Canada; and the in-Canada Asylum Program for those making claims within Canada.
The three types of resettlement are: government assisted refugees, who are usually referred by organisations like the UN Refugee Agency; privately sponsored refugees, meaning that someone agrees to provide financial and other support for them over one year; and ?blended visa office-referred refugees?, in which the government and a private sponsor support a refugee who was referred by the UN Refugee Agency.
As of December 4, according to official statistics, 36,393 Syrian refugees had been resettled in Canada ? among them, 13,372 were privately sponsored.( South China Morning Post)

Lunch packet price to increase by Rs. 10
	
The price of a lunch packet will be increased by Rs. 10 from tomorrow, Canteen Owners Association said today.
Organiser of the Association Asela Sampath said the decision was taken after considering the increase of the rice prices in the country. ?The decision was not to gain profit. But the prices of rice are being increased day by day.
He said rice is being selling at various prices in the market and even in the Sathosa.
He said average price for a vegetable food packet is Rs. 100 and it will be increased to Rs. 110, a fish food packet will increased from Rs. 130 to Rs. 140 and a chicken food packet from Rs. 160 to Rs. 170.
Sampath said the government had failed to control the price for rice. ?There was no shortage of the rice at the moment in the country. However, some businessmen are hiding the rice to sell for animal food. We challenge the Consumer Affairs Authority, STF or any other institution to conduct an islandwide raid to find hidden rice being stored. ? he said.(DS)

Minister?s son flees early morning accident scene
	
A police probe is on concerning a minister's son who had allegedly knocked down a motorcyclist with his Prado, causing the latter to break his leg and a rib at Park Street Junction on Anagarika Dharmapala Mawatha early this morning (18).
In a bid to hush-up the accident, the driver of the vehicle had offered Rs.350,000 to the victim, without informing the police, soon after the accident.
According to the police, the minister?s son had reportedly driven the white Prado V8 at high speed from the Town Hall junction along Dharmapala Mawatha and taken a sharp turn into Park Street.
The motorcyclist who had come from Kollupitiya and was heading towards the Town Hall had been struck from the side by the turning Prado. The motorcycle bearing the registration number BEC 6735 had been extensively damaged.
The 21-year-old rider identified as Mohamed Risan Riyaf of Keselwatta had been rushed to the National Hospital, Colombo in a critical condition. He is being treated for a broken leg and rib and injuries on his face.
The rider was a part of a group of people who had visited the Viharamahadevi Park on Saturday night and was reportedly riding the motorcycle up and down Dharmapala Mawatha.
The accident had occurred at around 1.30 am when the minister?s son was reportedly returning from a nightclub near the Town Hall with some friends. As soon as the accident occurred the two parties had come to a settlement and agreed not to not to go to the police.
The minister?s son had immediately paid Rs.100,000 to the owner of the motorbike who was present at the scene and promised to pay him Rs.250,000 more, and left his Australian Driver?s Licence with the latter as security.
The driver and passengers of the Prado had left soon after; leaving the Prado and the keys at the scene. When a mobile motorcycle patrol of Cinnamon Gardens Police arrived there at around 2.20 am only the motorcyclist's friends had been present.
Police had taken both vehicles into custody and recorded statements from the motorcyclist?s friends. Police had later traced the Prado?s owner.
A man claiming to be the driver of the Prado had surrendered to the Cinnamon Gardens Police at around 11.00 am yesterday and given a statement.
However, the suspect had also surrendered to the police at around 3.00 pm and reportedly said in a statement that he had had to leave the scene in order to take the victim to hospital.
He had reportedly told the police that his Sri Lankan Driver?s Licence was not with him when he surrendered to the police.
Police did not rule out the possibility that the minister?s son had been under the influence of liquor at the time of the accident. But this could not be verified as he had not surrendered to the police until much later in the day.(Kurulu Koojana Kariyakarawana)

Prevent SL from enacting law to fine Indian fishermen: Vaiko
	
Decrying Sri Lankan Government?s reported move to bring in a new law to impose fine ranging from Rs. 7 lakh to Rs. 7 crore on Indian fishermen poaching in their waters, Marumalarchi Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (MDMK) leader Vaiko has urged the Centre to prevail upon the Lankan government and prevent it from enacting such a legislation.
Addressing a protest rally in Madurai on Friday, he said as the proposed law to come into force from January next was aimed at crushing the livelihood of the Tamil Nadu fishermen, Prime Minister Narendra Modi should exert pressure through diplomatic channels and restrain the Lankan government from coming out with the law.
?Finding a lasting solution to the fishermen issue may take time for Mr. Modi but he should act immediately on this issue,? Mr. Vaiko said. If the Prime Minister failed to do so, he would only ruin the livelihood of the fishing community, he said.
He said he had discussed the issue with Mr. Modi when he met him in Delhi on Thursday and explained in detail, the problems faced by Tamil Nadu fishermen to eke out their living, amid threats from the Lankan navy, whenever they set out for fishing in the Palk Bay.
On apprehensions expressed by fishermen leaders that the Lankan navy would attack the fishermen in retaliation to the protest demonstration, Mr. Vaiko said if the Lankan navy attacked the fishermen, he would take up the issue with Mr. Modi and stage a protest in New Delhi to ?teach a lesson? to the Lankan government.
Accusing the Lankan government of trying to create hatred between the Sri Lankan Tamil fishermen and Tamil Nadu fishermen, he said the fisher folk should sort out their differences and ensure that the livelihood of both the fishing community was protected.
Mr. Vaiko hit out at the Indian navy and Indian Coast Guard (ICG) for not coming to the rescue of the Tamil Nadu fishermen, when they were attacked by the Lankan navy even while in Indian waters and blamed the then Congress government for handing over Katchatheevu islet to Sri Lanka on a platter in 1974, which he said was the root cause of the problem.
Fishermen leaders ? U. Arulanandham, P. Sesu Raja, Devadoss, N. J. Bose, Emirat, Royappan and Sagayam and MDMK office bearers ? Seventhiappan, Nakkeeran, Durai, Balakrishnan, Azhagusundaram and Guna participated in the agitation. (The Hindu)

The Tamil National Alliance (TNA) and the Northern Provincial Council (NPC) had requested the government to reduce the power vested in the governors of the Provincial Councils.
??We wanted to reduce the powers vested with the governors because it is known that the governors have extreme powers as he was a representative of the Executive President?, TNA MP M.K.Sivajilingam.
He said the TNA and the NPC had presented this proposal because the council members couldn?t do anything without the approval of the governor.
He said this situation was equal to other Provincial Council as well
Meanwhile, NPC Chairman C.V.K. Sivagnanam said they had requested the Government to consider this proposal when amending the Constitution. ?However, we have no objection of President appointing them,? he said. (Romesh Madusanka)
