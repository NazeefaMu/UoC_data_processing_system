Foliage wall in Temple Trees removed
	
The outer perimeter wall of Temple Trees that was embedded with potted tropical bushes as part of the beautification operations conducted by the previous regime during the CHOGM 2013 was removed due to high maintenance cost.

Guanaratnam allegedly stole Aussie Mudalige?s identity
	
Controversial leftist party activist Kumar Gunaratnam, who went underground defying immigration laws is learnt to have allegedly stolen the identity of another man who already lives in Australia by the name Noel Mudalige, highly placed sources said.
Frontline Socialist Party Central Committee Member Premakumar Gunaratnam who took an alias to return to Sri Lanka early in 2011 arrived in the country as an Australian citizen.
Mudalige Noel as mentioned in his Australian travel document numbered N1016123 had been issued on May 05, 2009 and will be valid up to May 05, 2019. The passport which is under Type P stated Noel Mudalige?s birthday as November 18, 1969 and Kirulapone as the place of birth. However another source revealed that his actual date of birth was November 18, 1965.
The Daily Mirror was however told by informed sources that Gunaratnam used the personal details of another man who lived in Australia, to apply for his travel document with his own photograph.
It is reported that the actual person had faced great difficulty and is almost deprived of his rights since Gunaratnam had used details of the former.
This has been brought to the notice of the Australian authorities which will likely take legal action against Gunaratnam upon his return to Australian soil. Attempts to get a comment on this from the Australian High Commission were not successful.
Gunaratnam who escaped from the Bogambara Prison during the 1988 insurgency period subsequently fled the country probably through a sea route.
He then returned to the country in 2011 and suddenly went missing in April 2012, when he was believed to have been arrested by a state intelligence service. Gunaratnam who found to have overstayed his visa was deported to Australia the same year.
Nobody at the Frontline Socialist Party office picked up the phone to get a comment on this regard despite numerous attempts.
A joint operation by immigration sleuths and the police have been launched to locate Gunaratnam who refused to surrender to the authorities for overstaying his 30-day tourist visa.
Noel Mudalige arrived at the Bandaranaike International Airport on January 1, 2015 with an on arrival visa valid up to January 31. The Immigration Department requested the police to arrest him on sight. (Kevin Kariyawasam)

Probe on issuing of DPL passports next week
	
Public Order Minister John Amaratunga yesterday said a probe will be launched into the manner in which diplomatic passports had been issued during the previous regime to non-diplomats.
Minister Amaratunga told the Daily Mirror that he would obtain the list of individuals to whom diplomatic passports had been issued during the previous regime and check them against the regulations in circulars detailing the eligibility for a ?light red passport?.
?From time to time, circulars have been revised and additional people had been granted diplomatic passports under varying categories. However, I will ensure that such cases will be checked to see whether they fell into the specific categories and whether the necessary requirements had been fullfilled,? he said.
The Minister also said if any individual was found to be in possession of a diplomatic passport without fulfilling the necessary requirements, measures would be taken to cancel them and take appropriate action against them.
Last year, Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam as an Opposition MP revealed in parliament that some 2,872 diplomatic passports had been issued by the Department of Immigration and Emigration to various individuals regardless of the ?exclusivity of a list of pre-approved personalities? during a period of nine years since 2005.
He listed out the individuals along with their passport numbers to which included housewives, photographers, merchants, cooks, designers, media secretaries and students.
Responding to these allegations however, the Department of Immigration and Emigration then said that the relevant circulars had been followed in issuing the diplomatic passports.? (Lakna Paranamanna)

SL mother killed in hit and run in London
	
		 		 
		 
			
.A mother-of-two who died in a hit and run crash fled Sri Lanka?s civil war eight years ago and had only recently been reunited with her husband and daughter in London.
Subahari Sothilingam, 44, was struck by a silver C-class Mercedes outside her home in Hendon on her way to work at 6am yesterday.
She suffered multiple head injuries and died in hospital shortly afterwards.
Mrs Sothilingam, a caterer, moved to London in 2006 at the height of the Government clampdown against Tamils in her island homeland.
Her husband Sothilingam Selathurai stayed behind while their two children completed their education.
Mr Selathurai, 44, and their daughter Hamsana, 18, came to the capital in October. Their son Vasanth, 22, is still in Sri Lanka finishing his computer science studies.
The car was on the stretch of the A5 in West Hendon when it hit Mrs Sothilingam as she crossed the busy road to catch a bus to Royal Park.
The car did not stop and drove off towards Edgware Road and the North Circular.
Her husband, who does not speak English, told the Standard today of his family?s devastation.
Speaking through a relative, he said: ?There is nothing that can be done now, it?s all finished. I left her for eight years when she came to England and joined her five months ago.
?It was always her dream for us to all be together.?
The couple met in 1992 while still at school in Hatton, in southern Sri Lanka, and was together for 14 years before Mrs Sothilingam travelled to the UK to join relatives in London.
Her husband added: ?We were together from school, she was my sweetheart. It was a very loving marriage. Even for eight years we were apart, we were in love.?
Her niece Paarkavi Jegatheeswaran, 21, said: ?My aunt was a family-orientated person and she was very talkative. She was very popular and well-liked.
?We are a close family and she was always checking on us to make sure we were okay. She was always happiest surrounded by her family.
?She was on the way to work when she was hit. It?s the same route she?s taken every working day for the last few years. It was completely normal for her to go to work at that time and has made the journey so many times.?
Neighbours in Hendon West Broadway said the road was closed for several hours. Debris from the front of the car was found lying in the road several hundred yards away by investigators.
A man in his forties, who would not be named, said: ?The lady was lying in the road and then the ambulance turned up soon afterwards. I counted 10 police cars.?
Police today appealed for witnesses to come forward.
Detective Sergeant Stephen Pidgeon said: ?There were a number of people who may have witnessed the events in the lead up to the collision or the actual collision itself. If anyone does have any information I urge them to come forward and help us with our investigation.?
A 26-year-old man handed himself in to police last night and was arrested on suspicion of causing death by dangerous by driving and failing to stop at the scene of an accident. He was bailed until April. (London Evening Standard)

SL won't allow repeat of Chinese submarine visits: Mangala
	
		Sri Lanka's new Foreign Minister Mangala Samaraweera has said today in Beijing that the new government will not allow a repeat of last year's visits by a Chinese submarine that had raised concerns in India.
	
	Asked following his two-day visit to Beijing if the new Colombo government would, as ousted President Mahinda Rajapaksa had done, allow Chinese submarines access to Sri Lankan ports, Samaraweera said, "I really don't know under which sort of circumstances that led to some submarines.. to the port of Colombo on the very day the Japanese Prime Minister was visiting Sri Lanka. But we will ensure that such incidents, from whatever quarter, do not happen during our tenure."
	Samaraweera held talks with Chinese Premier Li Keqiang and Foreign Minister Wang Yi during his visit.
	The focus of his talks was to lay the groundwork for new Sri Lankan President Maithripala Sirisena visit to China starting March 26 - his second overseas tour following his February visit to India.
	Samaraweera said the new government would bring Sri Lanka's foreign policy 'back to the centre' and make it more balanced, but rejected suggestions that this meant diluting the close ties Rajapaksa built with China.
	"Back to the centre I don't think has any bearing on Sri Lanka China relations. It will remain as they were, and we will try to strengthen relations with China further in terms of rest of the world," he added. ?(IndiaToday)?
