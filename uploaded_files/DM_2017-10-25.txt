A query that stumped him
	

A heated exchange between two top cops that narrowly stopped short of fisticuffs witnessed at a high-end city hotel the other day has created a sensation in political circles. A powerful purohita in yahapalanaya was the cause for their verbal duel, they say.

One of the khaki duo involved in this affair was a top one from an undercover investigative arm and the other was a character of similar status from the intelligence arm. The twosome was somewhat loaded when they got drawn into a discussion on their onerous duties and the difficulties they were facing about wrapping up some important highly sensitive cases. The top sleuthhound had suddenly flared up when his intelligence counterpart pointed out that the probes into the charges against certain big guns of the previous regimes were grinding too slowly and that they all had to share the blame. Why do you overlook how much I have sweated to finalize the cases I have already filed he had angrily demanded.
Not to be outdone, the other one queried the other why he was sitting on the case of the sensational murder of the newspaper editor when there was sufficient evidence to institute legal action. Arent you dilly-dallying on the case because that Lokka is keen on shielding the accused
The sleuthhound appeared stumped for words. He looked daggers at the intelligence cop and walked out saying, that he would give a reply at the proper time.

Another ploy to further delay the polls
	

The purohita handling the subject of provincial and local government administration and the tough talking Red party leader had been seen holding a kasu-kusu round in a corner of the Diyawanna council the other day.

It later transpired that the duo was discussing the moves being made by some yahapalanaya big guns to postpone the punchi poll for a further period.
The duo had agreed that Purohita Mano was only doing the bidding of his masters when he a threw a spanner into the works by raising a question about the demarcations in respect of several local bodies, they say.

This interpreter in the Diyawanna council, a holder of an executive position as well, has become a veritable nuisance to the young fair ones working under him, they say.

The man is said to be harassing the fair ones who repel his amorous advances. Meanwhile, he has made it a practice to get the young maids, who regularly clean up the place - mopping, sweeping-off cobwebs etc. to do the work from elevated positions, they say.
The complaints made to the higher authorities against him, have so far failed to produce any salutary effect, say the employees.

ComBank affirmed Strongest Bank in Sri Lanka in 2017
	

The Commercial Bank of Ceylon PLC has emerged the Strongest Bank in Sri Lanka in 2017, according to the Asian Banker magazine, and has once again been ranked among the 500 strongest banks in the Asia Pacific region on Balance Sheet evaluation.
Presenting the coveted accolade to Commercial Bank on the side-lines of the annual SIBOS Convention in Toronto, Canada, Asian Banker said: The bank had strong liquidity and capital adequacy ratios, which demonstrated a sustainable balance sheet for the financial year as compared to other banks in the country. With a strength score of 3.08, Commercial Bank of Ceylon holds the top spot for the banks in Sri Lanka.
The Asian Banker award is based on a detailed and transparent scorecard compiled and analysed after an independent assessment of six areas of balance sheet financial performance  the ability to scale, balance sheet growth, risk profile, profitability, asset quality
and liquidity.
The Asian Banker 2017 ranking of the 500 strongest banks in the Asia Pacific region includes banking giants such as Bank of China (Hong Kong) which topped the ranking, Industrial & Commercial Bank of China (Macau), HSBC, Bank of Taiwan, Hang Seng Bank, OCBC Bank (Singapore), Standard Chartered Bank (Hong Kong) China Construction Bank Corporation, Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group (Japan), and DBS
Group (Singapore).
Commenting on this latest international ranking accorded to the bank, Commercial Banks Managing Director/CEO Jegan Durairatnam said: This award is an important independent affirmation of our ability to maintain our core strengths despite challenges. Asian Banker has also stressed the point this year that we have performed well despite substantial pressure on banks in the region to maintain profitability.
In its own assessment of the rankings, Asian Banker noted that in general, the Asia Pacific banking sector delivered better results in this years The Asian Banker 500 (AB500) Strongest Banks by Balance Sheet evaluation, which it said is the most comprehensive annual evaluation that captures the quality and sustainability of the balance sheets of the banks in the region. The magazine however observed that Despite the strength of their balance sheets, Asia Pacific banks continue to face massive challenges in growing profits, a conundrum created by modern capital rules.
The Asian Banker has been publishing its annual ranking of the Strongest Banks in the Asia Pacific region on the basis of balance sheet strength since 2007. The assessment ranks the top performing banks in each country by strength, an evaluation that is based on a belief that a strong bank demonstrates long-term profitability from its core businesses.

EPDP leader wants new Pradeshiya Sabhas in N-E
	
Amid calls for early local government elections, EPDP leader and MP, Douglas Devananda requested Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe yesterday to set up new pradeshiya sabhas and upgrade the status of many other existing local authorities in the North.
He said he was making this request in the context of the government deciding to set up new local authorities in the Nuwara-Eliya district.
In his letter to the Prime Minister and copied to Provincial Councils and Local Government Minister Faizer Mustapha, Mr. Devananda said the absence of pradeshiya sabhas in the four divisional secretariats of Maruthankeni (Jaffna District), Kandawalai (Kilinochchi District), Oddichuddan (Mullaitivu District) and Madhu (Mannar District) had hampered the day to day work connected to public markets, solid waste collection and disposal and the provision of other facilities to the people
I request to give urban council status to the towns such as Killinochchi, Mullaitivu, Manipay, Chunnakam, Chankanai and Nelliady. You are aware that the Killinochchi town is a big urban area stretching nearly four kilometres from Paranthan to Murukandi on A9 and it is administered by the Karachchi Pradesiya Sabha which does not have the necessary capacity to attend to the Kilinochchi urban requirements. Karachchi Pradesha Sabha is also administering Kandawala DS area. It is a matter of fact that the Killinochchi town had enjoyed town council status prior to 1991, his letter to the Premier said.
Mullaitivu town is also the main administrative centre for the whole district and had enjoyed town council status prior to 1991. The absence of urban council status is greatly affecting the development and service provisions of the people.
Besides, he asked for upgrading of the Vavuniya Urban Council to the status of Municipal Council.
He asked the Prime Minister to consider upgrading Trincomalee to a Municipal Council and Chenkalady, Kaluwanchikudi, Kinniya and Mutur to urban councils in the Eastern Province.
Koralaipattu Central and Koralaipattu (Valaichchenai) divisional secretariats in the Batticoloa districts are without separate Pradeshiya Sabhas. The absence of separate pradeshiya sabhas has been affecting the day to day local government functions of the two divisions. Please create Pradeshiya Shabas for the above two divisions, Mr. Devananda said. (Kelum Bandara)

Focus on countrys burning issues, not new constitution - Ven. Rathana Thera
	
Parliamentarian Ven. Athuraliye Rathana Thera today said he had opposed the Constitutional Assembly Steering Committee's Interim Report and added that there are several other burning issues in the country that need to be addressed, other than bringing in a new Constitution.
The Thera said that issues related to political prisoners and existing issues in the North and Eastern Provinces after the 30-year war need to be given priority.
Today the government is attempting to sell 45,000 acres of land, including local properties to the international community, companies and businessmen, claiming to settle the loans obtained by the previous government. Land requirement for people has become another burning issue at a national level. Without considering these issues, the government is preparing a new constitution which is not practical, the prelate said.
This government as well as the previous regime did not work towards achieving peace in the country after the war. It should have created livelihoods for the widows in the Northern and Eastern provinces to enhance their lives. The government should have prioritized to address their grievances and economic shortcomings. Instead the Government is marching ahead on a shortsighted political journey. A national policy for the well-being of the people in the North and East is imperative. But the Government is working on a constitution that has no relevance to the problems faced by the country, he said.
According to the new Constitution, merging the Northern and Eastern provinces would lead to racial issues among the people. As such many members of Muslim communities in the East are not in agreement with this proposed constitution.
If the constitution was passed, no other amendments could be instituted as the Parliament would become inactive in the future.
Ven. Rathana Thera said, even the United National Party (UNP) was not in favour of this new Constitution since they did not express their stance clearly. However they did express their views in the interim committee report.
Finally, he said the Constitution should be drafted in accordance with the needs of the people of the country and not according to the whims of other countries. We do not blame the soliciting of international support, but the Constitution should not be drafted according to their requirement, the Thera said. (Chaturanga Pradeep)

Funding agencies must support them better: MS
	
The global financial agencies like the World Bank, IMF, ADB, JAICA and KOICA must be aware of the efforts taken by beneficiary countries to protect their bio diversity, forests and environment when offering financial aid, President Maithripala Sirisena said.
He said donor agencies must grant enhanced financial assistance to those countries which protect the environment and enact legislation to preserve their bio diversity while those who do not must be penalized.
He said this at the inauguration of the 27th session of the Asia-Pacific Forestry Commission at the BMICH yesterday.
The President said the core objective of protecting the forests, air, water resources, trees and plants was to preserve them for the next generation and make the earth habitable to all human beings.
"Attention has been drawn to preserve forest density, protect trees and plants, water and natural resources by the global community at large and by each and every country in particular. The 2016 Paris Agreement brings all nations together for a common cause to combat climate change and it charts a new course in the global climate effort. The Paris Agreements main objective is to mobilize the global community to strengthen the global response to the threat of climate change by maintaining a temperature rise well below two degrees Celsius. The Paris Agreement has been ratified by 168 countries out of 197 including Sri Lanka," he said. When I addressed the 72nd UN General Assembly in New York last month I explained the efforts taken by Sri Lanka to protect its environment, forestry and bio diversity."
The President said priority has been given to convince school students the importance of loving and protecting the environment as a habit and parents and teachers have been instructed to give the name of the child to the tree planted by him or her instead of giving it the scientific name to popularize tree planting among the young generation.
He said Sri Lanka had suffered immensely as a result of climate change with some parts of the country experiencing a drought for one and a half years while other parts of the country were devastated by floods, landslides killing hundreds and displacing thousands.
"But natural disasters are not restricted only to Sri Lanka. Almost all other countries in the world have suffered more due to climate change. That is why we must do our best to make the earth a safe place from ill effects of climate change," the President said.
The five-day session sponsored by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) is attended by delegates from 34 countries of the AsiaPacific region.
The keynote address was given by Tony Simon, Chairman of the Council of the International Argo-Forestry Research while an introduction to the session was given by Deputy Director General of the FAO, Iroto Mitsuki.
The welcome address was made by Conservator of Forests, S.A. Anura Sathurusingha. The vote of thanks was proposed by Thomas Hauger, Senior Forest Officer of FAO. (Sandun A Jayasekera)

Iraq rebuffs US on Shiite militias
	

BAGHDAD AFP Oct23, 2017 
Iraq on Monday rebuffed a US demand that Iranian militias leave the country, insisting that the paramilitary forces which helped it defeat the Islamic State group consist solely of Iraqi nationals. 
Nobody has the right to interfere in Iraqi affairs, the Iraqi cabinet said in a statement, quoting a source close to Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi. 
The fighters of the Hashed (al-Shaabi paramilitary units) are Iraqis who are concerned for their country and have sacrificed for its defence and for its people, it said. 
On Sunday, US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson demanded that Iranian militias leave Iraq. The 60,000-strong Hashed was formed in 2014 after IS seized swathes of northern Iraq, routing government forces. A coalition mostly made up of Iranian-backed militias, it has played a key role in Iraqs successful fightback against the jihadists over the past three years. 
It answers to Iraqs prime minister as commander-in-chief of the Iraqi armed forces, into which it has been integrated by a parliamentary vote. 
Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif has also hit back at Tillersons remarks, saying Iran played a crucial role in the fight against IS both in Iraq and Syria.

Unlike a recent referendum on independence in Catalonia, which sparked a political crisis in Spain, the Italian votes this weekend were legal, but not binding on Rome.
Making clear he had no intention of making a drama out of the twin ballots, Gentiloni said he was ready to discuss how Lombardy and Veneto wanted to proceed.
Here we are talking about how to make Italy work better. We are not calling into question Italy and its unity, Gentiloni said during a visit to an oil refinery close to Venice, the capital of the northeastern Veneto region.
The government is ready to look into the merits of this ... it will be a complex discussion that cant be done in five minutes, he added.

Mastercard opens-up access to Blockchain API  for partner banks and merchants
	
Mastercard announced that it will be opening up access to its Blockchain technology via its API published on Mastercard Developers.
Mastercards Blockchain solution provides a new way for consumers, businesses and banks to transact and is key to the companys strategy to provide payment solutions that meet every need of financial institutions and their end-customers. The Mastercard Blockchain API will be part of the Money 20/20 hackathon in Las Vegas. The company has tested and validated its Blockchain and will initially implement the technology in the business-to-business (B2B) space to address challenges of speed, transparency and costs in cross-border payments. The Mastercard Blockchain technology will complement the companys existing capabilities including virtual cards, Mastercard Send and Vocalink to support all types of cross-border, B2B payment flows  account-based, Blockchain-based and card-based.
There are four key differentiators of the Mastercard Blockchain  privacy, flexibility, scalability, and most importantly, the reach of the companys settlement network.
Privacy  Mastercard Blockchain provides privacy by ensuring that transaction details are shared only amongst the participants of a transaction while maintaining a fully auditable and valid ledger of transactions.
Flexibility  Partners can use the Blockchain APIs in conjunction with a wider suite of Mastercard APIs to create a range of powerful, new applications. Software development kits are available in six different languages to make the APIs even easier to integrate.
Scalability  Mastercard Blockchain is designed for commercial processing speed and extensibility by reaching consensus between a trusted network moderator and network participants. Reach  Mastercard Blockchain is integrated into the companys payment network that includes 22,000 financial institutions to move funds that have been committed on the Blockchain.
By combining Mastercard Blockchain technology with our settlement network and associated network rules, we have created a solution that is safe, secure, auditable and easy to scale, said Mastercard LabsExecutive Vice PresidentKen Moore. When it comes to payments, we want to provide choice and flexibility to our partners where they are able to seamlessly use both our existing and new payment rails based on the needs and requirements of their customers.
Mastercard Blockchain solution has the ability to power secure and seamless non-card payment transactions such as business-to-business payments and trade finance transactions. It also has the ability to power non-payment solutions such as proof of provenance that helps authenticate products across the supply chain.
With this proprietary solution, Mastercard hopes to create new benefits for its partners and make the commerce ecosystem easier, faster and safer. In addition to building a new solution, the company has also filed for over 35 patents in Blockchain and invested in Digital Currency Group, a collaborator that builds, incubates and seeds Bitcoin and Blockchain technology-related companies. It recently joined the Enterprise Ethereum Allianceto explore the possibilities of the Ethereum technology across a wide range of potential use cases, many of them well outside the scope of Mastercards traditional payments environment. In addition, Mastercard is also working on new use cases with startups that are a part of its Start Path
Global programme.

	Exposure to mercury, even small amounts may cause serious health problems, and is a threat to the development of the child in womb and early in life. 
	Mercury may have toxic effects on the nervous, digestive and immune systems, and on lungs, kidneys, skin and eyes. 
	Mercury is considered by World Health Organization (WHO) as one of the top ten chemicals or groups of chemicals of major public health concern. 
	Mercury exists in various forms; elemental (or metallic) and inorganic. 
Various cosmetic products are available in abundance in the market, but proper standards arent being maintained. Its reported that some imported and non-regulated cosmetics are in the market and they contain Mercury, where the quantities used surpass the permitted limit. When scrutinizing these products neither the importer nor distributor is mentioned. Therefore, we have to be extra cautious when using cosmetics. 
Consultant Gynaecological Oncologist at the Maharagama National Cancer Institute, Dr. Sarada Kannangara told Daily Mirror that cosmetics, which contain dangerous substances, had captured the local market, during the past two years, due to the lack of pertinent laws that regulate such products. 
Dr. Kannangara said that clause 27 of the 1990 Medicine Act had been annulled in 2015 and a new Act was introduced, but it doesnt contain sufficient provisions to regulate the import of cosmetics, leaving room for the import of low quality products. 
A wide range of low quality cosmetics is available under various brands. Several deaths have been reported as a result of allergic reactions to these products, Dr. Kannangara affirmed. 
He further said that most cosmetics contained mercury above the recommended limit to produce instant results. Dr. Kannangara added that these products often contributed to health hazards such as skin cancer.

But, we have noticed that cosmetic manufacturers have exceeded these specifications, hence their users face severe consequences

The consequences of applying these toxic cosmetics are as follows, 
Numbness or pain in certain parts of the skin 
	Uncontrollable shaking or tremor 
	Inability to walk well 
	Blindness and double vision 
	Memory problems 
	Seizures and death (with large exposures) 
	Irritability and shyness 
The above mentioned repercussions are the most common symptoms when using products made without adhering to safety regulations. We also get to hear of cosmetic users having being subject to hidden fatal infections and allergies, which are incurable. 
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), warns customers not to use products if the ingredients or the label arent displayed on the products. 
As Federal Law requires that ingredients be listed on the label of any cosmetic or non-prescription drug, dont use products that dont have a label. In addition, dont use drugs or cosmetics labelled in languages other than English unless English labelling is also provided. Thats also a sign that the product may be marketed illegally, the official site of the FDA states. 
A prominent question raised is how a customer can know whether mercury has been used in a cosmetic product, especially in one that is marketed under the category anti-aging or skin lightening Check the label. If the words mercurous chloride, calomel, mercuric, mercurio, or mercury are mentioned on the label, it means mercury has been included. A customer is advised to stop using such products immediately. 
The products are usually marketed as skin lighteners, ones that promote anti-aging and those that remove age spots, freckles, blemishes and wrinkles. Adolescents often use these products for acne treatment. Just because a product claims to be natural it doesnt necessarily ensure safety as well. And also just because a product claims to be natural it doesnt rule out the possibility of hidden drugs being used. 
Furthermore, these products may also be contaminated or may include potentially harmful chemicals or drugs, not listed on the label. For example many products that promise to help people slim contain hidden and dangerous drugs (Issued only under prescriptions) such as sibutramine.

Jason Humbert from FDAs Office of Regulatory Affairs says these products are usually manufactured abroad and sold illegally in the USA, often in shops catering to the Latino, Asian, African, or Middle Eastern communities. They are promoted online on social media sites and sold through mobile apps. Consumers may have purchased them from another country and brought them back to their respective countries. 
It is vital to inform your health care professional what supplements you are taking, because supplements may interact in a harmful way with prescribed medications or prevent a prescribed drug from working. 
During the past few years, FDA and state health officials have discovered numerous products that contain mercury. There have been cases where people exposed to such products have had mercury poisoning or elevated levels of mercury in their bodies.
Its important to use products that will help your skin and not damage it. People should avoid using skin creams, beauty antiseptic soaps and lotions that contain mercury irrespective of the temporary results they produce.

SL security delegation to visit Lahore
	
A delegation from Sri Lanka will visit Lahore today to inspect the security arrangements for the lone Twenty20 match scheduled for October 29 before giving final clearance for the Island nation's tour to Pakistan, the Nation (Pakistan) reported.
Sri Lanka Cricket is determined to send its team to Pakistan and its president has insisted that his team will play in Lahore despite the pullout of some key players for the lone Twenty20 match.
In response to the refusal by their key players to play the match in Lahore, the SLC and selectors have picked a new look but depleted squad for all three T20 matches, two of which will be held in Dubai before the team flies to Lahore for a day.
The Sri Lankan security delegation during their visit will be given detailed briefings on the arrangements and shown dress rehearsals by the concerned security officials in Lahore. The delegation will also visit the team hotel and ground to see all arrangements beforehand before they report back to their board and the government after which clearance will be given to the Sri Lankan team to fly from Dubai to Lahore.
The Sri Lankan delegation is also expected to given a detailed briefing on Lahore safe city project at its office in Qurban Lines, where the delegation will be able to see the live footage of all the routes and the venue.
The Sri Lankan team's visit is seen as very significant by the PCB and fans as it was after militants attacked the Sri Lankan team in Lahore in March, 2009 that international teams stopped visiting Pakistan because of security concerns.
"Even if they are coming for just one match but it's significance is enormous because they were the ones who came under attack and if their board and government shows confidence in us to send their team, it will send a positive message to other boards as well," PCBs media director Amjad Hussain Bhatti said.
Bhatti said the recently-held series against World XI was of great advantage for both the Board and security agencies as it was easier for them to replicate the same arrangements and focusing more on the minor details as well.
Due to its significance and symbolic nature of the event, Bhatti said, the Sri Lankan tour is even more important for Pakistan as the PCB is hosting a team who was a direct victim of the terror attack in 2009.
He said all the arrangements has been almost finalised and the liaison between all the concerned departments has been agreed upon and hoped that the PCB and all other security agencies would make the event aa memorable one for all the right reasons.
Tickets for the October 29 match are already on sale and there has been a big demand from fans for the match to be played at the Gaddafi Stadium.

SLFP against new Constitution, agrees only to amendments: Isura
	
The Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) was not only against the report of the Constitutional Steering Committee, it will also reject any Constitutional amendments if SLFP proposals were not taken into consideration, WP Chief Minister Isura Devapriya said today.
He reiterated that the SLFP was anyway against a new Constitution and would only agree to bring in the amendments to the Constitution.
We will act against a new Constitution if it bring proposals to abolished the executive president system. The executive powers of the President should not be curtailed furthermore because it had already been reduced, Chief Minister Devapriya told a press briefing.
He said the SLFP had proposed some proposals to the Interim report and their stance on the executive presidential system would not be changed.
He said the SLFP could only agree with some of the proposals included in the report and against the rest of the proposals.
We were against the merger of two provincials councils. We cant agree to the proposal that the Chief ministers meeting should be held under the patronage of the Prime Minister. The meeting should be held under the patronage of the executive president of the country, he said.
He said a Constitution that can be agreed by all parties should be created.
Commenting on the upcoming local government election, he said it is good if the elections could be held in January.
But I think there might be a problem to hold the election in January because of errors in the election system. Only the Election Commissioner can decide the date of the election, he said. (Darshana Sanjeewa)

Two Betel leaf senior purohitas  both onetime secretarial ones-one from the Colombo district and the other from Kurunegala  had recently called on Number One to tell him on a colleague in the top team.

The duo taking turns told the boss in conspiratorial tones that the colleague in question was quietly planning to bring about a price hike in essential consumer items on the eve of the upcoming local polls at the bidding of an opposition big gun.
Number One convinced of the veracity of the information had taken a series of far reaching decisions to counter the treacherous move and teach the scheming purohita an unforgettable lesson, they say.

Worse days are in the offing for the once high-flying Colombo-based Green politico who is now being roundly blamed for tainting the yahapalanaya, they say.

The man now down and out seems to draw hardly any sympathy from any quarter for he had in his hay day rubbed most high-ups from both strands of the unity rule on the wrong side. By the way, reports say that a probe into his assets has already been launched on the instructions of the highest echelons and what they had already uncovered had many an eye popped out with disbelief, they say.
A file containing incriminating evidence relating to a mega deal that the man had clinched with an accomplice from a neighboring small country is said to be now in the possession of a top authority in yahapalanaya.

The survivors of the Titanic pictures hours after tragedy
	
Rare photos depicting the rescue efforts after the sinking of the Titanic are set to go up for auction this week.
The photos are included in the scrapbook of New York socialite Louis M. Ogden, who was sailing to Europe with his wife Agatha in April 1912 when their ship got an emergency call from the Titanic, which had struck an iceberg and was sinking rapidly.
The Carpathia arrived at the scene at daybreak, where they started rescuing the survivors who had waited out the night in lifeboats.
Ogden, a lawyer, had bought a new camera for the trip, which was still a rare thing to own unless you were wealthy.
He took pictures of the rescue - showing lifeboats approaching the ship and being brought on deck - including lifeboat no. 6, which had the now famous Margaret Brown on board. (Daily Mail)

Tuk Tuks  find the bucks,  but lose customer affection
	
The three wheeler taxi business seems to be operating in a wild and uncontrollable manner
We have drivers who operate Tuk Tuks without an iota of knowledge about responsibility
Over 1.3 million Tuk Tuks take to the road in this taxi business, but just 10% of these vehicles is registered with a union
Tuks Tuks have become such a convenient mode of transport that customers have learned to be comfortable with uncomfortable situations when obtaining the services of these taxis. 
Aggressive driving on the roads, swearing and sometimes a touch of recklessness thrown into the ride makes customers think whether this industry needs a proper monitoring system. 
Tuk Tuk commuters werent really over the moon when the Government announced yet again that all three wheeler taxis have to comply with the regulation introduced by the Transport Ministry to display details of the taxi service on the vehicle. Just a month ago we also heard the news that the Government would make it compulsory for three wheeled taxis to install a meter. 
Despite all these efforts the three wheeler taxi business seems to be operating in a wild and uncontrollable manner. In a way the easy path that a person can take to become a driver of a three wheeler taxi should remain unchanged. Everyone cant become academics nor doctors. As much as business establishments connected to the medical profession need patients, the companies that manufacture these Tuk Tuks wish to see enough drivers who are willing to take to this profession. 
However, the problem seems to be that we have drivers who operate Tuk Tuks without an iota of knowledge about responsibility, courtesy and even ethics that govern good driving. 
In the chaos of our daily lives and during the errands that we run on, we might come across cultured drivers who make the Tuk Tuk ride so pleasant. This dearth of good three wheeler taxi drivers is perhaps one reason why someone took the effort to put the post titled The ultimate Tuk Tuk survival guide in Sri Lanka on the internet. In the article the writer suggests commuters to inquire whether there is a meter, agree on a price in the absence of a meter, inquire from locals about the going rate for hires and if the driver is good save his number. 
For the record over 1.3 million Tuk Tuks take to the road in this taxi business, but just 10% of these vehicles is registered with a union. To the disadvantage of Tuk Tuk drivers there are far too many associations that are trying to regulate the three wheeler taxi industry. But the truth that lies beneath their efforts indicates that all this amounts to a power struggle between existing three wheeler associations. The public will still vouch for the fact that an association that can take full responsibility if a customer is dissatisfied is yet to be established. 
Three wheeler taxis came into being about 38 years ago. People welcomed their arrival because the hiring cars that operated before that charged customers excessively. People started moving faster to their destinations. They also saw their expenses incurred regarding such travels dropping by more than half with the advent of three wheeler taxis. 
As the Tuk Tuks offering taxi service mushroomed, and following complaints by customers, who were charged excessively, the meter was introduced to this business in 2005. Voices of descent echoed, being a Sri Lanan habit. The islanders have this habit of kicking against any law or regulation thats introduced to ensure there is order in a business or in the day to lives of the people. 
The drivers who love change and can adopt to change installed meters and saw their hires boom. More private companies acquired existing Tuk Tuks or bought new ones. In no time obtaining the services of a three wheeler taxi could be done with a mere call or the click of a few buttons on ones mobile phone. Contrary to the grumbling three wheeler taxi drivers we now have well-dressed drivers arriving in Tuk Tuks to take us to our destinations. 
While most companies offering this taxi service have registered networks and operate with the aid of apps via sms alerts, there are others who thought beyond. Some businessman, inclined towards promoting tourism and making money through this industry, refurbished their three wheeler taxis with retro fitted convertibles and offered Tuk Tuk Safaris. Customers were offered bottles of water, snacks, tissue and our very own king coconuts to keep them happy and make their journeys in the Tuk Tuks memorable. Most importantly the owner of this service, during a newspaper interview, highlighted not the luxuries this service offers, but something it lacks. Though our drivers might not speak a foreign language they make up for it with a friendly attitude, were his positive words. In this context it seems a good time to recall an old Chinese proverb A man without a smile on his face should never open a shop. Even if it is a taxi service, compromises should never be made regarding customer satisfaction. 
In present times the Western Province Road Passenger Transport Authority reenacting Gazette Notification of 2013 (1834/27) mandates all Tuk Tuks to use a meter. Those who obtained a meter will receive a permit which can be renewed annually. 
All these regulations will also bid goodbye to the old camaraderie which once existed between three wheeler driver and customer. We have heard of tales from the past when three wheeler drivers gave hires for free when they knew that a regular customer was stranded on the road without finances. There have also been times when three wheeler drivers have come to the rescue of customers, who got mugged, just after disembarking from the Tuk Tuk. This is because three wheeler drivers were alert and had time to kill after finishing a hire. The rat race that exists after all these regulations and the booming Tuk Tuk taxi business might make drivers behave like robots or programmed individuals, even going to the extent of being heartless and thoughtless. If this is where the rest of the world is heading, making the Tuk Tuk driver stop and consider to retain some of his humane qualities looks impossible now. This is because the taste of money is so addictive. 
The Gune Ayyas and Sumane Ayyas might hang up the keys of their three wheeler taxis and take to some others profession because they cant adopt to the digital revolutions in the taxi business. But it must be noted with interest how one IT professional from Sri Lanka, who was employed in America, told this newspaper that his visiting card contained details of him being a Uber taxi driver. The IT professional affirmed that driving a taxi in the US wasnt considered as a second class job and that this occupation was pursued by many undergraduates to earn some extra money.

It was raining heavily the other day and this writer had taken shelter under the cover of a bus halt when a three wheeler taxi pulled over. A stout lady (Seemingly a Muslim) disembarked and paid the driver, who in turn blessed the lady by saying Budu Saranai (May the tripple Gem Bless you). The driver even told the customer not to get wet in the rain. This kind of talk might soon be lost language and be out of use like the old hiring cars!

Unwanted debates attempting to suppress burning issues: JVP
	
The topic of the new Constitution had been brought up in an attempt to sweep burning issues within the country under the carpet, the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) said today.
Addressing a press briefing, JVP General Secretary Tilvin Silva said the rising dialogue had become beneficial to the government, and it was created by a bankrupt political party who lost power.
Although there was an actual need for a new constitution that could safeguard the peoples rights, Mr. Silva said this unwanted dialogue had been created even before any draft on the new constitution had been prepared.
A debate had been brought up when there was no new Constitution or draft presented to the Parliament. Some groups feared that the country would separate soon because of the new Constitution. We can debate once the draft is prepared, and until then everyone could submit proposals to make a new Constitution, he said.
He also said that everyone has a right to voice their own opinions on the new Constitution. However it should have to be passed through a referendum through which the people can decide the need for such a Constitution.
He said President Maithripala Sirisena has no right to contest for the Presidential election again and if he did so the JVP would defeat him and abolish the Executive Presidency. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

Xi joins Mao in Communist constitution, tightening grip on China
	

Chinese leader Xi Jinping was elevated to the pantheon of the countrys greatest leaders Tuesday as his name was enshrined in the Communist Party constitution alongside Chairman Mao.
 
The inclusion of Xis eponymous guiding philosophy for the nation cements his place as the most powerful Chinese leader in decades and suggests he could remain its paramount leader throughout his lifetime. 
Communist Chinas founder Mao Zedong, and the architect of market reforms, Deng Xiaoping, are the only other Chinese leaders to have their names in the document --and only Mao was alive when his was included. 
Xi, 64, presided over the week-long congresss closing session where some 2,300 delegates approved the constitutional amendment to include Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era. 
Xi also got two of his cherished programmes written into the constitution: an anti-corruption campaign that has brought down 1.5 million crooked officials since 2012 and the Belt and Road initiative, the massive global trade infrastructure project intended to increase the countrys
influence abroad. 
The concept places a heavy emphasis on the partys role in governing every aspect of the country from the economy to what people are writing on social media. 
With his name in the constitution, Xi will have the last word on all political matters and could stay on as the nations top leader even if he gives up the title of general secretary when his second term ends in 2022, analysts said.
