TNA should leave  Sri Lankan ruling class to solve the crisis!
	
Deepavali is observed by Hindus that symbolizes victory of Light over Darkness, hope over despair, but today as the ruling class continues with its pre-colonial feudal system of rule of keeping a distance between the rulers and the ruled with us and them feeling.
Also today many Sri Lankans venerate late Ven. Maduluwawe Sobitha Thera, the influential Buddhist monk who passed away this day three years ago on November 6, 2015, who aided the wind of change in 2015 to put the Unity Government to change the way country was ruled, yet there is no hope for the Sri Lankan ruled class that includes Hindus. Regrettably, with the loss of this true nonviolent revolutionary monk respected by all communities, there was nobody to guide the ruling class to produce the desired results. Perhaps if the monk had lived longer, respecting the diversity of a multi-class, multi-ethnic and multi-religious society the change might have happened and certainly would have prevented the present constitutional crisis. Perhaps the country is not ready for a change yet, with the insistence of the Sri Lankan rulers to maintain the unitary status undermining fundamental rights of all the minorities. Not surprisingly the ruled class expressed their disappointment clearly at the 2018 Local Government polls to rock the foundation of the unity government and its ruling class leaders mindful of the concerns of the people, reacted separately.
While the rejected regime interpreted the results as their victory and are attempting to take control of the government with the help of a few turncoat legislators when parliament reconvenes next week. The Tamil National Alliance (TNA), having expressed its willingness for a political solution within a united country should request the future government to resolve some of the basic issues of their people in exchange for their support, failing that should take a neutral stance and leave it to the ruling class to resolve their crisis.
Bitter truth is this crisis will end when the House resumes its sessions with new rulers, but not the problems of the majority poor people being ruled; to them the past or the present government makes no difference as both are from the corrupt pool of legislators belonging to same ruling class. A proper weeding out that was stressed many times in Northern Breeze is the best option available to the majority poor people at the General Elections due in 2020 to clean up the poor administration at the centre. Weeding out from the ruling class all dishonest common men turned politicians regardless of which political party they belong to and replace them by voting in many new law makers to any political party of their choice to govern the country and get the country out of its present mess.

UNP exploring possibility of ousting President: Harin
	
The United National Party (UNP) will explore the possibility of removing President Maithripala Sirinsena in conformity with Article 38 (2) of the Constitution, the partys media spokesman Harin Fernando said today.
Article 38(2) says,  Any Member of Parliament may, by a writing addressed to the Speaker, give notice of a resolution alleging that the President is permanently incapable of discharging the functions of his office by reason of mental or physical infirmity or that the President has been guilty of intentional violation of the Constitution, treason, bribery, misconduct or corruption involving the abuse of the powers of his office, or any offence under any law, involving moral turpitude and setting out full particulars of the allegation or allegations made and seeking an inquiry and report thereon by the Supreme Court.
Mr. Fernando said that, We feel that President Sirisena neither is nor fit to hold his post considering the way he believes and acts and therefore we are focusing on removing him under the article 38(2) of the constitution.(Yohan Perera)

Minister Dissanayakepointed out that the TNA had disintegrated to four groups and the SLMC and ACMC had also problems. As such the UNP could not expect the support of all members of these minority parties, he said.
Responding to a journalist on his failed attempt to rope in UNP MPRange Bandara by offering him a cabinet position, Minister Dissanayakesaid he has talked to many UNP members and will continue to do so until the 14th.
He said Mr. Bandara had earlier agreed to accept Rs. 200 million but later come down to Rs. 80 million and added offering a ministerial portfolio to get his support was not a bribe. (Sandun A Jyasekera)

There was a time in Sri Lanka when the elite and the poorest of poor steered clear of politics. These two segments of the society couldnt be influenced by the agenda of others and the secret of their stability in thinking was the fact that they had formed contentment in life. But the elite have changed now and members from this section of the society feel the need to stand up and throw their weight behind moves that support democracy and human rights in the field of politics.

Politicians have always preyed on the middle class and forced them or lured them into taking to politics or doing the dirty work for them. But even in this segment of the society there are changes which augurs well for the future. A son of an SLFPer might team up with an UNPer, a chain-smokers son might never touch a cigarette, a farmers son might see better prospects outside the paddy field and a Mahinda Rajapaksa fan might see a better future for the country in the event there is a better organised UNP. However, politicians are not fans of change when people change for the better.

Speaker Karu Jayasuriya claiming that he is compelled to accept the status quo prior to October 26 has the effect of oxygen on democratic forces in the island who are gasping for fresh air

Which is the correct way to live
The present political crisis in Sri Lanka has brought the elite and the middle class to a platform where there is a debate now going on as to what is good for Sri Lanka. A privileged Buddhist monk in the island said recently on television that he fancied foreign forces imposing sanctions on Sri Lanka because that would make the countrys citizens work harder. Many who support the opinion of the priest dont give a damn to what image Sri Lanka builds within the international community and the repercussions that follow. Cardinal Malcolm Ranjith came under fire recently for making the statement that there is no need for human rights if the people live in a correct manner. There seems to be much confusion about what is the correct way to live given that Sri Lanka is a multiethnic and multicultural country.
President Sirisena thinks it was right in sacking Ranil Wickremesinghe as Premier and appointing Mahinda Rajapaksa to fill the void. This move earned the wrath of academics, a large section of the middleclass and most importantly almost the entire international community. The only country to congratulate Sri Lankas new premier was the islands business partner China. Isnt this enough indication that Sri Lanka is on the path once again to isolate itself from the worlds developed countries; like during the Rajapaksa regime
The worlds democratic forces are urging Sri Lanka to reconvene Parliament. This could be one of the reasons why President Sirisena issued a proclamation to reconvene parliament on November 14. According to sources the UNP can still muster the support in Parliament to bring a no-confidence motion against the new Premier Rajapaksa. What people of this country have to be concerned about is the unpredictable nature of Sirisena. The u-turns he has made in his political career make us view him with skepticism!
Just now we are celebrating Dewali, but there is only a faint light all-round in the country in the presence of the chaos caused by the unhealthy political situation. By next month well be getting ready for Christmas followed by the ushering in of a new year, in January. December is the month for analysing; a time to look back and see whether we gained or lost. One thing is for sure; our politicians have gained so much at the expense of the voters (the people).

According to sources the UNP can still muster the support in Parliament to bring a no-confidence motion against the new Premier Rajapaksa.

On Monday (October 5) the support rally backing Rajapaksa and held at Parliament round about drew large crowds. UNP critics point out that Rajapaksa can still draw larger crowds than Wickremesinghe at a political rally. Canteen owners and tuk tuk taxi drivers slashed their prices in support of Rajapaksa being sworn in as prime minister. Even the trees along Parliament Road are greener these days, thanks to the showers which we receive in abundance. Everything from the trees to the small man on this road seems to greet this man called Rajapaksa, who has got another lifeline in politics after he was voted out in 2015. But whether he has the same support in his second home, the Parliament, is left to be seen. Many feel that the chances of the scale now tilting in Rajapaksas favour are slim because the JVP, the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress and TNA teaming up to support democracy and fair play will once again make Wickremesinghe the winner by default. If one looks back, Wickremesinghe has never sweated for the premiers post and has been presented with this portfolio on a platter.

Momentum of social media
The TNA reps, like all the right thinking citizens of this country, have voiced that remaining neutral at this juncture would pave the way to achieve whats undemocratic by force. President Sirisena chairing an SLFP Central Committee meeting has requested party members to cooperate with him to form a stable Government. Anyone supporting anything thats Sirisena from now on would endorse all the wrong decisions taken by this man. Speaker Karu Jayasuriya claiming that he is compelled to accept the status quo prior to October 26 has the effect of oxygen on democratic forces in the island who are gasping for fresh air.
The debate whether Sirisena is to blame or whether Ranil buckled the plans for the country has gathered momentum on social media. One recent post said, Ranil is not an option, Mahinda is a chance. This writer opines that only women ask men to take their chance on them in the context of marriage. This system doesnt work in politics. Many liken the Wickremesinghe- Sirisena affair to a marriage that never clicked. Wickremesinghes sophisticated thinking and Sirsenas nature to place his feet on the ground and walk along with the common man caused a gulf between the two which later triggered a political tsunami.
Sirisena at Mondays rally said that the countrys decisions were taken by Wickremesinghe and his flutter of butterflies; taking swipe at the ousted premiers allies engaged in politics. Three years ago he saw much fault in Rajapaksa and called him a dictator. How this man changes his opinion like this questions the decision taken by those who proposed him as the common candidate at the presidential elections in 2015.

Many feel that the chances of the scale now tilting in Rajapaksas favour are slim because the JVP, the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress and TNA teaming up to support democracy and fair play

Sirisena revealing he first made the offer to Karu Jayasuriya and then to Sajith Premadasa to be the Premier and adding that the duo turned down these requests confirms that the UNPers saw what was wrong as wrong rather than as opportunities. UNP national organiser Navin Dissanayake said the other day that people must stand together for a democratic and disciplined country.
If this country lacks anything its discipline. The road that leads to Parliament from the road-about close-by will be all green and luscious and might even bloom with flowers. But whether the Parliamentarians who travel on this road will have large hearts that release the fragrance of flowers is left to be desired!

Willing to work with President: Ranil
	
UNP Leader Ranil Wickremesinghe has said he is willing to work with President Maithripala Sirisena if, given a chance to prove his majority in Parliament, the Hindu reported today.
On whether he could still work with the President, Mr. Wickremesinghe said: Ill have no problem working with him, thats a question you must ask him. The Constitution doesnt make provision for personal prejudices, he said on Tuesday in an interview to The Hindu at Temple Trees.
Amid the persisting political crisis, Mr. Wickremesinghe is optimistic about an early recall of Parliament.
The Parliaments power is supreme and that is what the Speaker has upheld, he said, referring to Speaker Karu Jayasuriyas statement on Monday, noting that Mr. Rajapaksa will not be recognised as PM until he wins a floor test.
I am confident of having the numbers, Mr. Wickremesinghe said, adding: The fact that they are delaying the recall is because they dont have the numbers.
Mr. Sirisena, who earlier suspended Parliament until November 16, has recalled the House for November 14. The delay worries me because it makes the country more unstable, the ousted PM said.
Mr. Wikremesinghehas ruled out a court appeal on the matter, citing the Parliaments supreme judicial powers. Reiterating the position, he said: Even if you go to court they will send you back to parliament on this matter. We are different from yours [Indian context].
On his strategy to stabilise to the country, should he prove his majority, Mr. Wickremesinghe said the cabinet might have to be reconstituted because some had left it, and joined the new cabinet that Mr. Sirisena has sworn in. But the Speaker has very well said the status quo of [last] Friday stands. Unless they prove a majority that stands.
Asked what if Mr. Rajapaksa won the floor test Mr. Wickremesinghe, even before the question was completed, said: He wont be able to prove a majority. Pressed again for a response to such a hypothetical scenario, he said: I dont know about hypothesis, I am talking about the actual situation. He does not have the numbers.

Kolbie (centre) with the happy couple

When Texan woman Kolbie Sanders, 24, called off her wedding at the last minute, she decided that instead of wasting her venue she would donate it to another couple. With only six days until the planned date of the wedding, Kolbie put it out on Facebook that she was looking to donate her wedding venue. With my engagement ending, Ive come to find tremendous peace in knowing that I did the right thing for both of us. With that being said, now I want to do the right thing by others and let some good come out of this decision, Sanders wrote on October 14. This is a long shot but since my wedding venue has been paid for in full already, I have decided to donate my venue valued at $3,500 to a couple to use for their wedding day! she added.
Kolbie then asked people to send her a private message with a brief history of their relationship. The post went viral with local businesses also getting involved offering services for free including photography, food and beauty packages. Out of the hundreds of messages Kolbie received, she eventually chose Hailie Hipsher, whose wedding was planned for next year but with a grandfather diagnosed with Stage 4 cancer, she was unsure if he would make it to see her walk down the aisle.
When I chose her name, I was really excited, Sanders told The Washington Post. I immediately remembered her story, so I was really happy for her.

CPC shooting: Arjuna says image tarnished by false news
	
While saying that he was aware of the incident that occurred at the fourth floor of the CEYPETCO House on October 28, former Petroleum Minister Arjuna Ranatunga claimed that spreading of false news relating to the incident had tarnished his and his familys image.
After showing CCTV footage at a media briefing in Colombo today he said the people who were involved in the incident were roaming free and the person who tried to save his life was imprisoned.
Kulatissa Deeganage, a member of the Colombo Municipal Council had made statements to the media that I had assaulted him and ordered my MSD security guard to shoot at him"
Even Bandula Saman Kumara, who claimed to be the Union Leader of the CPC had said the same, the former Minister said.
While displaying a CCTV footage, the former Minister explained what had happened at the CEYPETCO house.
I arrived in the country from London on October 28 morning and I had left my keys to the official residence as a practice at the Petroleum Ministry office at the fourth floor. During my visit, the government had changed and I did not go to my ministry to get my keys to take out my personal belongings from my official residence. There I had informed my additional secretary and waited until he arrived, Minister said.
He alleged that a mob led by Kulatissa Deeganage had entered the CEYPETCO building which the Minister claimed was a high-security area. He said the mob entered the lobby where he waited until his Additional Secretary arrived.
They had an argument with me and started abusing me in filth. When he tried to assault me, my security personnel and MSD men removed him from the lobby area. At the time Kulatissa Deeganage was under the influence of liquor.
Then my security staff sent me to the Communication and Marketing Service room for safety.
After 15 to 20 minutes Kulatissa Deeganage entered the lobby with a group of people with poles, metal bars, cricket bats and bicycle chains. The mob tried to enter the room where I was and assaulted MSD officers trying to enter the room.
One of my MSD officers was beaten severely and he used his gun to disperse the mob and stop beating him. He opened fire. I heard the sounds of gunshots.
Ranatunga said that he saw the mob fleeing the scene
Unfortunately one person was killed and another injured, he said.
After the incident, Kulatissa Deeganage had told several media that I told my MSD officials to shoot. At that time the mob held me hostage in the room for over three hours until the STF succeeded in removing me to safety.
I gave no such order and I was not in a position to do so as I was locked inside the Communication and Marketing Service Room. Another media report was spreading claiming that I had assaulted the Colombo Municipal Councillor, he said.
I am saddened that the MSD man who saved my life is in prison while the rioting mob is roaming freely, he said.
While releasing the CCTV footage I request the media to help recover the damages done to my image and to my family.
During the incident, one person had lost his life and I wish to convey my deepest condolences to the bereaved family, he said.
The Minister further said the intention of the mob was to kill him.
Had it not been for the intervention of my MSD officer, the mob would have killed me. Those who organised this incident and incited the workers should take full responsibility for the tragic loss of life and damage to the Government property, he said. (Chaturanga Samarawickrama)

Women hold up half the sky
-Mao Zedong

Women are mothers. They are wives, daughters, sisters, aunts, grandmothers, cousins and friends, they are people who take care of us, love us and educate us. According to the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) since 2000, Sri Lanka has seen a rise in girls attending school with most regions reaching gender parity in primary education. As part of their Sustainable Development Goals, the UNDP wants to build on these achievements, especially in the workforce, as women still face inequality when it comes to finding employment. Curious about what is being done to support women in Sri Lanka, Mirror For Hope spoke with Niveen Rajabdeen, born in Sri Lanka but having lived in Australia the last 11 years, on what herself and local groups have been doing thats making a difference to the lives of women and girls in Sri Lanka.

I realised there was a lot I could share to help women dig deep to get comfortable in their own skin, dream something up and then go out and make it happen
When I was in my teens, I felt at odds with how I had access to opportunities that some other young women whom Id met along the years didnt  they were people I chatted to working at local shops or at peoples homes or in country villages that I sometimes visited. There seemed to be a general lack of awareness of their potential, and how to identify and access resources and opportunities Niveen explained.
As an Ayurvedic lifestyle consultant and yoga and meditation teacher, Niveens Melbourne based centre Ananda Wellness, has been helping people achieve optimal health, both physically and mentally through lifestyle, diet, massage, meditation and yoga. While Niveen calls Melbourne home, Sri Lanka was always calling her back - the culture, the food and what she calls general Sri Lankanness. Niveen recalls during a trip or two in Sri Lanka last year people started to ask about yoga/meditation classes and learning about Ayurveda and wellness, so I thought it may be a good idea to share my knowledge and get a bit more involved over here.
A collaboration was soon born between Zonta Zone IV in Colombo, the Centre of Hope in Mattakuliya and Niveen to create the first Life Skills and Empowerment Programme for girls aged 12 to 16. I realised there was a lot I could share to help women dig deep to get comfortable in their own skin, dream something up and then go out and make it happen Niveen explained. During the programme the girls learnt about visions and dreams, planning for the future, self-care, anxiety reduction, mindfulness and caring for the community. Many participants have already started a breathing practice and yoga (as a daily routine), as well as planning for the future by focusing on education. Im so excited to see how they carry on their journeys, and so awed by their intelligence, wit, thoughtfulness and incredible energy. 
As well as the Life Skills and Empowerment Programme and yoga and meditation classes, Niveen recently ran an ayurvedic beauty workshop, focusing not only on outward beauty (roopam) but also how to maintain inner health in a sustainable way that is also environmentally friendly. Participants were taught the foundations of Ayurvedic beauty and general doshic tendencies, which can be a new concept to some people. Niveen also ran through simple rituals and routines for the mind and body that can be incorporated into your day to day life as well as a light meditation.
The workshop was rounded off with participants having a hands-on experience making beauty masks from ingredients easily found in the kitchen such as chickpea flour, milk and turmeric. Classes like this give adult women the chance to make new friends, share their stories, as well as learning practical skills they can use in their own wellness journeys. Colombo has a large expat and transient community and through her workshops, Niveen is able to bring women together from different countries, cultures and backgrounds to enjoy a few hours together learning something new.
With her departure date to Australia getting closer, we asked Niveen about her hopes for the future. To continue to pass on as much as I can from the world of Ayurveda, yoga, wellness and mindfulness in a way that is relevant to peoples lives and where healthier choices become easy choices - choices that dont just pertain to diet but also what we ingest emotionally and mentally through our relationships, lifestyles, choices and actions within the community and environment in which we live. This is when a true sense of well-being starts to take shape.
For anyone interested in working with Zonta or Centre For Hope you can find their details on their Facebook pages.

Ex-UNP ministers attempt to mislead public: Susil
	
Some ex-United National Party (UNP) ministers were attempting to mislead the public by proclaiming that the country was leading towards anarchy, Public Administration, Home Affairs and Justice Minister Susil Premajayantha said today.
Addressing a news briefing at the Prime Ministers Office, he said it was during their Government that the country stagnated and remained in anarchy.
Ex-UNP ministers including ousted premier Ranil Wickremesinghe pretend to be genuine and smart before envoys and international community and tell them that Sri Lanka has shifted to the Westminster system from the Presidential system, the Minister said.
He said it was absolutely untrue and added the executive powers vested with the President under the Constitution in 1978 remained unchanged except a few powers which were curtained in the 19th amendment.
We can assure that this Government wont let country lead to anarchy and plunge into chaos as experienced in the previous national government, the Minister added.
He proceeded to say that the newly appointed ministers had been appointed based on scientific method unlike in the previous government. (Sheain Fernandopulle)

## Title: FELIX DIAS BANDARANAIKE:  THE FAMILY MAN!
## Section: News Features

FELIX DIAS BANDARANAIKE:  THE FAMILY MAN!
	
June 16 was a dark and dismal day in the calendar of my aunt Lakshmi and her daughter Christine who lost their beloved husband and loving father quite prematurely. Felix Dias Bandaranaike was 53 years of age. This year, it has been 33 years since the passing away of this remarkable husband, father, friend, uncle and politician. 
There have been numerous articles written about this gentle giant of a great Statesman of an era gone by, truly acknowledging and celebrating his unparalleled integrity, intellectual prowess, courage and beliefs. But for those of us who were blessed to keenly know the towering six foot, aquiline nosed, pipe- smoking, bespectacled, witty family man, it was altogether a different facet of the jewel that we experienced, as we celebrate his family values which were firmly underpinned with kindness and compassion. 
FDB was born on November 5, 1930 to Reginald and Freda Dias Bandaranaike whose close family the Bandaranaike Dynasty had a tradition in Law and Politics. For FDB it was a natural progression, like a duck taking to water, he glided into a career in Law and Politics effortlessly and immersed himself in the affairs of the State upon completing his home grown, trail blazing academic career at the University of Colombo and Law College. He was both brilliant and erudite and clearly his intellect, tenacity and courage under fire, were all too evident in his much debated hits and misses in a ruthlessly competitive political arena. FDB continued to dominate the political stage of Sri Lanka for many reasons and seasons. He provided an unparalleled and distinguished service to his motherland as a gallant leader. The accolades were many and criticism no less as Mark Antony lamented in Caesars funeral oration: The Evil that men do lives after them; the good is oft interred with their bones, and these sentiments reverberated in the actions of men who lost their reason when they crushed and humiliated FDB, an incredibly honest politician. 

Felix Dias Bandaranaike continued to dominate the political stage of Sri Lanka for many reasons and seasons. He provided an unparalleled and distinguished service to his motherland as a gallant leader

Lakshmi, my aunt and God Mother now an Octogenarian, is mentally agile and very graceful. She met her future husband to be when they were both in their late teens; she had many attributes; She was good-looking, clever and a confident student at Ladies College and, the brilliant, tall, dark and handsome FDB was a student at Royal College; they were both prize winners in their respective schools but the latter more so prolific at it! FDB came from a privileged background but school was a great equalizer. He relished school. He played truant, he smoked, perhaps unwittingly laying a foundation for his lifelong love of the pipe. He would hold his fellow students spell bound with his oratory skills. My aunt would relate how FDB with his sixth formers forced their way into Ladies College premises one particular year, as the big match fever descended upon them, sending Miss Opie in to a spin! And poor Miss Opie, like a mother hen scrambling to gather her delirious brood under her wings, had to shoo away the intruders. However, it took more than a shoo to dislodge FDB and the boys! Gone are the days, the likes of FDB and his cycle brigade who rode battered bicycles to impress the girls and cheer on their schools. Today, the preambleto the fever (not the match) is the flag waving noisy millennial brigades parading in luxury cars, blowing their trumpets almost in a frenzy and racing through the streets of Colombo.
FDBs and Lakshmis romance blossomed and flourished through university and Law College and they married in 1953.
They were both partners in a warm and loving marriage and she would always say I had no friends and Felix was my only friend. Naturally, FDB was her universe and he found her vulnerability irresistible like any other. In return, her warm affection was like a breath of fresh air, a far cry from the stiff upper lip Victorian upbringing he had. They fitted like a glove. My aunt would incessantly speak to us about his kindness. There was never a harsh word from him, she would remark and in the same breath would add Felix was a devil to crack jokes and laugh at his own jokes and trail off laughing, as if walking back in time, remembering the good times they shared together. 
Elenor Roosevelt said So I took an interest in politics, but I dont know whether I enjoyed it. It was a wifes duty to be interested in whatever interested her husband! Be it politics, books or a particular dish for dinner. Lakshmi did abide by it all and undertook much more, with exuberance and aplomb for her husband who wore many hats! 
FDB was a car enthusiast in the day and he drove a vintage Baby Austin which he prized. Somehow this pint sized car fittingly accommodated this oversized man. With Lakshmi beside him he was content even without the loaf of bread & the jug of wine, to roam the countryside on their holidays. They travelled the world together and many are their adventures. The walls of their Mahanuga Gardens home Granta is plastered with wonderful memories, some, at the zenith of their political career, with pictures telling their own story and both FDB and Lakshmi standing should.er to shoulder with celebrated Heads of States of yesteryear. 
In between these years and both becoming Barristers, Christine, their bundle of joy arrived: they named her after FDBs only sister. Lakshmi recalls how FDB carried the tiny new born in the giant palm of his hand! He was besotted with her from the moment he set eyes on her. He was a doting and devoted father and she gravitated to him. FDB found time to read bedtime stories to his little princess bringing these fables almost alive by dramatizing in his inimitable style much to her delight but, to the consternation of my aunt as sleep would escape the little girl. Christine would be truly wide awake absolutely enthralled and lost in her dads narratives.

FDB was in harmony with God and man; he had made his peace. Just before he could commence his post-graduate studies in Theology, he was struck down unfairly by a dreaded illness and entered glory on June 26, 1985
Lakshmi and Felix had a roller-coaster ride through life and through thick and thin and in good times and bad, they stuck like glue. They were each others strength. FDB had a higher calling though, than serving his country selflessly. It was a heaven sent divine proposition at the appointed time, particularly when he was unfairly and harshly dealt by the Machiavellian politicians. He became a victim of ruthless politics and consequently, when his faith in humans dimmed, his faith in the Almighty kicked in like a bolt of lightning! The words of wisdom from the wisest old Sage and King on the futility of mans labour as Vanity of vanities! All is vanity, struck a chord so profoundly in FDB. He now craved to labour only to lay his treasures in heaven. He hungered for the Word of God and to understand the deep mysteries it revealed. He enrolled at a Bible College in Portland, Oregon for a degree in Theology. The few years he spent in the USA with Lakshmi and Christine devoid from politics were truly happy and peaceful in nature. Above all, FDB was in harmony with God and man; he had made his peace. Just before he could commence his post-graduate studies in Theology, he was struck down unfairly by a dreaded illness and entered glory on June 26, 1985 to become a citizen of heaven. 
Well done, good and faithful servant. Enter into the joy of your Lord (Matthew 25:21) 
What an incredible invitation to die for!

Funding SL not withdrawn due to HR concerns: UK
	
The British Government had not withdrawn any funding to Sri Lanka due to human rights concerns between 2016-2019, State Minister for Asia and the Pacific Mark Field has said.
In response to a question by Shadow Foreign SecretaryEmily Thornberry on Monday, the State Minister said they were committed to supporting the rebuilding of Sri Lanka following its long civil conflict.
All funding provided to Sri Lanka through the Conflict, Stability, and Security Fund is designed to support reconciliation, the rule of law and improved human rights, and we are committed to supporting the rebuilding of the country following its long civil conflict, he said.
He said he announced an additional 1m funding through the Conflict, Stability and Security Fund (CSSF) to support the resettlement of families displaced by war in the north and east of Sri Lanka in August.
In total, the UK is providing Sri Lanka with 7.9 million of Conflict, Stability and Security Fund funding over three years (2016-2019), including support for police reform, reconciliation and peacebuilding, and de-mining in the north of the country, he said.

Gunman kills 12 in California bar
	
At least 11 people have been shot, including one police officer, at a bar in Thousand Oaks, California.
Reports say the shooting began at about 23:20 local time on Wednesday at the Borderline Bar and Grill about 40 miles (65km) north-west of Los Angeles.
Officials have confirmed the suspect is dead inside the venue, but warned the number of victims may still rise.
Reports say at least 200 people were inside the bar attending a college country music night at the time.
Footage broadcast on local media shows people being carried away from the scene, apparently with bullet wounds.
Witnesses have described a scene of panic in the bar. Dozens of shots were reportedly fired by the suspect.
People used chairs to break windows to escape, while others sheltered inside toilets.
Reports say the suspect may have used smoke grenades and at least one gun during the attack.(BBC)

## Title: Hypocrisy in the name of Democracy

Hypocrisy in the name of Democracy
	

This was a poster or rather sentiments that appeared to be popular at the demonstration in Kollupitiya last week following President Maithripala Sirisenas decision to sack Ranil Wickremesinghe and appoint Mahinda Rajapaksa as Prime Minister. 
Hafeel Farisz posted an interesting rejoinder on Facebook: Why havent the  democracy  activists called for an election yet If they werent there for Ranil but for democracy, then this really should be the call no HOLD THE DAMN ELECTION NOW - PARLIAMENT IS HORSE TRADING shouldve been the slogan innit Or am I reading democracy wrong 
One of the better definitions of democracy is that it refers to a government in which the supreme power is vested in the people and exercised by them directly or indirectly through a system of representation usually involving periodically held free elections. And yet, this definition does not speak to the political economy in which the democratic process unfolds. For example, we know that people have to vote only for those who actually contest, and candidacy is not a squeaky clean matter. Only a certain kind of person can contest or rather only a certain kind of person has a good chance of winning. There are exceptions, but this is the rule. 
Different countries have different systems where representation is obtained. The United States of America, for example, selects rather than elects its Presidents. There are other realities which rebel against the fundamental tenets of a sound democratic process best exemplified by the outright robbery that took place in the 2000 US Presidential Election. Malcolm X saw this early. Well, it was not a secret as far as African Americans and other non-white peoples in that country were concerned. Malcolm X didnt mince his words: This is American democracy and those of you who are familiar with it know that in America, democracy is hypocrisy. 
More caustic was the following observation which factored in the reality of an uneven, unequal and unjust polity: Democracy is an exercise in which the majority of people choose the sauce with which they are to be eaten.
Nevertheless, democracy is the word in the streets. To put it more accurately, democracy is the word in the Opposition Street. Democracy does not begin when parliament is dissolved and does not end when results are announced. However, since its representation through elections thats being talked of it is good to think about how democracy has been played (and ignored) over the years. 
When the first post-Independence elections were held, the Father of the Nation, so-called, stood at the ballot box with a club in hand to protect democracy. Intimidation, tampering with ballot-boxes and such became part of the story thereafter. And yet on that occasion and thereafter whenever democracy came under threat or was subverted, the beneficiaries and their loyalists were quiet for the most part. Many have to say sorry. Indeed it would be possible to come up with a list of the sorrowful IF remorse was part of their civic make-up. 

Democracy does not begin when parliament is dissolved and does not end when results are announced

Note: For reasons of space, we will not detail abuse thats common such as intimidation of voters, violence against opponents, misuse of state resources etc., and we shall leave out the squeaky clean gurus of Democracy and Decency in the International Community who are no different from the kinds of people mentioned below. We will not talk of those for whom extrajudicial killing of thousands upon thousands in the eighties was ok. We will not talk of those for whom similar excesses in the North and East during the war against terrorism was ok. We wont talk of those who uttered not a word when the LTTE blew up buses, trains and carried out suicide attacks on civilians]. 
So, here goes: the COLLECTIVE APOLOGY TO DEMOCRACY. 
Those of us who knew of D.S. Senanayakes strange notions of democracy and were silent 
Those of us who were silent when Mrs Sirimavo Bandaranaike abused parliamentary numbers and constitutional provisions in 1975 to extend the life of Parliament by two years, are sorry. Democracy, please forgive us. 
Those of us who were silent, on account of political loyalty, when J.R. Jayewardene and the United National Party promulgated the Second Republican Constitution in 1978 which is widely recognized as being responsible for much of the democratic deficits on account of which theres been much suffering, are sorry.
Democracy, please forgive us. Forgive us also for silence over the skulduggery and horrendous violation of basic democratic principles in the Referendum and Presidential Election of 1982. 
Those of us who were silent, on account of political loyalty, when the Constitution was amended no less than 16 times during the J.R. Jayewardena years, mostly for partisan reasons, including the 13th Amendment that gave credence to Eelamist myth-modeling among other tragedies 
Those of us who were silent, on account of political loyalty, when the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) warned that the first person who dared vote at each polling station in the various elections held in 1988 and 1989 would be shot dead and did in fact shoot hundreds 
Those of us who were silent, on account of political loyalty, when the Chandrika Kumaratunga regime orchestrated a move to get Chief Justice Sarath N Silva to facilitate crossovers in Parliament 
Those of us who were silent when a group of Parliamentarians crossed over to the UNP in 2001, thereby tilting numbers against the elected government 
Those of us who were silent, on account of political loyalty, regarding the flaws of the well-intentioned 17th Amendment in 2001 
Those of us who were silent, on account of political loyalty, when the United National Front (UNF) Government of Ranil Wickremesinghe, with the support of President Kumaratunga, bypassed Parliament and the people to sign an agreement with the LTTE in February 2001 
Those of us who were silent, on account of political loyalty, President Kumaratunga took over three key ministries and thereby scuttled the UNF Government in 2003 
Those of us who were silent, on account of political loyalty, when Mahinda Rajapaksa introduced and got Parliament to pass the patently anti-democracy 18th Amendment in September 2010 
Those of us who were silent, on account of political loyalty, in all party elections under constitutions that favored the particular leader, especially that of the United National Party 
Those of us who were silent Those of us who were silent, on account of political loyalty, when President Sirisena appointed Ranil Wickremesinghe as Prime Minister in January 2015 when, at that time, he commanded a parliamentary strength of only a little over 40 
Those of us who were silent, on account of political loyalty, when parliamentarians of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) expressed support to the Yahapalana Government, again in January 2015 
Those of us who were silent, on account of political loyalty, when the Yahapalana Government Sirisena and Wickremesinghe in April 2015 promulgated the horrendously flawed 19th Amendment and especially the deliberately vaguely-worded term National Government which is at the heart of the current political and constitutional imbroglio 
Those of us who were silent, on account of political loyalty, when the Yahapalana Government dissolved Parliament in June 2015 to stop the damning COPE report on the Central Bank bond scam was to be presented to Parliament 
Those of us who were silent, on account of political loyalty, when President Sirisena arbitrarily sacked the Secretaries of the SLFP and the United Peoples Freedom Alliance (UPFA), appointed loyalists in their place and effectively crucified the relevant Central Committees through a court order days before the General Election in 2015 
Those of us who were silent, on account of political loyalty, when President Sirisena arbitrarily sacked Ranil Wickremesinghe and appointed Mahinda Rajapaksa as Prime Minister on October 26, 2018 
Those of us who were silent when Ranil Wickremesinghe (on behalf of the UNP) and Maithripala Sirisena (on behalf of the SLFP) postponed local government elections and provincial council elections 
All of us, without exception, individually and collectively, are sorry. Sorry, democracy, we have abused your name, we have ranted and raved about you being violated only when we found ourselves at the receiving end of villainy and were silent and indeed not averse to cheering when such violence benefited the camps we belonged to or supported. 
Perhaps every single citizen who has voiced objections in the name of democracy and good governance selectively, can converge on Galle Face Green one of these days, each carrying a placard with the following legend: I ONLY SAY IM HERE FOR DEMOCRACY AND GOOD GOVERNANCE, BUT I AM REALLY HERE FOR . 
Bottom line, if you are serious about democracy, you just cannot be a hypocrite. It just sounds stupid.

Leaders may talk about nationalism, but they depend on money to retain power  -Rajitha Dissanayake
	
Rajitha Dissanayakes newest play Hithala Gaththu Theeranayak, (A well-made decision), premiers at the Lionel Wendt Theatre tomorrow (Friday) and on Saturday 10th November, at 7.00 pm. This is Dissanayakes 11th full-length play, and it promises to be a high-quality drama that addresses current socio-political issues. Dissanayakes plays have won critical review, popular support and notable awards. Some of his well-loved plays are Weeraya Merila, Sihina Horu Arang, Apahu Harenna Ba, Aadara Wasthuwa and Nethuwa Bari Minhek. Dissanayake spoke to Daily Mirror on several wide-ranging issues, including art, politics, and the current socio-political environment in Sri Lanka.
The economic pressures felt by society are beingfelt very seriouslyby artists as well
	As a citizen I feel the way the recent change of government happened is completely unacceptable
	Political leaders are supposed torepresent the interests of the people
	The challenge for us is to maintain standards in the spaces where we still wield some influence and control
Q Its been two years since you produced your last play. What can audiences expect from your new play Hithala Gaththu Theeranayak 
The play explores how people make so called well-made decisions in life, and in love, and how they react when such decisions go wrong. Such situations can spiral out of control, and go from bad to worse. In contrast, there can be hastily made decisions that turn out good. I attempt to hold a mirror to society, to ourselves, to examine different elements of human nature and their impact on human relationships.
The story takes place in contemporary society, and the characters we see are familiar to us. So the play is very much bound to the current socio-political context of the country, especially with regards to how power complicates all human relationships. We cannot escape the current corrupt socio-political situation engulfing us. So Hithala Gaththu Theeranayak is a sort of extension of my previous plays.
Q Your plays usually draw a line between the personal and the political. Does your new play also attempt this
I try to tell stories through my characters and the various situations they confront. I use dialogue and the characters behavioural traits to achieve this. But the play does not limit itself to the characters actions. It also examines the wider society they inhabit.
We have yet to see a government that takes principled decisions for the betterment of society
Q What kind of understanding or insight will the audience gain from watching this play at this particular political juncture
The play has no direct connection to the current political games being played out. But its not completely disconnected from them either. The play focuses on the human condition, and ultimately the actions of individual characters are meant to transcend the stage and impact the audience.
So I hope this will compel audiences to reflect on themselves, as well as on the current political moment we are all experiencing.
Q How important is it for your audience to reflect on this current political moment 
The current political moment were experiencing demands deep introspection from us all. We need to examine how we behave in different relationships. How do relationships change when agreements are broken, or when someone betrays us How do people react when theres a breakdown of trust How do we react when we lose love, or when we want to be loved What kind of a pain does all this elicit And how do we cope with that pain Actually, the play addresses these conflicts in a more civilised manner than what we are seeing in society today. If such conflicts are not handled in a civilised manner, a society can face a major crisis. In our politics the act of gaining power and losing power is not handled in a civilised manner. In society we see actors who cannot control their pain. But in the play we see characters who cope much better with their pain. So the action outside the play is, in many ways, more dramatic than the play itself.
Q Can you elaborate on that
The happenings in the outside world are more absurd than the situations depicted in the play. If I had incorporated into the script some of the scenarios happening outside, audiences may well have found them unbelievable. Thats because these happenings are quite unbelievable. In more developed societies governance happens within an accepted framework of laws and norms. These determine crucial matters such as the transfer of power, the changing of governments, appointments made to state institutions, policies regarding public health and education, and other important issues that affect the people. Theres a system in place, and an accepted method is followed. The situation here is more serious. In fact, its unacceptable. Its also unbelievable. We, as a society, are witnessing the unbelievable. Its both incomprehensible and absurd.
Q What do you find significant about the current happenings in the political arena
What I find significant about this current political moment is the complete breakdown of trust between people. We see leaders signing affidavits and pledging allegiance to one side on one day, and then crossing over to the other side the next day. In doing so they are violating their contract with their voters who backed them to uphold certain policies and programmes. As a citizen I feel the way the recent change of government happened is completely unacceptable. It was done flouting all democratic norms and standards. Theres a way power should change hands. Thats either through an election,or through the defeat of the budget in parliament. Its only after the composition of parliament changes that other changes can be made. But right now, attempts are being made to change the composition of parliament by forcibly taking over the state media, state institutions, the police and other state bodies. This is neither civilised, nor virtuous. But while we condemn such actions, there are certain intellectuals and lawyers who condone them, and call them constitutional. Then theres another group of academics and lawyers who call it illegal. Who are the people to believe
Q What do you believe
I believe that what happened was immoral and unethical. It happened in a secretive and blatantly conspiratorial manner. But regrettably, these acts are accepted by some people, and even have the blessings of religious leaders. Are these religious leaders following their religious teachings Are they speaking on behalf of their devotees Or are they furthering the political and power interests of politicians Religious leaders have failed to alert the people to the dangers of such political manoeuvrings. Meanwhile, intellectuals and lawyers are justifying both sides. Political leaders are supposed to represent the interests of the people. But they only care about their own power, their own interests and their own safety.
People have run out of options to ease their pain. So they find various outlets and methods to express their despair. They are living under tremendous economic pressure. Consumerism is making more and more demands on our lives
Q But theres a section of the population that endorses such acts.
Yes. And this is very problematic. As a society we have faced some very painful and bitter experiences. Despite this, most people dont seem to have any strong opinions on freedom. Instead whats foremost for them is fulfilling their economic needs to cope with the demands of todays consumerist society. People appear to be watching whats going on as if it had no impact on them. Maybe if they accepted that all this impacted them directly, they would not be able to cope with the pain that realisation brings. People have run out of options to ease their pain. So they find various outlets and methods to express their despair. They are living under tremendous economic pressure. Consumerism is making more and more demands on our lives. With no solution in sight, people are being fed with large doses of false morals, nationalism and religion. These three intoxicants are used to tame and control people. We are used to teaching lessons, but we dont seem to learn lessons from our own past experiences. We keep repeating the same mistakes.
Q What is the role of the artist in such a situation
Artists must try and understand the human condition. We must ask why people respond to certain situations in the way they do. Why are people letting go of norms and values in this country How has the world overcome such unbecoming impulses Sri Lanka has a significant population that respects the rule of law, that doesnt endorse violence and that aspires to a better society. All is not lost. But theres a tendency for people to endorse everything committed by their own party, and condemn everything from the rival camp. This is a narrow, limited and selfish approach. Leaders switch parties, and say the exact opposite, without an iota of shame. Artists must hold a mirror to society to reflect on and expose such behaviour. We must ask whether this situation can be mended, and if so how Thats the role of art and artists in this current situation.
Q In addition to being a dramatist, you also work in the media and in the university system. How has the media and the education sector in Sri Lanka contributed to the breakdown of norms and standards you mention
The media today is dominated by a largely untrained workforce. Media personnel today dont undergo any rigorous professional training as in the past. Media companies dont encourage this because they fear a well-trained journalist would be picked up by a rival network. In our universities, especially in the Humanities, were seeing fewer and fewer undergraduates who truly love the subjects they are learning. Their focus is more on earning a certificate. So the challenge for us is to maintain standards in the spaces where we still wield some influence and control. We must try and prevent the falling standards in other areas from seeping into our spaces of work and study. After all, there are four important pillars that hold up a society. They are teachers, journalists, artists and religious leaders. If these four pillars are strong,then politicians can be held accountable, and the kind of political decline we are seeing today can be lessened significantly.
Q How has this political decline evolved over your lifetime, since you were a youth in the 1980s, moving on to the 1990s and 2000s, and now the present
I remember our parents talking about falling norms and standards, and increasing violence and suppression in the 1980s. The change promised in 1994 never really materialised, and the situation degenerated to previous conditions. The continuing war also changed peoples values, especially regarding the value of human life. Even today many people die in tragic and violent circumstances. But this has become normalized. We have yet to see a government that takes principled decisions for the betterment of society. All we have seen are leaders who tighten their grip on power by exploiting resources and flouting the law. So the real problems of the people are not being addressed, and the truth is being shielded from them.
Q Are politicians the only ones to blame
Theres another category of people, mainly high-ranking public officials, who exploit the political situation to plunder the countrys resources. They operate through various means, even rising through the ranks of trade unions, to gain prestige and status. The state sector has declined because the main criteria for appointments and power within them is political affiliation, not skill or competence. We saw this clearly in the last few days. One group of employees hijacks power, and another group is cast aside. When such selfish and politically motivated people occupy the state sector, more independent and non-partisan workers are silenced, or they maintain a distance from workplace politics.
Sri Lanka has a significant population that respects the rule of law
Q Money changing hands in politics is a major topic these days. Theres talk of bribery, corruption and commissions. What do you make of this nexus between politics and money
Supporting the two major parties has become a business investment. Most political sponsors have a vested business interest. Very few engage in politics out of a sense of duty or vocation, or based on sound principles. Now politicians themselves engage in business. They use politics for maximum commercial profit. We see this phenomenon from local to national level politics. Leaders may talk about nationalism, but they depend on money to retain power. Money is even used to influence public opinion. Everyone in the party machinery - from ordinary supporters, to sponsors, to members and leaders - they all have a price. So if a larger sum if offered by the opposing camp, they outright switch sides. Portfolios dont just benefit ministers. They benefit their families, friends and other associates, bestowing them with tremendous privileges. This entire process naturally erodes trust, which I spoke of earlier.
Q This is your eleventh play. Producing a play is a process. As an artist, what changes have you seen in this process over the last couple of decades
I have been able to sustain my plays over a long period due to the continuing support of a group of artists, both old and new,who love the stage and are committed to this art form. Over the years we have built a good understanding and work ethic. Their support and dedication has been vital to the running of my plays. We also have a dedicated audience that has supported our work over the years. But with time, these situations encounter challenges as well. Although the dedication and commitment of my fellow artists has not diminished, they have grown more fatigued with time. Many go for dubbing after rehearsals, or for shoots before rehearsals. Their capacity to be selective artistically has diminished. Earlier they could refuse offers, and focus on one project. But that is not the case now. The economic pressures felt by society are being felt very seriously by artists as well. But even under such trying circumstances the artists in my play have committed themselves to perfect their craft and put together the best possible production. Even the audience faces economic challenges, but they still gather to watch plays. The winds of decline may have swept away some roofs, from some houses. But there are still some houses with their roofs intact. There is hope, and we must hold on to that hope and reclaim what has been taken from us.

The United National Party (UNP) yesterday said it will take legal action if Parliament is dissolved as anticipated.
This was revealed by UNP Chairman Kabir Hashim at a media briefing last evening.
We will make use of whatever legal provisions available and take action if the House is dissolved, UNP Chairman said. As per the 19th Amendment to the constitution, the President is free to dissolve Parliament only after the present one completes four and a half years of its term. The only way out is to allow a political group to show a majority in the House, he added.
Mr Hashim alleged that investors had taken out as much as Rs.7 billion from the Colombo stock market during the past seven days. Additionally, he said JICA has suspended several projects that had been in the pipeline including the new Kelani Bridge project after the present crisis erupted.
UNP MP Eran Wickramaratne, sharing his views, said that MPs both from the SLMC and the ACMC have gone abroad for their safety. In the past, only media personnel fled the country fearing for their safety, however today even MPs are leaving the country for this very reason, he said. (Yohan Perera)

Mankind International Limited continues to redefine employment placement in Sri Lanka
	
Mankind International Limited, one of Sri Lankas leaders and pioneers in employment placement celebrates 40 years in operation this year. Better known as Maritime Placements Ltd or Maritime International Ltd, a brand name which created many a career in the past four decades, the company was rebranded as Mankind International Limited in 2015.
Launched in 1978 in a small office with only 2 employees, the vision at inception was to introduce a revolutionary concept to Sri Lanka. Employment placement as a corporate business not being familiar territory 40 years ago, the organization should be given much credit for the initiation and development of an industry, which today is also one of the most flourishing. With the new brand name symbolizing the core of its operations, the group is set to further enhance the recruitment industry by continuing to innovate and add value.
Chairman of Mankind International Limited Mr. Fayaz Saleem reminisces about the early days when Maritime International Ltd was first launched, and stepping into foreign placements with one of the oldest active license numbers from the Foreign Employment Bureau, No. 11. With Maritime International starting to focus more on foreign employment placements, we did our first diversification by launching Maritime Placements (Pvt.) Ltd. to handle all local placements. Today MPL has become one of the biggest internal companies as it has further expanded into sub-companies handling Contractual Solutions, Outsourcing, Transport and Engineering, Property Management and Maintenance, and Allied Cleaning and Maintenance. Further development resulted in establishing Executive Search Limited, to specialize in overseas placements for banks, hotels and restaurant chains, conglomerates and multi-national organizations, mainly in Arab countries.
Mankind is also the catalyst in introducing headhunting to Sri Lanka, through its subsidiary, Appointment of International Management Specialists (AIMS). Being the very first recruitment company to initiate headhunting, Mr. Saleem and his team can narrate many anecdotes of the encounters they had with potential candidates. The concept of headhunting was not known 25 years ago. We were met with resistance and suspicion when we spoke to candidates. However, we persisted through it all by following international norms and practices, and maintaining confidentiality. Through a series of activities, the organization created knowledge and understanding of the policies, principles and processes of headhunting, and educated potential candidates about the advantages of being headhunted as well as ways of responding to such offers. The team ensures highly ethical practices and respects the candidates need for confidentiality and sometimes that of the client as well, to the extent that the meetings are scheduled at the convenience of the candidates preferred times and locations. To date Mankind International Limited has placed individuals at many management and higher management positions in leading organizations in the country.
With employment placement as its core business, Mankind commenced a Corporate Sustainability activity under HR Solutions, a training programme for young executives and managers. The fairly economical fee for the programme is beneficial for two groups; companies that do not have large budgets for training and individuals who are interested in adding value to their professional portfolio. The trainings are conducted after office hours, thus ensuring that it does not impose on their jobs.
The revolutionary spirit continues with candidate witnessed by the latest venture by the name of Mankind IT, specializing in IT placements. Recognizing the boost in the IT industry and the growth of many international and local companies, Mankind IT will specifically speak to the IT professional, identifying, recruiting and creating careers within the country for an industry which suffers much brain drain due to the lack of proper placement.
Answering the question as to what the secret behind the years of success is, Mr. Saleem emphasizes that it is mainly the relationship they build with both their stakeholders; the client and the candidate. He also acknowledged the contributions of his Directors and senior staff who have been with Mankind between 10 and 22 years. The requirements of organizations as well as employees continue to change. We always insist on meeting clients in their own environment so that we too understand the culture, structure and future of the organization. As for the candidate, we look beyond educational, professional qualifications and experience; Attitude plays a main role in an employee integrating into an organization. With this focus we have been creating careers, and successful ones, for 40 years, evident by the fact that our previous candidates have often come back as clients, added Mr. Saleem.
Mankind International Limited will continue to specialize further according to the needs of the clientele and the changes in the industry, similar to introducing headhunting 25 years ago and launching Mankind IT a year ago. The organization will always seek newer and better ways to create the best possible careers for Sri Lankans at all levels.

Patriotic solidarity to save democracy
	
Rauff Hakeem, Rishad Bathiudeen and Sampanthan appearing on the same podium with majority Sinhalese parliamentarians, declare that all that happened since President Sirisenas premeditated coup is undemocratic and that the parliament should be called into session immediately. In the annals of modern political history what the President did in Sri Lanka goes against all principles of democracy and a total disregard for the constitution of the country. An independent supreme judicial body is sure to condemn his action and declare it illegal. The civilized world is no doubt outraged. 
It was the Tamil and Muslim minority votes that played the crucial role in ending Mahinda Rajapaksas undemocratic and tyrannical regime to save Sri Lankas democracy in 2015.Sirisena, the man who was prepared to back-stab Rajapaksa in the name of democracy in 2015 has now back-stabbed democracy itself to bring back the one he betrayed, but through the back door.
This president who claims to be a staunch Buddhist has now lost his moral right to remain in that esteemed office.
Likewise, this is also not to argue against the right of Mahinda Rajapaksa to contest for prime ministership or presidency. What is being argued is that he should seek his position and enter the parliament through the front door. If the majority supports him who can deny his victory
What Hakeem, Bathiudeen, Sampanthan and the Sinhalese majority have done in this context will be remembered by future generations as an event that saved democracy and freedom in Sri Lanka. 
This is not to argue in support of Ranil Wickremesinghe and his incompetent government. His inaction and procrastination to deliver on promises he made to the voters mark him as the most unproductive prime minister the country ever produced since independence.
He allowed corruption to rule, the guilty to escape, rule of law to debilitate, and budget deficits to balloon and drive down the value of local currency, while cost of living shot through the roof to drown his voters in poverty and debt. No wonder the people punished his administration severely at the recent local council elections. However, a prime minister elected by the majority should also be thrown out by the majority and not by a capricious president who treats his office like a village headman trampling over the lives of his fellow villagers. 
Sri Lanka has a proud history of engineering peaceful political changes and respect for democracy and justice. That comes from its pluralist culture. Let that glorious past not be ruined by a gamarala president  
Likewise, this is also not to argue against the right of Mahinda Rajapaksa to contest for prime ministership or presidency. What is being argued is that he should seek his position and enter the parliament through the front door. If the majority supports him who can deny his victory 
In many of my writings on Muslim politics in Sri Lanka I have been constantly critical of Muslim politicians for their opportunistic behaviour, status consciousness and lack of patriotism. On this occasion however, the action of Hakeem and Bathiudeen throwing their weight behind Sampanthan and his TNA to Show solidarity with the Sinhalese majority is a commendable act. To save democracy and freedom of the people is an act of patriotism and they should stand steadfast in their decision. 
No sooner the backdoor cabinet assumed power, it has unleashed a series of populist measures in the name of reducing the cost of living.
Did any of them think of the impact those measures are going to have on the national budget There is no word about how budget revenue is going to be raised to cover the escalating deficit. Is more borrowing and higher level of national debt the solution 
It was the Tamil and Muslim minority votes that played the crucial role in ending Mahinda Rajapaksas undemocratic and tyrannical regime to save Sri Lankas democracy in 2015. Sirisena, the man who was prepared to back-stab Rajapaksa in the name of democracy in 2015 has now back-stabbed democracy itself to bring back the one he betrayed, but through the back door
The president also seems to think that by dismissing an elected prime minister and installing in his place his former adversary, that he has protected his presidency for a second term.
He is going to have a nightmare. True, there is no permanent friend and foe in politics. But the presidents renewed friendship with Rajapaksa does not guarantee a second term for Sirisena, because there is another from the Rajapaksa clan waiting in the wing with presidential aspirations. 
Finally, Indias hand in this coup is becoming clear by the day. How else can one explain Subramanyaswamy advising Sampanthan to join hands with Rajapaksa in the interest of the Tamil community How will China react to this drama is another story for another time. 
Sri Lanka has a proud history of engineering peaceful political changes and respect for democracy and justice. That comes from its pluralist culture. Let that glorious past not be ruined by a gamarala president.

PC polls likely to be held in early 2019 - Dilan
	
Three UPFA stalwarts today vowed that there will be no dissolution of Parliament, early Presidential or General election or a referendum to come over the current political and constitutional crisis and added however that the new government would do its utmost to hold the Provincial Council polls as early as possible.
Highways and Road Development Minister S.B. Dissanayaka, Parliamentarians Dilan Perera and Thilanga Sumathipala told the media at the Center for Media Freedom that the Mahinda Rajapaksa government was determined to hold PC polls soon after attending to the issues related to delimitation and electoral system.
I expect we would be in a position to hold PC polls in early 2019 after resolving the contentious issues related to delimitation and the electoral system, Mr. Perera said.
Commenting on the UNPs demand to convene Parliament immediately to check who has the confidence of the majority of members in Parliament Mr. Perera said the Speaker Karu Jayasuriya has no right to override President Sirisenas orders and Parliament would convene on the day decided by the President.
Why does the UNP not seek the opinion of the Supreme Court if the President has violated the Constitution. Speaker Jayasuriya must end this 'nadagama' in Parliament and permit Parliamentary business without violating the Standing Orders. He has no right whatsoever to bypass the gazette notification issued by President Sirisena. Therefore, Parliamentary business on the 14th would be restricted only to the policy statement of President Sirisena. The party leaders will decide when to take up the no-confidence motion if there is any in the Order Paper he said.
Mr. Perera said the statement of Speaker Jayasuriya that he would adhere to the position that remained in Parliament before October 26, Mr. Perera asked whether Mr. Jaysuriya was confident that Mr. Wickremesinghe had the absolute majority in Parliament to maintain that position.
Where are the 126 members who allegedly demanded him to reconvene Parliament. He never published their names. My opinion is that there were only 107 members at the meeting held in Parliament that day, he said.
Asked whether the government would apply all tricks to delay the no-confidence motion, Mr. Sumathipala said no and added it will take mostly five days.
First, Parliament after the opening ceremony and policy statement of the President must elect a House Leader, Chief Whip and members to the Parliamentary Committees that also include the Business Committee or the committee of party leaders. Party leaders must decide on the day of the debate and vote on the no-confidence motion. I hope we could take up the no-confidence motion in five days after the opening ceremony, Mr. Sumathipala said. (Sandun A. Jayasekera)

Fonseka told a media briefing that dissolution of the House would be unconstitutional as President could do it only after the term of Parliament reaches four and a half year of its current term.
He also alleged that plans are also being made to come up with a false story on a plot to assassinate President. Plans are being made to bribe an underworld figure to make him say that I have given him the contract to assassinate the President, he said. (Yohan Perera)

Prez can dissolve P'ment under 33 (2) C of 19 A: Fmr. CJ
	
Former Chief Justice Sarath N Silva said yesterday the President had been vested with powers to dissolve Parliament under 33 (2) C of the 19th Amendment to the Constitution.
He told Daily Mirror that this special provision was incorporated into the Constitution under duties, powers and functions of the President in accordance with the judgment of the Supreme Court.
He said this special provision says that in addition to the powers, duties and functions expressly conferred or imposed on, or assigned to the President by the Constitution or other written law, the President shall have the power to summon, prorogue and dissolve Parliament.
He said the 19th Amendment brought in by the Ranil Wickremesinghe government in 2002, sought to remove the powers of President to dissolve parliament and make provisions that the President can dissolve Parliament only on the basis of a resolution passed with a simple majority in parliament, but this was challenged in the Supreme Court by several petitioners and the SC gave a ruling that it should be approved by a two thirds majority in Parliament and approved by the people in a referendum.
He said the present government amended Article 70 of the Constitution in the manner that the President may by Proclamation, summon, prorogue and dissolve Parliament: Provided that the President shall not dissolve Parliament until the expiration of a period of not less than four years and six months from the date appointed for its first meeting, unless Parliament requests the President to do so by a resolution passed by not less than two-thirds of the whole number of members.
He said when amending Article 70, section 33 (2) C was introduced in the 19th Amendment in 2015 in accordance with the judgment of the SC and added that the prevailing provision of the Constitution was 33 (2) C.
The President can act on his own in a critical situation or on a resolution approved by the Parliament when dissolving Parliament. This new section was incorporated to evade a referendum, he said. (Ajith Siriwardane)

Prez mulls over referendum to dissolve Parliament Sees it as a viable option to break current impass

The political equation is constantly changing these days making it difficult for anyone to conclude which side would emerge with the required parliamentary majority to form a stable administration by the time Parliament meets on November 14. The United Peoples Freedom Alliance (UPFA) led by President Maithripala Sirisena was scoring high in the political scorecard with the support of 105 members in comparison to the United National Partys (UNP) 98 seats early this week. However, the UPFA suffered a setback when MP Manusha Nanayakkara, who was sworn in as a Deputy Minister, relinquished his office and stood with the UNP leadership.
It delt a psychological blow to the game of toing and froing. Perplexed, the other members, who had initial plans to switch allegiance to the new Government, now have secondthoughts regarding their moves. It has led to the delay in the swearing in of Cabinet Ministers. The remaining 13 Cabinet slots are kept open for anyone defecting from the UNP. 

The current crisis has already created a split in the TNA

Inducements galore
It is no longer a political exercise driven by policies or ideals. Instead, it is a game of luring members by both sides who are offering lucrative inducements in terms of cash or ministerial perks, if not both. Political integrity, ideals and policies hold little or no value in this game. It has immensely dented the image of MPs before the general public. 
By Tuesday, there was disillusionment within certain quarters of the UPFA as some of the UNPers who gave firm assurances earlier were backtracking from their stands. It has happened because the monetary deals they expected were not in their favour.
They were reportedly demanding better packages of cash inducements in addition to ministerial posts.
As reported, on the one hand, these MPs who plan to cross over bargain with the other side to get better deals. At the same time, they also try to make demands from their own party hierarchy threatening to quit unless they agree to them.
In a sense, it is now an opportunity for some cash- strapped politicians to straighten out their financial difficulties.
Crossovers can keep the balance of political power in favour of either side by the day.

As reported, on the one hand, these MPs who plan to cross over bargain with the other side to get better deals. At the same time, they also try to make demands from their own party

By last Sunday, the ground situation looked favourable to the UPFA. There was a glimmer of hope for them as UNP MP for the Puttalam district Asoka Priyantha switched allegiance to them. Nevertheless, it flickered out on Tuesday as Manusha Nanayakkara returned to the UNP. Things became even arduous for the UPFA since the Tamil National Alliance (TNA) and the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) decided to throw their weight behind the UNP. They put their stand in a couched language.
Come what may, the country is poised to be politically volatile, unstable and ungovernable. Even if the new Government secures a majority in Parliament, it wont be a close- knit political front. To govern the country with a loose coalition will be uncomfortable and impractical in the long run. In case, the UNP manages to pass no confidence motion against the Prime Minister, the Cabinet will stand dissolved, but not Parliament. Then, the President will have to appoint another person as the Prime Minister. One cannot expect the President to reconsider Wickremesinghe to the post given the rancour between the two reaching an all-time high. Hypothetically, the appointment of another from the UNP as the PM will create rumblings. 
As such, the dissolution of Parliament is the only option and declaring a snap general election looks the most viable option. However, the 19th Amendment to the Constitution has barred President Maithripala Sirisena from dissolving Parliament for four and half years from its first sitting day. If it is to be dissolved before that, a resolution should be passed by two-thirds in Parliament and communicated to the President. It is only possible if the UPFA and the UNP agree. As things stand at the moment, it is unrealistic to anticipate the two parties to strike such a deal.
Therefore, it is reported that President Sirisena is currently mulling a referendum to seek public approval for the dissolution. It is at the sole discretion of the President to declare a referendum on any matter of public interest inhis opinion.
Article 86 of the Constitution says, The President may, subject to the provisions of Article 85, submit to the People by Referendum any matter which in the opinion of the President is of national importance.
Accordingly, there is a discourse among the legal luminaires associated with the new Government in this regard. The President can seek approval of the people by a referendum to dissolve Parliament. If the people voted in favour of the proposal, the President can proceed with his action overriding current barriers.

Come what may, the country is poised to be politically volatile, unstable and ungovernable. Even if the new Government secures a majority in Parliament, it wont be a close- knit political front

SLMC, ACMC in moral dilemma  
The current political impasse has become a matter of concern for two parties representing the Muslims  Sri Lanka Muslim Congress (SLMC) and All Ceylon Makkal Congress (ACMC). SLMC Leader Rauff Hakeem and ACMC Leader Rishad Bathiudeen have decided to remain with the UNP.
Let alone, they are perturbed over purported moves by the UPFA to woo their members individually regardless of their party position. According to inside political sources, these two leaders are in a quandary as to what they should do to keep their parties intact amids such attempts.During the past few days, the SLMC engaged with its rank and file, and the Muslim clerics. The Muslim community, by and large, is still with the UNP. Against the backdrop, any crossover from the SLMC or the ACMC will be viewed as an action done purely for monetary gains.
SLMCers describe their current moral dilemma in this regard in reference to the Tamil proverb which says, if anyone drinks milk under a Palmyra tree, onlookers will assume him to be drinking toddy.

Tamil politicians emulate Muslim counterparts
The current crisis has already created a split in the TNA. Already, its MP for the Batticaloa district S. Viyalendran has taken oath as a Deputy Minister. The TNA rides on the Tamil nationalist sentiments of people in the north and the east and gets votes in en bloc in most cases. Political rights dominate their campaign themes. In fact, development is hardly talked of in their manifestos. This has been the established practice in Tamil politics in the north and the east. The established Muslim parties act otherwise in these two provinces. They have the practice of teaming up with the party in power and getting the development needs of their constituents addressed. So, in the eastern province in particular, vast disparities exist between the Tamil and Muslim majority areas as far as development is concerned. This phenomenon has now driven Tamil politicians to emulate their Muslim counterparts because otherwise their constituencies will continue to lag behind leaving people in backwaters.
Mr. Viyalendrans crossover to the Government can be viewed in that context. That is to be party to the Government and develop their areas.

Science and innovations: Where does Sri Lanka stand
	
Saturday November 10 is the United Nations World Science Day for Peace and Development and the UN in a statement says the organization of a focused event related to the commitment to science and society was one of the positive outcomes of the 1999 Budapest World Conference on Science. It was considered an opportunity to reaffirm each year the commitment to attaining the goals proclaimed in the Declaration on Science and the Use of Scientific Knowledge and to follow up the recommendations of the Science Agenda: Framework for Action.
According to the UN, since its proclamation by UNESCO in 2001, World Science Day for Peace and Development has generated many concrete projects, programmes and funding for science around the world. The Day has also helped foster cooperation among scientists living in regions marred by conflict, one example being the UNESCO-supported creation of the Israeli-Palestinian Science Organization (IPSO).
The UN says the rationale of celebrating a World Science Day for Peace and Development has its roots in the importance of the role of science and scientists for sustainable societies and in the need to inform and involve citizens in science. In this sense, the occasion will offer an opportunity to show the people the relevance of science in their lives and to engage them in discussions. Such a venture will also bring a wider perspective to the global search for peace and development.
The first World Science Day for Peace and Development was celebrated worldwide on November 10, 2002 under UNESCO auspices. The celebration involved many partners, such as governmental, intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations, UNESCO National Commissions, scientific and research institutions, professional associations, the media, science teachers and schools.
According to the Technology Times website, this years World Science Day theme is, Science a Human Right to acknowledge the contribution of science and scientists toward development of society. The theme highlights the relation between science and society. It aims to create communal awareness of how science contributes to sustainable societies, international solidarity, international collaboration in science for the benefit of society and raising support to encounter challenges that science faces today, the website says. It is a good starting point for the scientists to better understand human rights and it brings focus to be familiar with the right of everyone to enjoy the benefits of scientific progress including the rights to health, food, a clean environment, and as the universal assertion of Human Rights.
Noting that children as young as two or three are naturally curious and see possibilities in even the simplest devices, we can create engaging science activities using everyday materials like cups, pieces of paper, straws and even vegetables and fruits. While not all children have to become scientists, we have to make sure that all children get on an equal footing early on. Basic science literacy with which we make sense of the world around us should not be a privilege  it should be a human right.
In a statement, UNESCO says that by linking science more closely with society, World Science Day for Peace and Development aims to ensure that citizens are kept informed of developments in science. It also underscores the role scientists play in broadening our understanding of the remarkable, fragile planet we call home and in making our societies more sustainable.
UNESCO Director General Audrey Azoulay says this right is enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which celebrates its 70th anniversary this year, but it is only when we use this right to join and support scientific endeavours that we can transition to stronger science and reinforce scientific culture in our societies. UNESCO also calls on governments, businesses, civil society and scientists to fully embrace the values of responsible and ethical science, by implementing the 2017 UNESCO Recommendation on Science and Scientific Researchers. Together, we should strive for greater access to science education - particularly for girls and support Open Science and innovative ways for advancing research, he said.
In Sri Lanka, it is sad that we rarely find young people who are passionate about Science, its creative, innovative, imaginative and enterprising dimensions. The government, whoever is in office now, needs to do much more to promote among schoolchildren a desire to be innovative and creative so that they could promote peace and sustainable development.

SLTB fares down by 2% from tonight
	
After the decision taken by the National Transport Commission yesterday the ticket fares of the Sri Lanka Transport Board (SLTB) will be reduced by two per cent from midnight today.
Sri Lanka Transport Board (SLTB) Chairman Ramal Siriwardane said the NTCs decision to reduce the bus fare rates would also apply to the SLTB fares.
There would be no change with the minimum fare which is Rs.12, he said.
Yesterday, the NTC had taken the decision to reduce the bus fare by two per cent after a discussion held with several private bus associations.
The NTC had taken the decision to respect Finance Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa over his decision to cut down the price of auto diesel by Rs.7 with effect from November 1, Mr Siriwardane said.
Therefore, the SLTB had also decided to grant the benefit of the fuel concession to the people by reducing the fare, he said.
The Interim bus fare revision issued by the NTC, the fare stages Rs.12 which was the minimum stage, Rs.15, Rs.20, Rs.34 and Rs.41 would not change, Mr Siriwardane said. (Chaturanga Samarawickrama)

Sovereignty is in  the  people
	
In the Republic of Sri Lanka, Sovereignty is in the people and it is inalienable. Sovereignty includes the powers of government, fundamental rights and the franchise. Vide. Article 3 of the Constitution.
The manner in which these powers are to be exercised and enjoyed is given in Article 4 of the Constitution.
Accordingly, legislative power is exercised by Parliament (Article 4(a)) while the Executive power is exercised by the President (Article 4(b)). These are powers of the people given in trust to the Legislature and the Executive (President). 
The reasons for these are that the people as an entire body cannot, on their own, carry out every executive and legislative function.
A Representative Democracy is therefore, the method by which the people of this country have chosen to exercise these powers. By exercising our franchise we can demonstrate whether or not we endorse what our politicians do.
The removal of the Prime Minister and the appointment of a new Prime Minister is essentially a political project just as much as the 19th amendment was. Nobody should have any illusions on this.
However, when a public debate engaged by Citizens of all strata, confusion is compounded with no conclusion and causes further polarization of an already polarized society. This is particularly so, if we as citizens do not understand who is given what function under our Constitution.
Without attempting to understand the current events in our Country from the standpoint of a political project, some in our society seem to have entered into a never-ending debate, of the legality or otherwise, of the events that unfolded during the past few days and are continuing to be unfolded.
In the Constitution, we have agreed by Article 125(1) that any dispute regarding its interpretation should be resolved by the Supreme Court and certainly not provided for a resolution by public debate.
Thus, whether the acts of the politicians are legally right or wrong is exclusively within the purview of the Supreme Court as Article 125(1) states as follows:
The Supreme Court shall have the sole and exclusive jurisdiction to hear and determine any question relating to the interpretation of the Constitution
However, whether the actions of the politicians are acceptable as morally correct or otherwise, is essentially within our right and can only be subjected to a test at an election.
Dr. Jayampathy Wickremeratne, PC, presently, Member of Parliament of the United National Party, (who is widely acclaimed as a key architect of the 19th Amendment) has himself, with several others, successfully argued in the case reported in 2002 (3) SLR 85 that the sovereignty of the people including the franchise is inalienable.
In the said Judgment, from pages 90-101, the rationale for not allowing the reduction of the power of the President to dissolve Parliament is clearly set out as being for the benefit of the people whose sovereignty is inalienable.
Thus obviously, Dr. Wickremeratne, PC, in his current incarnation has been able to persuade the legislature to enshrine the principle which he stood for in his forthright understanding of the scheme of our Constitution by introducing in Article 33(2)(c) in the most unambiguous form, the Presidents right to prorogue and dissolve Parliament at his discretion.
Article 33(2)(c) after the 19th Amendment reads as follows:
In addition to the powers, duties and functions expressly conferred or imposed on, or assigned to the President by the Constitution or other written Law, the President shall have the power to summon, prorogue and dissolve Parliament
In view of this clear provision contained in Article 33(2)(c), the other power or function of dissolution assigned by Article 70(1) as amended by the 19th Amendment, must be understood as the method of dissolving Parliament when the Legislature wishes it to be dissolved by making a request to the President. 
Thus the right of the President to dissolve upon a request by Parliament is by Proclamation (in Article 70 (1)) , while the unfettered power at the sole discretion of the President to dissolve Parliament under Article 33(2)(c) , would be by way of a simple declaration made by him that Parliament is dissolved.
The wisdom and the intention of the legislature is clearly demonstrated by the new Article 33 (2) ( c ). This power in the President is a totally new and a separate power vested in him which is totally absent in the Constitution prior to the 19th Amendment which is obviously a well thought out and deliberate act on the part of the framers of the amendment.
This is obviously meant to be exercised to prevent instability in the Country such as in a situation which has arisen where there is a claim by the Speaker of Parliament that there is an ambiguity on the state of affairs.
The people of this country would be ever thankful to the collective wisdom of the framers of the 19th Amendment, since they have left open a window of opportunity in favour of the direct exercise of Sovereignty despite the entire amendment being a chaotic compilation.
It is hoped that we do not start another round of debate on whether it is good collective Karma of the Nation or Divine providence that has given us this opportunity.
If the President is certain that his decision of the removal of the Prime Minister would be accepted as morally correct, there is no reason why he should shy away from allowing the people to exercise their franchise by dissolving Parliament in the aforesaid manner and calling for elections.
In the event there is any dispute as to the legality of the removal of the Prime Minister, such has to be decided by the Supreme Court as aforesaid while the morality of it can be decided by the people.
Just as much as a justification was found to bring the 19th Amendment to suit the political project of the President at that time, he has found an interpretation to suit his political project at the present moment.
No one should be surprised or disappointed by his actions. What other way would a politician act other than for self interest
What the President did, perhaps, for self interest, on January 8th 2015 was endorsed by a majority of the people.
Today, one has two Constitutional options. One is to seek redress from Court if one does not agree on the legality. The other is to show displeasure if one does not agree on the morality when exercising franchise, if given an opportunity by the President by dissolving Parliament.
Those who do not agree on the actions of the President must not shy away from the first option and must also press for dissolution of Parliament to exercise the second option.
Instead of doing either, resorting to arguments in the public domain on the Law, merely creates a cacophony which results in social discord.
Therefore, let us end this debate and urge those who have issues on the Law to go to the Supreme Court and for the President to dissolve Parliament to exercise our franchise displaying that we actually care for our Sovereignty.

Speaker has no power to go against President- Nalin de Silva
	
President Maithripala Sirisena has appointed Mahinda Rajapaksa as the new Prime Minister under Sections 42(4) and 43(3) of the Constitution and published it in the Gazette, and therefore Speaker Karu Jayasuriya has to go by the gazette notification, Dr. Nalin de Silva said today.
Asked for a comment on the current political situation, Dr. de Silva who analyzes politics, said the Speaker had no powers from either the Constitution or the Standing Orders of Parliament to go against the President.
The officers of the Parliament and not the Speaker will be responsible for allocating seats in the House to the MPs. The Speaker cannot determine the number of MPs who support Ranil Wickremesinghe or Mahinda Rajapaksa, by counting the heads on the fourteenth or for that matter on any other day. There is no provision for such vote in the Constitution or the standing orders. The UNP cannot insist on such vote as there is no provision in the constitution or the standing orders. All that they can do is to move a vote of no confidence or defeat the budget and realize how they have been boomeranged by the nineteenth amendment. Outside the Parliament, they can go to the Supreme Court and file a human rights violation case. The UNP is not doing either. Instead, they want to use the speaker of the Parliament as the speaker of Siri Kotha, he said.

Speaker's action unlawful; benefits former PM, says NUTA
	
The National University Teachers Association (NUTA) yesterday complained to the Bribery Commission against Speaker Karu Jayasuriya.
NUTA, in its complaint signed by three University academics, said the Speakers acts, done in favour of the wrongful or unlawful benefit or to confer a favour or advantage to former Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, would amount to corruption as defined by Section 70 of the Bribery Act as amended by Act No 20 of 1994.
The NUTA said the Speaker did this by claiming that the Prorogation of Parliament by the President was unconstitutional, knowing very well such to be false in view of the clear provisions given in Article 33(2) (C) and Article 70 of the Constitution whereby unfettered and sole powers of Prorogation of Parliament are conferred on the President.
It said:
The Speaker did this by giving the impression that the former Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe still holds office by public pronouncements, making public pronouncements distorting the provisions of the Constitution and refusal to accept the appointment of the new Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa appointed by the President by arrogating powers not conferred by the Constitution to him.
Karu Jayasuriya while holding the post of the Speaker of Parliament which falls within the definition of a Public Servant in terms of the Bribery (Amendment) Act No. 20 of 1994 has thereby committed, in our view an offence falling within the definition of corruption in terms of Section 70 of the Bribery (Amendment) Act no. 20 of 1994 punishable inter alia by imprisonment up to 10 years upon finding guilty.
The complaint was signed by Prof. Channa Jayasumana, Dr Maduruoya Dhammissara Thera and Senior Lecturer Raja Gunaratne.
