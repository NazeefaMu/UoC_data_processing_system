Premiership given to Ranil to respect democracy - Prez
	
President Maithripala Sirisena, in his address after swearing in Mr. Ranil Wickremesinghe as the new premier, said that he had decided to reappoint UNP Leader Ranil Wickremesinghe as the Prime Minister only because he respected parliamentary traditions.
Otherwise, he said he still remained firm in his stance that Mr. Wickremesinghe should not be given the premiership again even if all 225 MPs voted in favour of him.
?
Full Statement:
I made a statement that I will not give Ranil Wickremesinghe the post of Prime Minister even if a request is made by all the 225 Parliamentarians and it is my own personal political opinion, and my view is still the same, but I have decided to invite Ranil Wickremesinghe as I am a leader, who respects parliamentary tradition and democracy, said President Maithripala Sirisena.
The President made these observations addressing the new Prime Minister and members of the United National Front at the Presidential Secretariat this (16) morning, the swearing in of the new Prime Minister.
According to the constitution, the parliament or the judiciary do not have the authority to nominate a Prime Minister, the President said and added that the executive power is in the hands of the President. However, I decided to appoint Ranil Wickremesinghe as the Prime Minister when 117 MPs extended support to him and I agreed to their decision as a leader who respected the moral and parliamentary tradition, said President Sirisena.
The President said that he took all the steps, including the dissolution of the Parliament, prorogue the Parliament, remove the Prime Minister and the appointment of a new Prime Minister, not according to his sole discretion, but after receiving the advices of legal experts, and further said that those steps were taken for the betterment of the country and there was no intention to violate the constitution of the country. ?
He said that he believed the best solution for the current political turmoil was to go for an election and seek the opinion of the people as the opinion of 15.5 million voters in the country is a more powerful indicator and the epitome of democracy and it is much stronger than the opinion of 122 Members of Parliament. Hence he issued the gazette notification to dissolve Parliament and call for elections, he said.
Even though establishing independent commissions through 19th amendment was a good thing, but on the other hand it has resulted in a political turmoil said the President. He added that postponing the amendment to the Act? related to Commission of Bribery and Corruption for? punishing those who are guilty of the treasury bond scam and to recover stolen money, not allocating ministerial portfolios under a scientific method although it was a campaign promise, the massive fraud in the Central Bank bond issue, losing the support of the Bhikku society, imprisoning soldiers and other short sighted activities were carried on in this government for the past four years where he was thoroughly dissatisfied. He said that all these had impacted severely on the decision taken on the political arena lately.
whichever the accusation may be upon him he has taken decisions on behalf of the country and the people said the President. Some says that an impeachment motion will be taken against him, he pointed out and said that even he was imprisoned he would continue to work and take decisions with pure thoughts on behalf of the country and the people and it will be written in the history in gold. ?
The President, recalling statements made by some speakers recently that he will be killed like Gaddafi by dragging away said that, no one had made such statements for any leader since the era of? J.R. Jayewardene, who was a tough leader, the reason behind this was, if such statement was made, persons who are making those statements knew the depressing fate that they have to face, and he further said that those persons made such statements against him as a result of freedom and democracy he had established in the country.????????????????? ?
President Sirisena further said that his expectation is to take forward the activities of the government without any conflict, and further said that creating of conflicts will prevent the progress of the country and said that to build the country for the future, a political movement free from corruption is needed in the country.
The President also said that the good governance concept, which was not succeeded and it totally destroyed and that could be achieved only through a? political movement which loves the motherland, and know the significance of the local culture and core values of the society.
Later, Mr. Sajith Premadasa, addressing the gathering said that his group, including the UNP will not take actions at any time to bring an impeachment motion against the President, and their expectation? is to take forward the activities of the government in collaboration with the President.

## Title: Ranil sworn in as Prime Minister

Ranil sworn in as Prime Minister
	
Bringing an end to the Constitutional and political uncertainty in the country that lasted over six weeks, UNP Leader Ranil Wickremesinghe took oaths as the Prime Minister at the auspicious time of 11.16 this morning before President Maithripala Sirisena at the Presidential Secretariat in a simple ceremony.
Wickremesinghe was removed from the Premiership unexpectedly and unceremoniously by President Sirisena on October 26 and replaced with former President and Kurunegala District Parliamentarian Mahinda Rajapaksa.
However, Speaker Karu Jayasuriya and the UNF Parliamentary group with the support of the 14 members of the TNA and six members of the JVP refused to acknowledge Rajapaksa as the Prime Minister maintaining that Rajapaksa did not command the confidence of the majority in Parliament.
On November 27 President Sirisena prorogued Parliament until November 16, which was to be met on December 5 to discuss the budget 2019.
In the meantime, the UPFA leaders tried hard to woo MPs from other political parties to their rank to raise the magic number of 113 in Parliament but failed.
On November 2, 119 Members passed a resolution requesting President Sirisena to reconvene Parliament immediately.
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya announced that he would convene Parliament on November 7 under the power vested on him and under the Standing Orders of Parliament and added that Parliament would not accept Rajapaksa as PM because he did not have the majority in Parliament.
On November 14 and 16, Parliament passed two resolutions of No Confidence Motions (NCM) against Rajapaksa and both were rejected by President Sirisena and the UPFA.
In the meantime, President Sirisena swore-in four UNP members, Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe, Vadivel Suresh, Wasantha Senanayake and Ananda Aluthgamage as ministers in the implied Government.
President Sirisena on November 9, issued a Gazette notification dissolved Parliament with January 5, 2019, as the day of the election.
On November 12, the UNP, TNA, JVP and the SLMC and several individuals and organizations filed 12 Fundamental Rights petitions in the Supreme Court challenging the dissolution.
On the same day, a three-judge bench chaired by Chief Justice Nalin Perera, with the consent of two other justices Prasanna Jayawardana and Priyantha Jayawardana permitting leave to proceed also issued an interim order staying the Gazette notification issued by President Sirisena to dissolve Parliament.
On December 3, 122 Parliamentarians petitioned to the Court of Appeal challenging the authority Mahinda and his purported cabinet functioned in the backdrop of without having a majority in Parliament.
The ruling was issued by Chairman of the Appeals Court P. Padman Surasena and Judge Arjun Obeysekera after considering submissions on the Quo Warranto Writ filed by 122 Members of Parliament.
The Court of Appeal issued an interim injunction against Rajapaksa and his Cabinet from functioning in respective offices, until the 12th of December.
Rajapaksa and his administration on December 4, filed a motion before the Supreme Court challenging the Interim Injunction issued by the Court of Appeal.
On December 14, a seven-judge bench of the Supreme Court chaired by Chief Justice Nalin Perera unanimously ruled that the dissolution of Parliament was unconstitutional.
In a statement, Mahinda Rajapaksa said his group did not agree with the pronouncement made by the Appeals Court.
On December 13, a fuller bench comprising seven Supreme Court judges unanimously ruled that the dissolution of Parliament was unconstitutional and President did not have the power to dissolve Parliament before four-and-a-half years out of the full term of five years, unless a two-thirds of members pass a resolution in Parliament and make a request to do so from President.
By a separate Supreme Court bench of three judges on the same day comprising Justice Eva Wanasundara, Vijith Malalaghoda and Buwaneka Aluvihare refused to vacate the Court of Appeal Stay Order that suspended the functioning in office by Rajapaksa as Prime Minister and his Cabinet.
The Supreme Court also set January 16,17 and 18 of 2019 to consider the appeal by the Rajapaksa team shattering all hopes of Rajapaksa to remain as Prime Minister without any official duty.
He resigned on Saturday paving the way for President Sirisena to reinstate Wickremesinghe as the PM.
Interestingly, this was the 5th time Wickremesinghe was sworn in as Prime Minister of Sri Lanka.
After the swearing-in ceremony at the Presidential Secretariat, Prime Minister Wickremesinghe participated in religious ceremonies and made a brief address to the nation at the Temple Trees.
The media had been barred from officially covering the swearing-in ceremony at the Presidential Secretariat.(Sandun Jayasekera)

Will discuss with TNA,JVP to bring about a political solution-PM
	
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe making a special statement today said that discussions will be held with the Tamil National Alliance (TNA) and Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) to bring about a political solution in which all citizens can live in harmony in a unitary state.
?Even by now, we have initiated the discussions with a number of political parties in respect to abolishing the executive Presidency. And also, we will have discussions with the Tamil National Alliance and Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna to bring about a political solution in which all citizens can live in harmony in a unitary state.,? he said at Temple Trees.
He also stated, ?Our intention is to form a broad alliance to protect democracy. It is only through democratic environment in which the voice of the people is considered and the rights of the people are protected. We can bring about a dignified society where future generation can do without fear.?
The full statement :
It is a pleasure to me to address you once again as the Prime Minister of Sri Lanka. You all know that the basic law of our country is the Constitution. Now we have passed 87 years after we gained franchise. During this whole period the people of this country protected the Constitution. They protected fundamental rights. Whenever there was a threat to the constitution and to the fundamental rights, they came forward to protect them.?
Same thing happened in the Presidential Election in 2016. You all joined hands to end an era in which the Constitution and the rights of the people were suppressed. It is with this intention that we adopted the 19th Amendment to the Constitution in order to protect the rights of the people more and more. I would like to emphasize that democracy will not be strengthened by acting against the constitution.
The Prime Minister of the Country should have the maximum confidence of the Parliament. Without a majority support a Prime Minister cannot bring forward the Country. Similarly, the Prime Minister and the Ministers should vacate their posts when a no confidence motion was passed in Parliament against them. In terms of the Constitution no one has the power to dissolve Parliament until four and half years have lapsed after a Parliament is formed. It can only be done on a resolution passed by two thirds majority in Parliament.
This Constitutional violation cannot be rectified by way of an election. It is also stated in the Judgement of the Supreme Court.?
I would like to quote the following paragraph included in page 85 of the judgement delivered by the Supreme Court.
?It has been said by some of the added Respondent that refusing the Petitioner?s applications will enable a General Election to be held in pursuance of the Proclamation marked ?P1? and, therefore, justified because it will give effect to the franchise of the people. That submission is not correct. Giving effect to the franchise of the people is not achieved by the court permitting a General Election held consequent to dissolution of Parliament which has been effected contrary to the provision of the Constitution. Such a General Election will be unlawfully held and its result will be open to question. A General election will be valid only if it is lawfully held. Thus, a General Election held consequent to dissolution of Parliament which has been done contrary to the provisions of the constitution will not be a true exercise of the franchise of the people.??
I said the same thing on 26th October at Temple Trees. I said that our fight was for the sake of democracy, justice, protection of the Constitution, adherence of the rule of the law and civilized and moral conduct of society. I also said that we would win this fight.?
Even today I am telling the same thing. I will tell the same tomorrow too. I will abide my word. I will do what I say. I say only what I can do.
Most of the people of this country joined together to protect the constitution, democracy, and the rights of the people. Hundred thousand of people who adhere to their conscience came to the forefront of this fight as Sri Lankans, disregarding their race, religion and party politics. Sri Lankans living abroad too supported this move to the best of their ability. They joined this fight on behalf of their country and democracy without any personal gain.?
I take this opportunity to salute them all.
Similarly, I would like to pay my homage to the Maha Sanga and the clergy of other religions who guided us in this endeavor.
The Hon. Speaker, Ministers and the members of the Parliament fully dedicated to uphold the supremacy of the Parliament and democracy. I offer my sincere gratitude to all them. Our judicial institutions including the supreme Court and the Court of Appeal exhibited their independence and the identity to the whole world. I would like to extend my gratitude to the Judiciary as well as to the lawyers who made their legal submissions. And also, I offer my gratitude to the members of the public service, armed services and the Police who upheld the rule of law and justice.?
My gratitude should go to the journalists who fought for the impartiality of Media in the midst of the pressures of errant journalists and to all who toil day and night voluntary to tell the truth to the World through the Social Media.
In January 2015 and August 2015, we gained the mandate of the people to bring about good governance, to preserve the democracy and the Rule of the Law to eliminate frauds and corruptions, to empower Parliament after abolishing the executive presidency and to uphold the sovereignty of the people.?
During the past three and half years we have done a lot to the Country.
It is due to progressive steps including the establishment of the independent Commissions that many institutions including the Judiciary could act independently.??
The whole country is enjoying the harvest of the seeds we sawed during the past three and half years. We are happy about that. However, there are things we could not implement in this period. Some work got delayed. We could not finalize some work. But we haven?t lost our dedication determination. We are determined to rectify our shortcomings. We will take the steps to expedite the litigation regarding frauds and corruptions. We have created an environment in which different ethnic groups can live together in harmony and co existence. We will dedicate ourselves to maintain harmony among different ethnic groups.??
Now, we should go forward.
Even by now, we have initiated the discussions with a number of political parties in respect to abolishing the executive Presidency. And also, we will have discussions with the Tamil National Alliance and Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna to bring about a political solution in which all citizens can live in harmony in a unitary state.?
I didn?t take any steps to enter into any agreement with the LTTE in order to win the Presidential Election. In the past I dedicated the victory in the Presidential Election for the sake of my motherland. I haven?t yet changed that stand.?
Our intention is to form a broad alliance to protect democracy. It is only through democratic environment in which the voice of the people is considered and the rights of the people are protected. We can bring about a dignified society where future generation can do without fear.
Our effort is to create a strong democratic environment that any external force cannot suppress. My heart-felt wish is to create a such a Sri Lanka. You all wish for such a country. It is the hope of all Sri Lankans.?
Therefore, I appeal to all of you to forget all differences and join hands with this broad alliance, for the sake of our motherland, democracy rights of the people and to bring about a free country for the unborn generation.?
Let us allow our heart-felt wish.?
Thank you all.
