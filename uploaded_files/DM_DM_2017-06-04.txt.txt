As flood recede, long-term monster show up
	
Floods in most of the areas were receding as of today giving way to the authorities to focus on long term issues, whilst the death toll remained at 212 with 79 persons were still reported missing.
One of the freshly noticed long-term effect is the effect the floods had on the low grown tea plantations.
Many of the tea bushes in the Galle, Kalutara and Ratnapura Districts, which were affected by the floods are covered with mud to date, a Minister said.

Basmathi Rice imported from Pakistan suitable for consumption - Ministry
	
Ministry of Industry and Commerce said today that the recent consignment of 'Basmathi' rice imported from Pakistan by Sathosa is suitable for consumption. The Ministry was compelled to issue a statement following a campaign launched by social media to defame the state retail super market chain.
In a statement, the ministry said there is a ongoing campaign with vested interests on social media to damage public trust of Sathosa super markets.
Meanwhile the Daily Mirror learns that this rice variety was not popular among the consumers due to the news carried by online media calling it Plastic Rice .
The statement said 20 metric tons of rice stock has been imported on May 15 this year however it has went through the stipulated protocols of quality assurance tests before it released to the market.
It further said, a food technologist has issued a clearance certificate stating that the consignment does not contain any harmful chemical substance which is unfit for human consumption.
The ministry also warned the public the particular imported rice is stickier after it cooked.
Therefore the ministry requested the public not to mislead on such baseless allegations as the Sathosa is always committed to give the best products at a lowest rate. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

Dr. Kahandaliyanage responds to GMOA
	
The recently appointed Competent Authority to manage Disaster Response Activities of the Health Ministry Dr. Athula Kahandaliyanage refuted allegations made by the Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) last week that he was unfit for the post.
In a media statement he said that he was surprised to see the allegations made by a trade union requesting President to rescind his appointment made by Minister of Health to function as the Competent Authority to manage the Disaster Response activities of the health sector.
He said:
The Hon Health Minister requested me to coordinate and lead the disaster response activities of the Health Ministry giving guidance and support to the Health Ministry Programme considering the vast experience I have gained in my career in Sri Lanka and in the UN in disaster management and response and also considering the valuable service I have rendered as the then Director General of Health Services and Permanent Secretary / Heath.
I was the longest and youngest serving DGHS and I had the rare opportunity of leading the Tsunami response and reconstruction activities in 2005, the worst disaster that has ever struck this country.
Thereafter, as Permanent Secretary of Health I lead the successful campaign conducted by the state to provide health services to a large numbers of internally displaced people during the final stages of the war in the North in 2009.
Both these- disaster management and response efforts -were hailed and commended by the international community and also by the Director General of WHO, who came from Geneva to visit the disaster affected areas in Sri Lanka. I also received a special award for that work by Her Excellency the then President of Sri Lanka.
In recognition of my contributions to the management of these national calamities and also my service to the national health services of Sri Lanka, I was awarded the rare honour by the World Health Organization by appointing me as its Director in charge of the Department of Emergency and Disaster Management, Sustainable Development, Environmental Health, NCDs, Mental Health and Health Systems for the South East Asia Region, which is the largest of the six WHO regions in the world covering 26% of world's population, based in New Delhi.
I served in these capacities for over four years and gathered a lot of experience in disaster management. I am bold and proud to state that I am therefore, competent and qualified to serve in this capacity above anyone else in Sri Lanka today and I consider it my utmost duty to step forward and offer my services at a time of national crisis.
I am also proud to state that I have done so without any remuneration using my own personal funds and I am proud that I got an opportunity to do so. Since the Ministry Secretary and the DGHS have both retired recently the Hon Minister requested me to help the Ministry to coordinate and manage the disaster response work as a service to the country. I thank the Hon Health Minister for using my services at a time of crisis. I happy to state that I was commended by the Health Ministry officials and the UN and other relevant agencies for conducting this work well.
I also serve as the Chairman of Sri Jayawardenepura Hospital helping the government to improve that hospital which I have done very successfully as shown by the performance indicators, during the past two years. I was appointed to this position by His Excellency and the Hon Minister of Health.
The salary I am entitled as Chairman/SJGH, I have dedicated to a hospital fund which pays bills of those who cannot afford. I consider this work without a pay, as another opportunity to serve my motherland who gave me free education to become a doctor. Never in my tenure at SJGH have I done any marketing and branding of any dairy products in the hospital. The staff would vouch for this.
In my retirement after returning to Sri Lanka I was offered to serve on the Board of Directors of the leading dairy company which provides the much required and recommended dairy nutrition especially liquid milk to our people. It is also investing heavily on the local dairy drive of the government.
I am proud to state that this company does not import or sell infant milk foods that violate the breast feeding code and campaign of the WHO and that of Sri Lanka. It respects and honours the national policy and its efforts to promote breast feeding in Sri Lanka.
On the contrary this company has been supporting and sponsoring the breast feeding campaigns conducted by the government working with all the relevant leading professional bodies, over the last few years. It has spent millions of rupees to promote breast feeding in Sri Lanka.
It is misleading to state that the WHO does not approve anyone working in a dairy industry to get involved with disaster management work. It's only the infant food advertising that the WHO discourages in its breast feeding code. It is unethical and unprofessional for anyone responsible to mislead the policy makers and the public making such frivolous and baseless statements in an incriminatory manner.
l would appreciate if the authors of this misleading campaign got their facts straight before writing such irresponsible statements I feel sorry for their ignorance and hope they would act in a more professional, responsible, and an ethical manner in the future. -Dr. Athula Kahandaliyanage, Chairman Sri Jayawardenepura Hospital.

Expressway not cause of floods: Vajira
	
Minister of Home Affairs Vajira Abeywardene today dismissed the claims made by his Cabinet colleague Patali Champika Ranawaka that the Southern Expressway had been the major cause for the recent floods.
Some say that the Southern Expressway may have had a major impact on the recent floods but the real issue is mismanagement of rivers in the area, Minister Abeywardene said.
Asked whether he would rate the statement made by Minister Ranawaka as a baseless one, Mr. Abeywardene said he would not call it a baseless one.
Everyone has a right to express her or his ideas but what is important is to avoid natural disasters in the future, he said. (Yohan Perera)

Flood hit areas safe from dengue epidemic: Health Min.
	
While denying the Government Medical Officers Associations (GMOA) allegations over shortage of medicine prescribed to Dengue patients, the Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine Ministry yesterday said that, so far there is no threat of Dengue epidemic level in flood hit areas in the country.

The GMOA on last Friday, revealed of a shortage in Dextran a medicine administered to Dengue patients said the ministry has imported an inferior quality drug from India which the doctors are refusing to give to their patients. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

JVP calls for debate on disaster
	
The Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) had requested for an immediate Parliamentary debate on the current floods and landslide disaster, party sources said today.
Sources said the party leader and Chief Opposition Whip had already written to Speaker Karu Jayasuriya requesting for a debate.
Meanwhile, JVP MP Bimal Ratnayake told a news briefing yesterday that the plantations along the central hills had been the cause of the recent disaster.
Development was carried out in this country by safeguarding the central hills for more than 2,000 years. However, this tradition changed after 1815 with the beginning of cultivation in the area, Mr. Ratnayake said.
He said the leaders, who ruled this country after the colonial period continued the ways of the British, even after the country gaining Independence.
The JVP said mismanagement of the disaster would result in a delay in full restoration of peoples lives.
JVP MP Sunil Handunetti said the management of disaster hit areas had not improved even after the increase of relief workers in the Kalutara, Ratnapura and Matara Districts.
It was highlighted that it would take a considerable time for the low-grown tea industry to pick up.
Mr. Handunetti said the tea plantations had been destroyed by the floods.
He said his party had serious questions to raise on flood relief and would raise those in Parliament this week. (Yohan Perera)

London attack: Six killed in vehicle and stabbing incidents
	
Six people have been killed in an attack in central London in which three assailants were shot dead by police, Scotland Yard has said.
A white van hit several pedestrians on London Bridge just after 22:00 BST.
Three men then left the vehicle and stabbed a number of people in Borough Market, an area known for its restaurants and bars.
Armed officers confronted and shot three male suspects within eight minutes.
Met Police Assistant Commissioner Mark Rowley said: "The suspects were wearing what looked like explosive vests but these were later established to be hoaxes."
He said it was currently believed there were only three attackers involved.
London Ambulance Service said at least 30 people have been taken to hospital.
The British Transport Police said one of its officers was seriously injured after being stabbed as he responded to the incident, but his condition was not said to be life-threatening.
Prime Minister Theresa May described the incidents as "dreadful events" and will chair a meeting of the government's Cobra emergency committee later on Sunday.
She added: "I can confirm that the terrible incident in London is being treated as a potential act of terrorism."
London Mayor Sadiq Khan called it "a deliberate and cowardly attack on innocent Londoners".
Eyewitnesses told BBC home affairs correspondent Tom Symonds they saw people getting out of the van after the attack on the bridge and running towards Borough Market.
Gunshots were later heard in the area while one social media user posted a photograph appearing to show one of the attackers lying on the ground outside a pub in the food market, with what seemed to be canisters strapped to his body.
The attack comes almost two weeks after 22 people died in a suicide bombing at a concert in Manchester. In March, five people died in London when a car was driven at pedestrians on Westminster Bridge and a police officer was stabbed outside Parliament.
The BBC's Tom Symonds said a security guard who oversees a number of pubs in the London Bridge area said he saw four people stabbed by three attackers.
BBC reporter Holly Jones, who was on the bridge at the time of the attack, said a van driven by a man was "probably travelling at about 50 miles an hour" before it hit a number of people.
"He swerved right round me and then hit about five or six people. He hit about two people in front of me and then three behind," Ms Jones told the BBC News Channel.
