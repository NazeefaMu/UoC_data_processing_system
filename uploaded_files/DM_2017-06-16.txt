CMA proposes mental health assessment for police officers
	
Police officers who lose their temper while on duty should undergo a mental health assessment on a regular basis to prevent unnecessary assaults on motorcyclists, the Ceylon Motorcyclists' Association (CMA) said yesterday.
They submitted a video clip to IGP Pujith Jayasundara that went viral on social media showing a traffic police officer attacking a motorcyclist.
CMA Secretary Chirantha Amarasinghe said a few mentally ill patients attached to the police department tarnished its reputation by conducting themselves in an unruly manner.
Posting a video of a motorcyclist being assaulted by two traffic police officers last Monday, the CMA requested relevant authorities to initiate an investigation into the police officers behaviour.
Responding to these allegations, Police Spokesman Priyantha Jayakody said the police personnel would undergo a training programme which would help them control their emotions.
He said the Police Department did not consider the statements made by certain groups seriously and that the CMA was not in a position to advise the police.
We believe our officers are receiving fair training. Therefore, we deny the charges levelled by the CMA. They want to create a tense atmosphere among the people. They also try to advise the President at times, DIG Jayakody said.
He said the Police Department was bound to maintain Law and Order, and was not concerned about any baseless allegations levelled by these groups. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

Development that never took place 'change' in Sri Lanka means 'no change'
	
Buying power in this consumer society is not that of the poor who buy to live-to exist. But buying power is that extra heavy spending for the extra comfort in topping up a comfortable life. 
In January 2015, something unique happened. People voted out President Rajapaksa to install a new President. On January 9, Maithripala Sirisena was sworn in. And then, without a Parliamentary election, the corrupt partnered the would be corrupt to form a new Government. It is now the most corrupt Government, accused of two mega Bond Scams in one year. 
Since President Jayewardene established an open market from 1978 with trade liberalising all these Governments have been corrupt with increasing zeal. All through these 40 years, we were thus ruled by both mainstream parties separately for 38 years and for more than two and a half years for now, by this unholy alliance of both the UNP and the SLFP as a good governance (Yahapalanaya) Government. 
In all these 40 years leaving aside all mega corruptions, nepotism, political arrogance and inefficiency in administration, with every change of Government, the rural folk, thats 70.4 per cent of the population of this country, Sinhala, Tamil and Muslims all included, lived outside the main market. 
They still live in a peripheral, slow moving and almost stagnant market. They dont have the buying power -the extra rupee-to be of any worth in a busy and brisk consumer society, driven by investments for big profits.

Buying power in this consumer society is not that of the poor who buy to live-to exist. But buying power is that extra heavy spending for the extra comfort in topping up a comfortable life. 
In this free market economy, freedom of choice in reality is not for the individual consumer to spend, but for the investor businessman to choose where to invest for bigger profits. 
Given the choice, apart from exporting to the global market, they would serve the rich in big city markets. For these markets, the consumer thinking is steamrolled by heavy advertising for increased demand of products and services. 
Skylines and road facades say it all. 
In Colombo, tall high rise buildings for commercial purposes, mushrooming condominiums and apartment housing, large shopping malls with designer wear, expensive restaurants with Manchurian to Spanish and Western cuisine, departmental store chains, modern private hospitals, well equipped gyms for exercising, toll levying car parks and well laid out large walking and cycling paths for the health conscious show the economic growth of a free market economy. 
Neo-liberalism is all about matching the buying power (demand) of the growing urban middle class and the small super rich with that of supply. 
The expanding Colombo city is everything symbolic about the culture of consumerism with lavish spending. 
In Colombo, tall high rise buildings for commercial purposes, mushrooming condominiums and apartment housing, large shopping malls with designer wear
This visual and the feel of fast moving life of consumerism are totally absent in Moneragala or Hambantota, or in Polonnaruwa or Kegalle. 
There isnt a rich middle class that can generate profits for such investments in these rural societies. 
It therefore serves no purpose for investors to go to Moneragala with designer-wear shopping outlets. No purpose in opening up high end restaurants in Hambantota. 
A way out therefore would be to: 1. Have a carefully regulated market economy that will not turn citizens into robot like consumers, in an atomised society 
2. Plan and reform education, health and commuter transport with greater responsibility held by the State 
3. Channel investments to planned and identified economic sectors with strict conditions laid down on employee rights and environmental safety 
4. Restructure lower tiers of elected representative bodies like local government and provincial councils as participatory democratic structures of governance 
5. Ensure public policy making is open, participatory and within a national development plan that is socially discoursed and adopted with short and long term programmes and proposals. 
Heavy investments do not go to Polonnaruwa for modern private hospitals, despite medical data on increasing CKD (Chronic Kidney Disease of uncertain aetiology) patients. 
It is not just cash flow and profits that define neo-liberal economics. It is the marginalising of rural life, the neglect of once State funded priorities like education, health and transport that defines neo-liberalism. With that is created an ideology that sustains neo-liberal markets. 
The ideology that explains consumer choice as democracy and freedom and justifies free and open markets. 
Yet, within that economic democracy and freedom, no government can plan for sustainable economic growth with equal opportunities for all insocial development. 
Governments are held responsible in planning to attract more and more investors for export promotion. This formula is still being chanted as the God given Mantra for development. 
Within this planning, governments dont plan for quality improvement of healthcare, of education, of commuter transport, or even for efficient public administration. The logic of a free market economy is that, the consumer decides what he or she wants and that not only decides supply, but also
the quality. 
During the last 40 years, Sri Lanka was taken on this route to an elusive world of development. 
Along this route implementing of labour laws was seen to be gradually relaxing. 
Amendments to industrial laws and also laws for easy access and ownership of land were being drafted and enacted. Everything had to be business friendly for economic growth. With guarantees by successive governments, investors who came to collaborate with local businesses for export manufacture, were legally allowed untold and unaudited benefits and profits at the expense of public income. 
What they earned during their operations here and what the people had to forego as tax and duty incomes have never been assessed. In terms of loss to the people on tax holidays and duty waivers given to investors, it could well be over a couple of trillions of rupees. 
The neo-liberal economic model for development has thus left many issues that wouldnt ever be resolved within an increasingly liberalised market, the type Wickremesinghe leadership in government is desperately pushing for. 
Free market has resulted in the richest 20 per cent of the population accruing 52.9 per cent of the national income, while the 20 per cent at the bottom is left with only 4.5 per cent going by 2013 numbers, according to the Central Bank of SL Annual Report of 2016. 
The report also says in 2014, the GDP per capita according to provinces had been Rs. 428,212 in Uva, Rs.360,876 in Sabaragamuwa and Rs.417,225 in North Central province while in the Western province it had been almost two fold with Rs.734,094. 
This suffocating disparity has left its mark on education, health, public transport and on cultural life of the rural poor. 
In Uva 6.5 per cent had no schooling. In Central province it is 5.2 per cent and 4.5 per cent in Sabaragamuwa (CBSL Annual Report, 2016). While in Colombo district there are 185 medical doctors for 100,000 populations, Kalutara, Kegalle, Puttalam, Ratnapura, Moneragala and Mullaithivu have only 50 to 60 medical doctors. In Nuwara Eliya it is 38 doctors. So, is the disparity in distribution of trained nurses (Annual Health Bulletin  2014). 
These major disparities have been growing at different rates for 40 years. A proven fact, this neo-liberal economic model under any government can only keep increasing inequality and disparities in society.  It is on top of all these, mega corruption in the political establishment, serious lapses in maintaining law and order, inefficiency with corruption in the bureaucracy is dumped on. It is on top of all these that Sinhala extremism against minorities is patronised. 
The BBS boss Gnanasara, who reports to Court he is in hospital is still free, while there are four special Police units deployed to arrest him for racial violence and hate speech. 
Ethno-religious polarisation is part of neo-liberalism especially in developing countries, including India under Narendra Modi and in South Asia too.  After the 2008 meltdown of the global neo-liberal economy, efforts by the US and British to prop up their economies by bailing out big business with public funds, the lower middle and the working class population including marginalised groups were frustrated. 
They wanted a way out for safer and secure economic life. Sanders in the US and Corbyn in the UK are clear projections of this growing political dissatisfaction, articulating deviations from the free market economy. 
That remains true for all and Sri Lanka too.  We need to find an alternative to this free market economy that drags us without answers for any of the socio economic and cultural issues, not just under one government but under all successive governments. 
What could that alternate model be 
The Soviet type socialism for sure is no answer. A closed market economy as in 1970-77 in SL was a social burden. 
All or most of these would need a new Constitution.  That too needs public participation in making. Has to be dialogued in society unlike how it is being engineered now in a parliament that has no credibility and also lacks intellectual participation. Social dialogue will not be to the liking of mainstream political parties entrenched in big business, profiting from this free market. 
It is also not possible with corroded thinking in the much splintered Left that remains without attraction and without democratic organisational structures to facilitate serious social dialogue. Thus the question is, where and how could this begin.  It can only begin with dissenting voices outside traditional social and political organisations and in urban society. From among the more mature in the new generation. Pray, it would.

Errant garbage dumpers to be arrested in Colombo
	
The Colombo Municipality together with the Army and environmental police will police the city after dark in a bid to arrest errant individuals dumping garbage within the Colombo city limits.
The programme which was launched last night was a knee-jerk reaction to individuals dumping large bags of garbage inside the city during the night.
Colombo Municipality Commissioner V. K. A Anura speaking to the Daily Mirror said the garbage was not segregated and often brought into the city from the suburbs.
These piles of garbage are not segregated and since local government authorities no longer collect garbage that are not segregated, those who dont segregate their waste dump it in Colombo at night, he said.
The recent occurrence saw large piles of garbage across the city with the CMC forced to clean up at least 200 metric tonnes a day.
We collected at least 750 tonnes of garbage from roadsides this week. We are certain the garbage is not produced from residential areas in Colombo as most of the waste we collected had come from large production facilities such as farms, Mr. Anura added.
When questioned as to why individuals would want to dump garbage in the streets of Colombo after dark, Anura explained that the CMC was the only local government authority to completely clear streets of garbage. They know we will clear it all, which is why they dump their garbage in the city after dark, he said. (Nabeela Hussain)

Even without DUP deal, May to press ahead with Queens speech
	

(Daily Mail, London), 15 June 2017 -  Theresa May will unveil a Queens Speech next Wednesday even if there is no formal deal with the DUP to prop her up in power. 
The new governments legislative programme will be put forward two days later than originally planned in the wake of the dramatic election result. 
A senior Tory source said talks with the Northern Ireland party had been positive and there was broad agreement on the principles of the Speech - but nothing is yet set in stone.Indicating that Mrs May will press ahead even without an agreement, the Tory source said: We are confident there is sufficient support across the House for the Queens Speech. 
Meanwhile, Mrs May is today hosting Sinn Fein, the DUP and other parties at No10 in a bid to restore the Stormont assembly after its acrimonious collapse in January.Some Tories - including ex-PM John Major - have been alarmed that an arrangement with the DUP would harm the Good Friday Agreement by undermining the UK governments claim to be impartial.

Govt. ignored issues triggered by SAITM: FUTA
	
The Federation of University Teachers Association (FUTA) yesterday charged that the government ignored issues triggered by the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM) in the state medical education sector .
It charged that the government let it to develop into a crisis situation in medical education at state universities. Once the crisis was developed, it, said the government was trying to capitalize on it for setting up private medical colleges.
FUTA Secretary Prof. Arjuna Parakrama told the Daily Mirror that the government had attempted to weaken state universities while creating a market to establish private universities.
The government is in need to gain income in terms of taxes by establishing private medical universities. They are least concerned about the quality of the education which would be offered from such universities, he said.
He said the government had not attempted to fill vacancies created at the state universities even though they had guaranteed of increasing the enrollments to state universities.
He also said there were about 2000 vacancies at state universities during past years as per the past records of the University Grants Commission (UGC) and added that the same fact had been accepted by the Prime Minister as well as the Higher Education Minister in Parliament.
The crisis in the education and higher education sector is a result of considering education as a profit oriented consumer good, he said. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)

ISIS recruiter targets SL, Indian, Bdeshi youths
	
A fugitive chief recruiter of the Islamic State in the Indian subcontinent has targeted youths from India, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka to involve them with the global terror outfit ISIS, the Daily Star reported on Friday quoting the NDTV.
According to the article, Mohammed Shafi Armar who is a tech savvy, has been operating on Facebook and other personal messenger services to allegedly contact, brainwash and recruit youths from the three nations.
He has been named a Specially Designated Global Terrorist by the US on Thursday, becoming the first Indian leader of the terror outfit against whom America has sponsored sanctions.
The US State Treasury Department, while updating its list of Specially Designated Global Terrorists (SDGT), has included Armar, who is a native of Karnataka, clearing the way for sanctions against him.
An Interpol Red Corner notice is also pending against the 30-year-old Armar, who has many aliases like Chhote Maula, Anjan Bhai and Yousuf al-Hindi.
"Mohammed Shafi Armar is a leader and head recruiter in India for the Foreign Terrorist Organisation (FTO) and Specially Designated Global Terrorist (SDGT) group, ISIS," the State Department said.
"He has cultivated a group of dozens of ISIS sympathisers who are involved in terrorist activities across India, such as plotting attacks, procuring weapons, and identifying locations for terrorist training camps," said the statement.
Armar was said to have left for Pakistan along with his elder brother after the crackdown on Indian Mujahideen cadres.
After a fight with Bhatkal brothers, including Riyaz, the founder of Indian Mujahideen, in Pakistan, Armar is believed to have created Ansar ul Tawhid, which later pledged its allegiance to the ISIS, NDTV reports.
His links to the ISIS were also the highlight of the interrogation of Yasin Bhatkal, who was arrested near the Nepal border in 2013.
Armar first came on the radar of investigation agencies when the NIA was probing suspected ISIS cadres in Ratlam of Madhya Pradesh.
During the interrogation of alleged IS operatives, it emerged that Armar was motivating and radicalising Muslim youths in India.
He was said to have been recruiting youths for the Jund ul Khalifa-e-Hind through online radicalisation.

Lankan forests facing imminent threat  due to deforestation
	
Sri Lanka is recognized as the Pearl of the Indian Ocean in terms of its strategic location and magnificent splendour. It is absolutely evident that Sri Lanka consists of a variety of birds, animals and plants, which further enhances its beauty.
Between the year 2000 and 2016 the rate of deforestation has been 1.46% per annum over the reasons like massive development projects, large scales of plantations and resettling programmes
	Legal action against projects like port city, Uma Oya, the construction in Wilpattu of resettling sites for Muslims, and the Rideemaliyadda Sugar Factory
	Loss of forests has a major impact on global warming and biodiversity; consequently increasing Carbon dioxide, soil erosion, risk of earth slips and spring water drying
It has 751 known species of amphibians, birds, mammals and reptiles of which 21.7% are endemic, and over 3,314 species of vascular plants, of which 26.9% are endemic. We in fact are blessed to be born in a nation like this with serenity and peace. At the same time, we are fortunate to experience pleasant warmth of breath on account of the vast natural forests located on this land.
On the other hand; it is our prime duty to protect our land and hand it over to the future generation with more value. But, it seems that only a few are interested in caring for the worth of the natural forests which are at drastic risk. It is obvious that the natural forests are at imminent threat as deforestation is taking place with no concern for the conservation of the environment. 
The estimated natural forests in Sri Lanka covers nearly 18 percent of the land area. They are mainly situated in the dry zone of the island. Now, the natural forests are being gradually cleared for particular reasons with the utmost approval of the government
Deforestation in Sri Lanka is one of the most serious environmental issues that have appeared to be rapidly for past few years. Sri Lankas forest cover, which was around 49% in 1920, has fallen to approximately 18% by now. Between 2000 and 2016 the rate of deforestation growing 1.46% per annum. Sri Lankan natural forests are in severe danger due to the deforestation for purposes like massive development projects, large scales of plantations and resettling programmes, an environmental organization called the Centre for Environment Justice told the Daily Mirror. 
The estimated natural forests in Sri Lanka cover nearly 18 percent of the land area. They are mainly situated in the dry zone of the island. Now, the natural forests are being gradually cleared for particular reasons with the utmost approval of the government, the Legal Officer of Centre for Environment Justice Sugath Atapattu said. 
He categorically mentioned the consequences that we have to undergo, if this act is carried out continuously. He said that however the repercussions seem to be inevitable as deforestation is obviously visible in this context. 
Loss of forests has a major impact on global warming and biodiversity; consequently increase of the Carbon dioxide, soil erosion, risk of earth slips, spring water drying and influence towards ground water are the negative outputs of deforestation, he added. 
They have been very vocal on this issue and have taken legal actions against the ongoing projects like port city, Uma Oya project, the project of construction in Wilpattu of resettling sites for Muslims displaced during the civil war, and the Rideemaliyadda Sugar Factory. 
He stressed in a special manner the disadvantage of Rideemaliyadda Sugar Factory through which 85 percent is gained by a foreign company and a trifle is gained by Sri Lanka. He further stated that it has been internationally identified that a single plantation like sugar-cane has a huge impact on the earth owing to its absorptive nature. 
Approximately 65,000 acres have already been allocated for this gigantic project and no government official has been concerned about the disaster that would cause in terms of this project, he emphasized. 
Meanwhile, Centre for Environment Justice Executive Director Hemantha Withanage said that they have taken steps to put an end to this deforestation which has caused a large destruction to the forests and the country as well. He stated that the latest report of the UN-REDD depicts the whole scenario of this topic and how important it is to protect the remaining forest for the future.

In conclusion, it should be noteworthy to fathom that it is we who will suffer due to this tragedy in the long run. Therefore, as the governing body of Sri Lanka, parliament should take prompt action with the collaboration of the environmental organizations pertaining to those who involve in these activities. Otherwise, the repercussions would be more serious than we experience now.

Let flood affected students sit A/L exam next year: PM
	
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said today the advanced level students in flood and landslide-affected areas should be allowed to sit the GCE Advanced Level (A/L) exam next year instead of this year.
He said this when he was informed by the divisional secretaries in the Matara District that students who were expecting to sit the GCE A/L exams this year were still in a state of shock having lost their study material.
"Let them sit the exam next year and allow them to sit for it three times," he said while pointing out that these students too should be allowed to sit the exam three times -- twice from school and once privately as usual.
The district divisional secretaries who described the impact on the students in the Matara District said some 36,000 children in the district had lost all their books and stationery in the floods that ravaged the area.
However, a proposal made by one government official that the affected students be allowed to make four attemptw to get through the A'L exam was dismissed. The Prime Minister said implementing such a proposal would be complicated as procedures had to be changed to implement it.
It was revealed that some 1,980 teachers and 38 school principals in the district had been displaced while some of the residents of Pasgoda, Welipitiya, Malimbada in the Matara district still live in fear because these areas have been identified as vulnerable and might have to be resettled elsewhere.
Government officials said about Rs.4,000 million was needed to repair roads destroyed by the disaster while nearly 1,902 acres of tea plantations had been destroyed.
The Prime Minister stressed the need for finalizing estimates to rebuild roads in all disaster-hit areas at it was essential to present them to the donors to obtain foreign aid.
We must expedite the process of preparing estimates as we might lose foreign assistance in the event a disaster takes place in another country," he said and added that he would meet the ministers of plantation industries and finance to assist the business establishments and tea plantations which were affected.

Mount of Mercury
	
Human hand  trailblazer of human civilization  Part 13


BY A.S. Fernando.
The prominent part at the base of the 4th Finger or the Finger of Mercury is called the Mount
of Mercury.
Indicator of prosperity and affluence
This Mount represents the prosperity and affluence ofthe owner.
Mercurians - those with a well-developed Mount of Mercury - can go bad as cheats and fraudsters. But the good Mercurians have the potential to become great scientists, eminent lawyers, outstanding politicians, successful businessmen, and much sought after-physicians.
Endowed with wit, sharp intelligence and circumspection
They are endowed with sharp intelligence, wit, circumspect
and eloquence.
Mercurians are methodical in their work. They are keen on scientific research and are born mathematicians.
They would make a success in the medical profession especially when the Mount is marked by three vertical lines and there is a well-developed Mount of Jupiter.
A Mercurian with a long pointed first phalanx and short nails of the finger would make his mark as a barrister of law.
Mercurians are psychic and are adept at influencing people. They shine in literary fields as well.
Mercurians are active both mentally and physically.
They are good at games and sports where skill and dexterity rather than physical strength
are required.
A single vertical line, a star, a square, a triangle or a trident on the Mount is considered good. A grille, an island, a cross, a dot or cross bars on the Mount signify either bad traits in the character of the owner or his health problems.

Mystery of love or dislike at first sight
	

Have you had the experience of taking an instant liking for a person whom you have met for the first time in life Asked this question, most would immediately say: Yes.

Attraction and repulsion
By the same token, we all, no doubt, may have had the experience of taking an instant dislike for a person we have met for the first time in life for reasons you cannot explain.
There can be many factors accounting for our instant attraction to some unknown person or an instant dislike for a complete stranger. The Science of Numerology helps us in several ways to unravel this mystery shrouding our emotional reaction to a person atfirst sight.
According to Numerology, one reason for our unreasonable reaction to strangers at the first encounter is the affinity or the clash among numbers influencing us in a mysterious way.

Date of birth and basic numbers
The date of birth is one of the factors that explains our strange unreasonable reaction to a stranger.
For the immediate purpose of explaining the affinity or the conflict among numbers, let us take the date of birth without the month and the years. Before, proceeding further, I think we have to understand what a basic number is and how to reduce a number with several digits into a basic number.
Numbers 1 to 9 are basic numbers, because all bigger numbers are produced by an arrangement of numbers from 1 to 9. We do not include the zero (0) because it represents a negative aspect in this context.
Now the question arises us to how to reduce a larger number having several digits into a basic number.

Suppose you are asked to reduce the following number into a basic number,
 3 4 5 6 7 2 1 9
Add up these figures
3 + 4 + 5 + 6 +7 + 2 + 1 9  = 37
Again add up 3 + 7 = 10
Again add up 1 + 0 = 1
Therefore, the basic number of 34567219 is 1.
We were speaking about the affinity or the clash between numbers in relation to the date of birth and applying the basic number rule only to the date overlooking the month and year for our immediate purpose. There is a maximum of 31 days in a month and the question of reducing the first nine day-dates does not arise as these dates carry only one digit and are basic numbers themselves. The other dates can be reduced to basic numbers as follows:
      10 = 1 + 0 = 1
      11 = 1 + 1 = 2
      12 = 1 + 2 = 3
      13 =  1 = 3 = 4
      14 =  1 + 4 = 5
      15 =  1+ 5 = 6
      16 =  1+ 6 = 7
      17 =  1+ 7 = 8
      18 =  1 + 8 = 9
        19 =  1 + 9 = 10 = 1 + 0 = 1`
      20 =  2 + 0 = 2
Thus we reduce all birth dates to basic numbers from 1 to 9. For example, a person born on the 1st, 10th, 19th or 28th of the month is a Number 1 person. A person born on the 7th, 16th, or 25th of the month is a Number 7 person.
Thus you will understand people born on different days of the month fall into nine groups according to the nine basic numbers. If you make an experiment with the birth dates of your friends, you will certainly find a strong affinity between those in a particular number group.
Numerologists, for the purpose of determining affinity between different date persons on a wider range have further grouped together the nine number people as follows:
(1) (a) 1 and 4 (b) 2 and 7
(2)       3, 6, and 9
(3)       5
(4)       8
These groupings show No: 1 people have affinity not only with No: 1 people, but also with No: 4 and
vice versa.
No: 2 people have affinity with No: 7 people and vice versa. No: 3 people have affinity with No: 6 and No: 9 people and vice versa and No: 5 and No: 8 people have no affinity with any other Number group people.

Nepal delays polls in flashpoint province
	

KATHMANDU AFP June15, 2017-  Nepal postponed local elections in one flashpoint province on Thursday in an attempt to appease a party representing the countrys Madhesi minority that had threatened to boycott the polls. 
It is the latest in a series of delays to the countrys first local elections in 20 years, a key step in a drawn-out post-civil war peace process. 
A first phase of elections was held successfully last month in three provinces. 
But repeated threats of protest by the Madhesi, an ethnic minority group living along the border with India, has led to elections in the remaining four provinces being repeatedly pushed back.

On capitulating to headless cadavers
	
Populists, like elites, centrists, liberals, and conservatives, come in different shades. Some are honest and sincere, others are not. Some like to mince rhetoric with action, others do not. It doesnt take a political thinker to figure out that over the past 50 years, no politician worth his or her salt has got into power without resorting to rhetoric. What differentiates them from one another, consequently, is their ability to transform that into viable, feasible, and affirmative political action.

The problem with our meritocrats is that they are disconnected from the pulse of their own people. Whether they intend it or not, they promote a variant of populism that thrives on lies, propaganda, and unconvincing rhetoric. Once elected to power, they often always go back on those lies and envelope the democratic process with an equally lamentable variant of anti-populism. The 1994 election opened out like that: it had as much to do with the wild promises dished out by the Peoples Alliance as it had with the complacency of the UNP. What transpired after 1994 until 2005, with the PAs equally wild flirtations with privatisation, de-regulation, and shady deals, says a lot about the sincerity of those who made those promises in the first place.

This rather schizophrenic cycle of popular rhetoric and unpopular action has governed our country for over 50 years. Most commentators attribute it to 1956. That is not so. The fact is that even those hailed as the fathers and mothers of our independence werent untainted in that regard. Entire collectives were disenfranchised, political platforms were premised on the Aryan origins of the Sinhalese, and the great game of being more-racialist-than-thou was played by our leaders long
before 1956. 
The problem with our meritocrats is that they are disconnected from the pulse of their own people. Whether they intend it or not, they promote a variant of populism that thrives on lies, propaganda, and unconvincing rhetoric
I believe it was Gunadasa Amarasekara who once described the SLFP as a headless cadaver. In Amarasekaras book, S. W. R. D. Bandaranaike was the political successor to Anagarika Dharmapala, despite how incongruous the formers personal life was with his public. But considering that latter point, I would wish to contend that Bandaranaikes great achievement lay elsewhere: apart from opening the government to the people (thereby earning the epithet ape anduwa), he bequeathed to our country a generation of leaders who, like populists elsewhere, were able to cloak their anti-populist streak with rhetoric, centering more often than not on issues of race, faith, and the vulnerability of our sovereignty. This merits further scrutiny and comment.

Historically, in other countries populism was the inevitable consequence of authoritarianism. The highly confucianist societies of East Asia, much of continental Europe, and even the United Kingdom: the flurry of rights-based movements there was the result of the culture of dissent guaranteed by a strong, sometimes ruthless centre, however paradoxical it seems now. In other words, the dissent of the periphery was ensured by the grip of the centre. England could not have experienced the shift to a more democratic parliament without Cromwell. The United States could not have emerged from a slave society without the Civil War and Lincoln. 
For a political structure to ferment dissent, therefore, it must be seen to its maturing, and not stalled midway. Such a truism is hard to sustain in certain other societies, though. Before I come to Sri Lanka, its apt that I consider the Middle-East. 
The tendency of our rulers to compare the present with a supposedly less enlightened past is, not surprisingly, a symptom of their political bankruptcy: they have nowhere else to turn to, so they end up critiquing what went by and has long gone by.
The shift from Nasser to Sadat, from the Shah to the Ayatollah, and from Bhutto to Zia-ul-Haq, signified a shift from secular dictatorships to theocratic autocracies. With the exception of the Shah, who was a political maverick, every other leader in that region in his time governed State-led economies. Despite their starkly religious backgrounds and nationalist sympathies, they were able to transform their polities to fairer, more equal societies free of both fundamentalism and liberalism. Egypts transition to Sadat signalled the end of both equality and secularism: notwithstanding the rationality of his free market policies, his government could not contain the pressures of a populist, fundamentalist sect that was venting out its frustration.

If Nassers Egypt was modernist, Sadats was anti-modernist. The same could be said of Bhutto and Ul-Haq, and elsewhere, of Allende and Pinochet. Economically they were enlightened and rational, but in other respects they were irrational, ruthless, and submissive to the worst elements of the past. Ul-Haq brought back fundamentalism, while Pinochet flirted with fascism. The return to primitiveness in these societies was more than a departure, incidentally: it was the result of the incongruities which were being shielded by those in power. 
In Sri Lanka, the political right has operated without a clear programme. The left has operated without a clear action plan. Consequently, the right has almost always been undone by its own contradictions, which explains the downfall of both the UNP of Premadasa and the SLFP of Chandrika Kumaratunga
Sri Lanka continues to witness violent shifts to authoritarianism after mild trysts with populism because of those same incongruities. The centre was always vulnerable. It was disconnected from the people because it assumed and affirmed what it thought were their aspirations. The tendency of our rulers to compare the present with a supposedly less enlightened past is, not surprisingly, a symptom of their political bankruptcy: they have nowhere else to turn to, so they end up critiquing what went by and has long gone by. I believe Dayan Jayatilleka characterised this sorry trend in our political sphere well a few months ago: 
It is necessary to avoid the cycle of international success followed by ignominy and establish a stable posture of prestige and assertive success in the world.
Dr Jayatilleka was talking about our place in the modern world, but the same can be said of our internal politics too. A cycle of promise followed by idiocy: this has been its state for so long. Logic has been defied, even trumped, in the pursuit of what the State assumes to be the best interests of the people. But without a clear blueprint for the future, be it from the left, right, or centre, no country can move forward. Not the South, not the North. And most certainly not the East. 
In Sri Lanka, the political right has operated without a clear programme. The left has operated without a clear action plan. Consequently, the right has almost always been undone by its own contradictions, which explains the downfall of both the UNP of Premadasa and the SLFP of Chandrika Kumaratunga. The left, in comparison, has been felled not for the want of a program, but for the want of the impetus needed to transform that programme into cohesive strategies. Because no left movement in this country can govern alone, it has always co-habited with the right, one way or the other. A disaster, because that has led to the empowerment of the right at the exorbitant cost of those freedoms which our Constitution guarantees for us. 
To conclude, then: in terms of policy we, or rather our leaders, have always been inconsistent. 1956 was only one of many instances in which our elite, asserting a populist line, caved into authoritarianism later on. This seemingly never-ending cycle of popular rhetoric followed by unpopular action has never really taken root in the West or in East Asia: Donald Trump has lost his lustre, while Merkel and Macron have triumphed considerably. The former won, but backed down on his own promises. The latter promised little, but what little they promised, they aim to deliver. 
And perhaps thats what we need. But as of the present, theres very little we can hope for with what we have. The talkers will continue to do what they have always done. Talk shop. The doers, who are either in the opposition or have been elbowed out of the government, will be limited to do what they have never done. Talk shop. 
We will survive, and by all accounts we may even emerge unscathed, but until then, it will be futile to hedge our bets on an individual without accounting for the fact that in this country, political rationality has always been secondary to populist irrationality. To break away from this circle requires considerable courage on our part and on the part of our elected representatives. Are we brave enough, though Only
time can tell.

One in five children in developed world in relative poverty: UN
	

REUTERS, 15th JUNE, 2017- One in five children in rich countries lives in relative poverty, according to a UNICEF report published Thursday that put the US and New Zealand among the worlds worst performers for youth well-being.
Nearly 13 percent of children in those countries lack access to sufficient safe and nutritious food, the report said, with that number rising to 20 percent in the US and Britain. Higher incomes do not automatically lead to improved outcomes for all children, and may indeed deepen inequalities, said Sarah Cook, director of the UNICEF Innocenti research office that published the study.
Governments in all countries need to take action to ensure the gaps are reduced and progress is made, she said.

Peacemaker takes brunt of scorned husband's wrath
	
An individual, who attempted to separate two bosom pals who were fighting over a woman, sustained injuries to his face and shoulder from the hand saw wielded by one of the men, who happened to be the husband of the woman in question.
Sources revealed that there were two friends who were bosom pals and lived in the Meegalawa Police division. One was married while the other was not. Both of them were so close that they even engaged in distilling illicit liquor (Kasippu) together.
Recently the married man's wife had started an affair with her husband's friend and even went to the extent of living with him. This did not go down well with the woman's husband and he had decided to take revenge on the cheating couple.
One day he had seen the pair heading toward the lake for a bath. The infuriated husband had waylaid them and had attacked them with a hand saw. Before he could reach them however a passer-by had decided to intervene in proceedings and had got between the hand saw wielding husband and the cheating couple. The unfortunate man had copped several blows to his face and shoulder and had to be hospitalised. The Galgamuwa police are conducting investigations into the incident. (Manel P Hewage)

Regressive Nationalism and the Failure of National Level Political Leadership
	
Nation-building needs a foundation of core values that could unite a diverse community of people. This cannot be done in a hurry and it requires sincere commitment to values that unite people. This is far from the reality we see at present with leaders paying lip service to grand concepts without intelligently perceiving what they stand for.
As to what change we wanted is the priceless question as the pace of change has also not been in line with what is expected of a newly mandated regime inspired by Good Governance
	The expectation is probably to see an end to regressive policy development and practices
	We need to remind the new regime we ourselves created that post-war Sri Lanka needs no lip service to grand concepts that leaders ironically cannot perceive with depth
	The country has suffered immensely due to unprincipled political leaders who have never had the backbone to stand firm on democratic values
This is although for years we have been critical of the overall system that prevailed and aspired clear-cut changes for the common good. If the change we wanted was clear enough in our minds, we wouldnt have, for instance, permitted the January 8th Regime to make a mockery of the will of the people by bringing rejected candidates through the back door. This I say as someone who respects democracy and believe in highest democratic benchmarks of governance

What is the change we wanted
As to what change we wanted is the priceless question as the pace of change has also not been in line with what is expected of a newly mandated regime inspired by Good Governance. They seldom realise that the clock ticks faster and the days are numbered for all regimes. Such sentiments have been expressed by the current leader of the opposition, Mr. R Sampanthan too as a much-respected elder statesman who obviously has national interests in mind. 

Sri Lankan democracy with an unprincipled intelligentsia
At a time when we hear many say the country needs to have more educated people in legislature and provincial bodies, the expectation is probably to see an end to regressive policy development and practices. Going by what we continue to see, the question is whether we need an intelligentsia that will appease people who are alien to democratic values and promote through ignorance and inaction, regressive forms of nationalism Today, people are reluctant to respect educated men and women who hold public office as they are considered shameless, often making grand pronouncements that they dont mean. 

Lessons for the future through mindless self-contradiction in past policy-making
People say the actions of leaders of the political left and right are unthinkable, as it is the innocent people who were at the receiving end of all things, despite lesser education in terms of formal credentials. People remember a highly celebrated leader of the so called Left Movement who made his position clear on language issues by eloquently proclaiming, Two Languages, One nation: One language, two nations. But the very same people failed regarding constitutional reforms through the First Republican Constitution of 1970, in laying the foundation for a nation of unity in diversity based on equality. 
It is a shame that such people fed more to partisan religious and linguistic nationalism, conferring special status to one religion and language over other religions and languages, while the moderates in this country wanted to see a constitution that respected the fundamental rights of all people protected in line with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, ensuring for instance, the right to worship. That is the lesson from India for us. The position was equally shameless regarding language as there were those who led this country by instigating tribal sentiments with Sinhala Only policies, indifferent to its consequences.

What we see even at this stage of unprecedented and complex socio-political issues are the apologists for the same policies, trying to justify how important it was then to restore the dignity of the Sinhala majority about their language and the religion of the majority in post-independent Sri Lanka. Hence we hear on and off, even at present, the arrogant statements against equality that we shall never do anything that will undermine the interest of the majority. 
This again will not be countered by any one so easily as this nation is not quite blessed by men of high integrity and character in leadership who can take a stand that will be respected by all people. That is the lesson we can learn from Singapore with superior thinking on these lines. Singaporeans include not only the principal minorities but also smaller groups like the Eurasian and the indigenous communities. We need to remind the new regime we ourselves created that post-war Sri Lanka needs no lip service to grand concepts that leaders ironically cannot perceive with depth but decisive changes that will at least ensure that our future will not be as bleak as the past. 

Apathy and incapacity to counter regressive nationalistic sentiments by religious groups
Is acute normlessness or anomie a condition that social institutions should deliberately promote In recent times, we have been witnessing and reading in the national newspapers, about how members of the clergy threaten and even physically intimidate their members, making a mockery of the religious order they represent. Some were intimidated verbally as well as physically and very little has been done to discipline such clergy by their own hierarchy or by the laws of the land. 

The situation is even more serious if they belong to the religion that the constitution proclaims so proudly as the state religion, as the government that habitually washes its hands off most public issues cannot be indifferent in this situation as well. The government is not carrying the obligation to ensure that the highest standards are maintained by clergy who belong to the state religion. 
These problems are seen in other religions, including my own religion. The Christian Ministry of this country with different splinter groups acting with utmost impunity have been permitted to operate without registering with the National Christian Council (NCC) and the Evangelical Alliance is a shame indeed. Without adhering to principal benchmarks stipulated, we only see greater room for regressive nationalistic forces to raise their heads and make life difficult for those who are sincere devotees, irrespective of the religion they belong to. 
There are splinter groups even among Christians who have taken the law into their own hands and prevent people from partaking of Holy Communion, as they have married members of other religions. These things happen with the total blessings of the Christian Affairs Ministry, in the way Ministries in charge of other religions remain inactive regarding standards they should maintain, at whatever cost. The Ministers in respective subjects need to be more inspiring for the public to respect them. 
The position of the state regarding the ethno-political crisis
It is unthinkable that the governments elected by the people in post-independent Sri Lanka have failed to take a clear-cut position on how they wish to provide a clear-cut solution to the ethno-political crisis that has plagued this land for decades. Thousands of lives have been lost but the minds of those who aspire to be in national leadership have not been opened. The war that was fought ended with a most questionable position taken by the leadership of the previous regime that there are only two groups of people in this land, known as the Patriots and Traitors. That those with the government irrespective of their ethnicity and other differences are Patriots and the rest are Traitors was not a position the people of this country irrespective of their status ever wanted to tolerate.

It is ironic that these leaders who were rejected by the people have not made a fair assessment of the reasons for their own downfall. Despite a feeling good peaceful environment, it is shocking that the present regime has not moved ahead convincingly in winning the confidence of the minorities on the real political problems they encounter. Empty rhetoric should be ended on all these issues urgently, with the government taking its commitment to restore good governance in all principal frontiers that remain an annoyance to the people. 

The role of the media and the academia in neutralizing regressive nationalism
Enlightened opinion formation is not easy as I have already stated in this article. What the country needs in a formidable sense is a strong foundation of nation-building in all frontiers based on democratic values. It looks like those who talk about good governance also believe such a grand project is possible within an autocratic culture too. 
The country has suffered immensely due to unprincipled political leaders who have never had the backbone to stand firm on democratic values. It is similar to the eloquently proclaimed need for two languages for one nation ending up with the extraordinary position of advocating one religion over other religions. 
The media as well as the academia in a developing country have a very special role to play in creating an enlightened public, as many remain unenlightened on core principles of democracy. The freedom that we have today in the aftermath of defeating an oppressive regime that believed in abducting and killing anyone with dissenting views should be used more responsibly. Those freedoms will not be ours very soon, if we, as a nation prove once again that we are not prepared to learn lessons from the past. It is time that the broad-based national mass media institutions take their role more seriously, instead of conferring status to what could set our beautiful country alight once again. 
Academics are aware of the type of culture required for a university to prosper. However that too becomes an issue as they have not been sources of inspiration to the overall student population in maintaining a healthy dialogue with them on issues of grave national concern. Students take to the streets due to their indifference. In the absence of a culture that is politically more liberal in orientation, what we see is the scope for those with contradictory positions to occupy the space for vibrant discussion and debate devoid of confrontational tactics that burden the less fortunate of the land.

Russia's Defense Ministry says it is investigating reports that ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi was killed in one of its airstrikes in Syria last month, the CNN reported a short while ago.
The airstrike on May 28 was carried out on the outskirts of the militant group's de facto capital Raqqa, on a command post where ISIS leaders were meeting, the article said quoting Russian state media reports.
"According to information, which is being verified via different channels, the meeting was also attended by the (ISIS) leader Ibrahim Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, who was eliminated in the strike," the ministry said, according to the TASS report in English.
Other state media reported that more than 300 "terrorists" were killed in the strike. An image grab taken from a propaganda video released on July 5, 2014 of ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi in Mosul.
The leaders were discussing their exit from the city through the so-called southern corridor, the ministry said.
The airstrike was carried out following drone footage confirmation of the council's meeting location, state-run Sputnik reports.
US defense officials say they were unable to confirm the reports. Col. Ryan Dillon, a spokesman for the US-led coalition's operation against ISIS in Syria and Iraq, said the coalition "cannot confirm these reports at this time."
There have been multiple reports of Baghdadi's death in the past that have turned out to be false, CNN said.

He said the facilities provided by the semi-luxury buses were not in satisfactory when compared with the bus fares and most of them were overcrowded.
It is similar on highway routes. We have authorised the highway traffic police to enforce the law against the bus owners, Mr. Hemachandra said.

Review of Ratata Uvamana Vama by Wimal Weerawansa
With several thought-provoking publications already to his credit, Weerawansa ranks among the rare exceptions of the recent past
	What Weerawansa has done is a series of impressionist sweeps begins with a brief introduction to Imperialism
	Weerawansa proceeds to furnish glimpses of the revolutionary socialist experiences of the Soviet Union, China and Cuba
	He reiterates his ardent commitment to a socialist path of development which is based, not upon any doctrinal ism or dogma, but on the social-welfare paradigms
At a research conference on contemporary political affairs of South Asia conducted in Delhi some years ago, an elderly scholar of global repute said: In independent Indias first parliament, there were forty-two authors of important writings but my friends (stage-whisper following a theatrical pause) in the present Lok Sabha, it would be difficult to find forty-two who have read a book.
This hyperbolic show of cynical contempt came to mind when, a few days ago, I received a copy of Wimal Weerawansas recently published Sinhalese monograph because, barring the occasional newspaper commentary on current affairs, there has only been a barely perceptible scattering of books authored by those in parliamentary politics over the 70-year spell of independent Sri Lanka. Works comparable in content and intent to, say, D.S. Senanayakes Agriculture and Patriotism, S.W.R.D. Bandaranaikes Spinning Wheel and the Paddy Field, Wilmot A. Pereras Problems of Rural Ceylonor S.A. Wickremasinghes Path Ahead, have remained a distant memory. Thus, with several thought-provoking publications already to his credit, Weerawansa ranks among the rare exceptions of the recent past. 
It is the glowing tribute in the Foreword by our illustrious writer Gunadasa Amarasekara that has served as the impulse for me to begin reading Ratata Uvamana Vamawithout delay instead of depositing it among my souvenirs. That turned out to be an absorbing experience on the basis of which I have no hesitation in stating that Weerawansas book is featured by a level of clarity of thought, scholarly erudition and potential impact seldom seen in Sinhala writings of this type of non-fiction works including those that have come my way in the form of manuscripts for review and post-graduate dissertations for evaluation. It is this fact that impels me to write the present review. My objective is to introduce to our bilingual readership a work vitally relevant to an understanding of the deepening crisis of governance which, in the absence of a genuine coalescence of socialist and nationalist forces, will imperil the very survival of Sri Lanka. 
At the outset of his discourse, Weerawansa indicates where he stands in our spectrum of political ideology by reiterating his ardent commitment to a socialist path of development which is based, not upon any doctrinal ism or dogma, but on the social-welfare paradigms of the indigenous civilisation of Sri Lanka maintained over several millennia until its contamination by European colonial intrusions of late-medieval times. According to Weerawansa (to continue my paraphrase in highly condensed form), while the Old Left lost its way in its rigid adherence to one or another interpretation of Marxism and eventually became an appendage of neo-liberal ideology propagated by the global superpowers, the JVP which acquired a dominant position in Sri Lankas Left during the recent decades has opted for a show of conducting a fierceanti-corruption struggle in preference to the traditional anti-imperialist struggle prescribed in Marxist theory, has also ended up entangled in the same camp as the Colombo-based NGO mafia lucratively serving the interests of the major Western powers while maintaining a faade of radicalism and impartiality by performing, in day-to-day local politics, a supposedly constructive role dealing mainly with ephemeral issues. 
In a short review conforming to the usual newspaper length-specifications, it is not possible to provide a summary of the contents of this tightly packed volume. What Weerawansa has done in a series of impressionist sweeps begins with a brief introduction to Imperialism and the origin of modern Nation-States in which he has captured in essence the scramble among imperial powers, then and now, for subjugating Sri Lanka mainly for the immeasurable value of the island as a prime locational resource. Of special interest in this section of the monograph is the analysis of how this scramble resonates at present in the geopolitical interactions of the NATO super-powers and the Asian regional powers, the predatory interests especially of the former and of Modis India being camouflaged by bogus humanitarian concerns. Thereafter, Weerawansa proceeds to furnish glimpses of the revolutionary socialist experiences of the Soviet Union, China and Cuba, highlighting their achievements and failures (in the case of the USSR, its collapse) with references mainly to the contrasting durability of their civilisational paradigms of governance. 
In my assessment, Weerawansas vivid portrayal of the harmony between the social-welfare paradigms of Theravada Buddhist teachings and the principles of equity and distributive justice inherent in socialism is one of the most appealing sections of this volume
It is in the next four chapters of his book that the author comes to grips with the thematic essence of his discourse. Commencing with a critique of the Left as represented by the JVP in Sri Lankas mainstream politics, he has proceeded to forcefully argue that its present leadership, in its preoccupation with the pursuit of short-term personal gain, has lost the capacity to grasp the nature of the prevailing threats to our nation, not realising that the role it has opted to perform has the effect of reinforcing such threats. What I see in this section of the discourse is a reasoned appeal for course-correction, rather than a confrontational condemnation<U+0336> a plea addressed to the Left <U+0336> in which the author has highlighted:(a) the diverse forms of insidious external support received by the LTTE in its secessionist campaign, (b) the sustained human rights onslaught against Sri Lanka after the demise of the battle-field leadership of the LTTE, (c) the continuing neo-liberal hostility towards the Sangha and its role in our arena of politics and (d) the ongoing attempts to denigrate the normative social-welfare paradigms of Buddhism as practiced down the ages in Sri Lanka.

In my assessment, Weerawansas vivid portrayal of the harmony between the social-welfare paradigms of Theravada Buddhist teachings and the principles of equity and distributive justice inherent in socialism is one of the most appealing sections of this volume. Sri Lankan experiences demonstrate with clarity that deviations from our civilisational value framework under exogenous compulsions-ideological and material-have generated intense social unrest and instability in our country, similar to those witnessed in a series of Nation States of North Africa and the Middle East targeted by the duplicitous NATO efforts supposedly to make the world safe for democracy. The mass of empirical evidence presented in support of this assertion is, indeed, a cause of amazement when looked at in the context of the emotional and physical hardships of incarceration and political persecution suffered by the author during the writing of his discourse. It is also seen that his submissions constitute, in effect, an elucidation of Amarasekeras Subhyathva Rajyaya Kara (Towards a Civilizational State), published last year, which pioneered the idea that the Sri Lankan welfare state is a derivative of the intrinsic civilisational paradigms nurtured down the ages in our country, rather than a colonial implantation shaped by the utilitarian principle of the greatest happiness of the greatest number. 
It is for the purpose of substantiating the assertion of an absence of discordance between Marxist and Buddhist socio-political thought that Weerawansa has engaged in a relatively long presentation of comparative perspectives on a range of issues such as the nature of primitive man; origins of human social organisation; emergence of private property rights over sources of livelihood and its adverse social impact (crime, vice, violence avariciousness etc.); individualism and communitarianism; the evolution of government; and the curtailment of crime. Based as it is onboth extracts from a selection of early Buddhist texts and a few related commentaries of more recent times, as well as from some Marxist theoretical writings, I do not have the competence essential for an evaluation of this discussion from an academic perspective, especially a familiarity with the Buddhist texts referred to. But what I do see in it is both the ability of the author to communicate his thoughts with clarity, alongside a strengthening of his effort to convince those inclined towards our political Left that their aims and aspirations will not be placed in jeopardy if they were to enter a viable and dynamic partnership with our nationalist forces in a concerted effort to lead the country towards the ideals of the Civilisational State. 
The concluding segment of this volume provides additional insights on the obstacles that are in the way of infusing the ideals of the Civilisational State to governance in our country mainly in the form of both ideological and economic counter-pressures as well as the highly portent processes of acculturation to which Sri Lanka is constantly exposed. 
It is not surprising that this extraordinarily invaluable discourse is not entirely devoid of deficiencies. These I attribute to the constraints of imprisonment and a rush to publish-the latter probably driven by the looming political disasters in the form of misguided constitutional reforms and the wayward and short-sighted external relations.
For instance, the evidence pertaining to the accent on social welfare in Sri Lankas pre-modern governance could have been substantially enlarged and editorially rearranged for more forceful effect. More significant as a blemish in my view is that, unlike in Amarasekeras treatise on the Civilisational State (acknowledged by Weerawansa as a source of inspiration for his thinking), there is an absence in this discourse of an evidential substantiation of the view that the ideal of the Civilisational State in Sri Lanka does not entail an infringement of the rights of those belonging toother religious faiths in our country. As categorically stated in Subhyathva Rajyaya Kara, the pursuit of the Civilisational State ideal does not involve either a devaluation of the contribution of religious minorities to the civilization of our country, or the abandonment of the hallmarks of inclusivism and tolerance of Buddhism as practiced (except by criminal elements) in this country, or a subordination of minority rights. This is a line of reasoning on which, I think, Weerawansas appeal to the Left, especially in the context of his socialist-nationalist mindset (mage vama-jathikavadi manasa) should have been elaborated.
Hopefully, that will be done in a revised and enlarge edition of his present discourse or as an aspect dealt with in his forthcoming volume, Yadmin Bndi Akshara.

Trump decries obstruction probe related to phony Russia story
	

By John Wagner 
President Donald Trump took to Twitter on Thursday to offer his first comments on news that he is being examined for possible obstruction of justice - an investigation he dismissed as part of the phony accusations of collusion between his campaign and Russia last year. 
They made up a phony collusion with the Russians story, found zero proof, so now they go for obstruction of justice on the phony story, Trump said in a tweet shortly before 7 a.m. 
Nice, he added. 
An hour later, Trump fired off another tweet, saying: You are witnessing the single greatest WITCH HUNT in American political history - led by some very bad and conflicted people! 
He did not name the bad and conflicted people. 
The Washington Post reported Wednesday that the special counsel overseeing the investigation into Russias role in the 2016 election is interviewing senior intelligence officials as part of a widening probe that now includes an examination of whether Trump attempted to obstruct justice, according to officials. 
The move by special counsel Robert S. Mueller III to investigate Trumps conduct marks a major turning point in the nearly year-old FBI investigation, which until recently focused on Russian meddling during the presidential campaign and on whether there was any co-ordination between the Trump campaign and the Kremlin. 
The White House has recently made a practice of referring questions related to the investigation to Trumps personal lawyer, and aides and associates have urged the president to refrain from commenting on the case on Twitter.

Under new Constitution: 'Caste based reservations sought in Jaffna'
	
Caste based reservations in governing bodies and educational institutions have been sought by some political parties, organizations and individuals in Jaffna in their submissions to the Pubic Representation Committee on Constitutional Reforms, officials said yesterday.
Committee Chairman Lal Wijenayake told the Daily Mirror that the north was the sole area where this problem was openly discussed when deliberating the general public on constitutional reforms.
Mr.Wijenayake said the EPRLF led by former North-East Provincial Council Chief Minister Varatharajah Perumal was one political party that sough such reservation citing that caste based discrimination was so acute.
This is the only area where they came openly about the caste problem. They said there was discrimination. They even said the depressed castes accounted for 40 per cent. I do not know. I am not sure about the number. I asked why they did not fight back if the number were so high. They were concerned that there was no representation for them in the elected bodies and the education sector. They said they did not receive any representation after 1960 for the caste group considered to be lowest, he said.
In making submission, he said it was referred to how an MP was appointed during the time of former Prime Minister the late Sirimawo Bandaranaike.
They said the political parties were dominated by the higher caste groups today. It is difficult to get nominations from these parties. They wanted allocation of seats, he said.
He said even medical specialists came before the Committee and complained about discrimination over the caste factor.
Even some members of our committee were very angry when such complaints were made. Some of our committee members noted it as exaggeration, he said. (Kelum Bandara)
