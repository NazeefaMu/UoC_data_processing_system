FIU request: SL shares more info on Rajapaksa deals
	
Sri Lanka has shared more information with India on the billions of dollars that its new government alleges members of the previous regime headed by Mahinda Rajapaksa had stashed abroad, to support the island nation's request for New Delhi's help to set up a Financial Intelligence Unit to trace the money.
During his India trip earlier this week, new Sri Lankan President Maithripala Sirisena told the Indian leadership about accounts in tax havens such as the St Martin Islands, Hong Kong, Macau and Seychelles where he claimed much of the money had been moved to, government officials privy to the discussions told ET. Sirisena also informed Prime Minister Narendra Modi and other Indian leaders about investments that were allegedly made by the Rajapaksa family in real-estate projects in Dubai, Uganda and Kenya, the officials said.
Sirisena indicated that his government was very serious about pursuing corruption charges against the former president and that it has set up a commission to investigate the charges. As per diplomatic sources, Lankan Foreign Minister Mangala Samaraweera also sought US help in unearthing the money, during his trip there on February 11-15.
Sirisena and the coalition of parties led by him had made corruption a key issue in their successful January election campaign and are moving quickly to fulfil promises.
According to them, powerful figures in the previous government had stashed away $5 billion. The Lankan Cabinet has appointed a high-powered "rapid response team" to look into allegations of corruption in land transactions, stock market price-fixing and abuse of state funds for political purposes. Rajapaksa hasn't yet commented on the allegations.
Officials also pointed out that the meeting between Sirisena and Modi was extremely cordial, which was in stark contrast to interactions with Rajapaksa. New Delhi had been wary about Colombo's close ties under Rajapaksa with Beijing. Sirisena has apparently indicated willingness to correct the China tilt, officials said.
"Rajapaksa, ignoring India's security concerns, continued to deepen defence cooperation with the Chinese government and was even willing to elevate Sino-Sri Lanka relations to a strategic cooperation," an Indian official said. (The Economic Times)

Rs.1.177 bn spent on CHOGM publicity
	
The Mass Media and Information Ministry has spent as much as Rs.1.177 billion for the publicity and media coverage of the Commonwealth Head of Government Meeting (CHOGM) conducted in Colombo in 2013, Parliament was informed yesterday.
Media Minister Gayantha Karunatilake placed these details before the House in response to a question raised by JVP leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake.
The minister said these monies had been spent from treasury grants and he too could not fathom as to why such a colossal amount of money was spent for media related activities by the previous government.
Rs.828 million had been spent for the construction and maintenance of the media centre. Rs.180 million had been spent for publicity programmes in the electronic media, Rs. 144 million for public awareness programmes, Rs. 4 million for the purchase of office equipment, Rs. 396, 696 for the creation of the official logo and newspaper advertisements, Rs. 10 million for the entertainment of local and foreign journalists including the provision of dinner for them.
Raising a supplementary question, Mr. Dissanayake said it was amazing that as much as Rs.10 million had been spent for the entertainment of journalists.
"I was taken aback to hear it. These details have surfaced because of the election of a new government. Otherwise, these details would have been concealed or suppressed," he said.
The Minister, who is also the Chief Government Whip, said he too could not believe it.
"Let?s hope we will not hear such waste of public funds in the future. There are no bills to support some expenses," he said.(Kelum Bandara and Yohan Perera)
