A gaffe and then off the cuff
	

Our country had the occasion to host a very important international conference in Colombo recently.
A senior purohita hailing from the central hills too was billed to deliver an address at the inaugural session of this conference and thanks to a good copy done by his aides, he delivered an impressive speech when his turn came to take the floor.

The conference was over, Number One in yahapalanaya hosted the foreign delegates to a dinner at his official residence. The senior purohita who addressed the inaugural sessions himself had to deliver the welcome speech on the occasion. And he got up ready to speak from a prepared script as he did in the morning.
Good Morning, Ladies and Gentlemen, the senior purohita started off. The dinner guests made furtive quizzical glances at one another. And the senior purohita was holding forth regardless.
However, he soon realized that he was waxing eloquent from the script he used in the morning and for a moment looked flustered but quickly recovered himself and resumed speaking off the cuff.
Number One and all dinner guests who could not help looking highly amused, however, greeted his speech with loud applause.

All set for pole-vaulters Week
	

The second week of January 2018 has already been named as Pole-vaulters Week, they say. 

The reason is quite obvious: there are several Diyawanna members all agog to set their political journey in a new direction. Even the successful soothsayer Harrison from Rajarata too had said that the second week in January will witness a number of political pole-vaults.
Those keen on identifying the would-be-pole-vaulters are advised to pay more attention to the ones maintaining an unusual silence these days than those who are making noises.
Most seeking new pastures could be the ones due to follow the precedent set by the guy from Negombo. By the way, some of them at the eleventh hour may even positively consider the open invitation from the Green party, they say.

## Title: Anoja Between the one and the other

Anoja Between the one and the other
	
Keli Madala, D. B. Nihalsinghes fourth film, was arguably also his weakest. It teeters between anger and hope, between idealism and cynicism, rather unstably, and it concentrates that conflict of opposites within the terse, tragic love story between the politician and his teenage paramour. The two most memorable sequences depict the shift from reconciliation to malice in that story: the first of them has them meet, for the last time, by a river, declaring their affections for each other no matter what; the second has the politician, now hardened, in a close up that reveals his blind hatred towards her.
The latter is followed by an arbitrary, less than satisfying, and predictable ending: the woman is gunned down at her doorstep, at his orders. Keli Madala has none of the fluidity, the unhurried pacing, that Maldeniye Simion and Ridi Nimnaya and Welikathara had, partly because of its vignette-like narrative (at one point you feel that the script barely parses, that the plot never properly coheres), but thankfully it is salvaged for the most by its acting. As the politician, then, H. A. Perera proved his versatility in the cinema, and as his paramour, so did Anoja Weerasinghe.
Back then, I didnt really know what film acting entailed. This bothered me particularly in when I had to give into my repressed feelings after shooting and killing Ravindra Randeniyas and Malini Fonsekas characters
Less sophisticated
I have seen Anoja Weerasinghe in a great many films and from them four stick to my memory the most, for her ability to salvage the story that way: Keli Madala, Siri Medura, Janelaya, Seilama. (I have unfortunately not seen Maldeniye Simion.) The features of hers that entice one  that rough, unapologetic voice; those bulging, expressive eyes; that sensual, defiant figure  crop up in film after film, and for better or worse, thats what has cut her out as a different actress. In this sense I think her biggest strength has been her ability to embody contradictory feelings, sometimes in the same sequence, a quality to be met very rarely among both her contemporaries.
After smiling and talking with the boy for the first time in Janelaya, for instance, she turns around and faces the antagonist (her mute accomplice, played by Ravindra Randeniya): the smile is gone, and so is her radiance. Its the same story in Keli Madala, where at one moment shes exchanging pleasantries with her lover, and the very next shes berating him for his callousness; where at one moment she is listening to his sympathetic daughters (Nilmini Tennakoon) suggestion that she join an organisation for hard-done-by women, and the very next shes scorning that daughters shows of sympathy to the father, her paramour, himself.
In the seventies and eighties, right after Malini Fonseka claimed the right to be the queen of the local cinema, a horde of actresses destined to repudiate the populist, patriarchal base which Malinis characters inadvertently stood for entered the industry. They came in a particular order, and Anoja, chronologically, was the third among them. The other two, Nadeeka Gunasekara and Swarna Mallawarachchi, came earlier (though while Swarna entered the industry long before her, her second phase, in which she played the defiant woman, commenced after Anojas first forays). The differences between these three couldnt have been more apparent: Nadeeka was almost always the timid, introspective rebel, while Swarna, even at her most defiant, was urbane, calm, contained, controlled. With Anoja you come across a player who fit into neither category and yet was somehow at home with both: less urbane, less sophisticated, and by default less contained. She expresses her rage in gushes and torrents; at her most expressive, she virtually oozes out that rage, and wins us over.
The transition
If she appears to be almost never contained in these films its because that attitude, of being unforgivable and ruthless, make her embody the same predatory characteristics of the societies she is rebelling against. The transition in her from a naive, simple girl to a strong, defiant fighter was, I think, reflected in a childhood spent oscillating between the village and the metropolis. In Siri Medura, Keli Madala, and Seilama, her characters oscillate in that sense between these two opposite worlds, while in the first of those films she occupies a walawwa that is at home with neither the one nor the other. Its an almost shell-shocked, schizophrenic house that she inhabits, that is bound to drive her against the established order. She rarely does fight back overtly, of course, but in Siri Medura she does, though her act of gunning down two people is followed, not by the exhilaration of release, but by a series of ambivalent hysterics. Fittingly, the film ends with her running away from the manor (where to, though).
So what of her childhood Anoja Weerasinghe was born in Kailagoda, in the Badulla district. She never received any formal training in her field, but she had an intimate bond with the temple and her parents, the latter of whom were very artistically inclined. She attended schools in both Badulla and Moneragala, in which she took part in concerts and plays. The first of those plays, staged when she was five or six, had her play out a Japanese princess, while her first performance came about when she was 13.
Malinis influence
She discovered the theatre in the village, the movies in the city. At a time when going to the cinema was considered a ritual, Anoja and her friends would walk four miles patiently every time (because there werent any buses after 6.30 in the evening) to watch the latest shows. One of the movies that struck her, at once, was Welikathara: because many theatres couldnt accommodate the CinemaScope format, they were forced to show it through the conventional projector and screen, distorting the image in the process.
But that sense of daring, and the experience stamped on the film, exceeded its technical interest, so for a long time it entranced young Anoja. Resolved on entering the industry, she hence watched as many movies as she could, almost all of which, she remembered, had Malini Fonseka. Malini became a guide of sorts for her, and in her own words, I would imitate her for days on end. Eventually she landed in the industry with a 30-second appearance in Yasapalitha Nanayakkaras Tak Tik Tuk, released one year after her first performance, in Monarathenna (also directed by Nanayakkara), opposite Malini, Vijaya Kumaratunga, and Rukmani Devi.
There were other roles, of course; opposite Swarna Mallawarachchi in Sinhabahu (Pathiraja S. Dayananda), opposite Malini in Aradhana (Vijaya Dharma Sri), opposite Sanath Gunathilake in Kaliyugaya (Lester James Peries), and opposite Swarna again in Muhudu Lihini (Sunil Ariyaratne). Muhudu Lihini was shot by D. B. Nihalsinghe, who saw her and was impressed enough by her performance to take her aboard Maldeniye Simion.
But when her name was suggested by Nihalsinghe for one of the leading female characters, both Arawwala Nandimithra (who wrote the original novel) and the producers tried to back out. But the director held firm: if he couldnt cast her, he wouldnt direct the film. So they relented, and so she was in. Remembering Nihalsinghe for me, she had this to say: I was like a ball of clay under him. He moulded me. To this day I cant understand how I played for him in Simion and Keli Madala. Hes so soft-spoken that when he instructs me, the actor beside me cant hear him. In a very subtle manner, he drew the character I played into my soul.
Its interesting to note here that her first few performances had her as a rural woman, right down from Monarathenna. This was despite her adulation of Malini, who gradually in the seventies (the decade in which Anoja bloomed and matured) moved from the village to the city (barring the occasional film). Its interesting also to note that Swarnas first few performances, in the eighties and even before, had her depict more urbane women (think of Yahalu Yeheli, Ridi Nimnaya, Biththi Hathara, and Hansa Vilak) and this despite her past adulation of Punya Heendeniya, who was anything but urbane (barring her portrayals in Ran Salu and Kaliyugaya, where she nevertheless wasnt completely cut off from the rural). In both cases it was, all in all, a subtle inversion of the mentors who had figured in their careers, and with that I think you can discern the difference between Anoja and Swarna: the one was destined to suffer, to be expressive about her rage, while the other, also destined to suffer, was doomed at the same time to suffer more for expressing that rage. When Anoja fights back (in Keli Madala, for instance), her death is planned and executed rather abruptly: her deterioration is never extended, never unbearably dragged on, while in Swarnas case (Dadayama, Suddilage Kathawa, Ayoma), it usually is. The one is shut out and done away with at once, usually; the other is shut out only at the very end.
These were formative years, of course, since she hadnt completely let go of her theatrical past. In Monarathenna she found it difficult to get used to the subtle nuances the cinema was capable of, while in Maldeniye Simion and Keli Madala she was, as with Siri Medura, overtly expressive but more in command of her characters. I particularly remember the last sequence in the latter film, in which she gives into an onslaught of hysterics which, she informed me, came out rather spontaneously.
Back then, I didnt really know what film acting entailed. This bothered me particularly in when I had to give into my repressed feelings after shooting and killing Ravindra Randeniyas and Malini Fonsekas characters. This involved a lot of footage, which necessitated a series of rehearsals and a perfect final take. When Parakrama aiya asked me to do a rehearsal, however, I was lost.
How could I act out when there was nothing in my mind I told Parakrama aiya to go for the take, hoping that something would come out. What happened next I dont really know, but when the camera started rolling, I began asserting my natural self. This led in turn to a barrage of hysterics which continued until the very last shot. That first take was taken in. Right there.

At least 48 dead when bus plunges onto rocky beach in Peru
	

HINDUSTAN TIMES, 03rd JANUARY, 2018 - At least 48 people died when a bus tumbled down a cliff onto a rocky beach Tuesday along a narrow stretch of highway known as the Devils Curve, Peruvian police and fire officials said.
The bus carrying 57 people was headed to Perus capital when it was struck by a tractor trailer shortly before noon and plunged down the slope, said Claudia Espinoza with Perus voluntary firefighter brigade. The blue bus came to rest upside down on a strip of shore next to the Pacific, the lifeless bodies of passengers strewn among the rocks.
Its very sad for us as a country to suffer an accident of this magnitude, Peruvian President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski said in a statement.
Rescuers had to struggle to rescue survivors and recover the dead from the hard-to-reach area in Pasamayo, about 70 kilometres (43 miles) north of Lima.

CH - Navy brawl - Dhanushka Perera writes
	
In response to our article titled CH shocked over Yoshitha criticism Mr. Dhanushka Perera has sent the following letter in which he states as follows. 
This is to bring to you notice that I was shocked and dismayed to see the way my name has been dragged into and unnecessarily mentioned repeatedly regarding the incident that happened at the rugby match between CH & FC and Navy SC on December 30, 2017.
I was not even present at the place of the altercation that happened between some of the players from the CH & FC Rugby Team and a few Navy SC players as shown by media reports regarding a video.
As soon as we won the match I was cheering our victory and at that moment the CH & FC Rugby Manager from the bench started yelling and came towards me at the ground yelling in disrespectful language.
It is understood that he could not come to terms with the defeat of his team but a manager should not enter the ground and yell at an opposition player which is a known fact. When he yelled at me all that I told him was that he cannot enter the ground and speak in such a language and to go back to the bench, and I simply walked away.
This is what exactly happened and nothing more as I see that he has concocted another story to put the blame on the Navy SC players.
During a rugby match heated language between players is a normal thing. However, this is not the place for rugby team managers to speak to players in the opposition side in such an ungracious manner.
Regarding the article written by Harsha Amarasinghe in the News Paper making accusation at me I would like to clarify the following:
Many Clubs gave me offers more than
CH & FC, however, I was offered the Rugby Captaincy at Navy SC and the Navy SC has always been like a home to me as they treat their players as family, I made a personal decision to stay with the Navy SC Rugby Team. Loyalty cannot be bought by money and I have great respect towards the Navy SC. This has nothing to do with financial benefits as mentioned by this reporter. As a media personality shouldnt it be the responsibility of a member of such a reputed newspaper to first talk to both sides and write the truth instead of tarnishing a persons character. It is irresponsible to state such claim that has no backing or value.
Regarding the claims that I supported CH & FC by sending Navy SC Rugby Players has no standing. Being a captain and having played for the team for many years, it is not in my values and principles to do such things to a team that I am loyal to. If the CH & FC Team won the match on that day, none of this false media reports would have emerged regarding me and my team. All of these false media accusations blaming me and the team are simply because we won the match against CH & FC.
Even with a new team, with few senior players we have managed to still play the game with great pride. Being a Captain its not about me, its about the people that are in my team and how I can help them to be successful. Thats all I have done this season with the talented players we have in our Navy family. I will not accept such claims and accusations made by the CH & FC blaming me regarding this incident. The video shows exactly what happen and I cannot take the blame for such incidents. I have great respect for all the rugby players and we all are friends at the end of the day. There are no personal grudges against anyone and it is sad to see that outsiders to the incident have ensured that it has fallen to this unhealthy level of sportsmanship between players.

Chinese company has no authority to hoist Chinese flag: Gammanpila
	
Pivithuru Hela Urumaya (PHU) yesterday claimed that the Chinese Company which was handling the Hambantota Port Project did not have the authority to hoist the Chinese flag within Sri Lankan territory.
It was reported that the Chinese flag and the Sri Lankan flag were hoisted in the Hambantota Port premises on January 1 with both flags at the same level though it had been the custom to hoist the Sri Lankan flag at a higher level than the other flags.
PHU General Secretary and MP Udaya Gammanpila told a news conference that only the Chinese Embassy had the authority to hoist the Chinese flag in Sri Lanka and at events at which the Chinese leader was participating.
Hoisting a flag belonging to a certain country at a certain place depicts its authority over that land. The Chinese Company has no right to hoist the Chinese flag. They are also governed by the Sri Lankan law and they should abide by it, he said.
The MP said the flag-hoisting incident raised doubts as to whether the Hambantota Port belonged to China and it was questionable whether there were more agreements which were not revealed with this regard. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)

Number One in Yahapalanaya recently attended a party meeting organized by a prominent purohita on behalf of the Party candidates in the running for the upcoming local polls.

Whenever Number One attends a party function in some area, it is the partys local leaders who would welcome him first. However, at this particular function, in a sharp departure from the usual practice, it was the latest defector from the Panchayudha party who had come forward to do the honours. The purohita had made this arrangement as a slap on the face of Price Panchaudha who is embroiled in a protracted feud with the Kaduwela ex-mayor.
However, Kaduwela local politico did not take kindly to this well-meant gesture which deprived him of the honour of welcoming the big man visiting his stronghold.
The disgruntled politico had kicked up a big row over this slight done to him, but he had been careful enough to stage the act to give vent to his hurt feelings behind the stage!

13 Indian fishermen arrested; two trawlers seized
	
Thirteen Indian fishermen had been arrested by the Sri Lankan Navy for engaging in illegal fishing in the Sri Lankan territorial waters in the seas off Kachchathivu Island this morning, Navy Media Spokesman Commander Dinesh Bandara said today.
He said that a Fast Attack Craft attached to the Northern Naval Command arrested the fishermen along with two trawlers.
The fishermen were handed over to the Assistant Fisheries Director of Jaffna for legal action.
Meanwhile, Indian media alleged that the Sri Lankan Navy personnel had damaged a few more boats and fishing gear belonging to the flotilla of Indian fishermen using iron rods, before chasing them away.
The Indian media cited Indian Assistant Director of Fisheries A. Manikandan as saying that more than 2,000 fishermen from Thangachimadam had ventured into the sea on Wednesday in 523 boats and were fishing near Kachchathivu, when the Sri Lankan Naval men came to the spot and arrested the 13 fishermen.
They also snapped the fishing nets of 50 boats and damaged some boats using iron rods, he was quoted as saying. (Chaturanga Pradeep)

Killing of 5 youth in Trinco: Case now progressing with Skype evidence
	
Law and Order Minister Sagala Ratnayaka said today the case involving the 2006 killing of five Tamil students in Trincomalee was now progressing as new reforms have allowed the use of Skype evidence.
In a tweet, Minister Ratnayaka said, We could not proceed with the case as the main witness was overseas and was not in a position to support proceedings. The case is now progressing as new reforms have allowed the use of Skype evidence.
The Minister made this revelation in response to a tweet by US Ambassador Atul Keshap. Referring to the delay in the case, the US Ambassador said justice delayed is justice denied.
In a statement, Minister Ratnayakes Media Unit said the five Tamil students were killed on January 2, 2006 in Trincomalee allegedly by a group of Police Special Task Force officers.
Twelve STF officers were later arrested by the Police in connection with the killings.
Dr. Kasipillai Manoharan, the father of one of the five students, attended the UN Human Rights Council annual review meeting in March 2013 to demand justice for the murders.
Dr. Manoharan, in his speech said, My son Rajigar was one of the five university students assassinated in Trincomalee. On behalf of the five students I am seeking justice. Seven years have elapsed after the brutal killings of the students, but so far justice was not served,
In Sri Lanka, however, the authorities found it hard to proceed with the case for a long time as Dr. Manoharan, a key witness in the case, was overseas and was not in a position to support proceedings.

Majority of French now favour allowing surrogate motherhood
	

REUTERS, 03rd JANUARY, 2018 - A majority of French people would favour allowing surrogate motherhood, though primarily only for medical reasons, a poll showed on Wednesday, highlighting a shift in attitudes as France prepares to review laws relating to assisted reproduction.
All forms of surrogacy, where a woman gives birth to a child on behalf of someone else, are banned in France, as in several other European countries such as Germany. Some countries like the United Kingdom allow for altruistic surrogacies, not commercial ones.
The French government will launch a debate on a new bioethics legislative pact this year, which could see medically assisted reproduction extended to female gay couples and single women, a stance favoured by President Emmanuel Macron.
He opposes introducing surrogate motherhood, however.
Until recently public opinion was also against surrogacy, but the poll by Ifop, published in La Croix, a Catholic newspaper, found that 62 percent of French people were now in favour of it.
Of those, 46 percent would only back surrogate motherhood if there were medical reasons to do so, while 18 percent said they supported it in all circumstances.

There is a deputy purohita well-known as the political power behind the issuance of many permits for mining and transporting sand. Of course, the politico is keeping himself out of the scene as he has a family member as the front man for directly dealing with the permit seekers.

With local polls in the offing, the politico has become more liberal in obliging the permit seekers. Political activists, particularly hawk-eyed these days have got wise to the secret role being played by the deputy and the Green and Red heavyweights are said to be now getting ready to expose the racket with a big bang, they say.

PM referred COPE report on bond issue to AG in 2016
	
In the wake of President Maithripala Sirisenas statement on the fraud involving the bond issue, the Prime Ministers office said today that even Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe requested the Attorney General in December, 2016 to make recommendations on legal action against those officials responsible for the controversial bond transaction.
The statement said the Prime Minister referred the COPEfindings on the bond issue to the Attorney General on October 31, 2016.
The statement said, the Attorney General had been assigned with the responsibility to institute legal action on the bond transaction by the Prime Minister in December, 2016 and by the President in January, 2018. The Yahapalana government has been able to establish its law-abiding characteristic once again. It is expected that the Attorney General will initiate action.
The Prime Ministers Office said the government expected to probe the alleged frauds and irregularities that happened since 2008.
The Office said it was the duty of all to let the law prevail in this regard instead of resorting to mudslinging and character assassination.
The Prime Ministers Office also thanked the Bond Commission for the fulfillment of its task.

President must also be held responsible: JO
	
In the wake of President Maithripala Sirisenas statement on the Central Bank bond scam, the joint opposition today said President Sirisena should also be held responsible for the fraud as he was the appointing authority of Arjuna Mahendran as the Central Bank Governor who cleaned out the Treasury.
Addressing a news conference on behalf of the joint opposition, former minister Prof. G.L. Peiris said President Sirisena had only appointed Mr. Mahendran. He also said yesterdays President Sirisenas statement was merely to distance himself from the fraud which had caused a whopping loss of Rs. 11 billion to the state.
Though President Sirisena vowed to recover money through legal means as Mr. Mahendran being a Singaporean would have spirited away the stolen money. Therefore, it is practically difficult to prosecute him. Even if he is prosecuted, the extradition law has to be applied which is a long and complicated process, he added.
He said the second bond scam had taken place after the Parliament was dissolved and added that it could have been prevented if President Sirisena had not dissolved the Parliament allowing the the Parliamentary Committee on Public Enterprises (COPE) headed by former Minister D.E.W. Gunasekera to proceed with the investigations.
While referring to the statement by President Sirisena that the Bond Commission is of the opinion that similar incidents as revealed in the Commission Report had happened even in 2008, he said it was completely outside the scope of the commission to consider about it and urged the authorities not to distract the attention of the people.

Singapore bans film on indicted Palestinian teen activist
	

REUTERS, 03rd JANUARY, 2018- Singapore has banned a film festival from screening a documentary later this week that features a teenage Palestinian female activist whose arrest last month has made her a symbol of resistance to Israeli military occupation in the West Bank.
Justifying the ban, authorities in the Southeast Asian city state said the film Radiance of Resistance was skewed and potentially divisive for Singapores multi-ethnic population.
The documentary, which looks at the Palestine-Israeli conflict through the eyes of 16-year-old Ahed Tamimi and another young female activist, lacked counterbalance, the Info-communications Media Development Authority of Singapore (IMDA) said on its website.
The skewed narrative of the film is inflammatory and has the potential to cause disharmony amongst the different races and religions in Singapore, the IMDA said.
The documentary was due to have been shown at the Singapore Palestinian Film Festival on Thursday.
It was screened at a number of festivals worldwide in 2017 and won Best Documentary at the Respect Human Rights Film Festival in Belfast, but has become even more topical following Tamimis arrest last month.

Stepping into 2018 Shedding differences  on the road to Reconciliation
	
One of the primary pledges of the Sirisena -Wickremasinghe Government before and after assuming power was to attain national reconciliation and peace among different entities. Peace and reconciliation are prerequisites to nation building. It has been recurrently pointed out that although Sri Lanka may have achieved negative peace, positive peace is yet a dream.
In other words, there is general consensus that although the armed conflict may have ended in 2009, the more deeply rooted national conflict is far from being resolved. This requires affirmative action by the Governments laying down an institutional foundation which addresses the root causes of the conflict.  Moving on after a war that concluded almost a decade ago and stepping into 2018 it is essential that we look back and see where we stand on the road to reconciliation. 
The Institute of National Security Studies Sri Lanka (INSSSL) in association with the Ministry of National Integration and Reconciliation conducted a one-day conference on December 12 highlighting the Role of Youth in Reconciliation. The preliminary comments made by several dignitaries, who addressed the gathering at the event, were informative of how far Sri Lanka, as a country has travelled on the path of reconciliation and how far we need to go. 
Young children can be taught and inspired to integrate with children of communities not identified with ones own and can then influence adults in their respective families by their behaviour and progressive way of thinking
12, 000 ex-combatants rehabilitated socially
-Sivagnanasothy 
V. Sivagnanasothy, Secretary to the Ministry of National Integration and Reconciliation stressed upon the active role the ministry needs to play in the task of reconciliation.An integration approach needs to be taken in achieving reconciliation. President Sirisena is very concerned about this during this process.
Many steps have been taken already at the school level and also among religious leaders focusing on how such groups can contribute towards reconciliation. Young children, whose minds are fresh and untainted by prejudices, can be taught and inspired to integrate with children of communities not identified with ones own and can then influence adults in their respective families by their behaviour and progressive way of thinking, said Sivagnanasothy.
With the view of clearly indicating commitment on the part of the Government, Sivagnanasothy listed some of the other affirmative initiatives taken towards achieving reconciliation and assured that all issues identified will be translated into action plans in 2018.By now, over 12, 000 ex-combatants have been rehabilitated socially. However, the Government is yet to empower them economically in order to get them integrated into the community and mainstreamed in society. A housing programme to build 50,000 homes for conflict affected people and a sizable road development project are also in play. The Office on Missing Persons Act was passed last year and its work is in progress,
he added. 
If everyone practices what their religions teach, then the process of reconciliation and integration will be much easier. There wont be any war or any differences
Sivagnanasothy also placed emphasis on the role of the mediain reconciliation. 
The media can break or make peace. Media personnel must be cautious in reporting incident related to ethnic issues. They must be socially responsible and accountable, affirmed Sivagnanasothy. 
Correct faults and drive countrytowards peace
-Fowzie
State Minister Ministry of National Integration and Reconciliation AHM Fowzie speaking in all three languages drew special attention to the premise on which his Ministry was formed. 
This ministry was created by the President himself, which goes to show the devotion which both the President and the Prime Minister has towards this endeavor. We have to admit that this state of hatred among different races and religions was created by politicians who only believed in achieving narrow political aims. It is now high time that politicians realize this, correct their faults and drive the country towards the common goal of peace, he said. The minister states that its now too late to initiate change in the minds of adults who have preconceived notions about each community and carry with them grief of the past. However, he proposed that the youth can spearhead the process of societal change and attitudinal change. 
If everyone practices what their religions teach, then the process of reconciliation and integration will be much easier. There wont be any war or any differences. We have all come to this world for a short period. So lets not have discrepancies and misunderstandings, he pointed out. 
Reconciliation is a process which everyone must join
- Krishnasami
Thurka Krishnasami, a gender and humanitarian activist, who was a panelist at the conference, explored the concept of reconciliation and how it is perceived by
different people. 
Reconciliation is understood by different people in different ways, which makes it all the more difficult to talk about it to everyone. The general belief is that when there is development, there is reconciliation.
Reconciliation is understood by different people in different ways, which makes it all the more difficult to talk about it to everyone. The general belief is that when there is development, there is reconciliation
We need to shed that kind of narrow thinking and have a common or shared vision when it comes to reconciliation, whether it be within the Government, NGOs or among the general public. Reconciliation is a process which everyone must join. It is an integrated approach that we should be following.

Striking Indian low-caste workers bring chaos to Mumbai
	

REUTERS, 03rd JANUARY, 2018 - Many businesses in the Indian financial hub of Mumbai closed on Wednesday as protesters from a low-caste community blocked traffic and shopping malls and staged sit-ins on railway lines after clashes with right-wing Hindus.
The call for a general strike across the western state of Maharashtra led to largely peaceful protests, but life in many parts of Mumbai was disrupted with Dalits pelting buses with stones and deflating tires in some areas. Railway lines and some major roads leading into the city were blocked.
The Dalits, who rank at the bottom in Indias ancient caste hierarchy, called the strike in protest against attacks from right-wing groups in the city of Pune on Monday. The strike shut businesses and schools in Mumbai and other cities across the state.
The government didnt arrest the perpetrators of violence in Pune. Hindu group members were beating Dalits and the police were just watching from afar, said protester Sandeep Kamble. We are demanding the arrest of the culprits.

The importance of being mindful
	
Buddhist discussion on Poya day
While mindfulness has taken the west by storm with neuroscientists and psychiatrists recommending it to everyone across the globe. More than 2500 years ago Gautama Buddha espoused mindfulness as the gate keeper that protects his noble disciples. 
Drawing parallels between a well-protected fortress of a city and the life of a disciple, the Enlightened One had emphasized the centrality of mindfulness in the Simile of Fortress in Anguttara Nikaya. 
The Buddha pointed out that using mindfulness a noble disciple discerns skillful and unskillful thoughts and cultivates the skillful ones while abandoning the unskillful ones, thus paving the way for wisdom. The Buddha equated this mindfulness to the vigilance of a gatekeeper who carefully lets in the friends and loyalists while keeping away the enemy. 
This very topical theme was the focus on the afternoon Dhamma sermon of the English Dhamma programme of Mahamevnawa, held on January 1st (Duruthu Poya Day) at the Institute of Personnel Management, Colombo 5. 
Mahamevnawa, one of the largest Buddhist monastery networks in the world with over 40 local and overseas branch monasteries and about 700 monks under its wing, was founded by Ven. Kiribathgoda Gnanananda Thera.The Poya Day English Dhamma programme is organized every month under the guidance of the much respected Ven. Gnanananda Thera in view of disseminating Buddhas message to the English speaking followers of the Dhamma. Its specially aimed at enhancing the Dhamma knowledge of the Buddhist students attending private and international schools so that they can grow up to become noble citizens. 
A useful simile
Elaborating on the simile that was used, Ven. Kurunegala Rohanakitti Thera, who conducted the afternoon session of the programme, drove home the appropriateness of this simile including the word fortress drawing parallels between seven features of a fortress. These are features that should be present in the practice of all Buddhists.
 The Unshakable confidence towards the Buddha was compared to the, strong firm pillar dug half of the pillar to the ground, which is located in the front of the fortress and the deep and the wide moat or the canal around the fortress to the sense of shame of a disciple which keeps him away from the unwholesome. 
The Sutta which was delivered by the Enlightened One in Sravasti compares the road that encircles the fortress to the sense of concern of the repercussions of bodily, verbal and mental transgression and the weapons stored in the fort to the Dhamma knowledge stored and retained by The Buddhas disciples, by listening to Dhamma. The latter helps a disciple to differentiate between the wholesome and the unwholesome. 
Parallels have been drawn between the army including elephants and cavalry to persistence with which a disciple abandons the unskillful and cultivates the skillful and the ramparts to his discernment of the arising and passing away. 
The audience which comprised students from private and international schools and a sizeable adult crowd displayed keen interest for the topic with Ven. Rohanakitti Thera regularly posing questions to the audience to keep the session interesting and useful. The Thera also explained the steps taken by his teacher Ven. Kiribathgoda Gnananda Thera to ensure that the Sri Lnakan children who emigrate for higher studies are given an opportunity to continue their association with the Dhamma. Mahamevna through Mahamevna branch monasteries in the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, Canada and several other countries helps these students in their attempts to pursue the Dhamma.
The discussion on the Simile of Fortress was followed by a meditation session and another Sutta discussion.

Trump boasts of bigger nuclear button
	

North Korea reopened a long-closed border hotline with South Korea on Wednesday, hours after U.S. President Donald Trump appeared to mock the Norths leader by saying he has a bigger and more powerful nuclear button than he does.
The Norths decision to open the border phone line came a day after South Korea proposed high-level discussions amid a tense standoff over North Koreas missile and nuclear programmes.
That followed North Korean leader Kim Jong Uns New Year address in which he said he was open to speaking with the South and would consider sending a delegation to the Winter Olympics to be held just across the border in Pyeongchang in February. U.S. officials said Washington would not take any talks between North and South Korea seriously if they did not contribute to denuclearizing North Korea. A State Department spokeswoman said North Korea might be trying to drive a wedge of some sort.
Kim ordered the reopening of the hotline at the truce village of Panmunjom at 0630 GMT on Wednesday, when South Korean officials at the border received a call from the North, the Souths unification ministry said in a text message. Officials on both sides were checking the line and conducting a conversation for about 20 minutes, the contents of which were not disclosed by the ministry. That gesture came only hours after Trump, who has mocked Kim as Little Rocket Man, again ridiculed the North Korean leader on Twitter.
Will someone from his depleted and food starved regime please inform him that I too have a Nuclear Button, but it is a much bigger & more powerful one than his, and my Button works! Trump tweeted.
Trump and Kim have exchanged a series of bellicose comments in recent months, raising alarm across the world, with Trump at times dismissing the prospect of a diplomatic solution to a crisis in which North Korea has threatened to destroy the United States.

With fewer than 1,000 Sri Lankan Leopards in the wild, the birth of the cubs has been warmly welcomed by the zookeepers at Banham.
These endangered animals have bred successfully at the zoo for many years but this is the first time for Sariska and her mate Mias, wrote Harriet Orrell.
Michael Woolham, the zoos animal manager, saidits very exciting for the zoo.
Sariska has so far been a super mother - very attentive and protective. Im sure the cubs are going to grow up to be very healthy.Because Banham has a lot of experience with big cats and in particular Sri Lankan leopards, Mias was sent to us with theview that we might be able to persuade him to breed.
The cubs, now almost four months old, have had their veterinary checks and vaccinations and have been identifiedas two females.
Meanwhile, the Eastern Daily Press has launched a competitionto name thepair of baby leopards.
Banham Zoo said it would like the cubs to be given names associated with Sri Lanka and is inviting readers to send their suggestions.

We are only concerned about our security, safety and law
	
State Minister M.L.A.M. Hizbullah, in an interview with the Daily Mirror, spoke about the current political situation in the country and also aired his views about the happenings in the east. He said that cooperation is absent among the ministers and the situation cant continue as it is. Following are excerpts of the interview done with Hisbullah.
-It is unfair to blame Muslim Ministers for non-development of Tamil areas
-We even go behind officials to get our work done
-Previous Govt. did much work for us
-Muslim people were disappointed with the Rajapaksa rule because of BBS activities
-BBS is at large even during this Govt.
-SLFP and UNP Ministers do not cooperate with each other in the Unity Govt
-Im a state minister, but I was never invited even for a meeting by my Cabinet Minister
-If this situation persists, we cant continue to be in the Govt.
-Muslims arent that concerned about the cost of living
Q As a Muslim politician from the east, how do you view the preferences of the Government
It is ok. The last Government helped with our activities. It did rehabilitation work. We have no problem with the present Government. We are continuing with our work. As far as the Batticaloa District is concerned, there is no difference. We have funding arrangements made with the World Bank, Asian Development Bank and the European Union. The Government has decided to carpet 1000 kilometres of road in the Batticaloa District. Tenders have been called for it. We will be able to complete road building in the district within a couple of years 
Q As far as the Muslims are concerned, they voted overwhelmingly for this Government. How do they view the performance of the Government
More than 95 percent of Muslims voted for President Maithripala Sirisena. The situation is not bad for the Government even now. There is a slight change among the Muslims, though. Even in the Muslim areas, Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna is contesting. 
Q There is an allegation that money is disproportionately allocated for the development in Muslim areas overlooking Tamil areas. How do you view it as a leading politician from the area
It all depends on the politician concerned. We have to prepare proposals and meet with the ministers to get them implemented on the ground. I do it and go behind ministers, officials and funding agencies such as the World Bank. We push for the implementation of projects in our areas. The politicians hailing from Tamil areas dont do anything. They just talk in Parliament. One cant get anything done merely by talking in Parliament. When it comes to the elections, Tamils never vote for me nor any other Muslim politician. They vote for the Tamil National Alliance (TNA) only. After the elections, it is our duty to work in our area.
We do some work in Tamil areas, but thats not much. For example, I allocated Rs.25 million for school development in the Tamil areas. I allocated Rs.75 million for the Muslim areas. Even though I gave Rs.25 million, I did not get even a single vote from them. I built two schools in the Vavunathivu Division of Battocaloa by allocating Rs 25 million apportioned to me. Yet, I did not get even a single vote. I received only the Muslim votes. There were a few Tamil votes. Still, we do some help for them. Yet, Tamil politicians do not give even a single cent for us. There are four Tamil MPs here. They do not go behind the Ministers. They only talk in Parliament. 
Though I am a Minister, I go and meet Ministry Secretaries, Additional Secretaries, Directors, and Accountants etc. But, the Tamil MPs do not do it. Then, how can they develop their areas They have to work hard. That is why Muslim areas are developing. 
When it comes to bureaucrats at the District Secretariat, they are overwhelmingly Tamils. They give priority to Tamils areas in the allocation of money released by the Government. There is a lot of funding channelled through the District Secretariat. We wanted to appoint a Muslim as an additional District Secretariat. The Government refused this. It appointed a Tamil to the additional post. We (all the Muslim MPs) made a request for it to be given to a Muslim. The TNA objected. We appointed one in the past. But, the LTTE killed him. Later, nobody came forward. All the key officials- accountants, project directors, project coordinators  are Tamils.

Q With such vast division between the two communities, how can you achieve reconciliation
It is continuing. There has to be common allocation. Percentage wise, it should be similar. Officials always object even to the resettlement of the Sinhalese. Some kind of strict procedure has to be followed. 
Q In terms of national politics, how do Muslims view the situation
Muslims voted overwhelmingly for President Maithripala Sirisena for some reasons. Some Muslims arent happy today because they feel that what happened during the time of Mr. Rajapaksa is happening even now. Mr. Rajapaksas party has fielded strong Muslim candidates throughout the country. It means there is some kind of change in the thinking pattern of Muslims. Theres a slight tilt towards Mr. Rajapaksas party. 
Muslims arent that concerned about the cost of living. During our political meetings, we hardly talk about it. We are concerned about matters pertaining to the community. The former Government failed to take action against Ven. Gnanasara Thera of Bodu Bala Sena. He is at large even under the present Government. No one was arrested. At that time, there were incidents in Aluthgama and Beruwala. However, there were even incidents in Gintota after this Government assumed power. During the rule of Mahinda Rajapaksa, the Muslims had no issue other than problems created by Bodu Bala Sena.
The previous rulers didnt take any steps to control its (Bodu Bala Sena) activities. People now feel the situation hasnt changed even under the rule of President Sirisena. Muslims arent politically concerned about issues such as the cost of living and similar other things. I have been doing politics since 1989. I have never spoken about the cost of living and other related matters ever since. We are only concerned about our security, safety and law and order. 
Q When the cost of living is high, it affects your businesses. Muslims belong to a business community. How do you say it is not a matter of concern
It affects their business trades. But, it is not the main issue. When the elections come, it is not the main issue. 
Some Muslims arent happy today because they feel that what happened during the time of Mr. Rajapaksa is happening even now. Mr. Rajapaksas party has fielded strong Muslim candidates throughout the country.
Q How do you see the concept of the Unity Government
It is ok. But, it needs more understanding. There are ministers representing the United National Party (UNP) and Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP). They arent cooperating with each other. If we approach a UNP Minister, he will not help because we are from the other side. It happens the other way round too. There are state ministers appointed from either party. Their Cabinet Ministers dont give them any responsibility. I am a State Minister. My Cabinet Minister D.M. Swaminathan is from the UNP. He doesnt give one cent to me.
The Ministers of one party discriminates against the state ministers of the other party. There is a rift between the UNP and the SLFP. There are many issues in this Government.
There should be a clear demarcation of power among the Ministers, State Ministers and others. My minister does not give any work to me. He did not call me even for a single meeting during the past three years. I am fed-up. All the state ministers are fed up. 
Two state ministers even crossed over to the other side. If the situation continues like this, we cant work together.
