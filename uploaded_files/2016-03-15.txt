A non-functional functionary!
	
There is a fair ones? outfit functioning in the state sector. This outfit as its moniker suggests is intended to serve the interests of the fair ones. A unit of this outfit is active practically ?in every ministry, department and state establishment and the better half of the head of the ?ministry, ?department or ?the state institution by tradition becomes the ex-officio chairperson of its fair ones? unit.
?
However, there is a certain ministry with a fair ones? unit chaired by the daughter of the Cabinet rank purohita?s daughter, not by his better half.?
However, the fair ones of this ministry complain that this daughter let alone initiating any programme for the good of her kind in the ministry never participates in any activity of the fair ones. What is worse is that she holds herself uncommunicative despite the ministry fair ones? persistent bids to contact her. Meanwhile, the ministry employees, they say, are vying with one another in adducing the reasons as to why the daughter has been offered the chair of the fair ones? unit overlooking her mother.

Another 13 illegally-reared elephants recovered
	
The CID today informed the Colombo Chief Magistrate that it had taken into custody another 13 elephants which were being reared without valid licences.
The detectives made the detection during investigations into forged elephant licenses and alterations made to the wild elephant registration book.
They told the Magistrate that they had sent the elephants recovered by them to the Udawalawe Transit Centre and were now under the custody of the Wildlife Department.
Several such elephants being reared without valid licenses were recovered last year.
Earlier, the main suspects in the elephant racket Niraj Roshan alias Ali Roshan and two others were released on bail by the Magistrate.
Following submissions made by the defense counsel seeking the Magistrate?s attention to the poor health condition of elephants in the custody of the Wildlife Department, the Magistrate directed the Wildlife Department Director General to submit a detailed report on the annual births, deaths and the number of elephants in Sri Lanka on the next date of the hearing.
The Magistrate also directed the Wildlife Department to permit owners to see their elephants at Udawalawe transit centre twice a week.
Defense counsel R.A.P. Ranawaka told Court that the Government, Attorney General?s Department and those involved in the alleged offence should come to a settlement, since the inquiry and the investigations were continuing for almost a year.
Considering the absence of the Senior State Counsel who was appearing on behalf of Attorney General, the Magistrate put off the case for March 30, 2016. (Shehan Chamika Silva)

Malinga attacks new selection committee
	
Adding a new twist to the controversial selection of World Twenty20 squad, injured speedster Lasith Malinga yesterday made a scathing attack on cricket authorities for his selection to the squad despite a nagging injury.
Malinga was initially named captain for the World T20 tournament to defend the title they won two years back, but decided to step down after aggravating his injury during Sri Lanka?s only win at the Asia Cup against the UAE. He did not play a further part in the tournament but remained with the team.
?I told the selectors not to include me since I am not fit,? Malinga said.
?I said this before the Asia Cup and before they finalized the World T20 team, but they have selected me. I am not even 70 percent fit,? Malinga said while waiting for his flight to Kolkata at the Bandaranaike International Airport Lotus Lounge.
Malinga was among more than two hundred passengers off-loaded from a Mihin Lanka flight to Kolkata scheduled to depart at 6.30 am last morning due to a technical hitch and were due to depart at 3.30 p.m.
?Why not give that chance to a young player? I am injured. If I can?t play, I can?t play its simple and I don?t understand why they want me to play with an injury,? Malinga, who is the highest wicket taker in World Twenty20 with 38 wickets in 31 matches, added.
The former selectors led by Kapila Wijegunawardene dropped him after a discussion with the player but a dramatic turn of events, where those selectors were disbanded and a new selection committee led by Aravinda de Silva was installed just hours before team?s departure for the World T20, saw him being included. The new selection committee which also includes batting great Kumar Sangakkara thought a half-fit Malinga is more than sufficient to snare even the world?s best batsmen in? T20?s but Malinga says otherwise.
?From the little cricket I know I can tell you it?s not what you are that matters but what you can do in the middle. You may have all the record in the world but if you can?t give what the team expected from you then there?s no use,? he explained.
Malinga is suffering from a bone bruise, a traumatic injury he sustains from the forceful impact during bowling and goes through sever pains which last for weeks and months. The best and only way to help the healing process is to rest, support, and protect the bone or joint involved and to apply conventional treatments for trauma.
?There is no sign of immediate recovery as it needs time and no one knows how long it would take for the recovery process. I do not think I can recover any time soon,? he said adding that he would consider retiring from international cricket after the World Cup.
?Now that I am selected I will bowl in nets in the next two days to see whether I am fit enough to play the opening match. If all things go well I will play the opening match against Afghanistan on Thursday if not I will request them to get a replacement,? he added.
Malinga, 32, the world?s most feared T20 bowler with a sling-arm action, prematurely ended his test cricket career in 2011 due to the chronic knee injury he sustained playing for Sri Lanka in Australia back in February 2008, an injury that prevented him from playing ODI cricket for 16 months.

The Colombo High Court today reserved for tomorrow the order on the bail-revision application filed on behalf of former CSN senior executive Nishantha Ranatunga, who was remanded on charges of violating the Public Property Act.
Counsel Nalin Ladduwahetty PC informed Judge M.C.B.S. Morais that he had filed his written submissions in court and wished to mention a few more facts that had arisen in the course of granting bail to the other four suspects.
He said the main argument that the counsel for the other suspects had taken up in Court when seeking bail was the erroneous report filed before the Kaduwela Magistrate by the prosecution.
The Counsel said the prosecution should have filed a certificate by a Gazetted police officer when producing the suspects before the Kaduwela Magistrate to ascertain whether the suspects had violated the provisions of the Public Property Act.
He said the Police had only filed a report by an ASP which was erroneous and not a certificate in line with what is mentioned in the Public Property Act.
The Counsel said his client?s freedom could not be restricted by remanding him on the basis of the erroneous report.
He called the attention of the Court to the fact that his client had not interfered with the witnesses or the prosecution and had always co-operated with the prosecution during the its investigations.
The Counsel said his client did not at any time have any dishonest intentions while working as an executive officer of the CSN, adding that his client had ceased to function in his official capacity since 2013 and thereafter, had not held any position in the CSN.
He pleaded that his client be released on bail. (T. Farook Thajudeen)

The state government should exert pressure on the Centre to stop the arrest and harassment of Tamil Nadu fishermen by Sri Lankan naval forces, said DMK chief M Karunanidhi said on Tuesday.
"Writing letters to the Prime Minister alone will not stop harassment of Tamil Nadu fishermen. The ruling AIADMK has 37 MPs in the Lok Sabha, and the BJP government at the Centre needs their support. Using this opportunity, the state government must exert pressure on the Centre to find a solution to the issue," said Karunanidhi.
He said the chief minister was "cheating" the fishermen by writing letters to the Prime Minister. "When compared to India, Sri Lanka is a small nation and if India has a will to find a solution, it can do so," he said.
The central government should earnestly try to find a solution to the problem without any further delay, the DMK chief said. (Times of India)

One of the main constituent parties of the government, the United National Party (UNP) accused the joint opposition today of sabotaging the economic development programme and said that it would shortly make an interesting disclosure on the involvement of joint opposition in the recent blackouts and the ongoing crisis in the power sector.
This pledge was given by several ministers and deputy ministers at a rally and procession organised by the UNP-led National Youth Front and the young MPs of the party, and held at Lipton Circus this afternoon -- against the joint opposition which the party is accusing of sabotaging the country?s development policy.
Digital Infrastructure Minister Harin Fenando said the government would make an interesting disclosure on the recent power outage. He said the present government would run the country for ten years and deliver the goods. Elaborating, Mr. Fernando said the Norochcholai Power Plant which broke down 34 times was one of the main causes of the blackout.
Minister Sarath Fonseka said no one would be able to fool the people any longer as they were well informed of the ground situation in the country. ?The crooks who robbed the country will not be able to have their way any longer," he said.
Deputy Minister Sujewa Senasinghe said the government had so far created one hundred thousand jobs out of the one million it had promised. He said Development Strategies and International Trade Minister Malik Samarawickrema and Minister Sagala Ratnayake who had travelled to China recently had managed to create one hundred thousand jobs through Chinese investments here.
Deputy UNP Leader Sajith Premadasa requested the people to give the government some time to deliver the goods it had promised. He said time was needed to deliver the country from the debt trap.
The procession which commenced from Nelum Pokuna Mawatha proceeded to Lipton Circus where the speakers addressed the crowd from the cargo bed of a truck.
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe who participated in the rally was seen amidst the crowd. However he did not get on to the truck. (Yohan Perera and Chaturanga Pradeep)
