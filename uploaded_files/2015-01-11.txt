BASL wants CJ Shirani back
	
The Bar Association of Sri Lanka (BASL) had urged the newly elected President Maithripala Sirisena to arrange necessary measures to reinstate the 43rd Chief Justice Dr. Shirani Bandaranayake, who was impeached by Parliament in January 2013.
BASL Secretary Ajith Pathirana told that the BASL made this request at a meeting with President Maithripala Sirisena and the Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe on Saturday (10).
He told the Daily Mirror that it received a positive response from the President and Prime Minister and further stated the matter would be discussed at the BASL Executive Committee Meeting soon.
Pathirana stated that the BASL made a request to reinstate 43rd Chief Justice since she was subjected to political victimisation and lost her position through a wrongful impeachment procedure.
The BASL observed that the President of the republic has power to appoint the judges of the Supreme Court in accordance with the article 107 of the constitution.
Parliament voted to remove 43rd Chief Justice from office in January 2013 through an impeachment motion alleging corruption.
It was carried with 155 voting in favour and 49 against. However, she has denied the allegations. (LS)

Explosives strapped to girl kill 20 people at Nigerian market
	
Explosives strapped to a girl, who was described as young as 10 years old, detonated at a crowded marketplace in Nigeria, killing at least 20 people and injuring 18 others, according to police.
The police estimate differed with the local hospital's, which counted 51 people with blast injuries.
The suicide blast happened at the main entrance of the ever-crowded Monday Market, which is the city of Maiduguri's largest market. Around <U+200E>12:40 p.m. on Saturday, the girl was stopped for screening by vigilantes who man the gates of the market, according to witnesses and rescuers.
Among the 20 deaths included the girl, who detonated the improvised explosive device, said Gideon Jubril, Borno state's police spokesman.
Although no one has claimed responsibility, Boko Haram militants are the main suspects. ?
This was the fourth suicide attack on the city's market since last July.
Abur Babakura who was at the scene said the explosives detonated as the girl, who appeared about 10 years of age, was being screened with a metal detector at the market's entrance. It's standard procedure for people to be screened before entering the market.
"The metal detector beeped indicating she was carrying a metal under her dress, but it exploded before she could be singled out from the crowd," said Babakura.
"We believe that (there) was an accomplice watching from a distance pressed the remote," he said.
Two of the vigilantes manning the entrance were among the dead, he said. Many of wounded victims taken to Maiduguri Specialist Hospital have life-threatening injuries, said Musa Kyarimi, a nurse there.
The marketplace in Maiduguri has been a frequent target. More than 45 people were killed in late November last year in a twin suicide attack and more than 10 others died in another suicide blast a week later on December 1. Another suicide bombing on July 1 left at least 15 people dead and several injured.
Boko Haram has terrorized northern Nigeria regularly since 2009, attacking police, schools, churches and civilians, and bombing government buildings. It has also kidnapped students, including more than 200 schoolgirls who were abducted in April and remain missing.
Maiduguri is the capital of Borno State. The deadly Saturday blast came after a bloody massacre in Baga, a fishing town about 125 miles away, where Boko Haram militants killed hundreds, possibly as many as 2,000 people. That massacre has been described as Boko Haram's deadliest act by Amnesty International.
The Islamist group, whose name translates to "Western education is sin" has said its aim is to impose a stricter form of Sharia law across Nigeria, which is split between a majority Muslim north and a mostly Christian south. (CNN)

Video: UNP - UPFA trying to destabilise
	
	The UNP today unveiled what it called a ?shocking attempt? allegedly made by former President Mahinda Rajapaksa and his brother Gotabaya to deny the victory to President Maithripala Sirisena by blocking the counting of votes and thereby declaring the winner by Elections Commissioner with the assistance of Army Commander, the Inspector General of Police and the Attorney General early Friday morning.
	Media Director of the UNP and Matara District Parliamentarian Mangala Smaraweera told the media at the office of the Leader of the Opposition, that the good officials in one voice had refused to cooperate with the two and prevented a possible blood bath in the country and saved democracy.
	Mr. Samaraweera said one of the first priorities of the new cabinet would be to probe this conspiracy and bring the culprits to book.
	The people of this country and the global community should know what was going on behind the curtain after the election, he said.
	?We have credible information that the Army Commander, Police Chief and Attorney General were called to the Temple Trees at 1.00 a.m. on Friday and checked with them a way to stop counting of votes immediately when the two knew that they were losing the election.
	?Fortunately, the Army Commander and the IGP have told Mahinda and Gotabaya in no uncertain terms that they could not be a party to this illegal attempt and not ready to give unlawful orders to men under their command.
	?Attorney General has said the illegal and unconstitutional action will have extremely dangerous repercussions. The modus operandi of the two brothers was to grab power through a military coup. The people of this country and the global community should know this,? Mr. Smaraweera charged.
	Mr. Smaraweera said the government was thankful to the three top officials for their bold step and added Army Commander though was with the last government and even printed a booklet in support of former President Rajapaksa he has acted responsibly at this occasion and the government appreciated it.
	There was huge pressure on the Police and Army from the UPFA government to support its election campaign but they acted independently to the maximum level possible and IGP N.K. Illangakone had done a good job, he added.
	?The best example is the canard spread on Sunday to the effect that the Army camps in the north had been stoned, which the Army spokesman had to call a press conference to dismiss it,? he stressed.
	Mr. Samaraweera charged that a Police SI and a member of the ?Nil Balakaya? had spread this fib through SMS with the assistance of a tele-drama actor, according to intelligence reports.
	Commenting on the formation of the new Cabinet and maintaining a simple majority in Parliament, Mr. Samaraweera expressed confidence that the government would be able to garner support from members of the UPFA but added if not the government did not have a choice but going for a snap parliamentary elections.
	??Let?s wait until January 19, the day Parliament meets in the New Year for the first time. We expect that all will go smoothly and we will be able to carry out our 100 day programme without much hassle,? he said.
	He said the Cabinet would not be as big as the previous UPFA Cabinet. The Cabinet restriction is valid only for the Cabinet appointed after the Parliamentary poll.
	Mr. Samaraweera also said action could not be taken against State media but against individuals who used State media for mud-slinging and misinformation and added a mini budget would be presented in the first week of February.(Sandun A Jayasekera)WATCH

The Jathika Hela Urumaya (JHU) and several other politicians who backed President Maithripala Sirisena at the presidential election today announced setting up a special fact finding unit to gather information on large scale corruption that is alleged to have taken place in the country during past ten years.
JHU General Secretary and Member of Parliament Patali Champika Ranawaka told a media briefing that this unit had been set up to move away from a political culture, where those who face allegations of corrupt were cleared of all charges after they shift sides, whenever there was a regime change.
?We will not allow those who are charged with corruption to get away this time as it had happened in the past and they will be eventually behind bars,? the MP said.
He said there are reports of large scale corruption that alleged to have taken place in the sectors of road development, power and energy and also on the misuse of State property. In this context he said as much as Rs. 100 million had been spent for the recent election from the State funds.
?Allegations are made against powerful persons in the previous regime and also against some powerful persons in the private sector and none of them will get away,? Mr. Ranawaka said.
Therefore, he urged those who are aware of the details on large scale corruption in the State sector and others to inform the unit of all details pertaining to the same. He assured that the identities of those who provide information would be confidential.
JHU Propaganda Secretary Nishantha Sri Waranasinghe said they had already received information on corruption and also information on LTTE activists.
He revealed that the LTTE Leader Kumaran Pathmanathan had not left the country and the defence sector authorities were in touch with him.
Former UNP Member of the Western Provincial Council Shiral Laktilake announced that one could provide information on phone or by fax on 011 2884583 or mail on anticorruptionfront2@gmail.com
Responding to a question raised by the journalists on the fate of those that backed the new president who face corruption charges, former UNP Member of the Southern Provincial council Maithri Gunaratne said everyone would be dealt with. (Yohan Perera and Sanath Desmond)?
