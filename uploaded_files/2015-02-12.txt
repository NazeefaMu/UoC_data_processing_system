No one will be able to replace me - Gota
	
One of the most influential figures of the Rajapaksa regime, he was admired by many, feared by some and hated by others. With many allegations made against him following the end of the Rajapaksa rule, former Defence Secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa spoke to? and responded candidly to the accusations that are being made against him, on the speculations made concerning his entry to politics and why he believes he is irreplaceable. . .Q.? Is it true that you fled to the Maldives as soon as the election results indicated former President Rajapaksa?s defeat?
You can see me now, I wouldn?t be here if I left, would I? . . .These claims are only part of the mud-slinging campaigns.Q. So you never left the country at any point after the Presidential polls?
No! (laughs) How can I leave like that? This is again absurd because I am not an invisible person to flee in that manner. Do they? think its possible for me to secretly escape like that? I would have to pass through the airport and I am not an invisible person to be able to pull off such a feat.Q You had refuted allegations levelled at you by Minister Ravi Karunanayake about the Defence Ministry account in the Bank of Ceylon. But an issue concerning the legality of the account persists?
Issues have been raised on the need to obtain parliamentary approval but there is no such thing. Cabinet approval is sufficient; it is the responsible authority and it is the normal procedure.
The point is, the account remains under the Defence Ministry and contains funds that were used exclusively for the construction of the Defence headquarters. Cabinet approval was granted to maintain a Defence Ministry account and not for a private account under my name.
Procedural matters are a separate issue and for argument?s sake, various parties can raise varied concerns. The money is with the Government, the Treasury was fully aware of the account and the value of the money deposited in it. The transactions relating to the account were fully divulged, it?s auditable and was maintained by the Chief Accountant. The money withdrawn from the account was carried out in strict adherence to State procedures. So instead of making allegations, the best course of action would be to study the situation and probe into the operations carried out in Akuregoda using the money. Without these finances that project would have been in jeopardy. It?s a crime if that was to happen and ultimately the former President would have been blamed for that too.
It is a good project but was delayed for a prolonged period due to the difficulty in accessing the necessary funds for implementation.
The land plot was allocated many years ago but construction could not be commenced due to unavailability of funds and this was the only way to make it a reality. Otherwise if we were to depend on allocations, it would have been delayed further? It is also important to note that I have not signed a single cheque for the money in the account.
I authorized only the expenses and that too was carried out in strict adherence to required procedures including fulfillment of technical evaluations and tender procedures.
The cheques were issued under the signature of the Chief Accountant and several other officials who were authorized to issue cheques. Before making accusations, they should take note of why there was a necessity to maintain this type of an account. The Defence Ministry will be in a very difficult position? to continue the Akuregoda project if the money is not released back to remain under the authority of the Defence Ministry.Q What is your response to the accusations being levelled at you and your brother?s regime concerning the course of action followed regarding top LTTE leaders such as KP?
Again, the accusations they are making with concern to this issue are baseless. If you could speak to the intelligence officials on these matters you would realise it.
I believe the governing politicians should investigate without simply making allegations. I have already stated this - whatever possible steps to take we have taken but the most important thing was getting the man. No one is commenting on that. Instead unnecessary facts are highlighted and they are not true. The most important factor is that he claimed he was the next in line for LTTE leadership and we managed to take him into our custody.Q But why wasn?t he prosecuted after being taken into custody?
There were different schools of thought during the time regarding the course of action to be taken concerning him.
When hundreds of the LTTE cadres surrendered, there were two options availableeither to imprison them or rehabilitate and reintegrate them. Both choices have pluses and minuses but it became obvious that imprisoning such a large number would definitely be disastrous.
So during the time all the responsible officials including the President, the Security Chiefs decided that they should be rehabilitated. Likewise, when this person was brought in, the war was over so he was handed over to the intelligence in order to obtain the information they required. If we had arrested him and put him behind bars, he would not have co-operated. My aim was to get him to fully cooperate with the intelligence officials. So he did not remain scott-free - he was under the military intelligence and that in turn helped gather so much of information on the LTTE businesses and the networks run by the terrorist group.
If the incumbent government wishes to act responsibly, they can speak to those who have conducted the inquiries and access the intelligence the relevant officials managed to obtain, provided it is done in a way that does not jeopardise national security.Q You are accused of taking control over his fleet of ships and the vast wealth that he had accumulated for the LTTE. What is your response and what became of this wealth?
This is why I am stating that this information should be inquired into by the intelligence agencies. They would be able to clarify whether there was any wealth, what properties included that wealth etc.? All these agencies are under the Government and I don?t wish to speculate on anything. The information is easily accessible to the present Government and they should inquire into it. ?Q What do you have to say about the allegations levelled at the military intelligence apparatus being used to for non-military purposes that included procuring information on the former President?s political rivals?
The military should not be discredited because they conduct themselves in a very professional manner. The measures that I took to improve the intelligence agencies can be studied by the President and the State Minister for Defence and they will be amazed by the effort I have taken to improve these agencies and their professionalism and this included freeing these institutions from political interferences. It is due to these measures I took, that we were able to maintain the security even after the end of the war. No one knows these things and even I should not discuss these matters because these are professional, State-owned agencies.
Rather than making wild allegations, be responsible, speak to these people and get to know what has been carried out for their betterment. I am sure they must have already taken these measures so I urge them to continue the work and improve the quality and the professionalism of the military. I have never done anything to harm them or politicise them.? Everything was purely done in the interest of the country?s security.Q Is it true that you have bought over many State-owned properties including the Ceylon Steel Corporation?
I don?t own a single thing. Investigative journalists should probe into these allegations and find out whether there is any truth in these accusations.
?Investigate and see if I own a property anywhere or whether there are any accounts in which I have amassed wealth or if I have invested millions of money in any shares.Q But the allegation is that you have used front men in order to conceal your ownership of these establishments/ businesses?
These are useless allegations, anyone can make such claims! What is the use of owning anything if I cannot enjoy it when I wish to? It is not logical for me to not be able to enjoy the perks of whatever properties or wealth that they claim I have accumulated. The truth is I don?t even have a house to live in still. I am trying to buy a house because the house that I currently live in is owned by my mother-in-law and she was living here for 40 years. I currently use this house because she is living in the US. If I had that much money wouldn?t I buy a house for myself?
Look at the other politicians, even those who make these allegations against me? Look at the amount of properties they have collected. If they are so genuine, they must declare how they managed to buy the properties they currently own. Look at Mr. Ravi Karunanayake himself. The house in which he resides, in which year did he purchase that house?
This house next door to me was mine - I built it when I was in the army in 1987 upon taking a loan from the State Mortgage Bank. Unfortunately in 2001, I sold it for Rs. six million and that money I invested in Treasury bills. To this day I have not withdrawn them and they remain maturing and re-investing. I could have taken that money to the US but I never did that. But today, I am not even in a state to buy back my own house. These are baseless allegations but people will come to know the truth in time. If I had all that wealth,I would have gone to Dubai and bought a mansion there and lived comfortably. ?
If you had money what would be your priorities? I have only one son, I have educated him in one of the first-class Universities in the world, the Duke University - not during this period, when I was in the US. He managed to obtain a full scholarship to continue to his degree course purely on his merit. Upon graduation, he was immediately recruited to work for Boeing on a space station project as an electrical engineer. If anyone is interested they can check his credentials. So there is no need for me to gather so much wealth - that is the truth. We are not rogues.Q You are accused of being responsible for the death of two journalists including former Sunday Leader founder/editor Lasantha Wickramatunga by one of the former Ministers. What is your response to this allegation?
People know his credibility, you know his credibility - the type of man he was and continues to be - so I don?t have to talk about that. He has carried out similar actions against many other figures over the course of the years including former President Kumaratunga and has made defamatory statements against many politicians including the present Prime Minister Ranil Wickramasinghe. The statements that he himself has made will bear witness to the credibility of his claims and character. Also go back and see what he has told about the current President at the time.
During the previous government, the biggest allegation was him, even for the media. So why take his word seriously now?Q Would you say that continuing to accommodate Ministers with such shattered credibility records during your brother?s regime, resulted in a loss of faith in the minds of the people concerning his governance? ?
That was a mistake! Definitely! Not punishing them at the correct time. It?s not right for me to comment on it because it was not my business. But when it came to taking action on matters under my purview, I have implemented them without fail.Q Are you planning to take any legal action against these allegations that are being levelled against you?
No, it is a useless endeavour. Under the present system, there is no point in trying to take action against this type of allegations. Look at what happened to the Sunday Leader case.? I went to Courts and it has been over seven years and still the case is continuing. That is when we were in power. People might have thought, when we are in power we can manipulate the judicial system according to our whims and fancies.? If it was possible, would I be going to Courts still to resolve the case that I filed? My cross examinations are still not over.
That is a good example to prove that the judicial system was in fact not pressured to carry out the wishes of the previous government. I sought judicial assistance because everyone advised me it was the best course of action to take. But even after so many years nothing has happened. So what is the use of going to Courts? These are the facts that need to be highlighted. ?Q Speculations were made of your likely entry to politics at the upcoming general elections and you too seemed interested in it. Would you continue with the plan? ?
No, no. During the previous government I was given the responsibility of certain tasks and I did them with commitment. I am certain, anyone can look at my work, judge me and state without any prejudice that I have carried them out with utmost dedication. I worked to end the war and thereafter did everything to maintain the law and order, which was a very challenging task. Then, I was given the responsibility of the Urban Development Authority and the results of? my work are visible to everyone.
These successes could be achieved within a short period due to my commitment. Today, despite the criticisms, what are the instructions that have been given to the officials who were previously working under me? To continue the work. If what I did was wrong, they would have changed it instead of continuing them. That shows that what I have done is right. It is good that they are continuing with the work and it must continue.? ?
I have not engaged in ad hoc decision making - every step has been taken with a clear vision and target in mind. It is not one or two projects that I was handling, so many including urban development as well as the welfare of soldiers, professionalising the military, rehabilitation of war heroes, the Kotelewala Defence School.? . . If I did not have a plan all these things would have collapsed within a short periodQ So you are certain of not entering politics?
Yes (laughs) I am not a politician, I am a dedicated government servant. I have done so much and I can tell without any fear or uncertainty, that no one will be able to replace me. I challenge anyone, try and replace my commitment, my hard work and my vision - no one can.(Lakna Paranamanna)

China eager to preserve economic ties with Lanka-Jiarui
	
	China considers it important to preserve and further develop the traditional economic cooperation which it has had with the Sri Lankan government, a top Chinese official said today.
	Chinese People?s Political Consultative Conference (CPCC) Vice President Wang Jiarui, who met Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe together with a delegation at Temple Trees last evening, told the media that China considers it important that the traditional economic ties which it had with Sri Lanka is maintained and further developed. He said this was the message he had conveyed to the new Sri Lankan government on behalf of his own state.
	Mr. Jiarui, who is also a leading member of the Chinese Communist Party, said that his party and the Chinese government as a whole was looking towards developing ties with the United National Party (UNP) and also with the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) further.
	Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said the new government could resolve whatever issues it has with China through dialogue. ?Our government is also keen to maintain the traditional it has ties with China and is willing to have a dialogue to resolve whatever issues that exist between the two countries at present,? he said.
	He recalled that it was a UNP government which signed Sri Lanka?s first trade agreement with China which was carried forward by different governments that followed. Mr. Wickremesinghe also said that several former Prime Ministers such as the late S. W. R. D Bandaranaike and his wife Sirimavo and also late President J. R. Jayewardene maintained close ties with China during their time in office.
	The meeting between the Prime Minister and the Chinese delegation comes in the background of speculation whether the Chinese funded Colombo Port city Development Project would be allowed to go ahead with the new regime of the view that the project should go ahead within a legal frame work.

Video: Govt. to compensate victimized UNPers
	
A memorandum will be submitted to the Cabinet soon to provide redress to those who had been subjected to political victimisation from 1994 to 2015, UNP General Secretary and Minister Kabir Hashim said today.
Mr. Hashim told a media briefing that at least 30,000 persons who were subjected to political victimisation from the UNP alone would benefit from this move.
The UNP General Secretary who referred to a party which was held at Temple Trees for UNP organizers, provincial council members and others yesterday said its expenses were borne by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe. ?Only private funds of Mr. Wickremesinghe were used for this get-together,? Mr. Hashim assured. He said this was held to felicitate all UNPers who worked towards the victory of common opposition candidate Maithripala Sirisena at the Presidential elections this year.
Meanwhile Mr. Hashim said the UNP had decided to strengthen its party machinery to face the upcoming general elections.
Responding to a question raised by journalists as to whether the return of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa to politics would be a challenge to the UNP, he said it would not as the party was able to beat the ruling party candidate at the presidential elections despite the claim made by many that it would be difficult for the opposition to defeat him. ?We are confident that the UNP would get a majority of seats at the general election,? he said.

Govt. to extend 48hr detention law
	
	The government was preparing to extend the Procedure to detain a suspect arrested without a warrant up to 48 hours by another two years, a top source said.
	?It would seriously affect on country?s Human Rights records,? Human Rights Commissioner Dr. Prathibha Mahanamahewa said today.
	The government is preparing to extend the provisions of Code of Criminal Procedure (Special Provision) Act No.2 of 2013 by another two years enabling to detain a suspect arrested without a warrant up to 48.
	Dr. Mahanamahewa said that the amendments made to the Code of Criminal Procedure (Special Provision) Act were passed in Parliament in 2013 for a period of two years.
	He said the government was preparing to extend it for another two years in contrast to the LLRC recommendations that an arrested person should be produced before a Court soon after the arrest was made.
	?The provisions of this controversial Act which was passed by Parliament for two years are to be expired by this week.
	?We reliably got to know that this government is also preparing to extend it for another two years. It would badly affect for country?s Human Rights situation because we have already undertaken to implement LLRC recommendations to protect and promote human rights,? he said.(Lakmal Sooriyagoda)

India must support NPC plea for probe into genocide: VCK
	
Viduthalai Chiruthaigal Katchi (VCK) Leader Thol Thirumavalavan on Wednesday urged the Indian Centre to support the resolution passed by the Northern Provincial Council in Sri Lanka at the UN Human Rights Council in March 2015, demanding a thorough probe and report on the genocide of Tamils.
In a statement in Chennai, Thirumavalavan said evidences for the genocide had been given in the resolution which detailed the forced surgeries on women to prevent child birth, forced abortions and massacre of over 140,000 Tamils.
Tamil Nationalist Alliance Chief Minister CV Wigneswaran had said the new government had not taken action to restore the 6,500 acres snatched by Lankan military from Tamils.
According to the New Indian Express, Thirumavalavan has said the new President Maithripala Sirisena was a minister in former president Mahinda Rajapaksa?s cabinet, while General Sarath Fonseka, who implemented the genocide had become his military adviser, he said.
In such a situation, the question was whether Tamils would get justice if Sri Lankan government itself conducted the probe, Thirumavalavan said.
Sri Lanka had sought US help to postpone tabling the report at the UN Human Rights Council at the UN session in March 2015.? Sirisena was also trying to get Indian government?s support, the VCK leader said and asserted that the Centre should not help the Lankan government.
The Centre should support the NPC resolution and introduce it in the UN meeting, he added.
The NPC resolution had said ?The UN Security Council should refer the situation in Sri Lanka to the International Criminal Court for prosecutions based on war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide?.
PMK leader S Ramadoss also made a similar plea urging the Centre to reject requests from Lanka to support its efforts to scuttle the UN probe report.

	The Jathika Hela Urumaya (JHU) today submitted a file to the Inland Revenue Department (IRD) against former President?s Chief of Staff Gamini Senarath on alleged frauds committed by him.
	JHU National Organiser Nishantha Sri Warnasinghe said the IRD Commissioner General Wasanthi Manchanayake had assured them that she would inform the JHU within a month after going through the allegations.
	Mr. Warnasinghe said based on their findings it was evident that Mr. Senarath could not have accrued a large amount of wealth by legal means during a short period of time.
	?We requested the Department to look into whether Mr. Senarath had earned money by legal means adhering to three, four and five sections of the Inland Revenue Act No. 10 published in 2006, to find if he had submitted reports on his income and to find out whether the taxes and fines were imposed if he had earned income illegally,? he said.
	He alleged Mr. Senarath of acquiring money in large amounts from various groups and places including casino owners, Chinese nationals, the Temple Trees and many other places.
	He also alleged Mr. Senarath of his involvement in a number of land and property scams.

	External Affairs Minister Mangala Samaraweera today said alongside his invitation for US Secretary of State, John Kerry to visit Sri Lanka, he will also be inviting UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon to visit the country and added that discussions will also begin to institute a truth-seeking mechanism in a step towards promotion reconciliation.
	The Minister made this statement on Wednesday speaking at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washington on ?Sri Lanka after the Presidential Election?.
	During his speech, the Minister said discussions would commence by the end of this month with officials from South Africa to institute a truth-seeking mechanism suitable for Sri Lankan circumstances that would function parallel to the accountability mechanism.
	?But unlike the South African version, it won?t be for the purpose of amnesty but to facilitate healing and the reconciliation process of the victims,? he added.
	The Minister also said in a further step towards promoting reconciliation, Sri Lanka would also explore ways and means to harness the potential of the Sri Lankan diasporas to contribute towards local reconciliation and development efforts. Furthermore he stated that the government will be taking up the matter of the Assistance and Protection to Victims and Witnesses Bill in the parliament within this month.
	The External Affairs Minister had also spoken on the foreign policy of Sri Lanka under the new government and had described the shift observed in foreign policy for the past few years during the Rajapaksa regime as an ?aberration? as it was uncharacteristic of Sri Lanka to have shifted away from its traditional foreign policy.
	?Sri Lanka now seeks to renew its engagement with the world community,? he had said while referring to his invitation to the UN Human Rights Council Chief Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein to Sri Lanka and added, ?I will be inviting the Secretary of State tomorrow to visit Sri Lanka and will also invite the UN Secretary General when I meet him on Friday,? he said.
	Mr. Samaraweera also urged the international community including the human rights community to be patient.
	?This is a time of fragile transition and the GoSL is committed to the success of this journey while strengthening democracy, good governance and rule of law while ensuring the promotion and protection of human rights of all her citizens,? he said.
	Meanwhile, international media quoted Minister Samaraweera stating in Washington that Sri Lanka is seeking a delay of several months in the release of the UN report on the alleged abuses committed by both parties during the final phases of the war.? ?Once the report is finalized, we are hoping they can refer it to our domestic mechanism for action. . . We are hoping they could hold on to it until our mechanism is in place ? maybe August, you know, or so,? the Minister was quoted as telling the media. (Lakna Paranamanna)

No armouries in Hambantota: Namal
	
Denying allegations made by the government MPs that there are private armouries in Hambantota, the UPFA MP Namal Rajapaksa yesterday said violence were unleashed in the area only during the 1980s.
Mr. Rajapaksa was referring to some allegations made by Minister of Housing and Samurdhi Sajith Premadasa in Parliament yesterday.
Also Mr Rajapaksa requested the government MPS not to insult the SLFP youth movement. He however accepted that the Nil Balakaya was engaged in canvassing during the presidential elections but pointed out that it never engaged in any political violence.
He recalled that SLFP had won several elections in the past but never unleashed violence on the losing rivals.
Mr? Rajapaksa questioned as to why the present regime is unleashing violence on SLFP members when the party had pledged its support for the hundred day programme.
Earlier Minister Premadasa said there are several privately owned armouries in Hambantota. He listed out the names of some underworld figures who led violence during elections.
Mr Premadasa accused the Nil Balakaya which he called Sunaka Balakaya of engaging in violence during the presidential elections. (Yohan Perera and Kelum Bandara)

PM to get powers to sack corrupt officials
	
	Standing Orders of Parliament will be amended to empower the Prime Minister to take action against officials in state enterprises found guilty of mismanagement, financial frauds and corruption by the Committee on Public Enterprises (COPE), COPE Chairman DEW Gunasekara said.
	He said the amendment would require the Prime Minister to inform Parliament within six months as to the actions taken on the allegations levelled against public enterprises which have been charged with acts of corruptions and fraud in the final COPE report.
	?This is our response to the displeasure expressed by Parliamentarians about the inability to take prompt action against officials in public enterprises found guilty of acts of corruption during their tenure. In the final reports submitted to Parliament during the past few years, I have named several loss-making public enterprises and those whose performance has been below par and named those who were responsible for such acts of mismanagement, financial irregularities and corruption but it has been of no avail in the absence of a proper mechanism to take action against them,? Mr. Gunasekara who was also a former Minister of Human Resources told Daily Mirror.
	Another amendment to SOs is that the Chairmen of COPE and the Public Accounts Committee must be members of the opposition. Amendments are expected to be presented in Parliament within the next two weeks and passed by April.
	Mr. Gunasekara said the COPE final report for 2014 with details on the inquiries carried out on 244 government-owned enterprises would be handed over to Speaker Chamal Rajapaksa in March.
	In its Interim Report, Mr. Gunasekara was highly critical on the non-compliance with rules and regulations, inefficiency and non-transparent transactions in a majority of state ventures despite repeated requests by COPE to get their act together.
	Mr. Gunasekara said two adverse opinions in respect of two institutions was the recommendation for the removal of Chairmen and General Managers at certain state ventures through requests made to relevant ministers.
	?The COPE in all its previous reports to Parliament has repeatedly emphasized the need to maintain financial and administrative discipline at public enterprises. To ensure the smooth financial management, the COPE has appointed a special body of inquiry comprising COPE members. COPE has completed 598 inquiries within a period of four years as opposed to 670 during 31 years since 1979,? Mr. Gunasekara said adding that it was a record in the history of the legislature.
	He said on a directive by the Committee, the State-owned companies registered under the Companies Law have now been brought under the scrutiny of COPE and it has been able to contribute appreciably towards the enhancement of good governance in so far as parliamentary control on finance was concerned.
	Mr. Gunasekara thanked the Auditor-General?s Department, the Department of Public Enterprises and the Department of National Budget of the General Treasury for their co-operation. (Sandun A Jayasekera)
