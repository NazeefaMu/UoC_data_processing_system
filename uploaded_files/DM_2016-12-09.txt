South Korea Parliament votes to impeach President Park Geun-hye
	
South Koreas Parliament today voted to impeach President Park Geun-hye, an aloof conservative who took a hard line against North Korea and rose to power with strong support from those who revered her father, the military dictator Park Chung-hee, the New York Times reported.
The vote against Ms. Park, the nations first female leader, followed weeks of damaging disclosures in a corruption scandal that has all but paralyzed the government and produced the largest street protests in the nations history. Her powers will now be suspended as the Constitutional Court considers whether to remove her from office.
Ms. Park has been accused of allowing a shadowy confidante, the daughter of a religious sect leader, to exercise remarkable influence on matters ranging from choosing top government officials to her wardrobe, and of helping her extort tens of millions of dollars from South Korean companies. The scandal, which gained national attention less than two months ago, has cast a harsh light on collusion between the presidency and big business in one of Asias most dynamic economies.
A total of 234 lawmakers voted for impeachment, well over the required two-thirds threshold in the 300-seat Parliament. The vote was by secret ballot, but the outcome indicated that nearly half of the 128 lawmakers in Ms. Parks party, Saenuri, had joined the opposition in moving to oust her.
Parliaments motion for impeachment, accusing Ms. Park of extensive and serious violations of the Constitution and the law, will now be taken up by the Constitutional Court, which has six months to decide whether the charges are true and merit her ouster.
Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn, a former prosecutor and staunch defender of Ms. Park, will serve as acting president in the meantime. If the court votes to remove Ms. Park, South Korea will hold an election for a new president in 60 days.

UN findings on use of torture: Govt. to take due note
	
In response to the UN Committee Against Tortures (CAT) findings that torture is a common tactic adopted by the police in Sri Lanka, the government yesterday said it would take due note of the UN panels recommendations in working to improve accountability, prevent torture, to take legal action against those who commit torture and in carrying out the necessary institutional reforms.
The UN Committee, on Wednesday, opined that torture was routinely used by Sri Lankan law enforcement authorities regardless of the suspected offence and it called for a probe into the allegations of torture of detainees.
An expert, who was part of the committee, Felice D. Gaer has said that the Sri Lankan government has not embarked on institutional reform of the security sector.
Issuing a statement yesterday, the Foreign Affairs Ministry said Sri Lanka is engaged with the Committee Against Torture in keeping with its Treaty obligations, and commitment, under the leadership of President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe to ensure that the human rights of all citizens in the country, rule of law, and good governance are assured.
It further said Sri Lanka appreciated the Committees recognition of the positive steps taken by the Government since January 2015 to end torture. "Among several measures which have been initiated by the government to address allegations of torture, is an indicator-based Human Rights Plan for the next five years which is being developed through an inclusive stakeholder process, it said.

## Title: Animal Welfare Bill in need of immediate enactment
## Section: News Features
## Date: 9 December 2016 12:00 am
Animal Welfare Bill in need of immediate enactment
	
On November 22, the Cabinet approved a Bill focusing on elephants kept domestically, which also included banning young elephants being used for work. The regulations proposed by Sustainable Development and Wildlife Minister, Gamini Jayawickrama Perera are also reported as including a set of guidelines that should be adhered to by those seeking to rear domestic elephants. Some of the main areas of focus underlined include the responsibilities of the caretakers and owners towards the elephants kept domestically, regulations on elephants being used for work and the use of elephants in processions. This proposal also falls under amendments to Flora and Fauna Act No.22 of 2009. 
While due appreciation is given to the positive change towards the treatment of elephants by seeking to prevent them from being subjected to cruelty, it also needs to be noted that it has been almost a year since the Cabinet approval for the draft Animal Welfare Bill was received. Unfortunately the Bill still remains at the Legal Draftsmans office, while many animal welfare activists eagerly await its enactment. Almost a decade in the making, the draft bill was approved by the Cabinet following the public consultation that was last held in 2015. Following the proposed changes received by the public consultation, the Cabinet approval for the Bill was received on January 13, 2016. From this point, the Bill was passed to the legal draftsman for the changes to be incorporated into it and for it to be drafted with the changes included. 
The last amendment to the law addressing cruelty to animals in Sri Lanka was made in 1955. The Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Ordinance of 1907, under which the welfare of animals is taken into consideration is over a century old, with outdated fines and implemented on rare occasions and therefore in need of urgent reform. 
Attorney-at-Law, Vositha Wijenayake, Convener of Animal Welfare Coalition of Sri Lanka said, The AWC is appreciative of the changes proposed to safeguard elephants from being subjected to cruelty which were approved by the Cabinet. It is equally important to know when the proposed law on animal welfare will be enacted. This Bill has been on its way to get to this point for a very long time. I think everyone is eager to know when this could turn into law which will help uphold animal welfare in Sri Lanka. 
Civil Society Organisations and actors have highlighted the need for more humane animal welfare laws in the country for many years. As a result of these calls, the draft Animal Welfare Bill was tabled in Parliament. The Bill was presented to Parliament in October, 2010 by Venerable Athuruliye Rathana Thera as a private member bill. The new legislation proposed has as its objective the replacement of the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Ordinance of 1907 and to recognise duty of care for persons in charge of animals to treat animals humanely, to prevent cruelty to animals, to secure the protection and welfare of animals, to establish a National Animal Welfare Authority and Regulations and Codes of Practice and to raise awareness on animal welfare. 
In order to have a good animal welfare system in Sri Lanka, it is important to have duty of care for persons in charge of animals to treat animals humanely, as well as having strong laws for those who cause cruelty to animals, said Ms. Wijenayake. We hear stories of cruelty to animals but without a law that is robust, it is not always helpful to take legal actions against the perpetrators who behave inhumanely and in a cruel manner towards animals, she added. 
The Animal Welfare Coalition of Sri Lanka which was set up with the objective of advocating and lobbying for a new animal welfare bill consists of numerous animal welfare organisations and volunteers keen on seeing the Animal Welfare Bill enacted. The member organisations and volunteers seek to actively engage in taking action to ensure that laws on animal welfare are efficient and effective and to protect animals from being subjected to cruelty. 
It is important that the Animal Welfare Bill is enacted to ensure effective and efficient laws on cruelty to animals in Sri Lanka. The current law dates back to 1907 and lacks in deterrent effect which prevents the protection of animals against cruelty. It is time we changed these laws and made sure that the long- overdue Animal Welfare Bill is passed for efficient action against cruelty to animals, said Vositha Wijenayake.

Authorities should brief leaders on why FTA failed: Expert
	
Against the backdrop of high authorities speaking in favour of the Economic and Technology Cooperation Agreement (ETCA), an international trade practitioner said yesterday that the relevant authorities should brief the countrys leadership on the reason for the current and past market access issues, and the trade imbalance under the Free Trade Agreement (FTA) already in operation.
Former director general of commerce, P.D. Fernando told Daily Mirror that the Department of Commerce should do it.
He said all the Chambers of Commerce should cast aside their differences and unite to address the issues arising out of the FTA, in order that Sri Lankan entrepreneurs and consumers could benefit from the ECTA.
He said India was trying to narrow its trade gap with other nations, and Sri Lanka should follow suit. (Kelum Bandara)

Britains financial watchdog sends warning letter to debt firms
	
REUTERS: Firms that help people manage debt repayments are failing to make regular checks on customers and could be fined, Britains financial watchdog said yesterday.
The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) said it has sent a Dear CEO letter to the heads of debt management firms in the UK that help people struggling with several debts to consolidate repayment under a single plan.
Dear CEO letters have often been a final warning before the watchdog takes action, such as making rules stricter or fining firms.
The FCA said in the letter published on its website that it had found examples of non-compliance with its requirements for administering debt plans.
We take the failure to comply with any of these requirements seriously and non-compliance will lead us to take appropriate action, the letter from the FCAs director of retail supervision, Jonathan Davidson, said.
Such firms, usually small private companies, take the customers repayment and distribute it among those owed money. The firms must review a debt plan at least once a year and keep in touch with customers to ensure they are getting the best advice for their circumstances.
The watchdog has found that some firms have allowed the plans to run for years without a proper review, meaning a customers circumstances may have changed significantly.
Last week the Bank of England said in its twice-yearly financial stability report that household indebtedness in Britain remains high by historical standards.

China launches exchange for fast growing commercial paper market
	
REUTERS: China launched a platform for centralized commercial paper trading yesterday to promote and better regulate a 100 trillion yuan (US $14.54 trillion) market that is being increasingly tapped by small businesses to meet short-term financing needs.
The Shanghai Commercial Paper Exchange Corp Ltd, overseen by Chinas central bank, is the governments latest effort to improve its financial infrastructure, and will help consolidate a fragmented market that has seen a series of scandals in recent years.
Chinas CP market has been growing rapidly, and is playing a positive role in corporate financing and forming a multi-layer financial system, Zhou Xiaochuan, governor of the Peoples Bank of China (PBOC), said in a congratulatory note, which was read out at the
launch event.
He said the exchange will boost transparency and efficiency of the market...and help ward off risks. It will also improve the mechanism of macro-management, and improve the channel for monetary policy transmission.
Chinas commercial paper market has expanded quickly in recently years as the financial instrument, widely used in business transactions, has become an important short-term financing tool for small firms as they struggle in a slowing economy.
In 2015, commercial paper trading volume in Chinas financial system jumped 68 percent to 102.1 trillion yuan, according to central bank data. Small- and medium-sized companies accounted for two-thirds of banks acceptance bills issued that year.

Debate on COPE report will be given priority: Minister
	
State Minister of Finance Lakshman Yapa Abeywardana said the COPE report on the Treasury Bond Issue would be taken up for debate on priority basis at the very first session of Parliament in 2017 and a special fast track judicial procedure would put be put in place to conclude the legal process and punish the culprits as early as possible.
After the debate, the Speaker will send the COPE report to the Attorney General for necessary legal action.
Elaborating on a number of vital decisions taken at an extraordinary Group Meeting of the SLFP on Tuesday night chaired by President Maithripala Sirisena at his residence, Minister Abeywardana told the media at his Ministry yesterday that the bond scam had tarnished the image of the unity government, the Central Bank and the UNP beyond repair because this government came to power to do the opposite.
The unity government was formed with a firm pledge to bring corrupt politicians and officials before the law and duly punish them but not to protect them, he added.
Minister Abeywardana vowed that the SLFP was determined that under no circumstances, the SLFP would not let culprits of the infamous bond scam off the hook and punish them according to the law of the land and collect the ill gotten lucre from them.
The SLFP also decided to hold the forthcoming local government polls on the mixed and ward system and rejected totally the suggestions to hold the next election under the much corrupt and criticized old PR system.
We, the SLFP are totally against the conducting of local government polls under the old system and fully committed to hold it under the mixed First Fast the Post and PR System and Ward system that ensures the direct public representation at each and every ward in local government bodies.
Minister Abeywardana also said President Sirisena gave instructions to Local Government and Provincial Councils Minister Faizer Musthapha to make arrangements to conduct much delayed local government polls as early as possible at the group meeting.
We hope that the Asoka Peiris delimitation committee report will submit its report to Minister Musthapha before December 31. Then, Minister Musthapha is required to gazette the election under the rules and regulations recommended by the 2012 Local Government Electoral (Amendment) Act that brought the mixed voting system and ward system.
But if some one went to courts challenging the recommendations of the delimitation report, it will take time and we will not be able to hold the polls in the first quarter in 2017. But we will try our best to hold the local government polls in the first quarter in 2017, Minister Abeywardana stressed.
Minister Abeywardana pooh poohed the speculations made by Parliamentarian Udaya Gammanpila to the effect that the government was in a move to abrogate in a bid to prevent the COPE report on the bond scandal and ETCA and added the suggestion was only a wishful thinking of a politician who sought cheap publicity as he did not have points to talk about.

'Flying White House' ready to welcome Trump
	
The secrets of Air Force One has been divulged, revealing some of the amazing features that make 'the Flying White House' the most high-tech - and most luxurious - aircraft in the world.
The official presidential plane can carry more than 100 people, with space for 26 crew, as well as 76 passengers.
The plane carries two pilots, as well as a flight engineer, a navigator, and cabin crew.
It has a whole variety of rooms inside, including a conference and dining room, kitchens, and a communications suite.
At the back of the plane there is space for the press corps, with designated blue carpet, and business class seats.
Every seat is equipped with its own flat screen TV on which journalists can choose from 20 on demand films and hours of music, which they can listen to through the Bose headphones that come in every seat pocket.
The presidential suite at the front of the plane contains two twin couches, which turn into beds. The suite has blinds that come down over the portholes at the push of a button, and it was kitted out with a special Wii games console and television for when the Obama children were travelling.
There is also an attic that runs almost the entire length of the plane, packed with classified defence equipment including radar jammers and sensors to track cyber attacks or incoming heat-seeking missiles.
Air Force One usually flies in convoy with several cargo planes, containing surplus stores, and fighter jets. It also has a refuelling nozzle at the front, and the plane's ability to refuel in midair means it can stay in the skies for as long as there is food and water. (dailymail)
Trump complained about the current presidential planes as he campaigned for president, typically when he criticized President Barack Obama for flying to Hawaii in Air Force One  with its 'ageing engines' that 'spew stuff' into the environment  following remarks about carbon emissions and global warming.
Congress set aside $1.65 billion last year to cover the entire Air Force One replacement program through 2019. This year that number grew to $2.9 billion through 2021.
It is unclear where Trump's $4 billion number came from, and White House press secretary Josh Earnest disputed his numbers during a briefing with reporters aboard the current Air Force One, saying that 'some of the statistics that have been cited, shall we say, don't appear to reflect the nature of the financial agreement between Boeing and the Department of Defense'.

H'tota port sale agreement with China: NFF wants deal scrapped
	
The National Freedom Front (NFF) yesterday urged the Secretary to the Ports and Shipping Ministry to refrain from signing the agreement to sell the Hambantota Port to a Chinese company which was scheduled to be signed yesterday and warned him of the consequences, threatening that he would be the first person answerable before the FCID when a new government comes to power.
Addressing a media briefing, NFF Leader Wimal Weerawansa said the government was in a mission to sell off a valuable national resource to the China Merchants Holdings Company and added that it would directly affect the future generations of the country.
The Hambantota Port was constructed at a total expense of USD 1,691 million by the former government and the Sri Lanka Ports Authority. After signing the agreement 80 per cent of the port would be owned by the China Merchants Holdings Company and only 20 per cent of it would be owned by Sri Lanka, he added.
He said China Merchants Holdings Company had expressed intention to own the Hambantota Port on a 99 years lease by paying USD 1080 million as a down payment to Sri Lanka.
Meanwhile, he said the Ports and Shipping Minister, the port authority Chairman and the Sri Lanka Ports Authoritys Board of Directors were against this move.
Therefore, the government made their way to move ahead with this agreement with China by presenting a cabinet paper, offering the Secretary to the Ports and Shipping Ministry with the powers to sign the agreement, he added.
He said the countrys economy would also be at risk with this step and added that it would be a competitive threat to the Colombo Harbour. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)

UPFA Hambantota District MP Namal Rajapaksa today asked how the Hambantota Port, which was branded as a white elephant by the United National Party (UNP) when in the Opposition, had now become a paying concern good enough to be sold to a private company.
He condemned the Governments decision to handover some 80 per cent of the Port to China Merchants Port Holdings Company and said the government was to receive US$1.1 billion by doing so.
If the port was making a loss, the government should clarify how it was able to estimate its value at US$1.1 billion, Namal told a news conference.
He said it was uncertain as to what would happen to the funds received from the deal.
The government says it sold the port to settle the debts that had swallowed the country. However, as far as we know, it wont be used to settle the debt but will go into the hands of an individual, Namal said.
He said an income of Rs.5,000 million was received from the port during the Rajapaksa government but it had dropped to Rs.2,150 million within one year after the present government. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

About 800 kilograms of cocaine with an estimated value of Rs.12 billion was detected on board an Indian-bound vessel docked in the Colombo Harbour today following a tip off received by the Police Narcotics Bureau (PNB).

Minister, Dy. Minister argue over religious reconciliation
	
Buddha Sasana Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapaksa and Deputy Minister M L A M Hisbullah confronted each other in Parliament yesterday over the subject of religious reconciliation.
The arguments flared up when Deputy Minister Hisbullah charged that a dialogue of Muslim, Buddhist and other religious leaders initiated by the government on Tuesday had been a failure as one monk had threatened the Muslims.
Minister Rajapaksa who responded said Mr Hisbullah and other Muslim leaders who were allies of the previous regime were silent during the Aluthgama incident. It was myself and MPs such as Lakshman Kiriella who spoke on behalf of Muslims during the Aluthgama drama while you people were silent. Religious extremist groups were formed by the government in which you were an ally" Mr Rajapaksa said.
You people work for your own benefits and not for the benefit of the country" the minister added stressing that reconciliation cannot be achieved overnight. (Yohan Perera)

## Title: Muslim Women:  Second-Class Rights Holders in Sri Lankas Quazi System

Muslim Women:  Second-Class Rights Holders in Sri Lankas Quazi System
	
Despite volumes of research and recommendations for reform, Sri Lankas Muslim Marriage and Divorce Act (MMDA) of 1951 and the Quazi court system remain untouched and continue to oppress Muslim women. Muslim women face domestic violence, exploitation and child marriage and the prospect of their husbands taking multiple wives, all without means for legal recourse. Although Sri Lanka is a party to human rights treaties like CEDAW, CRC, ICESCR and ICCPR that ban discrimination against women and protect the rights of the child, Muslim women are not afforded equal protection. Article 16(1) of the 1978 Constitution allows discriminatory provisions under the MMDA to remain in effect despite inconsistencies with fundamental rights provisions. 
This article discusses the flaws of the Quazi court system from the perspective of women who have been silently suffering. I interviewed 38 Muslim women who took their cases to Quazi courts and 12 Quazis for this article. The womens stories revealed a consistent pattern of Quazi courts tolerating violence and injustice against Muslim women. The women I spoke to highlighted the following concerns: 
Quazis lack legal training. 
The MMDA allows any male Muslim of good character and position and of suitable attainment to be appointed to serve as a Quazi in a territorial jurisdiction for a specified period. Initially, Quazis were mostly older, educated individuals with standing in their communities. Today, it is not the case; those with social capital rarely seek this office and some do for recognition and power. 
Most Quazis lack formal legal training. A legal education is not required and there is no requirement for Quazis to understand the MMDA. Unlike District court judges who begin as lawyers with legal education and training under a senior lawyer and learn through experience how formal court judges dispense justice, Quazis lack training both before and after appointment. They receive only a day or two of cursory training by the Judicial Service Commission. Despite their lack of training, Quazis are usually reluctant to refer difficult cases to Magistrates Courts or to the Board of Quazis. 
The tradition of appointing lay-persons instead of lawyers as Quazis flows from the notion that Quazis serve as mediators rather than judges in informal proceedings. However, the consequence is that Muslim women are denied access to their legal remedies such as the Domestic Violence Act (DVA) of 2005. Indeed, none of the 12 Quazis I interviewed had any knowledge of the DVA. To improve the Quazi system, some community activists have suggested that only lawyers should be appointed as Quazis or that Quazis should receive adequate legal training in areas affecting the rights of Muslim women. 
Quazi courts are hostile spaces for women. 
Quazi courts are intended to function as informal, friendly and non-threatening forums for dispute resolution. In practice, however, Muslim men have used the flexible family-focused system to get away with their criminal behaviour in the private sphere. Many women described Quazi courts as extremely unfriendly spaces where women are not allowed to talk. This purported justice space is thus used to control womens private lives and conceal domestic violence. 
Quazi courts have no jurisdiction to deal with domestic violence as provided for under the DVA. However, in practice, many women seek redress for domestic violence from Quazis and when they do, are told that they invited such violence by raising in public a normal aspect of married life. In many cases, Quazis have told women to go back to their husbands, while their husbands are gently told to treat their wives well, irrespective of the severity of abuse. 
The Quazi system is male-dominated. Women are barred from holding any position of authority as Quazis, jurors, marriage registrars, or on the Board of Quazis (BOQ). There was a strong demand from many Muslim women and community activists I interviewed for women to sit as jurors and judges in the Quazi courts and BOQ. The women felt this would lead to fairer hearings and verdicts. 
Half of the women I interviewed highlighted privacy concerns with the open community court system. Men can listen in as women describe their intimate relationships and cruel and degrading treatment by their husbands. A couple of the women said that after they had discussed private issues before Quazi courts, men who listened later tried to sexually exploit them. 
Some women said their husbands stopped and blackmailed them when they tried to go to a Quazi court with complaints. Despite informing the Quazi courts about these threats, Quazis did not take any action against these men. 
Quazis delay proceedings to deny womens claims. 
If a complaint originates from a woman, especially in relation to a man taking another wife, Quazis often delay giving a verdict. Quazis postpone hearings and fail to provide maintenance settlements in writing, in effect forcing women to accept their husbands second or third marriages. In cases where women have filed for divorce, the final settlement is sometimes prolonged for many years. The cases in this study that were settled promptly were those in which men filed for divorce to marry another woman. Many women struggled to get a Fasah even against men who were known in the community to be criminals; by contrast, men accusing women of unacceptable behaviour could secure divorce (Talaq) within six months. 
Enforcement of Quazi verdicts is also a challenge. Women report that their husbands fail to make maintenance payments for many years, with Quazi courts, the Board of Quazis and Magistrates Courts ineffective in enforcing payment. Quazis lack power to enforce or monitor their rulings. Though Magistrates issue warrants to apprehend the men, police seem to ignore these cases. Women often have to find out their husbands whereabouts and inform police themselves. 
Quazis pressure women to accept their husbands conduct. 
Quazis pressure women to accept their husbandsconduct, such as a second or third marriage, rather than help the affected woman get a divorce with compensation and maintenance. Some women have been accused of not fulfilling their wifely duties (could be as trivial as not cooking on time), thereby justifying the husband marrying another woman. Quazis have told women that if they are unwilling to accept their husbands second or third marriage, they cannot ask for compensation or maintenance. The women I interviewed questioned how Quazis could be expected to challenge their husbands behavior when they themselves had multiple wives. 
Several women I interviewed said they would not seek divorce despite facing severe domestic violence and instead sought reconciliation or maintenance from the Quazi courts. Among their reasons, these women feared that if they initiated divorce, they and their children would lose the right to maintenance and compensation. When women do seek divorce, Quazis have on several occasions advised them to take Fasah, a type of divorce that disqualifies them from compensation or maintenance. 
Quazi mechanisms lack accessibility 
All districts except Killinochchi and Mullaitheevu have at least one Quazi and Puttalam has a specially appointed Quazi for the evicted Northern Muslims. Now that Northern Muslims are returning, Muslim women in Killinochchi and Mullaithivu have to travel to Vavuniya or Puttalam for Quazi court hearings. In Mannar Island, Quazi hearings are conducted only thrice a month, while in Jaffna, they are conducted fortnightly. This renders the justice system inaccessible and expensive for returnee women, who are already struggling to restart their lives. Women with children find it particularly difficult to leave their children and travel alone to Quazi courts. 
Women also face difficulty accessing the Board of Quazis (BOQ) for appeals and thus cannot remedy incorrect or unfair Quazi court rulings. Women find it difficult and cost-prohibitive to travel alone to Colombo to access the BOQ. As a result, the women I interviewed said it was mostly men who were able to use the BOQ and that they used it to drag on cases and avoid a final settlement, delay maintenance payments, and delay divorce agreements. To increase accessibility, one community leader suggested mobile BOQs to service each district every three months. Alternatively, there is a circuit sitting of the BOQ in Kalmunai to hear the appeals from the Eastern Province, which the writer feels should be extended to other districts. 
Conclusions 
Muslim women are doubly oppressed by the legal system. As has been written elsewhere, the MMDA facilitates discrimination against Muslim women. The Quazi system sharpens the blow, with Quazis lacking proper legal training or gender sensitivity to make the pronouncements that deeply impact Muslim womens lives. 
The women I interviewed felt that women in other communities had better access to relief under general Sri Lankan laws, particularly the DVA than they did in Quazi courts. They stressed that Muslim women should be given legal assistance to challenge Quazi verdicts and avail of protections under the DVA rather than be compelled to live in violent relationships and life-threatening environments. 
The women I interviewed welcome reform initiatives to the MMDA and Quazi courts that are currently being debated at the local and national levels. Their stance dispels any notion that reforms are being driven by the international community rather than by Muslim women themselves. However, as the group most-affected by the proposed reforms (and the ones that have to live with the future system), the women I spoke to demanded that Muslim women be consulted in shaping reforms. As stakeholders, they seek a system that is fair, easily accessible, efficient, procedurally flexible and sensitive to their needs. With careful reforms informed through consultations, Muslim women can finally gain equal legal status and access to justice in Sri Lanka.

Russian shares hit record high after Rosneft stake sale
	
REUTERS: Emerging market stocks climbed the most in a month yesterday, as Russias approval of the sale of a 10.5 billion euro stake in its largest oil firm sent Moscow shares to a record high and forecast-beating Chinese trade data lifted the mood.
MSCIs emerging market index jumped 1.3 percent in the wake of China reporting upbeat trade figures, with exports and imports both beating forecasts.
The European Central Bank was also expected to extend its already generous 1.5 trillion euro stimulus programme later. That could help offset some of the pressure on EM assets if U.S. interest rates rise next week
as expected.
The trade data is giving an extra boost to emerging markets today but its part of a broader trend, said Per Hammarlund, Chief Emerging Markets Strategist at SEB.
People have started to get used to (U.S. President-elect Donald) Trump being in office and the Fed hike is pretty much fully priced in... Commodity prices have continued to go up, and that sentiment is also starting to affect emerging markets.
Chinas data as well as a softer dollar in the currency markets had given most emerging Asian markets a solid lift overnight, although notably not those in China itself.
Russian rouble-denominated stocks then hit an all time high after Moscow said yesterday it sold a 10.5 billion euros (US $11.3 billion) stake in oil giant Rosneft to Qatar and commodities trader Glencore.
Not only was the money considerable, but the deal also confounded expectations that the Kremlins standoff with the West might scare off major investors from such high profile assets.

Some SLFP ministers conspiring against Govt: Mujibur
	
UNP parliamentarian Mujibur Rahuman said today there was suspicion whether some SLFP ministers with the connivance of former president Mahinda Rajapaksa were conspiring against the Government.
He said some of the SLFP Ministers were attempting stir up trouble between UNP and President Maithripala Sirisena by making controversial statements.
We have reasonable doubts whether some SLFP Ministers are conspiring against the government while others are supporting Mr. Rajapaksa while being in the opposition," Mr. Rahuman said and added that the SLFP ministers were blaming the UNP and the Prime Minister when strikes were launched.
The UNP and the SLFP joined together to form a national government not because we did not have options or the UNP is weak but we wanted to develop the country. They claimed that the UNP has an agreement with Basil Rajapaksa to divide the SLFP. We do not have any such agreement. If we wanted to divide the SLFP we could have joined some SLFPers and formed a government, he told a news conference.
Mr. Rahaman said the Government had ensured democracy, media freedom, set up independent commissions and won over the international community but some SLFP ministers were trying to destroy the initiatives taken by this government.
He challenged the SLFP ministers who were criticizing the government to leave the government and added that the Government would not be toppled even if they did so.
There is a good understanding between the President and the Prime Minister. Most of those who criticize the government were appointed through the national list. They can criticize the government within the Cabinet or at group meetings without acting in media shows, Mr. Rahaman said. (Ajith Siriwardana)
