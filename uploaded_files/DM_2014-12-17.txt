TV crew ignores the main actor
	
	
	Eco was in an ugly mood on the day the nominations for the upcoming poll were opened.
The Salalihiniya crew who called at Ecos office to cover the important event were interested only in taking a close up of every move being made by the Big Boss, totally ignoring the main actor. Even the important statement Eco made at the start of the days proceedings had not gone on the air. Fuming at this affront, Eco ordered the TV crew to remove the mike set before him saying that he was not hankering after publicity.
Later the bigwigs of the Selalihiniya station had made it up with Eco by tendering an apology for the dereliction of duty on the part of their TV crew.
