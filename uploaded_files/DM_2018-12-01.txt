A. M. A. Azeez A Scholar,  an Educationist and a Patriot
	
This is the forty-fifth year since Aboobucker Mohamed Abdul Azeez passed away. With his demise Sri Lanka lost a patriot and the Muslim community a brilliant scholar and an eminent educationist. 
Azeez is best remembered for his dedication to the development and prestige of Zahira College, Colombo - the premier educational institution of Sri Lankan Muslims. Between 1948, when he became the principal of Zahira, and 1961, when he left, Zahira not only produced successive batches of successful young men who entered the University of Ceylon and graduated as doctors, engineers, scientists and civil servants, but also became in Azeezs own words, the radiating centre of Muslim culture, thought and activities. In short, those thirteen years mark the golden age of Zahira College.

He was responsible for the administration of Zahira, but to carry out the teaching activity, he had a special talent in recruiting the best staff available in the market

He was responsible for the administration of Zahira, but to carry out the teaching activity, he had a special talent in recruiting the best staff available in the market. In the upper school, which prepared students to enter the university, Azeez by being a member of the University Senate, had the first choice to pick the brightest of graduates passing out each year. 
On Mondays, when he used to deliver his weekly address to Zahira students, one could see the galaxy of young graduate teachers standing behind him in a semicircle and digesting quietly Azeezs outpouring intellectual gourmet. His forty minutes assembly address on Mondays gave the students a mixed dose of Islamic spiritualism and secular intellectualism. Being an avid reader himself Azeez was totally dedicated to build the best college library in Colombo at Zahira. This is without any doubt, one of the permanent legacies of Azeezs principalship at Zahira.

Not many Muslim politicians understood at that time the long term ramifications of the switch from Tamil to Sinhalese as the medium of instruction in Muslim schools

In the field of education, the Muslim community was served by four leading personalities, whom I would call, the awesome foursome: M. C. Siddi Lebbe (1838-1898), Razik Fareed (1893-1984), Badiuddin Mahmud (1904-1997) and A. M. A. Azeez (1911-1973). Among them, Azeezs contribution was unique in the sense that he focused entirely on producing a class of Muslim thinkers and intellectuals, like himself, who would not only master the English language but also acquire the voluminous knowledge produced in that medium particularly on Islam and Muslim civilization. He was aware of the flood of path-breaking thoughts and research on Islam that was coming out in Western languages, and especially in English. Azeez was an Iqbalian visionary and an admirer of Muslim leaders and educationists such as Sir Seyed Ahmad Khan, Muhammad Ali Jinnah and Abul Kalam Azad. As such, he realised the crucial role that Zahira College had to play in sowing the seeds to germinate and bring forth a new generation of Muslim luminaries in Sri Lanka who would lead the community along a modernist path. To him, it was an uphill struggle given the then context of the local Muslim community which was buried in commercial pursuits and rigid religious conservatism that refused to entertain modernist thoughts on Islam and its civilization. This aspect of Azeezs life is an unwritten chapter in any of his biographies. A critical analysis of his speeches and writings would bear witness to this argument. 
With an Honours degree in history from the University of London and as the first local Muslim to successfully complete the Ceylon Civil Service Examination he started his service to his country as the Assistant Government Agent in Kalmunai in the Eastern Province between 1942 and 1944. The country was afflicted with war time shortages in food at that time. In the agricultural kill of the Karavakupattu Muslims, Azeez found the answer to solve at least part of the food problem. He took the liberty to issue land permits to those Muslims to bring barren crown lands under paddy cultivation. Even today Muslims of that area fondly remember the services of Azeez, and the area known still as Azeez Thurai Kandam is a silent testimony to his crucial role in turning that part of the country into the national rice-basket. 

His friend Abdul Cader Lebbe convinced him through correspondence that it would be too damaging for Islamic culture in Sri Lanka if Tamil were to be sacrificed in the interest of political expediency

During his short spell in Kalmunai, he came into contact with two other personalities of whom, one, Poet Abdul Cader Lebbe, a teacher serving in the same region at that time, became Azeezs lifelong ideological companion, schooled in Iqbals reconstruction of Islamic thought; and the other, Swami Vipulananda, a Hindu devotee and intellectual savant, drew Azeez further into the deep ocean of Tamil language and literature. Introduced already from a very young age by his sinna periappa (uncle) Asana Lebbe, and nurtured by the Tamil environment of Vannarpannai, the birth place of that great Tamil scholar Arumuga Navalar, Azeezs thirst for scholarship in Tamil language and literature grew even more voracious. His love and affection to that language and its importance for the Muslim community to promote and protect it became evident when he argued against the Sinhala Only Bill in the Senate. In this, he was taking a contrary path to that of other Muslim leaders in the Parliament. His approach to the language issue went beyond political populism and into long term analysis of Islams future survival in Sri Lanka. 
Not many Muslim politicians understood at that time the long term ramifications of the switch from Tamil to Sinhalese as the medium of instruction in Muslim schools. It is no exaggeration to register here that it was the intellectual arguments of Azeez and his lifelong friend Abdul Cader Lebbe that convinced even Minister Badiuddin Mahmud, who at that time was vehemently supporting that Bill. 
Azeezs contribution to Tamil and Tamil writing deserve separate research. In this respect, A. M. Nahiyas publication, Azeez and Tamil, is a valuable contribution to the memory of this brilliant mind. In the field of literature, Azeez developed a nostalgic love toward Arabic-Tamil, a unique contribution by the Tamil-speaking Muslims to both Tamil and Arabic as well as to Islam. His essay, Arapuththamil Enkal Anpuththamil yearns for a revival of this somewhat sacred dialect written in a modified Arabic script with a mixture of Tamil and Arabic vocabulary. For some time, he even wondered during the Official language controversy whether Arabic-Tamil should be an option to choose for Sri Lankan Muslims. His friend Abdul Cader Lebbe convinced him through correspondence that it would be too damaging for Islamic culture in Sri Lanka if Tamil were to be sacrificed in the interest of political expediency. 
The Young Mens Muslim Association (YMMA) and the Muslim Scholarship Fund associated with it are the twin products of Azeez and his poet friend. The idea of starting YMMA and providing financial assistance to poor but deserving Muslim students originated during their days in Kalmunai. Hundreds of bright students from different parts of the country benefited from this fund and became professionals and senior civil servants to serve their country. Surprisingly, the first YMMA branch was started in Badulla by his poet friend when he was transferred to the Muslim School there in 1943. It is an irony that the branch predated the head office in Colombo. 
The solitary palmyrah palm that Azeez planted and nurtured at the entrance of his Meadow Sweet home in Barnes Place, Colombo, constantly reminded visitors of his Jaffna heritage. Hailing from a very prestigious and highly educated family in Jaffna, Azeez was a proud product of Vaidyeshwara Vidyalayam and Jaffna Hindu College. His early education in a Hindu environment enabled him enormously to acquire not only an expertise in Tamil language but also great familiarity in Hindu philosophy and traditions. This explains why the University of Jaffna decided to award Azeez an honorary Doctorate of Letters posthumously at its first convocation in 1980.
Azeez was an institution and a walking encyclopaedia. 
His thoughts and vision were far ahead of his time. The visionary who introduced Iqbal to Sri Lanka, the educationist who produced a whole generation of English educated Muslim specialists and professionals, the public servant who rendered yeoman service to the struggling Muslim farmers in the east, the author who won recognition in national and international writers forums, and the patriot whose dedication to his country was beyond party politics is no more with us. 
It is a fitting tribute to this great intellectual and visionary that his name has been included in the 100 Great Muslim Leaders of the 20th Century, published by the Institute of Objective Studies in India. His demise was a great loss to his country and the intellectual space he has vacated will remain vacant for years to come. 
(Dr. A.C.L. Ameer Ali hails from Kattankudy and is the son of the well known poet Abdul Cader Lebbe.
He was a student of Zahira College, Colombo during the Azeez era, and graduated with Honours in Economics from the University of Ceylon in 1964. He obtained an M.Phil. Degree from the London School of Economics and Political Science and a Doctorate from University of Western Australia. He is a trained economist and has taught thousands of students in the University of Ceylon, the University of Brunei Darussalam, the University of Western Australia and Murdoch University.
His services were obtained by the South Eastern University, Sri Lanka as an academic adviser. He is now a senior academic in Murdoch University of Western Australia. He has published many research articles and presented papers at several international conferences. In Australia he is a leading personality in the Muslim community holding various positions.)

Doing battle with Saudi Arabia
	

How can Saudi Arabia be brought low If the King wont remove from power his 33-old-son, Prince Mohammad bin Salman, there may be no alternative but to do battle (non-violently) with its regime.
There seems to be no doubt that it was bin Salman who gave the order to murder Saudi Arabias dissident journalist, Jamal Khashoggi.
This is not the only reason to take up (non-violent) arms against Saudi Arabia. Others are its massive buying of Western military hardware. Another is its war in Yemen where it has killed tens of thousands of civilians. Another is that it still follows the intolerant strictures of the Wahabi sect of Islam.
In 2015, the German vice-chancellor, Sigmar Gabriel, publicly accused Saudi Arabia of financing Islamic extremism in the West and warned that it must stop. He said the Saudi regime was funding extremist mosques and communities that pose a danger to public security.

In his autobiography, Richard Dearlove, the former head of MI6, the British Secret Intelligence Service (home of James Bond), wrote that some time before 9/11, Prince Bandar bin Sultan, then the powerful Saudi ambassador in Washington, told him that The time is not far off in the Middle East when it will be literally God Help the Shiite. More than a billion Sunnis have simply had enough of them.

Thanks to Wikileaks we know that Hillary Clinton, when Secretary of State, wrote a cable in December 2009 that Saudi Arabia remains a critical financial support base for Al-Qaida, the Taliban and Lashkar-e-Taiba in Pakistan.
In his autobiography, Richard Dearlove, the former head of MI6, the British Secret Intelligence Service (home of James Bond), wrote that some time before 9/11, Prince Bandar bin Sultan, then the powerful Saudi ambassador in Washington, told him that The time is not far off in the Middle East when it will be literally God Help the Shiite. More than a billion Sunnis have simply had enough of them. Another is the evidence that it is considering developing nuclear weapons. Last week, the New York Times in a dispatch by David E. Sanger and William J. Broad asked if bin Salman was laying the groundwork for building an atomic bomb. Saudi Arabia may have arranged to buy an already-made bomb from Pakistan whose own successful nuclear weapons programme was funded in part by Saudi money. Pakistan called it the first Sunni bomb.
Whats to be done Sanctions have already been imposed by the US on 17 Saudi officials close to bin Salman. Bin Salman has been spared. Trump has made clear in public the reason for this is because Western countries need its oil and, second, the arms market is too lucrative to pass up.
The truth is that, though enormous, the sales are only a small percentage of Americas total arms production. It could be forsaken.
Oil is more problematic, but a boycott of part of its production is doable. Already, oil prices are substantially below the countrys financial needs. Its financial deficit is dangerously-high says the IMF. This is the time to hit it.
The price of oil needs to be driven down. This means other oil producers increasing the production. The first place to start is Iran whose oil industry is savaged by American sanctions. The second is Russia. Other countries that could increase their production are Nigeria, Mozambique, Angola, Ghana and Uganda. Theyll need Western help.
Western countries, with a minor increase in taxes, could reduce the consumption of oil significantly.
Would Saudi Arabia retaliate Why would it It needs income badly. It cant afford not to sell as much as it can.
Let Saudi Arabia suffer until bin Salman is sacked and brought to justice.

He said this when addressing district executive grade public servants at the Ratnapura Divisional Secretariat.
Mr. Deshapriya said the provincial council elections, the parliamentary elections and the presidential election would be completed by October 31, 2020 and pointed out that the term of office of the Election Commission would end on November 13, 2020.
Mr. Deshapriya said one of the reasons for delaying the elections to the PCs was because of the delay in finalising the delimitation committee report.

George H.W. Bush dies at 94
	
George H.W. Bush, the 41st president of the United States and the father of the 43rd, was a steadfast force on the international stage for decades, from his stint as an envoy to Beijing to his eight years as vice president and his one term as commander in chief from 1989 to 1993.
The last veteran of World War II to serve as president, he was a consummate public servant and a statesman who helped guide the nation and the world out of a four-decade Cold War that had carried the threat of nuclear annihilation.
His death, at 94 on Nov. 30 also marked the passing of an era.
Although Mr. Bush served as president three decades ago, his values and ethic seem centuries removed from todays acrid political culture. His currency of personal connection was the handwritten letter  not the social media blast.
He had a competitive nature and considerable ambition that were not easy to discern under the sheen of his New England politesse and his earnest generosity. He was capable of running hard-edge political campaigns, and took the nation to war. But his principal achievements were produced at negotiating tables.
When the word moderation becomes a dirty word, we have some soul searching to do, he wrote a friend in 1964, after losing his first bid for elective office.
Despite his grace, Mr. Bush was an easy subject for caricature. He was an honors graduate of Yale University who was often at a loss for words in public, especially when it came to talking about himself. Though he was tested in combat when he was barely out of adolescence, he was branded a wimp by those who doubted whether he had essential convictions.(WP)

Government boycotting Parliament
	
The decision made by the Mahinda Rajapaksa group in Parliament to walk out of the chamber and the announcement made thereafter that the group would not be attending Parliament till the Speaker corrects himself -- while claiming Mahinda Rajapaksa was the Prime Minister and they were the governing party in Parliament -- are unprecedented moves unheard of in any Parliamentary democracy. 
Under Article 42(2) of our Constitution, the Prime Minister and the Cabinet of Ministers have to be collectively responsible and answerable to Parliament. It is also significant that under Article 33 (A), the President is responsible to Parliament for the due exercise, performance and discharge of his powers, duties and functions under the Constitution and any written law including the law relating to public security.

In a parliamentary system, the government is answerable to the people through their representatives in Parliament

In a parliamentary system, the government is answerable to the people through their representatives in Parliament. It is the Members of Parliament who are able to check the moves of the government on behalf of the people who are sovereign under Article 3 of the Constitution. Therefore, what this move by the governing group means, is that hereafter the Prime Minister and the ministers will not be answerable to Parliament and thereby they are challenging the sovereignty of the people. 
Under Article 3, the sovereignty of Sri Lanka is in the people. Article 4 underscores the institutions through which the sovereignty of the people will be exercised and enjoyed. Under Article 4 (a), the legislative power of the people is exercised by Parliament consisting of elected representatives of the people. Therefore, Parliament is one pillar of the exercise and enjoyment of sovereignty of the people.
The opposition keeping away from Parliament does not coach much anxiety as they do not govern the country. Once the party that claims to govern the country decides to keep away from Parliament, it is a serious violation of the Constitution as the Prime Minister and the Cabinet are responsible to Parliament and this act in fact means that the government is challenging the sovereignty of the people.
To govern the country from outside Parliament is a violation of the Constitution. Breach of sovereignty of the people is an act of shifting the centre of governance out of the Constitutionally-prescribed venture of power. This is in fact the movement towards a dictatorship. They will be creating a parallel power structure if they are to carry out seriously the threat of keeping out of Parliament. The people who are sovereign under our Constitution have to rise against this move. Only mobilisation of people can bring back sanity into those who claim to be in power.

All three Nikayas have decided to advise the rulers to go for general election to elect the most suitable representatives to put an end to the current political deadlock, the Secretary General of the Asgiriya Chapter of the Shyamopali Maha Nikaya Ven.Dr. Medagama Dhammananda Thera said.
Speaking at the Sanga Samuluwa held at the Nelum Pokuna auditorium in Colombo to demand a general election in order to put an end to the current political impasse he asserted that everyone should realise that the present crisis is nothing but a conflict triggered by greed for power.
The 19th Amendment to the Constitution framed by a group identified themselves as the law experts without having any understanding about the peoples pulse targeting the Rajapaksa family has led to all these confusions, he stated.
This amendment to the constitution have been introduced to usurp the presidents power and consolidate the powers of parliament. Articles 33 ,62 and 70 have been so framed to interpret to suit the self interests of those who drafted it creating a confused situation in the country, the Thera added.
He warned that fundamentalism has crept into the politics and there are plans to defame Buddhism, grab power before February 4, discarding the Mace in parliament. The speaker has to do a main role to avert the present political uncertainty, the Thera said.
Speaking at the event Ven. Shastrapathi Ganthune Assaji Mahanayake Thera of the Amarapura Chulaganthi Nikaya said that Sri Lanka have been accepted as a Sinhala Buddhist country. Even Cardinal of Colombo and former cricketer Muttaih Muralitharan have accepted this is a Sinhala-Buddhist country, the Thera said.

Indian Coast Guard Ships visit Sri Lanka
	

Indian Coast Guard Ships CGS Samar and Aryaman are on a visit to Sri Lanka from 01 to 07 December 2018. The ships arrived in Colombo after participating in the India-Sri Lanka-Maldives Tri-Lateral Coast Guard Exercise Dosti that was conducted from 25-29 November 2018 in Maldives.
Two junior Sri Lanka Coast Guard Officers have also been embarked on the ships since their departure from India on 23 November 2018 to provide valuable sea experience and first hand insight into Coast Guard operations. During their stay in Sri Lanka, the ships would also be visiting Galle.
The visit is aimed at furthering the level of cooperation and inter-operability that exists between Coast Guards of both the nations and to assist in capacity building of Sri Lanka Coast Guard. Interaction between both the services has seen a steady increase over the years with a number of high level delegations and four ship visits undertaken by Indian Coast Guard to Sri Lanka since the last year. The operational and professional exchange that takes place between both the Coast Guards has also served to build mutual trust and provide an opportunity to learn from each other. 
CGS Samar is an indigenously designed state of the art vessel that was built in the Goa Shipyard, the same yard where Sri Lanka Navys two latest Advanced Offshore Patrol Vessels Sayurala and Sindhurala were built. The ship is designed to carry high speed boats for fast boarding operations, search and rescue, law enforcement and maritime patrol. CGS Aryaman is also an ingeniously designed vessel that was constructed at the Cochin Shipyard. Like CGS Samar she is also tasked to carry out fast boarding operations, search and rescue, law enforcement and maritime patrol.
During their visit, the Indian Coast Guard ships will undertake training on aspects such as search and rescue, vessel search procedure and documentation, pollution control etc. In addition, a series of professional exchanges and sports fixtures have been also planned ashore between the ships crew and Sri Lanka Coast Guard personnel at Colombo as well as Galle.

Israel bombs targets in south Syria
	

DAMASCUS AFP Nov30, 2018 - Israeli jets bombed several areas in southern Syria and near Damascus on Thursday drawing retaliatory fire from the ground, a monitoring group said. 
The Israeli military made no comment on the reported strikes, during which Syrian air defences opened fire for the first time since the deadly downing of a Russian transport plane in September, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. 
Israeli forces bombarded for an hour positions in the southern and southwestern suburbs of Damascus as well as in the south of Syria at the border of Quneitra province, Observatory chief Rami Abdel Rahman said. 
Syrian state media said air defences downed a number of hostile targets close to the capital.  Our air defences fired on hostile targets over the Kisweh area and downed them, the official SANA news agency reported, citing a military source. 
The Israeli military denied that any of its aircraft were hit, while not commenting on the reported strikes. 
It said a Syrian surface-to-air missile was fired in the direction of an open area of the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights but it was unclear if it had hit Israeli-held territory.

Monthly Lecture of Wildlife and Nature Protection Society Living with the Lichens
	
To be held at the Jasmine Hall, BMICH on 13th December at 6p.m.

Across the world, species, particularly species rich in ecosystems are being replaced by less complex landscapes due to human impacts in the Anthropocene. There is now a great urgency to document and conserve the biota of the world in order to establish baseline data for understanding patterns of change and resilience in the environment at both regional and global scales. Cryptogams, including lichens are more often ignored and unacknowledged, although they play a vital role in the ecosystem. 
Lichens are self-contained miniature ecosystems and behave as good farmers in the nature. It is estimated that 6% of the Earths land surface is covered by lichens. There are about 20,000 known species of lichens. Some lichens have lost the ability to reproduce sexually, but nevertheless continue to speciate.
Gothamie Weerakoon,
			Senior Curator of Lichens and Slime Moulds at the Natural History Museum of London
			Her research interests are focused on the taxonomy and ecology of tropical lichens, bio-indication and conservation of lichenised fungi in endangered habitats. Her responsibility as the Senior Curator of British, General and Historical herbaria is to manage and develop one of the worlds largest lichen collections, lichenicolous fungi and slime moulds with approx. 450,000 specimens. She has spent much time in the field in South and South East Asia observing lichens in their native habitats and described more than 75 new lichen species, mostly in Graphidaceae from the Old World tropics.
		
Lichens are found growing almost everywhere in the world from sea level to high alpine elevations, in many environmental conditions, and can grow on virtually any surface including man-made structures - glass, tiles, fibre, rubber, concrete etc. Longest living lichens recorded from Arctic and Antarctic continents which are over 3000 years old are considered to be among the oldest living organisms. 
Lichens play a vital role as bio-indicators of air pollution, ozone depletion, metal contamination and climate change since they are extremely sensitive to environmental changes. Although it goes unnoticed, many animals including humans depend on lichens - mimicry, to capture food, bedding and housing, dyes, antibiotics, perfumes, tea, flavouring agents etc. Tropical regions in the world are the hot spots for lichens. During the last 5 years over 80 new species were discovered in Sri Lanka. For lichen family Graphidaceae, Sri Lanka has been identified as the worlds hot spot. However, these fascinating organisms have not received due attention. Most of the lichens are exclusively found in specific habitats in the country and are point endemics. There is an urge to identify these organisms and conserve in their natural habitats.

Poisonous chemicals: Silent killer in Sri Lanka
	
The United Nations yesterday marked the Day of Remembrance for all victims of chemical warfare to pay tribute to them and to reaffirm. 
According to the UN, the conference of State parties at its 20th session decided that a memorial day of remembrance for all victims of chemical warfare would be observed on November 30 each year or, when appropriate, on the first day of the regular session of the conference.
The third review conference of State parties to the Chemical Convention held from April 8 to 19, 2013 at the Hague in the Netherlands, adopted by consensus a political declaration that confirms the unequivocal commitment of the State Parties to the global chemical weapons ban and a comprehensive review of the implementation of the chemical weapons convention since the last review conference in 2008. It also maps out the priorities of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) for the coming five years. 
The history of the serious efforts to achieve chemical disarmament that culminated in the conclusion of the Chemical Weapons Convention began more than a century ago, the UN says. Chemical weapons were used on a massive scale during World War I, resulting in more than 100,000 fatalities and about a million casualties.
However, chemical weapons were not used on the battleground in Europe in World War II. Following this and with the advent of the nuclear debate, several countries gradually came to the realisation that the marginal value of having chemical weapons in their arsenals was limited, while the threat posed by the availability and proliferation of such weapons made a comprehensive ban desirable.
Adopted in 1993, the Chemical Weapons Convention entered into force on April 29, 1997. It determined, for the sake of all people, to exclude completely the possibility of the use ofchemical weapons.
The UN says that today, OPCW member States represent about 98% of the global population and landmass and 98% of the worldwide chemical industry. In 2013, the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to the OPCW for its extensive efforts to eliminate chemical weapons.
In Sri Lanka, though we were devastated by a 26-year ethnic war, there were no reports or allegations of any chemical warfare. However, it is now widely accepted that imported agro-chemicals have been the silent killer in Sri Lanka.
Jathika Hela Urumaya leader Patali Champika Ranawaka -- playing a key role in the battle against the poisoning of our mother earth and even underwater ground resources by the excessive use of imported agro chemicals -- says these chemicals are now stored in the bodies of the vast majority of human beings regardless of age. They occur in the mothers milk and in the tissues of the unborn child.
In a Daily Mirror article, he says, all this has come about because of the sudden rise and prodigious growth of an industry for the production of manmade or synthetic chemicals with insecticidal properties. This industry is a child of the Second World War!
What sets the new synthetic insecticides apart is their enormous biological potency. They have immune power not merely to poison but to enter into the most vital process of the body and change them in sinister and often deadly ways. They destroy the very enzymes whose function is to protect the body from harm, they block the oxidation process from which the body receives its energy, they prevent the normal functioning of various organs and they may initiate in certain cells the slow and irreversible change that leads to malignancy - According to Rachel Carson in the book titled Silent Spring. 
Also it had been noted that selenium levels of people with the Chronic Kidney Disease of Unknown Origin (CKDu) were below the normal level and arsenic levels of their hair were higher when compared with that of healthy people inthe areas. 
Rachel Carson and her book Silent Spring paved the way for modern environment movements in the United States and to ban DDT and other related synthetic chemicals which have destroyed living beings including pests. Now this silent spring is echoing in Sri Lankas North Central Province. There prevails a deadly silence of a chronic kidney disease which has already killed hundreds of innocent poor farmers.
Thus, we hope the government will intensify its efforts to gradually reduce the use of imported chemical fertilizers, weedicides or pesticides. With the help of the media, intensive programmes need to be conducted to educate farmers on the long-term value of using organic fertilizer such as cow dung.

Speaker ready to wear jumpers
	

The hottest topic discussed, in Parliament, offices, homes and in the street, is the unruly behaviour of our politicians and especially the threat of a no-confidence motion against Speaker Karu Jayasuriya and his response -- ready to wear jumpers if he had overstepped his powers. With that picture before us, I was curious to find out the functions and duties of the clerk to the House of Representatives, as I felt that the Speaker, an ordinary Member of Parliament, elevated to the high post as Speaker should be guided and advised by some knowledgeable body, of responsibilities and conduct of the person so elected as Speaker. And that responsibility falls on the clerk to the House of Representatives. Here is what I gathered in browsing the internet -- This will be of interest to the public to judge whether our representatives in Parliament are worthy to govern. 
The office of the clerk is the legislatures secretarial services. The office of the clerk is a politically-independent organisation, providing services to Parliament, as distinct from services to the government, and providing services to members in their parliamentary role, rather than in their party or electorate capacities. Although the office of the clerks primary client group is Members of Parliament and its principal relationship is with the Speaker, with other presiding officers and with committee chairs, it also deals with office holders such as the Leader of the House, party leaders and party whips and with staff members.

The office of the clerk is a politically-independent organisation, providing services to Parliament, as distinct from services to the government, and providing services to members in their parliamentary role, rather than in their party or electorate capacities

The office of the clerk carries out the functions required under Section 3 of the Clerk to the House of Representatives Act 1988 which provides that 
The functions of the Clerk to the House of Representatives shall be:
[a] To note proceedings of the House of Representatives and any committee of the House.
[b] To carry out such duties and exercise such powers as may be conferred on the Clerk of the House of Representatives by law or by Standing Orders and practices of the House of Representatives.
[c] To act as the principal officer of the Clerk of the House of Representatives and in the capacity to manage that office efficiently, effectively and economically.
[d] To ensure that the staff of the Office of House of Representatives carry out their duties including duties imposed and;
[i] Proper standards of integrity and conduct
[ii] Concern for the public in brief
[e] To be responsible, under the directions of the Speaker of the House of Representatives for the official reporting of the proceedings of the House of Representatives and Committees.
In view of the above, it could be presumed, the Speaker would have consulted the clerk to the House of Representatives when he acted. It would have been sensible, if those creating this ugly situation, discussed the matter with the clerk, unless of course their intention was to disrupt parliamentary proceedings, giving the impression to the public that the government has no majority in Parliament.
Whatever it maybe, the public awaits anxiously the verdict of the judiciary, which will put an end to these despicable tom foolery denounced locally as well as internationally and usher in a stable government. That is the only hope.

Sri Lanka: Are we doing politics right
	
Let the clearest and the most straightforward answer be: NO, not at all! The series of recent shocking incidents that put the entire country in dismay and tarnished further the international image of this precious pearl of the Indies are most unfortunate and disgusting. The fact that this pandemonium finally raged in the very sanctuary of democracy, the Parliament of peoples representatives, is indeed cause for greater worry and anxiety. There had been many a faulty step taken by those in governing authority which ignited this national drama of chaos and disorder never seen before in the history of this beloved country. We are in plain language made into the scum of the earth and a country that has lost all self-respect whatever the great, unmatched and noble traditions may have been in our glorious past. An almost unbeatable challenge faces us as we struggle hopelessly to rise from the dust and dirt of this political scenario and national calamity. 

WHOSE RESPONSIBILITY
At whose feet should we lay this national tragedy that has overtaken and tsunamied us in total inundation It is of course national politics but one which involves both the politicians who have mismanaged the national affairs and made themselves unworthy of peoples trust but also the masses and the citizens who due to their immaturity and shortsightedness in many ways have in their fool-hardiness allowed themselves to be deceived and duped by politicians who were crafty and most noted for greed for power and self-aggrandisement. National politics is no more a noble profession of public service to the people but a wild arena where dishonest politicians look for prey and amass wealth and position. Why should people allow politics to degrade into such miserable depths and allow themselves at the same time to become purely passive pawns in this dirty game of warring factions When will the masses have leaders who can speak the truth, take care of the peoples urgent needs and govern with honesty, integrity filled with love and compassion for the people, especially for the most vulnerable and poor  those without food, clothing and shelter, the farmers, the fishermen, the daily labourers, the rural folk in the distant villages and the lower-middle class Do they genuinely open their ears to the desperate cries of the people Instead of feeding them, are they feeding on them, wasting the taxpayers money in banquets, travel and bankrupting the Parliament In which case, they are brigands and pirates and not true servants of the people!

One should not allow this pearl of the Indies to fall from the frying pan into the fire or from the brink of political anarchy into a pariah state. Sri Lanka and Sri Lankans deserve better. Our country must be forthwith redeemed from being a battleground for political greed and pursuit of power, making it instead, into an oasis of healthy and clean politics with statesman-like politicians, wise in their ways and serving the people with integrity and honesty

Unfortunately, politics continue even today in this country to provide the battleground for those vying for power and no more a hallowed space to engage in work for progress and prosperity of the people. For the last seventy years -- since the historical breakaway orchestrated by the SWRD movement -- there had been sifting sands of politics swinging from the UNP to the SLFP till the free-economy time of JRJ. Intermingling with the powers that be intruded the leftist and Marxist elements in the arena with MEP coming into the fray. The period of Dudley Senanayake was very unstable. After the economics of Free Trade and being open to foreign investment policies, we witnessed the booming through FT zones. Then came the emergence of political violence that continued into the eighties and political thuggery and marketing of politicians in the national scene. All these negative trends seriously weakened the democratic way of elections and life for the people. With the eruption of the ethnic war that lasted three long decades in Sri Lankas history, more problems and challenges were added to the countrys life. The war did a lot of damage to the country, economically, socially and internationally. Had the war not taken place, perhaps the millions that were dumped on armaments, maintaining the armed forces, their security and other needs, could have been fruitfully invested on making the economy grow in terms of uplifting the standards of living, ameliorating national health and transport and winning foreign direct investments, thus enriching the national economy, strengthening foreign reserves and raising the quality of life for the ordinary citizens. On many of these occasions, education policies could not be maintained in a consistent manner. There were also disruptions in the universities which continue almost daily, even today. Enough of blunders were made in the education sector. Skill training was at a minimum. Hundreds of university graduates were stranded in the streets in frustration owing to the lack of job opportunities. Student unions continuously agitated, thus disrupting universities and their academic programmes.

HISTORICAL ANTECEDENTS
Into the decade of nineteen-nineties intruded all the many imaginable political forms of bribery and corruption. Many politicians failed the people who elected them to their offices. There had been brazen lack of accountability, transparency, honesty and truthfulness in the way ministers went about handling their respective jobs. Although leftist and radically Marxist trends weakened, a polarization clearly marked the elections and the way governments swinged between the two major parties -- the UNP and the SLFP. Losing a two-thirds majority, which sometimes governments in power abused, major parties began entering into coalitions that proved to be very fragile. While this instability debilitated national politics, economic stagnation and war-crime charges began sending shockwaves across the nation. These two same problems are posing serious threats to the countrys future even at the moment. There is a political impasse that seems to defy any possible solution and national politics is embroiled in a huge mess that gets complicated by the hour.

The recent repeated scenes of pandemonium in the most hallowed sanctuary of democracy, the national Parliament, are symptomatic of the depth of confusion that bewilders every concerned citizen. Everyone blames the other for chaos that has tsunamied national politics. Our international image is getting further tarnished in the manner democracy is being wounded and despicably-violated by our representatives

The recent repeated scenes of pandemonium in the most hallowed sanctuary of democracy, the national Parliament, are symptomatic of the depth of confusion that bewilders every concerned citizen. Everyone blames the other for chaos that has tsunamied national politics. Our international image is getting further tarnished in the manner democracy is being wounded and despicably-violated by our representatives. There had been mayhem that held all right-thinking citizens at dismay and in a state of severe shock and utter despair. This status quo cannot continue any longer and must end immediately with right political action in accordance with parliamentary procedure and ethics. Flouting the standing orders and parliamentary procedures within these hallowed walls is a shame that has to be lamented and to be condemned unconditionally. Surely, there are other decent, gentlemanly, reasonable and democratic ways and means of resolving this crisis, clearing misunderstandings, mending differences and easing tensions than just being unruly, violent, disruptive and boorish in behaviour. Is this ethically and morally acceptable at all The answer is a clear NO, not at all!

THE WAY OUT
Proactive dialogue and goodwill require readiness to give up something of ones comfort-zones. While there is a deadlock in the arguments brought forward by both sides of the divide, there should be enough political maturity and insight to work hard together with the common interest of the good of the people of the country. No one admits of dictatorial or hegemonic actions and shortsightedness in decisions that can adversely affect the present and future of the country. What transpired last few days is by far the worst that had happened in our history, never seen before and without precedent. A calamity and a tragedy overtook us that scarred our nation defacing her of her lustre and made us the laughing-stock of the entire world. The world watches as this drama is being unfolded: politics in disarray, economy in tatters and a country in a mess. The entire episode is not fair by the people, of whom politicians are delegated representatives, thought to be trustworthy and dependable, with each one knowing what it means to represent the people and act as its servant. Politicians do not own this country and their despicably-erratic behaviour should not spoil its good name and the benevolence of its innocent and noble people. They should be responsible stewards exercising theirresponsibility consciously.

Unfortunately, politics continue even today in this country to provide the battleground for those vying for power and no more a hallowed space to engage in work for progress and prosperity of the people. For the last seventy years there had been sifting sands of politics swinging from the UNP to the SLFP till the free-economy time of JRJ

CONCLUSION
While the present status quo has to be cleaned up and those responsible for it humbly accept their mistakes, the citizens must learn their duty of electing with good judgment that their representatives should be in the seats of authority. Their imprudent and immature choices will be necessarily another unfortunate cause of ruin in national politics. It is a pity, despite decades of franchise, that our people are still so poor in their political judgment and are easily swayed emotionally and en masse by political trickery and manoeuvering. People of Sri Lanka must by now realise that they should not allow themselves to be hoodwinked into rosy political agendas of party politics. The country by now should know who rules well and for how long, the short and long term benefits they have accrued under consecutive governments. The citizens alone bear the ultimate responsibility of electing to office those who are of even-temperament, educated, upright, honest, ethically-sound and morally beyond reproach, whom they can depend on for serving the interests of their dear motherland.
One should not allow this pearl of the Indies to fall from the frying pan into the fire or from the brink of political anarchy into a pariah state. Sri Lanka and Sri Lankans deserve better. Our country must be forthwith redeemed from being a battleground for political greed and pursuit of power, making it instead, into an oasis of healthy and clean politics with statesman-like politicians, wise in their ways and serving the people with integrity and honesty. May we soon have a stable government built on the rule of law, demands of democracy and Constitutionally-established, that will augur well for the countrys peace, stability and prosperity. This is the ideal that politicians and the people at large to whom this country belongs, must strive to work for and the dream they must try to pursue.

Two Indian Coast Guard Ships to visit SL
	
Two Indian Coast Guard Ships, CGS Samar and Aryaman, would arrive in Sri Lanka on Saturday furthering the cooperation between the two Coast Guards of India and Sri Lanka, the Indian High Commission said yesterday (30).
In a statement, the High Commission said the ships would arrive in Colombo after participating in the India-Sri Lanka-Maldives Tri-Lateral Coast Guard Exercise Dosti that was conducted from November 25-29 in the Maldives.
Two junior Sri Lanka Coast Guard Officers have also been onboard the ships since their departure from India on November 23 to provide them with valuable sea experience and first hand insight into Coast Guard operations. During their stay in Sri Lanka, the ships would also be visiting Galle. The visit is aimed at furthering the level of cooperation and interoperability that exists between Coast Guards of both the nations and to assist in capacity building of the Sri Lanka Coast Guard, it said.
It said the interaction between the two coast guards has seen a steady increase over the years with a number of high level delegations and four ship visits undertaken by the Indian Coast Guard to Sri Lanka since last year.
During their visit, the Indian Coast Guard ships will undertake training on aspects such as search and rescue, vessel search procedures, documentation and pollution control.
In addition, a series of professional exchanges and sports fixtures have been also been planned ashore between the ships crew and the Sri Lanka Coast Guard personnel in Colombo and Galle as well.
