A woman and a leopard - EDITORIAL
	

ome days ago, journalist Uditha Devapriya posted on Facebook a thought-provoking post. It highlighted a disturbing realty in modern-day South Asia. His post highlighted the killing of a leopard by irate villagers in Killinochchi on 21 June, the rape of an 38-year-old woman also in Killinochchi earlier this year and the reaction which followed.
A source in the print media described the killing of that particular leopard as Mob-style leopard killing and described it as Lankas day of shame. The visual media aired live recordings of the brutal killing and interviews with wildlife figures and the dangers posed to protected species were aired via audio media. This single killing of a three-year-old majestic beast not only raised a media storm but led to such a huge public outcry that within days, a number of persons accused of involvement in the killing were in police custody. Radio interviews followed...
A weekend paper called for a crackdown on the kethi-polu wielding offenders...Yet, police statistics reveal that that between 2011 to 2016, there have been 20,542 complaints from children on sexual offences committed against them, with rape and incest dominating.
In 2011, 1,463 cases of rape and incest were reported, this figure rising to 1,904 cases in 2016. Experts say these statistics show only the tip of the iceberg. Sri Lanka police statistics show that of the total number of 1,624 rapes on women recorded in 2009, 1,228 cases related to rape on underage girls. The 2011 figures show a sharp increase in rape of underage girls. Of the total number of 1,871 rape cases recorded in 2011, 1,463 related to rape of underage girls.
Statistics provided in the new police database on violence against women and children shows Incidences of rape and incest recorded by the police have increased by 40% in the last 10 years, from 1,463 cases in 2006 to 2,036 in 2016. It is suspected, cases reported to the police are likely very low compared to the real number of incidents that occur.
The United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) estimates that one in every four women in Sri Lanka has been raped by the time she reaches 18. The UN Multi-country Study on Men and Violence found that 14.5% of Sri Lankan men had perpetrated sexual abuse at some point in their lives. 4.9% had raped in the past year. 2.7% had raped another man. 1.6% had taken part in a gang rape. 96.5% of the men who had committed rape experienced no legal consequences. 65.8% didnt feel worried or guilty afterwards. 64.9% of rapists had committed the crime more than once, and 11.1% had raped four or more girls or women - (L. P. Gordon , Violence against women)
The Sunday Times of February 25, 2018 reveals, one in four women is raped at home, while travelling or at work before they turn 18 years. Meanwhile, an Al Jazeera report quoting police statistics, show incidents of sex crimes have increased by nearly 20% in the past two years, with 4,393 cases registered during 2012-2014 as compared to 3,624 in 2010-2012.
More recently, a 38-year-old mother was raped and killed. The incident also occurred in Killinochchi. Except in the north where protests erupted, the brutal act received hardly any attention in the mainstream media... Why Oh why the deafening silence Have we like our counterparts in India lost all sense of values The killing of a beast raises a media storm, public outcry and a variety of experts and legal luminaries advising the public of the seriousness of the crime committed. But the rape and killing of a female human being passes largely unnoticed in mainstream Sri Lankan media bringing to mind the Shakespearean character Hamlets comment ...something is very wrong in the State of Denmark
Is it that the rape and killing of our mothers, daughters and sisters are so common and mundane they pass unnoticed and receive little or no attention

Availability and accessibility to quality-assured medicine is key objective: NMRA Chairman
	
Falling sick could be one of the most expensive things that could ever happen to your life. With the soaring prices of medicines, channelling fees and hospital charges, people try their best to avoid falling sick. But your immune system may not be that strong in certain instances. In terms of the prices of medicines Sri Lanka has been struggling to regulate the prices of essential medicines and streamline the importation of various drugs for the past few years. As the pharmaceutical industry went in search of more profits, its sole purpose of curing patients from ailments and illnesses took a back seat. Hence the National Medicines Regulatory Authority (NMRA) was established in 2015 by an Act of Parliament. The difference between the Cosmetic Drugs and Devices Regulatory Authority and NMRA is that the NMRA is mandated by law to look at four areas including the safety, efficacy of medicines, the need and the cost. With the reduction of prices of 48 essential medicines, the authorities took a step in the proper direction. But to what extent it has impacted patients lives remains a question.
With that in mind, the Daily Mirror spoke to Prof. Asita de Silva, Chairman of the NMRA who expressed his views about the impact of the reduction of prices, how it will be continued for 25 more essential drugs, challenges with bringing prices down and benefits to patients.
How effective was the initial reduction of prices of 48 essential medicines
Practically every regulatory authority including those in Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries regulate the prices of medicines in different ways. In the UK they regulate through a number of mechanisms. They do whats called profit capping and will show a particular profit margin after studying balance sheets. The second is that they incentivize pharmacies for using generic substitutions. My main objective is to increase the availability or accessibility to quality assured medicine. Price is a key determinant of access to medicine. In Sri Lanka, 50% of people purchase medicine out of their pocket. So whom we have targeted are people spending out of their pocket and we have regulated prices of 48 essential medicines. So the principal is essential and very commonly used medicines. These 48 medicines covered over 450 brands and the prices were regulated through a maximum retail price. By doing that we said that if there are brands with prices above the MRP their prices had to come down and all brands with prices below that cannot change. We follow some international guidelines given by the World Health Organization (WHO) when it comes to price regulation. During the 2015-2016 period, WHO experts were sanctioned to work here and study the drug market and she wrote a report titled Pharmaceutical price control in Sri Lanka. She goes on to say how corrupt the supply chain is. She also underlines the need for a major price control exercise based on retail prices. She identifies things that we knew and the argument is why we cant have a mark-up based on the Cost Insurance Freight (CIF).

Take paracetamol for example, panadol is the most widely used brand. So from Rs.3 we brought the price down to Rs.1.30. As a result, there was a 91% increase in their market share. People believe panadol is better than other drugs because it is more affordable

Why is that
According to the report, pharmaceuticals importers almost inflate the CIF. This means that we have a massively loaded CIF and the request was to give an 85% mark-up on top of that. The CIF model doesnt work in countries where this value isnt verifiable. This happens in Saudi Arabia and to do that Saudi Arabia follows the CIF plus percentage approach. But in doing that the regulator requires exhausting information. In summary they ask the factory price of the country of origin certified by that countrys regulator. They also look at the wholesale price in the country of origin. They also require the proposed CIF to the country plus the price of the product in all the countries that it is sold and these should be certified by the Saudi Embassies in those countries. It is after this process is complete that they take the CIF as real. As a result the CIF model is completely discouraged and it goes on to say that theres unethical and inappropriate drug promotion within the pharmaceutical industry which is widespread. Inappropriate drug promotion takes place in the form of rebates and discounts in the distribution chain like bonuses and sample perks. This is over and above the mark-up youre allowed to keep as a retailer. So youre leveraging the whole system by doing that. Therefore if you go back to the argument of an open market economy, the patients choice is not free. The patient is hugely leveraged by an overloaded CIF and a brand that is prescribed by the pharmacist who prescribes the brand that gives him the best deal.
Will price reduction continue for more medicines that are essential to cure diseases
We did that with 48 medicines and follow the Indian model. Our opinion based on this report is that current pricing needs to be regulated. Then we had the question of how best our approaches were. In OECD developed countries pharmaceutical cost of medicine is only 18% of their budget. In low and middle income countries this can go up to 60%. In Sri Lanka it is between 30-40% of the health budget. This shows that we spend more. We analyzed the impact of these 48 medicine prices from the last quarter of 2016 to the last quarter of 2017. Out of these 271 brands have impacted and others remain the same. In the near future we are going to price regulate 25 more medicines out of which 15 are normal medicines and 10 are cancer drugs.
Cancer drugs are known to be very expensive. Why werent they regulated before
There is a reason why cancer drugs were not regulated before. For cancer drugs the retail market is only relevant for only 5% of the population because a large majority seek treatment in the state institutions. Therefore capping retail prices in cancer drugs benefit only 5-10% of the population. We need to save money for the patients. Over this one year period the savings to people was Rs. 4.5 billion by spending less on the medicine we take. Since very few people seek cancer therapy in the private sector we didnt want to regulate retail prices since they did not impact very much. Therefore we are regulating tender prices which the government purchases. So with this new proposal the saving is to the treasury and by saving money to the treasury we believe that more patients can be given these cancer products. The cost in state institutions for cancer care medicine is about Rs. 7.1 billion rupees every year. 60% of that is spent on tenders. So our advice to the minister was to regulate the prices of tenders of these 10 products. We estimate an annual Rs. 1.7 billion saving to the government when we implement this.
What benefits do patients have with this reduction in prices
Take paracetamol for example, panadol is the most widely used brand. So from Rs.3 we brought the price down to Rs.1.30. As a result, there was a 91% increase in their market share. People believe panadol is better than other drugs because it is more affordable. This could be done only if theres competition and we encourage this competition by registering more quality-assured medicine and because the pricing is not appropriately done we have to intervene per the WHO guidelines. This is the same with stents. The National Cardiology Institute believes that for a year the number of deaths due to increased number of stenting has come down by about 3-4%. By creating a competition for the price and by lowering the tender price from Rs. 100,000 to Rs. 50,000 all people interested in going for that tender would have to compete below Rs. 50,000.
Isnt there an issue when there are more brands
Of course. The NMRA now follows strict conditions. We do a significant capping regarding the number of brands. But you may have heard that there are 100-150 brands of one drug and if you go to the market you wont be able to find the prices of more than 10 of these brands. This is completely unaccepted and unethical. Here what happens is they registered two or three brands of the same medicine and they dont bring a single tablet into the country. They hold it for tenders or they block competition because once they register the product nobody else could take it. The problem with medicine is that importation is only allowed through one local agency. In the new legislation it very clearly states that if you havent supplied the medicine for two years after getting registered, the registration will be removed. Through this mechanism we have identified so many and we would be implementing it.
How do you ensure that cheaper, lesser quality drugs are not brought into the country
Quality assurance comes by stringent evaluation internally which our regulatory pharmacists do. The second would be looking at data in other countries, post-marketing surveillance and so on. Most importantly a rigorous assessment should be made here. The third component would be quality assurance in terms of laboratories. We do that but its not good enough because the National Quality Assurance Laboratory lacks capacity. That will be our next phase where we will setup a state-of-the-art laboratory and then we will test every batch of medicine that comes into the country. Therefore we currently depend on the information that we get from outside and the stringent evaluation we do. By price regulation we are taking out a lot of drugs we believe are not quality assured. As a result, people now have access to better drugs.

Britain will not compromise over Brexit plan: May
	

LONDON REUTERS Sept 1 - British Prime Minister Theresa May said she would not compromise with Brussels over her plans for Brexit as a media report said rivals in her party were set to publish their own proposal calling for a cleaner break with the European Union. 
With under two months before Britain and the EU want to agree a deal to end over 40 years of union, May is struggling to sell what she calls her business-friendly Brexit to her own party and across a divided country. 
The EU has tentatively welcomed what has become known as the Chequers plan which is designed to protect cross-border trade, but difficult negotiations lie ahead. 
The coming months will be critical in shaping the future of our country and I am clear about my mission. The plan would keep Britain in a free trade zone with the EU for manufactured and agricultural goods. But some Brexit supporters have said that would mean parts of the British economy would still be subject to rules set in Brussels. 
Two of Mays most senior lawmakers - Boris Johnson and David Davis - quit as Foreign Secretary and Brexit Secretary respectively in July in protest at Mays plan, saying it did not go far enough and would let down the millions of people who voted to leave the EU in the 2016 referendum.

Floating, Latent and Stagnant: The Northern Predicament
	
	The people of the North and East were wedged in by war
	
	
	Unplanned mechanization of agriculture has had ripple effects
	
	
	State support for rural production also increasingly emphasizes production for cash and exports
	

For close to three decades, the people of the North and East were wedged in by war, uprooted from their lands by multiple displacements, and shut off from the market, being forced to survive on subsistence production and humanitarian subsidies. Once the war ended, they were thrown without preparation into a monetized and financialised market economy.
Economic reintegration has been fraught by exploitative loan schemes and unrealistic state or donor-led livelihood programmes. The so-called livelihoods on offer, such as raising chickens, tailoring, handicraft production and other problematic modes of self-employment have sucked the population dry with many even losing their meagre emergency assets of gold jewellery to the pawn brokers and micro-finance schemes of the financial industry.
Thanks to the protests and struggles of mainly rural women from the North and East, the severity of indebtedness has gained national attention, and the flawed character of the micro-finance model for rural development laid bare. Even so, the broader economic situation of these deprived people, their exclusion from economic opportunities, lack of regular incomes, and crippling poverty and malnutrition, remain neglected. In this article, I draw on Karl Marxs concept of a relative surplus population to analyse the economic predicament of the northern population.
Relative surplus population
In Capital Volume 1, Marx describes the predicament facing the working population as follows:
The relative surplus population exists in all kinds of forms. Every worker belongs to it during the time when he is only partially employed or wholly unemployed. Leaving aside the large-scale and periodically recurring forms that the changing phases of the industrial cycle impresses on it, so that it sometimes appears acute, in times of crisis, and sometimes chronic, in times when business is slack, we can identify three forms which it always possesses: the floating, the latent, and the stagnant.
Marx is concerned here about capitalist accumulation and its consequences, and speaks of the relative surplus population in relation to the absolute labour needs of capitalist production. Marx is addressing the economic dynamics facing the proletarian population that was pushed out of the countryside into the towns as a work force, where a section of them were spat out into becoming a stagnant and even pauperized population. In the case of northern Sri Lanka, it is the dynamics that threw a war-torn population into a neo-liberal globalized economy that has made even subsistence difficult. 
Exclusion from production
The stagnant and pauperized population in the North share certain broad characteristics. They are often landless, either absolutely landless without even housing land or lacking utilizable plots of agricultural land in the countryside. They mostly belong to oppressed caste communities and for generations have been excluded from formal employment, better avenues of education and other state services.
With labour force participation the lowest in the Northern Province, a significant section of the population in the North remains excluded from any meaningful avenues for production and income generation. In particular, women with dependants and youth lack accessible and sustainable economic opportunities.

"The stagnant and pauperized population in the North share certain broad characteristics. They are often landless, either absolutely landless without even housing land or lacking utilizable plots of agricultural land in the countryside"
For youth, employment and income generation opportunities are limited to the exploitative garment industry and seasonal wage labour. Young women who enter the newly created garment factories in the North find employment is insecure, exploitatively hard on the body and are squeezed out of the jobs before their benefits increase and mature. Youth who take up unskilled day wage labour, find that work is irregular, influenced by seasonal and weather patterns including more recently the long drought, and the whims of market demand for production.
Unplanned mechanization of agriculture has had ripple effects. Labour used in the past for harvests is no longer needed with the introduction of paddy harvesting machines. Mechanized harvesting has also undermined secondary production relating to hay including the production of cattle feed. While the investment in harvesting machines, including many bought on leasing arrangements, may not be financially feasible due to the small scale of production and leading possibly to the bankruptcy of those who purchase such expensive machinery, the nett impact is one of reducing the demand for and immobilizing of labour.

Monetisation of the economy
Even possibilities for subsistence production are limited owing to the monetization of the rural economy. Poverty-stricken households in rural Jaffna utilise as much as 15% of their incomes on purchasing firewood for cooking. In other words, there are fewer avenues for the absolute landless and those living on marginal plots of land to forage for firewood, vegetables and green leavesunlike earlier generations, their economic lives are now increasingly monetised and cash is necessary for survival.
State support for rural production also increasingly emphasizes production for cash and exports. For example, fisheries development policies focus on aquaculture production including in seaweed and sea cucumber. Such production does not contribute towards subsistence, and ends up transferring the downside risks of production disruption and market fluctuations to rural households who desperately enter these export-oriented rural development schemes. In deprived rural households devoid of subsistence, during difficult seasonal times, they do not even cook their main lunch-time meal of rice.
Capital, State and alternatives
What will become of the marginalized war-torn population of the North and East Capital exploits them and spits them out as with the garment industry and dispossesses them through financial mechanisms including pawning and micro-finance. The state also dispossess them by grabbing land and coastal resources for its mega development projects and environmental conservation programmes of the Forest and Wildlife Departments as well as by pushing people into unsustainable self-employment and livelihood schemes. Pauperized or on the brink of poverty, state and donor schemes such as for poverty alleviation pull them up a notch for a period of time, keeping the population in the painful dynamics of floating, latent and stagnant economic life.

	The war-torn population, inevitably requires local and rural economic alternatives
	
	
	The stagnant and pauperized population in the North share certain broad characteristics
	
The marginalized war-torn population, inevitably requires local and rural economic alternatives. Land for the landless, and the strengthening of communities through the redistribution and granting of land is one such avenue as their pauperisation is directly linked to landlessness. Strengthening producer co-operatives including in fisheries, livestock, crafts such as carpentry and palmyrah-related production is another avenue to strengthen communities of producers and the incomes they earn.
Avenues for regular incomes, including through re-distributive schemes that also contribute to local rebuilding, such as the National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme in India where each household was guaranteed one hundred days of rural work every year, is another possibility. However, the search for such alternatives require recognition of the crippling economic reality facing a section of our citizenry and listening carefully to their long ignored struggles.

Friends and family claim Sydney terror suspect was framed
	
Friends and family of 25-year-old Kamar Nizamdeen, who was arrested by the New South Wales Police on Thursday for alleged terrorism charges, claimed that Nizamdeen was framed.
"He was an open minded Muslim who has been framed by someone with immense jealousy in heart. Jealousy on his accolades, his position and the type of character he has developed, his 19-year-old brother said in a posting that is being circulated on Social Media.
Another friend, Shehan Bhavan posting on Facebook questioned as to the credibility of the evidence against him.
"Why would an IT savvy person like him have a notebook full of places in Sydney he is being framed for his name," he said.
Another friend posted "Absolutely unbelievable that this is happening to the Kamer we know and love" before adding sympathy toward the family.
Nizamdeen, a Phd student at the University of New South Wales and an alumnus of the St.Thomas College, Preparatory School, Kollupitiya and Asian International School (AIS), was arrested by the New South Wales Police after it had received a tip-off from a colleague regarding a notebook containing symbolic places on Thursday.
A former teacher of Kamer, Tania Bartlett told the Daily Mirror that it was " unthinkable" that he would be aligned to such ideology or activity he is suspected of.
" Kamer as I know him could never be capable of such depravity. He is a clever, kind and sensitive and is a fun-loving, food loving boy just as most boys his age and so this is simply unthinkable by me and other teachers, students who know him, have stayed in touch with him. We all pray that the investigation will be thorough and that he will be cleared of all this" she said.
He was not granted bail with the next hearing set for October 23rd. It is unclear as if he were granted legal representation during the hearing. Media reports said that Nizamdeen had not sought bail.
The brother of Nizamdeen, explaining the statements of the Police reported in the media, said that there was an attempt to mystify the public with vague statements.
"When the media tells you that he travelled to Sri Lanka and other areas please understand that other areas are not Syria or any war torn region in the Middle East. It is simply the United States of America where he travelled to visit family. When they tell you that they raided his apartment and found Electronic Gadgets please note that they are referring to a Phone, Laptop and an Xbox, he said.
In a final plea to the suspected framer, Junior Nizamdeen urged that they come forward and tell the truth.
"To he who has done this and framed my brother I sincerely cannot speak for my parents but I can forgive you. I hope you look deeply into your heart and feel guilt in your horrendous crime. I hope you can find God and that you can have sincere repentance and come out and tell the truth," he said.
The NSW Police earlier allegedly found documents 'containing plans to facilitate terrorism attacks' and a notebook that named a number of locations and individuals as 'potential targets'.
'From the documentation, we believe he would affiliate with ISIS,' Detective Superintendent Mick Sheehy told the media hours after the arrest.
Australian Federal Police detective superintendent Michael McTiernan said the charges laid against Nizamdeen were 'serious and significant'.
At this stage there is a number of locations and individuals named in that document who are potential targets, he told reporters on Friday.
However, Bhavan insisted that something remained amiss in the entire saga.
"I know he never believed in any of the crap he is being accused for simply finding a notebook of places," he said going on to state "our best guess is he uncovered something while working with the Government and now he is being framed for it".
The brother of Nizamdeen also extolled the same sentiments.
"He has been falsely accused and as justification of having no conclusive evidence, their motive is to prolong his stay under custody to simply save themselves," the post being circulated on social media said. (Hafeel Farisz)

Indias SpiceJet successfully completes maiden biofuel flight
	

India, (rt.com), 2 September 2018 -Budget carrier SpiceJet has successfully tested Indias first flight powered by biojet fuel. The flight from Dehradun to the nations capital lasted almost 45 minutes, and was made using a Bombardier Q400 aircraft.
Around 20 people, including officials from aviation regulator DGCA and SpiceJet, participated in the test flight.
According to the company, the flight was powered by a blend of 75-percent air turbine fuel (ATF) and 25-percent biojet fuel. Made from Jatropha crop, the fuel has been developed by the Indian Institute of Petroleum (IIP).
SpiceJet explained that the advantage of using biojet fuel instead of aviation turbine fuel (ATF) is that it reduces carbon emissions and enhances fuel efficiency.
According to global airlines body IATA, the aviation industry accounts for two percent of the total global greenhouse gas emissions. It has set a target for one billion passengers to fly on aircraft using a mix of clean energy and fossil fuels by 2025.

Janabalaya Kolambata will be peaceful: Namal
	
The 'Janabalaya Kolambata', protest march organized by the Joint Opposition (JO) scheduled to be held on Wednesday (5) in Colombo, would be carried out in a peaceful way, MP Namal Rajapaksa said today.
Addressing a news briefing, he said the protest march had been organized in a way that no harm would be caused neither by the general public nor to public property.
The Government is spreading rumours that the JO protest would bring inconvenience and trouble to the general public. It is obvious that the Government is scared of this protest because they know that this protest march would become a challenge to the Government, the MP said.
"Thats why they are in a move to sabotage this protest march, the MP added.
He said the protest campaign mainly aimed at toppling the Government and pressing it to go for the General Election.
Meanwhile, MP Kanchana Wijesekera said that anybody could join hands with them irrespective of party affiliations.
This is a protest for all those who are against this Government and aspiring to have a new Government. Hence, there is no restriction or barrier to joining in this protest, MP Wijesekera said. (Sheain Fernandopulle)

Obama, Bush rebuke absent Trump in McCain tribute
	

REUTERS, 02nd SEPTEMBER, 2018-Former U.S. presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush, once rivals of the late Senator John McCain, praised him in eulogies on Saturday and joined his daughter at a memorial service in subtle and not-so-subtle rebukes of President Donald Trump.
Without naming Trump, who did not attend the service, Meghan McCain condemned the president in remarks that at times drew applause and came after she said her dad told her to show them how tough you are with her eulogy.
We gather here to mourn the passing of American greatness, the real thing, not cheap rhetoric from men who will never come near the sacrifice he gave so willingly, nor the opportunistic appropriation of those who live lives of comfort and privilege while he suffered and served, she said, speaking forcefully and, at times, through tears.

Sampanthan seeks meeting with Wiggy
	
Amidst speculations about a possible split of the Tamil National Alliance (TNA), its leader R. Sampanthan has sought an immediate meeting with Northern Province Chief Minister C.V. Wigneswaran on September 7 apparently to explore the possibility of patching up differences, it is learnt.
There have been open confrontations between Mr. Wigneswaran and TNA MP for the Jaffna district M.A. Sumanthiran giving credence to speculation that the TNA might break up ahead of the elections to the Northern Provincial Council.
Against the backdrop, Mr. Wigneswaran, at a meeting with the Tamil Peoples Council (TPC), articulated that he had four options in the event of the TNA not giving him nomination - to retire from politics, to join another party, to form his own party or to join an organization like the TPC.
The TPC, a body of Tamil civil society movements, said it would not allow Mr. Wigneswaran to retire from politics.
Asked whether a party would be formed, Mr. Wigneswaran told Daily Mirror that he had not thought of starting a new party immediately.
It is not an easy thing to start a new party at my age. These are discussions that are going on, he said.
However, he said Mr. Sampanthan sought a meeting with him to discuss the latest developments.
Maybe, Sampanthan will ask me not to start a new party but to stay with his party. We do not know, he said.
Asked whether some external forces such as India wanted the TNA to remain united, Mr. Wigneswaran replied, That may be true. I was not consulted, nor was anything said to me. But, that may be true. They may want unity among these people. It all depends on how people are cheated,
He also said, I have nothing to hide. My position is that we had come to power seeking Federalism. Federalism is what we have asked for. If it is to be changed, we must go back to our people and get their consent. (Kelum Bandara)

September 8 is World Physical Therapy Day: Keeping mental health in a busy society
	

World Physical Therapy Day takes place every year on 8th September. The day is an opportunity for physical therapists from all over the world to raise awareness about the crucial contribution the profession makes to keeping people well, mobile and independent.
The campaign message of World Physical Therapy Day 2018 is Physical therapy and mental health, demonstrating the role that physical therapy and physical activity have on mental health.
According to the WHO, There were close to 800, 000 suicides worldwide in 2016. This indicates an annual global age-standardized suicide rate of 10.5 per 100, 000 population.
The major differences between high-income countries and low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) are that young adults and elderly women in LMICs have much higher suicide rates than their counterparts in high-income countries, while middle-aged men in high-income countries have much higher suicide rates than middle-aged men in LMICs.
800, 000 persons approximately die from suicide globally each year (one death every 40 seconds) 2.8%was the median number of the health budget allocated to mental health in 2011 60 countries had less than 1 psychiatrist per 100 000 population in 2014
World Confederation for Physical Therapy (WCPT) is the sole international voice for physical therapy, representing more than 350,000 physical therapists worldwide through its 106 member organizations.
Sri Lanka is also a member of the WCPT since 2003. In 1996, WCPT designated 8th September as World Physiotherapy Day.
This is the date WCPT was founded in 1951. The day marks the unity and solidarity of the global physiotherapy community. It is an opportunity to recognize the work that physiotherapists do for their patients and community.
WCPT encourages physical therapists around the world to use WCPTs toolkit to convey these messages to the public and policymakers.

The campaign is focused around the following key messages.
	Exercise as an evidence-based treatment for depression.
	The role of physical therapists working with patients who may have mental health issues.
	The benefits of physical activity in protecting against the emergence of depression.
	How better outcomes are experienced when exercise is delivered by a qualified healthcare professional, such as a physical therapist.
	How people with mental health issues are more at risk of having poor physical health.
These messages are important not just to encourage health and activity in populations. They can help demonstrate how physical therapists keep people moving through interventions which maximize strength and mobility. Through advice and exercise programmes, physical therapists support people of all ages to achieve activity goals.
Since 2003 we have commemorated the World Physical Therapy Day with various programmes. Using World Physiotherapy Day as a focus, this year also the Charted Society of Physiotherapy Sri Lanka (CSPSL) aims to organize several programmes to promote the profession among the nation and advance the use of profession by the public.
However, we have experienced that there is a gap in public awareness of the majority of the public. Therefore we have decided to improve the public awareness programmes about the physiotherapy profession.
In 2017 to mark the World Physical Therapy Day, the Chartered Society of Physiotherapy (Sri Lanka) conducted a series of events. The objective of this programme was to enhance the awareness of the public about prevention and the pre- and post-management of physical fitness when dealing with diseases, injuries and complications, assuring the well-being of life. The programme consisted of five free physiotherapy clinics, four public awareness workshops and two sports injury management workshops. More than a thousand individuals, including patients, benefited from the programme.
Wide coverage was also given to the events in the media, including twelve television interviews.
With the guidance and contribution of 22 physiotherapists representing CSP (SL), the final day of the programme was held the day before World Physical Therapy Day on 7th September in Thelkumuduwala, a rural village in Sri Lanka. Free clinical and awareness events were offered, demonstrating the sense of value and importance of the physical therapy to the hearts of the public.
In view of marking the World Physiotherapy Day, Physio Lifecare (Sri Lanka) conducted a series of events.

	In view of Physiotherapy Day, Physio Lifecare (SL) conducted a series of events
	
	
	This series includes coverage on six media (television) channels
	
	
	The final day of the programme will be held on September 6
	
The programme focused on this years Physical Activity for Life message and raising public awareness of the importance of physical fitness. Two free physiotherapy clinics were carried out, along with fifteen exercise workshops, three public awareness workshops and five sports injury management workshops serving more than ten thousand individuals including patients.
This series includes coverage on six media (television) channels.
The final day of the programme will be held on September 6 in Pannala, a rural village in Sri Lanka offering free exercise workshops and awareness events, as well as a television programme on national television (ITN) Sri Lanka.
An inter-school quiz competition was organised to celebrate World Physical Therapy Day on 8th September. It was organised by the Physiotherapy Students Welfare Society, Department of Allied Health Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, the University of Colombo.
We have identified that inclusion of the September 8, as the World Physical Therapy Day into the appropriate documents such as calendars, diaries, year planners etc. would be greatly useful to improve the public awareness.

SLs next best tourist destination: Ella has over 100 unlicensed liquor dens
	
One of Sri Lankas most renowned tourist attractions set in the cold climes is Ella. This area sadly is fast becoming a town of lawlessness where at least 100 places had been identified as those selling liquor and alcoholic beverages without licenses, the Excise Department disclosed.
A place where no season is applied compared to other popular tourist destinations around the country like Unawatuna, Hikkaduwa, Arugam Bay or Pasikudah, Ella has grown to be an all-season tourist attraction that is visited by thousands of foreigners annually.
A large number of attractive lodging facilities had emerged lately to accommodate the growing number of tourists not to mention the mushrooming liquor outlets to quench the thirst of the adventurous visitors that flock there every day.
The Excise Department had identified over 100 restaurants, bars, clubs and hotels that sell liquor but without a valid license to do so.
A senior Excise official told the Daily Mirror that only eight licensed premises operate in the Ella Town, whereas over 80% of the lodging facilities sell liquor sans a mandatory Excise license.
A series of raids were carried out two weeks ago by the Excise Departments Bureau of Special Operations (BSO) flying squad where a number of such places were raided and over 1, 000 bottles of liquor seized.
The situation however, had become worse when the same unit visited the town last Poya (August 25) where five places selling liquor without a license were raided.
On a day when all licensed liquor premises remained closed due to it being Poya, several teams of Excise BSO flying squad got the opportunity to only nab five offenders, five unlicensed places simultaneously within an half an hour, as numerous other places immediately shut down as the news of the arrival of the Excise sleuths spread like a wildfire in the town.
The Excise officials managed to seize 520 beer and wine bottles including foreign liquor from the places that were raided and took five individuals into custody.
It was reported that as these raids were being conducted a local government politician had intervened and asked the Excise sleuths to turn back saying that the Prime Minister had ordered them not to disrupt the way of life of owners of such establishments in Ella.
A large number of representatives of these unlawful liquor selling places had requested for an appointment with Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe recently to discuss the plight they were in and were summoned along with senior Excise officials for an open discussion.
When the Excise Commissioner General expressed the departments inability to let any party sell alcoholic beverages without a valid Excise License under the prevailing law of the country, it was reported Premier Wickremesinghe had asked them to make necessary arrangements to issue these sellers with an appropriate license to legalize their trade, the sources said.
However, the trend seems to be that such sellers prefer to remain unlicensed concerning fewer penalties and other hassles when compared to many legal implications they would have face if they receive a license.
According to sources, when an unlicensed premises is fined a maximum of Rs.125, 000 by the Magistrates Courts in the area for selling liquor without a license whereas the penalties for licensed premises committing the same offence would be much more and could even go up to Rs.500, 000 for simply violating the license conditions.
Apart from the hassles of bookkeeping and other legal formalities, many such sellers prefer to be unlicensed as they do not have to pay taxes to the state from their unaccounted wealth, the sources said.(Kurulu Koojana Kariyakarawana)

Sri Lanka Police celebrates 152 years today: A dignified and enduring mission
	

On this day, the 152nd Police Day is celebrated, under the theme, A Dignified Enduring Mission with the objective of making Sri Lanka Police, which closely associated with Sri Lankan community for a period of 152 years, the bosom companion of the public with the help of community policing concept.
ature has endowed the human beings with a higher cognitive capacity, which surpasses that of all other living beings, probably as a means of ensuring the existence of the world.
Thus, we are born into this world and lead our lives as social beings. Concerning our lifespan from womb to tomb, and even further in case of illegitimate conceptions or illegal exhumations, Sri Lanka Police is entrusted with the bounden duty of shouldering the constitutional responsibility and ensuring the safety of the general public of our motherland.
Adopting the Buddhist words of wisdom, Dhammo hawe rakkhathi dhammachari (One who lives with the Dhamma is protected by the Dhamma) as its motto, while wearing the emblem bearing a dauntless tusker in the middle and the dharma chakra (Dharma Wheel) on the head, Sri Lanka Police is dedicated towards maintaining law and order while safeguarding lives and property of all Sri Lankans.
This is considered to be one of the major organizations among the three State institutions, which were initially established in this country and its glorious history and the 152nd anniversary is thus celebrated with great vim and gusto.
Sri Lanka Police also marks the inception of the first security service in Sri Lanka. The history of the security service of this country goes back to the reign of King Pandukabhaya and this service owes its origin to the position named, Nagara Guththika. It has gradually evolved up to the Dutch and Portuguese eras. After occupying the maritime areas of the country in 1796, the British established a Police Service in this country.
The Police Force was further streamlined under the regulations imposed by the Act bearing No. 14 passed under the British Crown in 1806 and at the time the Police Force consisted of 28 Police Force Constables.

"This is considered to be one of the major organizations among the three State institutions, which were initially established in this country and its glorious history and the 152nd anniversary is thus celebrated with great vim and gusto"
Payment of salaries to the Police Force was made with effect from July 9, 1833.
Then, 47 Police Stations were established centred on commercial cities and 585 Police Officers were deployed for city protection duties.
The Maradana Police Station was recorded in history as the First Police Station to be established in this manner.
With the appointment of Mr George William Robinson Campbell as the first Inspector General of Police on September 3, 1966, as per the provisions of the Police Ordinance No. 16 of 1865, the inauguration of the Police Service as an organization in this country took place Constitutionally.
The said date has been declared as the Police Day. Since the appointment of Sir Richard Aluvihare on January 6, 1947, as the first Sri Lankan Inspector General of Police, the occidental aura emanated from the Police Service has begun to be overpowered by the Sri Lankan spirit.
At present, Sri Lanka Police functions under the Ministry of Public Administration and Law & Order and has become a solid Government institution, which consists of 64 Functional Divisions, 42 Territorial Divisions, 491 Police Stations with a strength of more than 90,000 Police Officers.
The term Polis has been derived from the French language and it means, The guardian of the civil administration.
There is no other public institution than Police organization, which faces greater challenges in a country, where the civil administration is in effect due to the absence of internal disputes.
The Sri Lanka Police, which has encountered three internal civil disputes, has faced many daunting challenges subsequent to the war situation prevailed for three decades in North Eastern Provinces.
The duties of a Police organization in other countries are investigation of crimes, crime prevention, maintenance of law and order and traffic management.
However, the professional role of a Sri Lankan Police officer is played in a more complex way.
In addition to the basic police duties such as crime investigation, crime prevention, maintenance of law and order and traffic management, the citizens of the country currently expect the police to perform tasks such as implementing laws on liquor and narcotics, prevention of communicable diseases like dengue, protection of forests, coastal conservation, wildlife conservation, prevention of illegal sand mining and illegal excavation, even though there are separate Government bodies which are functioning to implement such environmental laws.
At present, even the safety of the railway crossings is ensured under Police supervision. Thus, the duty of the police officer has become extremely complex.
On the other hand, it brings us great pleasure to think of the sense of confidence Sri Lanka Police has inspired in the Executive, the Legislature and the general public for choosing us to assign a significant share of all these tasks.
In other countries, usually, the Police officers are not assigned to other duties.
However, the Sri Lankan Police are deployed for the performance of other duties and a different structure has been designed for that purpose. The officers of Sri Lanka Police are discharging those duties on a daily basis and sometimes even the officers of the Special Task Force, which is the elite paramilitary forces unit of Sri Lanka Police, might assume the role of a valiant soldier, while discharging ordinary Police duties.
Sri Lanka Police that has inherited a proud history of 152 years, is offering many services covering various fields to more than twenty million Sri Lankans.
Protecting lives and property of Sri Lankan citizens, Sri Lanka Police have presently become a bosom friend of the general public and it stands upright like a giant tree above a thick canopy of praise, blame, commendation and criticism while confronting all the difficulties and challenges around the clock in both sun and rain.
The number of Police Stations that was 437 in 2015 have been increased up to 492 to date by the present Inspector General of Police, Mr Pujith Jayasundara, who pays special attention towards improving the basic facilities and service facilities necessary to fulfil the public needs efficiently by bridging the gap between the public and police.
This provided a great relief for the people who had to travel a long way with great difficulty to get services from Police.
New Police Stations have been established by further segmenting some of the larger Police Divisions.
This has further reduced the population density of a respective Police Station and therefore those people have been able to get their services more efficiently.
Furthermore, taking measures to develop human and physical resources in Sri Lanka Police with the intention of ensuring the security of the society in a peaceful country can be perceived as a huge achievement of the citizens of this country.
This becomes evident when analyzing statistical data of 15 years in which the tendency to talk about criminal incidents have increased. Criminal incidents were also reported during the years 2007, 2008 and 2009 when compared to the present.
However, since news articles on war had occupied more space on newspapers, incidents of crimes did not attract much public attention then.
After 2009, headlines related to war had been replaced with headlines about criminal incidents, creating a basis for discussion. That is not a factor which should be construed as an increase in crimes.

"The number of Police Stations that was 437 in 2015 have been increased up to 492 to date by the present Inspector General of Police, Mr Pujith Jayasundara, who pays special attention towards improving the basic facilities and service facilities necessary to fulfil the public needs efficiently by bridging the gap between the public and police"
Through the application of modern technology for investigating crimes, Sri Lanka Police has been able to initiate a significant development in the field of investigation.
A great assistance is being given by Scene of Crime Officers (SOCO) who have undergone a proper training, officers and hounds of Police Kennels Division, Fingerprint Officers and Photographers of Police Criminal Records Division to facilitate the investigations and to identify criminals.
At a time when the entire world is shrinking into a small global village, even the criminals in our country have gained access to the modern technology under globalization and show a tendency to employ modern technology and communication methods to commit crimes.
Confronted with the challenge of protecting people from those who commit organized crimes, while being members of crime networks, Criminal Investigations Department is taking measures to shoulder their responsibility and all Police Stations of the Island are also extending a great support in that regard.
May Sri Lanka Police endure through time executing its legendary mission!

State obligation with regard to torture, and failed governance
	

A meeting held by the Kandy Regional Office of the Human Rights Commission in support of victims of torture on June 29, 2018 raised concerns again with regard to impunity of the police, and failures of the legal system.
The programme at the meeting provided an opportunity for a woman torture victim from Mahiyangana to recount her experience in a public forum. She alleged that she and her son had been tortured by officers of the Mahiyangana police. She claimed that this followed prolonged harassment from 2006 to 2017, because she refused to sell a piece of land she owned, to a senior police officer who wanted it for sand mining.

"Allegations of torture by police are not uncommon. What is a matter of grave concern is the failure of successive governments to respond"
She also detailed the manner in which court procedures were abused to harass and intimidate her. She alleged that the Magistrate of the area, who is the spouse of a police officer, was responsible for this abuse of legal procedures and harassment, including arrest and prosecution.
She disclosed that frequent complaints to the Police Commission, the Attorney Generals Department and the senior officers of the Badulla Police failed to elicit any response. Her case will now come before the Human Rights Commission for inquiry in November 2018.
Allegations of torture by police are not uncommon. What is a matter of grave concern is the failure of successive governments to respond. The fact that this harassment is alleged to have occurred from 2006 under a previous regime, demonstrates the continuing failures in law enforcement and the phenomenon of abuse of authority with impunity.
Our Constitution, and legislation from 1994, prohibit the use of torture by the State and its officials. The Supreme Court has developed jurisprudence that clarifies the responsibility of the State and the rights of citizens.
There are legal provisions in an Act passed by Parliament in 1994 that demand prosecution of perpetrators. Yet the communication issued after this programme of the Human Rights office in Kandy, calls upon the government to reactivate the law. Does this mean that the government has adopted a policy of not enforcing the law on torture
The Friday Forum calls upon the government to clarify the current policy on this matter, and inform the public what has been done to implement earlier recommendations of the Human Rights Commission, responding to torture. We call on the government and all relevant authorities to ensure protection for the person who made these allegations at the programme organized by the HRC, pending any investigation, and afterwards too.

"She alleged that the Magistrate of the area, who is the spouse of a police officer, was responsible for this abuse of legal procedures and harassment, including arrest and prosecution"
The AGs Dept. the Police Commission and the IGP have a duty to network with each other and indicate what is being done to respond to allegations made in the Mahiyangana case. We trust that the Judicial Services Commission will inquire without delay into the allegations against the Magistrate. Professional associations like the Judicial Officers Association and the Bar Association have a duty to respond and engage proactively with the issue of preventing ineffective law enforcement and abuse of legal procedures, particularly in remote jurisdictions. This governments failures in law enforcement are constantly cited as a justification for strong, effective and authoritarian governance. Yet we must also not forget the lessons of history, which reveal that failed democracy and its replacement by authoritarian governance will expose everyone, including the present rulers, to the type of experience highlighted in the Mahiyangana case. Responding to the problem is a responsibility of the State, and of all citizens who recognize the dangers inherent in abuse of power and authority.
The Friday Forum is an informal and self-financed group dedicated to democracy, good governance, human rights and the rule of law. We work on a non-partisan basis and have been critical of both the Government and Opposition.
Friday Forum is comprised of well-known academics and social activists including Dr. Geedreck Usvatte-aratchi, Tissa Jayatilaka, Faiz-ur Rahman, Prof. Gameela Samarasinghe, Prof. Ranjini Obeyesekere, Prof. Camena Guneratne, Chandra Jayaratne, Rev.

The 'dumb' beggar spoke and his charade ended
	
A beggar, who pretended to be dumb, suddenly screaming blue murder when a dog tried to bite him took everyone by surprise. The incident was reported from the Aniwatta area in Kandy.
A beggar came up with a way, which thought to be clever, pretending to be dumb with the hope that people would feel sorry for him and give him money. He went up to many affluent households and begged for money using sign language to show that he was unable to speak.
His method was quite successful and many felt sorry and offered him money and food. However, his luck changed in dramatic fashion when one day while he was going through his usual begging routine a ferocious dog got loose and chased him causing him to let out a shout for help saying "Budu ammo mawa beraganin". He then climbed a tree in order to get away from the chasing dog. The dog was not able to get hold of him but managed to rip his sarong off.
It was then that he realised the consequences of what he had just done because his charade was now known to all those who witnessed the incident. That was the last the public saw of the 'dumb' beggar who must have known his time was up and that he would not be able to fool any more people in the future. (Dhammika Gunawardena)
