AG should expose truth behind bond scam: SLPP
	
The Attorney General (AG) should expose the individuals responsible for the Central Bank bond scam, the lawyers' body affiliated to the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) said today.
?The AG has a legal obligation to expose those responsible and take steps to punish those found guilty,? SLPP General Secretary Sagara Kariyawasam told a news conference.
?On June 1, 2015 Crime Investigation Division (CID) Director B.R.S.R. Nagahamulla informed the Attorney General?s Department of a possible financial fraud that had taken place involving a company called Perpetual Treasuries (pvt) Ltd. and the Central Bank (CB). Thereafter the AG?s Department was said to have opened a file to investigate the matter,? he said.
He said the report had been sent to the Criminal and Civil Deputy Solicitor Generals by the AG, who in turn recommended that immediate action be taken against the parties involved.
?Both Deputy Solicitor Generals were of the opinion that the bond issue should be investigated further. However, their recommendations were ignored and no investigation followed. The AG should not stay silent any longer and should order a thorough investigation into the matter,? Kariyawasam said.
Meanwhile, he said that the people of the country need to know the truth about the bond issue and under the Right To Information (RTI) Act the AG is duty bound to reveal to the people what really took place.(Thilanka Kanakarathna)

CJ in Lahore: Legislation should benefit masses
	
Chief Justice K. Sripavan yesterday underlined the need for legislation that could directly benefit the masses and all those approaching the courts in search of justice.
Addressing the SAARC Law Conference in Karachchi, Pakistan, he agreed with his counterpart from Pakistan that both Bar and the bench must play their role for the cause.
?SAARC countries must make concerted efforts in this regard,? he said.
Justice Sripavan said that supremacy of law was a prerequisite for the prosperity and healthy growth of any society.
Meanwhile, Chief Justice of Pakistan Mian Saqib Nisar said the Judiciary had Constitutional Rights to prevent administration from misusing its powers.
The CJP said it was incumbent upon the Judiciary to protect the fundamental Rights of people in general.
He particularly referred to the Suo Motu (on its own motion) notice taken recently by the Supreme Court about the plight of the child Tayyaba.
Senior advocate of Supreme Court of India, K.K. Venugopal, the keynote speaker, made his presentation titled ?Poverty ? An Alarming Violation of Human Rights.?
He said that the test of progress for any country was not that it had added to the abundance of those who already had much, but whether the country could provide to those who had too little. ?
The event concluded with a discussion on success and failure in the SAARC.

MR would?ve retired gracefully if he didn?t amend the constitution: PM
	
Responding to a statement made by former President Mahinda Rajapaksa that President Maithripala Sirisena brought him back to politics, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinge?on Saturday?said that Mr Rajapaksa would have gracefully retired after two terms if he did not amend the constitution enabling him to go for another term.
Prime minister made this remark at rally organized by the UNP in Anurhapura on Saturday.
"Former President had said that President Siriaena brought him back to politics after retirement. I don't want to talk about SLFP but would like to say that late President J R Jayewardene in his constitution limited the number of terms a president could hold to two. Accordingly he retired after serving two terms. President Wijetunge retired after serving one term and President Chandrika Kumaratunga retired after two terms. However, President Rajapaksa amended the constitution and decided to go for a third term. He would have retired gracefully without getting defeated if he did not run for a third term." the Prime minister said.(Yohan Perera)

Sumanthiran assassination plot a sign of LTTE re-grouping: JHU
	
The alleged plot to assassinate Tamil National Alliance (TNA) parliamentarian M.A.Sumanthiran that was uncovered recently signals the regrouping of the LTTE and the possibility of terrorism raising its ugly head once again in Sri Lanka, Jathika Hela Urumaya national organiser, Media Spokesman Nishantha Sri Warnasinghe today said.
He said that the Terrorism investigation Department (TID) and the other intelligence authorities were keeping a watchful eye the situation and stressed the need for vigilance.
?After the defeat of terrorism on May 19, 2009 several attempts were made by the leftovers of the LTTE to re-assemble and rise up as an organised group again. In 2016 a suicide vest was found in the Killinochchi area. These are not coincidences. If someone thinks these are minor issues they are completely wrong,? he said.
He further said that International governments and non-governmental organizations were trying hard to weaken the security net set up by the government by demanding the removal of high security zones, Army camps, check points and barracks.
?We were forced to reduce our security forces, a measure we were opposed to as a party even though there is no war at present. Fortunately today we were able to stop this murder attempt. To stop this tomorrow as well we should be better equipped,? he said.
?There are still people who dream of Eelam becoming a reality. The dark shadows of war have still not subsided. The risks still remain. The recent incidents teach us that we need to enhance our security arrangements further,?he said.
He further said that the country and the people greatly thank the security and the intelligence officials as they were not only stopped an assassination plot but an opportunity where country would have disgraced.
He also mentioned that the assassination plot was backed by the international diaspora including Norway based Perinbanayagam Sivaparan alias Nediyawan, France based Winayagam, who was a LTTE intelligence leader, US based Rudrakumar, who was the LTTE's legal advisor. Those mentioned here were reported to be involved in many wrongdoings such as collecting funds internationally to help the LTTE to re-group, he stressed.(Thilanka Kanakarathna)

The guilty should be punished: SF
	
Those who had been accused of war crimes must be punished irrespective of their posts and statuses if found guilty, Regional Development Minister Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka said today.
While speaking to the media at the Malwatte Maha Viharaya after meeting the Mahanayake Theras of the Malwatte and Asgiriya Chapters at their respective temples in Kandy, Field Marshal Fonseka reminisced how an Army Major was sentenced to death after he was proven to have passed information to terrorists.
The Minister during his meetings with the Malwatte Mahanayake the Most Ven. Thibbatuwawe Sri Siddhartha Sumangala Thera and the Asgiriya Mahanayake the Most Ven. Warakagoda Gnanarathana Thera explained the development projects in Kandy and other areas.
Accusing that allegations of war crimes had been leveled against the Army after the former ruler and the former Defence Secretary had brought politics into the Army, Minister Fonseka observed that there was no policy of turning a blind eye to the crimes or offences in the Army, except for the instances, where the former rulers had a policy of defending their offending henchmen.
He stated that no allegations of war crimes would have been levelled against the Army had the Army was allowed to maintain discipline among its rank and file.
"There was no threat of electric chair against the former President, but he instilled fear among the people by always talking about such a threat. It was we who commanded and fought the war, it was we who would have been sent to the electric chair, if actually there were such a threat.
?If the former President was taken to the electric chair, that would be a disgrace even to that chair," he said.
He argued that though the former President could bring thirty or fifty thousand people for a public meeting, he would have to muster support of 6.2 million people to topple a Government that has a mandate of 6.2 million voters.
The former Army Commander also reminded that that Karuna Amman, who lined up and killed 600 Policemen when he was in the LTTE, had been appointed Vice President of the SLFP by the former President. (Nadeeka Daya Bandara)

## Title: US judge blocks part of Trump?s immigration order

US judge blocks part of Trump?s immigration order
	
A US judge has issued a stay temporarily halting the deportation of visa holders or refugees under an executive order from President Trump.
The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) filed a lawsuit early on Saturday in response to the order.
The judge's stay prevents those "caught up" in the aftermath from being deported, the ACLU said.
The group estimates that between 100 and 200 people are being detained at airports or in transit.
The court decision came as hundreds protested at airports in several US states over Donald Trump's clamp down on immigration.
The ruling, from Judge Ann Donnelly, prevented the removal from the US of people with approved refugee applications, valid visas, and "other individuals... legally authorised to enter the United States".
Lee Gelernt, deputy legal director of the Immigrants Rights Project, argued the case in court and was greeted by a cheering crowd outside.
He said that some people had been threatened with being "put back on a plane" later on Saturday.
"The judge, in a nutshell, saw through what the government was doing and gave us what we wanted, which was to block the Trump order and not allow the government to remove anybody who has come and is caught up in the order, nationwide," he told the crowd.
He also said the judge had ordered the government to provide a list of names of those detained under the order.
"We are going to see each of the people, provide counsel, try and get them out of detention right now - but at minimum, they will not be returned back to danger," Mr Gelernt said.
The court has set a date to hear the case for the end of February.
"This is a remarkable day," said the ACLU's executive director, Anthony Romero.
"On day one after he signed the executive order, we took him to court? that it was unconstitutional, that it was un-American, and that it flew in the face of established statutes that we have long regarded in this country."
"What we've shown today is that the courts can work... they're a bulwark in our democracy, and when President Trump enacts laws or executive orders that are unconstitutional and illegal, the courts are there to protect everyone's rights."(BBC)
