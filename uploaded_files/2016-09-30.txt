Fitch rates DFCC Bank?s debentures up to Rs.7bn ?A+(lka)( EXP)?
	
Fitch Ratings has assigned DFCC Bank PLC?s (DFCC; AA-(lka)/Negative) proposed subordinated debentures of up to Rs.7 billion an expected national long-term rating of ?A+(lka)(EXP)?.
The proposed debentures, which will have tenures of five and seven years and carry fixed coupons, will be listed on the Colombo Stock Exchange. DFCC expects to use the proceeds to strengthen its Tier II capital base and manage maturity mismatches. The final rating is subject to the receipt of final documentation conforming to information already received. The proposed subordinated debentures are rated one notch below DFCC?s national long-term rating to reflect the subordination to senior unsecured debt.
DFCC?s rating captures its developing commercial banking franchise and still-high capitalisation. Its weaker asset-quality compared with better-rated peers weighs on its rating.?
The negative outlook on DFCC?s national long-term rating reflects weakening capital buffers that stem from weaker asset-quality metrics, increased loan growth and below-average internal capital generation.

Punjab border villages evacuated after army?s surgical strikes across LoC
	
Punjab authorities ordered the evacuation of villages near the Pakistan border on Thursday as chief minister Parkash Singh Badal put the state government and political machinery on emergency mode following surgical strikes against ?terror launchpads? across the Line of Control (LoC).
Union home minister Rajnath Singh talked to Badal over phone and requested him to start the evacuation of people in villages within 10 km of the border in view of the escalating tensions.
While monitoring the situation during an emergency meeting at his official residence, Badal directed chief secretary Sarvesh Kaushal and DGP Suresh Arora to ask deputy commissioners and senior superintendents of police to oversee the evacuation in Ferozepur, Fazilka, Amritsar, Tarn Taran, Gurdaspur and Pathankot.
The chief minister directed the DCs to identify a suitable location for setting up camps. The chief minister also spoke to cabinet ministers and MLAs to camp in the border districts in which their assembly constituencies fall and liaise with the district administration to ensure the smooth movement of residents of villages near the border.
Badal directed the chief secretary to immediately release Rs 1 crore each to all DCs of the six border districts to meet any exigency.
The chief minister called an emergency cabinet meeting at 6pm to review the situation.
In Kashmir, the army briefly stopped cross-LoC trade in Uri, citing ceasefire violations by Pakistan in Poonch and Nowgam.
District officials said village sarpanches and local administration were told to start the evacuation process as soon as possible. Border Security Force (BSF) put the IB on further alert after the surgical strikes.
As tensions mounted between the two countries, Border Security Force officials confirmed the beating retreat ceremony, held at the Wagah border in Punjab, was called off.
BSF officials said while the Indian flag will be lowered in the evening, none of the pomp and show will take place. All tourists turning up for the ceremony were turned back.
In the three border districts of Jammu, Samba and Kathua in Jammu and Kashmir, officials said no evacuation of villagers had started.

As a parent, there are a number of vital things that you plan for when your child is young. Things like where they?ll attend school, what sports you?ll encourage them to play and even what musical instrument they?ll learn.?
?The cost of raising a child has gone up significantly in recent years for Sri Lankans, spurred on by rising costs associated with every facet of our lives, from food, to transport, to tuition fees which means your savings may not be able to keep up with the rise in costs,? said NDB Wealth Financial Planner Christina Wesley.?
Yet, there?s another big decision that if made when your child is young, can really get them off on the right foot.
Setting up a savings account for your child and teaching them good financial habits early, are the simplest and easiest ways to ensure that your child is on track for a bright financial future. However, sometimes it can be difficult to know where to begin.?
To help you secure your child?s future, expert financial planner NDB Wealth offers a real-world solution for children?s savings, which far exceeds the minimal returns offered by traditional children?s savings accounts. ?Wesley was also quick to point out that savings plans offered by NDB Wealth puts rupees earned straight back into your child?s account and not into the price of a ?free? toy or trip as promoted by traditional children?s savings accounts.
The ?Kids Saver? account from NDB Wealth is unique because it is designed to give you and your child what you truly need from a hardworking savings account. Comparatively higher rates of interest earn significant returns while your money can be withdrawn in emergencies without having to pay penalties.

Take action against Perpetual Treasuries: Bandula to Govt.
	
UPFA MP Bandula Gunawardane yesterday questioned the government as to what action it would take in connection with the excessive profit of Rs.5.1 billion recorded by Perpetual Treasuries Limited (PTL) last year by trading Government Bonds.
MP Gunawardane, who said the government was keen to impose the Super Gains Tax to collect an income of Rs.50 billion from well to do business entities, should not hesitate to look into the excessive profits of Perpetual Treasuries Limited.
He said the government was deliberately preventing action being taken against the former CB governor and others who are involved in the scam.
?It was the UPFA Minister Mahinda Amaraweera who told the Bribery Commission of the former governor's connection to the scam. Still, no action had been taken against him or anyone else involved with the company,? he told the Daily Mirror.
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, before the announcement of the General Election, said a Parliament Select Committee (PSC) would be appointed to look into the incident regardless of the political party that went on to win the election.
?Regardless of the COPE probe into the issue, we request the Premier to keep his promise and appoint a PSC with the involvement of joint opposition MPs to probe the scam thoroughly,? he said.
The MP said Mr. Mahendran was not re-appointed because of the objection posed by President Sirisena.
However, he has since been given a more prominent role in the government?s plan to create 10 million employment opportunities. ?This is an even bigger role than the post of CB Governor,? he said.
In February last year, the Central Bank (CB) called for bids to raise Rs.1 billion but instead accepted Rs.10 billion at a higher rate and Perpetual Treasuries Limited, in which former Central Bank Governor Arjuna Mahendran?s son-in-law Arjun Aloysius worked, purchased a large part of the shares.
The profit earned by the company last year, Rs.5.1. billion, was a remarkable increase in profits compared to the Rs.959.5 million it earned the year before. (Lahiru Pothmulla)
