CID permitted to detain Indian national under PTA
	
The Fort Magistrate?s Court today allowed the CID to detain Marsili Thomas, the Indian national who was arrested recently, for three months under the Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA) for further investigation.
When Thomas was produced in the Court today, the Magistrate ordered the CID to produce the suspect in Court on October 23 for observation.
The CID arrested Thomas last Thursday while he was visiting the house of Namal Kumara, the Operation Director of the Anti Corruption Movement.
Kumara recently revealed a conspiracy to assassinate President Maithripala Sirisena and former Defence Secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa. (Shehan Chamika Silva)

Dynamic society with the Right to Information
	
To be well informed with a balanced awareness of important national issues is not only a right but also the responsibility of citizens who are committed to the goals of eco-friendly, sustainable development and a vision of a just, peaceful and all -inclusive society.? ?
The free media are expected to play a key role in this area which is regarded as one of the four pillars of democracy. Unfortunately some Sri Lankan media groups appear to be playing party politics with their news being spin-doctored on the basis of what contracts they get or what benefits they may obtain if any particular political party is in power. Therefore the people also get a distorted picture of what is happening in the political, socio-economic and other areas. Unfortunately this is happening despite the strict implementation of the right to information law from February 3, last year. Under this law, widely regarded as one of the most progressive pieces of legislation enacted by the shaky coalition government, the people have a right to ask any state institution or its RTI officer for information regarding contracts, tenders and expenditure on various projects ranging from road reconstruction to environmental issues. Most people appear to be unaware if not unconcerned about this vital right and prefer to believe some distorted news given to them by media groups with vested interests.?
Thankfully the media ministry from Friday will launch a wide-ranging programme to make the people aware of what they could do under the RTI law and that if the institution?s officer refuses to give them all the information within two weeks they could make an appeal to the independent RTI commission which has mandatory powers and is acting in a manner that consolidates democracy.?
This issue comes into focus as the United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO) marks the second year of its ?International Day for Universal Access to Information?. UNESCO says this day has particular relevance with the new 2030 Development Agenda, and in particular with Sustainable Development Goal target 16.10 which calls for ensuring public access to information and protection of fundamental freedoms.??
According to Human Rights Watch, ?Universal Access? is bound up with the right to seek and receive information, an integral piece of the right to free expression. It says that for instance in Venezuela, there will be little to celebrate. The Nicol?s Maduro administration downplays abuses by security forces and denies the existence of the country?s humanitarian crisis and the exodus of Venezuelans. It also fails to provide information of public interest, such as accurate statistics on the country?s health crisis and is doing its best to ensure no one else does, either.??
The Venezuelan NGO Espacio P?blico, which monitors free speech, submitted 31 information requests to the government last year under the country?s Constitution, which provides for the right of access to information and implementing laws. The requests asked authorities for information on topics ranging from access to drinking water to the police?s budget and the environmental impact of oil spilling by the state-owned company. None has received a response.?
Given the increasing difficulty independent media outlets face in operating, Venezuelans are turning to the Internet for news. But the state-owned company CANTV ?the main internet provider in Venezuela? has in recent months repeatedly blocked access to key news outlets according to the Venezuelan NGO Redes Ayuda. The government?s grip is making it harder for the millions who remain in Venezuela to know what is happening in their country.? Under former president Hugo Ch?vez Venezuela had a vibrant democracy and was cited as an example not only to South America but to the world.?
We hope that Sri Lanka also, now enjoying media freedom and the right to information, will not allow itself to be dragged into the cesspit where Venezuela is today. Responsible, eco-friendly citizens need to stand up and speak out for democracy, the rule of law and the people?s right to information.? ? ?

Green Choice Lanka  A humble approach to go green
     	 
  At the Daily Mirror, we believe that climate change is one of the greatest threats that we, as Sri Lankans, will face in the future.  Therefore, we intend to provide our readers with local and international content with the objective to educate and inspire. We would also like to learn from our valued readers about any ongoing initiatives in making Sri Lanka a more sustainable nation.   
 We aim to explore sustainable ways of living that have the most positive impact on not just our natural environment, but also for humans and animals.  
While topics such as global warming, pollution, and inequality are confronting, we believe it's time the media stopped shying away from these issues and became an active participant in finding solutions - and we hope you will join us. 
     
				 		 
	
	
?
As we move towards sustainable approaches to keep the country clean, many individuals have volunteered to make this an achievable task. With the ever-increasing usage of plastics and polythene, it has become a daily challenge to minimize the use of these non-biodegradable materials. The damage caused is irreversible and we humans are directly affected by these careless practices. It is in such a backdrop that one young lady decided to initiate Green Choice Lanka ? an environmental advocacy organisation to unify and protect Sri Lanka.
Green Choice Lanka is the brainchild of Upekshi Perera, who describes herself as a marketer by profession but also an ardent nature and wildlife wanderess by choice. ?As such I take any opportunity to explore the magic of Lanka, whether it is camping or roaming in a jungle, hiking the mountains or waterfalls, scuba diving, relaxing on the beach or a take simple walk in the night. Sri Lanka isn?t just my birthplace,? she said in an interview with Mirror for Hope.?It is everything to me and it breaks my heart when I see people engaging in careless practices. A major concern is in terms of waste management. I always wanted to start a project of this nature but I had to postpone it from time to time.?
?
For more details on upcoming projects visit the Green Choice Lanka FB page
?
Her passion to see a greener Sri Lanka encouraged her to establish Green Choice Lanka on September 1 as an Environmental Advocacy Organisation, with the intention of unifying and protecting the island, with all of Sri Lanka, for Sri Lanka. ?Whilst we are all aware of the massive waste disposal issues which have significantly polluted and impacted our environment, to date there is no contribution towards planning a mitigation process,? she continued. ?Our main focus through Green Choice is to strategically reduce the disposal of plastics and polythene through spreading awareness among the general public on topics such as the toxicity of plastic. In addition to that we also help them to understand that simplified lifestyle changes can make a massive difference resulting in ecological restoration. This is mainly aimed at an educational programme for the youth since they are our future.?
Several activities done by Green Choice Lanka includes engaging in beach and city-wise cleanups to socially portray the importance of keeping the community clean and approaching certain manufacturing companies to restrict their packing while suggesting alternative eco-conscious and compostable products to reduce the carbon footprint such as Areca leaf (Kolapath) plates. Upekshi also shares photos of beautiful sceneries in Sri Lanka, highlighting on why they shouldn?t be polluted in turn promoting sustainable tourism. ?We also encourage the use of Bamboo toothbrushes, bamboo and paper straws, reusable bags, bottles, mugs, wooded cutlery and looking at expanding the product portfolio to have alternative eco-conscious products to help customers in their everyday lifestyles.The organization is a one woman show but we have been reaching out to other voluntary organizations and individuals since unifying Sri Lanka is my main objective. We recently partnered with the Marine Environment Protection Authority (MEPA) for the International Cleanup Day project recently organized by Sri Lanka, which is an ideal example which had over 200 participants present from all walks of life.?
At Green Choice Lanka they advocate in bringing about a change.?It?s about developing a habit and remembering to carry your reusable bag to the supermarket or pola, to regain the practice of carrying a reusable bottle as we all did when in school, refuse the plastic straw, sit in and take away shops should focus on compostable lunch sheets.?
?
Our main focus through Green Choice is to strategically reduce the disposal of plastics and polythene through spreading awareness among the general public on topics such as the toxicity of plastic
?
?Time and negotiating with suppliers was the most challenging,? Upekshi continued. ?Time as it was many sleepless nights similar to those of assignments and business proposals you have to do on top of a full time job, especially because it started with a simple idea and concept, which then grew into bigger ideas and a wider mission and vision. Negotiation, as this sustainability initiative to me is not about making it a profit centre, but about making it affordable and reachable, thus negotiating best prices with certain suppliers was a crucial task. When I look back at the day it was launched I wonder whether I was even ready but it is always good to take a risk and see it work in the end.
Upekshi is currently working on an awareness walk and focusing on conducting educational programmes for the youth. In addition to that, a canal project is also in the lineup of upcoming events. In her concluding remarks, Upekshi asks all fellow Sri Lankans to look around and admire the beautiful surroundings. ?This is our home. If we don?t protect mother Lanka, who will? Sri Lanka is a little bit of everything, as Sir. Arthur C. Clarke quoted. We have the world?s largest blue whale, which has ever lived, the highest density of leopards in the world, world heritage citadels, mythical jungles, magical waterfalls, mighty mountains, ancient cities, historical harbours and forts to list. But do you want your next whale and dolphin excursion to be in an ocean full of plastic? Do you want your loved ones to constantly fall through the polluted air we breathe?If you say no, then change also begins with you. So take a minute to join in this journey to create a disposable plastic Free Sri Lanka.

Hoppers up from tonight: Canteen Owners?
	
All Island Canteen Owners? Association (AICOA) said today that they would increase hopper prices to Rs.15 from midnight today in the wake of yesterday?s gas price increase.
Speaking to the Daily Mirror AICOA Chairman Asela Sampath said they had had to spend about Rs. 6,000 of an extra amount for gas per month and added that it was not affordable for them.
The price of a 12.5 kg cylinder of gas had been increased by Rs.195 from last night. ?
?The Consumer Affairs Authority (CAA) also gave permission to increase the gas prices as requested by the gas companies. They did not consider the suffering of the people,? he said.
?The CAA should decide to impose a control price over food items. Therefore, we urged the CAA to impose a control price on foods.
?Until then, as canteen owners, we have decided to increase the price of a hopper to Rs. 15 from midnight today.
?Accordingly, no price increments would be affected so far by food varieties sold at canteens.
He said that as such a plain tea would be Rs.20, milk tea Rs.40, lunch packets (vegetable Rs.120, fish Rs.140 and chicken Rs.170) ) (Chaturanga Samarawickrama)

JO says Police behind plot to kill MR?s family members
	
The JO was of the opinion that the Police was behind the conspiracy to assassinate former President Mahinda Rajapaksa and his family members, JO member MP Shehan Semasinghe said today.
The CID informed Colombo Magistrate's Court on Tuesday that the Indian national had claimed that there was a plot to assassinate President Maithripala Sirisena and former President Mahinda Rajapaksa and his family members.
Addressing a news briefing, MP Semasinghe said the Police were seemed to be unconcerned with regard to the spreading speculation on the plot on the lives of President Rajapaksa and his family members.
?We saw on Wednesday as to how Police Spokesman SP Ruwan Gunasekera attempted to brush aside the widespread plot under the carpet, saying that nothing had yet been revealed in connection to such a plot,? the MP said.
?In such backdrop, when several news reports are being published in this regard, we can?t fathom as to why the Police has turned a blind eye,? he added.
He insisted the Government to tighten the security of Mahinda Rajapaksa and look into the matter seriously.
Meanwhile, D. V. Chanaka said both Arjuna Ranatunga and Dayasiri Jayasekara were responsible to the downfall of the Sri Lanka cricket.
?We recently heard both of them are accusing to each other on the pathetic state of the Sri Lanka cricket,? MP Chanaka.
?It is evident that officials are unduly intervening into the affairs of cricket which has resulted in such a desperate state in Sri Lanka cricket,? he added.?(Sheain Fernandopulle)? ??

Madura Kulatunga: Beyond the written word
	
I didn?t like dictionaries as a child. I remember being chided by my teachers for attempting to guess the meaning of a word without opting for the Big Book and I remember escaping their censure by guessing correctly.??
That was of course rare, but those rarities were (thankfully) enough to convince me that no one, not even self-proclaimed pundits in a language, can claim to know every word and phrase. More than anything else, I came to believe that one could not and would not master a language unless he or she is aware of the need for reference. That obviously needed the Big Book. Needless to say, I eventually took to it.??
I remember trying to memorize each and every term in it. I remember failing and I remember trying again and again. I realised soon enough that a dictionary was nothing more than what it was touted as: a reference book, akin to a kitchen utensil and to be privileged for its use. And like all reference books, it was fun and great when it was readily available. For that reason, I despised having to flip through page after page in my quest to understand a word or term I didn?t understand. I am still flipping those pages, but thanks to the Internet, I?ve come to realise that we don?t need to.??
Now the Internet is like the Wild West. There are no rules and there is no level playing field. You take things at their face value and if you think you are wrong, well then, there?s Google to refer to. Dictionaries have proliferated (as have fact-books and encyclopaedias), and in that free-for-all, interminable world online you never can be too sure about the truth. That, I suppose, is why we need a leveller, some fixed source which can be quoted and looked to in order to ensure that because of our need for a quick reference, we don?t shrug off the (as pertinent) need for accuracy. This is especially true for one?s mother tongue, more so than for English, I firmly believe.??
Madura Kulatunga is a familiar name to most Sri Lankans. He is not too young but he hasn?t mellowed with the passing of time. He exhibits a kind of na?vet? that is, for me, attributable to a sense of simplicity that he?s acquired and nurtured over many, many years. That simplicity has won him both friends and enemies. Well, it?s won him more of the former, but the point is that in a life as carefully sketched out as his it?s really no surprise to come across various pitfalls which have tripped lesser beings.??
Madura, as Sri Lankans who know (of) him know, filled a need. He filled a need for a virtual dictionary, a translator from the mother tongue to the language of the oppressor, English (and vice-versa). We first heard of him when he came up with a program to this tune and we heard of him again when he released it online. He set a standard. Others copied him. Does he lament? Of course not. Still, that doesn?t belittle the need for a brief biographical sketch. This is his story.??
He was born on March 23, 1980 in Matara. He entered Royal College eventually after his family moved to Colombo. I assume at the beginning that his school would have imparted to him a love for computers, but he is cautious about admitting to such a thing. And it?s not hard to figure out why: at a time when computers were owned by a few and mastered by even fewer people, schools couldn?t really afford to invest on the subject too much. Royal had a Computer Society, but this didn?t conceal the class discrepancies among those who owned PCs and those who did not. Because of that, not many from his school managed to master or be conversant in the subject.??
He did, however, jaunt off with his friends to Union Place every day to that now rarely seen and even more rarely visited site, the Internet caf?. Being the eager boy he was, he naturally revelled in surfing the web.??
?
He is, admittedly, full of surprises. He didn?t take to IT or even Science at Royal. He chose Commerce. Having passed out in 1999, he opted for the field he?d fallen in love with, and pursued a Diploma in Computing at the Youth Centre in Maharagama. After completing his course, he got himself enrolled at Abacus Computers in Nugegoda for a Special Diploma in Information Technology, by which time his parents (both civil servants who weren?t exactly reeking of wealth) bought him a Pentium III 733 MHz desktop: a dinosaur by today?s standards but worth its weight in gold back then.??
People have their weak points. Madura soon understood, while doing these courses, that he was deficient in English. Being the eager student he always was, he wanted to move beyond his curriculum and learn more. This, he realised soon enough, clashed with his less than excellent command of the language. He realised it even more as he bought a book on an area he felt his classes weren?t covering properly: Visual Basic.??
Naturally, he took to referring the Malasekara English to Sinhala dictionary, through which he was able to understand the intricacies of programming and coding he needed in order for his next endeavour: designing his own program.??
Having groped around with various ideas, he eventually hit on designing a dictionary. It was, he tells me quite frankly, a way of giving back. He admittedly had to resort to Malasekara most of the time and this, he argues cogently, was done with no malice or intent to steal. After testing the program when he finally came out with it on his friends? computers, he got their feedback, was encouraged by the fact that they loved it, and released it then and there. The date was November 23, the year 2002.??
Madura has a knack for numbers and he remembers the cost-and-price structure of his dictionary even now. For printing the CD cover and later packaging it, he had to spend about Rs.75. He sold the programme for Rs. 200 to a retailer who then marketed it for Rs. 300. Madura?s profit, after all that, amounted to Rs. 125, which had to take into account various capital equipment, including a CD writer that cost Rs.10,000. The dictionary, given that he?d marketed it well through word of mouth, caught on. Soon enough, it became popular.??
?
That was then. Six years later (in 2008), by which time more and more Sri Lankans were taking to the Internet, he made a website out of his program (maduraonline.com) and unveiled it to the world. It continues to gobble up users: as of November 28 this year it?s the 33, 803rd most visited website in the world and the 109th in Sri Lanka on alexa.com, which as Madura explains takes into account websites visited, not created, in a country (so that these include Facebook and Google).??
Despite all these achievements, he did not abandon his personal life. He studied. He passed out as a Microsoft Certified Systems Engineer in 2005. He obtained an MSc in Information Technology from Sikkim Manipal University (ICBT Campus) five years later. He was then recognised by the University of Moratuwa, when in 2009 he was invited to address a Symposium by Prof. Gihan Dias (who was instrumental in founding Sri Lanka?s first email system). Regarding the latter, he told me that while he?d been asked to come and present his website, he took the opportunity to instead explain to his audience the nuts and bolts of what he?d done.??
Madura Kulatunga has more reasons than one to be complacent. He is not. As I talk with him, I realise that despite the many offers that came his way from companies only too willing to buy him out, he stuck to ideals and refused them all. In one sense I believe he is correct: such companies hardly can do the kind of justice to the program that its owner did. He has also been careful in giving credit where it?s due. That, I suspect, has more to do with his idealism than anything else, a point I discern most clearly when it comes to his openness: the kind that makes him both an optimist and a firm believer in individual effort.??
Can he aspire for more? I think so. Should he? Yes. Will we profit by that? Of course. Should we be grateful? By all means.??

Moves to medicalise FGM A Female's Basic need 'Nicked'
	
A female may be the most controversial creation that ever happened on Earth. This is due to several reasons. Although the world depends on women to give birth and create future generations, women have in most instances been deprived of their basic right to live. A person?s sexual life is a private affair and this applies to all beings in the world. But when it comes to females, it is once again a public affair in many countries around the world. Although its origin is not known, the practice of female circumcision or Female Genital Mutilation (FGM) has been continued with since ancient times. While circumcision is practised in the Islamic community especially on men as a cultural and an obligatory duty, the same has been suggested and practised on women. However, health experts claim that male circumcision has stark differences in relation to female circumcision. Yet, the debate continues and it has once again become a topic of discussion among Muslim and community groups in Sri Lanka. Hence the Daily Mirror spoke to a few individuals in an attempt to weigh the pros and cons of this practice.? ?
Health experts claim that male circumcision has stark differences in relation to female circumcision
	These procedures?are done under unhygienic and unsterile conditions and ultimately developes infections
	Pieces of a woman?s body shouldn?t be?taken away?unless there?s a medical reason
	The joint Muslim groups stated that the Muslim community is very concerned about moves to ban this obligatory Islamic duty
	Such a religious obligation practiced?by the Muslims in keeping with the requirements?of the Islamic faith is not FGM
Types of FGM? ?
As defined by the World Health Organisation (WHO) female genital mutilation comprises all procedures involving partial or total removal of the external female genitalia or other injury for female medical organs for non-medical reasons. The four types of FGM include :? ?
Type I : Also known as Clitoridectomy, this type consists of partial or total removal of the clitoris and/or its prepuce.? ?
Type II: Also known as Excision, the clitoris and labia minora are partially or totally removed, with or without excision of the labia majora.? ?
Type III : The most severe form, it is also known as infibulation or pharaonic type. The procedure consists of narrowing the vaginal orifice with creation of a covering seal by cutting and a-positioning the labia minora and/or labia majora, with or without removal of the clitoris.? ?
Type IV: This type consists of all other procedures to the genitalia of women for non-medical purposes, such as pricking, piercing, incising, scraping and cauterisation.? ?
?FGM has nothing to do with religion or culture?
-Ameena Hussein
Airing her views regarding FGM, sociologist, novelist and editor Ameena Hussein said that currently Sri Lankan Muslim women don?t have a choice on undergoing circumcision or hoodectomy, as some like to call it because it is performed on infant girls or around 7-8 years of age. ?It is an irreversible procedure. I have heard of the arguments on this subject where it is said that it was done to inhibit the sexual drive of women. But now the pro circumcision lobby public relations bureau says it is for health reasons and to enhance the woman?s sexual experience. Whatever their reasons we need to ensure it is illegal to be conducted on female infants, or girl children,? opined Hussein.?
?

?
She further said that if any adult woman, Muslim or otherwise, wishes to undergo the procedure, she should be able to. ?The age of consent should be 18. This has nothing to do with religion or culture and has everything to do with the protection of the girl child,? she added.? ?
?Procedures?done under unhygienic, unsterile conditions??
-Prof.Hemantha Dodampahala
In his comments Consultant Obstetrician and Gynaecologist Professor Hemantha Dodampahala said that the clitoris is the most important organ in a woman?s body. ?It is similar to the phallus (penis) of a male and has all the senses that bring about a sexual drive in a woman. It is rich in nerves and has a definite function in a female?s sexuality. Hence it plays an immense role in the act of sexual intercourse.?
As such in my opinion, circumcision is a cruel, unkind and unfound practice. These procedures are done under unhygienic and unsterile conditions and ultimately developes infections, resulting in the closure of the urethra and the vagina.?
In certain instances it may affect child birth due to a massive narrowing of the vagina. As such FGM has an impact on the entire process of a child?s delivery,? Dodampahala said.? ?
?Pieces of a woman?s body shouldn?t be taken away?
-Dr. Sepali Kottegoda
Dr. Sepali Kottegoda, Executive Director of the Women and Media Collective, said that female circumcision takes away the sexual pleasure of a woman. ?From what I have heard, it is being done to keep girls from getting into relationships and is a practice done in Sub-Saharan countries. It shouldn?t be done because it is an extremely cruel practice. Pieces of a woman?s body shouldn?t be taken away unless there?s a medical reason. Say for example if a person has breast cancer or appendicitis then a surgical procedure could be done, but not otherwise. This push for FGM is alien to Sri Lanka. People trying to come in, to justify an inhumane and unnatural procedure is appalling and disgusting. How can men decide about a woman?s sexual life? It is the woman who has to deal with it for the rest of her life. However there may be some women who would say that it is good, but we need to ask whether there is an element of choice. From what I see there doesn?t seem to be a choice. Hence, in that case are Sri Lankans ? those citizens from a secular state- going to sit back and watch??? ?
Call for female circumcision to be medicalised
During early September, a number of Sri Lankan Muslim groups called on the Government to medicalise female circumcision. In representations made to the Parliamentary Committee on Women and Gender, members of the All Ceylon Jamiyathul Ulama, All Ceylon YMMA Conference, Centre for Islamic Studies and United Religions Initiative urged the Ministry of Health to withdraw a recent circular prohibiting medical professionals from carrying out female circumcision.? ?
In their submission, the joint Muslim groups stated that the Muslim community is very concerned about moves to ban this obligatory Islamic duty on the grounds that it is Female Genital Mutilation (FGM). They said that the practice of female circumcision is an obligatory Islamic duty which confers a number of health benefits and that it is not FGM.?
?As such in my opinion, circumcision is a cruel, unkind and unfound practice
Hence they condemned the move to ban the practice of female circumcision by legislation and/or Government bodies. They further urged that no moves should be?
made in this regard in which case they would consider it as an unwarranted intrusion and an infringement of their religious duties guaranteed by the law and constitution of Sri Lanka.? ?
The group further stated that although Muslims wholeheartedly support the abolition of traditional practices harmful to women and children such as FGM, in case it is shown to exist in Sri Lanka, the Islamic practice of female circumcision is vastly different.?
As such religious obligation practiced by the Muslims of the country for centuries in keeping with the requirements of the Islamic faith is not FGM.?
The submission further stated that since this is a religious obligation, almost all Muslim Women and girls would have to undergo the procedure by hiring the services of traditional female circumcisers known as Ostha Mamis in case doctors refuse to perform this procedure citing the above mentioned circular. This could lead to serious medical complications which would amount to FGM.? ?
How can men decide about a woman?s sexual life
Long -term consequences? ?
Once the clitoris and the surrounding tissues are removed the girl or woman is at risk of developing infections. Hence there could be long term consequences which include :? ?
Urinary problems (painful urination, urinary tract infections);? ?
Vaginal problems (discharge, itching, bacterial vaginosis and other infections);? ?
Menstrual problems (painful menstruations, difficulty in passing menstrual blood, etc.)? ?
Sexual problems (pain during intercourse, decreased satisfaction, etc.);? ?
Increased risk of childbirth complications (difficult delivery, excessive bleeding, caesarean section, need to resuscitate the baby, etc.) and newborn deaths;? ?
Need for later surgeries: for example, the FGM procedure that seals or narrows a vaginal opening (Type III) needs to be cut open later to allow for sexual intercourse and childbirth (de-infibulation). Sometimes genital tissue is stitched again several times, including after childbirth, hence the woman goes through repeated opening and closing procedures, further increasing both immediate and long-term risks;? ?
psychological problems (depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, low self-esteem, etc.);? ?

MR asks whether Mangala?s statement reflects Govt?s opinion
	
Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa yesterday denounced Minister Mangala Samaraweera?s response to Archbishop Malcolm Cardinal Ranjith and asked whether the response was the government?s opinion.
He expressed these views to media after a group of Catholic MPs and Provincial Councillors met him to express their displeasure over Minister Samaraweera?s response.
?We want to know whether this is the opinion of the government or its policy. We condemn Minister Samaraweera?s statement. Even many Buddhists, Muslims, Hindus and Catholics spoke to me and said they are against this. The Cardinal has simply made a statement inside a church during a service. Criticizing it in this manner is wrong,? he said.
Mr Rajapaksa said the Prime Minister should make a statement over the issue.?We see this as a bad precedent. If statements of religious leaders were continued to be defamed like this, there will be no end to it,? he said.
In response to Archbishop Cardinal Malcolm Ranjith?s remarks that human rights had become the religion among the Western nations, Finance Minister Samaraweera said the Cardinal seems to got things wrong in trying to be a populist.
In a tweet, the Minister said, ?The need for Human Rights was an outcome of the marauding religious zealots of the Inquisition and the Crusades, where non-believers were massacred "En-Bloc". Pity, the Cardinal always seems to get things wrong in trying to be a populist,?
Meanwhile, the Cardinal sent a clarification and said, "What I basically intended to say on this matter was that if religion is truly practised it could take us to achieve levels of justice, going even beyond the expectations of human rights and thus need not be such an issue for our Catholic community and so encouraged the flock gathered at that particular religious ceremony to, therefore, practice their faith truthfully avoiding turning religious values into something that is ephemeral. But I do accept that with regard to the essentially non-religious nature of the State, human rights as a common platform has its own role to play. Replacing religion with human rights is not what is to be done but human rights should be further strengthened through the good practice of faith,' (Lahiru Pothmulla)

Notes for a Manifesto: environment, development, caricature and extremism
	
There are no two ways to think of the environment. This doesn?t mean there?s only one way. There are in fact countless ways of understanding and engaging with the world around us. The environmental cake, so to speak, can be cut in many ways; according to the ?needs? of the moment, envisaged futures, cultural habits, philosophical frameworks, theories of being etc. It?s a cat, so to speak, that can be skinned in many ways and in fact is being skinned in many ways as we write.? ?
We need not go into all that here. What needs to be done is to examine the extremisms with respect to the environment. Broadly speaking there are two kinds of extremisms. One could characterize them as follows.? ?
There?s the human-centrist school which sees everything outside the species as dispensable or as having potential to serve human interests. ?Human? here needs to be fleshed out a bit; many things are done in the name of entireties but in fact they serve the interests of one or few and usually a particular category of people. Theories are constructed to justify carefully suppressing or footnoting the uncomfortable. For example, the term ?imponderable? is used and so too ?externality?. Throw those out and we get neat equations such as demand and supply curves which intersect at ?price?. Sure, pressure from objectors have forced such theories to be refined and be accorded a veneer of inclusivity, but they are not fooling too many people.? ?
Justification comes in the form of utopias that are aggressively marketed. The ?poverties? of the present are used as alibis and goodies called progress and development are swung like carrots in front of the impoverished. The entire story is not told. Not all costs are talked about. Instead we are sold ?imperatives?. And if anyone dares talk about uncomfortable truths such as global warming or climate change then the entire discourse is shifted to scientific exchange where those with bucks and power get to commission and thereafter market ?value-free truths? supposedly obtained scientifically.? ?
Human beings have always had to deal with the world around them. In fact no creature is self-contained. The trick is to figure out a mode of engagement that is wholesome, something that of course detracts by the very fact of engagement but at the same time consciously supports regeneration? ? ?
It?s all in the name of ?The People? and Mister Progress. Then there are those at the other extreme who sometimes operate as though human beings should not disturb the natural process at all. They protest (nothing wrong in that), they litigate (nothing wrong in that) and they talk of dire consequences. They too, ironically, bring in ?the future? but of course in a more worried tone.? ?
Human beings have always had to deal with the world around them. In fact no creature is self-contained. The trick is to figure out a mode of engagement that is wholesome, something that of course detracts by the very fact of engagement but at the same time consciously supports regeneration. Let?s return to this later.? ?
There are people who argue, cogently, that a certain degree of economic prosperity is necessary before a nation can shift to a green economy (another easy and abused term by the way). A country like Sri Lanka, even if it retired environmental concerns for the next decade, cannot impact the global environment in any significant way (let?s ignore for now the story of little drops of water and little grains of sand). It can be argued also that if development is dumped in favor of environment, the price will have to be paid by the poor and this will invariably transform into environmental costs that are worse, at at best, pretty much the same.? ?
These arguments are articulated in discussions on a wide range of subjects, especially when it comes to energy, waste disposal, industries and agriculture. Costs, benefits, renewability and recovery rates feature significantly in the debates.? ?
Lost in all this is an overall framework of what ?development? truly means. Where are we heading or rather what kind of destination would we like to walk towards? What are the costs we are willing to pay? What kind of benefit-package would we be satisfied with? What are the parameters and who gets to decide and impose them?? ?
Strategy is what?s missing. We have the laws and regulations. They are framed by political prerogatives and ideological preferences. They are in effect footnoted. They are taken in isolation. By the way, that?s part of the process of control and extraction; compartmentalization is a neat term for divide and rule after all. Set developmentalists against environmentalists and systems of destruction and exploitation remain secure ? it can suffer some hair-splitting at the periphery and indeed needs such hair-splitting.? ?
There?s no bottom line. Well, there is, but it?s thick. It has to contain the health of the planet (no, not just the nation), the health of the people currently alive and those who are yet to arrive. We need to talk about decent, healthy and environment-friendly lifestyles. We need to revisit the discourse of freedom and limitations of the same. We have to recognize that politics (and therefore power) is part of the story and devise strategies that consider such factors instead of meekly submitting to them or pretending they don?t exist. We have to factor in the reality of corruption. There are loopholes and there?s bulldozing through barricades. We cannot legislate against all these, but we can find different ways of empowering rational, civilized and responsible objection.? ?

We need to talk about decent, healthy and environment-friendly lifestyles. We need to revisit the discourse of freedom and limitations of the same.
This is the only planet we have. This is the only life I have. It?s all you have too. Life would include concerns and aspirations, not just for self but for friends, families and larger collectives we identify with. All this is part of the story. The people, the nation, the present and future are subverted by caricature, extremism, compartmentalization and distraction. Potential candidates need to be clear, comprehensive and committed.? ?
Over to you, Messers Nagananda Kodituwakku, Rohan Pallewatte, Gotabaya Rajapaksa, Patali Champika Ranawaka, Ranil Wickremesinghe, Maithripala Sirisena and any other individual entertaining hopes of becoming the next President of Sri Lanka.? ?

Online booking launched for long-distance private buses
	
The National Transport Commission (NTC) has launched an online booking facility for long distance private buses starting from Colombo with effect from October 1.
The Transport Ministry said passengers who travelled long distances would now have the opportunity of booking seats online through the website www.ntcbooking.lk.
This facility was launched by Transport Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva at the Ministry premises Wednesday evening.
The Ministry said passengers would be charged Rs.30 in addition to the bus fare when making an online booking.
?With this new facility, passengers can book their seats without any inconvenience,? an official from the ministry said.
Under the first phase, the NTC had provided the facility to book seats on 35 long-distance routes starting from Colombo such as to Kataragama, Jaffna, Badulla, Ampara, Deniyaya, Passara, Lunugala, Akuressa, Thirukovil, Batticaloa, Point Pedro, Madolsima, Anuradhapura, Dayagama and Trincomalee.

Sanga wants SL to concentrate on 2019 World Cup
	
Former Test captain Kumar Sangakkara has urged the Sri Lankan team to rethink its strategies moving forward after the team?s failed campaign in the six-nation Asia Cup tournament.
The five-time winners crashed out in the first round after humiliating defeats at the hands of Bangladesh and Afghanistan.
?We need to find out whether we have the right strategy in place. Whether we should change it or stick to it. Results on tours are important, but the larger picture should be the 2019 World Cup. We need to have a settled batting lineup. We need to identify the openers, identify who our number three is going to be and who is going to bat at number six and things like that.
?Those players whom we have identified need to be given an extended run. You need to have specific chats with players explaining what is expected of each of them.?
Some of the changes that Sri Lanka did during the Asia Cup like reversing the roles of Kusal Mendis and Kusal Perera backfired. While Mendis opened the innings, Perera batted at number four. Mendis was dismissed without scoring on both occasions.
?The confidence levels drop if they are moved up and down. You need to identify the engine room of the batting lineup from number one to four and others should play around them. With two new balls, your openers are vital. Number three and four are very important as well and they have to shoulder most of the burden in batting.
?Then, of course, number five and six, they need to be able to accelerate and, in case if there?s a top order collapse, they should be able to steady the innings. They need to clarify the roles and have an idea what is required of each player,? Sangakkara said.
?Why they have inconsistent results is that they are yet to get settled. They need to build a team culture, a team strategy. They need to persevere with a set of players consistently for the biggest tournament in cricket.?(Hindustan Times)

SL should have an export driven economy to overcome economic crisis: PM
	
Sri Lanka would not have been affected by the current global economic crisis if the country did not get into a debt trap like the one it has got into, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said yesterday.
Mr Wickremesinghe expressed this sentiment at the prize giving of Maliyadeva Balika Maha Vidyalaya in Kurunegala in the morning.
?Sri Lanka is largely affected by the devaluation rupee because of the debt trap it has got into. We would not have been affected by the devaluation issue if we did not get into a debt trap. We have to pay $ 3,000 million this year to settle debts while a sum of $ 4000 million has to be paid next year. Therefore one could see that what we inherited are past sins. What we have to do now is to overcome this situation,? the Prime Minister said.
? Anyhow the current global crisis affects both the household economy and the national economy. We are fully aware of it. Some countries such as Thailand and Vietnam are not severely affected by the global economic crisis as they fully depend on exports,? the Prime Minister added while stressing that Sri Lanka too should go for an export-driven economy in order to get out of the present crisis.
The Prime Minister said Sri Lanka has failed to focus on building up an export-driven economy for the last ten years. ? It will take at least three years to build such an economy. Attracting investors and establishing export zones is a time-consuming job. However, we have already embarked on such a program. Kurunegala, Kandy and South have been identified as locations where export zones would be opened. The Central highway which is being constructed now will be helpful to the export zone which will come in the North-Western Region. An 800-acre export zone will be built in Bingiriya. Such zones will come in Kurunegala as well. There will be a 10,000-acre zone in Hambantota. There will also be one in Kalutara,? he also said.
Further, the Prime Minister said Sri Lanka will need skilled and knowledgeable people when various kinds of industries come up in Sri Lanka and added that such persons will be produced through a modernized education system. (Yohan Perera)

SLIM - Serving the nation through National level events
	
As the national body for marketing, the Sri Lanka Institute of Marketing (SLIM) organises six national level events annually, which focus on various aspects of marketing and a range of market segments, with the ultimate aim of positioning the field of marketing as a prominent driver of economic growth.

Excerpts of this interview:? ?
Q What will be the future of the present government in a situation where there is a rift between the President and the Prime Minister?
It became clear at the last local government elections that the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) is no longer a political force to reckon with. All the political forces led by SLFP have been absorbed by the political front called ?Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP)?. In that sense, SLPP is not a new political force. It is actually the political force previously led by the SLFP. The political alliance led by leaders such as Mahinda Rajapaksa, Vasudeva Nanayakkara and Dinesh Gunawardane, is nothing but an extension of the left of centre political front led by the late Prime Minister Sirimavo Bandaranaike. President Sirisena, in fact, leads a new political movement under the SLFP label, though. The SLFP cannot win elections under the current circumstances. That is the reality.? ?
It is one aspect. Despite being the ruling party, the United National Party (UNP), for the first time in history, got thrashed at a local government election. For the first time, a ruling party was thrashed at a local authorities? election in this manner. In 2002, the UNP, as the ruling party, won such elections comfortably.??
Whatever it boasts about, the UNP cannot afford to lose another election. If it gets defeated at another election, it will signal the political end of the party. The fate that befell the SLFP will befall the UNP as well. The UNP did not read the election results of the 2015 polls and the local government polls this year.? ?
The outcome of the 2015 elections was interpreted as a mandate for the UNP. The middle class of this country wanted to embark on a new political journey. Certain UNP leaders cast aside such expectations of the people. The bond scam and the adoption of age-old economic models are examples in this instance. Our economy is embroiled in a cauldron of issues.? ?
When the late President J. R. Jayewardene opened up the economy, we had cheap labour and resources. There were lenient labour and environmental laws. So, we could attract investors. Actually, 70 percent of the world export market was concentrated in Europe and the United States.? That model was successful because of these advantageous conditions. Ground realities are totally different today. We do not have cheap labour any more. We have rigid environment laws today. In the world export market, the share of the United States and Europe accounts for 50 percent only. We have certain restrictions in tapping these markets now. This factor driven model is no longer valid.? ?
?It is fiction that the country cannot be developed without abolishing executive presidency?
Also, there is a school of thought here now that investors can be attracted by creating liberal socio-economic conditions. They believe investors are attracted to countries where homosexuality is legalized, press freedom is high and minority rights are guaranteed. It was a valid concept when globalization and liberalization were taking place in the world.? ?
Today, investors can only be attracted by creating stability in the country. The United States is no longer following globalization. Investors are not bothered whether people in the country concerned have voting rights or not. They need stability. Today, investors see Sri Lanka as a place inflicted by chaos. We need a new economic way out.??
Q Is the government ready for it?
That is the problem with this government. Those who handle the economy in this government have not understood it. They have not understood both international and local phenomena. So, they try to apply the same old economic formula to address the current issues. The models of J.R. Jayewardene, Chandrika Kumaratunga and Mahinda Rajapaksa do not work. We are at a transitional stage now.??
Q How do you look to the next presidential election in that context??
It will not be an election to be based on popular ideologies. We have to understand local and international phenomena. The outcome of this election is bound to depend on the level of our understanding on issues at hand in such contexts. It is fiction that the country cannot be developed without abolishing executive presidency and devolving power to the north and the east. Such measures will only destabilize Sri Lanka further. When there is no stability, no investor will come. Investors who are already here will also leave the country then. Our challenge is to understand this global phenomenon. Secondly, we cannot count on post war dividends now. We are faced with the biggest debt burden.? ?
Already, we have pruned the powers of the President. There is nothing left to be pruned.? ?
Q What do you think of the 20th Amendment brought by the JVP?
If it is enacted, the country will be destabilized further. If we do away with the presidential system, we should revert to the old electoral system. That is the only way to stabilize the country. Our judiciary looks old fashioned. All other sectors have improved, but the judiciary has not been modified. It is a place where cases are dragged on for years. So, justice is not meted out. We need total reforms to it.??
Before implementing vision 2025, they have to implement vision 2020
Q If the 20th Amendment is taken up for vote in Parliament, will you vote against?
The 20th Amendment is obviously harmful to the country?s stability. If the executive presidency is abolished, the old constituency based electoral system should be reintroduced. There is no room for destabilizing the country.??
Q What do you think of the UNP talking about its Vision 2020 programme?
The parties can say whatever they want to boost the morale of their rank and file. That is a different case. Yet, it is not realistic. Before implementing vision 2025, they have to implement vision 2020. The UNP did not do the necessary reforms needed to face elections next year. The UNP is internally faced with a severe crisis.? ?
Politics in our country is also backward-looking. We have a new breed of business leaders in the country today. The wealthiest businessmen belong to this category. They are from ordinary backgrounds. Yet, they are leading the business sector.? ?
Those who are in the highest echelon of the medical profession are from humble beginnings with their school education at ordinary central colleges. It is the same story with regards to engineers, administrative service officials including the Secretary to the President. It is the same story in the world as well. Our politics has not changed though. We have the Rajapaksa family at one end of politics, and a coterie of persons from some elitist schools at the other.? ?
Yet, those who came from central colleges dominate other sectors of the country. They have been excluded from politics, though.? ?
Q What is your plan for the next year?
This country should identify its priorities. One is the economic model we need. Countries such as China, South Korea, Japan and others developed because they realized their comparative advantages and built on them.? Our geographical location is our advantage. Also, we have our knowledge workers. We have 20 million brains.? ?
When there is no stability, no investor will come. Investors who are already here will also leave the country then
Q The President recently said that the Prime Minister?s post is more powerful than the presidential post. What is your response?
It is true that the executive President got some arbitrary powers under the 1978 Constitution. But, there are checks and balances introduced by the then President J.R. Jayewardene. In this regard, it is the Parliament that is keeping it in check.? ?
The US President can appoint anyone outside the Senate or the Congress as a Minister. There are different ways to ensure checks and balances. Yet, the President of Sri Lanka has to choose the Ministers from among the Members of Parliament only. Parliament is the only body that can legislate. Parliament can decide whether to prune the presidential powers or not. Sri Lanka Parliament is responsible not only for law making but is also having control over police finance. Without parliamentary support, the President cannot govern. In the past, there was no question in this regard because the successive Presidents had their parties controlling Parliament. For the first time, we experienced departure from this when the United National Party took control of Parliament under then President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga from another party. On that occasion, presidency was in the hands of another party. It became apparent then that the President?s hands were tightened without parliamentary power.? ?
With the enactment of the 19th Amendment to the Constitution, the President?s power was further pruned. Though executive presidency is projected as a dictatorial model, the President is virtually a wing-clipped bird in the absence of parliamentary support. It becomes clear when the President belongs to one party and the Prime Minister to another.? ?
Q The President said one should consider who should be the Prime Minister next. What is your view?
There is euphoria created about the presidential election at the moment. Of course, what is more powerful is the Prime Minister?s post. The President cannot govern without the support of the Prime Minister. It remained the same with power. It is more so after the enactment of the 19th Amendment.? ?

The opposite of President?s UN remark will happen: Bhikshu Forum
	
Referring to the recent remark made by President Maithripala Sirisena at the United Nations (UN) General Assembly, the National Academic Bhikshu Forum (NABF) today said something would happen exactly to the opposite of what President Sirisena had claimed before the international community.
President Sirisena on Tuesday called on the international community to allow Sri Lankan people to solve their problems on their own as being an independent country.
NABF Convener Prof. Ven. Maduruoye Dhammissara Thera told a news conference that there was no credibility in the statements made by President Sirisena and added he had made similar claims even before which were of no use.
?President Sirisena has guaranteed us that he would not let any authority to implement laws against soldiers. However, such laws were implemented soon after President Sirisena?s guarantee of not doing so,? the Thera said.
?President Sirisena has also guaranteed that he would not proceed with the proposed 20th Amendment to the Constitution. However, the background has already been established to proceed with it,? the Thera added.
The Thera said accordingly something opposite would occur in future rather solving country?s problems in our own without the interference of international community as claimed by President Sirisena.
Meanwhile, the NABF urged Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe to withdraw the proposed 20th Amendment to the Constitution by making a statement in Parliament if he was truly concerned about Buddhism.
Ven. Dhammissara Thera said the proposed 20th Amendment to the Constitution would be detrimental to the country if it would be implemented because it would result in promoting separatism in the country; ?There is no need for a new Constitution or Amendment to the prevailing Constitution,? the Thera added.

US warns Iran of ?hell to pay? if crossed
	
?
President Donald Trump has lashed out at Iran, with national security adviser John Bolton also warning there would be ?hell to pay? if Tehran crossed the US.??
Speeches by the president before the UN General Assembly and by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Mr Bolton at a New York City hotel marked an escalation of rhetoric.??
Mr Trump blasted what he called Iran?s ?corrupt dictatorship? and accused its leaders of enriching themselves through embezzlement and raiding state coffers to spread ?mayhem?.??
Mr Trump also vowed to continue to isolate Iran through US sanctions that are being re-instated following his withdrawal from the 2015 nuclear deal.? The next round of sanctions will take effect in early November.??
He later predicted that the pressure from renewed sanctions would force Iran back to the table to negotiate.??
?Iran?s leaders sow chaos, death and destruction,? the president told the UN General Assembly in a 34-minute speech that was more critical of Iran than any other country.??
?They do not respect their neighbours or borders or the sovereign rights of nations. Instead Iran?s leaders plunder the nation?s resources to enrich themselves and to spread mayhem across the Middle East and far beyond.???
In an even more fiery to a group opposed to the Iran deal, Mr Bolton went further.??
?If you cross us, our allies, or our partners; if you harm our citizens; if you continue to lie, cheat and deceive, yes, there will indeed be hell to pay,? he said.??
?The murderous regime and its supporters will face significant consequences if they do not change their behaviour. Let my message today be clear: We are watching, and we will come after you.??

WM Mendis & Co lawyers level allegations against CID, AG?s dept.
	
During today's Magisterial inquiry conducted into the controversial bond scam, serious allegations had been levelled against the Attorney General's Department and the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) by the defense counsel, over the alleged recording of statements from three individuals of W.M. Mendis & Company by force.
In these recorded statements,?the three individuals had stated that they were asked to give false statements to the CID by their lawyer.
The allegation against two senior officers of the AG?s Department was that they had summoned this particular lawyer and asked to provide some documents of WM Mendis & Company to prevent taking action against him, based on those statements in which he was accused of instructing his client to give false evidence to the CID.
At the onset of the inquiry, it was explained in court about several incidents alleged to have taken place during the last few weeks.
According to the defense counsel, there were three employees of WM Mendis & Company who had initially given statements to the CID.
These three employees had been called again to the CID to record further statements during last August.
In these statements, in a confessional manner, the employees had said that they were instructed to give false statements to the CID by their lawyer (Mr. Chandana Perera).
However, President's Counsel Upul Jayasuriya who appeared today on behalf of these three employees informed the court that his clients were intimidated by the CID from time to time, threatening to remand them if they did not give statements favouring the prosecution.
Jayasuriya PC also levelled allegations against the CID regarding the manner in which some officers had forcibly recorded statements from his clients, which is illegal.
He informed the court that his clients are no longer willing to give statements to the CID at the department, but would be ready to do it in the court premises.
President's Counsel Wasantha Navaratne Bandara appeared on behalf of Mr. Chandana Perera (Attorney-at-law of three WM Mendis & Company employees).?
Bandara PC said following the alleged forcible recording of statements from those three employees by the CID, their lawyer Chandana Perera had been summoned to the Attorney General's Department by two senior officials of the AG's department, where they informed him of his clients' recent statements, accusing him of instructing to give false evidence. .
Bandara PC also informed Court that Chandana Bandara was then allegedly threatened by the two officials of the AG's Department that his cloak can be removed if the CID files action against him over the incident that he instructed his clients to give false statements.
Bandara PC also said that in compromise to that and to prevent taking legal action against him, the two AG'S Department officials had asked ?Chandana Perera to bring the relevant cheques relating to WM Mendis & Company (as evidence) to the prosecution and to accept that they knew about the abbreviations of Ravi K, RW and NR.
PC was of the view that the Attorney General can only exercise powers vested on him by law, hence, such a demand would be an unlawful effort by the prosecution.
It was said that the counsel had already lodged complaints regarding this matter and sent copies and the affidavits to the Attorney General as well.
However, Senior Additional Solicitor General Yasantha Kodagoda completely rejected the allegations put forward against the Attorney General's Department and sought copies of the complaints and the affidavits of the individuals who are complaining in this regard, to peruse and respond to the allegations at the next court hearing.
Meanwhile, Perpetual Treasuries Ltd. owner Arjun Aloysius and its CEO Kasun Palisena were also ordered to be re-remanded till October 11 by the magistrate over the magisterial inquiry in which they were accused of abetting and conspiring with Arjuna Mahendran to misappropriate public funds worth Rs. 688 million during the Bond auction held on February 27, 2015.
Aloysius and Palisena were also re-remanded by the Fort Magistrate till October 11 over the parallel magisterial inquiry conducted relating to the Bond scam on deleting phone call data from Perpetual Treasuries Ltd. voice recording system and fabricating evidence to the Bond Commission.

Accessibility to buildings, places  Indispensable need  to enjoy Civil Rights
	
Have you not yet realised that the chances are now very high that, at any stage or any moment in life, for a short time or for a long time, for different reasons, you or your loved ones, could experience physical and/or sensory impediments, and fall into the category of ?People with Disabilities? as defined by the Law?? ?
You will then realise that the world around you once you knew to be cheerful and kind, is no more so; and most of your essential needs and activities that were easy doing, are now a burden and you are unwanted and depending on others? At this very moment, an estimated 20% of fellow citizens (i.e. four million) are in this plight; and you would soon be merely one of such affected persons. The design of your home, office, places of recreation, shops, banks and restaurants, stairs, toilets, doorways and ramps, ATMs, the web or phones could no longer be easily used.? ?
The world around would marginalize you and discriminate against you beyond expectations, perhaps for a lifetime. As fate is no respecter of persons and positions, tomorrow will be too late for you and your loved ones. As such, quality of our own life depends heavily on buildings and environment we build. Are they accommodating, safe and user-friendly? They are yet not built so!? ?
That is why you cannot wait ineptly but must fight now for equality of treatment to enjoy your civil rights and bring constant pressure on decision makers.? ?
Impediments in real world? ?
Any person, who, as a result of any deficiency in his physical or sensory or mental capabilities, if unable by himself to ensure for himself, wholly or partly, the necessities of daily life, is recognised by law, as a Person with dis-Ability or a dis-Abled ? (Differently Able is a false, injurious terminology). The affected include Senior Citizens (heading towards 18%), those fallen by Accidents and numerous debilitating Medical Conditions and the Convalescent,and even the pregnant experiencing restricted movements.? ?
Public Buildings and public facilities mean any building or facility, owned either by the State or Private Sector that the public needs to use in daily life, as categorized and listed under the existing Laws.? ?
Legislations gathering cobwebs
Sri Lanka enacted the Protection of the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act No: 28 of 1996. Clause 23(2) of this Act stipulates:? ?
?No person on the ground of Disability, be subjected to any Liability or Restriction with regard to access to or use of ANY BUILDING or Place which any other Member of the Public has access to or is entitled to use?.? ?
What meaningful progress have we made after 22 long years? Under Clause 23(2) of this Act by Gazette No: 1,4657/15 dated October 17, 2006, the Ministry of Social Services promulgated a very comprehensive detailed set of Regulationsclearly stipulating: Design and Space Requirements and Safety Measures to be adopted in the Construction of new buildings that are listed. These Regulations were then approved unanimously by our Parliament on March 20, 2007.? ?
Despite three extensions of the deadline by the Social Services Ministry and a comprehensive Circular dated October 4, 2012 under reference MSSS/7/8/ACC to all Ministries by the Secretary to the Ministry of Social Services, compliance with these Regulations has still not been achieved even after 12 years.
A proliferation of Buildings, Facilities and Places, especially in the Megapolis area, are being completed either new or after major renovations.? ?
Yet, key places and facilities, especially Toilets and Wash Facilities, Steps and Railings, Signage, Ramps and Entrances, fail to comply with specifications and requirements stipulated by the Laws.? ?
The Buildings and Places recognised by the existing Laws and are concerned here include Hospitals, Hotels and Restaurants, places of Education and Higher Education, Supermarkets and Shopping complexes, ATM Machines, Sports Stadia including at international venues and a large number of office buildings including those belonging to Ministries and Chief Ministers.? ?
It?s Now - or - Never
In recognising the resulting colossal losses that affect a wide range of people, this writer invoked the fundamental rights jurisdiction of the Supreme Court in 2009.? ?
The order was given by this Apex Court on April 27, 2011 indicates: compliance with it is mandatory for all buildings and Parts as identified by the Accessibility Regulations, and constructed new, requiring Authorities to Issue Certificate of Conformity.
Yet, the Regulatory Authorities since April 2011 have continuously failed to ensure compliance before issuing Certificate of Conformity.? ?
Construction companies obtain Certificates-of Conformity in the absence of due compliance well.? ?
Compliance with design specifications that take into consideration human safety is a low cost and feasible indispensable investment bringing rich dividends to everyone in society. Embracing Diversity is a Win-Win situation for Business.? ?
The colossal waste and the threat to the safety and human life caused by the failure to comply with Regulations and Court Orders is huge compared to the money needed.? ?
In a jail in one?s own country?
Safely accessible and usable built environments are essential for the dis-Abled people to integrate into the community and advocate their rights.? ?
It is crucial to arrest soon this vicious circle of Non-Compliance - it is now or never! If not, what is sure to result?? ?
Poor access to buildings that are essential in daily life, to education, to social and recreational facilities, no access to public transportation, poor access to the job facilities, loss of earning chances causing increasing unwanted dependency, poverty and segregation will also continue rampantly.? ?
The Government of Sri Lanka has embarked on an ambitious plan of development, specifically within the Western Province, which would result in a very significant number of new buildings and places ? the types that are indicated in Regulations - the public will need to access and use in daily life, being constructed at a rapid pace.? ?
Poor access to buildings that are essential in daily life, to education, to social and recreational facilities, no access to public transportation, poor access to the job facilities, loss of earning chances causing increasing unwanted dependency, poverty and segregation will also continue rampantly
This development is long-term projects and is inextricably entwined with the future of the next several generations of Sri Lankans.? ?
With such adverse trend prolonging, we reasonably fear that if such mega-development projects are not regulated adequately without further delay the next generation of persons suffering from inevitable mobility impediments - numbers of whom will be much larger than at present ? will be prevented from freely accessing and using the facilities therein at a wide range of new buildings and enjoying this next phase of development of Sri Lanka.? ?
Back-Peddling of the UN Convention (CRPD)
Based on a proposal made by the Social Services Minister, which was then unanimously approved by the Cabinet of Ministers, on February 8, 2016, the GoSL ratified the International Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UNCRPD).? ?
Promises were then given of State recognition to the ability and contributions made by the dis-Abled people (Article 8), a meaningful realization of Article 12.1 of our own Constitution for Citizens with Disabilities ? Right to Equality. 30 months has passed but nothing yet has resulted - even to meaningfully explore ways and means of expediting implementation!? ?
UNCRPD is a legally binding agreement with comprehensive protection of the rights of persons with disabilities, which requires a commitment by each ratifying State for its implementation.? ?
UNCRPD states clearly, the ratifying states should not discriminate against persons with disabilities and sets out with greater clarity the obligations on States indicating the steps that must be taken, to promote, protect and ensure enjoying their rights, especiallyenabling environments so that dis-Abled persons start enjoying meaningful real equality in Society.? ?
For example, the Convention requires States to take measures to ensure accessibility of the physical environment and information and communications technology, prohibit discrimination and achieve equality for all.? ?
The International Community, the UN in particular, who are much concerned about several other rights in this part of the world, in their actions, regretfully, appears to have overlooked the world?s largest minority ? the People with dis-Abilities - and allow Countries such as Sri Lanka to remain stuck at CRPD?s birth itself for so?.. long, as 30 months, without promoting actively to start them even crawling in the right direction.? ?
We wonder for how long the custodians of CRPD, the United Nations would allow a State after its ratification, to keep prolonging implementation, even without making a genuine start with easy to implement Clauses that do not require any new legislation or added costs, such as Articles 8 and 9.? ?
Prolonging will set a bad example to other nations? ?
A committed deadline for full enforcement, enabling the dis-Abled to start enjoying their enshrined rights, - the ultimate LONG AWAITED end-result ? is a prerequisite.
If there is a commitment that is sincere to ensure Sri Lanka?s largest minority will enjoythe desired results ? as some Nations have done to expedite matters and deliver the results without further delay - why cannot we present the CRPD as it is to the Parliament and get its approval, and thereby enable implementation to be legally binding?
Remember, a genuine effort here with a vision to move ahead on fast track, would also afford a low cost feasible fine opportunity to enhance Sri Lanka?s Human Rights Image.

Angry ETI protestors surround CMC looking for ETI Director
	
A tense situation erupted today at the Colombo Municipal Council premises, when depositors of the ETI Finance Limited (ETI) who were demanding their deposits back, gathered to show their displeasure to CMC Councillor Anjalee Deepa Edirisinghe, who is also a Director of ETI Company.
Speaking to the Daily Mirror, the Independent Association to Protect the ETI Depositors President Anusha Jayanthi said the Councillor was a member of the CMC Standing Committee on Poverty Alleviation, yet justice was not served to the depositors.
She said the ETI management paid them 20 per cent of their deposits and promised to pay another ten per cent however, remained silent over repaying of the remaining 70 per cent of their deposits.
The protestors claimed that ETI Directress Deepa Edirisinghe was continuously absent for meetings between the Directors of the Company and the Depositors and avoiding them.
They said that the meeting to restructure the ETI Finance was scheduled for today, however, was postponed in the final minute as the Directress was attending the CMC monthly council meeting.
Informed sources told that the Directress had fled the scene after the crowd entered the CMC grounds.
Police security was provided to the CMC during the protest. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)
