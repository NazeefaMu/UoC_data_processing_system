US State Dept. has deal with Analytica
	

WASHINGTON, AFP March20, 2018 -The US State Department has a $500,000 contract with the British analysis firm facing allegations it misused Facebook user data and offered to dig dirt on its international clients election opponents. 
A State Department official told AFP on Monday the agencys Global Engagement Center has a contract with Strategic Communications Laboratories (SCL) Group, the parent company of under-fire Cambridge Analytica. 
The agency has no business with CA, but SCL is closely tied to its offshoot and Facebook announced last week that it was suspending both, under the title SCL/Cambridge Analytica, from its platform.
 
Analyzing the online profile of suspected jihadists and sympathizers and then micro-targeting them for counterpropaganda would be exactly the kind of work that the data-mining firm SCL was set up to do.

A cop who refused to bend
	

The cremation of Ven. Daranagama Kusaladhamma Nayake Thera was held recently at the Independence Square with state honours. However, the organizers had initially planned to erect the funeral pyre in another section of the Square.

The construction work on the funeral pyre was underway when suddenly a top khaki-uniformed one had showed up and told the organizers that they should not erect the pyre at the site they had chosen.
Perturbed over this unexpected order, a former army chief who was a member of the organizing committee had made an appeal in vain to the cop concerned to allow the work on the funeral pyre to proceed. Later he had spoken to an officer of a higher rank and the cop concerned had refused to heed the latters request too.
So finally the organizers were compelled to shift the pyre to another site on the Independence Square, they say.

A dark horse in the race
	

With the no confidence motion taking centre-stage again, a race for the Number Two office has begun, they say.

The runners this time round are from the Blue party.
This is a new development for in the Blue party there was only one in the running for the coveted Number Two office for a long time; he was none other than the senior- most one from Badulla and even the JO group out of respect for his seniority in the party had made no objection to his credentials, they say.
The new aspirant to this office from the Blue party is a gabby senior from the central hills who had to make it to Diyawanna through the charity list last time. It was generally accepted that he lost his seat at the 2015 general polls because of his stand against the former strongman and this fact had worked in his favour when compiling the partys charity list, they say.
Now a top team member deeply involved in a poverty alleviation programme, this politicos name is often mentioned in political circles in connection with the Number Two office expected to fall vacant in the near future.

A desperate bid to stage a comeback
	

While the various snags in the way of constituting the new local bodies being cleared, picking heads and deputies to the local bodies won with decisive majorities have become a big headache to the main political parties, they say.

According to all present indications, picking a member for the deputy chair of the Colombo MC has posed not only a big problem to the party leadership, but also a potential threat to the party unity as well. A Green party heavyweight with a strong vote base in the city is said to have demanded that his nominee be offered the deputy chair in the city council pointing out that of the party members elected to the council, about 20 were his faithfuls. Remember, I am in a position to tilt the balance of power in the council the way I want. Therefore, offer the deputy office to my nominee, he had told the party leadership and had added: By the way, I want my due place in the government restored without further delay.
The Green heavyweight had later bragged that if the party continued to ignore him and his demands, he would get at least 18 Green members to sit in the opposition when the city council meets for the inaugural session.
However, the Green leadership continues to turn a deaf ear to the Green heavyweights demands, they say.

A story about a stink
	

This is a very unusual story about a head of a statutory body. Employees in his main office hate to go near him. And its a nightmarish experience for the directors to sit with him at board meetings. It is not because this bigwig is fierce or menacing, bad-tempered and given to tantrums either. It is because the odor exuding from his body is so awful and nauseating!

Some inquisitive ones who had made discreet inquiries had found the reason for the boss body odor; he does not take a bath for weeks and what is worse is that he wears the same dress for days.
Given the sensitivity of the matter, the directors would not dare tell their boss about their problem of dealing with official matters seated close to him. However, some of them had tried to convey the message to him in subtle ways with no success so far, they say.
The directors have seriously considered bringing their problem to the notice of the top team member responsible for overseeing the statutory body. But they have come across a discouraging snag; the bigwig and the top team member are reportedly thick pals!
The biggest irony, they say, is that the statutory body that this smelling bigwig is heading is responsible for supplying something he hardly uses - precious water!

National Police Commission (NPC) Secretary Ariyadasa Cooray was removed due to the influence of some political leaders, who intended to prevent a comprehensive report from being compiled on the recent unrests in Theldeniya and Digana, the Campaign for Free and Fair Elections (CaFFE) and Centre for Human Rights and Research (CHR) accused.
CaFFE and CHR Executive Director Keerthi Tennakoon said Ariyadasa Cooray was removed because he had asked Inspector General of Police (IGP) Pujith Jayasundara to submit a full report on the recent incidents occurred in Theldeniya and Digana.
It is a public secret that the recent violent activities were aggravated due to the inefficiency of the Police. It was publicly revealed by some prominent ministers like Lakshman Kiriella, Rauff Hakeem and Dilum Amunugama that these incidents could have been mitigated if the Police personnel were deployed in a proper manner, he said.(Sheain Fernandopulle)

Assault on bus driver; Media presented only one-sided story: Kasun
	
Southern Provincial Councillor M.K. Kasun, who is under remand custody over the alleged assault on a bus driver, making a special speech at the Southern Council meeting on Tuesday said that the media had presented only one side of the story that had misleadingly portrayed him as an underworld figure.
After arriving at Tuesdays council meeting with Prison security officers, he said the people ought to question whether a firearm had been given to him by the Council for his protection, or to be locked up in a safe.
The Councillor, who appeared very emotional while speaking, said he was glad that a number of his fellow Councillors had agreed with his views.
Councillor Kasun said of the incident:
I was returning from Malabe to Colombo that day. The car park at Odel is located on the ground floor. My vehicle was heading towards the ground floor when I heard someone honking his horn. I noticed it was from the vehicle behind mine, and so I went forward and stopped the vehicle.
The driver of a bus which had just alighted approached me from the right. The conductor approached from the left, where my wife was seated. He asked me why I had driven forward and assaulted me. I was injured, later requiring four stitches on my lip. I could not do anything to defend myself, so I got out of my car and struck the driver.
Then, onlookers joined in and assaulted me with helmets and other items they could pick up from the site.
Kasun said his wife could no longer witness the assault on her husband without intervening and took the gun given to him by the Provincial Council from the glove compartment of his car.
The Councillor stated: This [weapon] was given to me [by the Council]. Instead of showing the entire incident, video footage only shows her carrying the weapon. We were remanded on charges of assault on the driver and for using a firearm. Its important to question whether this weapon was given to keep locked in a safe, or for an emergency like this, which had arisen where my life was threatened
The Councillor claimed the bus which runs on route 177 between Kollupitiya and Kaduwela belongs to an underworld gang leader.
My father was killed fifteen years ago within the Colombo High-Security Zone. My wife who was present during my incident took maximum steps to defend. Due to this, she is now suffering in remand. Im asking for justice and call upon all to reveal the truth.
At this point, Council Member Nalin Hewage (JVP) spoke.
Nalin Hewage (JVP): Mr Chairman, five of us have not obtained firearms. Prior to this incident, we were unaware that firearms had been given to all the other members. Therefore, we request a list of the members, who have been provided with firearms as we five are the only unarmed, while the other fifty are armed.
Why do peoples representatives require firearms If there is an issue about security, get a security officer. Take back these firearms and set up a security system instead.
The Chairman: Firearms have been given by the Ministry of Defence only to Councillors on request and not to all individuals.
Nalin Hewage: Why is there a need for firearms for certain council members We [JVP members] too travel by buses.
Sampath Athukorale (UPFA): The need for firearms exists in light of incidents from history because of certain people.
Ashoka Danawansa (UNP): I have not obtained a firearm.
Discussion intensified as Hewage continued to state peoples representatives need not be armed and members of the Joint Opposition attempted to prevent him speaking further.
The Chairman postponed the session for fifteen minutes as he could no longer control the session. (D.G. Sugathapala and Sumathipala Diyagahage)

Bond scam - first case by new HC-at-Bar: Talatha
	
The bond scam could be the first case to be heard by the new High Court-at-Bar which the government intends to set up, Minister of Justice Talatha Athukorala told Parliament yesterday.
Some MPs have talked much about the bond scam and what I could say that this could be the first case which the new high courts could hear, Ms Athukorala said.
She said the government is not prepared to follow wrong precedents created by the last regime and drag people to jail. The Minister said that this is the answer the government could give to those who question on the action it had taken to curb corruption. We will always do things within a legal framework, she said.
The Minister said some people are so ignorant that they think the Minister of Justice could get involved in court cases when a number of such cases are given to her. Some MPs came up with some case numbers today and I would say that they hardly know the duties and functions of Justice Minister. Ministers job is not getting involved in court cases and could manipulate them, she said. (Yohan Perera)

The captain of the Government should take the responsibility when it was defeated in an election, just like the way a captain of the Sri Lankan cricket team was responsible for its defeats, Minister of Sports Dayasiri Jayasekera said today.
Minister Jayasekera said this in response to an oral question raised by MP Rohini Wijeratne in Parliament last afternoon.
Ms Wijeratne questioned as to who should be blamed for the defeat of Sri Lankan Cricket Team in recent matches.
Is it you or the SLC Chief or is it the team, who is responsible the MP questioned.
The Minister then answered saying the captain has to take the blame.
However, we managed to win some matches after the new coach took over. We cant win every time but one must remember that team also wins games. This is the usual situation as you win and you lose he said. (Yohan Perera and Ajith Siriwardana)

China urges US to not act emotionally  on trade
	

Chinese Premier Li Keqiang called on the United States Tuesday to not act emotionally and to avoid a trade war, as President Donald Trump considers new punitive measures against Beijing. 
After announcing tariffs on global steel and aluminium imports, Trump is now mulling new actions against China over its theft of US intellectual property. 
Washington has long accused Beijing of forcing US companies to turn over proprietary commercial information and intellectual property as a condition of operating in China. 
But Li pledged that China will strictly protect intellectual property rights. 
US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer recently proposed a package of $30 billion in tariffs on China but Trump wants it to go higher, according to US media.  The US trade deficit with China ran to a record $375 billion last year -- but US exports to the country were also at a record.  Nobody will emerge as a winner from a trade war, Li told a press conference after the countrys annual parliament session. 
We hope that both parties can maintain reason, not act emotionally, and avoid a trade war, said Li, who was given a second five-year term by the National Peoples Congress on Sunday. -AFP

Glyphosate ban: Rathana Thera ready to join JO to fight against it
	
While claiming that the decision to topple the Government was taken by the people, Parliamentarian Athuraliye Rathana Thera said today he was ready to join, even with the Joint Opposition to fight against any moves to remove the ban of Glyphosate..
Ven. Rathana Thera told parliament that decisions on the Glyphosate should not be taken on the need of the American Company.
"Minister Navin Dissanayake submitted a Cabinet paper to remove the Glyphosate ban in Sri Lanka. And a committee comprising Minister Rajitha Senaratne and Susil Premajayantha was appointed on this. We do not know who appointed this Where is the report of this committee.
A US citizen cannot decide whether to remove the ban," he said.
The matter cropped up in Parliament when Minister Eran Wickremaratne replied to a question raised by UNP MP Thushara Idunil over different views on the use of Glyphosate.
Mr. Wickremaratne said there was no scientific evidence to prove that Glyphosate led to kidney diseases according to findings of a scientist at the Peradeniya University, Buddhi Marambe.
He said the Government could not be toppled on matters like this, in reply to a claim by MP Idunil that some were planning to topple the Government over this.
Ven. Rathana Thera, who responded, said that more than 100 world-renowned scientists such as Ranil Senanayake and Priyani Paranagama had submitted a report to the President on the danger of using Glyphosate and asked is Mr. Marambe the only scientist in the country.
"Toppling of Government is decided by the people. If the JO supported me in the fight against this, I am ready to join them," he said.
JO MP Dinesh Gunawardane said the country was more important than the American Company and that they were ready to support Rathana Therain this matter. (Ajith Siriwardana and Yohan Perera)

GTF-GSLF debate on sidelines of UNHRC session
	
One of the side events organised by the Global Tamil Forum (GTF) to coincide with the UNHRC's 37th session in Geneva was called off midway following a heated argument between GTF and Global Sri Lankans Forum (GSLF) representatives on Monday, sources said.
Two side events organised by the GTF and the GSLF were held on Monday with the objective of making the international community aware of the progress made by the Sri Lankan government with regard to reconciliation.
The GTF event was also attended by GSLF representatives. At this event, GTF members including representative Paul Newman accused the government of overpopulating Trincomalee with Sinhala people and accused the Sinhalese of massacring Muslims.
Responding to these charges, GSLF representative Nalaka Godahewa said it was the LTTE which in 1990 had ordered the Muslims to vacate the Jaffna Peninsula within 48 hours and the LTTE had massacred hundreds of Muslims.
"The LTTE also killed 147 Muslims who were praying inside a mosque in Kattankudi in 1990. Sinhalese don't complain about the increasing Tamil population in Wellawatta during the past 100 years. Any person belonging to any community can live anywhere in Sri Lanka," he said.
When GTF representatives had attempted to obstruct the GSLF speakers, the GSLF members had retaliated.
GSLF Co-President of Israel Janith Wimala said the international community which shed crocodile tears over the killing of Tamils, was silent the Sinhalese were killed.
Sources said several GSLF members including Wasantha Keerthirathna, Kumari Muahndiram and Nimala Liyanapatabendi took part in the debate held afterwards and the GTF had ended it midway without responding to GSLF allegations.(Lahiru Pothmulla)

The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) recently said that it would continue to support Sri Lanka to achieve development goals including the areas of nuclear medicine, non-destructive testing in industry and assistance in introducing nuclear energy.
IAEA Director General Yukiya Amano expressed these views during his visit to Sri Lanka on March 14.
While joining the Minister of Power and Renewable Energy Ranjith Siyambalapitiya at the inauguration of the new offices of the Sri Lanka Atomic Energy Board, Mr Amano was informed of the progress the country has achieved in applying nuclear techniques for development.
He reiterated the IAEAs continued assistance in capacity building in this advanced technology; The inclusion of nuclear power as a possible option for electricity generation by 2030 is a key element in Sri Lankas Long-Term Generation Expansion Plan 2015-2034, he added.
He met State Minister of Foreign Affairs Vasantha Senanayake and State Minister of Power and Renewable Energy Ajith P. Perera and discussed key areas of Agency support when establishing important institutes such as the Sri Lankan Gamma Centre, the National Centre for Non- Destructive Testing and the Nuclear Medicine Unit at University of Peradeniya was covered.
Minister Perera explained that in the area of non-destructive testing, Sri Lanka has built significant experience of over two decades and its companies provide inspection services to both the public and private sector.
The IAEA has played an important role in helping Sri Lanka promote these technologies, particularly radiographic testing, the Minister said.

James Packer: Billionaire quits Crown Resorts over mental health
	
Australian billionaire James Packer has resigned as a director of his casino empire Crown Resorts Limited.
The businessman is "suffering from mental health issues", a spokesman for his private investment company said.
Mr Packer, 50, rejoined the board of Crown in August after stepping down in 2015 as chairman and director.
The Australia-listed company thanked Mr Packer, one of the nation's richest people, in a brief statement on Wednesday.
"We have appreciated James' contribution to the board and respect his decision to step down from his role as director at this time," executive chairman John Alexander said.
A spokesman for Mr Packer's Consortium Press Holdings, Crown's largest shareholder, said the magnate "intends to step back from all commitments".
Earlier this month, Mr Packer sold more than A$100m ($76m; 55m) worth of Crown shares. He retains a dominant stake of about 47% in the company, which owns casinos in Australia and London.
He had only rejoined Crown's board last year after the company exited its Macau and US investments, and switched its focus back to Australia.
It followed the jailing of 16 Crown employees in China for illegally promoting gambling.
His resignation comes after a tumultuous period for the billionaire, who was caught up in a scandal involving Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu last month.
Israel's Channel 10 reported in December that Mr Packer told investigators he gave the prime minister and his wife Sara gifts.
Mr Packer's high-profile split from singer Mariah Carey in 2016 also gained wide public attention, as did his street brawl with an Australian TV executive in 2014.
Mr Packer is Australia's eighth-richest person with an estimated fortune of A$4bn ($3.1bn; 2.2bn), according to Forbes.(BBC)

Last male  northern white rhino dies in Kenya
	

Kenya, (Daily Mail), 20 March 2018 - The last male northern white rhino has died in Kenya at the age of 45, leaving only two females of his subspecies alive.
The rhino, named Sudan, was suffering from a degenerative muscle and bone condition linked to age when keepers found he was unable to stand up and made the decision to euthanise him on Tuesday.
Sudans demise should spell the end of his subspecies, but scientists have gathered genetic material and hope to develop IVF techniques to produce more white rhinos.A statement from the Ol Pejeta Conservancy, where he was kept under armed guard to prevent poaching, said his condition worsened significantly and he was no longer able to stand. 
His muscles and bones had degenerated and his skin had extensive wounds, with a deep infection on his back right leg.
The rhino had been part of an ambitious effort to save the subspecies from extinction after decades of decimation by poachers, with the help of the two surviving females. 
One is his daughter, Najin, and the other is her daughter, Fatu.

153 million air pollution deaths a year are preventable
	

(Daily Mail), 19 March 2018 - As many as 153 million deaths linked to air pollution worldwide this century could be prevented if governments speed up timetables for reducing fossil fuel emissions. 
That is the claim of a new study which looked at the numbers of people in urban areas whose lives could be saved if temperature increases are limited to 1.5C (2.7F). 
The study is the first to project these numbers on a city by city basis, in 154 of the worlds largest urban areas.  In New York, Los Angeles, Moscow, Mexico City and Sao Paolo alone, between 320,000 and 120,000 premature deaths would be prevented in each city. 
Researchers say the study shows why politicians and governments should act swiftly to bring down carbon emissions. 
Researchers from Duke University ran computer simulations of future emissions of carbon dioxide and associated pollutants, such as ozone and particulate matter, under three different scenarios.  These scenarios simulated an overall increase in emissions resulting in warming of 2C (3.6F) by 2100, accelerated reductions of carbon emissions, and even further reductions limiting atmospheric warming to 1.5C (2.7F). 
They matched this data with computer models, based on decades of public health data on air-pollution related deaths, to work out which areas would be the hardest hit by global warming.

In the meantime, several mediators had gone into action and a flurry of talks between the two factions that ensued had led to reaching the agreement sought.
Now they have begun signing the motion. Even one JO member from Gampaha and two of the three Blue ones from the government side who initially opposed the move had later signed the motion under much pressure, they say. According to the latest report, the JO has been assured of ayes from all in the Blue faction with the government except the one from a young heavyweight from Rajarata.

Thus while improving the quality of life, reforestation also aids in the process of absorbing pollution and dust in the air, rebuilding habitat as well as the eco system and most importantly in the prevention of global warming.
In this endeavor Multi Finance PLC will endorse and extend an opportunity to all its clientele and stakeholders to plant 10 trees, with every transaction carried out with the company. Further company intends to include renowned corporates and well-wishers in raising funds for the Each One Plant One campaign. Whereby every citizen of Sri Lanka receives an opportunity to take part in future reforestation campaigns, which will be seamlessly integrated with the companys future growth.
Reforestation Sri Lanka and the Rainforest Protectors of Sri Lanka will carry out the maintenance of the project under the patronage of Multi Finance PLC. The two stakeholder movements will be involved in the identification of suitable locations and the selection of saplings to be planted. Thus ensuring that all necessary procedures are followed in order to ensure the healthy growth of the saplings.
Our team will engage wholeheartedly along with the Fairway group to make this project a landmark event in Sri Lanka. Our plan is to increase the Sri Lankas forest cover from the alarming low level it is today to the expected cover of 32%, contributing to the reduction of the world carbon foot print and to prevent natural disasters taking place in our country. The entire progression of the campaign can be monitored through the Multi Finance PLC website and the project will entail tree planting and maintenance, stated Mr.Pushpike Jayasundera, the CEO of Multi Finance PLC.
Forests are the lungs of our Earth, yet we are losing them at an alarming rate. Multi Finance PLC invites all citizens to join hands in their historic endeavor, the Each One Plant One sustainability campaign and all future projects to come, thereby playing a valuable role in the rejuvenation and security of Sri Lankas forest cover.
This endeavor undisputedly, will ensure a greener future for the entire nation and generations to come.

Peeking into uncertain future
	

Two politically significant events said to be in the offing  moving a no confidence motion against Number Two and another reshuffle of the top team have become the subjects of much discourse in political circles these days. Meanwhile, government high-ups have begun breathing fire at their own bosses. Fast developing political instability and uncertainty about their own political future appear to have highly shaken almost all high authorities in yahapalanaya. This is a time most of them look up to divine grace and seek the help of occultists to take a peek into their uncertain political future.

It has come to light that at least three Green party bigwigs had approached an astrologer cum soothsayer holding a high political office in a certain province to get a reading of their horoscope relevant to the ongoing period. They had reportedly sought a specific answer to their query whether they would lose the high office they were holding now.
The astrologer, a lady with a wide reputation, had given them a straight answer to their common question.
All three of them had appealed to her to keep as a secret her knowledge about their political future as foreseen by her.
One of these top team members is from Uva, and the other two are from Wayamba and West respectively, they say.

A mechanism for reparations, another major component of the UNHRC Resolution adopted in 2015, is to be presented to Parliament next month, Chairman of the Committee appointed to set up the mechanism and Secretary to the President Austin Fernando said today.
The paper submitted for Cabinet approval a little over two weeks ago was now before the legal draftsman to ensure its Constitutionality, Fernando said at an event held in Colombo.
We hope to present the bill to Parliament soon, he said.
Speaking of the Governments efforts at reconciliation, Fernando said that infrastructure alone was insufficient if the country was to be successful in its efforts.
It is not just the diplomats and the politicians who should work for this it has to be everyone, he said.
The event held at the Taj Samudra Hotel launched a multifaceted programme supporting the reconciliation programme in Sri Lanka. The Rs. 2.7 billion project aims to strengthen institutions at national and sub-national levels as well as promote public engagement in policymaking.
Implemented by the Deutsche Gesellschaft fr Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GiZ) and the British Council, the project will be a collaborative effort between the Ministry of Co-existence, Dialogue, and Official Languages, the Office for National Unity and Reconciliation (ONUR), as well as other relevant line Ministries and civil society organizations over four years.
The primary focus of the programme is to track progress on national reconciliation, facilitate learning and strengthen institutions at a national and sub-national level as well as promote public engagement in policymaking.
The programme will contribute to dealing with the past memorialization, strengthening mental health and psychosocial care, and using art and culture as a medium to promote reconciliation.
As a means to help address challenges identified by the Government of Sri Lanka, the programme will lay emphasis on reducing language barriers in order to provide better public services. Some of the key outputs of the programme is a mobile museum and theatre in 35 locations reaching up to 350,000 people, 6,000 clients accessing mental health and psychosocial support services, a minimum of 300 media personnel and cultural actors trained in arts and culture, aiming to reach a minimum audience of 4-5 million, 1,200 public officers receiving language training, including the Police, court officials and health workers.

Samsung Galaxy S9 and S9+: Reimagining the way we connect and share our lives
	
Shantha Fernando - General Manager Head of Mobile Business, Samsung Sri Lanka, Ranjan Perera - Managing Director/Sector, Head Mobile Business, Softlogic Mobile Distribution (Pvt) Ltd, Sagara Lakmal De Mel - Television Director / Photographer, Christina Peiris - Top 16 Miss Universe - Miss Universe Sri Lanka 2017, Hanbae Park - Managing Director, Samsung Sri Lanka, Janoda Thoradeniya - CEO of John Keells Office Automation (Pvt) Ltd

The eagerly-awaited Samsung Galaxy S9 and S9+, from Samsung Electronics will now be available in Sri Lanka. The two latest models have reimagined the way people communicate, share and experience the world by providing all the features youve ever wished for in your smartphone but never had. Understanding consumers need to share, communicate and express themselves more with images, videos and emojis, the Galaxy S9 and S9+ drive innovation with Samsungs advanced camera. Redesigned with a new Dual Aperture lens that powers an innovative low light camera, Super Slow-mo video capabilities and personalized AR Emoji, the Galaxy S9 and S9+ ensure users do not miss a moment and make their everyday epic.

HanBae Park - Managing Director of Samsung Sri Lanka said In an age where individualism is constantly being expressed through images, emojis and video content, we have reimagined a smartphone for the future, with the Samsung Galaxy S9 and S9 +. Samsung Sri Lanka recently won Peoples Youth Choice brand of the year award which reflects the growing popularity of Samsung amongst the people of Sri Lanka. I am grateful to all our consumers for their vote of trust which has led us to win this award. Leading the market as Sri Lankas No. 01 brand, our aim is to empower Sri Lankans to do what you cant, today.

Hanbae Park - Managing Director, Samsung Sri Lanka unveiling the phone

The Galaxy S9 and S9+ deliver an enhanced entertainment experience with powerful stereo speakers tuned by AKG, immersive audio with Dolby Atmos and a refined edge-to-edge Infinity Display a key staple in Samsungs design heritage.

Camera Reimagined
Todays cameras are for more than taking pictures  they are for connecting and communicating. Consumers want a smartphone camera with state-of-the-art technology, so they can express themselves with high-quality images and tools to tell their own, unique story. The Galaxy S9 and S9+ cameras are built with these consumers in mind, with a Super Speed Dual Pixel sensor with dedicated processing power and memory to take amazing shots with high photo quality. The Galaxy S9 and S9+s camera features include:

Super Slow-mo: Make every day moments epic with dynamic, slow-motion video that captures 960 frames per second. The Galaxy S9 and S9+ also offer automatic Motion Detection, an intelligent feature that detects movement in the frame and automatically begins to record  all users have to do is set up the shot. After capturing the Super Slow-mo video, users can select background music from 35 different options or add a tune from their favourite playlist. Users can also easily create, edit and share GIF files with a simple tap in three playful styles of looping to watch the action over and over again.

Images from the Experiencing Zone

Low Light Camera: Good lighting is the secret to any great photo. But often, photos are taken in less-than-ideal lighting conditions and most smartphone cameras have a fixed aperture that cant adjust to low or bright lighting environments resulting in grainy or washed out pictures. Similar to the way the iris of a human eye expands and contracts, Samsungs Dual Aperture (F1.5 / F2.4) automatically lets in more light when its dark and less light when its too bright, taking photos that are crisp and clear.

AR Emoji: Samsung lets users create an emoji that looks, sounds and acts like them. AR Emoji uses a data-based machine learning algorithm, which analyses a 2D image of the user and maps out more than 100 facial features to create a 3D model that reflects and imitates expressions, like winks and nods, for true personalization. AR Emoji shares users real-life emotions not only in video but also with a range of stickers and uses a standard AGIF file format so users can share their emojis across most third-party messaging platforms.

Bixby: Samsungs intelligence platform, integrated into the camera, uses augmented reality and deep learning technologies to provide helpful information about a users surroundings. With real-time object detection and recognition, Bixby instantly generates information directly on top of the image that the camera is pointing at. Users can translate foreign languages and currency in real time with Live Translation, learn about their surroundings, purchase products seen in the real world and track calories throughout the day.

Entertainment Reimagined
Smartphones are often our go-to choice for entertainment, which is why Samsung created a device that offers premium sound experiences with stereo speakers tuned by AKG. Whether users are watching their favourite movie or streaming their favourite artists latest album, sounds are clear, crisp and rich in quality. The Galaxy S9 and S9+ also support Dolby Atmos, giving the effect of 360-degree sound.

The Galaxy S9 and S9+ audio experience is complemented by Samsungs revolutionary Infinity Display. First introduced on the Galaxy S8, the bold, bright Super AMOLED Infinity Display blends right into the phone with virtually no distracting notches. With adaptive contrast enhancement, users can use their device even in direct sunlight.

For those constantly on the move, the next-generation Samsung DeX empowers a mobile lifestyle by bringing a large, full-screen experience to the mobile handset. With the DeX Pad, a new docking system, users can easily connect the Galaxy S9 and S9+ to a larger monitor, keyboard and mouse to expand the mobile experience with enhanced document editing or even full-screen gaming. Users can also transform the Galaxy S9 and S9+ into a Touch Pad with the DeX Pad.

The Best Comes Standard with the Galaxy Foundation
Samsung sets the gold standard for smartphones with IP68 water and dust resistance and wireless charging and goes a step beyond with the Galaxy S9 and S9+. The devices now support expandable memory of up to 400GB with a Micro SD Card and are equipped with the latest premium application processors offering powerful performance and sophisticated image processing.

In addition, the Galaxy S9 and S9+ give users the peace of mind knowing that their phone is protected by Knox 3.1, Samsungs latest defense - grade security platform. The Galaxy S9 and S9+ support three different biometric authentication options  iris, fingerprint, and facial recognition  so users can choose the way they want to protect their device and applications. The devices feature Intelligent Scan, a new verification that intelligently uses the collective strength of iris scanning and facial recognition technology to quickly and conveniently unlock a users phone in various situations. The Galaxy S9 and S9+ also introduce Dedicated Fingerprint, giving users the option to use a different fingerprint to access Secure Folder than the one used to unlock the phone.

SLIEOA Intensifies Trade Union Action
	
The Sri Lankan Immigration and Emigration Officers Association (SLIEOA) yesterday launched a trade union action in response to the failure of the government to provide a resolution to their demands.
President of the SLIEOA, Aruna Kanugala said the association made its grievances known six months earlier at a press conference. He stated the problems officers face have not been addressed for almost two decades.
The associations key demands are for an approved service minute, the re-establishment of the prosecution department of the immigration department and the deployment of officers to foreign missions abroad.
As part of the protests, officers are displaying banners and distributing pamphlets to raise awareness of the unions grievances at the immigration counters at the departure terminals of Mattala and Katunayake Airports, all harbours and the posts at the Department of Immigration and Emigration Head Office in Battaramulla ordinarily attended to by the immigration and emigration officers. The SLIEO has however assured the public that there would be no interruption to services at any of these counters during the protest.
Mr Kanugala explained that one of the SLIEOAs key requests, the establishment of a service minute, is necessary for smooth and steady recruitment. Service minutes outline the qualifications a person must have to be appointed as an officer, the opportunities for career progression and the procedures involved in recruitment and promotion. Service minutes need to be approved by the cabinet. Currently, the majority of public service sector professions have them.
Right now, most officers retire from the same position they were hired to, Mr Kanugala stated, There are no opportunities for career progression and as a result, there is no motivation for people to develop.
Mr Kanugala stated that if a resolution was not provided, the next step would be to distribute information at the arrival terminals of the airport - an action the SLIEO states it has refrained from taking so far to avoid tarnishing the image of Sri Lanka to foreigners arriving in the country - and strikes would be a last resort.

There was provocation for their protest
	

Number One who on an official visit to Nippon, got a jolt when a group of Sri Lankan Muslims domiciled in that country staged a demonstration opposite the hotel where he and his entourage checked in. It soon transpired the Muslim community had organized this demonstration to register their protest against the anti-Muslim riots that broke out in and around Kandy.

Number One immediately sent for the leaders of the demonstration and held a cordial discussion with them.
Later a group of Sinhalese including some members of the Presidential delegation and several Buddhist monks met the leaders of the Muslim community in that country expressed their surprise at their sudden protest action.
Then the Muslim leaders had replied: True, we wanted to express our concern over what happened in certain parts of the Kandy district. But what disturbed us most the news that a certain Buddhist monk leading an anti-Muslim militant organization has arrived in this country!

Thewarapperuma tenders resignation as organiser
	
Deputy Minister Palitha Thewarapperuma today tendered his resignation as Bulathsinhala Organiser of the United National Party (UNP), to Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.
In his resignation letter, the Deputy Minister stated the failure to obtain the votes in Bulathsinhala Pradeshiya Sabha at the recent Local Government (LG) Elections and the failure to get a good Police OIC to Bulathsinhala Police Station were among the main reasons behind his resignation.
Speaking to the Daily Mirror the Deputy Minister explained that though he fulfilled the duties as the Bulathsinhala Organiser he never accepted the appointment letter.
He said the Bulathsinhala seat consisted of majority Tamil population, therefore, request the Prime Minister to appoint a responsible person as the UNP organizer.
In his letter, he had also informed the Premier to take his Deputy Minister portfolio if his resignation as the UNP organiser was not enough. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

Thief, attacked by bees, made a hasty retreat minus his sarong
	
A thief who had entered a poultry run in a Tea estate in Dumbara braving the rains to steal some fully grown fowls had to make a hasty retreat leaving his sarong behind, in the face of a severe attack by a swarm of bees which got disturbed.
The poultry run had been located in the back compound of a house, and the fowls which used to roam about from the early hours in the morning in search of food, normally return back at nightfall. A thief who had entered the poultry run breaking the door and had picked on some fully grown fowls and had put them inside a gunny bag he had brought with him. Despite the heavy rain and been happy over the catch, attempted to make a quick exit and in the rush, he had knocked against a wooden box full of bees. The impact aroused the bees which came in a swarm and attacked the intruder.
Being unable to resist the bee attack, the thief made a hasty retreat leaving the gunny bag with the fowls and in the rush, he forgot that he had exited the scene leaving his sarong behind. (Dammika Gunawardene)

UNF to rally round the PM to defeat no-faith motion
	
UNF ministers, state ministers, deputy ministers and parliamentarians, at a meeting with Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe in the chair, unanimously decided to confront and counter the JO-sponsored no-confidence motion against him, Cabinet Spokesman and Minister, Gayantha Karunatilaka said.
He said State Ministers Wasantha Senanayake and Palitha Range Bandara had also agreed to the decision arrived at and would vote against the motion if it was presented in Parliament.
Ministers Rajitha Senaratne and Champika Ranawaka raised this matter at yesterdays Cabinet meeting and underscored the fact that the government should not fall prey to the conspiracies hatched by the JO and collectively confront and counter them.
We are confident that the joint opposition will be unable able to collect the minimum number of 113 votes to pass the no-confidence motion. I personally feel they will not even get anywhere near, Minister Karunatilaka told Daily Mirror.
He said the three reports on the restructuring and reorganization of the UNP would be presented to the Working Committee this weekend and would be implemented with any amendments.
Meanwhile, a senior SLFP minister told Daily Mirror the no-confidence motion against Prime Minister Wickremesinghe might be handed over to Speaker Karu Jayasuriya today.
However, we are determined to protect Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, he said. (Sandun A Jayasekera)

UNP delegation meets President
	
A top-level UNP delegation, led by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe is reported to have had a closed-door meeting with President Maithripala Sirisena on Tuesday and discussed the political circumstances to be triggered by the No-confidence Motion.
According to political sources, the UNP had tried to find a way out of the current crisis situation. The President, at this moment, sounded concerned about the future of the Ministers of his party.
The President is reported to have given a patient hearing to the UNP. However, he did not commit anything at this juncture.
The Joint Opposition or the UPFA faction led by former President Mahinda Rajapaksa handed over the No-confidence Motion to Speaker Karu Jayasuriya. It also contained the signatures of four Ministers representing the UPFA in the government.
If the motion is won with a majority of votes, the Prime Minister has to step down.
Currently, the UNP has 106 seats in Parliament whereas the SLFP-led UPFA has only 95 members. Therefore, the UPFA has to muster the support of some UNPers or other parties in the Opposition to win the motion. (Kelum Bandara)

UNP would easily defeat the no-confidence motion: Rajitha
	
The UNP would easily defeat the No Confidence Motion (NCM) against Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, Cabinet spokesman, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said the party will take a decision on SLFP ministers who campaigned for the NCM and signed it.
The NCM containing 55 signatures was handed over to Speaker Karu Jayasuriya by JO leader Dinesh Gunawardana at the Speakers office. However, former President Mahinda Rajapaksa and several SLFP Ministers had not signed the motion, Speaker's office media release said.
Minister Senaratne added that even the SLFP Ministers themselves who talked for, campaigned and supported the NCM would see it difficult to remain in the Yahapalana Government Cabinet with Mr. Wickremesinghe as the Prime Minister.
Addressing the weekly Cabinet news briefing yesterday, Minister Senaratne said the Yahapalana Government came to power on a mandate given by the people not to continue the policies and schemes of the Mahinda Rajapaksa regime but to implement the policies and fulfil the pledges given by President Maithripala Sirisena, Prime Minister Wickremesinghe and the United National Front at two elections in 2015.
A number of SLFP Ministers campaigned for months and in particular after the LG polls to remove Mr. Wickremesinghe from the premiership that culminated by bringing a NCM against him. The problem is whether they could sit in the same Cabinet with Mr. Wickremesinghe as the head and with those who stood with Mr. Wickremesinghe right throughout. Therefore, we have no choice but to reconsider maintainability of a Cabinet with two groups of Ministers having extremely opposing and dissenting views, he said.
The Yahapalana Government did not intend to rule the country any further while Cabinet members quarrelling and criticizing each other and it is obvious that a different, more efficient, productive and results-oriented governance must be in place to meet the pledges given to the people in 2015.
As such, the UNP would work out a different administration and a political set up in the near future for the remaining period of the good governance. The UNP working committee will take the final decision on the new political set up shortly, Minister Senaratne emphasized. (Sandun A Jayasekera)

US closes in on sex slave operators  and human traffickers
	
Modern slavery and human trafficking have become the worlds third largest money spinning businesses and third fastest growing criminal industry. 
Although modern slavery and human trafficking have so far not plagued Sri Lanka, this has become a serious global issue. Unless quick action is taken to combat these issues, rescue the victims and bring the traffickers to book, the number of men, women and children that are trafficked and forced into commercial sexual exploitation and modern slavery would continue to rise.

According to International Labour Organization statistics, approximately 25 million adults and children globally are in forced labour, held in debt bondage and are working under slave-like conditions. 
This was revealed when foreign journalists had an audience with several high-profile US Government officials and non- governmental organizations in Washington DC, Houston TX and Los Angeles CA, recently. The tour was organized by the US Department of States. 
When the personally had interviews with Senior Officers from the Diplomatic Security- US Department of State, US Department of Homeland Security, US Department of Health and Human Services, US Department of Labour, Special Advisor to the Mayor of Houston and several non-profitable non-governmental organizations, it was brought to the notice how effectively they are rescuing the trafficking victims, providing them with medical care to overcome physical and psychological trauma they have undergone, rehabilitating them, providing shelter and their basic needs and even securing employment while the traffickers are brought to book and given the maximum punishment according to the crimes committed. 
According to an official from the Houston Task Force, the police alone cannot combat slavery and human trafficking without the extended support given by the non-profitable, non-governmental organizations to crackdown the menace they are now facing. They are of the view that the traffickers should hold criminally accountable for engaging in human trafficking and the law enforcement authorities should not impose suspended sentences, fines or administrative penalties in place of prison sentences. 
TREATED LIKE ANIMALS
The traffickers treat the victims not as humans, but like animals. Since trafficking is a money driven business, more and more who want to become rich without any hard work are getting involved in this racket. The biggest challenge we face is to find who the traffickers are, locate where adults and children are being held in slavery or sex exploitation and to rescue them. We give first priority to rescue the victims and get them out of danger and then arrest the traffickers and produce them for further legal action. The minimum prison sentence for sex trafficking is 15 years, the Houston Task Force official said. 
According to the US Department of State, the use of children in the commercial sex trade is a punishable offence and sex trafficking has brought devastated consequences for children including long lasting physical and psychological trauma, HIV/ AIDS, drug addiction, unwanted pregnancy, malnutrition, social ostracism andeven death. 

According to International Labour Organization statistics approximately 25 million adults and children globally are in forced labour
Once victims are identified they are assured of receiving the support and resources they need
Meanwhile, Acting Deputy Director, Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons (TIP Office) of US Department of States, Laura Svat Rundlet told the that Prosecution, Protection and Prevention (3P model) effectively help to combat human trafficking. We employ an array of tactful individuals to fight against human trafficking and to implement effective strategies to confront modern slavery. In the annual Trafficking in Persons Report we have analyzed whether all forms of human trafficking have been criminalized. Investigations are carried out vigorously, traffickers are prosecuted, they are convicted and made to realize what heinous crimes they have committed. Trafficking in persons, human trafficking and modern slavery are interchangeable. Sex trafficking, forced labour and unlawful recruitment and the use of child soldiers are among other various forms of human trafficking which all amount to a crime involving exploitation, the Acting Deputy Director said. 

According to her, once a victim is identified he/she is ensured that they receive the support and resources they need. After identifying the victims, the system has to ensure that their rights are met and needs are provided. They have to give them the opportunity to return to a life of their choice. 
BAD IMMIGRATION POLICIES 
Jean Bruggeman Executive Director, Human Trafficking Legal Center said that human trafficking takes place due to bad immigration policies and that the US is experiencing human trafficking. Unless the sex trade is criminalized in the US, trafficking cannot be stopped. From our studies we have noted that underprivileged and discrimination have driven people to be sex workers. Those who have been convicted, with their cases relating to sex exploitation or human trafficking, will see that the efforts taken to bring them back to the main stream would encounter difficulties. If the victims come out with the truth as to on whose instructions they were engaged in this illegal business it would be the quickest way for them to get out of jail. Although the children under 18 years- victims of trafficking, cannot be arrested, they can be prosecuted. We have to respect human rights of trafficking survivors, Bruggeman said.
Human trafficking is involved in recruitment, smuggling, abducting, transporting, harbouring, buying or selling of a person by means of force, fraud, threats or coercion for the purpose of labour or sexual exploitation which includes minors engaged in commercial sexual activities
-Ugarte
 John Freeman, Supervisory Special Agent of the Diplomatic Security, US Department of State said how he coordinates human trafficking and other specialized investigations for the Criminal Investigations Division at the US Department of State Diplomatic Security Division and added that his office works hand in glove with the FBI and Homeland Security to apprehend those who are engaged in visa and passport frauds. We get lots of calls and e-mail daily and we investigate as to how the labour and sex traffickers have obtained visa for the victims in case they have been trafficked from a foreign country. If the victims provide us with what we are looking for, they can be freed, Freeman said. 
When asked whether he or his office have ever received orders from the high-ranking officials to drop investigations against the traffickers, as it is said that the trafficking are taking place with the involvement of powerful individuals, Freeman told this newspaper that there is no trend as such in the US. No one comes to lay terms and conditions to us. We have been given a free hand to conduct investigations based on the information we receive. Labour and sex trafficking are not a menace only to the US, but to the entire world,Freeman affirmed. 
Polaris is a non-governmental organization and a leader in the global fight to eradicate modern slavery systematically and disrupts the human trafficking networks that rob human beings of their lives and their freedom. 

HOTLINE
Director Polaris, Brandon Bouchard explained how they began operating the National Human Trafficking Resources Center hotline that helps not only those who are trapped in trafficking in the US, but other countries as well. Although the location of their organization is not revealed even to the visiting foreign media, all the media personnel were taken to their office and showed how their hot line is operated, calls are eternally received through the hotline numbers from trafficking victims right round the clock. 
We started in 2002 with two employees and by now we have a staff of 50 to 60 who are working round the clock on the hotline. We get more than 4, 000 calls per week. There are more than 9,000 massage parlours across USA where sex exploitation is taking place. These places have to be scrutinized carefully to arrest the traffickers and to rescue victims. We have trained hotel and airline staffers how to identify the traffickers and victims from their movements. Over the past 10 years we have come across more than 35, 000 human trafficking cases. We are able to obtain details about the traffickers either from the victims or from the general public, Bouchard added. 
Meanwhile, Executive Director Bilateral Safety Corridor Coalition, Marisa Ugarte told Daily Mirror how she has worked for more than 20 years in support of exploited men, women and children by assisting the risk through public awareness programmes that encourage national and international authorities to eradicate human trafficking. 
Human trafficking is involved in recruitment, smuggling, abducting, transporting, harbouring, buying or selling of a person by means of force, fraud, threats or coercion for the purpose of labour or sexual exploitation which includes minors engaged in commercial sexual activities. We have round the clock emergency response teams for crisis intervention, trafficking assessment, identification and assistance in the US and Mexico. We advocate the rights of victims, provide emergency shelter and stable housing, Ugarte said.

THE MEXICAN BORDER
According to her, organ trafficking too has become an issue in the US and how children are trafficked through the Mexican border to San Diego, California. The Mexican border is the issue as the Mexican-US border is around 3218km in length. Millions of vehicles pass through this border every day and the US Government is yet to find a way to check these vehicles whether each and every passenger has a valid visa to enter US and to find out who the traffickers among them are, she added. 
She further said how sex trafficking is taking place in Chinese and Japanese illicit massage parlours that have mushroomed in San Diego. The children are trafficked through sewerage passages. These children are forced to provide labour in agriculture and fishing industries. If we stop buying products from these places as child labour is involved with their production, we can put a stop to labour trafficking. Actions are being taken not only against the traffickers, but also against those who come to obtain the service from the vulnerable victims. As San Diego is a military town, the number one buyer in the sex trafficking business is Military personnel, Ugarte said. 
The Childrens Assessment Center (CAC) in Houston Texas is one of the main places that provides a professional, compassionate and coordinated approach to the treatment of sexually abused children and to serve as an advocate for all children in the US. Up to now the CAC has provided services for over 50, 000 sexually abused children and services designed to meet the physical and emotional needs of sexually abused children and their siblings. Family advocacy services are also routinely available to support non offending caregivers as part of the multi- disciplinary team response. The statistics are staggering. According to the CAC, one in every five children are sexually forced while browsing the internet. The average age for reported abuse is nine years and over 30% of the victims never disclose their experience to anyone. Thirty percent to 40% of the victims are abused by their own family members and the worst is that the victims of child sexual abuse report more symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder, more sadness and more school problems than non victims.

Foreign sex workers in Sri Lanka 

A higher official from Sri Lanka Police talking on conditions of anonymity told the how child soldiers had been recruited by the rebels during the three decade war and added that neither the Government of Sri Lanka nor the Police could take any action against the LTTE regarding forced labour. Child soldiering is also a crime as they are unlawful recruitment. Very young girls and boys had been recruited forcibly by the LTTE and in some cases the children themselves had joined the paramilitary organization to safeguard their families. There were many reported cases where these children had been sent to the battle field as human shields. But we do not know whether these children were sexually abused by the rebels. However after the war concluded we were able to rehabilitate the devastated child soldiers who were undergoing physical and psychological consequences over the years, the sources said.
Up to now we have deported most of them and we have also taken action against those who were managing these massage parlours
He further stated as to how traffickers are using underage children in begging, mostly in and around Colombo. We are handling a number of such cases and according to the victims, they are forced to beg on the streets to make money for the traffickers. These children are not allowed to leave, as rings of people are monitoring them. Though these children are provided with the basic meals, they are not paid for the jobs they do on behalf of the traffickers. They work as slaves and are not allow to leave their jobs. They are being held forcibly, sources claimed.
The sources further said how the Criminal Investigation Department of Sri Lanka Police opened an anti-trafficking unit in 2016 and legal action had been taken against an Uzbekistani lady who had trafficked two young girls from her country promising employment in Sri Lanka. She was married to a Sri Lankan and they have been engaged in trafficking over the past several years. The two victims had been forcibly exploited in the sex industry although they were promised jobs in restaurants. The CID has been notified about this brothel and once raided the husband and the wife were each given a nine-year jail terms, the sources said. According to the sources, the National Child Protection Authority, the Sri Lanka Foreign Employment Bureau and the Department of Immigration and Emigration are working hand in glove to crackdown any trafficking cases. There are only a few cases that have been reported to us. We have forwarded these cases to the CID for further investigations and to take action against the criminals. The police have raided many massage parlours in the country, especially in and around Colombo. At these massage parlours Chinese and Russians were engaged in offering sex to customers. These foreign sex workers cannot be identify as victims as they have come to Sri Lanka to engage in sex trade and were working on tourist visas. Up to now we have deported most of them and we have also taken action against those who were managing these massage parlours. Even the owners of these buildings had been questioned and action had been taken against them as well, the police sources added.
