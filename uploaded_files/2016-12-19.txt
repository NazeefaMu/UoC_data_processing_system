China to return seized U.S. drone

China will return an underwater U.S. drone seized by a naval vessel this week in the South China Sea, both countries said on Saturday, but Beijing complained that Washington had been ?hyping up? the incident. ??
?U.S. President-elect Donald Trump, who has vowed to take an aggressive approach in dealing with China over its economic and military policies, jumped on the unusual drone seizure with a pair of provocative tweets, accusing Beijing of stealing the equipment. ??
The drone, which the Pentagon said was operating lawfully was collecting data about the salinity, temperature and clarity of the water about 50 nautical miles northwest of Subic Bay, off the Philippines. ?
It was seized just as the USNS Bowditch was about to retrieve it, U.S. officials said. ?
??Through direct engagement with Chinese authorities, we have secured an understanding that the Chinese would return the UUV to the United States,? Pentagon spokesman Peter Cook said in a statement. ??

Cuba offers rum to pay debt  to Czech Republic
	
AFP - Cash-strapped Cuba has offered to pay its old debt to the Czech Republic with goods it can spare, including its coveted rum, the Czech finance ministry said Friday.
?The Cuban party as a possible solution presented a list of commodities... (including) several brands of rum,? the ministry said in a statement sent to AFP.
Czech media put the Cuban debt at about seven billion koruna (260 million euros, US$270 million), but the ministry said it had yet to tally the total sum as talks on the repayment had only started late last year.
The debt is largely the legacy of business ties between Cuba and Czechoslovakia, which split into the Czech Republic and Slovakia in 1993, four years after shedding four decades of totalitarian Communist rule.
The largest Czech broadsheet daily Dnes quoted deputy finance minister Lenka Dupakova as saying debt repayment in Cuban rum was ?an interesting option.?
?These are relatively unknown brands which might be good, but we would have to advertise them and generally launch them into the market,? she added.
The daily said the Czech Republic -- a country with the highest per capita beer consumption in the world -- had imported 892 tonnes of Cuban rum worth 53 million koruna (two million euros, dollars) in 2015.
If the entire debt were repaid in rum, the Czechs would have enough rum for 130 years at this pace.
But the ministry is against such a solution.?
?The Czech side believes that at least part of the debt should be dealt in cash,??
it said.

HNB takes top honours at National Productivity Awards for second
	
The award was accepted by Nirosh Perera AGM Network Management and the Process Improvement & Change Management Team of HNB
?
?
Hatton National Bank (HNB) once again won recognition at the National Productivity Awards 2015 winning third place in the ?Service Sector ? Large? category for the second consecutive year. 1st and 2nd place were not awarded.?
The gala event took place in the presence of a distinguished gathering of industry leaders and public servants, with Sri Lankan President Maithripala Sirisena serving as chief guest.
Organized by the National Productivity Secretariat (NPS) of the Ministry of Public Administration and Management under the direction of the Ministry of Public Administration, Local government and Democratic Governance, the National Productivity Awards 2015 is the only national awards programme aimed at facilitating improvements to Sri Lanka?s productive work culture in addition to encouraging innovation and creativity.
HNB?s Chief Operating Officer, Dilshan Rodrigo had this to say about the award. ?We are honoured to be recognized for our efforts to set exemplary benchmarks in efficiency, environmental consciousness and enhancing customer engagement. All of this is only possible due to the efforts of our highly committed and engaged staff who have demonstrated receptiveness to change in our journey of?
continuous improvement?.
Winners were selected according to a stringent set of evaluation criteria on par with evaluation standards followed in Japan, China, South Korea and other member states of the Asian Productivity Organization. HNB has made tremendous strides towards improving productivity and driving operational excellence, both through the refinement of existing processes and the implementation of fresh initiatives all aimed at inculcating a productivity focused work-culture across every level of the organizational hierarchy.?
During the year, HNB achieved significant improvements to its productivity levels through the adoption of a new automated work flow system designed to completely streamline processes like credit appraisal for personal financial services by facilitating the electronic transfer of customer loan application documents to the central credit operations from the branch network. Such measures enabled HNB to achieve an unprecedented level of autonomy to the bank?s branch network by freeing branch staff to focus more on customer engagement and relationship management.?
Improving the ability of the HNB?s sales teams to communicate and forge relationships with potential customers from all walks of life, via training & development was also recognized as another factor contributing to the overall productivity of the bank. ?
Other significant initiatives undertaken towards productivity enhancement by HNB were the implementation of paperless office with automated workflow systems, implementation of 1.3MW solar Photo Voltaic system bringing down the dependency on the national grid by 13 percent thus reducing the ? carbon footprint, plus a fully-fledged on-line learning management system.?

## Title: IMF chief found guilty of criminal negligence

IMF chief found guilty of criminal negligence
	
Christine Lagarde, the managing director of the International Monetary Fund, was found guilty on Monday of criminal charges linked to the misuse of public funds during her time as France?s finance minister, a verdict that could force her out of her post.
Ms. Lagarde, who began her second five-year term at the I.M.F. in February, will not face any jail time, the judge said. The scandal has overshadowed her work at the fund, to which she was appointed in 2011, after Dominique Strauss-Kahn resigned as managing director when he was accused of having sexually assaulted a maid in a New York City hotel.
The move is likely to destabilize the I.M.F. as it faces a host of thorny issues, including questions over its participation in a multibillion-dollar bailout for Greece and uncertainty about the United States? role in the organization once Donald J. Trump becomes president in January.
The verdict was a surprise, after the prosecutor in the trial said last week that the case against her was ?very weak? and did not appear to be enough to win a conviction. It is a theme prosecutors have previously repeated.
The trial revived concerns in France about high-level corruption, shining a spotlight on intimate ties between politicians and businesspeople, and on the large sums that are sometimes used to grease the country?s political wheels.
The case against Ms. Lagarde centered on Bernard Tapie, a former entertainer and owner of Adidas who had previously been jailed on corruption charges. Mr. Tapie accused the lender Cr?dit Lyonnais, in which the French state had a stake at the time, of cheating him when it oversaw the sale of his share in the sportswear empire in 1993. Years of costly legal battles ensued.
In 2007, Ms. Lagarde sent the dispute to a three-person private arbitration authority that awarded Mr. Tapie more than 400 million euros, or $420 million at current exchange rates, in damages and interest, to be paid by the state.
Her critics said that decision was politically tainted, and she was charged with negligence for allowing the arbitration and for then declining to appeal the panel?s verdict.
The trial against Ms. Lagarde was just one facet of the scandal ? many people associated with it are under investigation, for accusations as varied as embezzlement and organized fraud.
Legal proceedings are expected to begin next year against St?phane Richard, the chief executive of the French telecommunications giant Orange and the former chief of staff to Ms. Lagarde, who said that she had relied on his judgment to send Mr. Tapie?s case to arbitration.
Mr. Tapie, who has been ordered by a French court in 2015 to repay the full amount with interest after a judge invalidated it, is expected to be called to a separate trial. He is under bankruptcy protection and has not repaid the sum.
Separately, a judge on the arbitration panel that heard Mr. Tapie?s case is accused of fraud and is expected to be tried, as is Mr. Tapie?s lawyer.
Witnesses at Ms. Lagarde?s trial described a system in which influential, wealthy members of the French elite, like Mr. Tapie, had easy access to government officials and parlayed those relationships to the advantage of both parties, sometimes at the expense of taxpayers.
Bruno B?zard, a former director of the French Treasury, described ?curious relationships? at the Finance Ministry when he worked there with Ms. Lagarde, saying that Mr. Tapie was often seen walking around the hallways, presumably to visit officials ? ?which was rather unexpected.?
Mr. B?zard, who led a government body overseeing state holdings, including a bank set up to take over Cr?dit Lyonnais? bad assets, said Ms. Lagarde had ignored repeated warnings from members of his staff not to proceed with arbitration.
?It was the worst of solutions,? he said. ?But we quickly learned that a political decision had been made, despite the colossal risks? that the state would have to pay for any damages and interest awarded to Mr. Tapie.
Mr. B?zard suggested that Ms. Lagarde had further erred by not challenging the amount of the payout.
?I was more shocked by the speed with which we gave up on contesting it than by the speed of the arbitration decision,? he said. ?Given that the amount was so scandalous, even if we had one chance in 1,000 to win, it should have been done.?
Ms. Lagarde testified that she had declined to do so because it could have resulted in a slew of new lawsuits from Mr. Tapie and additional costs to the state.
Mr. Tapie, a former Socialist who served in the administration of President Fran?ois Mitterrand in the 1990s, switched political allegiances and in 2007 backed the presidential campaign of Nicolas Sarkozy ? the president at the time of the arbitration hearing.
Mr. Tapie visited the ?lys?e Palace, the seat of the French presidency, at least 20 times during Mr. Sarkozy?s first two years in office, the French news media reported. The businessman is said to have met with Mr. Sarkozy and Fran?ois Fillon, the prime minister at the time and the front-runner in next year?s presidential election.
In July 2007, Mr. Tapie met with Mr. Richard, Ms. Lagarde?s chief of staff, and Claude Gu?ant, an aide to Mr. Sarkozy.
Mr. Richard, also a longtime friend of Mr. Sarkozy?s, later said that he had paved the way to move the case to arbitration because he left the meeting with the ?strong impression? that it is what Mr. Gu?ant favored.
Mr. Richard refused to testify at Ms. Lagarde?s trial, citing a parallel criminal inquiry into his role in the events. Mr. Gu?ant was questioned in 2014 as part of a separate investigation into the matter. Both men have denied any wrongdoing. (nytimes)

India appoints new army, air force and intelligence chiefs
	
REUTERS, 18th DECEMBER, 2016- The Indian government has appointed new heads of its army and air force among a series of senior military and intelligence appointments, officials said,?
two weeks before its two most senior defence force chiefs are due to retire.
Vice Chief of Army Staff Lieutenant General Bipin Rawat was named as the new chief of the army to succeed General Dalbir Singh Suhaag.
Air Marshal Birender Singh Dhanoa, a fighter pilot, was chosen as the new chief of India?s air force to replace Air Chief Marshal Arup Raha. The appointments were announced on Twitter by a defence ministry spokesman late on Saturday.
The appointment of Rawat, a counter insurgency specialist, raised eyebrows among opposition parties because he was given the job ahead of two more senior candidates.
?Why has seniority not been respected in appointment of Army Chief,? Manish Tewari, a former government minister and leader of the opposition Congress party, said on Twitter.
The appointment was also questioned by Communist Party of India leader D. Raja, but a spokesman for the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) said it was not a matter for political debate.

IT?S SACRILEGE AND IT?S WIDESPREAD
	
?
I just can?t believe; I just can?t believe,? Shelton Perera kept muttering on his return ?from the Gaja Muduna Temple after inviting the chief incumbent there for a pirith ceremony and an almsgiving the following day in memory of his mother. Shelton?s mumbling prompted his wife Joy to invite him endearingly; ?share your problem with me Shelley; it will lighten things up you know....?
Shelton, the owner of the Wallside Restaurant and Bar complained; ?I don?t know what?s happening to our hamuduruwoes these days. They don?t seem interested in Buddhism or following Buddhist religious practices as they should be any more. And I tell you this is the last time I am inviting hamuduruwoes from that temple for an alms giving.?
?Why, what happened, Shelley??
In Hilton style
?Without even an ?ahem? I was given a list of stuff to be prepared for the almsgiving. It amounted to a five-star lunch without the wine and spirits.?
?Really??
?Of course, do you think I am dreaming or something? The alms order must have been drawn up after staring at a buffet spread at a five-star hotel somewhere.?
And the preference was watalappan and ice cream for dessert over curd and honey; and no fruit salad please. When I saw it, I thought it would be easier to order the stuff from the Hilton without breaking our backs in the Wallside kitchen. ?
Joy giggled. ?Don?t be silly, no hamuduruwo is going to ask for star class feeds. They accept what they are given.?
?That was those days, darlo; this is the form now. True, the lunch menu was handed over to me by a podi hamuduruwo ?but I am sure it was at the dictates of the loku hamudurwoes. Huh, our hamuduruwoes are going down wrong streets; they are also into business.?
Religious business
?Business? How?s that?? Joy?s inquiry was natural.
?I?ll give a small example. The other day, one of our customers told me he was charged 100 bucks for some pirith water he got from a temple in his area and also that he had to cough up another 50 for each member of his family for having a pirith noola tied to their wrists. What else can you call it but hamuduru business, eh?? ? ?Dozing on a chair nearby, Tommo a pussycat employed as a vermin controller at Wallside purred sarcastically, ?Meeooww, and I call it just one tip of a religious iceberg.? ??Whoooom, whooom,? responded Ooty an owl, pussy?s pal and working partner. ?I agree; and they are floating everywhere?from here to Timbuktu. Yeah, yeah, our governor?s religious tutors have gone wonky and our governors are wonkier in allowing that to happen.?
?Meeooowwow (wow), that was pretty strongly put,? ?But, that?s fact see,? hooted the bird shifting its perch on a mahogany arm of a plush chair. ?There is no point in denying that the majority of our governors? hamuduruwoes have turned to ways and means of making money.?
The spiritual guidance governors expect from them is running second. Mr Shelton?s pirith water and pirith nool story is an indication of the business spirit that lurks behind asapu doors. Of course it?s not every hamuduruwo who is business minded.?
Agendas aplenty
? Meeoowwyep (yep),? hissed pussy shifting his position on the floor. ?It?s common knowledge our governor?s Buddhist monks run communication joints, tuition classes, print books on a commercial scale, perform needless rituals, practise astrology, palmistry, recommend and conduct so-called spiritual cures that has nothing to do with Buddhism just to earn money. Some do a bit better by practising Ayurveda. But that too comes at a cost to our governors. Nowadays some identify hamuduruism as a business profession.? Pussy?s declaration was difficult to contest.?
?Hoot, hoot! You have forgotten they also adopt ruses to collect money from governors through temple dayakayas for pinkamas and for all kinds of temple needs. I wonder whether hamuduruwoes have a hand in selling religious artefacts, flowers and at temple premises and the visits of tourists. They are all money spinners the levels of which vary from one temple to another. The bigger and the better known temples and dewala complexes rake in bushels of shekels that are lost in spiritual obscurity. Have you heard of humuduruwoes and dewala nilames keeping accounts? ??
?Purrrrrr! Don?t know. If they do, they certainly don?t end with COPE,? pussy laughed the way pussies do. ?And you know what? Most of our governors who do not quite understand Buddhism get hooked on temple- brewed rituals and affairs veiled as part of Buddhist practices that are money-making avenues. And I tell you it?s not confined to Buddhism either. See what happens at Hindu kovils. Thousands flock to them to pay homage to Hindu gods; ask them for favours and pay vows for favours received. And in doing so, they offer flowers, fruit, make special poojas, make handsome donations give ?presents made of gold to their gods. But how do these offerings ever reach the gods? The dumbos don?t understand that the beneficiaries are poosaris and custodians of kovils. They have made a business out of it. Tens of thousands of Hindu temples across India visited by millions and millions of Hindu governors make damn good money. There are massive Hindu temple complexes earning money in the crores, rich enough to buy half the state in which they are situated. On a smaller scale pretext Hindu Brahmins perform poojas often by force on ?behalf? of Hindu devotees and charge exorbitant fees for their ?services?, I hear. Such parasites don?t even spare tourists. But then a pooja can be conducted by anyone?alone?in a simple manner without a go-between, unnecessary fuss and cost.??
?Ahaaaa!? hooted the wise-looking owl. ?Do you see the common factor? ?Commercialized religion, and it has come of age. But what are governments doing about this sacrilege? The Buddhist set up in this country is vast; a special ministry overlooks it; but has it made a difference? No, but savvy Buddhist governors have moved away from such religious money making hocus-pocus to practise Buddhism the Buddha taught. But that?s just a handful; the rest are just mixed-up cases who have no second thoughts in paying for fiascos generated by religious figures. As one learned priest observed, ?Even a pig?s tail considered holy would be good enough for worship and poojas for such ladies and gentlemen?. Oh yeah, our governors can?t think. See even though Islam forbids practices like bowing at someone?s grave, governors fooled by dishonest Muslim clerics do so. You see the not-so-religious-learnt people are easy meat for religious humbugs chasing after money.? The bird had his moments.?
It?s worldwide?
The discussion between the two was prompted by their master?s and mistress?s short conversation on commercialized religion has crept into most religions to astonishing degrees. Many may argue it is a strategy to keep the membership interested and bound together in religion but then the question is whether such attempts are eroding the core of the traditional religions of the world. ?
?From a heap of western countries to heaps of eastern ones, it has spread like bush fire,? purred pussy. ?I heard that churches in Canada and America are running empty. Some have been put up for sale but others are booming as commercialized religions through mega churches some big enough to accommodate 1500 ?lost souls? looking for spiritual and physical comfort and satisfaction.? (Pussy watched CNN news regularly on his?
master?s TV.)?
?That?s new to me,? hooted the bird??
??Mega churches follow just one policy??total and excellent service?. Their priests do not just preach on Sundays, they keep their churches and church buildings open 24 hours every day of the year. These religious Goliaths are actually complexes that house banks, pharmacies, schools, play grounds, gyms, supermarkets, theatres, food courts, cafes and parking spaces for cars owned by shoppers and church goers. Churches are not religious places anymore; they are financial institutions rolling in money,? purred pussy. ?And pastorpreneurs?deliver the goods just by applying good management techniques. Purshshsh! Old or new it doesn?t matter. Apart from the mod church complexes, it?s an open secret that the Vatican and the Catholic Church, Freemasonry, Judaism, churches like the Church of England, some Hindu temples and Islamic set-ups are extremely rich.?
??Thuhooooot, didn?t I know that,??
hooted the bird.
?Meeoowwyep (Yep).? purred pussy, ?and they dwarf the religious sole-traders in this country...? ?
??It?s all very sad, really,? interrupted Ooty. ?Traditional religious values are fading while religious entrepreneurs keep feasting on governors who keep running from one pillar to another in search of ?spirituality?. Shouldn?t something be done about it?? the bird?
sounded anxious.
?It?s too late for that,? purred pussy. ?The stallions bolted long ago; and the stable keepers who have decided to do better than just bread and butter have jumped the mod religious bandwagon; ?welcome corporate religion, we are with you all the way? is their chorus.??

?Following the referendum we committed to looking at the options that would allow the Lloyd?s market to continue trading seamlessly with the EU,? the group said in a statement sent to AFP on Friday.
?This included establishing a subsidiary model amongst others.
?We will continue to develop our plans on creating a subsidiary and will provide a detailed update to the market on the progress we have made early next year.?
Media reports suggested this week that Lloyd?s has shortlisted five cities that could include Dublin, Frankfurt and Paris, but the group did not comment on this.
Lloyd?s added on Friday that it was in the interests of London?s financial centre ?to have ease of access to the EU?s?
single market.?
Lloyd?s currently enjoys ?passporting? rights -- which allows EU member states to trade across national borders -- while it also benefits from trade agreements.
It also provides a crucial gateway for international insurance companies to access the rest of the European Union.
Britons voted in favour of quitting the EU despite repeated warnings from the business community over the impact of its departure.

This initiative reflects People?s Bank?s dynamic digitalization drive in addition to its impactful sustainability agenda that is leading the national bank to break new ground in offering revolutionary banking solutions. The launch of the new logo mirrors this forward momentum of the bank into the future.
Speaking on the occasion of the logo launch, Minister of Public Enterprise Development, Kabir Hashim ?expressed these sentiments: ?It gives me great pride to witness the symbolic unveiling of People?s Bank new logo, which reflects the Bank?s new aspirations that are mirrored by the citizens of Sri Lanka as well. Now that People?s Bank has set out on the path of digitalization, it will usher in a new era of positive change and value addition by delivering its signature warm and friendly services.

Since then the Bank logo went through many stages of enhancement and the present logo was introduced in the year 2000. Preserving the originality and its promise, the Bank logo will go through a further enhancement as a result of a recent survey conducted, improving only the colour palette and People?s Bank lettering to better convey people?s expectations in the areas identified by the survey; and trust, efficiency and sophistication and to win more clarity and visibility.

An IL-18 aeroplane belonging to the Russian defence ministry has crashed in Yakutia in Siberia with 39 people on board.
The defence ministry said 16 people were seriously injured, correcting earlier reports that 27 had died.
The plane was carrying 32 passengers and seven crew when it came down near Tiksi in the Bulun district of Russia's far east.
Weather conditions were reportedly bad in the area when the crash happened.
The plane was carrying out a scheduled flight from Kansk when it came down about 30km (18 miles) short of Tiksi at 04:45 (19:45 GMT Sunday).
The plane broke into three pieces in what appears to have been an emergency landing.
Three Mi-8 helicopters were despatched to the crash site by Russia's Emergency Ministry.

Scandal-hit Rome mayor keeps job, but party demands reshuffle
	
DPA, 18th DECEMBER, 2016- Rome?s beleaguered mayor, Virginia Raggi, should keep her job, but at the price of dismissing some of her more controversial aides, her anti-establishment Five Star Movement (M5S) decided overnight following a string of scandals.
Over the past week, Raggi?s ? ?garbage commissioner Paola Muraro resigned after being placed under investigation for breaking waste management rules, and her right-hand man Raffaele Marra, head of personnel at city hall, was arrested for corruption. ?Mistakes were made which Virginia has recognized: She trusted the most unsuitable people in the world. We are changing gear from today,? comedian and M5S leader Beppe Grillo wrote on his blog late on Saturday.
In another statement on the blog, Raggi said deputy mayor Daniele Frongia would step down but keep her post as commissioner for sport and youth, while the head of her secretariat, Salvatore Romeo, would quit. Both officials were seen as allies of Marra. The announcement came after 48 hours of crisis talks in Rome between Grillo and local and national M5S representatives, in which the option of kicking out or suspending Raggi from the party was discussed.

SL loses Rs. 9,000 mn to Indian fishermen each year
	
The Sri Lankan fishing industry incurred a loss of Rs. 9,000 million each year due to illegal fishing by Indian fishermen in Sri Lankan waters, the Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Ministry recently said.
Issuing a statement, subject Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said Indian fishermen illegally snared close to 6,000 tons of fish in Sri Lankan waters each week.
?At least three Indian fishing boats enter Sri Lankan waters every week, which is nearly 5,000 fishing boats entering our waters illegally each year. This is a huge threat to the Sri Lankan fishing industry,? the minister said in the statement.
However, he also said the number of Indian fishing boats entering Sri Lanka illegally had decreased by 50 percent, when compared to previous years, due to the high level of security provided by the Sri Lankan Navy and the Sri Lankan Coast Guard.

## Title: SL maid left Singapore as a businesswoman

SL maid left Singapore as a businesswoman
	
A Sri Lankan woman, Nilushika Jayaweera came to Singapore to work as a maid in 2001 and 15 years later, she left as an entrepreneur.
The 36-year-old now buys tea leaves from gardens in Sri Lanka and boxes them for sale to some 500 international customers.
She was back in town recently to join a growing list of inspirational speakers on the TED Talks circuit. Other speakers have included tech giant Bill Gates, former United States vice-president Al Gore and researcher Jane Goodall.
Ms Nilushika was invited to speak at TEDxSingapore on Oct 29 this year at Capital Tower.
Not bad for a woman who grew up in an orphanage and was forced to leave her siblings behind to earn a living.
"Back then, I didn't know who I was or what I wanted. Life just happened to me," said Ms Nilushika, who came to Singapore to support her four younger siblings.
Her parents died when they were young. Ms Nilushika and her siblings grew up in an orphanage.
In her presentation, Ms Nilushika highlighted the work of Aidha, a non-governmental organisation (NGO) in Singapore that mainly teaches maids how to manage their money and start businesses. It was Aidha - a Sanskrit word which means "That to which we aspire" - that transformed her life.
Ms Nilushika said her time in Singapore not only equipped her with business skills, but it also taught her how to empower women in her home country, Sri Lanka.
The money generated from the tea business helped her start her own NGO a few months ago. She is now teaching women in her village how to start small businesses such as pig farming, dressmaking and spice-packing so as to lead independent lives.
Ms Nilushika said she learnt about Aidha in 2011. She was facing some family problems then and her employer thought Aidha's courses could help her. So her employer paid $400 and signed her up for weekend courses where she picked up financial literacy, business and leadership skills.
With these skills, she helped her husband back home to set up a small online tea business.
"Learning the skills from the courses created more choices and possibilities for me. I began to realise that education and empowerment are key to a brighter future for women," Ms Nilushika said in her speech.
She now uses part of her earnings to pay for the children in her village to get an education, including buying them school books.
Ms Nilushika is one of 3,350 domestic workers whom Aidha has reached out to in Singapore since it was set up in 2006. There were 237,100 such workers as of June this year. The NGO, which started as a United Nations Women project, is celebrating its 10th anniversary this year.
According to Aidha's figures, more than four in 10 maids who joined its weekend classes go on to start businesses in their home countries. About a third of those who start a business go into farming, while the rest open restaurants and retail shops.
Aidha also educates domestic workers on the importance of savings. Based on a study of about 1,300 of its students, it found that their monthly savings increased by 68 per cent to about $220 after attending two financial literacy courses. That is almost half of the monthly salary of Indonesian and Filipino maids.
"Having adequate savings and skills to start a business is key, given the dearth of good employment opportunities and low pay back in their home countries.
"We want to break that cycle of poverty and that can start when they are in Singapore," said Aidha's chief executive Jacqueline Loh.
The maids who turn up at Aidha, which is located at United World College in Dover Road, pay $400 to attend three-hour lessons twice a month on Sundays for nine months.
Half of the students have their fees paid for by their employers while others now have a $100 subsidy provided by sponsors.
For instance, MasterCard donated US$15,000 (S$21,700) last week to Aidha's fund-raising campaign. A third of Aidha's costs are covered by student fees, while the rest are drawn from corporate and institutional funders.
The courses, which include language and IT skills, are run by more than 200 trained volunteers. These volunteers, and some maids, also organise hobby-related classes such as on dancing, make-up, yoga and cooking during the weekends.
"We estimate a multiplier effect of nine lives impacted for each of the women who attend our courses based on their average number of dependants and the number of employees in the businesses they start.
"That means over 30,000 lives have been impacted by Aidha's work," said Ms Loh.
Indonesian maid Nur Aini, 34, has been attending courses and helping Aidha with administrative work for the last five years. She is also the leader of a dance group there.
"Aidha is like a second home to me. I gained confidence in using English to communicate with others," said Ms Aini, who plans to return home to start an English school in four years' time.
"I also discovered that I have hopes, dreams and abilities that go beyond domestic work."
Ms Loh said Ms Nilushika's story will inspire others. "Like many of the maids here, she worked for many years and had little savings.
"Her story shows that if she can overcome monumental challenges, others too can do so."(Straitstimes.)

Tamil people suspect Natarajan had role in Jayalalithaa?s death
	
A day after moving the Supreme Court seeking a CBI inquiry into the death of former Tamil Nadu chief minister Jayalalithaa Jayaram, expelled AIADMK MP Sasikala Pushpa today claimed that Sasikala Natarajan and her family might have had something to do with her passing away, the Indian Express reported.
?Tamil Nadu people suspect Sasikala Natarajan and her family might have done something in Amma?s death; need justice,? MP Pushpa told news agency ANI.
Speaking about her writ petition seeking a CBI probe, MP Pushpa said the investigative agency must closely look into matter right from the day former chief minister Jayalalithaa was admitted in Apollo Hospitals till the day she was declared dead.
?Right from the day she was admitted till she was declared dead, CBI must conduct judicial enquiry,? she said.
In her plea before the apex court, the Rajya Sabh MP alleged that former chief minister Jayalalithaa?s death must be treated ?suspicious? as no one was allowed to visit her in hospital and no pictures have been made public.
A similar petition was filed before the Supreme Court last week, raising questions over the circumstances leading to her death.

The last bastion of Human Rights
	
?
Human Rights Defenders(HRDs) are prosecuted worldwide for their activism. According to FORUM-ASIA 24 HRDs have lost their lives in the past year alone, while more than 362 cases of violation and abuses have been recorded.?
The 7th Asian Regional Human Rights Defenders Forum (AHRDF7) was held in Colombo recently. The forum, which meets once in two years focuses on reviewing human rights violations and coming up with more effective mechanisms to protect HRDs.?
The theme of the conference was ?Towards Effective Protection for Human Rights Defenders/Women Human Rights Defenders: Self Reflection and Moving Forward.?
Human rights activists in Sri Lanka point out that enabling the forum to be held in Sri Lanka this year was a positive sign in the progression of promoting and protecting human rights and HRDs.?
However, they also voiced concern about certain violations and issues HRDs have started facing in the present regime.
Challenges faced by HRDs
In a statement they said though threats and interrogations have reduced since 2015, government forces have occasionally discredited NGOs and obstructed the media from covering certain court proceedings and events.
It further notes that protests have been obstructed and protesters have been arrested. The statement raised further concern about HRDs who have been questioned on the field or at the airport. ?The statement highlights that there is slow progress ?in ending impunity by investigating and bringing perpetrators to justice for acts of killing, disappearances and attacks on HRDs.?
Abductions
Arulvathana Sunthararaj, Programme officer ( legal aid) , centre of Human Rights and Development (CHRD) spoke on how the past abductions of persons, during and post the war, is still an unresolved issue as at today.
??As a Human Rights Defender ( HRD) you need confidence in this field and I am happy that this forum has given us this confidence,? she said.
?I have been a Human Rights Officer for the past seven years and I have helped people with cases regarding land rights and missing persons. I was a school teacher, but since my husband?s disappearance in 2009 I became involved in HR activities.?
?Though my husband was abducted I prefer the term arrest, because the people who took him away were in uniform. No one should ever face such horrors in the future. Happy families have been broken, particularly in the North because of abductions. However courageous we are as women, when such atrocities occur it breaks us.?
She also spoke about her activities as a HRs activist? I have helped many women whose husbands have been abducted. But, sometimes I feel helpless because I am not able to give them what they really want. Counseling is given to such victims, but reparations must be made. The victims have been educated about the OMP (Office of Missing Persons), but there is only so much that the OMP can deliver.?
?Many questions still buzz around our heads: When will truth and justice be delivered? Who will find the truth? The Police? Can we trust the Police? Many of us have lost faith in the Police. I have been making demands to the government through my organization, asking them to reveal the truth of about these abductions. But the government does not show much interest towards our dilemma.?
?
Laws delay
She also said that many cases regarding missing persons are delayed. She said, ? In most instances judges transfer the case. We want the government to look into this issue with interest. We sometimes wonder if the cases are dragged on by purpose. We still don?t know if the people who are missing have died or if they are detained. No one understands how we suffer sitting in the dark.?
?
Acquisition of lands
Chinthaka Pradeep, the Moderator of National Land and Agricultural Reforms said that the conference looked at systematic approaches in dealing with challenges faced by HRDs.?
?For a period of 10 years prior to 2015 there was no conducive environment in the country for HRDs to function. At the conference we spoke lengthily about how we can establish this liberty we?ve achieved.? He also expressed doubt as to whether the condition in the country was transforming back to the time of suppression.?
?There is a threat brewing against small scale producers such as farmers, estate workers, people in the North. Our challenge is to work with these people who have been threatened.? ?In this respect, he said, that it was necessary to challenge programmes by the government.?
?The issue of our safety resurfaces here.?
?The budget proposals and other economic development plans by the government show their inclination to acquire large scales of lands used by small scale producers for their livelihood and hand them to their trading companies. This has brought about a threat of dispossession of lands,? he added expressing the need to organize and empower people to stand against such challenges and protect their rights.?
Are HRDs safe ?
Arulvathana Sunthararaj said that a more conducive environment has to be created for HRDs to feel safe.
?I was initially extremely scared to get into this field, because when I was beginning to get involved in 2009, it was a volatile time for HR activists. But, now it is much safer to get involved, but still HR activists have to keep a rather low profile.?
?We are working with the love for humanity, and for us to do our best we need to work in harmony with the government. Female HR activists are still being harassed in the North, but in Colombo we are much safer.?
?However, many of the HR?s problems are outside Colombo and we must take care of people who are at the grass root level. We are all citizens of this country and thus government officers are all responsible for us. My last request is that we must stand strong for the victims whose HRs have been infringed.??

Venezuela postpones currency move after chaos, protests
	
REUTERS, 18th DECEMBER, 2016-Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro suspended on Saturday the elimination of the country?s largest denomination bill, which had sparked cash shortages and nationwide unrest, saying the measure would be postponed until early January.
The surprise pulling of the 100 bolivar note from circulation this week - before new larger bills were available - led to vast lines at banks, looting at scores of shops, anti-government protests and at least one death.
Maduro, speaking from the presidential palace, blamed a ?sabotage? campaign by enemies abroad for the delayed arrival of three planes carrying the new 500, 2,000 and 20,000 bolivar notes.
?One plane, contracted and paid for by Venezuela, was told in flight to change direction and go to another country,? he said, without specifying who had given the orders. ?There?s another which was not given flyover permission.?

Wrong men to Head Police and Navy; Appointments  made Five decades ago?
	
?
In 1959, Prime Minister SWRD Bandaranaike appointed hand-picked, Aleric Abeykoon and in 1955 Sir John Kotalawala appointed Royce de Mel, as IGP and Navy Commander respectively, to head the two institutions and Sirimavo paid the penalty in the early 1960s. Royce de Mel abused his authority by smuggling in contraband in naval vessels and was interdicted. The disgruntled man, Rear Admiral De Mel conspired with a few military men to topple Sirimavo?s Government in 1962. The clueless IGP continued playing bridge at his famous club even after being warned of the coup that was to be staged in a few hours. ? ? ?
?
?
It would be interesting to look at two contrasting views expressed by two former highly respected senior DIGs on the Prime Minister SWRD?s decision to bring in a stranger, M. W. F. Abeykoon from the Ceylon Civil Service to head the Police Department, overlooking several seniors in the service. Senior DIG (Retd) Gamini Gunawardene speaking to the Sunday Times states- ?
?Prime Minister SWRD picked as his new IGP a civil servant who was a Buddhist; M W F Abeykoon... Senior officers met in conference to decide what to do. They considered the first option: the entire Executive Corps should resign en masse? next day they surveyed the executive corps for the senior most officer among them who was a Buddhist?they could find only young SP Stanley Senanayake. They resolved to make representations to the Prime Minister that they were prepared to work under Stanley who was junior to all of them rather than having to work under an outsider with no experience who knew nothing of Police or Police Ordinance.?? Sunday Times, Plus; 28/11/2010 ?
In contrast, Senior DIG (Retd), Edward Gunawardene, writing to the same newspaper, the Sunday Times of April 30, 2006, says, ?
?The IGP Osmund de Silva had retired and a serious crisis had developed with brothers C. C. Dissanayake and S. A. Dissanayake; and Sydney de Zoysa, all DIGs with equal seniority hotly contending for the plum. SWRD Bandaranaike, the shrewd Prime Minister seized this opportunity gifted by the internecine conflict? to appoint a man of his choice.? ?Sunday Times, Plus; 30/04/06 ?
Some political analysts have attempted to point a finger at Prime Minister Bandaranaike on this issue criticizing his action as the beginning of the politicization of the Police service. Unfortunately, the precedence was created by the rulers in 1947, when they brought in outsider Sir Richard Aluvihare, a member of Ceylon Civil Service, who at the time was serving in the Treasury as a Senior Administrator, to the position of Inspector General of Police, who ran the department efficiently unlike Bandaranike?s choice. ?
As an outsider, a man who had never worn a uniform, M. W. F. Abeykoon was parachuted and made the 14th IGP of Ceylon. He served from April 26, 1959 to April 29, 1963, under both Bandaranaikes. The PMs knew they had blundered badly and Abeykoon would only be a puppet and the Police would be akin to a ship minus a rudder. ??
Two of his DIGs [out of six] conspired to stage a Coup d??tat during his tenure. In so far as we are aware, the system that was introduced and prevailed till the late S. W. R. D. Bandaranaike took over as the Prime Minister of Ceylon(now Sri Lanka), was to have the next most Senior Officer appointed as the Inspector General of Police, when a vacancy occurred. ?
?Mr. Abeykoon was playing bridge at The Orient Club, while his subordinates were planning a Coup d??tat! ?

Royce de Mel as Navy Commander ?
There were six of them, the famous de Mel brothers, who turned a new leaf in the history of St Joseph?s College. Out of the six, Royce was the eldest, who excelled in athletics. He joined the Royal Navy, and progressed to reach the top as the first Lankan Commander of the Navy. He was appointed on 15 August 1955. De Mel was promoted to Rear Admiral in 1959, becoming the first serving officer to hold the rank. The Ceylon Navy was launched on 9th of December 1950, under the Ceylon Navy Act, replacing the British Royal Ceylon Navy with the English commander, W E Banks retained as Captain (chief), until the return of Commander Royce de Mel, who was in the UK, under training. His brother was Maurice, a sportsman himself, who rose to the rank of Colonel and subsequently promoted to Chief of Staff, or the second-in-command of the Army by 1960. The two brothers were charged with conspiring to topple the government in 1962 and was placed sixth and second defendants in the Coup trial, Queen vs Liyanage. ??
?Royce de Mel was very fatalistic about the consequences to him of his involvement in the coup. As a devout Roman Catholic he believed that God wanted to punish him by making him go to jail. He conceded that in many countries coup leaders like him would have been placed against a wall and shot? -JRJ Biography: K M de Silva/Howard Wriggins;-Pp 119 ?
The new government that Bandaranaike established in 1956 decided to take over, as part of its programme in freeing the nation of every little hold of the colonial masters, preferred to have the Navy and Air Force under its arm. The British Government was informed accordingly. On October 15, 1957, the naval base was nationalized at a ceremony attended by SWRD Bandaranaike, the then Prime Minister, marking a significant milestone in the path to gaining complete independence. Sri Lanka Navy thereafter took over the administration using Trincomalee as the key naval base, a progressive step disliked by many officer cadres. ??
Royce de Mel had been ?captain? (as the commander was known then), until 1961, when he was sent on compulsory retirement following a revelation in a report submitted by a committee that investigated irregularities in the Navy. They found him guilty of smuggling contraband on a naval craft. Royce de Mel was the only suspect in the 1962 coup who went underground to evade arrest. However, at the commencement of the trial he surrendered to Trial at Bar through his lawyer, G. G. Ponnambalam QC. ??
Extract from, Blueprint to Bluewater-- The Indian Navy, 1951-65 ?
??We paid a good will visit to Colombo in 1962. We had a few Ceylonese cadets on board and I used the opportunity to hold meetings with Ceylonese Sri Lankan Naval Headquarters and the Defence Ministry to sort out some administrative problems these cadets were experiencing.?
Shortly after we left Colombo a local newspaper published a report saying that the real purpose our visit was to smuggle former Rear Admiral Royce de Mel, ex Chief of Navy, out of the country.
Admiral had been sacked an year earlier for alleged involvement in a local scandal.? By Satyindra Singh: pp- 508 ?
?The above attempt was thwarted by alert security men who knew about de Mel?s close contact with his Indian naval friends. He was under warrants and was evading arrest. ? When CBK?s Security men led an attack on media on July 15, 1999, journalists covering the march organized by the UNP were brutally attacked with batons, tear gas, rubber bullets and high-pressure water cannons. The attackers, PSD men uniformed and in civil clothes snatched cameras from most of the journalists, destroyed some of them on the spot and seized ?those of some others. When the club-wielding policemen and thugs [Beddagane Sanjeewa, a well known criminal was absorbed into the PSD of CBK] were harshly assaulting the journalists, uniformed policemen were abusing the journalists. Sunday Times photographer, Athula Devapriya, was assaulted and arrested. His film was taken out and exposed.?
It was a well-planned and well-targeted attack. 10 journalists were injured seriously out of about 25 injured, most of them had to be hospitalized. ?
Journalists who were assaulted recognized the police officers and constables connected with the PSD. Ravaya newspaper carried photos of the two policemen?SI Thusara Perera, and constable Saliya of the PSD?clearly screening their involvement in the attack. The UNP demonstrators were also beaten and dispersed. They abandoned their plan to march. Several UNP leaders, including former ministers were injured and had to be hospitalized. The UNP marched to protest the failure of the People?s Alliance government of CBK to fulfil its election pledges; especially the promise to abolish the Executive Presidency. Today the UNP is back in power, ironically they too do not fulfil promises, but attack demonstrators. ?
?
Politics and Media freedom ?
Just the day before the attack, the Media Minister, Mangala Samaraweera issued a press release critical of the media who exposed corruption in the PA Government, and prepared the climate for the attack the following day. President Kumaratunga described them as ?Media Mafia?. The statement said, people should endeavour to ?save the free media from the Media Mafia which is taking undue advantage of the free media culture established by the PA Government?.
The next day, the same Minister blamed the demonstrators, the UNP. DIG, T.N. de Silva, who was in charge of the police team deployed at the venue on July 15, told reporters that PSD officers were not involved in the assault and ?neither I nor any other police officers had seen anyone being assaulted?.?
However, Saman Mendis, a photographer attached to government-owned Lake House, contradicted the Media Minister and confirmed saying, ?When I was about to be assaulted, realizing that the attackers are mobilized by the regime, I shouted ?I am from the Lake House?.? But they did not shoot indiscriminately like in Wathupitiwela. ?
A combined force of journalist held a protest march to Temple Trees a week later. A police battalion kept watch about 100 meters away. At that point the journalist demonstrators burned the effigies of Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera and the chief of the PSD, ASP Nihal Karunaratna. ?
?The only security of all?
is in a free press.? ??
