A six year-old elephant calf donated to New Zealand
	
		A female elephant calf named Anjalee  a resident of the Pinnawala elephant orphanage has been given to new Zealands Auckland zoo in honor of an exchange agreement made between the two countries.
	
	The six year-old elephant calf had braved a 12-hour flight from Sri Lanka to Auckland and is currently being kept in quarantine in Niue before being transported to the zoo to keep company to its other elephant, Burma.
	
	Environmental lawyer and activist, Jagath Gunawardena commenting on the donation of the animal said, Section 55 of the Fauna and Flora Ordinance states very clearly that a donation of an animal to another country should be carried out as an exchange between two national zoological gardens. So the important question to ask in this instance is whether the Auckland zoo has been certified as a national zoological garden And on what basis was this animal exchanged What is Sri Lanka getting in return
	
	He also stressed on the fact that since elephants are animals that live in herds, separating her from the environs that she is used to, will result in major psychological impacts on her health that would be detrimental for her wellbeing.
	
	Deputy Wildlife Minister Wasantha Senanayake said although he is personally opposed to the exportation of elephants, they proceeded with the exchange as it was an agreement made between the countries heads of state.
	
	The agreement to exchange this elephant calf in return of technical assistance had been made during the CHOGM period between former President Rajapaksa and the New Zealand Prime Minister, the Minister said.
	
	However, he said that he admits that irrelevant of whether its an elephant sent to the Auckland zoo or kept in captivity in Sri Lanka, the animal undergoes tremendous mental pressure due to being separated from its herd.
	
	I personally believe we should never export elephants. India introduced a law which doesnt allow the exportation of Indian elephants and I think we too should adopt a similar policy. But it should be noted that presently, its legal to export a tame, second generation elephant, he said.
	
	The Minister went on to state that he is currently discussing with some of the groups that are engaged in the exportation of elephants, to create a voice to discourage them from exporting the local elephants. (Lakna Paranamanna)

CB Governor to face legal action in Singapore
	
Voice against Corruption is to file legal action against Central Bank Governor Arjuna Mahendran in Singaporean High Courts on violation of emigration laws of that country, its Convener Wansantha Samarasinghe said.
Mr. Samarainghe told Daily Mirror that legal experts of Voice against Corruption are planning to file action against Mr. Mahendran in Singaporean Courts for violating that countrys emigration laws. We decided on this action as Mr. Mehenadran is a Singaporean Citizen, Mr. Samarasinghe said.
He said Mr. Mahendran had violated the Singaporean emigration laws by accepting the post of Central Bank Governor in Sri Lanka while obtaining permanent residency in Sri Lanka. Mr. Samarainnghe said no Singaporean citizen can obtain permanent residency in another country according to that countrys emigration laws.
Meanwhile, Voice against Corruption had filed fresh charges against former Central Bank Governor Ajith Nivard Cabraal, members of EPF investment board and some stock market agents with the criminal investigation authorities and the Bribery Commission on certain unprofitable investments of EPF funds.
Also he said Voice against Corruption had received information on some fraudulent deals by some Ministers in the present government and will make complaints against them to law enforcement institutions.
Mr. Samarasinghe who responded to the allegations made by few opposition MPs that the Voice against Corruption was engaged in getting the government to harass them and their families , said denying all charges and acting innocent had become a fashion today. He said the charges made by Voice against Corruption are not false at all as these are made by a panel of lawyers and audit experts.

IOC, FIFA issue red notice on Sri Lanka
	
The International Olympic Committee (IOC) and its member FIFA - the world governing body for football, have asked Sri Lanka to reverse its decision to hold elections under controversial provisions of the Sports Law in order to ensure autonomy and jurisdiction of national sports associations. Failure to do so would leave Sri Lanka at risk of international status, they have warned.
This unilateral action goes against the principles and rules of the Olympic Movement and our previous agreements, writes Patrick J. Hickey, IOC Delegate Member for Autonomy, in a letter addressed to Minister of Sports Navin Dissanayake on April 7.
We would like to remind you that all FIFA members are obliged to manage their internal affairs independently, as stipulated in articles 13 and 17 of the FIFA Statues.The unilateral promulgation of new regulations by the ministry goes against this obligation and is putting the FFSL at risk of being sanctioned, which is usually the case in the event of government interference, Jerome Valcke, Secretary General, FIFA writes separately to Ranjith Rodrigo, President Football Federation of Sri Lanka.
The letters come in the wake of a Sports Ministry decision to hold elections under controversial provisions of the Sports Law and the subsequent regulations made on January 15, 2013.
Consequently, it is not acceptable and it is our duty to warn you that the international sports institutions concerned will not be able to recognize the results of elections orchestrated unilaterally by your ministry. In addition, should this happen, the international sports institutions concerned would be compelled to consider appropriate protective measures (including suspension, which unfortunately would considerably damage the representation of your country at international sports events, states the IOC letter, which is jointly signed by President of the Olympic Council of Asia (OCA) and President, Association of Summer Olympic International Federations.
The IOC demands revisions of the Sports Law and regulations in consultation with the National Olympic Committee of Sri Lanka and national federations to ensure full compatibility with the principles which governs the Olympic Movement. It wants this done before May 31 and also calls for the cessation of any pressure on national federations to hold their elections under the current Sports Law as well as regulations to avoid any further action.
However, if the the situation is not rectified immediately, the case will have to be reported to the IOC Executive Board and to each International Federations concerned for further action including suspension, the IOC warns.
A recent opinion by the Attorney Generals department on appointment of members to National Sports Associations sparked a lengthy debate in sporting circles as experts believe the Sports Regulations No.1 of 2013 cannot be implemented retrospectively.

The Attorney Generals department held that the regulations gazetted in January 15, 2013 could be implemented prior and consequence meaning that those who have held office for four or more years in key positions of President, Secretary, Treasurer, Vice-President, Assistant Secretary, Assistant Treasurer cannot seek re-election.
The new amendments restricted the term of office bearers to two years and a further term subject to the approval of the Sports Minister and also laid down various conditions on their qualification to hold such office.
It also bars the Minister of permitting more than two terms for any one as it clearly says, ...provided that, the period during which a person serves in any one of the said positions, shall not in the aggregate exceeds four years. 
As you have certainly been informed, we have repeatedly requested over the last few years that the Sports Law and the regulations in Sri Lanka be reviewed in a constructive manner in order to make them fully compatible with the basic principles of the Olympic Movement, including the principle of autonomy.
We understand that some progress has been made to produce a revised draft; however, the process has not been finalized within the deadlines established initially with your predecessor. With your recent appointment, we were therefore expecting that appropriate action would be taken to complete this process as soon as possible. Surprisingly, we were informed recently that, instead of finalizing this first step, you decided to move forward unilaterally by instructing the national sports federation to hold their elections under the current sports regulations. the IOCs letter to the Minister adds. (Champika Fernando)Minister Navin Dissanayake replies:
Your caption saying that the sports ministry has been given a ' red letter' notice is misleading as the letter sent by the IOC and other sports organization does not indicate any suspension procedures to be initiated. I, as the Sports Minister, am bound to carry out the law of the land (which was in place before I assumed office) and have never interfered in the decision making or administrative aspects of sports bodies as my letter to the international sports bodies clearly explains.

Red box security if SL cricket team visits Pakistan
	
	Pakistan said that if the Sri Lankan cricket team tours Pakistan, they would be accorded memorable welcome and would be given red box security.
Pakistans Inter Provincial Coordination (IPC) minister Mian Riaz Hussain Pirzada Saturday termed Sri Lanka as his second home and described them as Pakistan's very close friends and said he was rooting for Sri Lanka alongside Pakistan in the World Cup.
Riaz expressed these views while talking exclusively with Pakistan based The Nation on Saturday.
He said Sri Lankans always stands by Pakistan through thick and thin and they are very grateful to them.
Despite attack on their cricket team in the unfortunate Lahore incident, they never turn their backs on Pakistan.
We salute their gesture and will never forget their brotherly treatment rendered to Pakistan in all the sporting fields.
Whenever Pakistan wanted Sri Lankan teams weather cricket table tennis, football or any other sports they always responded in positive manner.
Now by the grace of God and with superb efforts by our Army after operation Zarb-e-Azb, things are quite different and security situation is far better.
We would left no stone unturned and initiate best possible measures to ensure no repeat of that bizarre Lahore incident.
 Riaz said Zimbabwe are willing to tour Pakistan, which is not only great positive sign but also shows that international teams trust current government.
I am sure international cricket return to Pakistan would help people to get over that dark days period when nobody was ready to tour Pakistan.
