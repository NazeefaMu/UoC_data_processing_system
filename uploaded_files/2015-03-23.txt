Berendina expands microfinance services to Horowpathana
	
Berendina Micro Investments Ltd opened its first branch in Horowpathana in the Anuradhapura District recently.
Berendina Micro Investments Ltd is established to extend the microfinance services of the Berendina group, which has been so far done under the Berendina Microfinance Institute (BMI) (GTE) Limited, which has been operation in Sri Lanka since 2007 and has been assisting the rural poor and plantation communities with micro credit and enterprise development services through an 18-branch network covering six districts.
The Horowpathana branch will be the Berendina group?s fifth microfinance branch in the Anuradhapura District. Currently, BMI operates branches in the Manupa (Anuradhapura town), Ipalogama, Kahatagasdigiliya and Thirappane areas of the district.
In 2015, as part of a strategic decision, the Berendina group formed a new organisation called Berendina Micro Investments Ltd, which will function in parallel with BMI. All services provided by BMI will be continued with Berendina Micro Investments and an increase in service quality is envisaged with this strategic change.
The chief guest at the Horowpathana branch opening was BerendinaG Director and Berendina Micro Investments Chairman Anura Attapattu while Director/General Manager Charith Fernando and BMI Operations Manager Ishan Rajika, were the guests of honour at the event.?
Assistant Divisional Secretary R. Senthil and Senior Inspector of Police Suneth Warnasuriya, Grama Niladhari S. Thilakaratne were special invitees who spoke on the importance of having an organisation such as Berendina for the Horowpathana area. The representatives of other development organisations and people who will benefit from Berendina also participated in the occasion. ? ?
As of February 28, 2015, Berendina?s microfinance operations consisted of 69,433 borrowers with an outstanding loan portfolio of over Rs.1.5 billion. Berendina provides loans at the lowest interest rate by any private sector or NGO organisation.

Fitch affirms Melsta Regal Finance at ?A+(lka)?; Outlook Stable
	
		 		 
		 
			
Fitch Ratings has affirmed Melsta Regal Finance Ltd?s (MRF) national long-term rating at ?A+(lka)?. The outlook is stable.
MRF?s rating reflects Fitch?s expectation of support from its ultimate parent, Distilleries Company of Sri Lanka (DIST; AAA(lka)/Stable).
MRF is rated four notches lower than DIST due to MRF?s insignificant role in the group. MRF has limited synergies with the group?s core business, a low level of operational integration and a lack of a common brand with the group.
MRF accounted for just 1.3 percent of group revenue and 1.1 percent of consolidated net profit in the nine months to December 2014. Although not planned, the disposal of MRF would not materially alter the group?s operations or earnings.
Working capital finance remains one of MRF?s core products, accounting for about 50 percent of new advances. This includes financing to DIST suppliers and customers. At end-December 2014, trade finance and factoring accounted for 43 percent of MRF?s loan book, followed by leases and hire-purchase loans at 36 percent and loans and advances at 21 percent.
DIST has full effective ownership of MRF through Melstacorp Limited (ML), the investment holding company for DIST?s non-beverage assets. DIST is represented on MRF?s board and has demonstrated support through equity infusions, the last of which occurred at end-March 2014 to finance growth.
DIST?s ability to support the entity is based on its market leadership in alcoholic beverage production in Sri Lanka, a highly profitable sector characterised by relatively stable demand through economic cycles and high entry barriers.
MRF is a licensed finance company that commenced commercial operations in October 2012.
MRF?s rating may be downgraded if there is a decline in DIST?s ability or propensity to provide support. This may stem from a downgrade of DIST?s national long-term rating, or weakening linkages between DIST and MRF.
An upgrade of MRF?s rating would only result from an increase in DIST?s willingness to provide support as DIST?s ratings are already at the top of the national rating scale. Narrower notching could result from MRF?s stronger operational integration or higher importance to the group through stronger linkages, aligned management, shared brand, larger scale, greater synergies or higher profit contribution.

Video: I will be Opposition Leader: Nimal
	
	Parliamentarian Nimal Siripala de Silva today said he would continue to remain the Opposition Leader despite the unique situation emerged in Parliament following the formation of the National Unity Government and added that the government?s 100-day programme may be extend into even 200-days depending on the pace with which, the promised amendments to the Constitution and the electoral reforms would be implemented.
	Speaking to the media during a press briefing at the SLFP headquarters in Colombo yesterday, Opposition Sri Lanka Freedom Party Leader Nimal Siripalade Silva said he would continue to remain in the position since he did not believe the SLFP?s stature as the main opposition party had been compromised, although a group of MPs accepted ministerial positions of the National Unity Government.
	?The President has given us the complete freedom to criticise any of the government policies and even our own SLFP MPs who have assumed duties as Ministers, if the necessity arises. Therefore, the SLFP continues to be the main opposition party and I will remain the Opposition Leader unless the party calls for a change,? he said.
	He compared the present situation in Parliament to when Minister Karu Jayasuriya, who was then in the Opposition, along with a group of 17 UNP MPs extended their support to the UPFA government and assumed duties as Ministers.
	?Did anyone question the position of the UNP as the main opposition party at that point? The present situation is very much the same- hence, there is no change in the SLFP position as the main Opposition,? he said.
	The Opposition Leader said the decision to form a National Unity Government was made in order to facilitate the effective implementation of the 100-day programme including the Constitutional amendments. He added that few more SLFP MPs would be sworn-in within the next few days.
	?These MPs have already decided not to accept the Ministerial salary and will be operating under minimal facilities. Our aim is to facilitate the smooth implementation of the 100-day program and to ensure the SLFP has a stronger voice within the cabinet in pushing for the necessary constitutional amendments and electoral reforms,? he added. ?
	He said that they too were demanding for the swift implementation of the electoral reforms and stressed on the need for the upcoming general elections to be held under the new system.
	Speaking of the 19th Amendment to the Constitution, he said the draft of the Constitutional Amendment that was Gazetted did not clearly reflect certain changes that were highlighted by the party leaders during the meeting held to discuss 19A.
	?Section eight of the Amendment declares the PM as the Leader of the Cabinet. We have already expressed our objection and we want it amended and the President be made the leader of the Cabinet.
	?Other than that, we are in agreement with the other sections that have curtailed some of the powers of the Executive president,? he said.
	?There are also various contradictions in the content, but it?s only natural. Overall it?s a commendable draft and we have agreed to it principally but minor changes such as the drafting patterns needs fine-tuning,? he said. (Lakna Paranamanna)

	Q: What do you think about a group of SLFP MPs accepting ministerial portfolios?
	A: You should ask that question from them.
	Q: You haven?t received the official residence yet?
	A: It would be given.
	Q: The MPs who were to support you, have taken ministerial portfolios. How do you feel?
	A: All are supporting me. No one is against me. Who are against me? Just name anyone, then I can inquire from him. As far as I am concerned no one is against me. How can those who were with me for several years go against me?
	Q: A person, who was with you for a long period left you?
	A: Who?
	Q: The current President.
	A: Yes, but he became the President. If it is good for him, I am very happy.

Seylan wins Effie for ?Seylan Sure? communication campaign
	
Seylan Bank won a Bronze award for its communication campaign on its premier savings product Seylan Sure, at the recently concluded Effie Awards, organised by the Sri Lanka Institute of Marketing.?
Winning the only award in this category (where no Golds or Silvers were awarded) for the effectiveness of its communication campaign, Seylan once again demonstrated its ability to break new grounds in testing the pulse of its target market and being in sync with its hopes and aspirations in saving with ?the bank with a heart?.
In a 360 degree communication campaign which addressed and appealed to the average saver/income earner, the bank used an idiom which had a true spirit of the Sri Lankan culture which when translated means, ?Don?t wait for something that will never happen? to express a stark truism which it related directly to its campaign, bringing it the sweeping success it desired to grow its savings base.
Interestingly, the Seylan Sure brand had won a number of awards during 2014 from many forums including, Marketing Campaign of the year and best Loyalty programme at the Global Marketing Excellence awards, Excellence in Integrated Marketing Communication at the third Asian Customer Engagement Forum Awards and also a merit award for the best television commercial at Sumathi Tele Awards 2014.
The idea was brought to life using the popularly known Sri Lankan idioms that showcased the futility of waiting for something that cannot happen, such as ?kalu kaputa sudu vena thuru? (waiting until the black crow turns white) or ?molgahe dalu enathuru? (waiting for the pestle to bear leaves) and ?kukula biththara damana thuru? (waiting until a rooster lays eggs).
?We are delighted with this win and wish to thank Triad advertising, our creative agency partner, for working tirelessly with the marketing and liability products management team and the branch staff at the bank for bringing this campaign to life and ensuring a 360 degree campaign and leading us to tremendous market success which exceeded our targets, ?Seylan Bank?s DGM responsible for Liability Product Management, Personal Banking, Digital Alternative Channels, Marketing and Housing Loans Product Management, Tilan Wijeyesekera said.?
The bank used an integrated marketing campaign with an advertising campaign on electronic and print media, backed by a town/office/factory storming campaigns communicating the futility of lottery style promotions and the ?sure? benefits of Seylan Sure.
The ?sure benefits? of Seylan Sure were also communicated to potential customers through a joint SMS campaign with mobile service providers. The bank also used social media to communicate to potential customers through engaging campaigns on Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and Google placement ads.?
In a truly insightful savings reward scheme, the bank drew its entire customer base into its fold, assuring them special sure rewards and gifts in celebration of its special milestones in life. ?The rewards scheme offered all customers ?sure? gifts at marriage, at the birth of every child, for surgery and on the 60th birthday, in recognition of senior citizenship.
Seylan Sure is the only scheme with sure gifts for personal savings account holders and personal current account holders, to receive these non-repayable cash grants and gifts for milestones in life. All savings and current account holders with a minimum balance of Rs.20,000 for a continuous period of six and 12 months are eligible for these gifts.?
A further challenge was to bring out the gifts offered by the account, as most potential customers did not know about the benefits. The objectives were to mobilize the saving deposits during the period, enhance the corporate image of the bank, create opportunity for cross selling and up-selling at branches, increase new customers to the bank and conversions from other banks, prevent erosion of savings base to competition and achieve low-cost deposits targets for 2014.?

SLFP given portfolios to cover up CB scandal: Dinesh
	
The appointment of Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) MPs as Ministers was an attempt to cover up the wrongdoings of the government led by the United National Party (UNP), especially the Central Bank Bond Sale issue, Parliamentarian Dinesh Gunawardane charged today.
United People?s Freedom Alliance (UPFA) MP Gunawardane said the bond sale issue was one of the largest corrupt deals that had taken place in the country and also in the history of the Central Bank.
?SLFP MPs who went to the Bribery Commission against the Central Bank Governor for allowing the corrupt deal have been appointed as ministers in the government today. This is absurd,? he told a news conference in Colombo.
He said the CB Governor should be removed immediately as he was not a Sri Lankan citizen and said the deal was a black mark to the Central Bank.
?Functioning of the Central Bank, while the governor is on leave, is not beneficial to the banking system.? The Prime Minister had taken over the Central Bank which was under the purview of the Finance Minister earlier. Therefore, the Prime Minister should take responsibility,? he said.
MP Gunawardane said under these circumstances they didn?t approve the appointments of SLFP MPS as Ministers in the Government and said the move was against the franchise given to the UPFA.
UPFA MP Wimal Weerawansa said that 6.2 million of people those contributed in President Maithripala Sirisena?s victory had been left stunned with the new appointments.
?This is not a promise given under the 100-day programme. Neither the 6.2 million who voted for Maithripala Sirisena nor the 5.8 million voted against him asked for these appointments.? Even before the conclusion of the 100 days, the government had doubled the number of ministers,? he said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)Pix by Nisal Baduge

Task Force under CBK to solve minority issues
	
	President Maitripala Sirisena today said a Special Presidential Task Force (SPTF) had been appointed under the Chair of former President Chandrika Kumaratunga to address the issues of minorities.
	The SPTF would go into the matter step by step and would come up with most suitable and pragmatic solutions that would fulfill the aspirations of all communities, the President said.
	Addressing a ceremony held at the Valalai at Vakarai East in the Eastern part of the Palaly High Security Zone to distribute lands that had been under the armed forces to their owners, President Sirisena went onto say that the land issue in the North was not a fresh problem but it was further aggravated as it was a fall out of the 30 year separatist war.
	A sustainable solution to the all burning problems of the Northern people would be found within his first term of office and the land issue would get the priority of them, the President said.
	?If we go through the world history, the land issues have contributed to many a war, rebellion and clash all over the world since the time immemorial. It was a struggle between the land owners and those who do not posses lands.
	?Karl Marx has explained very clearly that the root cause to the fight between the land lords and the proletariat was on the ownership of lands. Therefore, we politicians must pay our attention to resolve land issues all the time,? President Sirisena emphasised.
	?The war had a devastating effect not only on the North?East but in all other parts of the country including Colombo. As a newly elected government with the blessings and support of all communities, the government was in the process of finding solutions to all pressing problems of the minority communities. It is no doubt that there may be setbacks to this endeavour, but most important was that the government has started to rectify the errors if there were any,? he said.
	President Sirisena said he was well aware of the problems faced by people in the North-East as those problems are discussed in Parliament, with armed forces personnel and in Colombo and here in the North.
	Therefore, the government had a clear understanding on the issues of the North and East and added that people of all communities and in all parts of the country voted for him at the Presidential election as they had great confidence in him.
	?Therefore, I believe that I have been given a mandate to solve your problems and I will give a permanent solution to all your problems before the end of my first term as the Executive President,? President Sirisena stressed.
	President Sirisena said he would visit the people at their own homes in future to obtain a firsthand account of their problems and not to address them on big stages like today. The first step to promote reconciliation was to build the sense of brotherhood, mutual understanding and mutual respect among each community.
	He said that the government would take steps to reconstruct all places of religious importance belonging to all faiths like Buddhist temples, Hindu Kovils, Mosques and Churches destroyed to the war.
	The government was also determined to reconstruct all state buildings such as hospitals, schools and other public establishments as early as possible, he said. ?
	President Sirisena said he felt extremely sorry for the people living in this part of the country when he saw their struggle for life. Their life was much different from those living in Matara, Kandy or Nuwara-Eliya.
	?Our heart burns when the children in this part of the country cry in the similar way we feel when we hear a child in the south cries. The biggest problem faced by the people in the North was the availability of drinking water and the government would shortly launch a project aiming at providing safe drinking water to the people in the North,? he said.
	?Our objective is to provide a better future and comfortable life to the next generation. Your children must not confront the difficulties you faced. Your children must lead a better and more contended life than you. That is why we are keen to give quick solutions to your most pressing problems like the land issue and drinking a water problem. If the government could resolve those issues as quickly as possible, half of your problems may have addressed,? President Sirisena added.
	Resettlement and Hindu Religious Affairs Minister D.M. Swaminathan and Women?s Affairs Deputy Minister Wijayakala Maheswaran also spoke.
	Documents to 31 plots of lands in Valalai to re-vest the ownership to their rightful owners were distributed by President Sirisena, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, Former President Chandrika Kumaratunga and Minister Swaminathan and Deputy Minister Maheswaran.

Wele Suda disputes case against him
	
	Wela Suda, his wife and another accused contended before High Court Judge Devika Tennakoon De Livera today that the prosecution cannot maintain the money laundering case against them as the indictment was erroneous.
	Senior Counsel Anura Meddegoda defending Wele Suda?s wife submitted that the 57 indictments filed in the charge sheet were erroneous because the Penal Code by Section 174 and 175 had specifically stated that the charges should be framed on the offences that have committed within a period of one year.
	He asserted that according to that Section only three such offences committed by an accused within a period of one year should be filed in one indictment.
	However, the Attorney General had filed 57 charges allegedly committed by the accused, Samantha Kumara Vithanange alias Wele Suda, his wife and another accused within a period of two years and four months commencing from January1, 2010 to April 24, 2012- which was wrong, the counsel said
