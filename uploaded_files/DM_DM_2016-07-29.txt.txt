ATL secures two wins at inaugural Sri Lanka Insurance Industry Awards 2016
	

Endorsing its presence and commitment to quality in all areas of operations, Amna Takaful (ATL) PLC won two highly acclaimed awards in multiple subject areas, at the inaugural Sri Lanka Insurance Industry Awards 2016.
The first award category in which ATL clinched an award for the night was the Marketing Initiative/Campaign Award. The campaign nominated for this award was Open to All. Launched in January 2015, this campaign was aired through all mediums of communication.
The Strategy of the Open to All campaign was to change the publics perception. The insight for the campaign came from a market study commissioned by the company amongst its target audiences. The findings revealed that Amana Takaful PLC is perceived by a majority of the public as an organisation, catering exclusively to a specific community. As such, the company needed to redefine its presence and identity and reposition itself amongst the insuring public as a whole.
Records further showed that at the time, the percentage of revenue contributed by the Muslim community was only 60 percent and the rest contributed a substantial 40 percent that was identified as a potential opportunity for further penetration into this segment. The campaign constituted of two phases. During the first phase, the single-minded message of Open to All was established amongst the public, thus laying the foundation for a smooth transition to the second phase, which is themed Come Step In/Come Discover/Come Quench and is currently ongoing.
Commenting on its triumph ATL CEO Fazal Ghaffoor said, Our objective was primarily to change perception and communicate the clear message that our products and services are designed to cater to every corporate and individual who had an insurance need. This provides an impetus in increasing the companys growth and revenue potential by promoting our unique and unconventional approach and vision to a wider audience.
The second award, which was received for Product Innovation, was clinched for its life insurance product DeergaYou  an insurance plan that never retires. This innovative retirement plan made its mark as the first-ever product of its stature in the industry. This breakthrough product caters to the growing demand for a pension plan that secures the financial security of customers in their golden years by encouraging one to save regularly between the ages of 18 to 55 and thereafter benefit from an increasing monthly pension payment. Affordably priced to encourage everyone to set aside a small amount of their income, makes saving both convenient and easy on the wallet, in building a long-term fund.
The main intention of DeergaYou is to enable a dignified and financially independent retirement for its participants. Due to increasingly higher standards of healthcare and a greater awareness of the importance of healthy living, life expectancy has increased globally. With most expected to live well into their 70s, they must be prepared to face the challenge of sustaining themselves monetarily during this period not only food and drink but more prominently for medication and sustaining their lifestyles.
Increase in cost of living will be an added pressure on the savings accumulated. Therefore, retirement remains a taboo subject for many, signifying a drop or loss of income and change to ones standard of living. Thus, fashioning ones own private pension becomes more of a necessity than a comfort factor. A private pension will ensure an additional cash payment that supports their pension or investment income giving financial freedom in their golden years.
These accolades that have been evaluated by industry experts and recognizes ATLs creative and innovative spirit in key areas of marketing and operations at a national level, are a strong endorsement of our strategy and mission and reflects the companys commitment and passion to perform at the highest level, Ghaffoor further added.
The recently concluded Insurance Industry Awards made its debut entrance into the Sri Lankan arena in association with Fintelekt and the Insurance Association of Sri Lanka (IASL). It saw the participation of many movers and shakers of the local insurance industry vying to take top-notch positions is their selected categories which ranged from excellence in claims service, excellence in motor insurance, product and technology innovation, amongst others.

Court refuses restraining order on Paada Yathra, UNP recruitment
	
Attanagalle Magistrate Dinesh Lakmal Perera today refused to grant a restraining order to prevent the Joint Opposition from holding meetings in Nittambuwa on Sunday in line with its Paada Yathrawa and the United National Party (UNP) from conducting a membership recruitment drive during the weekend.
Nittambuwa Police OIC Prasanna Welikala filing a petition informed the Magistrate that the Paada Yathrawa led by former president MP Mahinda Rajapaksa was scheduled to arrive in Nittambuwa on Saturday and to hold a meeting on Sunday.
He said Attanagalle UNP Main Organiser Chandrasoma Sarathlal was also scheduled to conduct a membership recruitment drive during these two days.
The OIC had therefore, requested a restraining order banning both events saying the events could cause disturbance to the public.
Refusing the request, the Magistrate said the court had no authority to prevent events of a political party and noted that any party was entitled to act in a democratic manner.
However, the Magistrate said there was no restriction for the Police to carry out its duties according to the Police Ordinance. (Ananda E. Jayakody)

## Title: Hillary Clinton accepts Democratic nomination

Hillary Clinton accepts Democratic nomination
	
Making history as the first female major party nominee for president, Hillary Clinton said Thursday that America faces "a moment of reckoning" over the economy, terrorism, national unity, and the candidacy of Republican opponent Donald Trump.
"Powerful forces are threatening to pull us apart," Clinton said in her acceptance speech to a wildly cheering convention crowd, adding that "bonds of trust and respect are fraying" and all Americans "have to decide whether were going to work together so we can all rise together."
While arguing that her "primary mission" as president will be "more good jobs with rising wages right here in the United States," Clinton also plans to say that the nation faces a "stark" choice between her and Trump over national security.
Citing recent terrorist attacks in the U.S. and abroad by "determined enemies that must be defeated," Clinton plans to say: "No wonder people are anxious and looking for reassurance  looking for steady leadership."
Clinton, who was still working on her remarks as late as Thursday morning, was likely to echo domestic proposals she made during her successful primary campaign, aides said, an agenda ranging from increased college assistance to a higher minimum wage to equal pay for women in the workplace.
Eight years after losing her Democratic nomination race to Barack Obama, the former first lady, U.S. senator from New York and secretary of State also sought to reintroduce herself to the American people, with the help of testimonials from other speakers and a biographical film.
"She is going to lay out a case tonight about the constancy of the battles she's fought for children and families, about her own story, the people who have inspired her, those she's fought for," Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta told NPR News.
He said Clinton will "lay out a vision that we're stronger together, not when we try to divide each other, not running a campaign of bigotry as Donald Trump has done."
The Democratic nominee plans to invoke ideas she wrote about in the 1996 book It Takes A Village and to promote the theme of her 2016 campaign, "Stronger Together," campaign officials said.
Daughter Chelsea Clinton introduced the nominee before the speech, telling personal stories of their lives together and calling her mother "a fighter who never, ever gives up and who believes that we can always do better."
In the hours leading up to Clinton's appearance, the crowd at the Wells Fargo Center included supporters of Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, who challenged Clinton in Democratic primaries this year. Many of his allies wore hats and shirts adorned with a single word: "Bernie."
Clinton, accused by Sanders backers of not paying enough attention to the issue of income inequality, planned to say she will focus on areas of the country that have long "been left out and left behind" by the modern economy.
"From our inner cities to our small towns, Indian Country to Coal Country," read excerpts of her speech. "From the industrial Midwest to the Mississippi Delta to the Rio Grande Valley."
Sanders backers made their presence known throughout the evening.
At one point, as a group of veterans endorsed Clinton from the podium, some California delegates chanted "no more wars!" and "peace, not war!" Other Democrats sought to drown them out with "U-S-A.! U-S-A.!"
Clinton's acceptance speech ends a program featuring speeches by a procession of Democratic lawmakers, candidates and activists, spiced with musical performances by Carole King and Katy Perry. Clinton took the stage to the sounds of Perry's "Fight Song."
Various speakers throughout the night also assailed Trump.
Khizr Khan, the Muslim father of a U.S. soldier killed in post-9/11 military action, took aim at a Trump proposal to temporarily ban Muslims from entering the United States. His slain son may not have been allowed in the country under Trump policies, Khan said.
Asking Trump if he had ever read the U.S. Constitution, Khan pulled out a pocket book of the document and said: "I will gladly lend you my copy."
Preparing for the program, workers tested pyrotechnics, and King and Perry did sound checks. The arena roof featured nets filled with red, white and blue balloons, ready to be dropped on the nominee and her family after the speech.
The Clinton speech caps a four-day convention in which President Obama, Vice President Biden and ex-president and spouse Bill Clinton gave prime-time speeches praising their party's new nominee and condemning Trump as wholly unqualified for the presidency.
Trump did not stay idle as Clinton accepted her nomination Thursday. The Republican nominee campaigned in Iowa, where he again attacked "Crooked Hillary" as an unfit candidate who offers only a third term of the Obama administration.
In a written statement, the Republican candidate said Clinton and the Democrats live in a "fantasy world" that ignores the threat of Islamic State terrorism, porous borders with Mexico and millions of Americans who have stopped looking for work as bad trade deals send jobs overseas.
"I propose a different vision for America, one where we can break up Washingtons rigged system and empower all Americans to achieve their dreams," Trump said. "In our vision, we will put America first."

Speaking further, Lokuarachchi added, Whilst our micro insurance solutions address income security, the water stewardship programme is our contribution to society to provide physiological protection to folk who are otherwise exposed to inadequate water resources or in some instances the consumption of contaminated drinking water.

Kegalle Magistrate denies restraining order on paada yathrawa
	
Kegalle Magistrate Gayan Meegahage yesterday refused to grant the restraining order requested by the police seeking to prevent the paada yathrawa organised by the Joint Opposition from entering the Kegalle city limits from Karandupana.
HQI Kegalle Police had filled the petition on behalf of the police and cited several reasons why the procession should not pass through the city.
The HQI had stated that the president was scheduled to travel through Kegalle on July 29 and the march could create a public disturbance.
Police further stated that the UNP had planned to hold a propaganda campaign in Galigamuwa on the same day and that a clash could possibly occur between the two groups.
The magistrate asked the police whether the paada yathrawa had caused any disturbance to the public so far and whether a clash had occurred during the march so far. The police informed Court there had been no such incidents.
Subsequently, the magistrate had denied the request and given approval for the use of one lane for the paada yathrawa.
However, the magistrate had told the police to stop the protest march if there was a disturbance or clash and to inform the Court immediately if such should occur. (Rohan Kumara)

The Jana Satana Paada Yathrawa organised by the joint opposition will not break the historic partnership between the Sri Lanka Freedom Party led by President Maithripala Sirisena and the United National Party led by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, said Law and Order and Southern Development Minister Sagala Ratnayaka yesterday.
Issuing a statement, the minister said:
"If at all, the march is an effort to destroy the marriage that took place on January 8, 2015 between the people of the country and the idea of democracy.
As far as we are concerned this is nothing more than a political gimmick by a bunch of crooks. Their followers will realise soon enough that this is not about the nation or the people but an act of desperation on the part of a few individuals who are being prosecuted for multiple infringements of the law, including financial crimes and murder.
"However, in line with the promises we have made to the people of this country, we will continue to uphold the principles of democracy; in this case the right to protest. In fact the government will do its best to provide the maximum security possible to those who take part in this protest, meaningless though it is and misled though the protesters are.
"Unlike during the previous regime, there wont be hooligans and thugs disrupting this march. There wont be baton-charging and there wont be water cannon. There wont be tear gas.
"Having said that, we would like to remind the organisers of this protest that a healthy democracy also includes the rule of law. No protest, however justifiable, warrants the breaking of the law. Just as much as we are mandated to uphold the principles of democracy, so too are we obliged to ensure that the rule of law is not compromised."

The students who passed out from the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM) in Malabe are ready to face an open exam conducted by the Ministry of Health or the Ministry of Higher Education similar to the exams of State medical faculties.
This was said by a student named Tharindu Ruwanpathiranage, a student who had passed out with the first batch of students of SAITM, at a press conference held at the Neville Fernando Private Hospital where SAITM students are presently carrying out their clinical studies.
Tharindu said their parents directed them to the SAITM with the knowledge that the institution could offer him a proper education.
He raised a question from those who oppose them being registered as doctors whether more than 82% of A/L students who lose the chance to enter the medical faculty should give up on their dream of becoming a doctor in the future.
He said that if not for an organization like SAITM, a portion of the 82% listed above would be compelled to seek foreign medical degrees or lose the chance to follow their dream.
Meanwhile, the CEO of the SAITM and NFTH, Dr. Sameera Senarthne said they were willing to hold discussions with Higher Education Minister Lakshman Kiriella regarding his proposal to run the SAITM as a Public Private Partnership (PPP).
However, he said they have not yet been officially informed of this proposal of the government. (Piyumi Fonseka)

The owner of a tourist hotel in Akuressa and five others were taken into custody by the Matara Division Women and Childrens Bureau last morning on the charge of rape of a 13-year-old girl. Three hotel mangers and a woman who aided and abetted the crime were among them.
Sources said the officials of the bureau had to search at least six hotels in the area to arrest the suspects. Earlier, the Pitabeddara Police had arrested seven suspects involved in the incident.

Meanwhile, a senior police officer stated that a man in robes who was also involved in the incident had fled the area.

WP minister wants extra grade 1 classroom in 21 schools: CTU
	
Ceylon Teachers Union (CTU) today charged that Western Province Education Minister Ranjith Somawansa had ordered the Provincial Education Director to add another classroom to grade one in 21 schools located in Western Province to facilitate the whims of provincial council members.
Provincial Minister Somawansa had reportedly instructed the Western Provincial Education Director to add one more class room because of the congestion in grade one class rooms in 21 selected schools.
However, the Ceylon Teachers Union (CTU) raised a question as to why another class room is to be added to schools that are identified as being congested.
I have received many requests from my provincial council members claiming that there are many children who were being deprived of their schooling due to the congestion that exists in grade one class rooms. According to the court order, the number of students in grade one cannot exceed 40. Therefore, several selected schools will be chosen for this upgrade, Provincial Minister Somawansa had stated in the letter.
CTU General Secretary Joseph Stalin charged that the decision had been taken to admit children whose parents had paid kickbacks to provincial council members.
Ashoka Vidyalaya- Colombo 8, Dharmapala Primary School Kottawa, Horana Thakshila Maha Vidyalaya, Nugegoda Samudradevi Balika Vidyalaya and Yasodara Devi Balika Maha Vidyalaya Gampaha were mentioned as being among the 21 schools chosen for this purpose.
When inquired by the Daily Mirror, Provincial Minister Somawansas Private Secretary S. A. Liyanage said that the letter prepared to be sent by the provincial minister to the Provincial Education Director had 'gone missing' before it was finalised.
He said Mr. Somawansa had called for an inquiry to investigate as to how the letter was leaked to the public. (Piyumi Fonseka)
