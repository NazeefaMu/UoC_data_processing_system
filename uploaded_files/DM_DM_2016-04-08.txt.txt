Alternate highway exits for festive season
	
The Highways Ministry today predicted of possible traffic congestion at the exit points on the Southern Expressway during the New Year season between April 08 and 13 and April 15 and 18 and advised the motorists to use alternate exit points to avoid traffic congestion.
The Ministry asked motorists using the Expressway between April 08 and 13 to reach the Godagama exit point avoiding peak hours (from 5.00 a.m. to 10.00 a.m. and from 4.00 p.m. to 9.00 p.m.) and to use alternate exit points if it was informed of a traffic congestion at Godagama exit point via Video Message Services (VMS) or other media to avoid possible traffic congestion.
Considerable traffic congestion is expected to occur at the Godagama exit point if many vehicles arrived here in a short period as there are only three exits there.
The Ministry requested motorists to retain the entrance ticket when arriving at the exit point and bring change cash to avoid delays.
Motorists were advised to exit from Pinnaduwa and drive up to Dewata or exit from the Imaduwa exit point and reach Weligama through Kananke, or exit from Kokmaduwa exit point and reach Ahangama and enter Galle road to travel towards Matara.
Heavy traffic congestion is likely to occur at the Kottawa Interchange between April 15 and 18, as vehicles arriving towards Colombo may increase and the Ministry has advised to use alternate exit points avoiding the Kottawa Interchange if notified via VMS of traffic congestion.
Motorists could exit from Kahathuduwa exit point and reach Colombo through Horana road or exit from Athurugiriya exit point and use Malabe-Athurugiriya road or exit from Kothalawala exit point and enter Malabe-Kaduwela road or exit from Kaduwela exit point and enter Colombo-Hanwella road to reach Colombo.
The ministry also advised the motorists to adhere to security procedures when using the expressway specially avoiding driving under the influence of liquor, and exceeding the speed limit of 100 kmph.
The speed limit is requested to be reduced to 60 kmph in rainy conditions. Motorists are advised to stick to the left lane and enter the right lane only when overtaking and return to the left lane after travelling a distance of about 50 metres.
Motorists could obtain information regarding traffic congestion and other matters from the Galanigama Traffic Control Centre by dialling 1969 round the clock. (Ajith Siriwardana)

Code of conduct for MPs
	
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya yesterday presented a draft of Code of Conduct for MPs and asked them to submit their views on it within two weeks.
An MP, found guilty of unethical behavior, will be subjected to sanctions including suspension from Parliament for a specific period not exceeding the limit set by the Parliamentary Powers and Privileges Act.
Also, a member can be subjected to any other sanction prescribed by the Supreme Court on a matter referred to it by Parliament under the same Act. Censure and reprimand are the other forms of sanctions set out as punishments for MPs who act in contravention of this code.
The code will be enforced under the Standing Orders of Parliament. Once it is approved, the present Committee on Privileges is to be renamed as the Committee on Privileges and Ethics. This committee can seek assistance from experts if necessary in cases against the MPs.
Based on its recommendations, Parliament can decide on necessary action. Any person can complain against the misconduct of an MP. However, it has to be done through another MP in the form of a motion. Afterwards, the Speaker will decide whether it should be forwarded to the committee or not. The complainant has to declare his identity and supportive evidence.
The draft says complaints made on unsubstantiated media reports will not be entertained. The committee can drop the case if it is a prima facie.
According to the code, MPs should not assault harass or intimidate another person. The MPs are supposed to exercise civility and use appropriate parliamentary language. A member should use public funds, property and facilities only in the public interest. It is prohibited for them to accept any form of inducements. (Kelum Bandara and Yohan Perera)

Increase in ministers essential to run National Govt.:  Musthapha
	
The increase of ministers was essential to carry out the duties of a national government, Provincial Councils and Local Government Minister Faiszer Musthapha said today.
Addressing a media briefing, Minister Musthapha said even though ministerial appointments were given when the Rajapaksa regime was in power by dividing parties, the present government offers ministerial portfolios within the party.
There is a limitation in offering ministerial portfolios in a national government. Those limits are decided by Parliament, he added.
Meanwhile he said the Local Government Elections cannot be conducted in certain provinces which were free of delimitation issues as per the claims made by the UPFA General Secretary Mahinda Amaraweera.
He also said several institutions including Peoples Action for Free and Fair Elections (PAFFREL) had requested that the Local Government Elections be held in areas in which the delimitation process had concluded.
We cannot hold the election immediately. There is a certain procedure to follow. Therefore let me make preparations for the elections according to that procedure, he added.
He said there were legal issues to hold the Local Government Election in selected provinces which were free of delimitation issues. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)

Plan to systematically expel JVP- Lal Kantha
	
JVP Politburo member K.D. Lal Kantha claimed that there is a plan to systematically expel the JVP from national politics through an election system and the party already held discussions with President Maithripala Sirisena in this regard.
We met the President to clarify about the election system as we felt that he is not aware of many things, he said addressing a Farmers' Conference in Dambulla on Thursday.
He said the President had questioned him recently at another Farmers' Conference in Dambulla asking when they intend to stage protests in Colombo again. It was then that he had decided to talk to the President, together with the farmers present at the conference.
Our members of Parliament and the Pradeshiya Sabhas have become a problem to the capitalist class, especially when we take up issues relating to the numerous instances of foreign travel by them. Therefore, they have started preparations to expel us through an election constitution, he added.

Minister Wijewardene further said that military security was not given even to President Maithripala Sirisena, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe or to himself as the State Minister of Defence.
The State Minister emphasized that tri-forces security should be provided not for VIPs, but for the national security.
According to the Security Councils decision to withdraw military security from VIPs, no politician will be provided with military security hereafter, the minister added.
