A change of scene for her!
	

The Green Party leadership has asked the young and dainty fair member in the council whether she is willing to shift her political base to Ratmalana.

The fair one elected to the council on the Green party ticket had been keeping a low profile for some time. And it was rumored recently that she had decided to quit politics for good.
A stalwart from the Green party is expected to meet the fair one shortly to discuss with her the proposition coming from the party hierarchy, they say.

Anti-SAITM protest tomorrow
	
The education, petroleum and healthcare sectors countrywide are likely to be disrupted tomorrow because of anti-SAITM protests to be conducted by a trade union alliance led by the GMOA.
According to the GMOA, those in the ayurvedic and dental sectors including nurses are also expected to join them in a picketing campaign outside the Colombo National Hospital.
It said some 15 teacher and principal associations would go on sick leave during the day while the medical faculty lecturers and a group of university lecturers and students have threatened to boycott classes.
The GMOA said petroleum unions would picket outside the Orugodawatte and Kollonnawa Oil Refineries against the privatization of the countrys education sector.
We urge the government to abolish SAITM and stop the move to privatize the countrys health and education, GMOA Assistant Secretary Naveen De Soysa told a news briefing today.
He said the boycott was warning to the government to resolve this matter without delay.

At U.N., Trump says U.S. may have to totally destroy North Korea
	

REUTERS, 19 September, 2017 
U.S. President Donald Trump said on Tuesday that the United States will be forced to totally destroy North Korea unless Pyongyang backs down from its nuclear challenge, mocking North Korean leader Kim Jong Un as a rocket man on a suicide mission. 
Loud murmurs filled the green-marbled U.N. General Assembly hall when Trump issued his sternest warning yet to North Korea, whose ballistic missile launches and nuclear tests have rattled the globe. 
Unless North Korea backs down, he said, We will have no choice than to totally destroy North Korea. 
Rocket man is on a suicide mission for himself and his regime, he said. 
North Koreas mission to the United Nations did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Trumps remarks. A junior North Korean diplomat remained in the delegations front-row seat for Trumps speech, the North Korean U.N. mission said.

Bangladesh frets about population boom in Rohingya camps
	

DAILY MAIL, 19 September, 2017 
Bangladesh has launched a birth control drive in its overcrowded Rohingya refugee camps, an official said Tuesday, fearing a population boom would worsen the humanitarian crisis unfolding along its border. 
Family planning teams have been deployed to offer advice and distribute condoms and other contraceptives throughout its ill-equipped camps, which have been overwhelmed by the arrival of 420,000 Rohingya refugees since August 25. 
Authorities have already identified 70,000 new or expectant mothers among the latest influx from Myanmar, and fear without intervention the population pressures could worsen in coming months as the crisis drags on. 
They have six, seven, eight, nine, 10 children, said Pintu Kanti Bhattacharjee, head of the governments family planning department in Coxs Bazar district where the camps are located. 
Bangladesh is building a large new camp to accommodate hundreds of thousands of these new arrivals fleeing violence across the border, but space is stretched very thin.

Central Expressway: Agreement to be signed with Taisai next week
	
Highways Minister Lakshman Kiriella said today the agreement to hand over the construction work on the Central Expressway would be signed with the Japanese Company, Taisai next week.
He told a news conference that the Cabinet had approved the decision to do so.
The minister said there had been no malpractice in the tender procedure and that they were able to reduce the Taisai bid from Rs.159 billion to Rs.134.9 billion after discussions.
He said the work on the Central Expressways was to have begun in August last year but it was delayed because of the tender procedure.
"The previous government gave contracts on building expressways without any tender procedures," the minister said.
He said some people were opposed to building the central expressway and recalled that the UNP government planned to construct it in 2002 but was unable to do so because the then government was toppled.
The minister said he was not prepared to respond to COPE Chairman Sunil Hadunnetti, who did not have any expert knowledge on expressways but would do so should the Attorney General raise any queries on any matter.
He said MP Handunnetti could question him on financial matters connected to the expressway only after the relevant accounts were tabled in parliament and based on the AG's observations on it. (Ajith Siriwardana and Yohan Perera)

Central Mexico earthquake kills more than 130, topples buildings
	
Rescuers combed through rubble Tuesday after a powerful earthquake killed scores and collapsed buildings in Mexico City and surrounding states on the anniversary of a devastating earthquake decades ago.
At least 139 people died in the magnitude-7.1 earthquake, officials said. Most deaths were reported in Puebla, Morelos and Mexico states, and Mexico City, the capital.
Video showed rescue workers in hard hats and civilians in a Mexico City neighborhood digging through two story-tall piles of rubble. Some carried away buckets full of debris. Volunteers called out the names of those possibly trapped under collapsed buildings. Windows buckled and shattered, falling several stories to the ground.
President Enrique Pea Nieto said 27 buildings collapsed in the capital, which is about 75 miles from the epicenter, CNN affiliate Foro TV reported.
Hours before the quake hit, many people took part in drills and commemorative events on the anniversary of the devastating earthquake that killed thousands in Mexico City in 1985. Residents realized Tuesday's earthquake wasn't a drill when rooms trembled.
Preliminary reports put the epicenter 2.8 miles (4.5 kilometers) east-northeast of San Juan Raboso and 34.1 miles (55 km) south-southwest of the city of Puebla, in Puebla state, according to the US Geological Survey.
The earthquake struck at a depth of about 33 miles (51 km).
"Anything below 70 kilometers is considered a shallow quake," CNN meteorologist Allison Chinchar said. "That's important, because shallow earthquakes often cause the most damage, compared to the ones that are deeper, regardless of the strength. But this also was a relatively strong earthquake."

Confessions of a true bibliophile
	
Eric Ilayaparachchis books are deceptive to look at. His non-fiction works and literary criticism, at any rate, are sometimes slim. But the amount of information packed into 100 pages or so would be voluminous. Mage Pustakala (My Libraries) a recent book by this prolific author, is typical.
This 120 page book reads like a guided tour of every library which ever existed in Sri Lanka plus several from around the world. If the author has missed a few, it may be because here is a writer in a mighty hurry, even as he leafs through books, manuscripts, lives and anecdotes and an infinite number of book shelves. 
His quest begins in Negombo, the authors place of birth, and shifts through Colombo, Galle and other towns and then on to India, Sweden and Washington DC. Along with these, there are the one-man collections often leading a perilous existence, reflecting the precarious nature of their owners lives  from the friend forced to sell part of his invaluable collection every time he moves from one boarding house to another, to those waging heroic struggles with leaking roofs, mice, silverfish and financial drain... but never admitting defeat. 
Piles of books crowd this area like tiles on the ground after a roof is dismantled. The authors love of and feel for books is obvious; you can actually smell them. But, in the authors view, people are as important  the people whose home libraries often vanished with them, dusty collections looking for book loving owners in vain. From obscure librarians to poets, scholars, activists and national heroes, book lovers are the authors truest heroes, their books the dusty, yellowing armoury with which they battled ignorance and intellectual oblivion. 
One can discern a degree of romanticizing here. But Eric Illayaparachchi is a romantic writer, and that is to his credit. Many of the best known works of the worlds classical literature were written by romantics
One thing leads to another. Close to the Negombo home where Eddie Jayamanne and Rukmani Devi lived, Sinhala scholar Don Abiram Gamhewa had his ancestral home filled with books. This area is associated with Munidasa Kumaratunga and Walisinha Harischandra as well. In other words, libraries abounded. At the Gamhewa household, the author discovers an early American edition of Fontamara, a work by Italian novelist and politician Ignazio Silone (Secondino Tranquilli)  the sort of book left alone by ladies reading Victorian novels. This is in addition to works by Hela Havula writers, and a copy of The Worlds Best Photographs owned by D. A. Gamhewa. 
He starts his search as a schoolboy, when in a Buddhist temple, a chance encounter with a disused book collection makes a deep impression on him. In the Catholic school run by French friars where he first studied, his Sinhala teacher introduced him to Sinhala fiction with a book titled Muwantissa Kumaraya. The school library was his first foray into the magical world of the printed word. 

There was a library in the neighbouring house, in the village of Mahimagodella, where the author grew up. It housed an English school, an ayurvedic hospital and surgery (English grammar taught while surgeries were performed), and a well-stocked library where the author glimpsed Marxs Das Kapital for the first time. 
The 1971 April rebellion taught him that books too, can be a matter of life and death. It was a lesson about the real world, its violence and irrationality; an aunt whose son was arrested panicked and buried his books, including Maxim Gorkys short stories and an American thriller. But the rebellion released a wave of intellectual vitality. Rehabilitation camps became centres of learning, and courtrooms were transformed into forums of intellectual debate. 
Piles of books crowd this area like tiles on the ground after a roof is dismantled. The authors love of and feel for books is obvious; you can actually smell them. But, in the authors view, people are as important  the people whose home libraries often vanished with them
Studying at a mixed school, he goes with his female classmates to watch Lester James Pieris Gamperaliya at a Negombo cinema, and realises that the cinema too, is a potent art medium. But Colombo, its libraries and other wonders make a big impression on a provincial young man. As he writes: 
Anyone visiting Colombo in the late 70s or early 80s would see a cultural metropolis packed with pleasing bookshops, printing presses, newspaper stalls brimming with newspapers and magazines, pavement vendors and small shops specializing in second hand books, cinemas with huge billboards, theatres staging original plays or translations every day, music rooms reminiscent of Jalsagar, and libraries. 
Wimaladharma Bros. in front of the harbour told the correct time to everyone. The BCC Companys Sovereign Bar Soap helped wash the dirt off the nations clothes. Rani Soap from the Swadeshi factory added fragrance to the female body. The Sri Lanka Transport Boards single and double deckers, the latter with footboards as spacious as verandahs provided ample transport within the city. 
This was a time when Martin Wickremasinghe, G. B. Senanayake, Mahagamasekara, T. G. W. Silva, Deeman Ananda, Karunasena Jayalath, Henry Jayasena, Sugathapala de Silva, Rohan Joseph, Rukmani Devi, George Keyt and Jeffrey Bawa frequented Colombo. Walls were filled with theatre posters printed in the linoleum presses of the I. P. B. Press, using technical know-how derived from the Peoples Republic of China of Mao Tse Tung and Shanmugadasan. They were designed by Ralex Ranasinghe to be read not just from close up but even from a moving bus window. The Colombo of that era was truly a Paris without an Eiffel tower. 
One can discern a degree of romanticizing here. But Eric Illayaparachchi is a romantic writer, and that is to his credit. Many of the best known works of the worlds classical literature were written by romantics. Joseph Conrad was one. Several of his important works were based in the Malay Peninsula. Conrad has been accused of romanticizing the Malays, but his descriptions of the geography, locale and people there beats anything Ive read or seen since, from novels to travel books. 
Though we are discussing non-fiction here, the same rule applies and honestly, this country and its literature could do with a little, honest romanticizing since much of the locally-produced writing about it tends to be drab. It is noteworthy too, that the author has tackled an unusual subject for Sri Lanka. In Western writing, libraries are a common subject. It is uncommon here, and this author may well be the first to write a book on that theme. These are the confessions of a true bibliophile. 
He takes us to the time when the United States Information Centre housed a magnificent library in an equally magnificent building along Flower Road, where Muhammad Alis biography was on exhibit near the front door and William Faulkner, Edgar Allan Poe and Mark Twain gained precedence over Ernest Hemingway; people listened to LP records of classical music, John F. Kennedys speeches and poetry readings by Robert Frost seated in its spacious foyer. 
The author notes how the left-wing Samasamaja movement (word coined by Jayantha Weerasekara) encouraged book reading and learning and pioneered translations of books from Marx and Lenin to Hugo, Dumas and Russian classical authors by translators such as Dedigama V. Rodrigo, Cyril C. Perera, Charitha Wijeratne and M. Senarath Yapa. In this regard, it resembled the 19th century British working class which worked hard to progress intellectually through self-study and night classes. Activist and Colombo-era poet Meepura Saraths Negombo library housed works ranging from Hemingway to Marx and Ernesto Guevara. 
Bella Vista, mansion of the former Nizam of Hyderabad, housed a splendid library whose librarian, an English-medium poet, gorges on books and knowledge like a corpulent chef dining on his own delicacies, and reading becomes an endless game of musical chairs for the author. 
In a sleepy Swedish town, he discovers bookshops displaying a marble bust of August Strindberg and the Swedish translation of Michael Oondajtes English Patient. Talking about Ingmar Bergman, he concludes that the Swedish film maker is better known in Colombo than there. Inside the Smithsonian in Washington DC, he discovers a bronze copy of King Johns Magna Carta and Greek iron nails boasting of ties to Socrates. 
In Basra, Iraq, librarian Alia Muhammad saved a priceless library of 30,000 books with the help of Anis, a caf owner, friends and neighbours. As Basra and the library were burned, the books were hidden in Anis caf (he guarded them with a gun) till they found safe homes elsewhere. 
This book reveals a cosmopolitan world of books and provides us with a map of our biblio history and its highlights. Just as importantly, it is a record of those unsung, forgotten heroes who, thorough their writings or their personal libraries, struggled to keep minds and intellectual curiosity alive, not an easy task in a country where its all too easy to believe that progress is principally a question of devoting ones free time to television, the telephone or social media, using their most facile components at that, with gossip as the common denominator. In that context, each library mentioned, big or small, amounts to an act of heroism.

FBI secretly wiretapped ex-Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort
	

US, (Daily Mail), 19 September 2017 - 
FBI investigators wiretapped formerTrump campaign chairman Paul Manafort in the months before and after the election and told him they plan to indict him, according to two sensational reports.  CNN claims that Manafort was the subject of electronic surveillance under a secret court order in 2016 and the start of 2017 as part of an investigation into his ties to Russia. Separately, two prosecutors working for Special Counsel Robert Mueller told Manafort that they plan to indict him after a raid on his home in July, according to the New York Times. 
It marks another two dramatic developments in Robert Muellers probe into alleged Russian meddling in the election, and also comes after President Trump tweeted in March about alleged wiretapping of his phones. According to the CNN report, the FBI began investigating the Republican operative in 2014 because of his work with Party of the Regions, a centrist pro-Russia political party of Ukraine. 
Manafort stepped down from the campaign in August of 2016 following reports that he accepted payments from when he worked in Ukraine for the Party of the Regions.

Fitch rates LB Finances senior and subordinated debt
	
Fitch Ratings has assigned LB Finance PLCs (LB; A-(lka)/Stable) proposed senior, unsecured and subordinated debentures expected national long-term ratings of A-(lka)(EXP) and BBB+(lka)(EXP), respectively.
The issuance is to total Rs.3 billion, with the debentures to mature in five years and carry fixed coupons. The debentures are to be listed on the Colombo Stock Exchange. LB expects to use the proceeds to fund loan book growth, reduce asset and liability maturity mismatches and to improve its Tier II capital base.
The final ratings on the debentures are subject to the receipt of final documentation conforming to information already received.
The proposed senior debentures are rated at the same level as LBs national long-term rating as they constitute unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of the company. The proposed subordinated debentures are rated one notch below its national long-term rating to reflect the subordination to its senior unsecured obligations.
The rating of LB captures its established franchise and satisfactory levels of capital, which are supported by sound profitability through its higher-yielding products. These are counterbalanced by its relatively higher risk appetite as seen from its exposure to gold-backed lending. The rating also reflects increasing liquidity risk, which could reduce its liquidity buffer.

For and against from the same source!
	

The new revenue bill introduced by the yahapalanaya government triggered a controversy in the country from the very inception.

The JO in particular found this bill a handy weapon to attack the government with. They charged that the government was trying to transplant into our fiscal system a revenue collecting strategy borrowed from another country lock, stock and barrel. The JO assigned to their economics wizkid, the former tuition master, the job of launching a frontal attack on the new bill when taken up for debate in the council.
Determined to tear the bill into smithereens with razor-sharp points, the JO economics wizkid approached a highly qualified economist attached to a university in the outskirts of the city. Please give me a briefing on all the negative aspects of this bill, he told the university don.
The university don who had already studied the bill briefed the JO wizkid on the defects, shortcomings and the fundamental flaws in the proposed act which, he said, could lead to serious repercussions if placed on the statute.
Meanwhile, a government high-up, a doctor himself, too called on the same university academic and sought an analysis of the bill highlighting the merits of the bill.
The academic marshalling his best possible analytical skills briefed his politico-friend on the merits of the bill and the far reaching benefits to accrue from it once it was in operation and the contribution it would make towards placing the countrys economy on an even keel.
Fortified with the academics analysis, the yahapalanaya high-up left for the council fully confident he could easily quash the arguments to be put forward by the Opposition.
When the debate on the bill came up in the council a few days later, the JO wizkid was up firing all his guns at the bill. When his turn to take the floor came, the yahapalanaya doctor fired salvo after salvo destroying the arguments adduced by the JO wizkid.
However, both protagonists did not know they were using ammunition acquired from the same source!

Its time that  Sri Lanka addresses marine pollution!
	
Sri Lanka is embellished with its spanned coastal belt which ranges about 1,640 km. The coastal belt also includes 82 lagoons. Even though we are fortunate to have such an attractive surrounding, the risk of polluting Sri Lankas ocean has increased rapidly. This is due to the impact of pollutants. We see these beautiful places being polluted due to the presence of a large amount of non-degradable waste and increasing population.
Plastic production increasing drastically in the world is providing a serious threat to the marine environment. At the same time, the sea around Sri Lanka is also contaminated due to poisonous chemicals, being released through factories, and the leaking of oil, from vessels. Therefore these pollutants have adversely affected the sea and brings a threat to the lives of species, coral reefs and the people as well. 
Marine pollution can be simply defined as releasing of waste in to the sea thereby affecting the quality of the ocean environment. These polluting activities give rise to unhealthy conditions with regard to all organisms including humans. Sea pollution happens in two ways: Sea- based Pollution and Land-based Pollution.
Sea-based Pollution occurs as a result of the sea being contaminated due to oil and fuel leaked from vessels, smoke emitted from ships and the releasing of ballast water. Land-based Pollution happens mainly as a result of fishing activities and the tourism industry. Being an island nation, the ocean plays a vital role in regard to the existence of its people. 
The main reasons for sea pollution
Waste generated in both landbased activities and sea-based activities 
	The discharge of oil/chemical during transportation of oil and accidents in the sea, offshore oil exploration facilities, disposal of non-degradable litter substances. 
	The use of non-degradable waste. 
	Increasing population 
	Debris generated from numerous human activities including tourism. 
	Fisheries and other related events. 
	Releasing Ballast water  
	Smoke emitted from vessels 
	Faces released through pipes 
Marine Environment Protection Authority (MEPA) General Manager Dr. Terney Pradeep Kumara told Daily Mirror that the sea in general is polluted with 6.4 million tonnes of waste annually. He added that the sea around Sri Lanka was polluted with 1.59mn tones of waste. The common waste items that can be found in the coast of Sri Lanka are grocery bags, plastic bottles, drinking straws, bottle caps, glass bottles, rigifoam and cigarette butts.
The breakdown of waste products found around Sri Lanka annually amounts to 41% plastic, 34% fishing nets, 4% glass and 14% other effluents. This waste that accumulates is not merely from Sri Lanka, but comes from neighbouring countries like India, Thailand and Indonesia. Therefore, a sustainable solution is needed to control the release of waste to the sea, Dr. Kumara said. 
If we assume that the waste collected at the sea is 100%, the majority of it, exactly 90%, comes from inside the country. What the coast contributes amounts to exactly 10%. Although 14.6 million people reside in the coastal areas, a large amount of waste is released from the centre of the country, he added.
 
The solution to tackle marine debris lies with the people who dump garbage haphazardly in to the sea. Therefore people should be educated at different phases. They must be briefed about matters such as encouraging the reduction of using single use plastics and waste segregation, recycling and beachclean ups.
While solid waste management has been in the spotlight, we cant ignore marine pollution merely because its sometimes out of sight and thus out of mind. 
MEPA Chairman Rear Admiral (Rtd) Rohana Perera said that President Maithripala Sirisena had declared the third week of September as the National Coastal and Marine Environment Protection Week in keeping with the International Coastal Cleanup Day.
Accordingly, the Marine Environment Protection Authority (MEPA), together with Governmental and non-governmental organisations and the private sector, have planned to launch a series of programmes from September 15 to 22 covering the entire coastal belt of Sri Lanka. This initiative focuses on empowering the fisheries and tourism industries to keep the sea pollution-free.
The Government and its entities have shown some interest and enthusiasm in looking in to the marine pollution in Sri Lanka and thus initiated programmes to clean the coastal areas which will be followed by consulting programmes involving the people, Perera said.
Meanwhile, the Department of Coast Conservation and Coastal Resource Management (DCCCRM) Director General Prabhath Chandrakeerthi said during a press briefing that the coastal cleanup programs were launched in the relevant districts covering the entire sea belt. 
Districts programmes will be held at 75 locations in 14 coastal districts during the week. Each of these programmes will comprise an inaugural session, coastal cleanup and a survey on marine debris collected at the sites. We have also invited students, from 288 schools situated along the coastal belt, and people to join us and make this event a success. Officials from the DCCCRM, Civil Defence Department, Sri Lanka Navy and 13 other institutions are expected to participate in this programme, Chandrakeerthi said.
Its noteworthy that the conservation of the marine environment depends on how keen we are in disposing garbage at appropriate places. If we are careless in dumping waste, it is we who will suffer in the long run. Therefore, lets start from the smallest unit which is our home, so as to address maritime pollution.
The common waste items that can be found in the coast of Sri Lanka are grocery bags, plastic bottles, drinking straws, bottle caps, glass bottles, rigifoam and cigarette butts

At least 139 people have been confirmed dead after 7.1-magnitude earthquake hit Mexico, causing gas line explosions, toppling buildings and forcing thousands to be evacuated into the street. The tremor hit just hours after emergency drills around the nation on the anniversary of another devastating quake that killed thousands in Mexico City in 1985. Today's quake hit near the Puebla state town of Raboso, about 76 miles southeast of Mexico City, at a depth of 32 miles, the US Geological Survey said. Horrifying images coming out of the country's capital show rubble strewn across roads and enormous chunks of collapsed buildings, while volunteers search through rubble for survivors. It comes just days after another powerful quake - measuring 8.1 - hit Mexico, killing at least 98 people. (Daily Mail)

Monster Hurricane Maria devastates Dominica and its getting STRONGER
	

Hurricane Maria, newly intensified into a dangerous Category 5 storm, pounded the small island of Dominica as it surged into the eastern Caribbean on Monday night. 
Its winds reached sustained maximum speeds of 160mph as it plowed into the tiny country - and forecasters warned it might become even stronger, the latest blow in the worst hurricane season for
seven years. 
Maria is now following a similar path to Irma, with many of the islands already devastated by that storm expecting to be hit on Tuesday, with a direct strike on Puerto Rico possible on Wednesday. As it tore up Dominica, the countrys prime minister, Roosevelt Skerrit, posted on Facebook: My roof is gone. I am at the complete mercy of the hurricane. House is flooding. The winds are merciless! We shall survive by the grace of God, Skerrit had written an hour earlier in what became a series of increasingly harrowing posts. 
A few minutes later, he messaged he could hear the sound of galvanized steel roofs tearing off houses on the small rugged island. 
He then wrote that he thought his home had been damaged. And three words: Rough! Rough! Rough! 
Finally, he posted: I havebeen rescued.  Those were the first official words from the tiny, 290-square-mile island nation after the eye wall moved ashore. 
Prior to being struck, Dominicas authorities had closed schools and government offices and urged people to move from dangerous areas to shelters.

11 months of data missing from Mahendrans phone
	
Additional Solicitor General Yasantha Kodagoda yesterday said that according to the experts who conducted the extraction of data from Arjuna Mahendrans mobile phone, data pertaining a considerable time period (approximately 11 months), which coincide with the mandated period of the Presidential Commission of Inquiry, could not be located.
It was revealed that the Commission had asked in a letter to Arjuna Mahendran to provide details in this regard and some other matters as well.
The letter had been handed over to the Counsel who was appearing on behalf of him yesterday morning.
The Commission wanted a clarification from Mahendran on this missing data. (Shehan Chamika Silva)

More talk could cause more damage!
	

A political authority in the highest echelons recently got his aides to arrange a meeting with the foreign media personnel to brief them on the topical national issues in the country and the government s stand on them. And a date and time for the event was immediately set.

However, to everyones surprise, an official communique was issued last week-end announcing that the proposed meeting with foreign media personnel was cancelled.
The discreet inquiries made by interested parties in this regard have brought to light the real reason for the cancellation of the proposed meeting: the fear that the questions likely to be asked at the proposed briefing would place the hosts in a tight spot. The Media Ministry mandarins had pointed out to Number One that the foreign media men would for sure seek clarification on matters like the governments stand on a former army commanders much publicized assertion about the war crimes and the conflicting views on the proposed Constitution and other important issues being expressed by various purohitas. This being the situation, the outcome of such a meeting with foreign media is likely to cause more damage than good to the governments image, the mandarins had explained.
Number One had accepted this advice and that led to the cancellation of the meeting, they say.

## Title: No Corporal Punishment Please!

No Corporal Punishment Please!
	
In all my years as a teacher and later as a Principal, I have never allowed myself or any member of my Staff to touch a child either in anger or affection. Of course the latter has become somewhat obsolete given that children are less inhibited nowadays and have no difficulty showing affection even to supposedly staid teachers specially when exam results are announced 
I once had the unexpected but totally heart warming experience of a very shy girl throwing her arms round me and kissing me firmly and warmly on the cheek when I told her she had been awarded a full scholarship to Yale. Now that I can excuse! But what of actual corporal punishment It is too common nowadays and instances of downright cruelty can be read in the press all the time. 
During my school days in various countries, gentle nuns and other well controlled teachers never once showed a tendency to smack any of us although I must confess that my piano teacher did occasionally tap my knuckles with a ruler. I didnt like it. It certainly did not push me to practise harder or to play any better. Indeed I must ask this question Has Corporal Punishment ever been known to have enhanced performances in Studies, Sports or the Arts It has not. It has had the very opposite effect with a tremendous psychological backlash as well. 
It was just a few days ago that I read, to my surprise. that according to a caveat in Penal Code 314 teachers were able to get away with thrashing pupils (if it was done in good faith) and if they were behaving with reasonable discretion. Now those words cover almost every kind of corporal punishment. What is reasonable to one may not be so to another. Who judges the reasonableness] of corporal punishment 
That little caveat can and probably does allow downright sadism to take place and the Daily Press constantly tells us of such instances of punishments way beyond their reasonable use. 
We did not have too much coeducation in Colombo in the 1940s and 50s. We knew that the boys of our sister school at S. Thomas were being regularly caned by Warden de Saram and others. We knew this because our brothers, cousins and occasionally even boyfriends told us so. (we, girls privately thought it an excellent idea that irritating brothers and unfaithful others were being soundly thrashed). The boys seemed to think it was all in a days work if they were caned for not doing homework, skipping choir practice and other offences which would be probably overlooked today with just a verbal reprimand. Sometimes Warden de Saram, Head of S. Thomas would hand the caning over to another master. The boys looked forward to a particularly lenient one who interpreted the order to cane in his own way. 
So here you are again, Mr. Wise would say genially to the young culprit in his office who was On Report for the third time that term. 
He would then take three steps back, take a little run up to the boy bent over his desk with his bottom in the air, and tap him gently on the back. He would repeat this three or four times. 
You have been caned now| he would say to a very surprised first offender, so run along to class. 
He was predictably one of the most popular teachers in the school. His brilliant teaching was a bonus. 
Caning can leave scars; often deep scars. In fact all physical punishment leaves scars. A father who regularly abuses his children (I do not mean sexually) will have underperforming sons and daughters with only himself to blame. The trouble is that such fathers rarely blame themselves. It is always the fault of the school and never the fault of the home. And often a long suffering wife bears the onus of her childs lack of interest in his school studies.. 
A parent out of control is a frightening sight. There is no protection from the fury of a stronger- than - child parent whose temper has passed beyond the realm of reason. Just once I witnessed such a scene in my office when a furious father got up from his seat in front of me and slapped his daughter so hard she literally reeled against his onslaught. 
She screamed in fright and her subsequent embarrassment was heart-rending. I wish Principals could expel fathers. Certainly we wish we could control them. I will not even touch upon the psychological implication of that incident or of others like it. It can be horrendous. 
Has Corporal Punishment ever been known to have enhanced performances in Studies, Sports or the Arts It has not. It has had the very opposite effect with a tremendous psychological backlash as well 

I believe a Child Protection Society functions in the island but what child is going to report a parent For two years or more I listened to the screams of fear that emanated every weekday morning from a house behind mine where twin girls were being looked after by their grandmother while both parents worked. There was not a thing I could do about it. All complaints had to be made in writing to the Police or the Child Protection Society and why would I put myself in line of fire of an angry grandmother who could, and would, rightly tell me it was none of my business 
Abuse of minors takes place all over the world but none so common as abuse in schools. I totally agree with writer, Uditha Davapriya, that we have an educational system that expects deference from students for teachers who do not deserve it. The old Shishya/Guru is totally outdated and I am glad to say we have a less inhibited group of children in International Schools at least. They speak out often and teachers listen. A perfect method and balance in punishment technique has yet to be found but at least many educationists are trying. 
I have another question. Who is going to handle bullying parents

President urges world to support SL's reconciliation
	
President Maithripala Sirisena called upon the international community to seriously consider the tremendous progress made by the government towards reconciliation, restoration of democratic freedoms, human rights and the rule of law and extend the fullest support to the slow, but the steady forward march of Sri Lanka to build a progressive, democratic, free and equal society with high morals and discipline. 
Addressing the 72nd Session of the United nations General Assembly in New York on September 19 (20th morning in SL time), he pointed out that we all are aware that haste will not yield good results and the slow and steady path is the most suitable one to restore religious and communal harmony so that people of all communities could live in peace and harmony as equal citizens.
He said that during the last two and a half years, the government has taken several important steps that are necessary for consolidating democracy, freedom, good governance, and the rule of law. Through such transformative steps, we have laid the foundation necessary to forge national reconciliation, and ensure non-recurrence of conflict in our country, he said.
As a country that has suffered violent conflict for 30 years, we are drawing from experience and lessons learned to strengthen national reconciliation, and we are determined to prevent the recurrence of conflict. We have given priority in this context to consolidate freedom and democracy in our country, and through a strong foundation of national reconciliation forged through unity and friendship among communities, the President said.
President Sirisena stressed that the vision of the government is to ensure sustained economic development through the increase of domestic agriculture and industry under an environment friendly policies and programs. He emphasized the imperative need to adhere to the Paris Protocol on Climate Change for the sake of the future of the human beings as well as flora and fauna.
Pointing out that poverty is presented a serious challenge throughout the world, he said that year 2017 has been declared as the year of freedom from poverty in Sri Lanka and have prioritized economic development. We have initiated a Grama Shakthi programme to empower villages and to give prominence to putting in place the necessary requirements for addressing all the problems faced by the people of the country.
President Sirisena called on the world leaders to take a collective action for eradication of narcotic drugs. He said he wanted to draw the attention of the respected General Assembly of the United Nations to the problem of drugs that poses a serious threat to human society itself, preying on young children and causing much destruction to communities. Such a programme must include plans and efforts to combat this menace at national level in all countries, and at international level, he said.
The President explained the successful efforts made by the government with regard to lessen the foreign debt burden and usher in economic revival and sought the support of the world community to the efforts made by Sri Lanka for economic development.
Pointing out that Sri Lanka as a member of the UN for the last 62 years adhered to the UN conventions, policies and principles, he said that the nation requires the patient, understanding and support for its slow, but steady march to create a peaceful and prosperous country for its people.

SL fugitive faces Sh 253.3 Million theft charge in Kenya
	
Moshin Ranatunga, who entered Kenya on a 90-day visa, was charged last year with stealing Sh 253.3 Million (USD 2,450,377) from his employer, Ranfer Teas Kenya, between July 2012 and September 2015.
Assistant Deputy Public Prosecutor Alexander Muteti applied to have Ranatunga's Sh1 million bond cancelled, arguing that he was a flight risk.
Muteti told the court that Mr Ranatunga had run away from the country in 2016 after a warrant of arrest was issued against him in connection with the lost money.
He told Senior Resident Magistrate Henry Nyakweba that the accused was living illegally in Kenya and should not be released until his passport is regularised.
"He is a man of no status at this point and cannot be released without assurance that he will come back. Until further sureties, he has to be in custody," said Muteti.
He said Ranatunga was also on the run from the Sri Lankan government.
"The Sir-Lankan authorities were shocked that he was actually in Kenya. His house of cards crumbled with the letter from the Sri Lanka government seeking information about him," said Muteti.
It is not clear what offences Ranatungae is facing back home as there are pending proceedings. Mr Nyakweba said he would make a ruling on Ranatunga's release on bond once he determines the authenticity of his passport. (Standard Media)

Sri Lanka have qualified for the ICC Cricket World Cup 2019 after the Windies lost the first ODI against England at Old Trafford on Tuesday.
With 30 September 2017 set as the cut-off date for automatic qualification for the ICCs pinnacle 50-over tournament, the Windies (78 points) now cannot move ahead of Sri Lanka (86 points) on the MRF Tyres ICC ODI Team Rankings irrespective of how their remaining matches against England pan out.

A relieved Sri Lankas ODI captain Upul Tharanga said: Its no secret that we (Sri Lanka) have been going through a tough time, but I want to say a big, big thank you to our fans whove kept faith with us when things looked bleak.
ICC events have always brought out the magic in Sri Lanka cricket, and I look forward to proving that once again.
We have a clear plan toward the World Cup, and we will work hard at achieving each step. As we say in the dressing room, - Little 'w's (wins) add up to make the big 'W' (win) - so that's what we'll be focusing on and I know you will see Sri Lankas special brand of cricket out there once again soon.
The Windies will now progress to the 10-team ICC Cricket World Cup Qualifier 2018, where they will be joined by the bottom three sides on the MRF Tyres ICC ODI Team Rankings - Afghanistan, Zimbabwe and Ireland  as well as the top four sides from the ICC World Cricket League Championship and the top two sides from the ICC World Cricket League Division 2.

Two of the three senior purohitas in this group  one from the gem city area and the other  a loving one  from the Colombo district have put their foot down that they cannot remain with a sense of self-respect in yahapalanaya after this month. However, the senior one from Wayamba who once held secretarial status in the Blue party has now come round to the view that they should give up the idea of quitting yahapalanaya and resume efforts to unite the two factions. Meanwhile, the majority of other dissidents  purohitas of lesser ranks and backbenchers- hold fast to the view that they should quit.
By the way, the radical faction within the dissident group has decided to cross over to the opposition after September 20 come hell or high water, they say.

That the official leader of the opposition decided to move into his Colombo 7 official residence on the advice of Number One in yahapalanaya is no longer news.

When the grey-haired veteran was about to go into occupation of the official residence, he had received astrological advice not to move into the new residence before getting clearance from the competent astrologers that the premises was free from Vastu Dosha. Now the astrologers are being consulted on the rituals to be performed to propitiate deities and to nullify the possible Vastu Dosha. So the veteran political leader is waiting for the okay from astrologers to move into his official residence, they say.

Taking a closer  look at ETCA
	
(The writer is the secretary of the Association of Information Technology Professionals and a coauthor of the book ETCA  Neyekda Akramanikayekda) 
When Sri Lanka and India decided to start working on a comprehensive economic agreement between the two countries, Chandrika Kumaratunga was the President and Ranil Wickremesinghe was the then Prime Minister of Sri Lanka. In April 2003, the Joint Study Group was established to commence work on the agreement which was named CEPA (Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement) at that time. 
It progressed irrespective of the change of Government in 2005. Everything was organized to sign the framework agreement for CEPA during the 15th SAARC Summit in Colombo in 2008. Despite the preparations, the then President Mahinda Rajapakse lent an ear to local entrepreneurs, some of the political parties in the coalition Government and nationalistic movements and decided not to sign the agreement. After that, progress of the comprehensive economic partnership agreement with India decelerated. However, a few Sri Lankan economists who worked according to the agenda of India strove to bring back the agreement to the surface. 
ETCA at the end of 2017
Once the current Government was elected, progress towards a comprehensive economic agreement with India was again accelerated. Objections from the civil society, particularly from the professionals amplified. The name of the agreement was thus changed from CEPA to ETCA (Economic and Technical Cooperation Agreement).  The entire negotiation process of the agreement has been conducted without transparency and stake holder participation which are considered as key features for successfully negotiating a free trade agreement. At one instance it was even declared that even if there was opposition, the Government was going to signthe ETCA. 
Five rounds of discussions between Sri Lanka and India have been concluded by now. According to the lead negotiator of the Sri Lankan team, most of the contents in the agreement have been concluded and the negotiation process will be concluded soon. This will enable the ETCA to be signed by the end of this year or early next year. 
It isnt only information technology and ship building sectors that are considered for service in the agreement. Opportunities to serve this venture are opened to Indian companies and Indian professionals. Other opportunities for them will be opened in fields like transportation, highways, railways, education, health, power and energy, construction, banking and financeas well. 
Meantime there is an attempt to implement some parts of the ETCA via different specific agreements. The Memorandum of Understanding signed between the two countries during the Prime Ministers visit to India in April this year is a good example. 
A few so called economists who are working to make ETCA a reality havent done a feasibility study for 15 years. What they have been doing for such a long time is trying to justify the ETCA by inconsistent and primitive arguments
Political Decision and the Dictatorial Regime
K .J. Weerasinghe who replaces Dr. Saman Kelegama, after the latters sudden demise, as the Lead Negotiator for Sri Lanka has elaborated an important point during an interview with Daily Mirror published on 10th of August. He has mentioned that It is a decision by both the Governments at high political level that ETCA should be negotiated and completed. Though the fact that ETCA is a political decision taken at high political level isnt a secret to many Sri Lankans, it is the first time that a Government official has made it clear to the media in public and it is important due to various reasons. 
In 2008, President Mahinda Rajapakse made a political decision to refrain from signing the agreement after lending an ear to the people of this country. In 2015, once Maithripala Sirisena was elected as President, the new Government made a political decision to restart the process in keeping with the agreement. It was done in an accelerated manner, disregarding objections by local entrepreneurs, professionals and other bodies. 
It is clearly against the mandate for good governance. At least former President Mahinda Rajapakse listened to the people and had the courage to take the decision not to sign the agreement. However with regard to this regime, it seems nobody has the power to take decisions on behalf of the people and ultimately the voice of the people is not hard. Therefore at the end of the day, people seem to experience more dictatorship under this Government, though the dictator is invisible. A regime becomes dictatorial only by its practice. It is under these circumstances that K. J. Weerasinghes claim that ETCA is a decision by both the Governments at high political level becomes more important. We must be thankful to Weerasinghe forhighlighting this. 
However this statement creates more issues. By claiming that ETCA is a political decision, Weerasinghe reduced the scope of the negotiation teams responsibility. In other words, Weerasinghe means that it isnt a responsibility of the negotiation team to decide whether the agreement is beneficial or harmful. The negotiation team is responsible only for the technical issues within in the agreement and the agreement is a political decision by leaders at a high level in both countries. On the other hand, President Sirisena says they arent going to sign any trade agreement which is detrimental to local entrepreneurs. So ultimately it seems that nobody is responsible for the decision to sign the ETCA. Is an invisible dictator hiding behind this wall of irresponsibility 
No feasibility study
It is customary to do a feasibility study before you arrive at any important decision. There is no difference in that when it comes to trade agreements. The Asian Development Banks publication, How to Design, Negotiate and Implement a Free Trade Agreement in Asia suggests At the pre-negotiation consultation stage, national feasibility studies, domestic sensitivity analysis, scoping studies or public hearings to assess the desirability and viability of the proposed FTA and identify sectoral difficulties. A country should recognise the industries which are benefited and threatened by these free trade agreements in the pre-negotiation stage. Not only did Sri Lanka not carry out any of these analyses, but its authorities also didnt even have a pre-negotiation stage. 
A few so called economists who are working to make ETCA a reality havent done a feasibility study for 15 years. What they have been doing for such a long time is trying to justify the ETCA by inconsistent and primitive arguments. We have answered all of those arguments and thoroughly explained why ETCA is detrimental to the Sri Lankan economy and society through the book ETCA  Neyekda Akramanikayekda (ETCA-A relative or an Invader). 
Five rounds of discussions between Sri Lanka and India have been concluded by now. According to the lead negotiator of the Sri Lankan team, most of the contents in the agreement have been concluded and the negotiation process will be concluded soon.

Inconsistencies regarding Mode 4
There have been many inconsistent statements made by those who are in favour of ETCA in this regard. One such false argument has been revealed by the above mentioned interview with K. J. Weerasinghe. Once, MP Dr. Harsha De Silva strongly said that mode 4  movement of natural persons wouldnt be included in the agreement. Weerasinghe explains that three subcategories out of four subcategories under mode 4 namely, corporate transferees, contractual suppliers, and business visitors have been included in ETCA. The only subcategory which hasnt been included for the time being is independent professionals. However during her visit to Sri Lanka in Septemeber, 2016, Indias former Commerce and Industry Minister Dr. Nirmala Sitharaman explained that mode 4 will be implemented step by step. Since the subcategory which isnt included now in the agreement is independent professionals only, that could be expected to be included at the next stage. 
Though Weerasinghe mentioned that ETCA is a decision taken by both the Governments at a high political level, if one analyses the costs and benefits then it isnt that difficult to realize that ETCA is a decision by one country and the other is just obeying.

World Federation of Exchanges CEO visits CSE
	
Making her first visit to the Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE), World Federation of Exchanges (WFE) Chief Executive Officer Nandini Sukumar commended the special relationship between the two organisations and stressed on the important contribution made by the CSE to regional capital market development.
Her visit aims to further strengthen the relationship between the CSE and WFE and will also offer the federations insight on strategic initiatives pursued by the CSE.
Speaking at a Market Opening Ceremony organised to honour her visit, she said, I see the CSE and its engagement with the WFE as a metaphor for the success of the WFE. When I see the exchange participating with the WFE more and more, I feel that we are doing the right things and that we are on the right track when serving our members. Youve been part of our history and you are part of our future.
She added that the CSE has been an incredibly dynamic exchange and supportive of other exchanges in the region.
Commenting on the role of exchanges in emerging economies, she went on to state, In countries such as Sri Lanka, exchanges are particularly important. An exchange at the heart of the market, like it is here, has a far wider, more systemic and more profound role that visibly translates into growth and development. We see first-hand what a difference we can make in daily life and through our working lives.
CSE Chairman Ray Abeywardena speaking at the event welcomed Sukumar to the CSE and thanked the WFE for opportunities and assistance provided to the CSE over the years.
He also congratulated Sukumar on a successful WFE General Assembly and Annual Meeting hosted in Bangkok, Thailand earlier this month. He noted that the WFE has been instrumental in offering the CSE a pathway to engage, collaborate and learn from other markets and more developed peers.
Established in 1961 and headquartered in London, the WFE is the global industry association for exchanges and clearing houses and represents over 200 market infrastructure providers. The CSE obtained the WFE membership in 1998 and was its first South Asian member.
The WFE exchanges are home to nearly 45,000 listed companies and the market capitalisation of these entities is over US $ 67.9 trillion. Furthermore, around US $ 84.18 trillion (EOB) in trading annually passes through the infrastructures the WFE members safeguard (at end-2016).
The WFE is the definitive source for exchange-traded statistics and publishes over 350 market data indicators. Its statistics database stretches back more than 40 years and provides information and insight into developments on global exchanges. As an industry trade organisation, the WFE has discussed virtually every aspect of the capital market: technical, commercial, legal and economic.

16-yr-old German girl who joined ISIS may face death penalty
	
Iraq, (Daily Mail), 18 September 2017 - - A German teenager who ran away to join ISIS may yet face the death penalty, Iraqs Prime Minister has warned. 

Linda Wenzel was dragged from the rubble in Mosul as Iraqi forces liberated the city in July and is now being held in Baghdad where her fate rests in the hands of the countrys court system. 
The 16-year-old, who left her home in Pulsnitz, eastern Germany, last year to join the terror group, is desperate to return to Europe amid fears she could spend years in jail. 
But Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi has now said Iraqs judiciary will decide if the teenager will face the death penalty.
