Art can take you anywhere: Kochi-Muziris Biennale ?16
	
The common saying ?Art can take you anywhere? is vividly proved if you happened to visit South Asia?s largest contemporary art exhibition ?Kochi-Muziris Biennale (KMB) 2016? in Fort Kochi, Kerala.?
Arts performances and productions by ninety-seven artistes representing 31 countries including Sri Lanka are featured at the KMB. Titled ?Forming in the pupil of an eye,? much-awaited creative extravaganza?s curtains went up on December 12 last year, and will be closed on March 29, 2017.?
The KMB holds a mirror up to the general public, reflecting its interests and concerns while at the same time challenging its social misconceptions and political issues such as global refugee crises. It also explores concepts of historical identity and cultural memory through various forms of media such as painting, sculpture, drawing, installation, film and video, photography, activism, street performances and music.?
In one stall, visitors get the tactile experience of having to wade through ankle-deep sea water, recalling the terrible experience encountered by the two Syrian kids Alan Kurdi and Galip Kurdi who drowned in the Mediterranean waters in 2015 while making an escape to Turkey. In another stall, you are taken to an Indian colourful folk art performance called ?Payyunur Charadukuthi Kolkali? (traditional form, native to Payyanur in Kannur District).?
Curated by Indian artist Sudarshan Shetty, the KMB?s organisers have successfully attempted to bring various cultures from different countries into the world of art. Below are some must-see art installations which lingered in mind.?
?
?Sea of pain? - Chillie (Pic)?
Chilliean artist Ra?l Zurita wades barefoot through the knee-deep stretch of seawater that covers his installation ?Sea ?of Pain,? bearing in mind the agony the innocent Syrian boys Alan Kurdi and Galip Kurdi underwent while crossing the border in the Mediterranean Sea in 2015.?
?
Histories of Resistance - Sri Lanka ?
Sri Lankan artist T. Shanaathanan?s exhibit presents forgotten, personal takes on Sri Lanka?s civil war.?
Speaking on his Cabinet containing stories on display at KMB, he said he attempted to talk about unheard personal stories of the hardships faced by civilians and how they were handled from a civilian?s point of view.?
Since 2004, Shanaathanan has toiled to collect firsthand experiences of individual tragedies in the hope of coming into terms with his own trauma.?
?Today, the 400-km journey from Jaffna to Colombo takes hardly six hours by bus. During the war, since most of the routes were blocked or barred, one had to go through no man?s zones.?
There was no certainty about whether you would reach.?
It is not just physical pain, but also the hardships the common man has to face daily in war-torn areas that causes mental trauma. I found that my experiences were not unique. They were shared by people,? he said.?
?
?
Unspoken conversation?- Norway?
Norwegian artist Camille Norment?s sound art installation engages visitors in an unspoken conversation with their slow murmuring, chanting, humming and moaning. Wooden benches where exciters are attached with provide seemingly thoughtful accommodation while listening to the deep and resonant voices.?
Elegant vandalism?- UK
British artist Jonathan Owen?s art - an anonymous woman sitting perched on a pedestal to be gawked at. For Owen, his sculpture, part of an ongoing series of work called ?Untitled,? is a look at how women are made prisoners of the beauty myth.?
?
?
Contemporary narrative ?-China
A painting by Chinese artist Dai Xiang shows a contemporary transformation through photographs. The 25m panoramic photo installation also sketches the current realities in China through a dramatic approach and points a finger at issues affecting China.?
?
?Payyunur Charadukuthi Kolkali? ? India
A centuries-old Kerala folk art named ?Payyunur Charadukuthi Kolkali? was performed at the KMB premises by a group of Indian dancers.?
?
?Secret Dialogues? - India
Indian artist C. Bhagyanath?s ?Secret Dialogues? is a story about layers making the transparent apparent. The artwork explores the human act of adding to what comes before to express the relationship between the mind and the body, the human and the animal, the inside and the outside. ??

Australia offers practical aid for reconciliation measures in SL
	
Australia has assured that it would continue to stand with Sri Lanka on the journey to achieve reconciliation and lend practical support for reconciliation measures.
In a joint statement issued by two governments at the end of the visit of Sri Lankan Premier Ranil Wickremesinghe to Australia, Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull commended Sri Lanka on its strong economic growth and considerable progress toward national reconciliation since the end of the conflict in 2009.
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe paid an official visit to Australia from February 13 -17 at the invitation of Prime Minister Turnbull.
The two Prime Ministers underlined the importance of continuing to counter the illegal people smuggling trade, which puts vulnerable peoples' lives at risk and enriches criminal networks.
They emphasised their commitment to detect and deter people smuggling ventures and to strengthen the close working relationship between agencies. ?
Prime Ministers reiterated the shared interest in regional stability.
?As Indo-Pacific neighbours, Indian Ocean Rim Association (IORA) members and trading nations, both countries benefited from a peaceful and secure maritime domain,? the statement said.
The two Prime Ministers launched the tour of Australia by the Sri Lankan cricket team and noted the role of sporting exchanges in the bilateral relationship.
They also welcomed the signing of a MoU on Cooperation in Sport to deepen cooperation between professionals in cricket, basketball, swimming, volleyball, tennis, boxing, rugby, cycling, golf and baseball, as well as in sports integrity measures.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe thanked Prime Minister Turnbull for the warm hospitality extended and invited him to visit Sri Lanka at a mutually convenient time.

CMC launches Smart Park Mobile App in Colombo
	
The Colombo Municipal Council (CMC) yesterday launched a Smart Park Mobile App to enhance the services offered to motorists in the city.
CMC Commissioner V. K. A. Anura said the Smart Park Mobile App is an enhancement to services provided by Tenaka Parkings in improving customer satisfaction by providing an efficient parking management service in a professional and orderly manner to ensure a safe, secure and friendly environment.
The project includes installation of parking meters along the length of the Galle Road, R. A. de Mel Mawatha and all by-roads connecting these roads with the parking management operator being Tenaga Car Parks (Pvt.) Ltd. ?We have now completed the installation of parking meters on the first phase and they are now operational. This will benefit the public and business community as the availability of vacant parking slots will increase with this new system,? he said.
The new technology implemented would enable motor vehicle user to pay using a touch card introduced by Dialog Axiata Sri Lanka or by cash, for their convenience. Further payment option will be extended through a mobile application as well in the near future.
We encourage the public to use the touch card system as a payment option for the parking meters as the machine will not refund or give back change if the cash deposit is selected as the payment option. Therefore the public is advised to deposit the exact value in notes when the settlement is made using cash.
The Dialog Touch Cards are readily available at Dialog merchant outlets in this zone as well as through with employees of Tenaga Car Parks (Pvt) Ltd who have been posted next to these parking meters at the initial stage for the convenience of motorists.
The guest invitees for the launch were-From left Head of Business Development Dialog Digital Shankar Dharmaratne,Tenaga Car Parks (pvt) Ltd Managing Director Duminda Jayatilake,Tenaga Car Parks (pvt) Ltd CEO Dilan Perera, Tenaga Car Parks (pvt) Ltd Director A.F.

EU Parliament backs landmark Canada trade deal
	
AFP, 15th FEBRUARY, 2017- The European Parliament backed a contested EU-Canada free trade deal on Wednesday, facing down protests by activists and Donald Trump-inspired calls for protectionism.
MEPs hailed the deal as a rare victory for an imperilled global trade system that is under threat from US President Trump who opposes far-reaching trade deals.
The accord, known as CETA, is tipped as Europe?s most modern ever and a possible model for relations with Britain after its leaves the EU.
MEPs meeting in Strasbourg, France, solidly approved the pact with 408 votes in favour, 254 against and 33 abstentions. ??This is a watershed moment - EU trade policy will never be the same again,? said senior Scottish MEP David Martin, whose Socialists and Democrats group split on the issue.
Approval by the parliament allows the provisional implementation of the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement as early as next month.
Protesters attempted to disrupt the vote, with about 700 people marching outside parliament to voice their opposition to the deal.

Fitch revises outlook to Stable on three Lankan financial institutions
	
Fitch Ratings has revised the outlook on Bank of Ceylon (BOC, B+/Stable), National Savings Bank (NSB, B+/Stable) and People?s Leasing & Finance PLC (PLC, B/Stable) to Stable from Negative and affirmed their Long-Term Issuer Default Ratings (IDR).
The rating action follows the 9 February 2017 Outlook revision on Sri Lanka?s sovereign rating (B+/Stable) to Stable from Negative.?
The IDRs, Support Rating and Support Rating Floors of BOC and NSB reflect Fitch?s expectation of extraordinary support from the sovereign. Their ratings are equalized with the sovereign. Fitch sees state support for BOC stemming from its high systemic importance and quasi-sovereign status while state support for NSB stems from its policy mandate. PLC?s ratings differ by one notch from those of the sovereign, as we expect sovereign support to flow through its parent, the state-owned and systemically important People?s Bank (Sri Lanka) (AA+(lka)/Stable). The Stable Outlook on the IDRs of BOC, NSB and PLC reflect the Stable Outlook on the sovereign?s rating.
Changes to the sovereign rating or perception of state support to BOC and NSB could result in a change in the lenders? ratings. PLC?s ratings are also sensitive to changes in the sovereign rating, as this would affect People?s Bank?s ability to provide support to its subsidiary. PLC?s ratings are also sensitive to People?s Bank?s propensity to provide support.

GMOA warns of TU action over SAITM
	
The Government Medical Officers? Association (GMOA) today threatened to resort to major country-wide Trade Union (TU) action next week if the government failed to resolve the issues regarding South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM).
GMOA Secretary Dr. Naween De Soysa told a media briefing that the Health and Higher Education Ministers? actions had forced them to take the decision.
However, he said the discussions they had with the relevant authorities did not yield a positive outcome.
?Health Minister Rajitha Senarathne and Higher Education Minister Lakshman Kiriella have failed to perform their duties and thus compelled us to resort to TU action,? he said.
Dr. Soysa said that they expected a wise figure after S B Dissanayake to chair the Higher Education Ministry and alleged that the government appointed Minister Lakshman Kiriella who behaved like a clown.
?Both the present and the former Ministers in Health and Higher Education who were involved in establishing the SAITM had neglected their official duty," he alleged.
He further said the association had to take stern action as it is a timely need to secure the patients? lives which have been risked by the Ministry's? irresponsible behavior.
Meanwhile, Dr. Soysa said proposed TU action would not affect the hospital emergency services and doctors would attend to surgeries on critical patients. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

H?tota port sale: China is flexible, says envoy
	
? Says it?s up to govt. to decide the stake to be given to Chinese
? But says controlling stake should be with Chinese for operational efficiency
? Asserts port without industrial zone makes little sense
? Agreement signing will only be after FR case is resolved
China is flexible on the conditions of the drafted Hambantota port agreement, Chinese Ambassador to Sri Lanka Yi Xianliang said yesterday amid the contradicting statements made by powerful cabinet ministers during the past several months.
?We are flexible. This is a decision by the (Sri Lankan) government. We never requested a definite how much portion or percentage of shares. This is totally decided by the government. China is flexible, whether it is 80 percent or 60 percent,? he said.
Xianliang was making these comments after delivering the Sujata Jayawardena Memorial Lecture organised by the University of Colombo Alumni Association at the BMICH last night, where he deviated wildly from a prepared lecture to deliver a politically-charged speech.
He said that a Chinese company, whether it is China Port Merchant Holdings (CMPH) or China Harbour Engineering Company (CHEC), should own at least 51 percent of the port for operational control and efficiency.
Both the entities are controlled by the Chinese state, which was the reason given by Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake for not opting for an international tender in finding a party to run the Hambantota port, since government-to-government relations were preferable.
Development Strategies and International Trade Minister Malik Samarawickrama recently claimed that CMPH offered to buy 80 percent of the shares of the port for US $ 1.12 billion for 99 years, which was the best deal for Sri Lanka, compared to the CHEC deal of 65 percent of shares for 50 years for US $ 750 million.
Samarawickrama remained adamant that the current government would only go ahead with the CMPH deal, following the claims by the former President Mahinda Rajapaksa that CHEC offered a better deal, which was profitable to Sri Lanka?the deal he would have followed had he remained in power.
Xianliang further contradicted Samarawickrama?s claims that China would go ahead with the port investment, even if it doesn?t get the industrial zone.
?I don?t believe these are two issues. If no zone, the port might be a little bit difficult,? Xianliang said, after stating that it was he who suggested to both the Sri Lankan and Chinese governments to set up a special industrial zone.
The industrial zone and port together would draw up to US $ 10 billion in investments over five years, which Sri Lanka is sorely in need of, to rectify the balance of payment issues.
China is banking on the Hambantota port on its ?One Belt, One Road? initiative, which aims to revive the ancient land and maritime silk route, in order to ensure China?s energy security.
However, Xianliang said the port would not be profitable without an industrial zone.
However, he said that disagreements between individuals shouldn?t bloat into bilateral issues.
?Of course, I have differences with some ministers but these are not differences between two states. Both these projects will be important for Sri Lanka in the future. So we go ahead or we stop here,? he added.
He also said that the agreement, which is already drafted, would not be signed until the fundamental rights (FR) case filed at the Supreme Court claiming that the port sale is illegal, is resolved.
A fortnight ago, Karunanayake said that Sri Lanka and China are hoping to ?finish off? the Hambantota port deal within the very week. Samarawickrama last December said the agreement would be signed by early January.
Xianliang said that China would not have tolerated the levels of opposition it is facing from Sri Lanka from any other country, which shows the friendship between the two nations.
?I remember the president (Xi Jingping) telling me ?I have patience but I?m worried about our business people?,? Xianliang said.
He said that many of the investors who are hoping to relocate businesses to Hambantota and who are interested in setting up operations in the Colombo Port City are Fortune 500 companies and their CEOs prefer to invest in other countries, given the delays experienced with entering Sri Lanka.
Xianliang also reassured the residents of Hambantota by promising that China would neither go ahead with the acquisition of residential land without permission, nor acquire arable land.
He further added that he would like the support of Sri Lankan academia and students, likely referring to the active lobbying power of these circles.
He said that the relations between the two countries should depend on the people and not on ideologies or economics. (Chandeepa Wettasinghe)

## Title: Hey, stop setting fire to our forests

Hey, stop setting fire to our forests
	
?
The country once called paradise is now better known for the destruction of its land, people and its natural resources. We faced an extreme drought in the recent past. The destruction of forests in the hill region is one of the direct causes for the natural disasters including landslides which have occurred. People tend to think that voicing concern for the forests and protecting them is a duty of environmentalists, and theirs only; this thinking has come due to widespread ignorance on the basic background of one?s environment.?
? Fires in forests are the most important phases in the forest life cycle and those are not at all bad. By burning the forest under bush, dead trees and dried plant matter become nourishing fertilizer and animals could have greater food sources as a result. Natural forest fires are alien to Sri Lankan forests because we don?t have dry thunderstorms or volcanic eruptions that lead to natural forest fires. Yet in the dry seasons, forests become fire friendly. Usually in February and March, forest fires occur due to the carelessness of people. ?
?
?
?Controlling fires should be coordinated between relevant institutions??
- Pradeep kodippili - Spokesperson of Disaster Management Centre
?Every year fires are recorded in Sri Lanka. Many fires are caused by people, not due to natural causes. Once a fire starts, limiting, stopping or reducing the damage is costly. It takes more than Rs. 200,000 to use a helicopter and fire brigade in fire control situations. We make the public aware all the time about fires and fire precautions. Animals and plants are critically damaged by fires. There are more than 300 fires on average. Spreading of fires do the most damage to forests. In an emergency fire situation, police, forces and the fire brigade take actions as soon as possible.
According to my opinion, there should be a coordinated common goal between the relevant institutions in controlling fires, every stake holder should join together to stop forest fires in Sri Lanka.? ?
According to a leading environmentalist in the country, frequent fires are taking place because of a grass species called ?Gini grass? (Panicum maximum)in central highlands. ??
We heard that this specific grass was introduced to Sri Lanka?s highlands by a certain politician who claimed that those grass species help to have an increased milk production from cattle. According to a report compiled by a responsible authority in 2003, 55% of up country fires were reported in pine plantations and 20% were in Eucalyptus plantations, proving that plantations and grasslands are the areas with the highest number of reported fires. Most of the fires have begun in small sized plantations. ?
?
Losing a treasure
Though a small country, Sri Lanka is blessed with abundant natural resources. The four principal rivers starting from the ?Samanala Kanda? or Adams? Peak in the central highlands flow to all four sides.?
The forests in the central highlands area are the heart of the ecosystems in the country, consisting of an incredible biodiversity. Deforestation and man made fires are the main causes for the loss of our forests in this vital zone. The deforestation in this area badly affects the water supply. ?Pine and Eucalyptus trees were planted in the hills in the 20th century. These and other foreign invasive species rooted in the area can spread fires fast and absorb nutrition in the soil, thereby making the lands barren. By cutting down trees in hilly areas, the soil and nutrition too, get washed down, hindering the growth of more desirable trees.
?
?All fires are man - made??
- A Reliable source from?
the Department of Wildlife Conservation?
who prefers to remain incognito ??
?
?Sri Lanka doesn?t have any natural fires in the forests and all fires are started by people. For example, fires are started by poachers, to have new grass for cattle and even for pleasure. Victoria, Randenigala and Rantembe sanctuary, Thangamale sanctuary and Ravana Ella sanctuary have frequent fires. In an emergency forest fire, we take immediate action in coordination with DMC and other government offices. And we maintain fire belts in forests to control the spread. In the peak of the dry season, we set fire to sanctuaries like Vilpattu and Udawalawa, to reduce possible damage from large fires. By doing this, the dry undergrowth of the forest gets burned and when big fires come, these areas help to control the fire. The process is called ?cool burning? and it is a process done only with experts. In habitat management the animals threatened by fires are evacuated, get treated by veterinarians if necessary and released into the forest.? ??
This is a message for all Sri Lankans: please be aware that forests are not pleasure parks to start fireworks. If we keep destroying this valuable resource given to us by nature, more disasters such as droughts, floods and landslides will occur, the forests will be depleted and the whole country and everyone will have to suffer for the sins of a few. ??
?
?Forests set on fire to obtain sand in Badulla?
?- W.A.C Weragoda - Conservator of forests ? The Forest Department
?There are no natural forest fires in Sri Lanka. All the fires that have been reported are man-made. Chena cultivation, fires in gardens close to forests, campires, lighting fires to scare away animals for hunting purposes are some of the reasons behind this. Even cattle owners set fire to forests on purpose to have fresh grass for cattle. Another reason for forest fires has now been detected - the beedi industry. Farmers tend to set fire to forests to have a bigger harvest because the Diaspyros bellirica called as Kadumberiya leaves broaden when heated. There have been numerous fires reported Nilgala forest. Another recent damage was reported from the Badulla district, forests are fired to acquire accumulated sand, when the sand in hilly areas gets washed by rain. Some train passengers throw cigarette butts to forests and this too, is causing forest fires. ??
?Badulla, Nuwara Eliya, Moneragala, Polonnaruwa and Ratnapura districts have the highest recorded number of forest fires. 2500 hectares of land were destroyed by fire last year. Nearly all the districts have recorded such fires and the under-growth in forests is affected as a result.? ??
?Fires spread easily in dry weather and the probability depends on the severity of the drought. Fires were expected in January but it is believed that the frequency of fires will be reduced due to sudden rainfall. Due to forest fires, biodiversity in the forest is badly affected, forest wildlife is affected, and forest degradation and deforestation worsens.? he explained. ??
?To protect forests, awareness programmes for villagers and relevant government officials are going on. We have started community forest management societies. We could reduce the damage caused by fires last year with immediate action taken by village communities and put out the fires before they spread. Fire lines separating forests are one safety method used to control the spreading of fires. Fire fighting equipment such as water bowser and tractors are being distributed at district level. Support of the police, the armed forces and the Civil Protection Department is important to control fires immediately. ?
There are three main types of forests in Sri Lanka and the punishments for starting fires in them are as follows: ??
Conservation forest -?
fine for starting fire - up to seven years imprisonment or Rs. 20,000--200,000 fine - according to the value of the forest. ??
Forest Reserves - fine for starting fire - up to five years imprisonment or Rs. 10.000--100,000 fine - and value of the damage. ??
Other forests - up to two years? imprisonment or?
Rs. 5000-- 50,000 or both. ??

India seeks cap on wedding guests
	
A Bill in Indian Parliament seeks to put a limit on the number of guests to be invited and dishes to be served in weddings to check show of wealth and wants those spending above Rs. 500,000 (INR) to contribute towards marriages of poor girls, the Hindustan Times reported today.
If a family spends above Rs. 500,000 on a wedding, it has to contribute 10% of the amount on marriages of girls from poor families, according to the Bill introduced by MP Ranjeet Ranjan, wife of MP Pappu Yadav.
The Marriages (Compulsory Registration and Prevention of Wasteful Expenditure) Bill, 2016, may be taken up as a private member?s bill in the upcoming Lok Sabha session.
The purpose of this bill is to prohibit extravagant and wasteful expenditure on marriages and to enforce simpler solemnisation, Ranjeet told PTI.
?Great importance should be assigned to the solemnisation of marriage between two individuals. But unfortunately, a tendency of celebrating marriages with pomp and show and spending lavishly growing in the country these days,?
??These days, marriages are more about showing off your wealth and as a result, poor families are under tremendous social pressure to spend more. This is needed to be checked as it is not good for society at large,? she said.
The bill seeks that ?if any family intends to spend more than Rs.500,000 towards expenditure on marriage, such family shall declare the amount proposed to be spent in advance to the appropriate government and contribute 10% of such amount in a welfare fund which shall be established by the appropriate government to assist the poor and below poverty line families for the marriage of their daughters?.
It says that after this proposed legislation comes into force, all marriages shall be registered within 60 days of the solemnisation.
The government may fix the limit of guests and relatives and number of dishes to be served to the guests and relatives for solemnisation of marriage or for the reception held thereafter as it may deem necessary or expedient to prevent the wastage of food items, it adds.

The Inter University Students' Federation (IUSF), at a meeting with President Maithripala Sirisena today said the President had so far failed to take a firm stance on the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM) issue.
IUSF Convener Lahiru Weerasekara said President Sirisena had informed them that he was yet to discuss the issue with the representatives of SAITM. The President earlier promised us that a decision would be taken soon with regards to the SAITM issue, but today he admitted that he was yet to discuss the matter with the relevant authorities,? he said.
He said they had informed the President that students belonging to eight medical faculties continue to refrain from taking part in lectures until a proper solution was given to them with regards to the SAITM issue.
Meanwhile, President Sirisena has advised students of university student federations to attend lectures.
The President had promised to make a decision on SAITM after holding talks with other student federations, the deans of the eight medical faculties, Sri Lanka Medical Council(SLMC), University Grants Commission (UGC) and the SAITM administration.
The discussion was held yesterday at the Presidential Secretariat with the participation of IUSF representatives, members of Medical Faculty Student Activists Committee and the Inter University Bhikku Federation (IUBF). (Yoshitha Perera)

?
LankaClear achieved another gigantic milestone bybecoming the first entity in Sri Lanka to obtainthe certification of Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS),version 3.2.?
The trust that they have built over the years was further boosted by this certification, which is at the zenith of international data security standards in the payment card industry.?
PCI DSS standard is very effective in reducing payment card related breaches, as LankaClear understood the intent behind each requirement and implemented it smoothly with the help of a good standing qualified security assessor (PCI-QSA) and the commitment from the LankaClear Board and Senior Corporate Management.
As a safeguard to the payment industry in the face of rising payment card data breaches the world over, the Payment Card Industry Security Standards Council (PCISSC), governing body of PCIDSS, was established in 2006 by the world?s leading international card schemeswhojoined togetherfor this effort. Accordingly, the founding members of PCISSC aligned and improved their internal information security mechanismsto come up with a unified information security programme for the payment card industry, which saw the debut of the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS), along with some of the other supporting standards such as PA-DSS, PCI-PIN, P2PE, etc.
Expressing his view on this remarkable achievement, Anil Amarasuriya, Chairman of LankaClear stated ?With the growing number of security incidents the world over, today,data security is of paramount importance. Although no organization could be immune to the rising tide of data security risks and the fact that vulnerabilities can?t be totally eliminated, obtaining an internationally acclaimed security standard such as PCI-DSS certainly signifies the organization?s commitment towards security, being true to its brand promise of becoming the country?s trusted national payment network. LankaClear is indeed proud to be trailblazing Sri Lanka?s payment industry to come on par with international standards, thereby providing a robust payment infrastructure for the banking and financial sector.Thisis vital for the stability and public confidence placed on the entire banking system.?
??It is indeed a landmark achievement by LankaClear to obtain this world renowned certification, which is a testament to our commitment to maintain international standards for all our services. The rigorous process that the entire organization, people, process and culture, went through to achieve this envious status also encompasses a change in our DNA as to how the organization now views security as a whole. Maintaining such an exhaustive international benchmark is not a one-off activity, but an ongoing process and the organization has now laid an excellent foundation to be vigilant and ready to face any security eventuality,? LankaPay, is steadfast to this cause and would do its utmost to exceed expectations of all our stakeholders?said, Channa de Silva, General Manager/CEO of LankaClear.
SISA Information Security was the PCI Qualified Security Assessor(QSA) responsible for carrying out the stringent pre and post audits to confer the PCI-DSS certification to LankaClear.?
SISA Worldwide CEO and Founder, Dharshan Shanthamurthy expressing his views said, ?Maintaining the safety of card data and banking systems should be one of the top priorities in card acquiring and issuing companies. We are glad to know LankaClear holds the same belief and is working hard towards it.??
Dileepa Lathsara, CEO of TechCERT while applauding LankaClear stated, ?We at TechCERT congratulate LankaClear on successfully achieving PCI-DSS V3.2 certification and becoming the first Sri Lankan Organisation to achieve this significant milestone. TechCERT, as the lead project consultant and the solution implementation partner, is proud to be part of this tremendous achievement. The effort that the LankaClear team has put in to provide a secure online payment infrastructure should be highly appreciated since they set up the first national level certification authority for Sri Lanka in 2009, in collaboration with TechCERT.?
?PCI DSS certification has the highest security standard for payment card related data. LankaClear being PCI DSS ver. 3.2 certified creates the highest security standards for payment card related data within LankaPay Infrastructure. In addition LankaClear has gone the extra mile in adopting the same standard for bank customer account related data,? said Harsha Wanigatunga, Deputy General Manager ? IT and Operations of LankaClear.

Lasantha?s murder; SC holds Army officer?s rights violated
	
The Supreme Court yesterday held that the fundamental rights of an Army Officer attached to the Intelligence Unit, who had been arrested and detained under the pretension of being a suspect regarding the murder of Journalist Lasantha Wickramathunga, have been infringed and awarded Rs.100,000 as compensation.
The Bench comprised Justices Sisira J. De Abrew, Upaly Abeyrathne and Anil Gooneratne.
Petitioner K. Priyawans, who was the 7th Military Intelligence Unit of the army as a Lance Corporal challenged the legality of his arrest, decisions to detain him and his long and continuing detention.
He cited former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa, DIG C.N. Wakishta of TID, OIC of the Welikada Remand Prisons, former Additional Defence Secretary S. Hettiarachchi, Inspector Bogammuwa of the TID and the Attorney General as Respondents.
J.C. Weliamuna with Pasindu Silva instructed by Gowry Shangary Thavarasha appeared for the Petitioner. Senior State Counsel Nayomi Wickramasekera appeared for the Respondents.
The Compensation is to be paid by Inspector Bogamuwa who arrested him.
Petitioner stated that he was brought to the TID on 27.02.2010 and questioned inter alia as to whether he had any involvement with the murder of Lasantha Wickramathunga and whether he had associated General Sarath Fonseka. Petitioner answered the said questions in the negative.
He stated that he was produced in the Colombo Magistrate?s Court on 26.05.2010 and was discharged from the proceedings on the basis that no further legal action would be pursued against him.
Though he was discharged from the proceedings, he was not released from detention and instead added as a suspect to the proceedings pending the murder of Lasantha Wickramathunga, he alleged.
He lamented that as a result, he had been in detention for more than one-year and claimed that such long and continuing deprivation of his liberty is in violation of his fundamental right to equality and to the freedom from arbitrary arrest and detention. (S.S. Selvanayagam)

Man fleeing from jumbo encounters 'ghost'
	
One fine night a person was returning home alone after attending a funeral home in the village. After hearing the sound of an approaching elephant he started to shimmy up a tree in panic.
While he was climbing up the tree he heard someone calling out to him from the top of the tree saying ?climb slowly? and later felt his hand being grabbed by someone.
He was so terrified by what had occurred that he rapidly descended from the tree screaming.He was so busy trying to get away from what he thought was a 'ghost' he did not hear a friendly voice calling him not to run.
He did not stop running until he reached his home. He only regained his composure after tying a yellow thread a couple of days later with the assistance of an exorcist to ward off the 'ghost' he had encountered on top of the tree.
The person who was on the tree before this individual climbed it was another man from the same village who had also been frightened by the sound of the approaching elephant and had gone up the tree to avoid it.

He said the joint opposition would never associate itself in matters where the state?s unitary nature is threatened and added that they intended to reveal these facts through debates in the House.
?We planned to resign from these Sub Committees after revelation of these facts to the people. Unfortunately, the government cancelled the debates on the matter in an undemocratic,? he said.
He said they would however reveal those facts to the country and stand for the unitary nature of the country and added that the reason behind the joint opposition members to partake in these Sub Committees was to reveal the dark side of the matter.
?I was the Chairperson to the Sub Committee of state funds. There are many other joint opposition members in the remaining 5 Sub Committees. They will also resign from their membership in the coming days,? he said. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)

Perpetual to purchase SriLankan, Mihin Airlines: JO
	
Joint opposition recently claimed that there was a plan to purchase State owned institutions such as SriLankan and Mihin Air by Perpetual Treasuries Pvt. Ltd.
Addressing a press briefing Prof. G L Peiris said that they had reason to believe that the company was attempting to take over several large-scale State institutions.
Prof. Peiris claimed that Perpetual Treasuries, that was currently embroiled in a major controversy surrounding the Central Bank bond issue, was attempting to purchase these State institutions by using another company as a cat?s-paw.
Recently, State Enterprises and Entrepreneurship Deputy Minister Eran Wickramaratne had told the media that three companies, namely Peace Airways, Texas Pacific Group (TPG) and Super Group Partners were those selected from among 10 companies to compete for the right to engage in the process of restructuring the SriLankan and Mihin Lanka.
From the selected companies, the deputy minister had said that the Texas Pacific Group was the most qualified to restructure the two airlines. However, it was reported that the TPG, which is a US based group, was connected to Perpetual Treasuries Pvt. Ltd. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

Police vow stern action against unruly students
	
DIG Priyantha Jayakody today said police would not hesitate to take stern action against students and supporters who violate the law during the upcoming big match season.
While addressing media at the Criminal Record Division (CRD) DIG Jayakody said police did not try to take stern action during previous traffic law violations by students and that they could not allow such incidents to happen continuously.
He said students could conduct their vehicle parades but there should be a limit. If any student group or supporters violate any traffic rule or behave causing inconvenience to the public, the police will not hesitate to take immediate action against them as to protect the law and order in the country.
DIG Jayakody said students in foreign countries used to hold vehicle parades on behalf of their schools. But they never tried to hold their parade causing any damage to public property or inconveniencing the public.
During the clash between two national schools in Colombo on Wednesday they damaged public property.
?Fifteen students were arrested. Ten students were produced before the Maligakanda Magistrate who ordered to produce them again in courts with Rs 100,000 surety bail. The remaining five students were ordered to be produced in the Hulftsdorp court today,? the DIG said. (Chaturanga Pradeep)

?Principals reluctant to act due to human rights concerns?
	
School Principals of leading Colombo schools, several of whom were forced to discipline students who were found to have been part of clashes that occurred on Wednesday (15), said that they had been put in an awkward position as a result of strictures imposed by institutions such as the Human Rights Commission (HRC) with regards to student discipline.
These principals had conveyed this to Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam during an urgent meeting held at the Ministry to discuss the clashes that broke out between two groups of students of Ananda and Nalanda and another incident at D. S. Senanayake College and also to discuss future security measures to be taken during the big match season to prevent such clashes from taking place.
Minister Kariyawasam inquired from the principals as to what action they had taken with regard to the recent clashes. He pointed out that Circular no: 2016/12 includes measures to be followed when safeguarding discipline at schools and it had empowered School Disciplinary Boards to take action against students who breach discipline.
However, principals were of the opinion that it was extremely difficult for them to adhere to this circular due to recommendations of the HRC and other institutions which had put forward procedures to be followed when disciplining students.
The minister instructed relevant authorities and officials to create a strong mechanism to uphold discipline among students.
He instructed officials to immediately recruit teachers who are counsellors and highlighted the importance of upholding discipline in schools.
?Principals and teachers are directly responsible for discipline among students. Parents too should share the responsibility of disciplining their children,? the minister said.
Principals and vice principals of Ananda, Nalanda, D. S. Senanayake, Royal, Thurstan, Isipathana and Mahanama Colleges in Colombo, Prince of Wales College and St. Sebastian's College in Moratuwa, St. Thomas' College-Mt. Lavinia and Sri Dharmaloka Vidyalaya - Kelaniya attended the meeting.

?Google might go for another country as they might think Sri Lankan people are not ready for such a project, because of negative reports that were published,? he added.
At the same time he said Google was also lobbying with ITU to get the spectrum. (Yohan Perera)

Trump to welcome Netanyahu as Palestinians fear US shift
	
REUTERS, 15th FEBRUARY, 2017- President Donald Trump prepared to host Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Wednesday for talks that could shape the contours of future Middle East policy, as Palestinians warned the White House not to abandon their goal of an independent state.
For decades, the idea of creating a Palestine living peacefully alongside Israel has been a bedrock U.S. position, though the last negotiations broke down in 2014. But in a potential shift, a senior White House official said on Tuesday that peace did not necessarily have to entail Palestinian statehood, and Trump would not try to ?dictate? a solution.
As Trump and Netanyahu prepared to meet, a senior Palestinian official disclosed that on Tuesday, CIA director Mike Pompeo held talks with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas in Ramallah, the seat of the Palestinian government in the occupied West Bank.
?(It was) the first official meeting with a high-profile member of the American administration since Trump took office,? said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity and declined to disclose details of the discussion.
Netanyahu committed, with conditions, to the two-state goal in a speech in 2009 and has broadly reiterated the aim since. But he has also spoken of a ?state minus? option, suggesting he could offer the Palestinians deep-seated autonomy and the trappings of statehood without full sovereignty.

El Aissami is the heir apparent to President Nicolas Maduro, and the US accusations against him triggered the latest row between Venezuela?s socialist government and Washington, the ?imperialist? power it loves to hate. ??
??I take this miserable and vile attack as recognition of my status as an anti-imperialist revolutionary,? El Aissami wrote on Twitter. ??
??We must concentrate on the revolutionary government?s priorities: economic recovery and growth and guaranteeing PEACE and social happiness.? The US Treasury Department on Monday accused El Aissami and an ally, businessman Samark Jose Lopez Bello, of being major drug traffickers and froze their US assets. ??
It said El Aissami protected and oversaw large shipments of cocaine from Venezuela to Mexico and the United States while serving as the country?s interior minister and governor of Aragua state.?

White House tries  to insulate Trump  from Russia scandal
	
The White House battled on Tuesday to insulate Donald Trump from a scandal over his top aide?s contacts with Russia, as it emerged that the president was aware of the problem for weeks before acting. ??
With calls for an independent investigation gathering pace, the White House admitted that Trump was told three weeks ago that national security advisor Michael Flynn may have misled colleagues about his Kremlin contacts. ??
The retired three-star general and former head of US defence intelligence initially denied discussing sanctions strategy with Russia?s ambassador Sergey Kislyak before taking office. ??
That may have breached US law on negotiating with foreign powers, and at minimum was a significant break with the norm that incoming administrations accept the US has ?one government at a time.? Flynn was asked to resign on Monday, after what the White House said were weeks of internal investigation that turned up no evidence of wrongdoing but ?eroded? trust. ??
Law enforcement and intelligence agents intercepted calls and obtained phone records showing that members of Trump?s 2016 presidential campaign and other aides had repeated contacts with top Russian intelligence officials in the year that preceded the November 8 presidential election, The New York Times reported. ??
After finding evidence that Russia was seeking to disrupt the election, US intelligence agencies tried to determine whether the Trump campaign was cooperating with Moscow on hacking and other related efforts, according to the Times. ? However, the newspaper said, the current and former US officials it cited have not yet found evidence of such collusion. ??
Paul Manafort, a former Trump advisor who was among those campaign officials picked up on the calls, dismissed the claims as ?absurd? in an interview with the Times.?
