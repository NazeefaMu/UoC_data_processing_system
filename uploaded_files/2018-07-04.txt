Principals, teachers on sick leave today
	
Schools operate as usual: Education Ministry
Principals and teachers unions yesterday confirmed that they would go ahead with the island-wide one-day token strike today against making appointments of principals and teachers for political victimization, the Ceylon Teachers' Union said.
Speaking to the Daily Mirror, the Union?s Secretary Joseph Stalin said they had decided to launch the token strike after failing the discussions with the Prime Minister and Law and Order Minister Ranjith Madduma Bandara yesterday evening.
?All the teachers' and principals' unions held a discussion with Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and Law and Order Minister Madduma Bandara over the issues. We requested the PM to provide immediate solutions on recruiting teachers and principals who have political backing. But the discussions were failed. Finally, the unions decided to go for the strike today,? Mr.Stalin said.
During the discussion, the PM and Minister Madduma Bandara said that they will consider and provide solutions to political appointments of teachers and principals, he said.
Accordingly, the Joint Teachers Services Union, Lanka Teacher Services' Association and Sri Lanka National Principal's Union confirmed their participation in the strike action.
Mr. Stalin said if the authorities failed to provide acceptable solutions for their issues, the token strike would be continued as an indefinite strike.
Mr. Stalin said the union had informed all teachers via SMS about the token strike and not to come to school after applying sick leave.
The Sri Lanka National Principal's Union President, Parakrama Weerasinghe also said that they informed all the principals not to come to schools and not to mark their attendances.
Meanwhile, the Education Ministry Media Secretary Kalpa Gunaratne, quoting Education Minister and Deputy Minister said, it is a right to launch a trade union action, but that cannot be a threat to others who are not in the unions. He noted that stern disciplinary action would be taken against those who threaten teachers who are reporting for duty today and not affiliated to any trade unions. Government Schools will function as usual. (Chaturanga Samarawickrama)

DPA, 03rd JULY, 2018
?Iran keeps its promises, President Hassan Rouhani said Tuesday in Switzerland, ahead of a planned meeting between the chief diplomats from Tehran and five key countries focused on salvaging a 2015 deal to set controls on Iran?s nuclear programme.
?In these times, problems can only be solved through close cooperation between governments and peoples,? the Iranian leader told a press conference in Bern after meeting his Swiss counterpart, Alain Berset.
?When we promise something, we honour that promise - like the nuclear deal and our cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA],? he said.
Chief diplomats from Iran and five major powers are planning to meet on Friday in Vienna to find a way to salvage the deal, Iranian news agency IRNA reported.

Ruwan vehemently condemns Vijayakala?s statement
	
Responding to a remark by State Minister Vijayakala Maheshwaran stating that LTTE organization should return to govern the North, State Minister of Defense Ruwan Wijewardene, making a special statement, said that he abhors her view on the matter and vehemently opposes it.
The State Minister pointed out that by stating that the LTTE should return to provide security to the children in the North, Ms. Maheshwaran had displayed her ignorance and it is also amusing that she had forgotten in such a short time how this ruthless organisation, who enlisted the children of people in the North and East to fight as child soldiers while also turning out suicide bombers while committing many more atrocities, killed her own husband among several other Tamil politicians.
He pointed out that for three decades the people of the North and East as well as other parts of the island were targeted by this terror outfit and vouched that the present government and the Tri-forces and other forces would not leave room for the LTTE to raise its head ever again in the North and East and elsewhere.
State Minister Ruwan Wijewardene reiterated that as a people's representative Ms. Maheshwaran should know better than to make such an irresponsible statement which could be construed as one threatening the security interests of Sri Lanka and that it could warrant legal action.

S. Thomas? College releases its  latest chronicle
	
S. Thomas? College, Mount Lavinia Warden Rev?d Marc Billimoria being presented with ?100 Years at Mount? chronicle by Sidath Gajanayeke
?
?
?100 Years at Mount: A History of S. Thomas? College at Mount Lavinia, 1918 - 2018? was unveiled at a ceremonial launch held on June 19, 2018,? in accordance with the 100 Years at Mount celebrations held earlier in the year.? ?
The function took place at the Main Hall of S. Thomas? College, Mount Lavinia, with Dr. Nimal Sandaratne, a prominent creative writer, economist and an Old Boy of S. Thomas? College, taking seat as the Chief Guest. Thomian School Prefects, House Prefects, Sports Captains and Club Heads were present at this occasion.?
?It is very essential for the present generation of Thomians to know where they have come from, where they have to go and how best they can get there. It is vital that they have a sense of their history, their roots and their past, in order for them to appreciate their present and press on for the future,? said S. Thomas? College, Mount Lavinia Warden Rev?d Marc Billimoria in his welcome address to the audience.? ?
?

?
The Warden further stated how the past 100 years have seen the school face its toughest challenges and accomplish much.? ?
This book contains an extensive documentation of the school?s history over the past century and will serve to educate Thomians, both young and old, on the Thomian heritage and their Alma Mater over the past 100 years.? ?
It is divided into two parts. Part One consists of the history of S. Thomas? College from 1918 - 1993 and Part Two consists of the subsequent happenings from 1993 - 2018.? Part One is a revised edition of ?75 Years at Mount? written by Rev?d Marc Billimoria in 1993, during his time as a staff member of the school. Part Two has been authored by a committee of Old Boys headed by Oshanthaka Cabraal and Sidath Gajanayaka, both former School Prefects and current members of the academic staff. The committee consisted of Warren White, Darren White, Senal Seneviratne, G. Neelaghandan and Vidath Samararatne, all of whom had illustrious careers at S. Thomas? College.? ?

?
?Thirty pages of reading an hour a day amounts approximately to 36 reading hours, just a little over one day. Hence, we do not want to overwhelm you with this tiresome task,? stated Gajanayaka during his speech, at the weight of the monumental task entrusted to them.? ?
The book comprises 13 chapters. Each chapter spans through the reign of a single Warden, with two chapters for Warden De Alwis, whose term in office is mentioned in both Part One and Part Two as ?75 Years at Mount? was written during his tenure.? ?
?
The Warden further stated how the past 100 years have seen the school face its toughest challenges and accomplish much
Part One of the chronicle ?100 Years at Mount? contains the story from ?Warden Stone?s ambitious yet spirited task of transferring a well-established school in Mutwal to a new location?, as pointed out by Cabraal and ends with the fifth year in office of Wilfred Michael Neville De Alwis as Warden. Part Two is the continuation of the same and carries all information from thereon to the end of the year 2017.? ?
Dr. Sandaratne was introduced by the Warden as ?no stranger to S. Thomas? College and just the right person for the event with his background in the industry.?? ?
Dr. Sandaratne talked fondly about his days in the college and how there was a radical change during World War II and how the school was scattered and brought together during this time.? ?
He stated, ?Life at the college was never the same. It was anew and brought back to life after the wars.?? ?
This event also marked the first appearance of Bishop of Kurunegala Rt. Rev?d Keerthi Fernando since his Episcopal Ordination and Enthronement in January 2018.? The function was made colourful with a performance by the De Lanerolle Brothers awakening the nostalgic memories of the past 100 years into life for Thomians from all walks of life, through a most apt song for the occasion.? ?
Rt. Rev?d Keerthi Fernando was also bestowed upon the honour of unveiling the updated history board at the foyer of the Main Hall, prior to the event.
It would be most fitting to quote Rev?d Roy Yin, a former Chaplain of the College, whose words were repeatedly mentioned throughout the function by all of its speakers: ?What is S. Thomas? College? The answer surely is that S. Thomas? changes from year to year. Even from day to day. When a parent says, ?I want my son to go to the school that I went to as a boy?, he?s asking for the impossible. By the time his son is ready to go to school, that school that his father went to no longer exists. For good or ill, the S. Thomas? of yesterday is gone forever. The S. Thomas? of today is you.?? ?

Speaker on Vijayakala: Opp. MPs tarnished the image of House
	
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya today said he had done his utmost in taking action against State Minister Vijayakala Maheswaran.
Making a special statement in Parliament, the Speaker said informing Attorney General to take action against the State Minister was the best option he had in his capacity as the Head of the House.
?It was sad to see several MPs behaving in an unruly manner even after I have done my utmost to take action against Mrs Maheswaran.
?Two MPs behaved in a most unruly manner using foul language. This action had tarnished the image of Sri Lankan Parliament,? the Speaker said.
Also, he said it was sad to see Parliament losing the opportunity of debating and approving an important piece of legislation.
The Speaker said the House was to debate and approve the regulations imposed under the National Pharmaceutical Regulatory Authority Bill under which the people were going to get several benefits. (Yohan Perera and Ajith Siriwardana)

SRI LANKAN ALT-RIGHT PROJECT: MARCHING TOWARDS A ?REICH??
	
?Every Picture Tells a Story? was the title of the best Rod Stewart album. The landmark Viyath Maga event at the Shangri-La Hotel opened with the image in the very first slide, which showed Gotabaya Rajapaksa with only one other person in the frame, leaning over the shoulder of the seated GR. That was Rear Admiral Sarath Weerasekara (Retd.), a notorious hawk, aggressively anti-13A agitator and Sinhala-Buddhist ultra-nationalist, rejected by the Sinhala voters of Digamadulla in the Eastern Province in favour of the non-racist progressive from the JO, Wimalaweera Dissanayake (who, it was revealed in Parliament, criticized Weerasekara?s demagoguery in Ampara during the local government election campaign). If he were in the US military, Weerasekara?s Washington nickname would be ?Mad Dog.? So what?s the Viyath Maga extravaganza?s opening photo-image emblematic of? What does it reveal and symbolize? What narrative does it illustrate??
It is not, as a senior professor pontificated recently, that the next election may see a choice between a ?weak democracy? and a ?hard authoritarianism,? but rather, what kind of ?hard authoritarianism? it is likely to be and why. This is not hair-splitting. Between one variety of hard authoritarianism and another, lies not a distinction, but a world of difference. Southeast Asia experienced ?hard authoritarianism? through decades of its modern history, as did Sri Lanka in the decade of the 1980s, with 60,000 workers sacked, a fraudulent and coercive referendum which postponed the Parliamentary elections and shut down the peaceful Parliamentary path of change. Is that our post-2019 prospect??
?
Ours will be a darker dispensation than mere ?hard authoritarianism.? It will be far more ?totalitarian? than ?authoritarian?:a ?reich?
The ?hard authoritarianism? label omits a very important concept and factor, which we have known about since the ancient Greeks, namely that of ?ethos.? It is the factor of ethos that determines the most relevant distinction between regime types and indeed, regimes. In a revised, updated version, French political thought draws attention to the factor of mentalit?,?meaning ?mentality.???
Western political scientists, with whom I would decidedly disagree in favour of a more universal political science with an Eurasian emphasis, would unhesitatingly describe Putin?s Russia, Xi Jin Ping?s China and probably Erdogan?s Turkey as ?hard authoritarian.? Be that as it may, there would be a qualitative difference between Putin?s Russia (and Russia?s Putin) and a Sinhala alt-right regime -- so different as to make nonsense of a?common classification.?
However, one may define the Russian and Chinese models, their dominant ethos is composed of the troika of rationality, realism and statism. Evidence and example are provided by the State structure and Constitutional models of both Russia and China, which provide for regional autonomy for ethnic nationalities and minorities. Given the discourse of the Hitler controversy, the solidarity for Ven. Gnanasara Thera, and the acute antipathy to ethnic power-sharing, a Sri Lankan alt-right regime will not be governed by realism and rationality.?
The ?hard authoritarianism? label is blind to a key question of political sociology: the social element or combination of social elements driving the ideology and consciousness of the Sinhala alt-right bloc. The key factor is the role of the clergy/ex-military interface, the dominant ideology, mentality and dynamics within the clergy, and its dominance within the alt-right bloc as well as its seepage into the fringes and flanks of the opposition.?
A ?hard authoritarianism? with a left-wing, conventional right-wing or centrist ideology operates within the larger spheres of reason and realism, and is therefore a very different animal from a hard authoritarianism governed by an alt-right ideology and mentality. In many cases, the alt-right is a religious right, as we know from the case of the rise of Evangelism on the Republican Right and its morphing with the Tea Party Movement, and now the hybrid, Christian Evangelical Zionism.?
What is rising in Sri Lanka is just such a religious alt-right, with the distinctive markers that define its core constituency and its social consciousness. That constituency and collective consciousness are very different from the populist base of Mahinda Rajapaksa and the JO, but is piggy-backing on it. That constituency and consciousness are also very different from the UNP constituency of the Jayewardene regime throughout its ?hard authoritarian? decade.?
Neoliberal economics and the SLFP?s abdication of the role of the centrist opposition opened a vacuum which is being filled by the confluence of four streams of social and ideological opinion: (1) The hawkish ex-military brass infuse a deep-state ideology of a National? Security State. (2) The Sinhala expatriates, attracted by the rise of the alt-right in their Western societies of domicile, transmit this ideology through newly-established networks (e.g. GSLF) into Sri Lankan politics. (3) Business, managerial, professional and academic counter-elites play the patriotic Sinhala-Buddhist card to advocate a model which would bring them preferential advantage. (4) The Buddhist clergy displays a greatly-enhanced assertiveness and seeks a political veto, while within the clergy, the initiative has shifted to the most militant elements and caucuses. It is the specific nature, ideology and consciousness of the ethno-religious alt-right in Sri Lanka that will determine the ethos of any regime it propels into office and dominates ideologically. That alt-right social consciousness will crucially shape the agenda of the government. The political behaviour and social policies of such an administration will be of such hegemonistic unilateralism, social and cultural dominance and prescription of the private, as we have never experienced.?
It is important not to overlook the determining (or ?over-determining?) effect any of the three following factors and most decidedly of a fusion of all three: (I) The character and consciousness of the core constituency of a political leader, movement and regime. (II) The role of organised religion and the clergy in society. (III) The character of civil-military relations. A political leadership whose core constituency is the religious alt?right and the most hawkish ex-military element; a growing religiosity in society and a growing dominance of the most obscurantist militant current within the clergy; a tectonic shift in civil?military relations in the direction of dominance by the latter, when put together, will constitute a regime that can only be superficially captured by the description ?hard authoritarian? and whose theocratic-militarist character will make far deeper inroads into cultural and personal freedom and private space than in almost any contemporary authoritarian regime, however ?hard.???
There will be no ?modernization/democracy? trade-off. There can be no economic modernization without social modernity, and there can be no social modernization without a modern social consciousness, none of which can be achieved through a regime dominated by a social ideology and collective consciousness of an archaic nature. The embryonic, emerging Sri Lankan scenario is of a regime type approximating that of Pakistan under Zia-ul-Haq, with its alliance between the military and the militant mullahs, as well as that of Myanmar, with its axis of the military, the militant monks and Wirathu?s ?weaponised? ethno-Buddhism. Ours will be a darker dispensation than mere ?hard authoritarianism.? It will be far more ?totalitarian? than ?authoritarian?:a ?reich.?
Where Wijeweera, my old foe, would have read the writing on the wall, sounded the alarm and mobilised publicly and massively, the JVP and FSP are silent. Adopting an ostrich posture, they?appear foredoomed.?
Cosmopolitan civil society liberals are pathetic. When one expected a hundred liberal voices to sign a petition denouncing the ?Hitler/military rule? reference, they signed up to denounce my nomination as ambassador to Russia instead! This NGO underworld is the least credible and most discredited element in our society.?
Nazism triumphed because the anti-fascist vote was divided in 1933. The local alt-right (with its ?National Socialist? allies and nativist neo-Nazi inflections) will triumph if; (a) it captures the candidacy and (b) its electoral opponent is a neoliberal-elitist cosmopolitan rather than a youthful populist patriot and pluralist-democrat with an inherited vote-base, who can claw back the Sinhala vote.? ? ?

Sweden beat Switzerland to reach quarters
	
Sweden reached the World Cup quarter-finals for the first time in 24 years after Emil Forsberg?s deflected shot earned a scrappy 1-0 win over Switzerland on Tuesday.
This was far from a classic at the Saint Petersburg Stadium and if Colombia or England?s players were watching on from Moscow, they could be forgiven for feeling bullish about their prospects in the last eight.
Switzerland?s Michael Lang was sent off in injury-time for a last-ditch push on Martin Olsson and referee Damir Skomina downgraded his penalty to a free-kick on the edge of the area. But the game was already up.
Forsberg?s second-half strike, which deflected off the unfortunate Manuel Akanji, means Sweden are through to the World Cup last eight for the first time since 1994 in the United States.
Their route to the quarters has not been easy and, what they have lost in the individual brilliance of Zlatan Ibrahimovic, they appear to have gained in grit, determination and collective spirit.
Their next opponents would be foolish to take them lightly.
The one blemish on the victory was a yellow card for defender Mikael Lustig, who will now be suspended for the quarter-final in Samara on Saturday.
Both sides had been hampered by suspensions here too, with Switzerland more badly affected. They were without both Fabian Schaer and captain Stephan Lichtsteiner at the back, prompting Johan Djourou and Lang to come in.
For Sweden, Gustav Svensson replaced Sebastian Larsson in midfield.
After back-to-back penalty shoot-outs, Brazil versus Mexico and Belgium?s pulsating comeback against Japan, there was always a danger this last-16 tie would struggle to deliver, even on low expectations.
It was a contest that lacked quality, particularly in the final third, where both teams were often painfully imprecise.
Victor Lindelof slipped on the ball in the first 10 seconds and that set the tone for the first half, which was largely a collection of mishit passes, heavy touches and skewed shots.
There were chances and Sweden had most of them. Marcus Berg blasted over when set free early on and then saw his finish blocked following a poor clearance by Swiss goalkeeper Yann Sommer.
After a slow start, and Lustig?s foul on Josip Drmic, Switzerland grew in confidence and should have scored when Blerim Dzemaili snatched at Steven Zuber?s pull-back.
At the other end, Albin Ekdal was even closer, and completely free, when he sidefooted Lustig?s cross over.
Rather than let loose, both teams tightened after the interval, and Forsberg?s goal came out of the blue. With space on the edge of the box, his dummy did for Granit Xhaka before the shot was helped in by the outstretched foot of Akanji.
Switzerland twice went close to grabbing an equaliser, as Djourou?s header dribbled agonisingly across the goal-line and substitute Haris Seferovic drew a late save from close range.
Olsson was pushed in the back by Lang with only Sommer to beat in injury-time, with Skomina initially awarding a penalty but changing his decision to a free-kick after he consulted the replay. Lang?s red card stood and Sweden held on. (capitalfm)

Undergrads exchange fisticuffs over SMS
	
A clash that broke out between two groups of second year students of the Engineering Faculty of the Polgolla Open University over a SMS yesterday was broken up by the Katugastota Police.
The contents of a message sent by a second year student of the faculty to a fellow student had been interpreted as a threat and and argument that had ensued had escalated into a brawl, police sources said.
The security unit situated at the university had been unable to intervene in the brawl.
However with the intervention of the Chief Inspector Jayantha Samarakoon OIC of the Katugastota Police, the parties to the dispute were summoned to the police station and given a dressing down. The two rival groups left the station after having signed the police record book and given an assurance that they would not resort to this type of behaviour that would bring discredit to the university.(Dammika Gunawardene)

UNP to hold disciplinary inquiry
	
The United National Party is to begin disciplinary proceedings against State Minister Vijayakala Maheshwaran today (4), Party Spokesman Harin Fernando announced yesterday.
Minister Fernando told Daily Mirror that they had asked Ms. Maheshwaran to appear before them today for an inquiry to be conducted into a statement attributed to her calling for the resurgence of the LTTE in the North.
Meanwhile, it was announced that State Minister Vijayakala Maheshwaran is to clarify her statement that had created a huge controversy in the country on Friday (6).
Minister Fernando told a news conference yesterday that Ms. Maheswaran will publicly clarify what she said in her statement at a media briefing to be held on Friday. ?I have spoken to Ms. Maheshwaran who is in Jaffna at the moment and she had agreed to go before media and clarify her statement. According to what Ms. Maheshwaran told me it is clear that what the media has reported is not what she actually said. However I am not going to come out with any details now as I want to leave it to her to clarify her own statement,? he said.
Minister Fernando said the UNP rejects any statement which calls for the resurgence of the LTTE and will carry out a disciplinary inquiry against Ms. Maheshwaran. ?We in the UNP do not want to see another Prabhakaran emerging in the North and neither do we want to see a Hitler coming out of the South,? he added.
Minister Fernando, who touched on the recent New York Times report, said former President Mahinda Rajapaksa should submit an affidavit if he had not obtained money from any Chinese Company. ?It was revealed one year ago that the company that constructed the port and offered to get into a partnership with the Sri Lankan government had offered only Rs. 700 million, claiming that the cost of construction was the said amount. However, the former government claimed that it spent Rs 1.7 billion for the construction of the Port. One could see what the New York Times is talking about when looking at this situation,? he added.

Creating a ?Happiness Hub? and addressing a letter to the family of each and every employee for their sacrifices made were among the highlights.? ?Associates were welcomed offering juice, fruits and sweets through the entire week.

WILL OUR PROBLEMS EVER END?
	
As I said in my last article, the things that are happening around us today could justifiably be classified as ?Man?s Inhumanity to Man?!!! Though this disaster does not seem to impact our financial situation, it does impact our lives, because it directly affects the lives of all of us, particularly our children!!! On average parents or adults? diaries could read as follows: 1,250 Facebook Friends, 588 Twitter Followers, 743 What?s App Friends; and despite all this, when tragedy strikes, the man in the ICU has only his wife and children and his parents outside!!!??
The very people he NEVER HAD TIME FOR!!! ISN?T IT TIME THAT ALL OF US MOVED OUT OF OUR IMAGINARY WORLD AND SPENT SOME REAL TIME WITH OUR FAMILIES AND IN OUR HOMES!!!
?
Nightmare called day-care
?The other horror that most parents are COMPELLED TO LIVE WITH TODAY IS ?DAY CARE?!!!
Oh yes, ?DAY CARE? and OLD AGE HOMES ARE HUGE BUSINESSES TODAY, HUGE!!! A reputed engineering firm has also branched out into ?DAY CARE? and horror of horrors, we hear that a little girl had been locked out of this Caring Centre for 4 hours as the parents had a real problem and were unable to come and get her on time!!!
The little girl is pictured in a video that went viral screaming her head off and banging on the door to be let in!!! Hearing her cries the neighbours had called the Police, who came to the rescue!!! Most of the ELDER?S HOMES ARE RUN BY REPUTED DOCTORS; generally speaking, most of the places are well kept though the quality of food leaves much to be desired!!! Complaining does not get you anywhere either!!! Looking at it from a religious point of view, most of the Homes are Buddhist, some Anglican but the same cannot be said for the Catholics!!! The COMPASSION preached by Lord Buddha seems to permeate the culture of the majority of Homes being Buddhist though money is invariably the bottom line!!! Sadly, however, with the exception of one reputed Home, the Catholics cannot lay claim to any such acts of compassion, monetary or otherwise!!! Apparently one or two of the Homes lack sufficient toilet facilities, which is something unheard of in this day and age, but is still happening!!!
?
?
No value for life
Moving on, ?Man?s inhumanity does not seem to be limited only to Man but to Beast as well?!!! Look at the shocking massacre of that poor leopard, could they not wait till the Wild Life personnel returned??? What was the hurry to get rid of that poor beast??? Are these the tenets of Buddhism that should be practised in a Buddhist country such as ours??? Unfortunately, our country does not levy hard punishment on those responsible for these dastardly acts!!! Why talk about beasts when a contract was given on the life of a Buddhist Monk!!! It seems money is of no concern to these ruthless people who resort to such violence, and the same can be said of the hooligans who accept these contracts!!! Is Human Life that cheap??? IS HUMAN LIFE OF NO VALUE??? We read of so many lives being taken with the least amount of provocation!!! One miserable excuse of a father threw his 3-year-old son into the river because his wife did not give him money to drink!!! We call ourselves Buddhists and HUMANS!!! WHAT KIND OF HUMANITY IS THIS???
?
Dashed Hopes
We, as citizens of this country, voted for GOOD (YAHAPALANA) GOVERNANCE, BUT AS VOTERS WE NEVER GOT WHAT THEY PROMISED AND WE EXPECTED!!!??
It is not going to take long before the next elections when the VOTER IS MOST CERTAINLY NOT GOING TO BE FOOLED BY GOOD GOVERNANCE THIS TIME!!! WE SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO TAKE A CASE AGAINST THEM, BUT WE CANNOT!!! ALL OUR HOPES WERE DASHED!!! HOWEVER, WHEN THE NEXT GOVERNMENT IS VOTED IN, PERHAPS WE CAN FIND A WAY TO BRING ?GOOD GOVERNANCE? TO JUSTICE!!!
?
MIG AND BOND?
?
We need to ask just one question TO WHOM DOES UDAYANGA WEERATUNGA REALLY BELONG??? It seems that MR is more powerful than INTERPOL!!! MR says he can bring him back!!! Is he doing a favour for this Government, for himself or for UDAYANGA??? THE OUTCOME IS GOING TO BE VERY INTERESTING INDEED!!! VERY INTERESTING!!! What about ARJUN ALOYSIUS??? Doesn?t he also have someone like UDAYANGA who can come forward to help him??? It seems likely that someone will come forward to help ALOYSIUS TOO, VERY SOON!!! Again we ask, will they come forward or will we perhaps need to have an AUCTION to determine who will come forward for Aloysius!!!
?
?
Desperate, people ready to accept murderers
?
The people of our country are exhausted by politics beguiled and beleaguered by politicians through the ages and are now dreaming of what it would be like to be governed by a Dictator!!! Corrupt politicians have taken us to a place where we no longer believe that we are deserving of honest, right-minded, benevolent leaders like them!!!?
We are EVEN WILLING to accept that they be allowed to pocket 50%, as long as they do something for the country with the balance 50%!!! They may be murderers or have stolen billions from public funds, but they are considered acceptable as opposed to the good governance rogues and hypocrites, who say one thing and do the exact opposite!!!
They have made us believe that we are a nation of uncivilized, undisciplined, lazy, foolish citizens who can only be made productive by a Dictator!!! This has been embedded in our subconscious to consolidate their dominance and positions of power!!! We are not going to let Dictators take control or to diminish our rights as human beings so you better start taking note of the fact that we expect YOU TO DELIVER YOUR PROMISES, EVEN NOW!!!
?
The Colombo Elite
What of the poor? The Colombo society is not affected by fuel increases, tax levies, but the poor man who works so hard for a living to make ends meet, they are burdened by these and have to resort to eating potato, manioc, breadfruit, jak and other staples are grown by them!!! Yahapalana ate everything in one shot with a polkatu handa and spilt it all over themselves but MR and family kept on eating with a spoon, and their lower ranks ate with a teaspoon!!! The poor people are suffering today from the MR backlash, but if this system goes on then everyone will have to eat ala, bathala, manioc even without SALT!!! With whatever spoon you eat, SHIT IS SHIT!!!
The poor man has to stand by and watch all the LUXURY VEHICLES moving around sometimes on roads where people can?t even walk!!! The Mirigama/Enderamulla Highway is supposed to be making headway but a tortoise moves faster!!! In 2020, Yahapalana will have to exhume Thajudeen again and promise to solve Keith Noyahr and ALL the unsolved mysteries to fool the people once again!!!

A booklet to slander ?the Master Brain?
	
?
A certain group with ties to the JO has produced a booklet in Sinhala titled ?Maha Molakaru? (The Master Brain) about a bigwig in Pohottuwa, they say.
?
While arrangements were underway to bring out the booklet in print, a copy of its manuscript had found its way into the hands of the ?Maha Molakaru? himself.?
This incident had led to a big battle behind the scene, they say.?
By the way, the ?Maha Molakaru? had made a searing attack on a ?Doctor? who is said to have written the booklet at an office in the Rajagiriya. Several leading lights of the JO had been present at this meeting.?
The former strongman and other Pohottuwa big guns these days are looking for all parties involved in the conspiracy to bring out the booklet, they say.

A sad tale of two displaced families
	
Two families displaced during the landslide in Muniheenkanda Hill that caused much havoc in Kolambewa village in the Ayagama Division in the Ratnapura? District on May 26, 2017, have still been living in a part of the Kolambewa School building without receiving any attention from the authorities.
Mawarakanda Watukarage Ariyarane (50), the breadwinner of one of the families, said that the family of his elderly mother, wife and eight children were provided with temporary shelter at the school building when their house along with the furniture was razed to the ground during the disaster.
A vast area of about 10 acres in a forestation project in the hill had eroded with trees and boulders razing down to the ground three houses at the foot of the hill. Eight people, including seven members of one family, were buried alive. The army and the police who searched for the disappeared found only five bodies. Ariyaratne?s house was destroyed during the disaster, but he miraculously escaped death.
?Our village is in the Ayagama Division in the Kalawana Electorate in the Ratnapura District.? We experienced torrential rain from early hours of May 25 last year and at about 8pm there was a threat of a flood.? Towards midnight, my house was about 3ft under water. We left for a neighbour?s house.? A little while later a vast area of the hill came down with a deafening noise. Our house, with all other property and even school books of my children, was razed to the ground. We made a long trek through hard terrain to the house of a friendly gentleman. When we heard that his house was endangered due to a landslide, we went to another house a little distance from the endangered area. There were several other displaced families seeking shelter in that house. We spent about a week there until we found shelter in Kolambewa School that had already been closed for several years.? We cleared the shrub jungle that had grown and reached the level of the roof of the school building and settled in the teachers? quarters.? My daughter attained age about four months afterwards and we celebrated the occasion practising all traditional customs. My eldest son has passed his Advanced Level with two A passes and a B pass, but he remains unemployed. We have been in a predicament for want of an income to survive. Quite often boiled leaves plucked from the jungle constitute our meal. We received dry rations only for two months,? he said.
He requested the authorities to provide his family with a block of land from the state Paragahahena Mukalana. He also requested for funds to build a house and said that this task shouldn?t be postponed under the pretext of a delay in Geological Survey and a Mines Bureau report.
?
When our house went under water we left for a safer location -Nimalsiri
?
My house was about 3ft under water. We left for a neighbour?s house. -Ariyarane (50)
?
Weragala Hewage Nimalsiri?s family is the other family living within the school building. He said that his house with the furniture was buried under the huge mound of earth and boulders that came down during the disaster that claimed several lives.
?When our house went under water we left for a safer location and in the morning we found? that our house was no more. We lived at a neighbor?s house for a couple of days and settled in the Kolambewa School building.? Ayagama Divisional Secretary?s office provided us with dry rations for about two months.? We had depended on the meagre income from a tea small holding, but it was destroyed in the landslide.? Now we have been left without any family income. However the authorities are not concerned about our predicament. Our request for a block of land and funds to build a house have fallen on deaf ear.?? Nimalsiri said.
The two families requested the relevant authorities not to leave them without a fixed abode. They said they were prepared to earn a livelihood, even as manual workers or by taking to self-employment, if they had a permanent house to live in.?
?
? We will have nowhere to turn to if the authorities decide to eject us from the? school building and use it for other purposes? they? said.?
Meanwhile Ayagama Divisional Secretary Niranja Jayakody said the two displaced? families living in?
the? Kolambewa school want land from Paragahakanda Mukalana State land, but it had been declared an endangered area by the National Building and Research Organisation. The Divisional Secretary pointed out that it was not possible to allocate that land for building purposes.??
?We provided them with land near the post office on Gawaragiriya land, but they refused it. They want land from Kolambewa area. However, I will take up the issue with them and arrive at a settlement soon? The Divisional Secretary further said.?

## Title: Allegation as bad as proof
## Section: Opinion

Allegation as bad as proof
	
We need a clear and bold message and it is not coming from the Rajapaksas
?
?
Island of prosperity could easily become an island of shame and dishonesty??
People of pride and morality could easily end up as shameless rags of humanity?
?Politicians exploit weak susceptibilities of the average voter
?
?Arbitrary power is the natural object of temptation to a Prince, as wine and women to a young fellow, or a bribe to a judge, or avarice to old age...?~Jonathan Swift??
In the deep conclaves of libraries and reading houses philosophers and great thinkers exchange a vast array of ideas and thought, yet only a rare few of political leaders have come out as shining beacons studying the complex human condition and what cascades from that condition either to a benevolent or destructive effect on the future.? ?
While these great philosophers and thinkers are many and sometimes innumerable, those who chose politics as their profession or livelihood are a few and far in between. If the system of Government is democratic in structures and processes, the most cynical kind of these politicians travel to unthinkable distances to exploit the weak susceptibilities of the average voter, to gain advantage over them in order to mount the high echelons of power.??
If the system of Government is non-democratic, then the suppression of the people?s freewill and other fundamental freedoms are easy to play around with since the path to power is not through the people, as one would say.? ?
Yet, there is another system of Government that prevailed especially during the time when the notorious Rajapaksas were in that exalted position.? ?
That is an amalgam between a President and Parliament whose ascension to power was through the ballot of the voter yet the exercise of that power was absolutely dictatorial and autocratic.? ?
Owing to the inherent deficiencies in the Sri Lankan Presidential structure and organism, the concentration of enormous powers within the office of President did pave the way for easy exercise of arbitrary and draconian decisions and mean exploitation of a two-thirds majority in Parliament.? ?
Impeachment of the thenChief Justice is a clear example. Mahinda Rajapaksa, with his uncanny charm and maliciously intended role-playing, presented himself to the broad masses as a patriotic and sincere political leader. That message was very clear.??
However, if the message is clear and succinct on the surface, but if beneath that agreeable outer cover are concealed dangerous and unkind intentions of self-enrichment and immeasurable disregard for the common man, whom he most pitilessly condemned as irrelevant and exploited as pawns on a political chessboard, then the Rajapaksas and their cruel henchmen belong in Dante?s infamous ?First Circle? of hell.? ?
On the other hand, the people of Sri Lanka chose Mahinda Rajapaksa and his family as their rulers in two consecutive times. Third time was a ?No?.? ?
Although Mahinda?s message was clear and bold, but what lay underneath was exposed beyond an iota of uncertainty. Mahinda Rajapaksa and his clan did not bargain for the resistance that was shown towards their unscrupulous regime during the last Presidential Election campaign; the anger and rejection shown by the civil organizations and a smorgasbord of academics, intelligentsia and commoners was manifestly visible.
Thus far and no further, the distance the people were willing to travel with the Rajapaksas, ultimately saw an end. The frustration and the feeling of being taken for a mammoth ride by a ruler who thought that his clear message and assumed-charm would sustain his corrupt and autocratic rule forever reached its peak during the 2015 Presidential Election campaign.? ?
A Cabinet that was equally corrupt and pathetic in its approach to complex political realities, a Cabinet that was happy and content with the bones that were thrown at them by the Rajapaksa siblings was taken by sheer surprise of an electoral victory for Maithripala Sirisena, a ?commoner? himself and also the General Secretary of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP), S. W. R. D. Bandaranaike?s machine for the empowerment of the ?common man?, waited with their mouths open and minds closed. Bandaranaike?s ?common man? won the day, once again.
?
If the system of Government is non-democratic, then the suppression of the people?s freewill and other fundamental freedoms are easy to play around with since the path to power is not through the people, as one would say
Then what happened is another story to tell, or not to tell, depending on whom to tell. But the signs are no good. The utter lack of memory of the voter and the alacrity at which events unfolded and the idiotic errors of judgments committed by both President Sirisena and Prime Minister Wickremesinghe contributed hugely to the disdain on the part of the general public.? ?
The people are not blind nor are their loyalties beyond boundaries. Corruption whether it?s a part of the Rajapaksa?s ilk or associated is with the current administration, is corruption, period.?
Furthermore, for the members of the United National Party (UNP), being out of power for almost two-and-half-decades, does not give license to indulge in the same extremities, as those who preceded them.??
Being victims of the culture of corruption created over the last few decades, these politicos have chosen to play the same game to the same undignified rules. Barring the likes of Navin Dissanayake, Ruwan Wijewardene, Sajith Premadasa and a few more, this shameful badge of corruption, allurement to money from ?perpetual corrupters?, belongs to most in the current Administration, so the rumor goes.? ?
Alleged corruption is as bad as being proven guilty of that corruption. That is the cruel side of being alleged of lack of financial integrity. The optics of the allegation is more than sufficient for those who read only the headlines and that consists the vast majority in the country.? ?
Social media accompanied with some nasty headlines and cartoons can destroy an image of a political leader. State Minister Sujeewa Senasinghe must be aware of this aspect of political image-building.? ?
?
Impeachment of the then Chief Justice is a clear example. Mahinda Rajapaksa, with his uncanny charm and maliciously intended role-playing, presented himself to the broad masses as a patriotic and sincere political leader
?
Years of good work can easily be erased and totally eliminated by a single stroke of an allegation of corrupt practice, whether financial or otherwise.
It is this hodgepodge of governance and politricks we are dealing with today.? ?
But the voter does not care a damn about the nuances. His wants and desires must be met, at least half way, and tangibly. A sincere attempt by the politician is seen by the voter immediately and his allegiance to such genuine characters in this not-so-genuine profession could last a longer time than to others who openly exploit the profession with shameless proficiency. Dudley Senanayake was a personification of such honesty and integrity.??
All these nuanced explanations might go unheard and unseen by the immediate cohorts of these politicians; yet the cryptic observations of the voter still matter. It should be a lesson for those in the UNP, who aspire for leadership in the future. Whether it?s Navin, Sajith or anyone else, these fundamentals of leadership and management of mass movements have not changed and they will not.??
In the current political environment in Sri Lanka, a clear and bold message with a craftily assembled organization would still be an unambiguous way to power.? ?
The UNP and the SLFP are running out of time. While the Rajapaksas and the ?Pohottuwa?-gang have been slinging mud at the present regime in every occurrence possible, being engaged in the running of the country?s economy and its disentanglement from unbearable debt burden caused by the Rajapaksa regime and offering that as a reason or an excuse will not be accepted by the voter, common man or otherwise.??
The Rajapaksas devoured the country?s wealth and good name. Their extent of corruption, nepotism and autocratic rule is not easy to surpass.?
Their indulgences are beyond the pale. Their avarice had no reasonable border. In short, they were not good rulers for the country. But the people must not be left to choose between two bad choices. If the people are condemned to choose the lesser of evil, it?s extremely injurious to the fabric of society; such condemnation would result in the people settling down to a mundane mediocrity.? ?
As it was with a decadent Roman society in the long drawn out fall of its Empire, our people too would begin displaying sheer disregard for decency; they would show callous concern for honesty and what looked like the beginning of the fall may have gone away too far to contain.?
That is not an alluring prospect for an island nation that showed tremendous potential in the nineteen eighties. An island of potential prosperity could easily become an island of shame and dishonesty; a people of unmitigated pride and morality could easily end up as shameless rags of humanity, meandering in a desert of hope and barren inspirations.?

Archives publicise Section C-350 of Bond Report
	
The Section C-350 of the Central Bank Treasury Bond Commission Report which contains call records of COPE members and former Finance Minister relating to the Treasury bond controversy had been publicized today by the National Archives upon a request of the Presidential Secretariat, the National Archives Department said.
The Section C-350 of the report consists of 127 pages.
Earlier, Secretary to President Austin Fernando sought Attorney General Department advice whether releasing the report would create an impact over the ongoing investigations into the scam.
The report was publicized after the Attorney General had informed the Secretary to President Austin Fernando, releasing the report will not have an impact on ongoing investigations into the scam.
Centre for Human Rights (CHR) Executive Director Rajith Keerthi Tennakoon said the interested parties can obtain a hard copy of the report for around Rs 12,875 and a soft copy for Rs 5,255 from the National Archives.
He urged the Secretary to the President to publish the rest of the report as immediate.
The Sections C350 to C360 of the bond commission report was handed over to the speaker of parliament by the Presidential Secretariat on June 5.
Politicians and civil society activists demanded the release of several redacted documents of the bond commission report believing them to contain details of individuals including politicians who had accepted money from either Arjun Aloysius, Perpetual Treasuries or companies connected to the Perpetual group.

Checkmated by an unseen hand
	
?
It is now part of history that the Pohottuwa party had to field a proxy independent group at the election to a local body not very far from the metropolis when their official nomination list was rejected.?
?
The independent group won most seats, but the discovery of some of the members to be residents from areas outside and the absence of the legally required number of female members led to a big ruckus and a legal wrangle. Later six elected members from the independent group resigned making way for six female members from the list to succeed them.?
The gabby madam, the former chairperson of the council was among the six that succeeded the resigned ones. And she was all agog about the seeming prospect of getting re-elected to the chair.?
However, the madam had to suffer a severe disappointment when an unknown maneuverer had ensured the independent group member already occupying the chair was to continue in office.?
It was too late for her to take any remedial action when she learnt that the Pohottuwa?s Diyawanna member of the area had got the independent member already occupying the chair to join his own cartwheel party, a constituent of Pohottuwa itself!??

China refutes so-called 'debt trap' over SL's Hambantota port project
	
China and Sri Lanka are committed to pushing forward cooperation on the Hambantota port project and realizing the goal of making Sri Lanka the logistics center of the Indian Ocean, said a Foreign Ministry spokesperson on Tuesday.
"This is not only conducive to the economic development of Sri Lanka, but also conducive to regional interconnection and the common prosperity of regional countries," Spokesperson Lu Kang told a press briefing.
Lu made the remarks in response to allegations that appeared in US media reports, which stated that China's acquisition of the Hambantota port from Sri Lanka highlights its "debt trap" and ambitious use of loans to gain influence around the world.
Lu said such reports seriously distort the facts, which are either irresponsible or under the orders of people with ulterior motives, "We hope that the relevant media will not be keen on fake news."
The construction of the Hambantota port is the wish of successive governments and people of Sri Lanka, said Lu, adding that China encourages its companies to cooperate with the Sri Lankan side according to commercial principles and on the basis of equality and mutual benefit.
"According to the needs of Sri Lanka, Chinese financial institutions have provided support to Sri Lanka in solving the financing gap. Later, the Chinese side made efforts to adjust relevant asset allocation according to the wishes of the Sri Lankan side," said Lu, noting that those arrangements will benefit the business cooperation between the two sides.
"If the fabricators of the so-called 'debt trap' can not give the developing countries real help, they can at least take a healthy attitude towards the sincere cooperation between other countries," said Lu. (China Daily)

CID probes on NY Times report: PM
	
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said today following a complaint lodged by Deputy Minister Ranjan Ramanayake, the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) had launched an investigation into the article appeared on New York Times that at least US$7.6 million was dispensed from China Harbour?s account at Standard Chartered Bank to affiliates of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa?s election campaign.
In response to a question raised by UNP MP S.M. Marikkar, whether the Government would appoint a Commission and investigate the allegation made by the article, the Premier said the Police had handed over the investigations to the CID and that necessary action would be taken after the investigations were concluded.
Mr Wickremesinghe said New York Times had claimed that its journalists had been threatened and added that it was a disgrace to the country's image and demanded that such threats should be withdrawn.
The Premier said the Joint Opposition resorted to violent and indecent behaviour disrupting Parliamentary affairs on Tuesday with a view to suppress the allegation made by the New York Times. (Ajith Siriwardana and Yohan Perera)

Efforts underway to form common alliance for next Presidential Polls
	
?
Health Minister?Dr. Rajitha Senaratne speaks to?Dailymirror about plans for the next presidential elections and the reasons for antagonism between the President and the Prime Minister.?He shared the?following views:-
?
?Q??The government has reached the tail end of its term. German Ambassador to Sri Lanka Jorn Rohde insisted that the government should implement the reform agenda. How do you see the government?s performance in retrospect?
Of course, the government has done a lot. No other government has delivered on its campaign promises than us. The problem is that there is scant publicity for what we did. We established democracy in terms of appointing independent commissions and enacting the Right to Information Act. There is no white van culture now. We ensured judicial independence. Today, there are so many court rulings against the government even. The court case on the move to arrest former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa has dragged on for two years. He has become a legally immune person in the virtual sense. People are under the impression that the judiciary is in connivance with the opposition. That is because we have given judicial independence to such an extent.?

The President?s SLFP got 14% of votes. These are voters who cast their ballots against Mahinda Rajapaksa in 2015 as well. All these parties stood for a common candidate - President Sirisena
?
?Today, even the Ministers? relatives are not spared by the law enforcement authorities. Even they are arrested if they are involved in criminal acts. We increased the salaries of public servants. We did a lot of development work. The previous government, during its ten years, built only 162 km of expressways. Our government has already undertaken to construct 192 km.??
?
?Q??You said there was scant publicity for what your government did. You are the Cabinet spokesperson. Isn?t that your failure then?
The government got only the publicity I gave during my weekly Cabinet briefings. I countered allegations against the government. Yet, only limited airtime is allocated to us in the electronic media. The Media Ministry should carry out a consistent publicity campaign. That Ministry is meant to do it. But, there is dereliction of duty on the part of the Media Ministry.? ?
?
?
?Q??You said you did so much for people. But, for the first time in history, the ruling party lost the local government elections. Why did it happen??
The conduct of free and fair elections is one reason. The Elections Commission conducted the election exercising its power over the government institutions in the run up to the polls. Everything was under scrutiny. There was no way for anyone to offer inducements for vote catching.? ?
However, the number of votes polled by the government in 2015 is still intact. The parties that were together in 2015 contested separately this time. When the votes polled by each of them are added up, we still have 51% of votes.? ?
?
?Q??Actually, Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) led by President Maithripala Sirisena campaigned against the United National Party (UNP). Therefore, how do you put together the votes polled by these two parties, for example, into a common basket?
The President?s SLFP got 14% of votes. These are voters who cast their ballots against Mahinda Rajapaksa in 2015 as well. All these parties stood for a common candidate - President Sirisena.? ?
?
?Q??How feasible is it to bring all these parties together under a common front under the current developments in view of the next presidential elections?
I had talks with President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe on the need to unite all these parties and forces in respect of the next election. Both the leaders agreed to it. Yet, it is not an easy task. The SLFP questions the possibility of getting votes if they stick together with the UNP. If we form a common alliance under a new symbol and contest, we can get the required percentage of votes for victory again. I strive for it now. That is to form a front under a new symbol.?
?
?Q??Yet, there is antagonism between the President and the Prime Minister. In fact, they take on each other openly. Is it possible to unite them again?
The President behaves in such a manner to hold his vote base. Otherwise, it will slide towards the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP). The President acts to prevent that.??
?
?
?Q??Does it mean that the President is engaged in a political gimmick?
?The President is trying to prevent the anti-UNP voters from joining another political force. Instead, he is trying to attract them to his party.? ?
?
?Q??The UNP MPs say that they have made a mistake by supporting a common candidate on the two previous occasions. How can you prevail upon them to agree to a common candidate once again?
Such ideas prevailed within the UNP even at that time. They insisted that party leader Ranil Wickremesinghe should contest even in 2015. Yet, we fielded a common candidate who won eventually. Those who crow over today enjoy their perks because we fielded a common candidate who could win. Otherwise, the UNP would never ever have come to power.? ?
?
In the UNP, we find those with extremist views. Also, in the SLFP, we find some persons who are overly traditional in their political views. They flaunt their anti-UNP rhetoric. It is empty rhetoric. In the past, we used to view those against capitalism as ant-UNPers. At that time, the SLFP supported the nationalist bourgeoisie. The leftist parties gave leadership to the proletaria
?
?Q??Whom do you hold responsible for disunity between the two leaders?
Anyone speaking against this unity is held responsible. People want unity. They see those working against the unity government as traitors, be they ministers or MPs.??
?
?
?Q??Which party is held more responsible for disunity??
In the UNP, we find those with extremist views. Also, in the SLFP, we find some persons who are overly traditional in their political views. They flaunt their anti-UNP rhetoric. It is empty rhetoric. In the past, we used to view those against capitalism as ant-UNPers. At that time, the SLFP supported the nationalist bourgeoisie. The leftist parties gave leadership to the proletariat. The UNP was identified with the capitalist class. It was the enemy of the leftist leaning camp as a result. Today, the context is different. The SLFP also embraced capitalist ideas after Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga and Mahinda Rajapaksa.? ?
?
?Q??Who is the next presidential candidate in your mind?
We will announce just prior to the elections.? ?
?
?Q??Some within the government say that President Sirisena should be the candidate, while UNP General Secretary Akila Viraj Kariyawasam says the PM Wickremesinghe would be the candidate. What are your views on this?
At the last presidential election, there were different names mentioned as presidential candidates. Finally, we fielded someone media never guessed.? ?
?
?Q??You mean to say that someone will be nominated in a similar fashion this time too?
Yes, it could happen.? ?
?
?Q??In that sense, is it possible for someone to defect from the SLPP and contest as the candidate?
We cannot rule it out either.? ?
?
?Q??Last time, you had a manifesto to implement the 100-day programme, dealing with the UNHRC process etc. What are you going to tell people next time?
We have a lot to say this time. We resurrected the country from an international trap. We gave concessions to people and established democracy. We will tell people how we are going to build on them.?
?
?Q??The German Ambassador raised concerns about the failure to implement Constitutional Reforms. How do you react to it?
We will seek a mandate to form a stable government to implement what we could not do this time.? ?
?
?Q??What do you mean by ?them??
There are matters related to Constitution-making, reconciliation etc. If not for the change in 2015, the Rajapaksa government would have faced economic sanctions. That is the very reason for Mahinda Rajapaksa to advance the presidential election at that time. Our government forges ahead today without any international interference.? ?
?
If those involved in terrorism in the South can be commemorated, the same would apply for those in the North. That was what I said. We cannot differentiate between the two races on this issue. If we ban such events, we have to do it for all. It was a commemoration of war-dead. It was confirmed even by former parliamentarian M.K. Sivajilingam
?
?Q??Today, there are changes in the international context. The United States has pulled out from the UNHRC. Your comments on this...
The UNHRC will be weakened in the absence of the US. The UNHRC influence on the countries likes ours would begin to fade.? ?
?
?Q??So you say it is a positive development...
Rather than talking about its pros and cons, it is better to improve the human rights record of our country in conformity with international covenants we have ratified. We cannot deviate from it.? ?
?
?Q??As for the next presidential election again, how do you view Gotabhaya Rajapaksa as a candidate from the other side?
They are at a loss to identify the candidate. It has become a tussle within the Rajapaksa camp. The country was stuck in the hands of the Bandaranaike family in the past. We resurrected it from that family. Now, the country is getting stuck in the hands of the Rajapaksa family. There is a tug-of-war among the Rajapaksa brothers to become the next candidate.? ?
?
?Q??Recently, you came under attack in the social media over some remarks made by you on the commemoration of terrorists killed during the war. What did you mean actually?
If those involved in terrorism in the South can be commemorated, the same would apply for those in the North. That was what I said. We cannot differentiate between the Tamils and Sinhalese on this issue. If we ban such events, we have to do it for all. In this instance, it is a commemoration of war-dead. It was confirmed even by former MP M.K. Sivajilingam. My critics were silenced by the act of hospitality by the military personnel stationed at Nanthikkadal. They offered thirst quenching beverages to those returning from the commemorative event in Mullivaikkal. That was a meritorious act by war heroes in the real sense. Still there are shrapnel embedded in my body.? ? ?
?
If not for the change in 2015, the Rajapaksa government would have faced economic sanctions. That is the very reason for Mahinda Rajapaksa to advance the presidential election at that time. Our government forges ahead today without any international interference

England beat Colombia to reach World Cup quarter-final
	
England beat Colombia 4-3 on penalties after Eric Dier scored the decisive spot kick to send them through to a World Cup quarter-final against Sweden.
England had previously lost all three World Cup shootouts and three of four in the European Championship but prevailed on Tuesday when Mateus Uribe and Carlos Bacca failed to convert, leaving Dier to win the game for England.
It was the first time Colombia had been involved in a World Cup shootout and they took first blood when Jordan Henderson missed his spot kick - but for once fortune smiled on England.
Earlier, Harry Kane smashed in a 57th-minute penalty, his sixth goal of the tournament, and England looked to be through until Yerry Mina headed an equaliser in the third minute of stoppage time. (aljazeera)

Flying high!
	
The Royal Air Force (RAF) aircraft put on an amazing show of strength as they rehearsed their flypast today ahead of the air service's 100th anniversary celebrations next Tuesday.
Helicopters and fighter jets zoomed across the mostly clear sky above Lincolnshire as they prepare to dazzle spectators next week in London.
The RAF will mark its centenary year by showcasing up to 100 jets, helicopters and aeroplanes from a range of different eras, including Spitfires and modern state-of-the-art aircraft, in the speculator event.
Weather and serviceability dependent, it is expected the new cutting-edge stealth fighter F-35 jets will feature in the celebration, as well as helicopters including the Puma, Chinook, Juno and Jupiter.
Aircraft from the Battle of Britain Memorial Flight including the Dakota, Lancaster, Hurricane and Spitfire are also part of the line-up, as are training aircraft including the Prefect, Tucano and Hawk.
The Hercules, Atlas A400M, C-17, BAe 146, Sentinel, Voyager, Shadow, Rivet Joint, E-3D Sentry, Tornado GR4, Typhoon and Red Arrows are also set to appear.
Wing Commander Kev Gatland said the weather across the holding areas, where the aircraft take off from, over London and the areas they disperse to afterwards is key and may affect the numbers involved.
If the weather is bad or unsuitable in any of these areas, some aircraft may not join the flypast or it could be cancelled altogether.
The aircraft will take off from where they are based and fly into their designated holding areas - this is where they will circle and move into their formations until it is time to join the flypast.
It is expected the flypast will begin to form up over Suffolk to the west of Ipswich at around 12.45pm before heading towards Colchester, and then Chelmsford.
The formation will continue over the M25, Stapleford Abbotts, Hainault Forest and on to central London - passing the Olympic Park, Hackney, Bethnal Green and Shoreditch before getting to The Mall at around 1pm.
Wg Cdr Gatland said: 'The front aircraft, the helicopters, are doing 90 knots, so about 100 miles an hour, the back aircraft, which will be the Red Arrows, are doing about 300 knots - just over 300 miles an hour.
'They obviously compress, they are at their tightest when they go over Buckingham Palace with a 30-second spacing in between.
'At that point we need to geographically deconflict them all safely using height, track lines away from each other and timing to keep them all clear.'
Wg Cdr Gatland said the aircrafts will be stacked between 1,000ft and 1,200ft above the ground. He said their heights are alternated 'through wake turbulence' and to provide space if the aircraft 'happen to get too close'. (Daily Mail)

Fulbright Specialist Programme  established at Japura Uni
	
The problem solving is done with the help of virtual media
The project highlights the progressive spirit shown by the University of Sri Jayewardenapura over the years
?
The United States-Sri Lanka Fulbright Commission has initiated a unique project where a group of students at University of Sri Jayawardenapura and three IT organizations have got involved in a collaborative problem solving exercise. The problem solving is done with the help of virtual media. The project affords an opportunity for the industry to witness the problem solving capabilities of students. The programme also gives the students exposure to real life industry problems. The project highlights the progressive spirit shown by the University of Sri Jayewardenapura over the years. Dr. Ramya Jeerasinghe, Deputy Director of the United States-Sri Lanka Fulbright Commission facilitated the arrival of Prof. Premadasa from USA for the project.? ?
United States Fulbright Specialist and University of Wisconsin Professor of Mathematics Kirthi Premadasa is coordinating this project with Dr. Ravindra De Silva of University of Sri Jayawardenapura. Three leading software organizations, IFS international, Creative Software, and CodeGen International are participating in this unique project. Several Faculty members of the Department of Computer Science of the University of Sri Jayawardenapura are enthusiastically collaborating in this project, which is poised to serve students in the years to come. Ananda Dehisgaspitiya, Dr. TGI Fernando, and Dr Ravindra De Silva are offering the first set of courses for the project. This innovative project was created under the inspiring patronage of Vice-Chancellor, Prof. Sampath Amaratunge and Prof. Sudantha Liyanage, the Dean of the Faculty.? ?
The project is offered in two different forms to benefit the special degree and general degree students. As a part of this project, Computer Science Special Degree Students at the university will get an opportunity to conduct ?live? problem solving sessions with industry professionals as part of their coursework. Industry Professionals, with the support of the professor in charge of the course will design a collection of problems, which they will collaboratively solve with the students using a collaborative platform such as Twitter or Slack. The initial courses that will be part of the project include Artificial Intelligence, Human Computer Interaction and Machine Learning.?
A ?good? problem is one, which usually takes good collaboration and a considerable amount of time to solve. Professors usually run out of class time before students can attempt such a problem. Thanks to virtual communication platforms such as Twitter and Slack, professors now have the opportunity to overcome this constraint. They now have the technology to provide university students the opportunity to solve such problems outside the class time, collaboratively over a period. Prof. Premadasa has done significant research on instructional technology and was chosen by the World Learning section of the US State Department as a Fulbright Specialist to conduct this project. His significant classroom experience in Sri Lanka as well as in the United States should contribute to the success of this project.? ?

?Through this method, the industry will get an opportunity to present good problems that will enhance the technical and problem solving ability in students, creating a mutually beneficial outcome. The successful participation of this project will be a requirement for the student grades in the courses.? ?
The project offered to the general degree student has connections to the ?flipped classroom? model, which is popular in the United States and world over. Each participating company will first present a short video of a concept, which they would like students to study at home. Once students watch the video and familiarize themselves with the concept, the company will then invite the students on a ?field trip? to the company, where they will participate in a problem solving session based on the video with industry professionals. This ?field trip? will also provide one of the first exposures to the students of an industry-working environment.? ?
Research Assistants Udaka Manawadu and Kavindu Madushanka , who serve as the student coordinators for the project, feel that students at the University of Sri Jayawardenapura have enthusiastically endorsed the project and appreciates its usefulness for the student body for years to come. Forty-one students in the third year are currently participating in the project.? ?
?
The project is progressing according to the plan and a formal inauguration ceremony will take place on July 5? (Thursday) at 10 am at the Faculty of Applied Sciences.

JO hints Mangala behind NYT report
	
The Joint Opposition today hinted at the direct involvement of Finance and Mass Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera behind the controversial New York Times Report, which alleged that a Chinese company had funded the campaign of Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa in January 2015.
Joint Opposition member MP Shehan Semasinghe told a news conference that Minister Samaraweera?s anxiety had revealed that he was behind the New York Times report, which was aimed at tarnishing the reputation of Former President Rajapaksa.
He said such moves were also earlier carried by some parties prior to the Presidential Election in 2015 targeting Mr Rajapaksa and added that the Government was currently also in an attempt to repeat the same agenda in order to gain more votes at the forthcoming decisive elections in the country.
?A US State report has revealed that the US has funded US$ 585 million for three countries including Sri Lanka, Myanmar and Nigeria to establish Good Governance through Presidential Election in 2015. The New York Times should also make revelations on this matter. The Government should also be answerable,? he said.
Meanwhile, Joint Opposition member MP Kanchana Wijesekera said the two local journalists, who were involved in the controversial New York Times report were close affiliates of Minister Samaraweera.
He said a report, similar to the New York Times report, was earlier carried out by a State newspaper in 2015 by the same journalists indicating their involvement in the New York Times report.
?This New York Times Report has targeted the upcoming elections. The Government is in an attempt to conceal the burning issues in the country, including the uprising underworld activities, with these kinds of false reports,? he said.
?We would like to make an open invitation to NY Times International Editor Michael Slackman and South Asia Correspondent at Times, Maria Abi-Habib to arrive in Sri Lanka to discuss the controversy with their findings. We are ready to bear all the needed expenses,? he said. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)

Lessons From The Past For LG BODIES
	
A former Curator of the Royal Victoria Park Nuwara Eliya and senior citizen Austin Wijetunga is in procession of historical evidence of his own town Nuwara Eliya as well as how the Local Government system?in (Ceylon)?Sri Lanka evolved,?beginning 1892.??
Wijetunga, elaborating on how the Local Government System originated in his own town, says that the colonial rulers initially introduced a Board of Health and Sanitary Board, for Nuwara Eliya?in 1892.
Six years afterwards they had replaced it by introducing the Board of Improvement. This Local Government body served the Nuwara Eliya town,?until 1932.??
Thereafter, the Urban District Council System had come into operation. Nuwara Eliya gained Municipal Council status only in 1948.??
Tracing the history of Nuwara Eliya, he says the ?Little London? became a strategic point among the Britishers, due to its unexpected climatic similarities?with London.??
In 1819, it had been first cited by Major John Dave of the British Army?s Riffle Regiment. Ever since Britishers have taken immense interest to develop the township.??
The area had been badly affected with epidemic disease Malaria. Accordingly, as an initial health measure they planted Synkona trees, to obtain Quinine, but the plantation failed, until they moved to Haggala, where it succeeded.??
Among his valuable documents were the Gazette Notices of the colonial era, on Forest Conservation since 1887, and the most fascinating document he had with him was the official publication of the Association of the Urban District Councils of Ceylon, established in 1932.
The Gazette reveals that there were only 27 urban councils in the Island in 1938.??
The primary batch of City fathers Islandwide, who were entrusted with the responsibility of implementing and mobilizing, the hither to unknown Urban Administrative scheme, had committed themselves to act unitedly. As a result the All-Ceylon Association of urban District Council was established in 1932. Six years later they published the Annual UDC Gazette, to highlight countrywide Local Government activities.??
G.S. Wodmen, the Officer Administering the Ceylon Government, in a congratulatory message issued from the Queen?s House, had emphasized the usefulness of the UDC Gazette.??
The then Local Administration Minister S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike, commending the united effort to establish the UDC Association, as the body serving a very useful and genuine purpose, had said that the functions of the Association of UDC, were two fold.
Fifth conference of the Association of UDC?s of Ceylon held at Weligama on February 11th and 12th in 1938
?
?
In the past members of the Local Government Councils or even those elected as the Central Government representatives, did not enjoy enormous perks for themselves as now at the cost of public expense
?
Firstly, it provided the means of discussion and secondly, it constituted a representative body for the purpose of dealing with the Central Government.
The Association had resolved to hold its Annual conferences by turn in each District Council Area.??
Ambalangoda UDC was its first venue for the all-Island Council representatives to?get together.??
T.C.P. Fernando, President of the Association and Chairman U.D.C. Ambalangoda said that the field of Local Government constituted a training ground for National Government and indeed the Donoughmore Commissioners laid special emphasis on this fact. Many of the ablest statesmen and legislators have received their early training in the sphere of Local Government. And in Great Britain the local authorities have often been the pioneers in various fields of political activity, more especially in the direction of social improvement. The tendency in that country whose institutions often serve as a model for us is for the sphere of Local Government to increase steadily. From time to time Parliament has been compelled to delegate extended powers to the local authorities, and the number of functions now entrusted to them emphasizes their importance in the life of the public.??
Whatever may have been the various forms of Local Government before the advent of the British to the Island, the beginnings of Local Government in the forms which we know them now are not difficult to trace. Although the Gansabha appears to be an institution which has persisted from the time of the ancient kings notwithstanding the changes effected by successive European administrations, the more important units of our Local Government today have their origins in the statute book of the Island.??
The annual reports from each council which were published through their UDC gazette reveal the unique principles and their ardent commitment to uplift the living condition of their poor voters and by and large the countrywide?general public.??
The conduct and the policies of the bygone day city fathers, is exemplary and offers a lesson to some of the present day corrupt politicians.
In the past members of the Local Government Councils or even those elected as the Central Government representatives, did not enjoy enormous perks for themselves as now at the cost of public expense. More or less they performed an?honorary service.
They never had armed body guards to shield themselves from the people who gave them such official status. Nor did they ask for vehicles, mobile phones, office?
maintenance etc.
On the other hand pomposity was not the order during that era. Their minutes amply highlight their knowledge and the awareness of their functions and responsibilities.
Their annual meetings were not mere eating and drinking sessions. Their prime objective had been to survey comprehensively the countrywide local development, study foreign experience and gather available knowledge that would accelerate the progress of Local Government bodies.
Unfortunately our society is still content to let matters remain as they are, as if they expect some dynamic power to urge them on to action. It is high time the general public makes use of the Right to Information Act to unearth what had been yielded to the Nation in return for the colossal expenditures of public funds by the politicos. It is enlightening to go through some of the past council reports that had been presented annually.
?
(1) Anuradhapura:
In 1938, S. Nataraja UDC chairman Anuradhapura, commences his report with an impressive introduction. The city is as old as the Sinhalese race and its story lies written large in the pages of history. It has survived many vicissitudes and the remains of its architecture still excite wonder?and admiration.
In area it is 9 ? square miles with a population of 9,700, revenue Rs. 78,311/= continue fully.
The city was made the Capital of Ceylon (circ 4th Century B.C.) by King Pandukabhaya.
The whole city was placed under an officer called Nagaraguttika (later Nuwara Ladda), who was made responsible for its sanitation and policing. The post was held in very high esteem and the king?s uncle was the first Nagaraguttika of this city. Paranavitane, the Epigraphical Assistant to the Archaeological Commissioner, to whom I am indebted for this information, informs me that reference is made to a Nagaraguttika in a pre-Christian Brahamic inscription found at Alagamuwa, near Anuradhapura and that references have been found in inscriptions dated the 10th century A.D. to an officer called Nuwara Ladda (one who has received the city). The remains of an ancient waterworks, drains sewers, bathrooms, water closets, urinals and latrines are found in many parts of the city testifying to the high degree of perfection attained by the ancients in matters of sanitation and public health.??
?
Whatever may have been the various forms of Local Government before the advent of the British to the Island, the beginnings of Local Government in the forms which we know them now are not difficult to trace
?
Though the improvements made by the present local authority regarding these matters will look puny when compared to what had been done during those good old days, yet the Anuradhapura Urban District Council can lay claim to some substantial improvements that had been effected since its inception in 1933.
As a result of the measures taken, the health of the town has vastly improved.??
(a) One of the first tasks undertaken by the Council was to improve the roads in the town. Today we have 5 ? miles of fully metalled and tarred roads, whereas, when the Council took over there were no tarred roads at all.
(b) A pure water supply scheme, is now under consideration and it is hoped that within a year work on the scheme will be commenced.??
(c) Two new markets, have been built??
(d) Surveys are being made for the purpose of formulating a drainage scheme for the town.?
?(e) An electric lighting scheme, was completed in 1934 and extensions were made in 1936. Today we have a full 24?hour supply of current and the scheme is paying its way.??
(f) A Town Hall and U.D.C. Office are now in the course of construction. The architecture of the building is in keeping with the ancient buildings of the town.
?
(2) Nuwara Eliya
E.C. Misso, J.P., U.P.M., Chairman, U.D.C., Nuwara Eliya had submitted that the Council was established on January 1, 1933, in place of the Board of Improvement which had been in existence since 1898 and which left it a legacy of a wisely-administered town with a pure and abundant water supply, good roads and paths, beautiful amenities, a large surplus balance and a singular freedom from zmotic disease.??
The normal population is 8,000 which rises up to at least 10,000 during the ?Season?.The area is divided into 8 electoral divisions.??
Pidurutalagala, the highest mountain in Ceylon, is its prominent landmark. The Nanu Oya and the Hawa Elita with their tributaries meander through the town into 2 artificial lakes, Lake Gregory and the Hawa Eliya Lake. Lover?s Leap waterfall associated with a tragic legend, the Unique View and Ladies? Waterfalls are delightful items of landscape.??
Two trunk roads serve the town connecting it with all important centres.??
The water supply comes from the three intakes situated in the hills. A scheme for augmenting and improving it has been sanctioned at a cost of over Rs. 400,000.

(3) Similarly Dehiwala ? Mt. Lavinia Chairman C.W.F. Pereira, presents an interesting account of the activities and performances.??
?
UDC Office Nuwara Eliya
?
Dehiwala ? Mount Lavinia Town is 6 1/3 square miles in extent and has a population of 41,600.
Dehiwala ? Mount Lavinia is a town of recent growth. Twenty-five years ago, in this area was a group of villages with few narrow lanes and innumerable footpaths, serving as thoroughfares. The dusty P.W.D. roads to Galle passing through this town were the only roads of any size.
The population was less than one-third the present number. These hamlets, except Ratmalana South, came within the Colombo Sanitary Board about twenty-five years ago. The Sanitary Board according to the limitations of its Constitution had no elected members, and except for a very short period, it had not even, a nominated representative from this area.??
?
The whole city was placed under an officer called Nagaraguttika (later Nuwara Ladda), who was made responsible for its sanitation and policing. The post was held in very high esteem and the king?s uncle was the first Nagaraguttika of this city
?
During the regime of Sir J.G. John Fraser, G.A. as Chairman, Sanitary Board, a definite town improvement scheme on loan money was initiated. Fraser looked far ahead and planned various schemes, but his progressive ideas were very much in advance of the progress in thought of the people, most of these did not materialize. Fraser being however fully convinced that his schemes were necessary to meet the growing demands of this suburban town,
brooked no opposition and acted in a manner which was then regarded by the residents as severe and even autocratic. Not being able to secure the co-operation of the residents in the contemplated improvement schemes, Fraser, after opening up certain areas in the northern part of the town, and building what is now the U.D.C. Office, and Dehiwala Public Market, turned his energies to other areas under the Colombo Sanitary Board.??
Now, with the test of time, the wisdom of Fraser?s town planning programme?is appreciated.
With the granting of Local Self-Government in 1929, the scattered hamlets consisting of Dehiwala, Kalubowila West, Kalubowila East, portion of Kirullapone, Nedimala, Nikape, Pallidora, Karagampitiya, Kawdana, Galkissa, Watarappola, Ratmalana North and Ratmalana South were formed into a township to be administered by the Urban District Council of Dehiwala-Mount Lavinia.??
Dehiwala ? Mount Lavinia has grown rapidly and is daily growing in importance. At present there are 34 ? miles of roads. Out of this figure over 20 miles of roads are not less than 20 feet in width. The Zoological Gardens, the Railway Workshops and the Aerodrome are recent institutions, adding to its importance.
Following population figures, together with comparative statistics of the neighbouring town will give some idea of its growth.??
?
? Literacy ? In 1921 the literacy of this town was 51% for males and 15% for females. At the same census, the literacy of Colombo city was 54% for males and 20% for females. No literacy figures are available from the formal census of 1931, but it can be stated without fear of contradiction that literacy has gone up rapidly within the last ten years.??
The Free Ayurvedic Dispensary is now fully reorganizedand two Ayurvedic Physicians in addition to the paid resident physician serve the public.??
(4) Major Montague Jayawickrama had been Chairman Weligama U.D.C. during 1938.
A gazette report by Annesley de Silva discloses an inspiring account.??
Weligama is in extent of 2 square miles with a population of 10,100. Revenue :Rs. 25,521.??
The beach, is Weligama?s chief glory, and the sea bathing the finest and the safest in the Island.??
There is an island close to the shore which rises from the sea like an emerald set in coral. That is Taprobane, the residence of a noble gentleman ? The Count de Mauny.? ?
Turn away from the beach and wander into the little town. History has not passed Weligama by. One of the most striking traditions of the place is concerning the statue of Kushta Rajah, carved in high relief in a niche hollowed out of the rock.??
A temple of interest is the Agra Bodhi Vihare. Within the precincts, is a Bo-tree planted during the time of King Devanampiyatissa. Shortly after the sapling from the sacred Bo-tree at Buddha-Gaya (India) was brought to Ceylon and planted at Anuradhapura, 32 seeds from the same tree at Buddha-Gaya, are said to have been brought here, and the first of these, reckoned to be the chief (and so called Agra), was planted at Weligama.??
Go to Weligama, where the air is salt and sweet, mingled with the scent of sea and earth. To inhale it, is like drinking a fragrant wine.??
Lets hope and pray that these lessons become an eye opener at least for some of our present Local Government representatives.

Looking for candidate beyond their own leader
	
?
Who should be our party horse at the coming big poll race?
?
This is the question nowadays one Green party worthy would ask another colleague of his whenever they get an occasion for a chit-chat.?
Speculation on this question keeps mounting notwithstanding the young secretarial one?s repeated assurances that their candidate would be none other than their present party leader.?
The name of an enterprising offspring of a former holder of the coveted office is often mentioned in various quarters in this connection. But some sources close to him maintain that he is not ready to run at the coming race. They have disclosed the reason to a select few; star gazers have advised that the Dasa periods he is going through these days are not auspicious enough to attain a goal so high!
Given this situation, young Green radicals are said to be in search of a popular prominent figure befitting common candidate status. Their eyes have already turned on two choices ? the current Diyawanna chair and the gangling one of national heritage fame.
Meanwhile, a sizable group of Greens, wiser from experience, is said to have vowed that they would back only one of their own this time round!

Mihin employees worked 9 months without wages: PCoI
	
One hundred employees, who were recruited to Mihin Lanka worked for nine months without salary, starting April 2008, retired Mihin Lanka employee Ingrid Catharine Guruge told the Presidential Commission of Inquiry (PCol) on irregularities at SriLankan Airlines, SriLankan Catering and Mihin Lanka today.
Guruge is the retired Ground Handling Manager at Mihin Lanka (Pvt.) Limited.
During her testimony, she informed the Commission that the Mihin Lanka had wet-leased (When leasing the aircraft with the entire crew) two aircraft from Bulgaria and Turkey in 2007 and after the expiration of their contract period in 2008, the two aircraft left the country and they had to work without salary for nine months.
?Mihin Lanka did not have flights for nine months and we hoped the new management would solve this issue,? she told Commission.
She said that during the period the CEO of the Mihin Lanka was Sajin Vaas Gunawardena and after this situation, the management had changed and Anura Bandara was appointed as CEO of Mihin Lanka (Pvt) Limited.
She informed the Commission that the employees, who were above age 55, worked under SriLankan Airlines, had retired on a Voluntary Retirement Scheme and joined Mihin Lanka (Pvt) in 2006.
She also informed the Commission that the ground handling part at the Mihin Lanka was performed by the SriLankan Airlines.
?On December 31, 2007, the SriLankan Airlines had moved out from their services of ground handling and took the equipment due to non-payment for ground handling,? she said.
?On December 31, 2007, we had to face a serious situation. Due to SriLankan Airlines moving out from ground handling, the engineering staff of Mihin Lanka had to push out the one aircraft physically to the runaway. Also, we had cancelled several flights on that day,? she informed the Commission.
She also informed the Commission that after the above incident certain second-hand German manufactured ground handling equipment were purchased by Mihin Lanka for the purpose of self-handling but there was no separate trained staff to handle the equipment and subsequently it was also handled by the SriLankan Airlines.
During her testimony, she also informed the Commission that Mihin Lanka was incorporated as a Budget Airline but the management had used that as a commercial plan.
?Mihin Lanka had the duty free facilities, food served in the flights and they had charged a baggage allowance as well,? she said.
The witness also informed the Commission that after Mihin Lanka was liquidated most of the staff had been taken back to SriLankan Airlines and all twelve routes and three aircraft which were handled by Mihin were taken over by the SriLankan Airlines Management. (Yoshitha Perera)

PC polls delayed due to lack of consensus on electoral system: PM
	
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe informed Parliament today that Provincial Council Elections were delayed as political parties had been unable to come to an agreement on the electoral system.
He told Parliament that he had discussed with political parties, Chairman of the Elections
Commission and the Speaker regarding the matter and added that political party leaders had been unable to reach a consensus on the electoral system.
"Some leaders were of the opinion that election should be held under the old system, temporarily while the others were yet to take a decision," he said.
In response to a question raised by Joint Opposition MP Dallas Allahapperuma, he said there were shortcomings of the recently enacted electoral system for the Local Government bodies and added that it could lead to unstable administration in Provincial Councils as experienced in the most of the LG bodies.
The Premier said an amendment should be brought to the electoral system if needed before the debate on the delimitation report.
Responding to a question by MP Allahapperuma whether the Government had a plan to postpone the elections indefinitely, the Prime Minister said he did not want to postpone the elections and said they would meet the party leaders soon.
Mr Wickremesinghe said he could not take a decision on the electoral system on his own and stressed the need to have an agreement with all parties.
Meanwhile, Speaker Karu Jayasuriya said he also had discussed the matter with party leaders but they could not come to an agreement on the electoral system and added that the matter could be discussed during the adjournment debate on Friday. (Ajith Siriwardana and Yohan Perera)

## Title: PC polls under mixed system: Think twice

PC polls under mixed system: Think twice
	
Elections Commission Chairman Mahinda Deshapriya has reportedly been pressing the government to hold elections to provincial councils that already stand dissolved due to the expiration of their terms. He had reportedly warned the authorities concerned that he would take stern action if the elections were not held within a particular time frame.? ?
However, the authorities can argue that it was not they but the law that prevented the polls from being held right away. The government in a controversial move had amended the Provincial Councils Elections Act towards the end of last year in order to introduce the mixed electoral system for provincial council elections as well. Thereafter, the Delimitation Committee headed by Dr. K. Thavalingam, that demarcated the wards of provincial councils, had handed over its report to Provincial Councils and Local Government Minister Faiszer Musthapha on February 19. Hence, the Elections Commission has to wait until residual matters in the delimitation process are completed to hold the elections.?
Even if the authorities finalise the delimitation process, political parties and the Elections Commission have to think twice on holding the elections under the mixed electoral system, as it was this system that created a mess in local government bodies. The system was first experimented with at the February 10 polls and the outcome was hellish. It doubled the number of members to councils as they had to be elected under the First-Past-the-Post (FPP) system and appointed under the Proportional Representation (PR) system.?
The increased number of councillors is not the only concern over the new system. Pathetically, many councils, could not be instituted by electing their chairmen and deputy chairmen for months. Many councils saw pandemonium and fisticuffs during their institution. The main cause for this was the inability of the party with the highest number of seats to command the confidence of the majority because the collective strength of the opposition parties was more. This chaotic situation is the direct outcome of abolishing the bonus seats and the cut-off point system embodied in the PR system.?
The situation would be worse at the provincial level as the same Provincial Councils Elections Amendment Act stipulates a mandatory female representation as well. It must be recalled that the mandatory female representation, despite all its good intentions, had created another mess in many LG bodies following the polls.Since the party that got the majority at most of the councils, got the candidates who contested for the wards elected, they did not have to bear the ?burden? of appointing?
female members.?
Hence, the losing parties had to appoint women as council members until the requirement for 25 per cent of female representation was fulfilled. Some parties did not return any of its members through the election under the FPP system and were required to appoint women for all seats they were entitled to under the PR system. Against this backdrop, a handful of female members have to face a plethora of males from other parties during debates.?
The steep increase in the number of provincial council members will be higher than that in LG bodies as the ratio between two electoral systems is different in PC and LG elections. Also, the mess that could be created through women representation in provincial councils would be worse as the female quota in provincial councils is 30 per cent against the 25 per cent in LG bodies.?
The Elections Commission chief was correct when he pressed the government to hold PC polls without any delay. But it will not be prudent to rush by ignoring the possible repercussions of the mixed electoral system which is already proven to be flawed. It will not be difficult to bring in necessary amendments to the existing law or to revert to the old system as both President Maithripala Sirisena and former President Mahinda Rajapaksa have expressed displeasure over the new mixed system in the wake of the February 10 elections.?
