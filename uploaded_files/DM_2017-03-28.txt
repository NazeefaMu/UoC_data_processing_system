Cave murals in Kotiyagala Mailla: A perishing  pre-historic heritage
	
Pix & text By Nayana Jeewa Bandara

The cave murals in Kotiyagala Mailla, an ancient temple that dates back to the Kandy, historic and pre-historic era, are now under the threat of destruction in the absence of maintenance and constant exposure to elements. The Archaeological authorities had expressed their deep concern on this matter.
It is observed that the ancient temple and its precincts have never received any attention from the Archaeological and other relevant authorities. Extending to several hectares from the slopes of mountain Mailla, the temple consists of several caves with carved Rip Ledges and also a reclining Buddha statue which is 27 feet in length; a target by treasure hunters.
The Kotiyagala village is located some 45 kilometres away from the Moneragala town. The historical temple can only be accessed through a difficult pathway -- through a forest that covers a distance of about six kilometres.
Our initial journey through the green was unforgettable as we encountered wild elephants. Sources revealed that this site had been discovered by a group of surveyors in 1966, and in 1967, when an Italian Archaeologist arrived in the country for the restoration of the Sigiriya Frescoes, he had visited these historical caves and attended to restore some of these murals. Other than this, there is no evidence of any local authority intervening in the matter. This was confirmed by M.R. Wijerathna, a retired Grama Niladhari of the village.
As described by Archaeologists, one of the murals which depicts a human figure mounted on an elephant-like Mammal may be attributed as belonging to the pre-historic era. In the absence of an indicative epoch, it has been difficult to arrive at a date or period, although there is a belief that the article belonged to the pre-historic era. There are many images of Damsels with flower motifs bordering them which have been destroyed. The paintings believed to have been done during the Kandyan era however remains without much destruction. A closer examination of the caves with their systematically-carved Rip Ledges indicates that the area had been under human occupation. This fact had been determined by the Archaeologists too. The presence of a Buddha statue further indicates that there had been a Buddhist temple beside these caves.
This site, recording a history of three eras, is now receiving attention, with the intervention of the Archaeological Department and conservation of the cave murals at the Mailla cave temple is now receiving attention and step by step maintenance work is now envisaged, depending on the funds allocation by the Archaeological department.
Moneragala District Assistant Director of Archaeology Nawarathne Karawgahage said no restoration work was done this year, and as the damage caused to the Murals was excessive, restoration work can be done only depending on the funds allocated. Lack of security is also a major issue and earlier, two soldiers of the Civil Defence forces were detailed at the site to provide security, but now, it is no longermade available.
The restoration and the conservation of this historical site move at snails pace due to lack of funds. They welcome a public or private institution to restore the pre-historic heritage to its
original status.

Foreign judges not the sole obsession: Mangala
	
The inclusion of foreign judicial personnel in a domestic process as recommended by the 2015 UNHRC resolution that was recently extended by two years, was not the sole obsession of the government nor the international community, Foreign Minister Mangala Samaraweera said.
The governments main concern was establishing a fair, independent and credible judicial process that will address the needs of all stakeholders, the Minister said speaking at a press briefing in Colombo today.
Reiterating several comments from a press briefing held last week, Samaraweera explained the recommendation for foreign judicial officers to be part of the domestic process was recommended as faith in the judiciary had declined under the previous regime.
We will establish a transparent mechanism that will be accepted by all and the international community knows this. The resolution is not something that is carved in stone and as the High Commissioner for Human Rights himself said in Sri Lanka, there are certain proposals they think is necessary to be followed but the final decision will be made by Sri Lanka. This was what was promoted under the system that we proposed in 2015.
Speaking of allegations of war crimes levelled against the Sri Lankan army, Samaraweera said that whether they indeed amounted to war crimes would have to be decided by a court. Sri Lanka had one of the most disciplined army in the world but there were miscreants in the system as expected in every system. If the allegations of crimes are proven the government would take legal action accordingly, he promised.
Speaking of the recommendations of the resolution that would be implemented in the coming months, the Minister said the government was in the process of exploring the contours of a truth seeking mechanism, which they hoped would be passed by the Cabinet soon.
Mr. Samaraweera was unable to divulge the exact nature of the mechanism, but assured the final product would be something that would be acceptable to all. (Nabeela Hussain)

GMOA warns of TU action against SAITM in April
	
The Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) has warned it would launch a countrywide trade union action next month April against the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM).
GMOA spokesman Nalinda Herath told the media several unions had pledged their support to the GMOA in its effort to safeguard the countrys healthcare services.
We met more than 100 unions and most of them are of the view that the SAITM issue should be resolved sooner than later, he said and added that the details of the TU action would not be revealed just yet.
Dr. Herath said some of the ministers too supported them in their fight against SAITM.
Minister Champika Ranawaka recently revealed the other side of SAITM in Parliament assured us he will take this matter up, he said and added that many are of the view that Attorney General the Health Minister and the Higher Education Minister were responsible for this dilemma.

Gota refutes claims of special unit
	
Asked specifically if he was aware of the existence of a special unit established to attack journalists, as alleged by former Army Commander Sarath Fonseka, former Defence Secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa yesterday asked whose unit Under whom and held that the army commander was responsible for every single soldier. My security was selected by Sarath Fonseka. Even my officers reported to his seniors."
His job as defence secretary was at a strategic, higher level and he did not get involved at the tactical level, he said, responding to questions at a forum with the Foreign Correspondents Association in Colombo yesterday.
Responding to questions regarding charges that army intelligence officers were involved in enforced disappearances, he said these were baseless and politically motivated allegations. Accusing Fonseka of saying things in anger, he asked how Fonseka could maintain that he did not know what intelligence personnel working under him were doing.
Rajapaksa also said that foreign Minister Mangala Samaraweera could have got a better outcome at the recent Human Rights council session in Geneva had he correctly understood the changes that have come about in the US administration.
US President Donald Trump has said he wants to look inward and not outward and our government should be able to use that opportunity, he said.
Rajapaksa blamed US State Departments officials of the Obama administration like Samantha Power and Susan Rice for targeting Sri Lankan security forces in the 2015 Geneva resolution, to which Sri Lanka renewed its commitment in a follow-up resolution this year. He remarked that these officials were focused on human rights, R2P etc. and that Power would probably write a book about how she succeeded in changing the government. Thats where the resolution came from he said.
Analyzing the changing US attitude to Sri Lanka he said that when he was Defence Secretary, the US wanted to help and they assisted by giving the intelligence coordinates to locate the LTTE ships. Bob Blake who was US ambassador at the time asked the government to sign the Acquisition and Cross Service Agreement to show the world that the US was behind Sri Lanka. With the change of government and with Obama coming to power there was a definite change in the attitude to the war, he said.
On the question of whether he would enter politics as a presidential candidate, the former presidents brother said he had not decided. However he recalled that he came from a political family whose association with politics went back to 1935, and that he had the capability to do something for the country.

Govt. trying to sell John De Silva Theatre: Artistes
	
The Society for Socialist Art said today the Government was planning to privatize John De Silva Memorial Theatre claiming that it did not have the Rs.1000 million needed for the renovation of the theatre.
Veteran actress Deepani Silva told a news conference that President Maithripala Sirisena promised them soon after he was elected President that he would take steps to expedite the renovations of the theatre but that now the government was planning to sell it to the private sector.
She said John De Silva Memorial Theatre was the only theatre which was available for the dramatists, who were not financially well off, to perform their arts at a reasonable price.
This theatre should be taken over by the Ministry of Cultural Affairs. We as artists urge the government to protect the John De Silva Memorial Theatre, she said.
Dramatist Premaratne Tennakoon said John De Silva Memorial Theatre was demolished during the previous regime without consulting the artists and those who were in the field and when we protested, the first phase was completed at a cost of Rs.322 million.
When we demanded that it should be re-built, the first stage was completed but the government is claiming it does not have required funds to carry out the second stage. When the cabinet paper was presented to the cabinet, the Cabinet Committee on Economic Management has recommended that the theatre be sold to the private sector to develop it saying that the Finance Ministry is unable to provide Rs.1000 million, he said.
Mr. Tennakoon said the Nelum Pokuna Theatre was built without consulting those in the field and added that dramatists were unable to go there even to watch a drama today.
The Elphinstone Theatre has been closed down for four years now. The Lumbini Theatre also does not have required facilities. We request the President, the Prime Minister and Cultural Affairs Minister to look into this matter, he said.
Several artists including Wasantha Wittachchi, Chandrasoma Binduhewa, Lalith Rajapaksa, Upul Mayadunne and Kosala Silva addressed the news conference. (Ajith Siriwardana)

Htota Port deal a violation of the Constitution: JO
	
The joint opposition (JO) said today the Hambantota Port agreement was unethical, beneficial to China and violates the Constitution.
It said the China Merchants Port Holdings, which would receive 80 per cent of the shares would be in a position to decide which ship enters the port and which ship should not.
Only the government has the right to make such decisions. Allowing a private company to take these decisions affects the sovereignty and integrity of Sri Lanka, former UPFA MP G.L. Peiris told the weekly news briefing.
He said the 80 per cent would later increase on the basis of the clauses included in the agreement and added that 500 acres of land belonging to the Port had been given to the company on a Rs.12,000 million lease for 99 years and said it was far below the standard value.
Mr. Peiris said the government which described the port as a white elephant and a swimming pool, initially said the income from the sale would be used to settle the loans but today it had deviated from that objective.
The Central Bank Governor says its crucial to sell the port but does not mention anything about settling the loans obtained to construct the Port, he said adding that there was no point in continuing the blame game and that the President should take the responsibility of any downfall resulting in going ahead with the port deal.
Meanwhile, MP Bandula Gunawardane said the government was hoping to receive US$400 million from the port sale but it had already wasted US$4,300 million by releasing dollars to the market to artificially maintain the rupee value against the US dollar.
It is not SLFP policy to alienate state properties. It was former premier S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike who nationalized the Colombo Port. Former president Mahinda Rajapaksa created a port at a strategic location for the benefit of people and it should not be privatized, he said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

India - A great higher education destination for Sri Lankan students

Thousands of Sri Lankan students make their way to leading educational institutions around the world in the absence of quality higher education opportunities within the country. Although costly, the U.K., U.S.A., Australia and Canada have been the leading higher education destinations for Sri Lankan students.

Also, many students seek better education institutions in regional destinations such as India, Malaysia, Nepal and Singapore. The nearest higher education destination with around 677 universities, India provides good study experiences for Sri Lankans in Medicine, Arts, Mathematics and many other areas of study.

According to the Student Sri Lanka Educational Network, a Bachelors degree in Arts, Commerce or Science in India spans for three years. Honours and special courses are also found. A Bachelor degree in professional field of study in Agriculture, Dentistry, Engineering, Pharmacy, Technology or Veterinary medicine takes four years, while Architecture and Medicine take at least five.

Enriched with diverse cultures, religions and languages, India gives the ultimate experience to foreign students. Some Sri Lankan students who shared their experiences with the Daily Mirror said although they felt homesick the first few days, they eventually got accustomed to the home-like Indian culture.


India is a feasible option for anySri Lankan student- University of Bangalore
Dishan de Silva
I grew up as a Southerner in the paradise island Sri Lanka. While I was doing A/Ls in the Bio stream, I realised that my area of interest lies beyond the borders of my country. I had many options to continue my higher studies, and I selected India, Dilshan said.

As the South of Sri Lanka did not offer Dilshan the studies he wanted, he is now following a Bachelor degree in Audiology and Speech Language Pathology at the Bangalore University.

This combination of studies together is rarely found around the world, and I am fortunate to find it in India. From accommodation to food and educational fees, India is a cheaper and a more feasible option for any Sri Lankan student, he said.

Speaking on the cons of studying in India, Dilshan said it had failed to provide the best of facilities for students, despite being a third-world country. He also said travel expenses were very high. Moreover, some harsh weather conditions and illnesses are risky concerns.
However, he said India should be the first choice for those who prefer challenging lifestyles.

During my stay, I realised that university life was not onlyabout studies- Gujarat Technological University
Thiwanka Dissanayake
Thiwanka Dissanayake, a B.E. (Civil) student at Gujarat Technological University in Ahmedabad, said he applied for university entrance in 2013 and got the opportunity with the Jawaharlal Nehru Memorial Scholarship.

My batch was the first to have international students in Gujarat. Initially, it was a very strange place for me. But as time passed, I motivated myself to have the best time of my life. During our stay here, we realised that the university life was not only about studies. Myself and 18 other students formed an association called Sri Lankan Students Association in Gujarat. We organised trips, Independence Day and New Year celebrations, parties, cricket tournaments and many more. We carried out a charity programme to help the poor around Ahmedabad for Sri Lankas Independence Day this year, he said.

Describing himself as a mummys boy, Thiwanka said he had missed home food in India. He denied the perception of many that India was not a safe country to live in.

The living cost in India is cheaper than other countries and the economy is much favourable. As a 24-year-old student, I think I have gained lot of experience more than what a typical Sri Lankan student may experience, he added.

It feels great to celebrate Sri Lankan festivals in India- Savitribai Phule University, Pune
Dhakshala Nagalingam
Dhakshala Nagalingam who schooled at St. Bishops College in Colombo is currently pursuing her BBA degree at Savitribai Phule Pune University on a scholarship provided by ICCR (Indian Council For Cultural Relations).

Living and studying here were so hard at the beginning, especially when you dont know their language. But our Sri Lankan senior students did a great job by welcoming us and helping us to settle. Apart from studies, we got many experiences such as adventures of travelling with friends, getting to know foreigners, being exposed to a variety of cultures, food festivals and handling our own finance, she said.

She said it was great to celebrate Sri Lankan festivals such as the Sinhala Tamil New Year and Thai Pongal with the support of the Sri Lankan Student Circle of Pune (SLSC), an organisation formed by Sri Lankan students in 1996.

The only problem is that the syllabuses and examination systems here are not as standard as the ones in Sri Lanka. However, all Sri Lankans are performing really well in their respective colleges. The life here was very challenging. I have mastered in cookery after coming to India. I didnt even know to prepare a cup of tea before, she said.

Easy adjustment to Indian culture- Tuan Arzad Sama
Tuan Arzad Sama from Ragama is studying BSc Microbiology at the Pune University for the last three years. Arzad, a student of D. S. Senanayake College in Colombo, said affordable costs, many chances to travel, easy adjustment to the Indian environment and identical cultures were some of the many factors that influenced him to peruse higher education in India.

Though it takes some time for a new student to adjust to the new environment in India, we being from the subcontinent did not face that situation. Food is also relatively cheaper. We could find many local ingredients used in Sri Lanka, he said.

There are so many places to explore in India- Setavya Mudalige
Setavya Mudalige (23) from Ethul Kotte is in her final year of the Bachelor degree in Business Management - International Business. Sharing her experience, she said it was a cultural shock after coming to India.

There were times I wondered if I had made the right choice in coming to India. Now I am glad that I came here to live and study as an individual in a dynamic environment. Besides, India is huge and there are so many places to explore.


The experience has been greatRabindra Bharati University, Kolkata
Dilshanya Wijesekara
Hailing from Maharagama, Dilshanya Wijesekara (22) of Visakha Vidyalaya in Colombo was another recipient of the ICCR Scholarship. She did her A/Ls in the Arts stream and chose India to pursue her passion in Music. She is following her BA (H) in Vocal Music at the Rabindra Bharati University in Kolkata.

I was lucky in getting the chance to study in India, the most famous country for classical music.. So far, the experience has been great, she said.
Dilshanya said she too faced the language problem, but was now able to converse in Bengali, the official language in Kolkata.

Former president Mahinda Rajapaksa fermented division within the United National Party (UNP) rendering it helpless while most of the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) members are from UNP, Minister Chandima Weerakkody said today.
He told a media conference said the majority of the SLPP MPs who were in the UNP defeated during the previous government and that the district rally "Beginning of a Revolution" organized by the JO at Habaraduwa was not a threat to us.
The damage has been done to them. None of them talked against the UNP at the rally. Only about 20 per cent were from Habaraduwa. The organisers could not even collect 5,000 people from other parts of the country. These people are carrying out a contract as far as I know. They split the SLFP and showed their bankruptcy at the rally. Every political party likes to see the weakening of other parties. People hope to talk about policies and the countrys future. We are not afraid of the JO but we love the members because they were SLFPers. Now we now fear for their future, the minister said.
He said the SLFP May Day Rally would be held at the Gatambe Grounds in Kandy as planned. (Chaturanga Pradeep)

Former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga has said that anyone proven guilty of murdering innocent civilians under the pretext of fighting a war will be held accountable through a due process and that accountability means being fair on both sides of the conflict.
She said this when addressing a workshop for the security forces to create awareness about the work being carried out by the ONUR and the reconciliation priorities of the government.
The workshop was held at the Jaffna Auditorium and it was hosted by Major General Mahesh Senanayake (Chief of Staff - SL Army and Commander of SFHQ-Jaffna) and Division commanders.
Under the Coordinated District Development Project, ONUR-funded Fisheries Auction Centre at Chulipuram West was officially opened. The main event was held at the Divisional Secretary's office in Tellippalai.

Pakistan starts fencing Afghanistan border in high-threat zones
	

ISLAMABAD REUTERS March 27- Pakistan has begun building a fence on its disputed 2,500 km (1,500 mile) border with Afghanistan to prevent incursions by militants, Pakistans army chief said, in a move likely to further strain relations between the two countries. 
Pakistan has blamed Pakistani Taliban militants it says are based on Afghan soil for a spate of attacks at home in recent months, urging Kabul to eradicate sanctuaries for militants. 
Citing the attacks, Islamabad earlier this month temporarily shut the main crossing points along the colonial-era Durand Line border, drawn up in 1893 and rejected by Afghanistan. 
General Qamar Javed Bajwa said initial fencing will focus on high threat zones of Bajaur and Mohmand agencies in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA), which border eastern Afghan provinces of Nangarhar and Kunar.

## Title: Streamlining consumer protection the need  of the hour

Streamlining consumer protection the need  of the hour
	
As much as consumers need to be vigilant and informed about their rights, it is the duty of law enforcement agencies to keep spurious practices adopted by companies in check. It is the responsibility of the government to ensure the safety of the public by controlling the many businesses that violate consumer rights.
During the launching of the book titled Paaribhogika Aythiyata Janatha Magak, authored by National Movement of Consumer Rights Protection President Ranjith Vithanage to mark the Consumer Rights Day, this serious concern was taken up by former Human Rights Commissioner and Rights Activist Dr. Prathiba Mahanamahewa, Bodu Bala Sena (BBS) CEO Dilanthe Vithanage and former PRECIFAC Secretary Lacille De Silva. They discussed how consumers have been ignored and why. The book raises awareness among consumers about how they have been ignored by consecutive governments and stakeholders, and provides information on how to act and react in such situations.

CAA has failed to protect consumer rights
- Dr. Prathiba Mahanamahewa Former Human Rights Commissioner and Rights Activist
Former Human Rights Commissioner and Rights Activist Prathiba Mahanamahewa acknowledged that consumers have been ignored even on the World Consumer Day.
The Consumer Affairs Authority (CAA) has failed to protect consumer rights. In Sri Lanka, we witness several issues aimed at consumers, and the main one is the government postponing local government elections -- a foremost right of consumers. The government and the Elections Commission are ignoring it. The consumers must unanimously fight for the preservation of laws that govern consumer rights. Also, illegal maritime fishing by Indian fishermen in Sri Lankan waters is a long-standing issue the government has not yet resolved, he said.
On the one hand, traders have been violating consumer rights, and on the other, relevant government authorities instituted to administer such affairs have failed to take apt and stringent measures against those traders.

"At a time when the entire world is discussing about building a digital world trusted by consumers, we in Sri Lanka have failed even to protect basic consumer rights"
At a time when the entire world is discussing about building a digital world trusted by consumers, we in Sri Lanka have failed even to protect basic consumer rights. A consumer has the right to receive an acknowledgment for a paid service. Although people receive receipts for services today, they are unable to lodge a proper complaint in case there were faults in the service. The government has given priority for companies and not consumers. Government and non-governmental institutions that continue to violate consumer rights only see the mistakes committed by the consumers. The need of the hour is for consumers to voice their concerns, Dr. Mahanamahewa said.

All dealings should abide by the law
- Dilanthe Vithanage Bodu Bala SenaCEO
Bodu Bala Sena (BBS) CEO Dilanthe Vithanage said the society needed to build a digital world that consumers could trust.
Compared to other countries in the world, the place given for consumer rights in Sri Lanka is far below average. Other countries constantly investigate and verify if the entities elected to protect consumer rights abide by the Rule of Law.
If consumers complaints are found to be genuine, then strict action is taken against the particular business and the judiciary may order it to compensate the victim. However, this is not the practice in Sri Lanka. CAA, the main regulatory body in this context, should guide the consumers as well as the businesses. State authorities should ensure that all dealings in this process abide by the law. They need to be responsive to all types of queries. The consumers should urge the relevant authorities to enact digital consumer rights protection laws as the country is driven in the wrong direction in protecting consumer rights. The consumers in Sri Lanka remain disheartened to the point they are left to think twice on the guidance provided by CAA.

"Compared to other countries in the world, the place given for consumer rights in Sri Lanka is far below average"
The internet has changed the lifestyle of people. The society has adapted to new technologies. Many companies use their own databases to spam consumers through emails, which is ethically wrong. Government authorities should be aware of these malpractices. If not, the general public will be misled. During the previous regime, we formulated a consumer protection policy by adding key fields including education, healthcare, food and transport that are directly applicable to consumers. But, with the Yahapalana government coming to power, this policy has been sidelined. Today, the government authorities treat consumers like slaves, Mr. Vithanage said.

Ministers lavishly spending public funds
- Lacille De Silva Former PRECIFAC Secretary
Former PRECIFAC Secretary Lacille De Silva said lack of proper economic behaviour resulted in consumer ignorance.
A UN report stated that the allowances obtained by ministers couldnt be increased above 7%. But, unfortunately, the allowances obtained by the Cabinet ministers in Sri Lanka have soared to some 30-40%. Although ministers are not supposed to obtain allowances for their vehicles and for the maintenance of their premises, the ones in our country lavishly spend public funds for their personal use.
On the other hand, students are not seen actively involved in educational activities and the hospitals keep running out of medicine, he said. 

"students are not seen actively involved in educational activities and the hospitals keep running out of medicine"
Mr. De Silva said lack of knowledge on rights and duties and the dearth of resources to pursue them were a few among the numerous challenges faced by consumers. Consumer rights that were limited to safety, information, choice and the right to be heard, have now progressed to rights to satisfaction of basic need, consumer education, redress and rights to a healthier environment. He emphasized the need for an effective mechanism for consumer protection.

Syrian rebel fighters take over of  IS-held airport
	

Fighters from the Syrian Democratic Forces, a US-backed Kurdish-Arab alliance on Sunday entered a military airport held by the Islamic State jihadist group in northern Syria, a spokesman said. 
The advance on Tabqa airbase comes as the alliance prepares an attack on ISs de facto Syrian capital Raqa, seeking to effectively surround the city before launching its assault. 
SDF forces are also battling for the nearby Tabqa dam, held by IS, which was forced out of service on Sunday after its power station was damaged, a technical source there told AFP. 
SDF spokesman Talal Sello said clashes were ongoing at Tabqa airbase, which IS captured in 2014. 
The SDF has taken control of more than 50 percent of Tabqa military airport. Fighting is ongoing inside the airport and its surroundings and full control of the airport is expected within the next few hours, he said. 
In a seperate report BBC reported the rebels had taken full control of the air base. 
The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitor said IS forces had withdrawn from the airbase under heavy artillery fire and US-led coalition air strikes 
IS seized the base from government troops in August 2014 and carried out one of its worst massacres there, killing up to 200 government soldiers. 
Earlier this week, US forces airlifted SDF fighters behind IS lines to allow them to launch the Tabqa assault, and on Friday the alliance reached one of the dams entrances.

## Title: Union Assurance December net up 34% over higher premiums, investment incomes

Union Assurance December net up 34% over higher premiums, investment incomes
	

Union Assurance PLC increased its December quarter net profit by 34 percent to Rs.1.12 billion largely supported by the growth in gross premium incomes and investments incomes, which rose sharply against the corresponding period last year, the financial results released to the Colombo Stock Exchange showed.
The earnings per share was Rs.19.05 from Rs.14.27 a year ago.
The gross written premiums (GWPs) rose by 15 percent year-on-year (YoY) to Rs.2.26 billion while the net investment income rose by a strong 33 percent YoY to Rs.849.3 million.
The company paid Rs.416.5 million worth of benefits and claims during the quarter, which is 13 percent higher than the corresponding quarter a year ago. 
Meanwhile, for the financial year ended December 31, 2016, Union Assurance reported a net profit of Rs.1.31 billion or Rs.22.27 a share, which the company said was a 17 percent increase barring the Rs.1.22 billion gain made on the sale of its general insurance subsidiary in early 2015. Upon regulatory-driven segregation of the business into life and non-life, Union Assurance sold 78 percent of its general insurance subsidiary for a consideration of Rs.3.66 billion to Fairfax Asia Limited, which resulted in a capital gain of Rs.1.22 billion.
The company in 2015 made a net profit of Rs.2.35 billion inclusive of the said one-off gain.
The gross written premiums rose by 19 percent YoY to Rs.8.3 billion, while the net investment income grew by 15 YoY percent to Rs.3.0 billion.
For the year, the net benefits and claims paid by the company was Rs.1.52 billion, up just 5.0 percent YoY percent.
As at December 31, 2016, Union Assurances life fund stood at Rs.30 billion with a healthy capital adequacy ratio indicating the financial strength of the business, the company said in a statement.
As of December 31, 2016, John Keells Holdings PLC held a 86.51 percent stake in Union Assurance while Whittall Boustead Limited held 7.40 percent being the second largest shareholder.
Sri Lankas life insurance industry is at a nascent stage with the penetration level still remaining slightly less than 1.0 percent of gross domestic product (GDP).
The goings could get tough for the industry with the squeezing disposable incomes with higher inflation and taxes this year.
