Are we better than Animals...? Young Tharindu has the answer
	
I think Tharindu was once an elephant (in another life). And now, he?s been born again to save the elephants.?- then Minister of Wildlife and Sustainable Development, Gamini Jayawickrema Perera said at the launch of twenty three year-old Tharindu Muthukumarana?s mammoth undertaking, The Life of Last Proboscideans : Elephants at Kadirgamar Centre on August 13.
Dedicating his gigantic work to well-wishers and the conservationists, Tharindu raise concerns about an impending danger of total extinction of Asian elephants during the Anthropogenic Holocene extinction. ??
The book?s authenticity, clarity of thought and complete production of established facts blended with original ideas makes it a very readable and moving text. ??
The chapter on Mythology makes it intermittently amusing but not overly exhaustive. ??
Tharindu deserves acclaim, and should be congratulated on his presentation of the complex events of this category of giants on land. This is perhaps a very helpful volume from the point of view of understanding the world of pachyderms. ?
?
This book should be read not only for the minute of the details of the elephant population, but also for the alerts it provides.?
?If history?s lessons were not heeded, mankind is surely destined to be consumed by them. Very occasionally a book comes along that change your life, in the sense that it alters your thinking and causes you to reevaluate the things that everyone knows. Tharindu?s book is such a book. ?
On one level, this is a book about animal kingdom, about human culture, which does not sound particularly promising. ??
One of the book?s main strengths, and most perceptible features, is the way it constructs its overarching accounts from meticulously-researched facts
The study of pachyderms can be a niche subject, and it can be arid. The book starts from what may seem an innocuous topic: However, that includes both the entire history of life on earth and the history of Proboscideans itself, and the book is notable for both its breadth and depth. It focuses in immense detail on single events. It thus offers a comprehensive overview of the pachyderm?s history and existence.?
Tharindu also challenges many of the universal beliefs about what we ?think we know? about the in intricacies of nature at a point, when the question of ?Elephant ?human conflict? is a daily topic in media and the public sense of right and wrong. ?One of the book?s main strengths, and most perceptible features, is the way it constructs its overarching accounts from meticulously-researched facts.
The Life of Last Proboscideans: Elephants, was launched at the Lakshman Kadirgamar Institute?(The Lighthouse), 24 Horton Place, Colombo 7,?Sri Lanka on Sunday,?August 13, 2017 ?
The text is straightforward, and full of well-expressed remarks or comments that reverberate long after the book is finished. ??
One of the most fascinating passages in the book is a discussion of elephant participation in religious rituals. ?
?
The book is profusely illustrated, hundreds of photographs, sketches, and illustration are included to demonstrate or accompany the paragraphs in the text. ??
He soaks up animal facts and explains eco systems; there are chapters formed around behaviours and defence systems, and an absorbing chapter on the history of life on earth. The book is divided up into several sections. His art is simple and amazing. I would say the length alone makes it better suited to upper elementary and middle-school elephant lovers. There is ample white space around the illustrations and text making it less visually distracting. ??
It would be a great way to start senior school children on their reading journey as well as their journey of learning about environment and elephants. A couple of copies should be made available in every school library. ??
A reader would value the descriptions on elephant intelligence, the intricacy of their lives and families and their skill to endure famine and human brutality. One can discover the tenderness of the animal, how the trunks that reach out and gently stroke a nervous toddler and a fierce commitment to defend their kind in the face of devastatingly superior force. ??
The book gathers almost one-and-a-half decades? worth of study on the elephant into a single volume. The book is important for contravening the decades-old hypothesis about elephant behaviour. Thus it facilitates a much more conversant approach to saving the elephant and discovering better ways to support labours that would see humans living happily side by side with these wonderful non-humans. ?There are still hunters and poachers, who shoot the elephants for their ivory. The book enlightened me on many such cruel practices. ??
Tharindu?s observations of courtship, birth, communication, death, and social structure of the species kept my interest to the end. The author is first and foremost a ground researcher with long hours of first hand observation of untamed and tamed elephants. The trouble with a lot of expert books of elephant conduct is that they almost have too much familiarity. Tharindu strikes a balance between talking scientifically relevant information while also amusing the reader. It is both good science and good writing. ??
Ever since I can commit to memory elephants have fascinated me. Their sheer dimension, their fluttering ears, the echoing and trumpeting noises they make, the unhurried and methodical way they stroll and their amazingly attractive tusks fascinated me. The author had relieved me of all my reservations, doubts and speculations. ??
Clashes between elephants and people aren?t new, but they are growing. As human populations grow, territory becomes disjointed, with elephants losing more of the space they need to live. But the solutions to human-elephant conflicts are often politically provoked and can lead to brutality to animals. Individual elephants and whole groupings may be fenced in to insignificant areas or even culled. ??
Managing such conflicts entails great care; Tharindu has a solution. ??
Finally, I admire the author for the work he has done and his dedication to the species; the world needs a few more youngsters like Tharindu Muthukumarana. ??
I would recommend that anyone pick up this book for pleasure reading as well as an interesting scientific study of the elephants.?

CIOB with HNB launches green credit card
	
The Ceylon Institute of Builders (CIOB), the pioneer which actively promotes green constructions in Sri Lanka, together with Hatton National Bank (HNB) recently launched a green credit card for people engaged in the construction industry as well as for professionals, at the HNB auditorium.?
The function was attended by CIOB President Dr. Rohan Karunaratne, Advisor Professor Chitra Wedikkara, Deputy Presidents Jayakesh Tudawe and Ruwan De Silva, Executive Member Kalana Alwis and HNB Head of Credit Cards Roshantha Jayatunga as well as a host of?
distinguished guests.?
Dr. Karunaratne expressing his ideas said that the latest trend in the construction industry is sustainable construction and green construction and this is the first time a credit card specializing in these areas has been introduced.?
He said that the green credit card would help those engaged in the sector to practice these concepts continuously by providing the much-needed finance through the green credit card.?
?I thank HNB for coming together with us to support this task,? he said.
He further said that most of the mega construction projects are undertaken by large foreign companies due to their strength in finance, manpower, material and other resources. The local companies cannot compete alone with foreign companies and this is one of the challenges faced and to win this challenge the CIOB is trying to gather all large-scale construction companies and create?
a new structure.?
?We are also having discussions with the government to get small portions of large projects given to foreign companies. The green credit card will encourage green builders and support the endeavours launched by us,?
?said Karunaratna.Jaytunga explained the significance of the CIOB-HNB green credit card and said that the entrepreneurs and professionals who are members of the CIOB can obtain this credit card, which is also valid internationally. Therefore, this credit card can be used to make payments locally as well as internationally and can pay up to Rs.1 billion while the interest is very nominal. A long time is offered to settle the credit card. In addition, when the entrepreneurs and professionals go abroad, the green credit card will help them immensely.
The CIOB has been engaged in promoting green construction for the last six years. In addition, the CIOB has launched many programmes to promote green construction and among them are issuing the CIOB green mark certificate for large-scale green constructions, organising a green award ceremony and awarding the CIOB Green Mark for green buildings, green products and green construction services, introducing the Advanced Certificate Course for Green Project Managers are some the initiatives undertaken by the CIOB. Green construction has many benefits and among them are eco-friendly, healthy, energy saving and longevity.

CP Education Secy. responsible for sari controversy: Governor
	
Central Province Governor Niluka Ekanayake today said the Central Province Education Ministry Secretary should be held responsible for allowing school children to hold a 2.5 mile long bridal veil in an attempt to set a Guinness World Record as the longest sari, as he had issued the letter giving permission.
?I strongly condemn the use of school children for this event during school hours and it is an irregularity. The President has instructed not to use schoolchildren for social events in this manner. I am not prepared to safeguard anyone. The Chief Minister made a request and obtained approval for their participation but he had not instructed to line up them along the road in this manner. However, I would hold a formal investigation and submit the report to the President,? the Governor said.
The Regional Director of Education, Tilak Ekanayake, Zonal Director M.W. Wijeratne and the school Principal had been summoned to the Governor?s office last morning though the media was not allowed to cover the meeting. The governor told the media that the secretary of the ministry of education was absent as he had to take part in some other official duty.
The Governor also said the report on the inquiry into the incident would be submitted to President Maithripala Sirisena. The Provincial Director told the media that he submitted a report to the Governor and she would release a statement on this matter. (J.A.L. Jayasinghe and L.B. Senaratne)

ICRA Lanka assigns Alliance Finance [SL]BBB-/stable outlook
	
ICRA Lanka Limited, a subsidiary of ICRA Limited, a group company of Moody?s Investors Service, has assigned the issuer rating of [SL]BBB- with a stable outlook to Alliance Finance Company PLC (AFCP).
ICRA Lanka has also assigned the issue rating of [SL]BBB- with a stable outlook to the Rs.1,000 million senior, unsecured, redeemable debentures programme of the company, currently listed on the Colombo?Stock Exchange.?
ICRA Lanka has also assigned issue ratings of [SL]BB+ with stable outlook to the Rs.480.17 million subordinated unsecured redeemable debenture programme and Rs.613.14 million subordinated unsecured redeemable debentures programme of the company currently listed on the Colombo?
Stock Exchange.
The ratings factor in the established track record of the company in the financing business, a fairly diversified lending portfolio, comfortable asset quality and a fairly diversified funding profile. The ratings are however constrained by its high gearing and moderate profitability indicators. The ratings take note of the strict loan to value (LTV) ratio for vehicle financing, which is expected to increase competitive pressure and impact business growth and margin expansion for the players including AFCP.
ICRA Lanka takes note of the company?s initiative to diversify its portfolio, which could reduce the share of vehicle financing going forward from current levels; however, ability to grow at an optimal pace in the new target segments namely mortgage loans and business loans, etc. without impacting its asset quality and generating good risk adjusted returns would be critical.
AFCP is one of the older finance company in Sri Lanka with a track record of more than 60 years. The company has presence in 89 locations (39 branches, 21 microfinance service locations, 12 gold loan centres and 17 collection centres) covering all 25 districts of the country.?
The company?s key products are leasing, which accounts for 67 percent of the total portfolio as on June 30, 2017, followed by loans (23 percent), microfinance (7 percent), gold loans/pawning (2 percent) and hire purchase (1 percent). In terms of asset classes, three-wheeler financing (21 percent), car financing (18 percent), lorry financing (12 percent), mortgage loans (9 percent) and van financing (8 percent) were the key constituents of AFCP?s portfolio.
The other key asset classes include microfinance (group lending), equipment financing, two-wheeler financing, which account for 13 percent of the portfolio. ICRA Lanka notes that the portfolio growth is expected to remain at about 20-25 percent over the near to medium term with focus on four-wheeler financing.
The company?s gross NPA ratio increased to 17.4 percent on March 31, 2014 from 2.2 percent on March 31, 2013 because of the stress on its pawning exposures. The same however improved over FY2015 and FY2016, largely on account of the large write-offs and recoveries made during the period. As on March 31, 2017, the company reported a gross NPA of 2.1 percent and a net NPA of 0.8 percent when compared to gross NPA of 2.5 percent and net NPA of 0.7 percent in March 2016.
The gross and net NPA stood at 2.6 percent and 1.3 percent as on June 30, 2017. ICRA Lanka notes that while the asset quality indicators are comfortable presently, ability to control incremental slippages, especially in the target business segments for growth, would be a key monitorable. The ratings nevertheless take note of the strengthening in the company?s management team and internal control process and systems, which provide some comfort.
AFCP has a fairly diversified funding profile comprising of retail fixed deposits, debentures and term loans from banks. As on June 30, 2017, around 42 percent of the company?s funding was from deposits, while the balance was through debentures and bank loans. Going forward, the company is expecting to maintain a 45:55 share between deposits and other borrowings. ICRA Lanka notes that Top 10 depositors accounting for 15 percent of the company?s total deposits as on June 30, 2017 indicates concentration in its deposits profile.?
However, funding lines from 12 banks and good deposit renewal rate of 80 percent provides comfort from a liquidity perspective. The company reported a positive short term (less than one year) ALM mismatch of 1 percent as of June 30, 2017, which is quite comfortable as compared to most peers.
The company?s gearing1 moderated to 8.7 times on March 31, 2017 from 9.7 times as on March 31, 2016 as the portfolio growth moderated to 21 percent (28 percent in FY2016), while the internal generation improved to 17.9 percent in FY2017 (16.5 percent in FY2016); the company also raised capital of Rs.71 million via a rights issue in January 2017. ICRA Lanka notes that notwithstanding the moderation, the capital structure is stretched on account of the high leverage. The company?s core Tier-I and total capital adequacy ratios stood at 10.0 percent and 13.8 percent, respectively, as on June 30, 2017.?
The company?s capital adequacy was supported by the issuance of Rs.606 million subordinate debenture in March 2017. AFCP?s business yield moderated from about 24-25 percent in FY2014-FY2015 to about 22-23 percent currently because of its shift to lower yielding four-wheeler financing from three-wheeler financing. Going forward, AFCP? yields are expected to be under pressure in view of the increased focus on four-wheeler financing. The NIMs have consequently moderated from 9.9 percent in FY2016 to about 9.3 percent in FY2017. ICRA Lanka notes that the credit cost increased to 1.8 percent in Q1FY2018 (0.3 percent in FY 2017 and 1.5 percent in FY2015) because of the accelerated provision made by the company on account the portfolio impacted by the recent floods and because of the additional provision made post CBSL?s review.?
The operating efficiency improved with the portfolio expansion; operating cost /ATA reduced to 7.1 percent for Q1FY2018 from 7.3 percent in FY2017 and 7.8 percent in FY2016. AFCP?s profitability (return on average assets) reduced to 1.6 percent in Q1FY2018 (2.4 percent in FY2017 and 1.9 percent in FY2016) largely because of the increased credit costs and remains moderate in relation to peers. Ability of the company to improve its profitability going forward would be crucial.

Indian BSF<U+2009>using chilli sprays, stun grenades to stop Rohingya Muslims
	
?
?New Delhi, (Hindustan Times), 23, Sept. 2017 - India has stepped up security along its largely porous eastern border with Bangladesh and is using ?chilli and stun grenades? to block the entry of Rohingya Muslims fleeing from violence in their homeland of Myanmar, officials said on Friday. ??
Prime Minister Narendra Modi?s government is growing increasingly hostile towards the Rohingya in India, with Home Minister Rajnath Singh calling on Thursday for their deportation as illegal migrants. ?
Border forces, which wants to deport around 40,000 Rohingya already living in the country, citing security risks, have been authorised to use ?rude and crude? methods to stop any infiltration attempts. ??
?We don?t want to cause any serious injury or arrest them, but we won?t tolerate Rohingya on Indian soil,? said a senior official with the Border Security Force (BSF) in New Delhi. ??
?We?re using grenades containing chilli spray to stop hundreds of Rohingyas trying to enter India ... the situation is tense,? added the official, who declined to be identified as he was not authorised to speak to media. ??
More than 420,000 Rohingya have fled to Bangladesh since Aug. 25, when a co-ordinated attack by Rohingya insurgents on Myanmar security forces triggered a counteroffensive, killing at least 400 people, mainly militants. ?

Introduce SO's to prevent amendments contradicting original Bill: JVP
	
The Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) said today provisions should be included in the Standing Orders to prevent amendments contradicting the original Bill being introduced during the Committee Stage.
JVP leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake told a news conference that they acknowledged the fact that the government had introduced amendments, which changed the core meaning of the bills presented in Parliament recently including that of the Local Government Elections (Amendments) Bill and the Provincial Councils (Amendment) Bill.
He said it had been the parliamentary tradition to do so with the previous government as well when introducing the 18th Amendment.
Mr. Dissanayake said they supported the Provincial Councils (Amendment) Bill at its second and third readings not with the intention of delaying the PC polls but of the need to change the electoral system and increase women representation in provincial councils.
He asked why the joint opposition voted against the Bill at the second reading if it was in favour of increasing women representation.
He said the JVP voted for the Bill during second and third reading because they supported the increase of women representation and change in electoral system.
Mr. Dissanayake said it was true that PC polls get delayed by four months due to the Bill and added that they wanted the Local Government election be held earlier than the elections to three provincial councils.
?If the PC Amendment Bill was not passed, the long overdue local government elections will be further delayed and elections to three provincial councils will be held earlier. We want elections for the whole country rather than to three provinces so that the government could not use its full power in three provinces and force the result like what was done by the previous government," he said.
??On the other hand it also removed the preferential voting system for PC polls as well. If it was not so there would have been two electoral systems, one for LG polls and another for PC polls. We voted for the Bill because we agreed to these changes. It would have been passed even without our support,? he said. (Ajith Siriwardana)

BERLIN AFP Sept24, 2017 ??
Chancellor Angela Merkel is expected to cruise to victory in elections Sunday but also to face the breakthrough into parliament of hard-right populists for the first time in Germany?s post-war history. ??
Voting began at 0600 GMT in Europe?s biggest economy and exit polls are announced at 1600 GMT, with few expecting surprises given Merkel?s double-digit poll lead. ??
For months, the woman now dubbed the ?eternal chancellor? has been the favourite over her centre-left rival Martin Schulz and looked set to win another term and match the 16-year reign of her mentor Helmut Kohl. ? To many in the West, a fourth Merkel victory will come as a relief in a turbulent world, with hopes she will serve as a calm-headed counterweight to US President Donald Trump and Russia?s Vladimir Putin and as the key EU ally to reformist French President Emmanuel Macron. ??

National productivity wasted on vulgar projects
	
High time to do away with nit-picking, tilting windmills over blathering politicians and dashing coconuts
It is quite discernible and palpable that our country is passing through a period of vital transformation with regard to public administration.?
A very healthy dialogue has erupted in course of a very short span of time over the historical judgment delivered by the court regarding misappropriation of public funds by two very important public servants. ?The crux of the matter is that the court itself says that they have not used that colossal amount of money for their personal use. ?The other day, some people talking at our nearby tea-kiosk generated a lengthy discussion in their conclave and came to a unanimous verdict that it was a deterrent punishment to the present breed of administrative officers not to carry out the orders of the high ups with scant care to the establishment code, so that the verdict was poetic justice.?
Some others argued that they could resort to summary justice as both parties were brothers and sisters. Since independence, they have been misappropriating public funds in their turns. Yet, another member of the village concave said that the verdict had to be hailed as the tipping point and no any other alternative was possible to arrest this game.?
This transitional Government could prepare the necessary springboard for concrete good Governance later one day. By listening to their ?pundit? talk I could call to my mind two books I had read at the university library. One is serving unto Caesar by our veteran civil servant Bradman Weerakoon and Peter Principle.?
But I for not being able to remember the great author who penned it, necessarily a guide book for amateur administrative officers. I humbly believe that if these two victims of public funds misappropriation had read these ground breaking books they might have not done this blunder and could survive as two of the unblemished honorable public servants. ?Yet, I have a great respect towards Mr. Lalith Weeratunga for his stellar performance in administrative service. He fell victim to the corrupt system that prevailed.
The ongoing tragedy is that the concerned parties, in a desperate attempt, are nitpicking and misguiding the general public. That is infra dig and could have drastic boomerang effects because of the very fact that people are very knowledgeable now.?
If they go into the matter deeply, there are surely some other ways to skin a cat. It is generally believed now that most of the politicians are playing to the gallery. That cock won?t fight. ?The children of the present population are armed with a profound understanding of the status quo with regard to almost all the public matters of national importance. They educate their parents and elders not in uncertain terms. Most of the young and immature politicos are rope walking.?
The children in unprivileged families are very angry, because they seem to know that their children are pursuing higher education in salubrious countries and disturbing the apple cart here. When all these things come out on the public platform, the leaders become unanswerable.
It is crystal clear that God has a soft spot for the people who live by their sweat. Therefore, God could be found at the places where people work under the scorching sun or where rubble is broken into pieces, where steam-rollers work making roads under the unbearable heat. -the workers or the underdog as our old red brigade said in the radical university days, when our blood was heated.?
But the utter disgrace to the economists, professors and doctors of political science is that they dash coconuts, where God is not present.?
Even when Kataragama Devale turmoil erupted and the goons surrounded the very abode, the God was not present there. In fact, stupid people dash coconuts at the wrong place. That is why they do not get the expected results from dashing coconuts. ?God sees to the interest of the less fortunate. Our gross national product is wasted on vulgar projects,?
LO AND BEHOLD!?
