A software to help fight dengue
	
The Sri Lankan doctors who developed the programme won the Commonwealth Digital Health Award in the category of Communicable diseases
Dengue has become our common enemy, surpassing the boundaries of the rich and poor, ethnicities and religions, north and south. Controlling the spread of a disease of this magnitude, with its potential to develop into a national level epidemic, is a strenuous process. This course involves many organizations, people and protocols, which naturally have their drawbacks. Two Sri Lankan doctors, who had observed and identified the shortcomings of the system, have developed a method of overcoming these obstacles for the overall benefit of the general public.? ?
The Daily Mirror had the privilege of interviewing Dr. Lasantha Ranwala (MBBS,MSc-Biomedical Informatics), Registrar in Health Informatics at the Postgraduate Institute of Medicine, and Dr Yudiswara Wedisinge ? Medical Officer Vector borne disease control, who designed the programme.? ?
?Our readers may have noticed that when a Dengue patient is identified, the relevant PHIs arrive to inspect the area. During this process fogging is done, covering the nearby area with white fumes in an effort to prevent further spread of Dengue. But how do the PHIs and the health department know exactly where the dengue patient is from? ?Dengue is considered a notifiable disease. When a patient who is suspected of having Dengue is admitted to the hospital, the details are recorded and the collecting nursing officer sends those details to the relevant MOH. The MOH then sends Public Health Inspectors to the area to take measures with the view of preventing the further spread of Dengue,? explained the doctors.? ?
?
Stats not accurate?
Even though ideally preventative programmes should be carried out the moment a patient is identified in a community in order to eradicate the infected mosquitoes before they contaminate other people, this process is almost always delayed as a result of a combination of factors. ?The system in operation is basically a paper-based system which is time consuming to say the least. It sometimes takes around two weeks for the MOH to receive notice. But this new system is totally web based, so the time is greatly reduced,? is how they talked about the flaws in the system that they have identified.
In addition they explained that in the hospital the doctors usually rely on the clinical diagnosis to report?
on Dengue, which is in no way accurate. ?We are obliged to report all suspected dengue patients. So, it?s inevitable that the patients who present with other viral fevers and a low platelet counts are also?
reported. As a result, the accuracy of these statistics is very low and only around 100 out of 150 patients reported is actually having Dengue fever,? they elaborated.?
?
Shortage of health officials
Given that there is a shortage of MOHs and ground level staff; specially Public Health Inspectors, the eradication of breeding sites becomes even less effective with these officials following false trails.? ?
In the newly devised method, this issue is mostly resolved. The NS1 antigen test for Dengue is currently done in private laboratories and is quite specific when it comes to diagnosis of Dengue. The laboratories have been supplied with the software programme free of charge. Whenever a report returns as positive for NS1, they feed those details into the programme after logging in with their user names. Then these patients will be sorted out according to the areas of their MOH and the MOH directly receives notification. A PHI is assigned to assess the situation and if it?s found to be correct the feedback is fed to the software. So the system reveals that the patient is confirmed having dengue, immediately. This is even more effective because NS1 antigen will provide information regarding the patients who aren?t admitted to hospitals as well as those admitted to private institutions.?
Pilot project?
The paper based older system is a one way system where there is no way of obtaining information on the progress of the notification sent. In the new computer based system, the feedback from each individual organization enables anyone involved in the system to discern the progress of each individual case.? ??This project was started as a pilot project in the month of August in the Colombo District. It?s still in the initial stages and we are planning on expanding it soon to be implemented in Gampaha and Kalutara Districts,? the doctors stated.? ?
This programme, which would have cost millions otherwise, was completed with no external funding, affirmed the doctors. They further stressed that with the Government?s intervention the programme could go a long way towards the prevention of Dengue. The developers of the programme won the Commonwealth Digital Health Award in the category of Communicable diseases, at the Digital Health Conference organized by the Commonwealth Medical Association in October 2017, for their invention, bringing with it a ray of hope that we can defeat the hitherto indomitable menace of dengue.

Amana Takaful celebrates World Fisheries Day highlighting Samudra Shakthi benefits
	
Amana Takaful (ATL) recently celebrated World Fisheries Day by highlighting the benefits of its ?Samudra Shakthi? insurance cover for both small and large-scale fishermen and commercial fishing companies.
ATL has a rich history that spans over 18 years, and the company has been a pioneer of the ?Takaful Way?, offering trusted insurance solutions to its customers from all walks of life.
ATL?s ?Samudra Shakthi? cover is designed to offer protection that covers all types of marine boats, except those without engines. Irrespective of the life span or expected durability of a particular boat, ATL will offer its insurance cover to any fisherman or fishing company (regardless of the size of their operation), providing them with comprehensive covers for both their boats and engines. The company has an extremely quick claims procedure and has fulfilled a total of Rs.20 million worth of claims in 2017 alone. ATL also has a deep-rooted understanding of the needs of the fishing community. The company takes pride in providing guidance to fishermen across the island and focuses on delivering reliable micro-insurance covers that help Sri Lanka?s fishing community, meet with their specific insurance needs.
Over the years, ?Samudra Shakthi? has become a source of protection and information to fishermen across Sri Lanka, and aside from providing high-value insurance covers, ATL also highlights the importance of sustainability in the fishing industry. Each year, World Fisheries Day is celebrated to draw attention to overfishing, habitat destruction and other serious threats to the environment that may be caused due to companies and small-scale fishermen, that may be over-taxing marine resources. ATL continuously strives to highlight the need to operate fishing businesses in an environmentally-friendly manner, especially since the fisheries and aquaculture industry employs more than 43 million individuals worldwide, and over 25 percent of the world?s dietary protein is provided by fish. A recent United Nations report, reiterated that two-thirds of the world fisheries have collapsed or are currently overfishing. As part of its insurance cover, ATL not only offers protection for various threats that may impact a fisheries business, the company also encourages its clients to run environmentally-sound operations that reap profits without harming the planet and ocean resources.
Commenting on the ?Samudra Shakthi? cover, Amana Takaful CEO
Fazal Ghaffoor said: ?The ?Samudra Shakthi? cover is designed to offer fishermen and larger scale fishing companies, the peace of mind that they need to effectively run their businesses. Whilst we always encourage our clients to consider their impact on the planet, we also strive to provide them with insurance covers that will protect them against a wide-range of circumstances such as marine accidents and collisions, damage to boats or trawlers as a result of natural disasters or the impact of poor weather conditions on their vessels. We try to offer our customers speedy inspections and damage assessments, a seamless process when it comes to submitting documentation and the quick delivery of claims with minimal hassle. Professionalism, reliability and excellence in customer care are the cornerstones of our services and policies, and we do our very best to ensure that businesses who are facilitating the sustainable growth of the fisheries industry, have the peace of mind, confidence and added protection that they need to run their operations.?
ATL?s ?Samudra Shakthi? insurance cover is widely used by customers across the island, from areas such as; Kalutara, Galle, Matara, Hambantota, Beruwela, Ambalantota, Negombo, Puttalam and Mannar. Customers from Mulathivu, Jaffna, Trincomalee, Kinniya, Muthur, Batticaloa, Kalmunai and Akkrapattu also rely on the cover for added protection.

An artful artiste
	
We have often heard about billionaire-businessmen in our country. But has anyone heard about a billionaire-artiste here?
?
One might be surprised to hear that a billionaire artiste, a rarity here, has put up a three-storey mansion at a cost of Rs.60 million in a city suburb.
This artiste is said to have been a buddy of a former powerful politician and had been actively involved in the latter?s political propaganda campaigns.?
The artiste has also converted the modest home he was living into a posh two-storey residence.
Inquiries have already been instituted by the authorities to ascertain how this prominent figure in the country?s art circles had accumulated assets worth billions beyond his means within a short period of time, they say.?

Answering his critics: Reflections on a lonely artiste
	
The sixth and last in a series of sketches of the films of Lester James Peries??
Lester James Peries began his career in 1956. With ?Rekava? he became Sri? Lanka?s first professional director of movies and not photographed stage plays. So simple and yet profound was the story of Rekava, so influential it was in gaining recognition for our dormant, static film industry, that no less a person than Mervyn de Silva, then writing to the Ceylon Daily News, put aside all historic and exogenous considerations, the fact that it was the 41st Sinhala film, and contended that it marked the beginning of our cinema. No film before it had strayed so remarkably from the confines of the studio, and no film before it had encountered so many troubles, logistical and otherwise.?
19 films and 60 years later, Lester has gone down in history as the only local filmmaker who has attracted praise and censure from every corner of our critical fraternity: the intellectuals, the nationalists, the Marxists, the literary experts, the purveyors of feminist cinema, and so forth. In 1974 when ?Ahas Gawwa? was released, a pamphlet was published and copies of it disseminated. It was titled ?Appochige Sinamawa.? Lester had fathered an entire generation of directors and scriptwriters and cameramen; they were now rebelling against him. He had hence bred, not slavish disciples, but independent artistes.?
?
Lester had fathered an entire generation of directors and scriptwriters and cameramen; they were now rebelling against him
The truth is that Lester, who turned 98 this year, is the last reminder of 1956 and the revolution it inspired that we have. As Regi Siriwardena noted, 1956 was no accident, but the congruence of the political and the cultural was: the one aided the other. Lester hailed from the milieu that we the people were rejecting. So had his brother, Ivan. By resorting to a visual medium, they redeemed themselves in the eyes of their people.? But there were times when those deficiencies showed, when the man seemed to ignore a key element of the milieus he was depicting in his work. It happened in Rekava, where you don?t come across a single temple. It happened again in the three epics he directed and particularly, among them, The God King. The writers in the press were tepid in their reviews, naturally. ?Jayawilal Wilegoda,? considered the first real movie critic in the Sinhala media, castigated him for mindlessly imitating the West. (According to him, this was partly proven by the man?s penchant for featuring cars, something H.L.D. Mahindapala noted in his review of Ran Salu when he observed, wryly, that the camera seemed to be obsessed with those cars.) But these critics belonged to a certain class, a certain category. The most devastating critics of Lester didn?t come as nationalists and intellectuals. They came as Marxists and literary purveyors.?
With respect to the Marxists, the problem is easier to understand. The election of a socialist government, the intrusion of the New Wave and the cinema of East Europe, as well as two insurrections that almost brought the country to a standstill proved to be too much for any critic who looked for a sign of commitment and secular upliftment in a work of art. Lester?s films did not, as I noted before, satisfy these parameters and yardsticks. They ended right when the poor and the wretched were about to suffer more (as with Akkara Paha, which culminates with Sena and Sandawathi departing to a life of destitution); they didn?t tell us how the poor and the wretched could tide over their suffering, rather that they were destined to suffer. The French, even at their most political, knew how to end their films in idiosyncratic flourishes and swipes (think of the ending of Breathless, where the dying Michel has just one thing to say to Patricia, his former fianc?e: ?You?re a real scumbag?), but the East Europeans were defeatist, adamant that their characters claim destinies they could never control. The Marxist critics looked for such characters. Lester couldn?t provide them. He hence became a betrayer.?
In the seventies when these critics rode on a high wave, they were at their peak. Regi Siriwardena frequently implied that they wanted the cinema to be politicised the same way the theatre had been. The political theatre is a vassal of ideology, whatever ideology, and the theatre of the left tends to conflate reality for symbolism and resort to explicit add-ons to depict a particular social context. It was this kind of climate that prevailed in our film industry, though unlike many other left-leaning countries it survived: the truth is that after Dharmasena Pathiraja we never had a Mrinal Sen of our own. Pathiraja created a new standard, but only he could be measured against it; no one came close to him. Lester?s standards, on the other hand, spread more widely. He didn?t indulge in political polemics, but even without indulging in them he had liberated the industry. The seventies didn?t go beyond Pathiraja, hence. It instead nurtured Vasantha Obeyesekere and H. D. Premaratne, both of whom conceived, not a political cinema, but a middle cinema.?

The political theatre is a vassal of ideology, whatever ideology, and the theatre of the left tends to conflate reality
?
?The political left continues to inhabit and make the waves in our film industry. That is its greatest virtue and worst limitation, because our independent cinema is considerably hegemonised by a left-of-centre political sphere. Our art-house film movement never really picked up owing to this, barring the early work of Asoka Handagama, because no political cinema can survive on symbols and allegories and explicit add-ons without compromising on density. Some of the movies that directors like?
Handagama make are extraordinary, and they are the result of decades of experimentation, but they are far, far away from the technical craftsmanship of the old masters. Even at their worst, a mainstream Sinhala film retains a welter of formality which the art-house director lacks. The political left?s most powerful contribution to our film industry was the independent movement, but what it lacks in this respect has been its undoing and has hindered it from reaching a local audience. It survives, as always, on private donors and film festivals.?
But it?s not just the political left or political theatre that has hindered the birth of an honest independent cinema movement. It?s also the literary purveyors, the intellectuals and academics who tend to either put down the cinema or assess the worth of a movie on the basis of its fidelity to qualities that are more suited for a book review. These are the critics who lambasted Lester and A. J. Gunawardena over Baddegama. The debate over the equivalency between two modes of narratives ? moving image and prose fiction ? has, as Gunawardena himself observed, largely grown obsolete in other countries, but in Sri Lanka, owing perhaps to the dominance of Romantic and Edwardian standards of literary criticism in our English Departments, it has persisted. Lester was a literary-minded director ? he adapted several works of Sinhala fiction, all of them landmarks for their time ? but even this was not enough to salvage many of his works, particularly with respect to the Koggala Trilogy, from criticism at the hands of those experts.?
?
Apart from these critics, the man stoically endured years and decades of criticism
Apart from these critics, the man stoically endured years and decades of criticism. He raised some flak among nationalists and intellectuals (especially Jayawilal Wilegoda) but they were transitory, because their standards could and did change. The political left and the literary intelligentsia were not malleable this way, because their standards remain stubbornly present in our cultural spheres. That he lacked commitment, that he lacked enough foresight to keep to the letter and spirit of a literary masterpiece, have been two of the most frequently cited indictments against him, over the years and including, I must add, his penultimate film, Wekanda Walawwa. They deserve to be answered, elsewhere, in full, because in those indictments we can infer Lester as Cooray?s lonely artist. ?But aren?t all artistes lonely?? Tissa skeptically asked in an essay on his erstwhile guru. The answer to that, of course, is yes, they are, but that with this artiste it was a different story.?
Lester turns 99 next year. There are others younger than him, who have made more films over a fraction of time it took for him to make his. That?s a tragedy at one level, but a blessing at another. For the films he made, though intermittent, were awaited and watched eagerly. Rekava was a leap of faith. But like all leaps of faiths, it wasn?t vindicated immediately. Sandeshaya was a hit, but that wasn?t really Lester. Gamperaliya, Delovak Athara, and Ran Salu weren?t hits, but they recouped at the box-office. And then, Golu Hadawatha, his sixth, won an entire nation to his side. Yes, it took some time. But that?s how icons operate. They are patient. Never in a hurry.?
And in the end, this gentle human being, who was never in a hurry, took his time and proved to us, in his own special way, that one can never assess the worth of an artiste by a fidelity to arbitrary standards. Whether they were manufactured by the Left, whether they were disseminated by our Universities, they remained standards that did not require their designated targets to be their vassals. Perhaps Lester himself offered the most appropriate response to them all: ?They work with symbols. I work with human beings.? He told this to me two years ago. Two years on, our filmmakers continue to work with symbols. They were inspired by him, but failed to retain that quality which defined him. They were all students who wanted to imitate, but they all repudiated his ?lan, his zeitgeist.?

Bio-piracy, an imminent issue that  needs to be addressed soon
	
Bio-piracy is a problem which we do address over the last two and half decades, but non of the former governments or the present government have taken suitable steps so far to get due revenue, proper mechanism for access and to conserve the genetic resources of Sri Lanka. Therefore it is high time to take appropriate action on this burning issue.? ?
Biological diversity or bio-diversity is a term use to describe the variety of life on Earth. It refers to the wide variety of eco systems and living organisms: animals, plants, their habitats and their genes. Bio-diversity can be divided into three categories as Eco system diversity, Species diversity and Genetic diversity. Eco system diversity refers to the variety of eco systems in a given place which includes landscapes, climate, soil, water, fire, rocks, wind, etc that functions together as one unit. The variation among species refers to the diversity that exists among species. Genetic diversity means the genetic variation among individuals of a population and that among all the different populations of the same species comprises the total genetic variation of those species.? ?
What is bio piracy???
Bio Piracy means unauthorized access of biological materials and use in commercial purposes - Obtaining monopolistic rights by an individual or a company or an institution of one country on certain biological material, while that biological material is belonging to another country. This rights obtaining could be in the form of Intellectual property rights (IPR), obtaining Patent rights, plant breeders? rights or sharing the benefits/profits.??
Being a ?bio-diversity hotspot? a large number of Sri Lankan species have high potential ability in bio-piracy. A large number of our plant and animal species have been subjected to bio piracy. As a result the country is losing in the environmental, social and economical aspects.? ?
Our Association, Lanka Nature Conservationists (LNC) comprise of the founder and early members of the Young Zoologists Association (YZA) formed in 1972 by the then Director National Zoological Gardens, late Deshabandu Lyn de Alwis, an association functioning very effectively to date. We have again re-grouped after 45 years to contribute our knowledge and experience for the environment conservation of Sri Lanka.??
A seminar was organised by the Lanka Nature Conservationists recently to build-up awareness creation and active participation to fight against? Bio-Piracy, with relevant stakeholders.? ?

Counsel Sumanthiran objects to AG's Dept leading evidence
	
At the begining of yesterday?s proceedings, President?s Counsel M.A. Sumanthiran raising an objection on behalf of his client Sangaparapillai Pathmanapanan, an official of the Central Bank's Public Debt Department, said no official of the Attorney General?s Department, coming under Section 23 of the Commission of Inquiries Act, could lead evidence.
Mr. Pathmanapan and PTL owner Arjun Aloysius are alleged to have exchanged more than 750 phone calls and several other calls between Mr. Pathmanapan and other Directors of PTL. This was while being employed at the Central Bank Public Debt Department.
Raising the objection prior to Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe taking the stand, Mr. Sumanthiran said AG?s Department officials could not lead evidence on the basis that they had acted as investigating officers.
At that point, Senior Additional Solicitor General Dappula de Livera said he objected to Counsel Sumanthiran?s appearance because of his "conflict of interest"
Mr. De Livera said Mr. Sumanthiran was a member of the 8th COPE committee and his client had been a witness at the 7th COPE proceedings which were both taken in as evidence and as such there was a conflict of interest. The objections were recorded and the Prime Minister was called to testify.
Attorney General Jayantha Jayasuriya PC then marked his appearance and said he was before the Commission under Section 23 of the Act leading the AG's Department team of officials.
At the end of the Prime Minister?s evidence Mr. Sumanthiran expanded on his initial objection and made submissions with regard to the admissibility of the evidence regarding the phone conversations which were submitted to the PCoI last week and that of the leading of evidence by AG's Department counsel.
Drawing distinction between Section 23 and Section 26 of the Act, Mr. Sumanthiran said the AG's team acted as investigating officers and thus could not lead evidence. He said he was present at the proceedings after being informed by the PCoI to do so.
The Commissioners said Mr. Sumanthiran was summoned to yesterday?s proceedings to explain to his client that none of the evidence against Pathmanapan would be used against him in the report as he was not given a chance to be heard at the PCoI.
However, they said the same would not apply to other witnesses against whom the evidence led on phone calls were incriminating, and were heard in testimony.
Mr. Sumanthiran then said Mr. Pathmanapan was interdicted on Friday following a directive from the PCoI, to which Justice Jayawardena said, "We are not running the Human Resource Department of the Central Bank".
The Commissioners said there was no directive to interdict Pathmanapan because they had not come to any findings yet. When Mr. Sumanthiran PC kept insisting that the interdiction had occurred after the evidence connected to the phone calls, Justice Jayawardena said, "That is none of our business. You take it up with them, there is nothing we can do about it?.
Justice Jayawardena said the interdiction had occurred independent of the PCoI proceedings.
Mr. Sumanthiran PC was thereafter directed to submit written submissions with regard to the objections within a week from yesterday.
Mr. Pathmanapan had earlier filed a fundamental rights application citing the AG Department's team as respondents and alleged inhuman and degrading treatment by the investigating officers.
The telephone calls include 19 calls exchange between Mr. Pathmanapan and Mr. Mahendran in addition to the telephone calls to Mr. Aloysius and other PTL directors. The telephone calls also include 30 of them between Pathmanapan and Anjali Mahnedran, the wife of Mr. Aloysius.
They include nine calls between Anjali and Pathmanapan between 8.00 pm to 8.00 am and 202 viber calls between Arjun Aloysius and Pathmanapan between 8.00 p.m. to 8.00 a.m. (Shehan Chamika Silva and Hafeel Farisz)

The study would cover the areas such as the total number and value of new advances granted by the NBFI players, the total number of customers served by the industry and the geographical distribution of customers, advances and deposits of the industry and the financial inclusion created by the NBFI sector.
Currently there are 45 registered Licensed Finance Companies in Sri Lanka, who are mainly engaged in SME finance, Microfinance and deposit mobilization.
The study is a recommendation of the Sector Stability Committee of the FHASL that has objectives such as to ensure the prevalence of a vibrant and a stable LFC sector (Licensed Finance Companies) playinga key role in serving the unbanked, to intervene in a proactive manner to information gathered through intelligence on member companies that are likely to make an adverse impact on the sector due to regulatory or other action, to react to information disseminated? ?by electronic and print media on LFCs that are likely to trigger a wave of public reaction on the LFC sector and to enter in to a dialogue with LFCs that in the opinion of the committee is experiencing issues on stability and continuity in business to assist to overcome such issues wherever possible.
The study would reveal some valuable insights in to the role of NBFIs that have enabled the financial inclusion of low income entrepreneurs in Sri Lanka for the last 60 years and potential ways and means of how the sector could contribute to accelerating economic development outside the Western Province.

?We wish to thank the Hon. Attorney General for, at our request, appearing before us today and leading his team of officers. This Commission of Inquiry made that request to the Hon.

Prime Minister of the Republic appears before this Commission of Inquiry,? the Commission said.
Following is the full statement read out by the commission:
This Commission of Inquiry would like to thank the Hon.

Attorney General because we are of the view that, it is proper and appropriate for the Hon. Attorney General himself to be present before us and lead his team of officers on an occasion when the Hon.

Speaker Karu Jayasuriya said today he would refer to the Privileges Committee the matters raised by parliamentarians regarding the telephone conversations of COPE members and have a discussion with the party leaders on this matter.
Meanwhile, joint opposition MP Bandula Gunawardana said the statement made by Minister Lakshman Kiriella on Monday that parliamentary privileges of the MPs were breached because their phone calls had been tapped was incorrect because the PCoI said such a thing had not happened.
The minister who responded to the allegation said what was wrong was to leak out the details to the media.
"We are not against the investigations but the details should be kept confidential. Leaking out information to the media is wrong," he said.
However, MP Udaya Gammanpila said people should know how the MPs act and asked why the government was trying to keep it a secret, when the Right to Information Act was now functional.
"The Presidential Commission of Inquiry is a public commission. It's proceedings should be transparent," he said. (Ajith Siriwardana)

Sujeewa says he is disappointed with President
	
State Minister Sujeewa Senasinghe today while calling to appoint Presidential Commissions to inquire into ship deals, Mig deals, spectrum deals and advertising firms, said that he is badly disappointed about the President.
He further said that he called Arjun Aloysius only to write the book about the Bond issue and challenged the CID to prove that he called to commit a fraud.
He added that he expects to take legal action in this regard in the future and noted that appointing a commission only to probe the Bond issue from 2015 was a conspiracy to destroy the UNP.
While addressing a press conference at the UNP headquarters Sirikotha in Pitakotte, State Minister Senasinghe said that the President should not become party to the wants of some people to destroy the young politicians of the UNP.
He further said: ?I am actually badly disappointed about the President. We elected him by making sacrifices. A certain organization had told the President that he could gain power in 2020 by destroying both the Rajapaksas and the UNP. I called and told him about this a month ago. What did he do by extending this commission? Mud is being slung at us by extending and extending this commission.
Where are Presidential Commissions for the Mig deals. Where are the commissions for Ship deals, advertising deals and spectrum deals? Seven billion of public money. I am telling the President that we are also of the same age as his children. If he is protecting his children, if he is being hit by E-news, in the same way it?s not correct for a certain media to attack us.
When he promised to bring 20 and only brought 4 as the common candidate, many people were not in favour of giving it to him. At that moment myself and Rosy Senanayake both said that how many he came with should not be the concern, but since he took a decision and came, we should begin the campaign at that moment. If there is a wrong-doing, implement the rule of law. If he can appoint a Bond Commission and catch thieves, why can?t he do it for the others.
I am telling the President that he willfully did not start probing this from 2008, but started from 2015. He could have easily looked at how Bonds were handled from 2008. Why couldn?t this be done when we asked him? What was done here was a conspiracy against the UNP. I am committed to protecting the UNP.
Also Handunnetti cannot ethically sit in the COPE committee. He is the first person who spoke against the Bond issue. If he holds a certain opinion on a certain matter he does not have an ethical right to Chair such a committee. We can have an opinion and sit as a member. We will not protect either Aloysius or Ratwatte.
There was a big outcry against the Bond issue. A certain media due to personal reasons made this into something much bigger than what it was. I must specifically say that I opposed when Arjuna Mahendran was first appointed. At that moment I told the Prime Minister that either Arjuna Mahendran should resign or Arjun Aloysius should resign.
When all this was happening I got a chance to get appointed as a member of the COPE. I did not have much of an idea about the Bonds. It takes about six to seven months to understand this. What I did first was to understand what these bonds were. Whatever anyone says, it was I who asked the most amount of questions from Aloysius at the COPE. His connection with Cabraal?s sister. How he got this after 2008. It was I who asked all these questions. Also it was I who questioned about the conflict of interest in his father-in-law being the Governor of the Central Bank. None of those in the opposition question him about these. I wrote a book about these and asked the Bond Commission to summon me.
I don?t need to get two cents of bribes to earn money. Therefore I am saying that this country cannot be run according to the requirements of a certain private channel. This cannot be done to run your business, to control the President, to get rid of officials. We cannot allow this to happen.
I will resign if the Prime Minister asks me to or if the people ask me to, but I cannot be stopped. " (Nimala Kodituwakku and Indika Ramanayake)
Sujeewa replies to journalists
Excerpts from the press conference State Minister Sujeewa Senasinghe had:
Q-Do you infer that by with this transaction the country has suffered no loss.
A-I am stating according to what I know. Not me it is the Supreme Court that decided there was no loss.
Q-Did the Perpetual Treasuries Company have legal right to purchase Bonds at the Primary Market.
A- It is possible in the Primary Market.
Q-Can they resell them in the secondary Market.
A-Yes they can.
Q-Has the EPF the right to purchase Bonds in the Primary Market
A-Yes they have the right.
Q-Can they resell them in the secondary Market
A-Yes they can
Q-When they could have bought them at the Primary Market, why did they opt to purchase them from the Perpetual Treasuries company on payment of 2% commission.
A-That is what you should investigate. A State institution does not take that responsibility. It is taken only by a private institution (Nimala Kodituwakku and Indika Ramanayake)

The price of freedom  Sri Lankans cry out for help from  Manus Island
	
The crisis on Manus Island continues as 421 refugees and asylum seekers refuse to leave the refugee processing centre on Manus Island to the alternative abodes provided. Twenty one among these refugees and asylum seekers are Sri Lankans. Since 2013 Australia has denied entry to anyone reaching its shores unofficially by boat. They were sent to refugee processing centres (RPC) in Manus Island and Nauru. However, on October 31 the controversial Manus Island detention centre was closed. This was following a judgement by the Supreme Court of Papua New Guinea in April 2016. The court?held that restricting the movement of asylum seekers who haven?t committed a crime was unconstitutional. Though New Zealand has made an offer to accept 150 refugees from Manus Island and Nauru, Australia has turned down the offer.?
?The refugees and asylum seekers claim that the alternative abodes are not yet ready and that their lives would be at risk. Their plea is to be resettled in a third country; a country other than Papua New Guinea and Australia.?
The refugees claim that some of them were beaten up by locals. Activists claim that even the members of the local community are victims of Australia?s policies and that the majority of local people on Manus Island were kind and generous.? ?
Unhygienic living conditions?
According to news reports, refugees are relocated to the East Lorengau Refugee Transit Centre of West Lorengau House and those found not to be refugees were relocated to Hillside Haus on Manus Island. However, the refugees and the asylum seekers have shared videos on social media which show that there was no water and air conditioners and that washing machines weren?t working. They also pointed out that there was no power at the West Haus centre. In the absence of water toilets are filthy. Journalist Behrouz Boochani, an Iranian refugee, tweeted that a refugee suffering from heart pain has been awaiting the arrival of a doctor for two days, at Hillside.? ?
The 421 refugees and asylum seekers, who have refused to be relocated, remain at the Manus Island RPC. Water, food, electricity and medical services have been cut off as the centre has been officially shut down. The shortage of clean water and food at the Manus Island RPC has raised health concerns. Boochani tweeted that some refugees needed to see a doctor immediately. Their plea for pure water has been ignored. Immigration officials have destroyed their water tanks and contaminated water in the wells with rubbish. But the determined refugees said that they will dig a well.? ?
?
The shortage of clean water and food at the Manus Island RPC has raised health concerns
Meanwhile the UNHCR regional representation in Canberra confirmed that it had observed first-hand that refugees? and asylum-seekers? most basic needs of food, water and physical security aren?t being met in the Regional Processing Centre on Manus Island. ?Access to medical care is also very limited in Lorengau, and UNHCR has observed that serious cases requiring hospitalization can?t be adequately treated locally,? the statement read. The statement further said that the forced movement of these refugees and asylum-seekers is inappropriate and should be avoided.? ?
UNHCR called on Australia to take responsibility and provide protection and safety to the refugees and asylum-seekers it has transferred to Papua New Guinea (PNG).?
?Avoiding persecution?
The refugees on Manus Island have fled persecution based on their political opinion, religion and ethnicity while some are stateless. Though Australia is a signatory to the 1951 Refugee Convention asylum seekers can?t resettle in Australia. They are sent to Manus island, Nauru and other detention centers instead. In 2013 Former Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd announced that asylum seekers who reach Australia by boat will have ?no chance of being settled as refugees.? Accordingly Australia then gave Papua New Guinea A$400m in aid in exchange for setting up the camp and resettling the refugees there.? ?
?
An Iranian asylum seeker was attacked and succumbed to his injuries while 70 other asylum seekers were left injured?
?
So far six lives have been lost at the Manus Island RPC due to suspected suicides, riots, and illnesses which didn?t receive prompt and sufficient medical attention. In 2014 riots erupted and locals entered the detention centre. An Iranian asylum seeker was attacked and succumbed to his injuries while 70 other asylum seekers were left injured.? ?
In 2015 some 500 detainees went on a hunger strike fearing that they would be resettled in Papua New Guinea where they believed their lives would be at risk. Some detainees swallowed razor blades, some stitched their lips and four drank detergent in protest. On Good Friday this year soldiers have fired almost 100 shots at the detention centre in response to a dispute causing injuries to nine people which includes refugees and staff members.? ?
?
?
Last month a Sri Lankan refugee was found dead on Manus Island and the cause of death was suspected to be suicide. He had been facing charges for sexual assault which he had denied. He had also been suffering from mental health issues.?
When the Daillymirror? ?inquired into the 21 Sri Lankans at the Manus Island RPC, activists told us that given the circumstances it wasn?t advisable to raise their profile. Meanwhile the Government of Sri Lanka (GoSL) has promised to take measures to bring back the Sri Lankan nationals in Australian refugee camps. Minister of Foreign Affairs Tilak Marapana told Parliament that the Government will bear the cost of air tickets of the returnees.

"Australia is washing its hands off international obligations"
?Lakshan Dias- Human Rights Defender?
and Attorney-at-Law
Human Rights Defender and Attorney-at-Law Lakshan Dias said that by shutting down the detention centre on Manus Island, Australia was deviating further from its obligations under the 1951 Refugee Convention. He said that Australia was running off shore refugee processing centres which was illegal under International law.? ?
He pointed out that even though some have been legally recognized to be refugees the Australian Government wouldn?t accept them. ?They will be free people on Manus Island. But Manus Island is a small territory and you can?t do anything much. If they are brought to Australia as refugees, they can work and all the facilities are available to them under the Refugee Convention,? he said.? ?
?
Even when Australia decides to deport them the GoSL can?t do anything as these asylum seekers are out of the country. It is only once they land on Katunayake Airport that the Sri Lankan Government can get involved
?Australia is a failed state because they have failed to adhere to the International law. Australia is washing its hands off international obligations,? he stressed.? ?
Referring to the statement made by the Minister of Foreign Affairs Tilak Marapana in Parliament, Dias said that ?the statement was incomplete without much legal basis.?? ?
He explained that as these people were seeking asylum in another country, Sri Lanka couldn?t get involved. ?Even when Australia decides to deport them the GoSL can?t do anything as these asylum seekers are out of the country. It is only once they land on Katunayake Airport that the Sri Lankan Government can get involved,?he stressed.?
Under International law asylum seekers can?t be sent back to their country of origin-in this case Sri Lanka- without their consent, Dias pointed out. Under the Sri Lankan fundamental rights jurisdiction citizens have the freedom to return to Sri Lanka.? ?
?He said that the GoSL could both charge and detain the returnees for violating the Immigration and Emigration Act on the grounds of leaving the country through illegal means, or offer a pardon.? ?
He observed that there have been occasions when refugees who returned to Sri Lanka were harassed. ?I have submitted to world bodies information regarding refugees facing harassment, extortion, even torture at the Sri Lankan airport by the law enforcement authorities on their return,? he added.? ?
"If they wish to return to Sri Lanka voluntarily, Sri Lanka would welcome their return"
Official from the Ministry?of Foreign Affairs?
According to the information received by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs from the Australian Department of Immigration and Border Protection, through the High Commission in Canberra, there were 21 Sri Lankan nationals on Manus Island as of 12 November.? ?
An official from the Ministry, who didn?t wish to be named, said that those recognized as refugees, can settle in Papua New Guinea, as per the arrangement between the Australians and PNG Governments. ?Alternatively, refugees who don?t wish to resettle in PNG can apply for resettlement in the US or apply to move to Nauru,? he said.? ?
Those who have failed to be recognized as asylum seekers or refugees are required to return to their country of origin, and the Governments of PNG and Australia will facilitate voluntary returns, he said.? ?
?The Government of Sri Lanka can?t force anyone to return. If they wish to return to Sri Lanka voluntarily, however, they can do so , and Sri Lanka would welcome their return,? the official from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said.?
?
"Govt. will bear the cost of air tickets of returnees"
Tilak Marapana- Minister?of Foreign Affairs
The Minister of Foreign Affairs Tilak Marapana told Parliament that Sri Lankan refugees held in Australian detention centres for attempting to illegally enter Australia would be brought back to Sri Lanka.
He said that steps will be taken for the Government to bear the cost of the air tickets of the returnees. He revealed that there were 197 Sri Lankans who are held at various refugee centers in PNG, Nauru, Christmas Island etc.? ?
?
?
?
"Refugees have a fundamental human right to seek freedom"
A community worker?in?contactwith refugees on Manus Island
A community worker, in contact with refugees on Manus Island, who requested anonymity, said that more than 70% of those in the detention centre have been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). ?Some refugees have untreated physical war injuries,? she said. She said that the lack of resettlement options was the main grievance of these refugees. ?They want freedom in a durable third country to re-build their lives. UNHCR has previously said that PNG isn?t a durable resettlement country,? she said. She stressed that people have been there for far too long and should be resettled quickly.? ?
?The majority have been found to meet the criteria and have been determined to be refugees. They are refugees and have a fundamental human right to seek freedom and the opportunity to re-build their lives,? she said.? ?
According to her until the shutdown of the detention centre people had to line up for food like in a prison. ?Services slowly improved with English classes, excursions, one or two equipment in the gym,? she said.?
"there is new, clean, safe alternative accommodation available to the refugees and asylum seekers"
Response from the Australian Government?
? ?In response to the escalating media reports, the Australian Government categorically rejected the claims that there was a ?humanitarian emergency? on Manus Island. ?Refugees and failed asylum seekers staying at the RPC-site are making an informed choice to do so, and have been provided with information and assurances from the PNG Government that facilities are ready at alternative locations,? the Australian Government said in a statement.? ?
The statement said that there was new, clean, safe alternative accommodation available to the refugees and asylum seekers.? ?
As the PNG authorities formally closed the Manus RPC on 31 October the Department?s staff no longer had authority to remain on PNG?s Lombrum Naval Base and departed, the statement said.? ?
?The PNG Supreme Court has refused legal applications to reopen and restore services at the former RPC. It?s important to note that the Court was ?satisfied? that the Government of PNG has provided suitable alternative accommodation that allows for free movement and which is of good standard and sufficient for their daily needs,? the statement further said.?
The Government also said that around 150 refugees and failed asylum seekers have moved in to the alternative a ccommodation sites.??
