Allianz Arogya, critical illness cover with savings component now in Sri Lanka
	
For the first time in Sri Lanka, sufferers of number of critical illnesses will have the financial relief they seek, to undergo essential medical care. Allianz Arogya, an insurance policy coupled with a Life cover and savings component to help towards meeting the prohibitive cost of critical illness, is now introduced by Allianz Lanka to meet a long-felt market need.
Allianz Arogya provides financial relief during three stages of critical illness, depending on the severity of the illness: during the minor stage at early diagnosis when preventive measures are possible, during its major stage if and when the disease progresses, and at its critical stage, if and when it is diagnosed as being terminal. Critical accidents are also covered, and one child for every policyholder can be included in the policy as well. The day- to- day costs of hospitalisation are also met.
Allianz Arogya covers common illnesses like cancer, heart attacks, strokes and kidney failure. Ministry of Health, Sri Lanka, statistics confirm that cancer caused more than 14,000 deaths in the country in 2013, and records in 2014 indicate that over 26,000 patients have been diagnosed with the disease during that year. Breast, cervix and thyroid cancers are the most common among females, while oral, lung and larynx cancers are common among males.
Similarly, Ischemic heart disease was the leading cause of death in 2012 and killed about 33.000 sufferers, followed by stroke, which felled over 15,000 (Source: WHO).
We considered these statistics and evaluated the existing market offerings, said Ruchira Perera, Senior Manager, Life, Allianz Lanka Ltd. What is presently available in the market for critical illnesses is an add-on attached to Life insurance policy, which pay out a flat sum assured. So we came up with a more transparent, flexible and comprehensive product designed to give our customers the financial support for an early recovery from a life-altering illness. Also, because Allianz Arogya has been designed with a savings component, the insured receives a lump sum at the end of the policy, which is over and above the critical illness claims.
Since inception ten years ago, Allianz Lanka has continued to introduce many new and innovative products to the Sri Lankan market; Universal Life is a case in point. Allianz Arogya is the latest addition to an impressive array of products designed to provide customers with the best possible financial care to support them during difficult times in their lives.

EC speaks of possibility of holding LG polls this year
	
The Local Government elections could be held later this year if the Delimitation Committee completes its work and gazette the wards by August this year, Elections Commission Chairman Mahinda Deshapriya said today.
He told a media briefing that the local government election could be held in one-and-a-half months to two-months time if the gazette notice on the delimitation was issued in August this year. He said the committee had assured that it would do its utmost to complete its work by then.
There is no delay in the part of the Elections Commission as it is ready to hold the election at any time," Mr. Deshapriya said.
Responding to a question asked by a journalist as to whether it was possible to hold the elections to local bodies which did not have any delimitation issued, Mr. Deshapriya said he had requested the delimitation committee to send him a list of such local bodies but the committee had not sent him the list yet. "I will publish the list once I get them," he said.
Mr. Deshapriya said several political parties had wanted amendments to the Local Government Elections Act reducing the five per cent cut-off point. He said the new Act applies the five percent cut-off point to each newly created ward. (Yohan Perera)

Australian businessman Brian Shaddick is to fly to Colombo to attend court proceedings in the case in which opposition MP Udaya Gammanpila is charged with the sale by fraudulent means 4.1 million Pan Asia Bank shares valued at Rs.110 million belonging to Mr. Shaddick.
Mr. Gammanpila was arrested by the Police Special Investigation Unit (SIU) on charges of having used a fraudulent a Power of Attorney said to have been issued by Mr. Shaddick to sell the shares held by the Australia Lanka Holdings Company headed by the Australian businessman at a time when Mr. Gammanpila was the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of the company.
Brian Shaddick joined a media conference held yesterday at the Colombo National Library Auditorium via Skype.
The media conference was organized by Lasitha Perera who holds Mr. Shaddick's the Power of Attorney in Sri Lanka.
He told the media that though he had made every effort to take legal action against Mr. Gammanpila had failed because of Mr. Gammanpila's political support.
Mr. Shaddick alleged that he was threatened by a son of Sydney Jayasinghe, who was a Joint Managing Director of Australia Lanka Holdings Company.
Sydney Jayasinghe was also remanded along with Mr. Gammanpila in connection with this case.
Mr. Shaddick said he left the country in the wake of death threats and decided to take legal action against Mr. Jayasinghe and Mr. Gammanpila.
While denying claims of a political revenge, Mr. Shaddick said Sri Lankan politics has nothing to do with his personal matters.
He reiterated that he was not influenced by any government politician when it came to taking legal action against Mr. Gammanpila.
He should be ashamed for what he has done, using a fraudulent Power of Attorney on my behalf. I never gave him the authority to intervene in my legal powers, Mr. Shaddick alleged.
His wife, Elizabeth Janet Shaddick also spoke.
The only thing about politics in this matter is the free and fair atmosphere where anyone can seek justice in Sri Lanka which has been created by the current government. We are thankful to it, Ms. Shaddick said.
Meanwhile, Mr. Perera said there were two more cases which were being investigated by the SIU on complaints lodged by him against Mr. Gammanpila.
He said they were hopeful that the two other cases would also be taken up for prosecution once the investigations are concluded. (Piyumi Fonseka)

This is also significantly the highest number of claims recorded to date in the industry, and is a testament to Janashakthis financial stability as well as an indication of the companys steadfast commitment to its stakeholders.
The recent floods which devastated 22 districts is considered as one of the worst natural disasters to impact the Indian Ocean region since the 2004 tsunami. *It displaced 350,000 people, destroyed 502 buildings, and caused 92 fatalities. The disaster did not discriminate targeting rural and urban families alike, and even left some families with nothing to return to after the waters subsided.
Taking the large scale damage into account, Janashakthi deployed additional teams around the island to expedite the processing and settlement of claims in a quick and
efficient manner.
The floods in May were one of the most devastating natural disasters the country has faced in recent times. Monitoring on ground developments closely, our teams were on standby to assist our policyholders and the affected communities at large. We rose to the cause swiftly by expediting the processing of intimated claims in a rapid and efficient manner. As an Insurance provider that promises protection and a safety net to our customers in the event of unforeseen circumstances, we understand that it is our duty to offer peace of mind and a solid footing to enable them to resume their lives.

Going beyond the settlement of claims, Janashakthi additionally provided vehicle breakdown assistance to all those affected by the floods, by towing their vehicles free of charge to the nearest garage, and offering advice on protecting vehicles from further damage, irrespective of whether they were Janashakthi insured or not.
True to its ethos of working together as a united Janashakthi family, the company also extended all necessary assistance to members of staff who were affected. Teams of Janashakthi volunteers also rallied together to reach out to the communities they operate in, by distributing relief material to those affected.

Lankan allegedly attacked in Canada due to race
	
Toronto police are investigating after a Sri Lankan man said he was followed by two men on his way home from a night shift Sunday morning and had assaulted him inside Union Station in Toronto, Canada CBC News reported on Sunday.
A new permanent resident, Suresh Ommi had immigrated to Canada via India and has been in Toronto for only one month.
According to Ommi, he was waiting at a streetcar stop on Queens Quay on Sunday when he saw two men on bikes watching him intently from across the road.
"They just stopped at that point exactly, that point opposite to me. One guy made a hand gesture, something like a handgun, and he wants to like shoot me," Ommi told CBC News.
He said he tried not to pay them any attention but then one of them eventually approached him.
"He came towards me, he got off the bike and came right in front of my face and he said, 'You  Sri Lankan, go back to your country.'"
Ommi said the man, who he estimates to be around 20 years old, followed his streetcar to the Union Station.
"I was going to the TTC staff for help and he kicked me in the back. This is something I never expected. Canada is one of the safest countries in the whole world. I never expected this kind of racial slur," he continued.
Toronto police has told CBC News they are investigating the alleged assault and will be looking to review any surveillance footage that may have captured it.
"These allegations, especially when there's a racially motivated slant to it, we definitely take them very seriously. It would be investigated thoroughly either way, but we do tend to give extra priority to this because it was possibly racially motivated," police said.

Savants statues to be shipped to Sri Lanka
	
Sixteen impressive statues of the Tamil savant Thiruvalluvar, made in Chennai, will be shipped to Colombo to be installed in 13 schools and 3 colleges in the island nation this week.
The nearly 6.5 foot high statues made of fiberglass depict the sage sitting on an adhara peedam (pedestal) 1.75 foot high.
They would be shipped to Colombo on Tuesday to be installed at 16 locations.
Our gift to Sri Lanka will help to further strengthen relations between Indian and Lanka. This will also highlight the importance of Tamil (language) and Thiruvalluvars Thirukkural in short and sweet lines, says V.G.P. Santhosam, chairman of VGP group of companies and founder of VGP Ulaga Tamil Sangam on Sunday. The VGP Ulaga Tamil Sangam is the donor of the statues.
These statues would be installed in the Tamil dominated areas like Savagachery, Kilinochi, Mullai Island, Mannar, Puliyangulam, Thirukonamalai, Puttalam, Mattakkalapu, Mattalai, Kalmunai, Kambaga, Navalpitti, Theraniyakal, Attan, Pandaravalai and Erakuvalai.
The VGP Ulaga Tamil Sangam, which has a tradition of providing Valluvar statues to various countries, immediately accepted a proposal and got the statues done, Mr Santhosam said and lauded the efforts of Sri Lankas education minister V.S. Radhakrishnan and Sri Lankas coordinator K. Sachidanandam for their efforts in this direction. Speaking to DC, Janikaraman, sculptor said the statues could withstand the vagaries of nature. It took nearly two months to make the statues. We decided to make the conventionally accepted sitting posture of the sage, he added.
All the statues were displayed before the secretary of Sri Lanka education department Tissa Hewavitharana and Sri Lanka Deputy High Commissioner V. Krishnamoorthy at Sathya Studios in the city on Sunday. Acknowledging Mr Santhosams gesture, Mr Tissa said the gift of 16 statues of sage Thiruvalluvar to Sri Lanka was a matter of pride and privilege to the people of Lanka.
The Thirukkural has been translated into 62 languages of the world including your neighbouring language Sinhalese. The people of Tamil Nadu should be proud to hear that there are three translations of Thirukkural in Sinhalese, Mr Tissa said. This effort would go a long way in further strengthening the cultural cooperation between the two countries, said Mr. Krishnamoorthy. (Deccan Chronicle)

Will cut my throat if there's evidence that I robbed even one dollar: MR
	
Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, who was on a visit to Japan, said at an interview that he would cut his throat if there was evidence to implicate him in the stealing of public funds.
Responding to a question during an interview with the Japan Times about corruption allegations, he said, They allege that I have stolen $18 billion, but if they find evidence of even $1, I will cut my throat.
When asked about future plans, Mr. Rajapaksa said he was barred from seeking a third term as president, but flashing his signature smile, he did not rule out running for prime minister. Politicians never retire, he said.
The Japan Times report follows:
Former Sri Lankan President Mahinda Rajapaksa, who was commander-in-chief during the last stage of the war, is unapologetic about the consequences. He recently told me that it was war and thus victory was essential, an outcome that he says was widely desired and welcomed by the public. Asked how he reconciled being a devout Buddhist and commander-in-chief, he argued that his goal was peace.
In his view, Tiger leader Prabhakaran misjudged the situation, hoping that international pressure in response to the carnage would force the state to back off. Prabhakaran, in Rajapaksas view, was too full of himself, failing to understand that this time the state had no intention of allowing the Tigers to regroup.
Although Rajapaksa eradicated terrorism and raised living standards, he lost the 2015 elections. He attributes his defeat to resentment against him from Muslims (9.7 percent of the population, according to a 2012 census) and Sri Lankan and Indian Tamils (15.2 percent), and to the Sinhalese harboring unrealistic expectations who took what he delivered for granted.
Asked if he had any regrets, Rajapaksa says he trusted people too much. Regarding the scars of war in this traumatized nation, he says that he has promoted reconciliation by returning land to the Tamils and investing heavily in infrastructure and development projects in the northeast, helping them to begin restoring their lives after three decades of war. Asked why the Sri Lankan Navy is operating luxury resorts on unreturned land, he says it is important to give them something to do.
It is easy to understand why Rajapaksa is described as the affable authoritarian, exuding bonhomie and a steely will. He artfully parries awkward questions about the need for justice and accountability for war crimes. In his view, there is no need for an international tribunal because Sri Lanka has the judicial expertise to conduct its own reckoning. When I pointed out that President Maithripala Sirisena has yet to follow through on his pledge to establish a truth and reconciliation commission, Rajapaksa says that starting this process was his idea, having sent a mission to learn lessons from South Africas experience, but the international community opposed this initiative. Pressed to explain what he would do to promote future reconciliation, Rajapaksa offered no vision for healing the wounds other than stressing that the priority should be on promoting economic development and raising living standards.
Regarding Asian leaders, he admires authoritarians such as Singapores founding prime minister, Lee Kuan Yew, and former Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, who both boosted the economies of their nations. But he is more skeptical about Myanmar State Counselor Aung San Suu Kyi, another devout Buddhist leader presiding over a country troubled by endemic inter-ethnic conflict and religious tensions. I drew attention to her desire to attain freedom from fear, and how Sri Lankas lingering culture of war makes this goal elusive. He agreed it made sense in theory, but expressed uncertainty about how to proceed, adding that now she faces the burden of delivering on her promises.
He stopped short of condemning Sri Lankas militant monks and extremist Buddhist organizations for advocating and engaging in violence targeting Muslims, but did say that it is not consistent with public sentiments.
Asked about continued abductions and the silencing of critics by state forces, Rajapaksa maintained that this is no longer the case.

Has press freedom improved under his successor Rajapaksa doesnt think so, saying the media is controlled by the government and is subject to various threats. He also brushes aside accusations about the murder and disappearance of journalists on his watch. When asked about a journalist whose posthumous final column implicated Rajapaksa in his anticipated murder, he points out that in parliament Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, his political rival, accused a prominent ex-general of ordering the hit.
Twelve thousand Tigers were released from detention without trial, says Rajapaksa, adding that there are no more political prisoners in Sri Lanka except for him and his family, who are subject to harassment by the media and government. He bitterly complained about his sons arrest, and that he has not been allocated an official bungalow  a privilege extended to other ex-presidents.
And corruption allegations They say I have stolen $18 billion, but if they find evidence of even $1, I will cut my throat, he says, claiming that evidence has come out implicating the current president.
Asked about future plans, Rajapaksa pointed out that now he is barred from seeking a third term as president, but, flashing his signature smile, did not rule out running for prime minister. Politicians never retire, he says.
