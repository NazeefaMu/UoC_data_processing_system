Video: Surprising that confusions on CEPA aren?t clarified: HC Sinha
	
Indian High Commissioner Y.K. Sinha today expressed his surprise at the lack of efforts to clear the misinformation and misimpressions that have been disseminated on the CEPA (Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement) that have been in the works for several years but yet remain to be signed by the two countries.
Speaking at the Annual Research Symposium 2015 held at the Colombo University this morning, the Indian High Commissioner pointed to the fact that although CEPA was drafted with a plan of promoting greater interaction economically and commercially, the misinformation that has been circulated with regard to the clauses in the draft agreement has shed a negative light on it.
Mr. Sinha said he was amused to read some of the reports that have been surfacing even recently on CEPA that have shed an unconstructive light on the agreement. ?
?They state a large number of Indians would come to Sri Lanka including barbers, lawyers and professors even and that they would take over Sri Lanka . . . These claims are amusing and completely untrue,? he said.
?What surprises me the most is that there is no empirical research to lay the proper facts before the people here,? he said. ?
He then referred to a recent print media report that referred to the UNHRC resolution on Sri Lanka and the accountability mechanism - which quoting a political leader- had stated that if the UN resolution was allowed to be implemented, Indian lawyers would arrive in Sri Lanka and commence their practices in the country.
?It is puzzling as to how Indian lawyers came into the picture,? the High Commissioner said while pointing out that they are the results of misinformation and highlighted further on the importance of clarifying such erroneous reports. ?
Moving back to the CEPA that is yet to be signed between Sri Lanka and India, HC Sinha noted that despite the misinformation, the drafts negotiated between the two governments that remain to be signed, only referred to two areas where Sri Lanka would open up to Indian professionals; computer and computer related services and marine sector ? specifically the ship repair sector.
?All this while India would open up 20 professions initially to Sri Lanka and expand later,? he added. (Lakna Paranamanna)

Lack of funds of RDA holds up Marine Drive extension
	
The third phase of the Marine Drive extension project which commenced in 1995 is at a standstill due to the lack of funds, the Road Development Authority (RDA) said today.
The authority said that it found a number of houses and business institutions along the street lines of the project to extend the Marine Drive from Kollupitiya to Galle Face.
?
Officials said that even though they had negotiated with land owners and were ready to pay compensation in accordance with the value of the land, the lack of funds had brought the project to a standstill.
?The extended Marine Drive would end at the Galle Face Green in the Galle Face Hotel area and then would be connected to the Galle Road at the Galle Face roundabout. In fact, we have found a considerable number of buildings that need to be removed for the construction of the road. But, the land values at well over one million a perch are very high in those areas. Residents asking for more compensation makes the problem worse,? the official said.
Earlier, the RDA had ruled that they can pay residents compensation only after the properties had been evaluated and that the residents would have to find alternative housing elsewhere after compensation is paid.
The entire Marine Drive project is being supervised by the RDA together with Colombo Municipal Council. Attempts to contact CMC officials for a comment failed. (Piyumi Fonseka)
