Civilians killed in war can be remembered: Rajitha
	
If the JVP commemorates its members died fighting the Police and the Armed Forces at two terror campaigns in 1971 and 1989 ? 90 period, no one must have any ill-will or resent, when parents of those who died at war in the North?East did the same, Cabinet Spokesman Health Minister Dr Rajitha Senaratne said.
He added that not only the LTTE but the JVP also fell in the category of terrorists because the LTTE launched a civil war to divide the county and establish Eelam and the JVP tried to topple the democratically elected Governments.
In response to the media at the weekly Cabinet news briefing at the Information Department Auditorium yesterday, Minister Senaratne asked whether it was wrong when the parent and relatives of war dead to engage in religious activities to commemorate their loved ones, who died in the war.
The dialogue between the media that ensued during the news briefing is as follows:
Journalist: Are you saying that the JVP also was a terrorist organization during their campaign against the Government, like the LTTE?
Minister Senaratne: Absolutely, because both, the LTTE and the JVP had launched a civil war in the country and both were terrorists in their actions.
Journalist: Does the Government permit to hold Maveerar Day on May 18 and 19 in the North-East?
Minister Senaratne: The Government permits only to commemorate civilians, who became war victims by their families and relatives.
Journalist: That insinuates that civilians died during the conflict.
Minister Senaratne: Yes, of course. Civilians of both sides died in the war.
Journalist: But the Sri Lankan Government maintains that there were no civilian casualties at the final phase of the war.
Minister Senaratne: That is the most unrealistic comment on the civil war in Sri Lanka. Can any right-thinking person say that there were zero casualties at the humanitarian operation?
Journalist: Are you saying that armed forces deliberately targeted civilians at the humanitarian operation?
Minister Senaratne: Not at all! What I am saying is that it is impossible to prevent collateral damage in any armed conflict. We became a laughing stock when we said there were zero casualties at the final stage of the war. This claim of Zero Casualties seriously affected the credibility of Sri Lanka. Whether it was a war waged by Dharmasoka or Alexander the Great, preventing collateral damage is impossible. That is the nature of the war. We cannot blame any side of the divide for civilian casualties but the war itself.
Journalist: Should our armed forces take responsibility for civilian casualties if any.
Minister Senaratne: Absolutely not. Don?t forget that it was a separatist war waged against a democratically elected Government. The LTTE terror campaign also challenged the territorial integrity and sovereignty of the country. Therefore, our armed forces did not have any other option but to crush the terror campaign using its full might. In that endeavour, they never targeted civilians but militants. Therefore, no one can blame our armed forces. Did the US and the EU killed only IS and other Middle East terrorists in Syria, Iraq, Libya or Afghanistan when they bombed those countries?
Journalist: Does the Government commemorate war heroes this year?
Minister Senaratne: Yes, at the Parliament grounds on Saturday.
Journalist: Does the Army prevent if there were ceremonies to commemorate dead LTTE cadres?
Minister Senaratne: Commemorating dead terrorists is against the law of the land. But there is no problem in commemorating dead civilians.
A journalist from Military Spokesman, Brigadier Sumith Atapattu:
What do you have to say about this?
Brigadier Atapattu: No comments.

Deaths of two British rugby players: Police probe drug use
	
Police are investigating whether drugs contributed to the death of two British rugby players after a visit to a nightclub in Colombo.
A source said that 27-year-old Thomas Baty, who died on Tuesday (15), had given a statement while he was undergoing treatment at the hospital, stating that they had consumed brown sugar drugs.
British rugby player Thomas Howard (26) passed away while undergoing treatment at the hospital on Sunday (13) after complaining of breathing difficulties.
Earlier, the post-mortem tests on the body of Thomas Howard Andrew returned an open verdict. However, his body had subsequently been referred to the government analyst for further examination. The post-mortem examination into Thomas Baty was conducted yesterday and his tissue and blood samples had also been referred to the government analyst for further tests.
The sources said they were looking at whether drugs were involved and if they had caused the deaths of the ruggerites while the source of these drugs, if any, was also under investigation.
Both players who were members of a visiting rugby team from Durham in northeast England, that arrived in Sri Lanka on May 10 to play two friendlies, the first of which was played in Colombo on Saturday (12). They were staying at a hotel in Colombo.(Darshana Sanjeewa)

## Title: From art to kitsch

From art to kitsch
	
In his landmark essay ?Avant-Garde and Kitsch?, Clement Greenberg discusses the evolution of art in terms of its separation into two broad cultures; the highbrow and the popular. The progression or regression (depending on how you see it) from the one to the other was facilitated by the transition from feudalism to industrial capitalism, through which universal literacy was achieved to such an extent that those masses became the shapers and makers of various art forms. Greenberg, who was a painter and an art critic himself, contends that this transition occurs owing to the tendency of a society to start unravelling itself once the religious, cultural, and various other morals and absolutes on which it is based begin to be questioned rather critically. By this, ?one and the same civilisation produces simultaneously two such different things? ? the high and the low.?
While the essay has been discredited since, and scholars have pointed out certain inconsistencies therein, I am interested in some of Greenberg?s ideas because they pinpoint the bifurcation of aesthetics which we, in Sri Lanka, have been witnessing. The evolution of art, for Greenberg that is, follows two broad routes; from art (the academic, scholarly, upper class type, based on refined, sophisticated tastes) to avant-garde (the bohemian type, which separates art from the necessity of patrons and financiers) to its rear-guard, referred to as ?kitsch? (a German word connoting the seamless fusion of commerce and art in modern, urban, industrial societies). Art and kitsch, highbrow and lowbrow, refined and vulgar; these are the terms we use to differentiate between these two aesthetic sensibilities, to an extent in Sri Lanka too. How can we apply Greenberg?s contentions, minus their flaws, to what transpired in this country, then? By considering the way the transition from the highbrow to the popular corresponded to the evolution of the kind of audience which, in here or elsewhere, pandered to these cultural forms.
?It follows that if there was no real bohemian culture in Sri Lanka, there was no intermediate stage between art and kitsch, or between the highbrow and the popular
Advent of archaeology
Perhaps what needs to be borne in mind before examining the applicability of this cultural phenomenon to Sri Lanka is that in Sri Lanka, there was, historically, no real bohemian culture. Bohemians were wanderers, vagrants, uncommitted rebels, who simultaneously distanced themselves from and attached themselves to the bourgeois lifestyles they vowed to get away from and repudiate. In here though, the separation was between the coloniser and his subjects, namely, the vast majority of the countrymen. For the latter, art was neither highbrow nor kitsch; it was purely a means of communicating within themselves. Even the Gal Viharaya at Polonnaruwa, as Regi Siriwardena once pointed out in an essay, was built with a utilitarian objective, since worship was as vital to the people of those days as going to a job is to us today. While art did exist, very little of it was consumed as objects of refinement to be studied from afar; there was, in other words, no proper extrinsic value to the artefacts we hold up and admire in museums today, only an intrinsic plasticity. With the advent of archaeology and restoration, traditional art forms became something to preserve. The champions of this mode of thinking were the born-again natives from the Anglican elite, like Devar Surya Sena.
Greenberg traces the aesthetic route from art to avant-garde, and at the hands of the bohemians, avant-garde reaches its peak. It follows that if there was no real bohemian culture in Sri Lanka, there was no intermediate stage between art and kitsch, or between the highbrow and the popular. In the Bengali Renaissance, particularly the novels of Bankim Chatterjee, we see the fusion of the West and East, which unearths a culture that can be at least vaguely referred to as avant-garde. Greenberg?s thesis is that such a culture thrives on a self-referential sensibility. According to him, the avant-garde artists ?derive their chief inspiration from the medium they work in?, which means that what is central to the work of, say, a Chatterjee novel or a Picasso painting is its preoccupation with its forms and techniques: it returns to its own workings and externalises those workings in every line, shape, and contour. If these indeed were the hallmarks of the avant-garde, bohemian sensibility, then we cannot claim that we reached that intermediate stage.
The transition from art to avant-garde is really the transition of one order to another. But the transition from avant-garde to kitsch is a reflection of changing landscapes and industrialisation. Colonial societies did not escape this wave of industrialisation, though they were asked to pay the price for European progress by handing over their resources at dirt cheap prices. Sarlis, the painter, who depicted moments and excerpts from the lives of the Buddhas, was Sri Lanka?s equivalent of Ravi Varma; the painters of spirituality on carpets and temple walls and tapestries, through whom the faith of the majority became intertwined with the walls of their houses. This is the fusion at the heart of kitsch, and in such a fusion we come across (as Tissa Abeysekara noted in an essay written on Lester James Peries) a pseudo-renaissance. But for the kitsch culture in Sri Lanka to unfold itself, it had to wait until three distinct epochs had passed: 1931, 1948, and 1956.
Universal literacy?
Art and avant-garde turn to kitsch the moment the masses, the majority, are empowered to be the shapers and makers of the culture of their society. Kitsch is a product of the industrial revolution, even in societies which experience that revolution second hand and (as with us) have never gone beyond the landowning aristocracy that the coloniser selected, tutored, and in effect bred. Emancipation, in a metaphoric sense, was what the masses demanded, from the shackles of colonialism or at least the culture of illiteracy colonialism necessitated in their societies. In the West, industrialisation was followed by the establishment of what was called universal literacy. In Sri Lanka and India, literacy, though hardly obtainable (as Will Durrant has written, the British India Government spent eight cents per head per year on education at a time when they were spending 83 on the army), congealed into demands for the franchise, which we got in 1931. If literacy was the prerequisite for kitsch in the West, it was the prerequisite for freedom in our societies. But the franchise in itself was not enough; what was needed was independence (formally) and a complete if not partial moving away from the policies of the British Government. The former, of course, we got in 1948, and the latter we got in 1956.
The majority needed to be assimilated to the societies had been estranged from, but the minute they aspired to be the shapers of their collective destinies, a fatal rupture resulted between two forms of culture: the formal and the folk. This process was necessitated more or less by the rural-urban exodus which the franchise, independence, and the historical eventuality compelled by 1956, free education, resulted in. As Greenberg notes, ?the peasants who settled in the cities as proletariat and petty bourgeois learned to read and write for the sake of efficiency.? But the formal culture they aspired to reach required tremendous reserves of leisure and privilege. The peasants simply could not afford that kind of leisure. Having been assimilated to the city, they could not return to the village either, because they had forsaken on their earlier way of life. As such, the ?new urban masses? set up a pressure on the societies they were moved to, to provide them with a catalogue of art forms which they could enjoy. Subsequently it was this petty bourgeoisie which enabled the opening up of our art forms to outside (mainly Indian and Western) influences. On one hand, they enjoyed Sunil Shantha, Amaradeva, and Victor Ratnayake. On the other hand, they enjoyed baila, Rukmani Devi, and Clarence Wijewardena.
Greenberg notes, ?the peasants who settled in the cities as proletariat and petty bourgeois learned to read and write for the sake of efficiency?
The fatal rupture ? between folk and formal ? caused by this social phenomenon was an inevitable consequence of the social mobility resulting from universal literacy (in the form of free education). Moreover, between Amaradeva and Clarence there was and is, to a certain extent, a separation, which while not unbridgeable remains, by default, distinct from one another. If we are to follow Greenberg and impute terms to these two streams of one sensibility, then we have to demarcate them as ?jana? (highbrow) and ?janapriya? (lowbrow). In both instances what was wiped out, or belittled, was the indigenous culture; the same culture which survives today, though barely, through the joint efforts of Sahan Ranwala and the Ranwala Balakaya as well as its followers and students (some of whom, like Chanuka Moragoda, have graduated to the janapriya sensibility through YouTube and other channels in social media). Obviously, one essay isn?t enough to dwell on the problems that this particular rupture has caused within our cultural firmament. Examining a problem presupposes a succinct explication of that problem. Before examining it, therefore, I will lay it down as follows. The fact is that while the janapriya culture has evolved, and continues to evolve today, from baila on your radio to Sanuka Wickramasinghe on YouTube, the jana culture, which includes among its vast canon Amaradeva and Premasiri Khemadasa, has stopped somewhere. Now that I?ve laid down the problem, I?ll examine it next week. For now however, I?m done with laying it down.

Gota and the existentialist threat he poses
	
?
Colombo, or rather certain powdered, lipsticked and groomed part of the political space it is taken to be, is uneasy. The unease of those who?ve seldom experienced anything but ease comes from a spectre that has haunted them for quite a while but has, since last Sunday (May 14th) become too flesh-and-blood-real for comfort. In a word (or name), Gota. That?s Gotabhaya Rajapaksa.?
?
They might think that Gota trespassed, for prime properties in Colombo are not exactly considered the ?home turf? of anyone who has roots elsewhere and moreover is not seen by masses as having roots in Colombo. They even believed that Galle Face Green was theirs and thought the Joint Opposition doesn?t have the support needed to fill it on a May Day. One year later, the Kolombians, if you will, have essentially conceded that they don?t have the numbers.? ?
?
A shocked Kolombian community has already indulged in fear-mongering. They talk of imminent dictatorship
?
Galle Face Green, however is ?public? and not considered Kolombian; it doesn?t really have the exclusivity flavour that, say, the Colombo Golf Club is endowed with. Shangri-La is different. That?s what hurts, obviously.? ?
On Sunday Gota, who is speculated to be a presidential candidate, unveiled ?Vision 2030? for Sri Lanka, a policy statement and a manifesto if ever there was one.? ?
A shocked Kolombian community has already indulged in fear-mongering. They talk of imminent dictatorship. The more politically aware sections of the Kolombians are careful enough to interject that the present regime is marked by the lack of a programme, absence of political will and incompetency. They don?t talk of the nepotism, embezzlement of public funds, abuse of state resources, wastage and all those other things they accused the previous regime of.? ?
?
On Sunday Gota, who is speculated to be a presidential candidate, unveiled ?Vision 2030? for Sri Lanka, a policy statement and a manifesto if ever there was one
?
It?s understandable. It was never about cleaning up; it was always a case of having ?our people running things?. It would be interesting to revisit ?the case for regime change? that was made back in late 2014. Here?s a common enough conversation:??
?We need change, man!???
?Do you think those who stood with the Rajapaksas or who did Rajapaksa-like things when they were in power can bring about change????
A few moments of silence and then this: ?True, but first things first, this lot is bad and we need to get rid of them first!???
That same logic can be applied to any critical political moment, but it is always selectively applied. Understandable because integrity is not the strongest suit and anyway it was never about theft, mismanagement and being dictatorial. If there are doubts about dictatorship-credentials among the preferred candidate of the Kolombians, that?s Ranil Wickremesinghe, then a close look at the party history, party constitution and relevant political machinations pertaining to the United National Party (UNP) would help dispel them. Add complicity in and deafening silence on the 88-89 ?bheeshanaya? and you get the picture.? ?
The ?dictator? story is not politically innocent. The 1978 constitution was made to make dictators out of those who were elected President. The 19th Amendment did little to take away the dictatorial powers. Anyway, if Gota?s track record makes such fears legitimate, then so does Ranil?s and most certainly the Kolombians preferred presidential choice in 2010, Sarath Fonseka.? ?
It is therefore not about fearing what Gota might do to democracy, for such things were never the concern of the Kolombians who used the related words as and when convenient and dropped them as easily when they became inconvenient.??
?
It is therefore not about fearing what Gota might do to democracy, for such things were never the concern of the Kolombians who used the related words as and when convenient and dropped them as easily when they became inconvenient
Here?s a paragraph from something I wrote in December 2017 (?So who is afraid of Gotabhaya and why?) when Colombo was hit by a spate of anti-Gota posters:??
?There?s another ?fear-element? here. Fear of the man, not for the kind of thuggery he may unleash on the country, but the existentialist threat to those currently in power. In attacking Gota, the attackers (obviously those currently in power) betray a strong sense of unease. If Gota was not a threat, then why bother??? ?
Here are some facts worth reflecting on. a) We have moved from Family Rule to Royal Family Rule, b) this lot kicked good governance in the teeth less than a week after disposing of Mahinda Rajapaksa, c) it took these people less than two months to rob the Central Bank, d) this government is moving heaven and earth to defend the corrupt judicial system, going to the extent of harassing the one man who has stood up and pointed out the system?s many flaws, Nagananda Kodituwakku, d) this government baton charges, splits skulls and squashes protests the same way the Rajapaksas did but very much earlier into its term comparatively, e) this government has made a mockery of constitutional reform and reconciliation, f) this government has not got into white-vanning mode (yet) but the big bosses aren?t at all uncomfortable with the phenomenon, only back then they used the term ?vigilantes? (kalu balallu, kaha balallu, ukusso, People?s Revolutionary Red Army or PRAA, etc etc).? ?
Does this make Gota a legitimate choice? Well, If he?s as bad as anyone, then he is also as good as anyone. The anxieties of the Kolombians don?t make me lose any sleep, but the key question here is are we so poor, politically, that we can?t think outside of various sections of the ruling class (yes, there are non-Kolombians in it too).? ?
??We need a strong man? is a call for a pied-piper. If ?strength? was all that was needed, then Mr. Sri Lanka would be good enough. A visionary? Not necessarily. JR had ?vision? didn?t he, and didn?t he orchestrate things to push the country to the bloodbath it suffered at the end of the eighties?? ?
There?s a criteria that is being ignored: untainted. This then is a call for supporting two people who are being ignored by the mainstream media for the most part: Naganand Kodituwakku and Rohan Pallewatte. ?Gota? and his detractors are indulging in a grand distraction whether they are aware of it or not.? ?

Govt. debt up by Rs.836bn due to Rupee depreciation: PHU
	
The Government?s debt had increased by Rs. 836 bn following the depreciation of the Sri Lankan Rupee against the US Dollar during the past 40 months, Pivithuru Hela Urumaya (PHU) leader and MP Udaya Gammanpila said today.
Addressing a news briefing, he said although the government always complained that the Rajapaksa Administration caused a huge debt crisis, it was created not be anybody but the incumbent government.
?In 2014, the total government debt was Rs. 7.4 trillion. By the end of 2017, it has increased to Rs.10.3 trillion. The government should explain as to how its debt increased by 39% within such a short period without implementing any significant development project,? Gammanpila said.
?When we handed over the government to the present leaders, the dollar was trading at Rs 131. It has now rocketed up to Rs 159. The total debt has been increased by Rs 836 billions during the last 40 months due to Rupee depreciation. If the government was able to save that amount, it would have built six ports similar to Hambantota Port,? Gammanpila added.
Meanwhile, he accused that the government had been yet unable to generate 1 million job opportunities as pledged at numerous occasions.
?According to the Central Bank annual report, it was only 4,405 jobs that have been generated in the last year. But in the Rajapaksa government, we were able to generate 55,942 jobs in 2014. If this government thinks to generate 4,405 jobs per year, it will take 227 years to fulfill its goal of 1 million job opportunities,? Gammanpila said. (Sheain Fernandopulle)

Happy families will make a happy society
	
?
In the afterglow of Mother?s Day on May 13 the world this week celebrates the International Day for Families. It is widely accepted that the family is the nucleus of society, a good society depends on a good family and therefore the day is important for all.??
According to a United Nations statement, this year?s theme is ?Families and inclusive societies.? It will explore the role of families and family policies in advancing Sustainable Development Goal 16 in terms of promoting peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development.??
According to the UN, the approaches to family policies for inclusive societies vary around the world. In some regions emphasis is placed on social inclusion of various types of families and/or individuals such as migrant or indigenous families, ethnic minorities or families with persons with disabilities. In other regions primary emphasis is placed on social protection for vulnerable families to facilitate their full inclusion in the mainstream of society. As approaches vary, this year?s observance of the International Day of Families is to raise awareness of the role of families and family policies in achieving more inclusive societies from regional perspectives.??
The UN says there will be an international panel discussion which will focus on the importance of ensuring equal justice to all family members, especially women. It will also address the efforts at universal birth registration and legal identity for all, especially targeting vulnerable families. The importance of social protection for social inclusion and other aspects of socially inclusive and family-oriented policies will also be addressed.??
According to world family life expert Armando Barrientos, in developed countries the social participation and inclusion perspectives define poverty as exclusion from cooperative activity, where those in poverty are unable to take part in their communities? social life at a minimally acceptable level. In developing countries, the dominant view tends to be the ?resourcist? perspective which defines poverty as the inability of an individual or family to command sufficient resources to satisfy basic needs.? All in all, therefore, poverty can be understood as a reflection of the inability of individuals, households, families, or entire communities to attain a minimum and socially accepted standard of living measured in terms of basic consumption needs or income required to satisfy those needs. In line with this, family poverty can be described as a state in which a family earns less than a minimum amount of income?typically US$1.25 per day for a person in low-income countries?and where the insufficient income hampers the family?s ability to adequately cover basic costs of living, including paying for food, shelter, clothing, education, health care, utilities and transport.?
?
The family situation in Sri Lanka is similar to the crises in most of the developing countries. The new government when it took office in January 2015, pledged its vision would be to build a just, peaceful and all inclusive society where there would be a gradual reduction in the huge gap between the rich and the poor. Mired in political divisions and disputes the government has not been able to make much progress in taking the country towards its noble vision. We hope that in the coming 18 months especially and in the years after that, practical steps will be taken to pull thousands of families out of the mud pits of poverty into which a selfish and wicked society has put them. When we have happy and contented families only then will we have a happy, just and peaceful society based on unity in diversity.? ? ?

JVP;Rs.5.7m to refurbish toilets at Mayor's house;Rosy says toilets in dilapidated condition
	
A sum of Rs.5.7 million has been allocated for the modernisation of the toilets at the Colombo Mayor?s official residence, CMC member Sumith Passaperuma revealed at the CMC meeting held yesterday (16).
He said it was sad to witness such a waste of taxpayer's money for such a purpose when public toilets within the city were in such a unhygienic condition.
In reply, Mayor Rosy Senanayaka said she had taken a decision to revamp the toilets at her official residence as they had not been made use of for four years and were in a dilapidated condition. She also confirmed that new toilet facilities were being built around the city with private sector involvement.
Municipal Councillor Saman Abeyratne (UPFA) charged that the new mayor was behaving in a dictatorial manner and that it was not possible even for a minister to meet her without prior written appointment.
Mayor Senanayake replied that she has no time to meet all 119 members at the same time and that much of her time was devoted to holding meetings with representatives of the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank.(Jayantha Samarakone)

Mahinda, Basil, President Sirisena are decisive persons in selecting next Presidential candidate-SB
	
?
SLFP should quit Govt as soon as possible?
19A is full of ambiguities and grey areas
They should think of broader unity
Mahinda, President Sirisena should read results of Feb 10 elections properly
MP Jayampathi Wickramaratne should be held responsible as the one who drafted it
The President has understood the fact that it is difficult for the UPFA to be with the government
?
?
Former Minister S.B. Dissanayake who is now spearheading the 16-member group of the?
Sri Lanka Freedom Party responds to questions about the current political situation and the next presidential election. The excerpts of the interview:??
?
QYour group sits in the opposition now. What is the next move?
We try to get more members to our side from the government. We hope a large number of SLFPers who serve in the government at the moment will team up with us shortly.? ?
?
QNow, one SLFP section is with the opposition. There is another in the government. You all claim to be SLFPers. What is this bizarre?political situation?
The problem is even more complicated than you mentioned. There is the third section directly involved in the politics of the Joint Opposition. There are three factions. It does not augur well for the party. We are trying to unite all these factions under the banner of the party.??
?
QWhat is the first step aimed?at this?
First, we have to make sure that those serving in the government join hands with us. Secondly, we should ensure that the SLFP formally severs its links with the unity government. Thirdly, we have to bring all three factions under a common front that includes the left ?leaning, progressive and patriotic political forces which do not even have parliamentary representation.? ?
?
QWhat is the main barrier you face in ensuring the departure of SLFP from the government as?
a party?
The party has to take a decision. The SLFP Central Committee should decide it.? ?
?
QNormally, the party leader?s decision prevails on such matters. It is the same with any party. So, do you see that President Maithripala Sirisena is at a loss to take a decision?
The President has not decided when to quit the government. However, he has understood the fact that it is difficult for the United People?s Freedom Alliance (UPFA) to be with the government. Likewise, he also realized that left leaning and progressive people of this country abandoned the UPFA because of its political alignment with the UNP in the unity government.? ?
Above all, he has now understood that it is difficult for him to ensure incorruptible, democratic, transparent , accountable and harmonious governance with the UNP. He has realized that it is impossible to carry out sustainable development in the country with the UNP.? ?
It is impossible to live up to such ideals with the present UNP leadership. Be that as it may, he cannot simply decide to leave the government. He is the President. He is obliged to govern the country whoever leaves it. Earlier, the President had the power to dissolve Parliament at his will after one year. The 19th Amendment to the Constitution took that power away from him. As a result, as the President, he has to form a government, come what may, rather than seeking a fresh mandate from people at an election. Furthermore, the UNP is one among the main political forces that elected him as the President. The UNP leadership is behind him. We hope he will take the right decision at the right time after weighing the pros and cons of all these things. However, he gave us his blessings for us to sit in the opposition as members of his own party.? ?
?
QDo you fight for the opposition leader post?
We do not expect it that way. If the UPFA formally leaves the government and joins hands with the opposition, it will deserve the opposition leader post.? ?
?
QAt the SLFP Central Committee (CC) meeting due to be held today, will you insist that the party should leave the government?
We have already proposed it to the CC. I proposed it along with MP Anura Priyadarshana Yapa. We don?t expect it to be adopted today. We only intend to take decisions regarding the political reforms to the party.? ?
?
QThe President lost his power to dissolve Parliament. The 19th Amendment was incorporated into the Constitution under the blessings of the President. Do you see it as?a mistake?
It is not a mistake by the President. None of us considered it that seriously at that time. In drafting the constitutional amendment, the UNP leadership appears to have made it a point to include such a provision to the effect that Parliament cannot be dissolved for four and half years. That is to make sure that Parliament cannot be dissolved during the term of the UNP leadership as the Prime Minister. In fact, some UNPers argued that the Prime Minister could not be removed under any circumstances even through a no confidence motion. Actually, there is ambiguity in the Constitution whether the Prime Minister can be removed through such a motion or not. There are a lot of grey areas in the 19th Amendment. Those who drafted it were fully trusted by us at that time. Therefore, we did not pay attention to it.??
?
QActually, who is responsible for drafting it with such?grey areas?
Actually, it is MP Jayampathi Wickramaratne who drafted it. I learnt from another Minister that MP Wickramaratne initially drafted something even worse than that what was enacted. It appears that there is a dictatorial Prime Minister instead of a dictatorial President. It does not bode well for the country. MP Jayampathi Wickramaratne is responsible for it.? ?
?
QThere are lots of talks about the next Presidential Candidate. The President says he will not retire from politics. Who is the candidate in your mind?
The President should not retire from politics. He is the party leader. If he remains, he should contest. It is good that the UNP thinks of fielding its own candidate. The Joint Opposition considers three possible presidential candidates- Chamal Rajapaksa, Basil Rajapaksa and Gotabhaya Rajapaksa. All these are positive political developments. Yet, we all should get together and agree on?
one candidate.??
?
QWho is the best bet?
I will not mention anyone. We have to think of the persons who can get the vast majority of votes from the people.? ?
?
QWhat do you think of Gotabhaya Rajapaksa as the candidate?
Of course, he displayed his talents as the Defence Secretary at that time. He is the one who ensured unity among the three forces. The then Army Commander Minister Sarath Fonseka tried to sow discord among the three forces, actually. Only Gotabhaya Rajapaksa struck unity. In the urban development, he was efficient and delivered a whole lot of work. He has proven himself as the Defence Secretary and the head of the Urban Development Authority. Nevertheless, he antagonized the minority communities.? ?
He has attraction among the Sinhala Buddhist people, intelligentsia and the middle-class in particular. At the same time, the minority communities fear him.? ?
In the selection of the candidate, there are two decisive persons- former President Mahinda Rajapaksa and current President Maithripala Sirisena. Former Minister Basil Rajapaksa who formed the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) is also a decisive factor. I think the two leaders should consult each other and decide on the candidate. All the others will fall in line with that decision.? ?
?
QThere is a lot of antagonism between the President and the former President. Will they be able to see eye to eye as a result?
They worked as the Chairman and the General Secretary of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party for 14 years. They acted in camaraderie with each other. There is a demand from the left-wing, progressive forces in this country. None of these two leaders can act regardless of that demand. They cannot disregard people?s demand also. If they read the results of the February 10th election properly, they cannot play around with the public opinion. They have to think of a broader unity.? ?
The SLPP won the elections on February 10. However, President Sirisena emerged stronger in areas where the minority communities are concentrated. The President?s SLFP won some electoral wards in the north and the east. In our areas, we saw how the Muslims and the Tamils were rallying behind us.? ?
The election results can serve as the guiding factors for the two leaders.? ?
?
QIs there any possibility for the UNP, the SLFP and other parties to get together against SLPP at the next presidential election?
?If there is a change in the UNP leadership, such a political strategy can be contemplated. Yet, it is not certain whether such a strategy can lead to electoral success at the next election. At least, it can be considered if there is a change in the UNP leadership. The present leadership is unpopular even within the party. He faces charges related to the Central Bank bond scam. Also, the UNP leadership is responsible for the current?economic collapse.??
?
QWhat do you think of the JVP?s plan to bring the 20th Amendment to the Constitution to abolish the executive presidency?
There is nothing to talk about it. It is a private member?s bill. There are so many such motions and bills. Only a handful participates in such debates in Parliament. If there is a bill for the amendment of the Constitution, it has to be perused by the Attorney General. Then, it has to be approved by the Cabinet. It has to be endorsed by the Legal Draftsman?s Department. Afterwards, it has to be presented in Parliament. It is a?long process.? ?
Anybody can write such a motion on a piece of paper during leisure time in Parliament after meals.? ?
QThe UNP sought the Samurdhi Ministry for them this time. You are the founder of that movement. What do you think of it?
As soon as I ceased to be the subject minister in the past, the movement never lived up to its founding ideal-- poverty alleviation.? ?
?
QThe poverty level has dropped to six percent now. How applicable is the Samurdhi movement now?
I think the former government led by Mr. Mahinda Rajapaksa should be credited for it. While fighting a war, that government achieved the target. It was achieved despite that government being affected by the world economic crisis, food crisis and fuel crisis. Our economy was developed despite all that. Our GDP grew. The per capita income grew. We had increased foreign reserves.? ? ?

Man fined Rs.10, 120 for not paying Rs.30 parking fee
	
A man who failed to pay a parking fee of Rs.30 at a parking slot in Wellawatte, has been fined Rs.10,120 after a lapse of 13 days.
The man had parked his car in Wellawatte on April 25 and had forgotten to pay the fee of Rs. 30 via a machine placed near the parking place.
The person had not been aware that the payment should be done via a machine. When he found that there was nobody to collect the payment, he had departed the place without paying the fee of rs. 30 per hour.
After 13 days, he had been informed by the relevant institution over the phone that he had to pay a fine of Rs.10, 120 as he had neglected to pay the necessary amount.
The man had paid the due amount accordingly and informed the matter to the Colombo Municipal Council and the Presidential Secretariat but there has been no reaction yet. . (Dilrukshi Grero)

Meethotamulla tragedy: AG's report blames CMC
	
The Auditor General had held that the Colombo Municipal Council (CMC) was responsible for the death of 32 people and for the damage caused to properties as a result of the collapse of the Meethotamulla garbage dump in April last year.
The report of the audit carried out by the Auditor General's Department into the tragedy has said the CMC was responsible for it. It blamed the CMC for failing to manage the garbage disposal process effectively.
The report also stated that no scientific methodology had been followed in the payment of compensation to the people affected by the tragedy. The report had further revealed that their had been no focus on the issue of garbage disposaleven after the tragedy occurred.
The Auditor General had recommended that the Municipal Ordinance be amended and that a proper recycling system should be put in place as soon as possible.
It has been revealed that a prior warning given by an expert attached to University of Peradeniya in 2016 had been ignored. The Auditor General has stated that the tragedy would not have occurred if the authorities had taken the warning seriously.
The Auditor General had made another staggering disclosure that garbage had been dumped in Meethotamulla for several years despite a court order issued against dumping garbage at this spot in 2009. Another startling revelation included in the report was that the CMC had obtained vehicles to dispose garbage from an organization which is not specialized in hiring such special purpose vehicles.
The report of the Auditor General was presented to the CMC yesterday by SLPP member Sharmila Gonawala who claimed that compensation has not been paid to the victims of this tragedy. Mayor Rosy Senanayake assured that she will look into the report and inform the council on the situation.(Yohan Perera)

Merkel defends nuclear deal, Iran says won?t ?surrender? to US
	
?
RUETERS, 16th MAY, 2018-German Chancellor Angela Merkel pushed back on Wednesday against Washington?s rejection of the Iran nuclear deal, saying the accord helped outside powers worried about Tehran?s regional role to pursue their concerns with the Islamic Republic.
Iran reiterated it would not surrender to U.S. pressure and would resist U.S. ?plots?, following President Donald Trump?s abandonment of the 2015 agreement last week.
Repudiating the result of more than a decade of diplomacy, Trump complained that the deal does not cover Iran?s ballistic missiles, its role in regional wars or what happens after the pact begins to expire in 2025.
Major European countries share Trump?s concerns but argue that the nuclear deal is the best way to stop the increasingly influential regional power from obtaining an atomic weapon.
Merkel reasserted a defence of the deal in remarks to lawmakers in the Bundestag lower house of parliament.
?The question is whether you can talk better if you terminate an agreement or if you stay in it ... we say you can talk better if you remain in it,? she said.
?This agreement is everything other than ideal, but Iran is, according to all the knowledge of the international nuclear authorities, sticking to the commitments of the agreement.?
The deal between Iran and six world powers lifted most international sanctions in 2016 in return for Tehran curbing its nuclear programme, under strict surveillance by the U.N. nuclear watchdog.
Trump last week announced he planned to reimpose an array of sanctions lifted by the accord, and the U.S. Treasury on Tuesday imposed sanctions on Iran?s central bank governor, three other individuals and an Iraq-based bank.
Iran meanwhile said the new U.S. sanctions were an attempt to derail efforts to save the deal.

'Mystery disease' claims 5 lives, health authorities on high alert
	
A disease that was suspected to have caused the death of five individuals in the last month alone in the Southern Province has put health authorities on high alert.
Chief Epidemiologist Dr. Anil Dissanayake told Daily Mirror that they had been informed by officials at the Karapitiya Teaching Hospital of this ailment which had an unusual pattern and affects the patient's respiratory system.
?The Health Ministry, Epidemiology Unit and Medical Research Institute are conducting tests in order to identify the causes of this disease which has only been contracted by a few individuals in the Southern Province,? he said.
Director Karapitiya Teaching Hospital Dr. Jayampathy Senanayake confirmed that five persons who had received treatment for this condition had died last month. He said the main symptoms were fever, coughing and breathing difficulties which were similar to pneumonia. He said they believe the disease was caused by a virus.
?Steps are being taken to prevent this condition from spreading and the Southern Province Health Services? Director was heading these efforts. However, there is no reason for people to panic,? he said. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)

North Korea threatened Wednesday to cancel the forthcoming summit between leader Kim Jong Un and President Donald Trump if Washington seeks to push Pyongyang into unilaterally giving up its nuclear arsenal.? ?
It also cancelled high-level talks due Wednesday with Seoul over the Max Thunder joint military exercises being held between the United States and South Korea, denouncing the drills as a ?rude and wicked provocation?.? ?
It is a sudden and dramatic return to the rhetoric of the past by Pyongyang, after months of rapid diplomatic rapprochement on the peninsula.? ?
?If the US is trying to drive us into a corner to force our unilateral nuclear abandonment, we will no longer be interested in such dialogue,? first vice foreign minister Kim Kye Gwan said in a statement carried by state media.? ?
In that case, he added, Pyongyang would have to ?reconsider? its participation at the summit, due in Singapore on June 12.? ?
The North?s arsenal is expected to be at the top of the agenda of the historic talks, but Pyongyang has long insisted it needs the weapons to defend itself against invasion by the US.? ?
Washington is pressing for its complete, verifiable and irreversible denuclearisation. But so far the North has not given any public indication of what concessions it is offering, beyond euphemistic commitments to denuclearisation of the ?Korean peninsula?.? ?
Pyongyang had ?made clear on several occasions that precondition for denuclearisation is to put an end to anti-DPRK hostile policy and nuclear threats and blackmail of the United States?, minister Kim said.? ?

He said as the only ?Bandaranayake ?in active politics today, he took great pain to leave the SLFP.
?I condemn moves to give political powers and privileges to those who joined the SLFP recently who are unable to win even a ward of an urban council. They are only using them for their own benefit. So I decided to join a people friendly political force,? he said.
Mr. Bandaranayake said he had remained in the unity government respecting the decision of the party leader and added that he could no longer do so or he would lose his respect in the face of unending betrayals.
?I represented the SLFP in the Gampaha district for 20 years after the retirement of my father after 30-years of service. We managed to serve the people with clean hands. Even a political rival has not charged us of being involved in corrupt politics,? he said.
He said the SLFP supporters are helpless and they have no option other than to have regrets over the fate of the party today.

Passport to the murky world of contraceptives for housemaids
	
Two months ago, unrest sparked across the country due to the speculation that a pill that causes infertility had been mixed with a food served in a small restaurant in Ampara. 
The particle was later found to be mere lumps of flour. Nevertheless, did you know that a considerable number of Sri Lankan women, who work in the Gulf as housemaids, regardless of their race, have been unwillingly taking ?the most dangerous contraceptive in the world? Depo-Provera which is banned in the USA??
The Human Rights Watch report in 2007 documented cases in which Sri Lankan female prospective domestic workers have been administered contraceptive injections without their informed consent and, in some cases, against their will. This was again reported in an article published in The Guardian on April 6, this year, making headlines in local newspapers. On the following day, the Government of Sri Lanka (GoSL) said no contraceptives were administered to Sri Lankan female migrant workers and added that only a medical check-up is conducted prior to these Sri Lankans leaving the country. The Daily Mirror investigations uncovered that the findings in the HRW report were true and the administration of the Depo-Provera injection for potential housemaids is still taking place.
Gauri Kathamuththu from Valaichchenai, Batticaloa had to become the breadwinner for her family when her husband left her just few days after their first baby was born. She was 21 years old by that time. Lack of employment opportunities in her area made her choose migration to the Gulf as the survival strategy. Deceived by the pretty image painted by local travel agents about a housemaid job, Gauri decided to fly to Saudi Arabia which is considered to be the most favoured destination of housemaids. But in reality this? nation is the hardest for housemaids to do their jobs. Gauri, who was desperate to provide education for her daughter and bear all her expenses, was thrilled by the commission worth Rs. 200,000 which she received from the sub-agent.
She said details of her passport were falsified by the travel agent in order to meet the age requirement which is 25. She was dressed with a hijab to look like a Muslim. She was given a Muslim name. She said she was told by the agent that the details were changed to portrait her as a Muslim female because many employers in the Middle East prefer Muslim domestic workers.
Gauri who was accompanied by the sub-agent to Colombo got the compulsory medical check-up done for Rs. 9,500 at a private medical centre supervised by GAMCA (Gulf Approved Medical Centers Association). In the medical certification, she was found ?FIT? to travel.
As per the Rules and Regulations for Medical Examination of Expatriates Recruited to work in the GCC (Gulf Cooperation Council) States, those pre-departure medical check-ups can be carried out only by a selected number of private medical centres which are under the GAMCA. That means the GoSL plays no role in pre-departure medical check-ups.
?Those medical professionals in the particular medical centre asked me to visit them once I got my menses in the same month. When I asked why, the sub-agent and the medical staff said my medical check-up had to be completed before the departure,? Gauri said.
Without her informed consent, Gauri was given a highly effective injectable contraceptive called Depo-Provera which prevented her fertility for three months. When she was given this injection back in 2000, she had no clue why it was given and how the injection works within a female body.
?They indicated that the injection was to prevent any diseases. I thought prevention is anyway better than cure. So I agreed,? she recalled.
According to Gynaecologist Dr. U.D.P. Ratnasiri, Medroxy Progesterone Acetate (Depo-Provera) is a Progestogen commonly used for female contraception. It suppresses ova production and ovulation and also causes thickening of cervical mucus in the uterus. Both these properties prevent conception and it is a highly effective method of contraception, Dr. Ratnasiri said.
He outlined that offering any method of family planning needs thorough counseling by a medical professional who?ll look into the details of why it?s required, advantages and its disadvantages.
He said this drug, which can be injected at any stage during menstruation, is effective from the day of administration for twelve weeks.
?Women leaving as housemaids to Middle Eastern countries may be susceptible for rape and sexual harassment. Yet, it is unethical and dangerous to inject Medroxy Progesterone Acetate without proper counseling and obtaining her consent. I feel it is a violation of women?s rights,? Gynaecologist Ratnasiri said.
He explained that it is always important to identify the disease condition of a woman, assess the safety of the drug and then counsel the couple about the advantages and disadvantages of the method before offering it.
?Some of the disease conditions contraindicating this injection are migraine, headache, women at high risk of thromboembolism, active liver disease, unexplained vaginal bleeding, hypertension with cardiovascular disease and stroke,? he said.
However, it poses a serious question as to whether the so-called medical staffers in these private medical centres, which are unmonitored by the Government, comprise experts and qualified people who are tasked with evaluating these medical factors before administering the Depo injection.
Side effects of the drug?
In females, the most common side effects of Depo are acne, changes in menstrual flow, drowsiness and the causing of birth defects in the instance of being used by those pregnant. Other common side effects include breast tenderness, increased facial hair, decreased scalp hair, difficulty in sleeping or remaining asleep, stomach pain, and weight loss or gain. According to the doctor, when the injection is taken for more than two years it increases the risk of Osteoporosis which can lead to bone fractures.
Since 2000 Gauri has been travelling to Gulf countries including Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Jordan every two years. By the time we interviewed her, it was three months since she had returned from Saudi. She has been taking the Depo injection every two years. She is now fully aware why the injection is administered and what kind of role the injection plays in her body.
?I am prepared to fly to Kuwait on May 21. Now, I am expecting my menses on May 18 and hope to visit Colombo and get the Depo injection,? she said.
Dr. Ratnasiri said that the constant use of the Depo injection, as any other contraceptive, can have a great impact on the female body. Gauri is experiencing various difficulties with regard to her health after she started taking the injection.?
?I get menses thrice during a month. Bleeding thrice during a month makes me physically weak. I am going abroad to work as a housemaid. I am responsible in looking after kids in the employer?s house, cooking, cleaning and doing all other household work. I take few hours of sleep. I don?t even get nourishing food,? she narrated her ordeal.
She said this irregular menstrual cycle has even affected her mental health.?
?At times, I suffer from depression, tiredness, anger and even experience sleep disorders. When I develop these health difficulties at work, I have to suffer more in the house because all what the employers need is work,? she said.
Gauri is now 39 years old. She is currently preparing to go to Kuwait. Her 18-year-old daughter is living with her grandmother (Gauri?s mother). Although she is still experiencing all these troubles while working as a housemaid in the Gulf, she still wants to continue working abroad.
?I don?t want my daughter to face the same situation I experienced. I will struggle to give her a beautiful future. She will not even think of flying to the Middle East to work as a housemaid,? she said.
Gauri?s is just one among many stories from Valaichchenai. Many women who have undergone the same ? may be worse?experiences can be found in the area. Lakshmi is one of them. She started her career back in 1990 at the age of 28. She stopped going to the Gulf in 2012. She is now 56.
Lakshmi told the Daily Mirror that she was also given the same Depo injection repeatedly during the 22 years she was employed as a housemaid.
?I have experienced severe abdominal pains and headaches. I cannot explain in words how much I suffered due to the effects of the injection. Contraceptive options that are safe and appropriate for one woman may not work for another. Why don?t these doctors know about it? Why do these agents and even doctors play with our bodies,? she asked.
According to Lakshmi, there are several women in her area who had worked in Saudi as housemaids before getting married. Later, when they got married, they had not been able to conceive a baby. ?Due to the constant use of Depo, they became sterile,? Lakshmi said.
?When they could not give a baby to their husbands, their mothers-in-law asked them to leave the house. Can anyone understand the pathetic situation these innocent women are in ?? said she.
Neither Gauri nor Lakshmi had a single document to prove the injection was given. They said it is normally not documented.
Meanwhile, the Daily Mirror spoke to Rahini Bhaskaran, Coordinator of Inayam Migrants Network, an organisation working for safe migration. She said, as an activist and also as a woman, she is very disappointed in the silent approach the GoSL is taking without punishing those who are responsible for these acts.?
She said that most of these women were not informed about what tests were being performed and why they were performed. ?They were not even given their medical certificates. The travel agents attached to GAMCA Medical Centers are taking care of it. Those who perform these check-ups do not follow medical standards,? she said.?
?Every single woman has a right to decide what?s good for her body. The right to bodily autonomy and integrity guarantees the right of all individuals to refuse unwanted medical treatment. They have already faced various difficulties at their homes. Such illegal practices double their difficulties. This is unfair and inhumane. This administration of contraceptive injection has to be stopped,? affirmed Bhaskaran.
The Daily Mirror also spoke with several travel agents operating in Colombo area. Jaffer of New Kingdom Manpower in Borella said according to new rules the Depo injection is not administered.
?New rules and regulations advise not to give the contraceptive injection to housemaids anymore. Accordingly, only MMR (Measles, Mumps and Rubella) injection is given to both male and female migrant workers,? he said.
When specifically asked about the Depo injection, Jaffer said he was not aware of any medical vaccines given to migrant workers since he was not interested in the subject. He said that his only concern is to take care of recruitment procedure of the migrant workers and make sure it is done in a law-abiding manner.
?When we send a migrant worker to any of the GAMCA medical centers, it is mandatory for her to undergo the medical check-up. If its results are okay, she is given the MMR vaccine. We have nothing to do with the medical matters pertaining to workers. We don?t bother about those matters,? he said.
According to Jaffer, the main two reasons for the Sri Lankan housemaids to return before the contract expires are contracting Tuberculosis (TB) or getting pregnant.
Readers might query as to why the effect of the injection lasts for only three months? What would happen if the housemaids get pregnant after three months?
Jaffer had answers to those questions.
According to him, there is a three-months probation in the contract of employment which every housemaid is subject to. As per the contract, if a housemaid gets pregnant during the first three months of employment, the relevant travel agent will be responsible in bringing her back to Sri Lanka, bearing the travel cost. Not only the travel cost, the agent will also have to take care of the expenses in filling the job vacancy by recruiting another housemaid.
As per the contract, travel agents are bound to make sure that these housemaids will not get pregnant within the first three months. After the first three months, the responsibility of housemaids is transferred from Sri Lankan travel agent to the relevant employer.
?If they get pregnant after three months, we are not responsible in finding a replacement. It is the GCC law,? he said. Jaffer?s revelation indicated the obvious reason why agents ask housemaids to take the contraceptive injection.
Faroos Marikkar, another travel agent, spoke to the Daily Mirror regarding the Depo issue. He has been in the foreign employment field for the past thirty five years.
In another startling revelation, he said that the GAMCA had instructed agents to submit a guarantee that the migrant worker will not get physically unfit during the first three months of her contract. The loved ones of these housemaids opine that it is ridiculous how a recruitment agent can give a medical guarantee to this effect. He was of the view that the guarantee is used as a shield by the medical centers in order to avoid any payments to the travel agents in case the migrant worker is found to be physically unfit during the probation period.
Meanwhile, Faroos also explained why the Depo injection is given to housemaids.
?A huge amount of money is paid to a housemaid as a commission before she is sent to the country. According to the GCC laws, if a woman gets pregnant while working there, she is sent back to where she came from. If this happens during the first three months, we are in trouble. When they return, it is very difficult to recover the lost money from them,? he said.
During the interview, Faroos called a Manager of a medical center known to him. The lady said Depo is no longer administrated in her medical center which is also supervised by the GAMCA.
?Medical? staffers unqualified
She told Faroos that a housemaid had died of severe negative effects of Depo injection three years ago. Following this death, she said her medical center had stopped giving the injection. She did not mention about the details of this death.
Meanwhile, Faroos alleged that medical staffs working in GAMCA medical centers are neither qualified nor experienced doctors.
?Why can?t these women go to a government hospital and get the check-ups ? Government hospitals are heavens compared to these small medical centers which don?t even have proper facilities. As this is a business, these medical centers are concerned about profit and loss. Therefore, they hire cheap medical professionals,? he claimed.
He was of the view that inaction and negligence on the part of the government had become a blessing for these private medical centers. He emphasized that the Government should take over and monitor all areas of the foreign employment field.
?These medical centers sometimes issue false medical certificates. We send women because we have confidence in the medical certification. But, we often have to face much financial losses when migrant workers are found to be physically unfit just after landing in the respective countries,? he remarked.
Both the travel agents said that the administration of the Depo injection has been stopped. Even an official from the Association of Licensed Foreign Employment Agencies (established under Sri Lanka Bureau of Foreign Employment (SLBFE) Act no. 21 of 1985) also said that this practice had been stopped several years ago.
The writer contacted four private medical centers operating under the supervision of the GAMCA in the suburbs of Colombo under the guise of another desperate woman expecting to travel to Saudi in search of employment as a housemaid.
A laboratory officer of MediLab (Pvt) Ltd located in Colombo said the the administration of Depo injection is still happening at their workplace.
MediSense Laboratory (Pvt) Ltd in Battaramulla and Ohlums Clinic and Laboratories in Colombo 08 said the Depo injection is administered by their medical staff to housemaids under their informed consent. Those who are unwilling to receive the injection must submit a guarantee from their respective travel agents.
A spokesperson of Blue Cross Medical Centre (Pvt) Ltd in Rajagiriya said they only provide housemaids with MMR injections.
The HRW report in 2007 said that the labour agent or sub-agent coerced some women into getting the birth control injection. In some cases, labour agents told domestic workers that if they declined the injected contraceptive, the agency would not assist them if they became pregnant, even in the case of being raped by their employers.
According to the HRW report, an SLBFE official confirmed that the bureau is aware that ?there is a tendency? for contraceptive injections to be administered to prospective domestic workers during the compulsory medical exam, although it is not a Government policy.The SLBFE reports that it hasn?t received complaints from migrant workers regarding the administration of contraceptives. Some domestic workers reported that they didn?t complain about the administration of contraceptives because they were not aware of their right to refuse the injectable contraceptive. In some cases they did not know what medication had been administered.
Attempts made to contact R.K. M. P. Randeniya, Deputy General Manager of the Sri Lanka Foreign Employment Bureau (SLFEB), were futile. However, another highly placed source attached to the SLFEB, speaking on terms of anonymity, said that they are fully aware of the administration of contraceptive injection on housemaids.
?This is not legal. This is a human rights violation. But, this practice is taking place unofficially. We have no control over the operations of the GAMCA or any of their private medical centers.
?I don?t think even the Ministry of Health is monitoring how these medical check-ups are carried out. There is no proper mechanism to address this problem. Since the GAMCA and its medical centres are controlled by the GCC specified rules and regulations, the scope for the GoSL to get involved in the issue is very limited,? the source stated.
Proving the agents? claims, the SLFEB official said many Gulf countries demand a three-month guarantee that the housemaid will not become pregnant. In case if she is found pregnant within that period, agents take full responsibility regarding the housemaid. Agents with the support of the GAMCA are administering this injection to housemaids to avoid incurring any extra expenses in the case a pregnancy takes place,? he explained.
?A permanent visa is issued to housemaids only if they complete the three months (100 days) duration without getting pregnant. The local agents are responsible only within the 100 days,? he added.
Seriously endangers health
According to US media reports, over two million women around the world rely on contraception (a synthetic hormone) manufactured by a U.S.-based multinational, the Upjohn Company.
The drug?s nickname around the world is ?The Shot.? Depo differs from most other contraceptive drugs in that it is injectable; one ?shot? can prevent pregnancy for three months. Injected into the arm or buttock in a 150 millilitre dose, one shot of Depo-Provera lasts at least three months. Experts have stated that Depo users may be seriously endangering their health.
In the US, because of possible safety issues Depo-Provera has never been approved for use as a contraceptive. The current law prohibits the export of drugs banned or unapproved for use in the U.S. to other countries. Upjohn gets around that restriction by producing the drug in Belgium and Canada ? two of about 80 countries including Sri Lanka where Depo-Provera is registered or approved as a contraceptive.
The use of the drug as a contraceptive is prohibited in the US, the place where the drug was originated. Yet, its widespread use in Africa and other underdeveloped countries, including Sri Lanka, according to some critics, queries whether an unsafe drug is being peddled to a largely illiterate and uneducated public.
The Daily Mirror contacted the GAMCA expecting answers to all these questions. They ruled out the administration of Depo to housemaids.
According to the GAMCA, there are 14 medical centres in Sri Lanka that are registered and licensed by the Private Health Services Regulatory Council of Sri Lanka, which have been approved by the Gulf Health Council [A central organisation whose members are the Health Ministries of the GCC States working towards a common goal for health standards among the 07 GCC States] to issue pre-departure medical certification prior to granting of entry visa to GCC States for persons travelling from Sri Lanka.
?
Responding to questions in an email interview, the GAMCA Colombo in its replies said that the purpose of the pre-departure health screening is to verify that persons travelling are free from certain communicable and non-communicable diseases as stipulated by the Gulf Health Council. The council believes that doing so is in the best interest of the public health of the citizens of the GCC States.
As per the guidelines a person undergoing medical certification will be found ?UNFIT? under the diseases stated below.
Infectious diseases
HIV reactive
	Hepatitis B surface antigen positive and Anti HCV
	Microfilaria positive and malaria blood film positive
	Known leprosy patient
	Venereal diseases VDRL positive and TPHA positive
	Tuberculosis any type
	Pulmonary by chest X-ray showing active or past evidence of old T.B. including minimum fibrosis, calcification and pleural thickening
	Tuberculosis pleural effusion
	?
Non-Infectious diseases
Chronic renal failure
	Chronic hepatic failure
	Congestive heart failure
	Uncontrolled hypertension
	Uncontrolled diabetes mellitus
	Known case of cancer
	Psychiatric diseases and neurological disorders
	Physical disability
	Any major operation
	Haemoglobin below 10mg/100ml
Others
Pregnancy
The organisation said the pre-departure screening is performed with regard to Sri Lankan nationals travelling for employment, higher studies, migration etc., to countries such as South Korea, Malaysia, UK, Australia, New Zealand and Canada by medical centers approved by relevant departments of those countries as well.
With regard to the question on the Depo injection, the GAMCA said they could clearly state that the medical screening is limited to the guidelines stated above.
The relationship between female hormones and mental health is razor-sharp. Doctors have said that the monthly menstrual cycle affects the way signals pass through female brains. After being affected by the constant use of Depo injection, women like Gauri and Lakshmi are suffering both physically and mentally.
The HRW report recommended a range of guiding principles for medical treatment, including ensuring patient autonomy in decision-making, ensuring non-discrimination, accountability and access to remedies.
Unfortunately, these Sri Lankan housemaids are considered as ?instrumental? to the development of the country. The significant role played by housemaids should be recognized and respected. What housemaids are vulnerable to should be recognized and proper steps should be taken to minimize such difficulties.
Desperate housemaids migrate to build a house, purchase land, pay off debts, escape from abusive spouses, pay for education-related costs for their children, pay for the care of the sick, unemployed, or elderly relatives, provide dowries for themselves or their children, meet their families? daily needs for food and clothing, replace family resources depleted due to alcohol depending husbands, and purchase necessary equipment for micro-enterprises they planned to launch, the HRW stated in its report.
These housemaids have already endured so much. It is vital to explore the circumstances of each woman and make her aware of the matters related to the contraceptive. What?s disappointing is how the Government authorities were quick to rule out the administration of the Depo and spoke to the media as if this practice has never existed.
The Government authorities may be fully aware of the Depo practice, yet their hands may be tied so that they are unable to take any action against those operating within a powerful travel agents network or these medical organizations which are under the control of the ?all powerful? Gulf Health Council. However, it is super important that the Government and all other so-called women?s rights organizations stand up and inquire into these claims. If the inquiries expose wrongdoers, penalties must be imposed on them. It is only then that media exposure on such dangerous practices will serve a purpose.

People reject both  family  rule and cronyism
	
Megapolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka, in an interview with Daily Mirror, speaks about the next Presidential election. He also responds to the question whether he will come forward as the candidate and about his participation in a programme at Harvard University in the United States. He shared the following:-
?
?
?
SLFP is dead now??
	UNP can never form?a Govt single-handedly in future?
	I work for the victory of policies, not individuals? ? ?
Q You played a pivotal role in the installation of this government. Its term has now come to the tail end. How do you look at it retrospectively?
The government ensured openness, dispelled fear and empowered society. These were the urgent requirements of this country?s society. The ad hoc powers vested with executive presidency were pruned. There was a democratic environment ensured in the governing system.? ?
Be that as it may, the government failed to have a clear-cut economic path. People yearned for a political system where meritocracy was rewarded. That is one downside of the government. Though the leaders of the two main parties joined hands, no such unity took place among the rank and file. The political cultures of the main parties did not undergo structural transformations.? ?
The urgent reforms in certain sectors were not realized. We made the judiciary independent. Yet, we failed to make it efficient and impartial enough. There is a backlog of 270,000 cases in the judicial system. It takes 17.5 years on average for court to dispense with a case. We cannot expect justice from a system like this. There was no legal redress in regard to cases related to mega frauds. The judicial service was not made efficient enough. It became apparent that powerful and influential individuals could escape the legal web.? ?
In our country, certain professional groups maintain their own mafias. Society suffers as a result. In 2016, there were 1410 demonstrations and protest rallies. Investment is unrealistic in the absence of industrial peace. There is a drop in the use of credit facilities offered by the banking system during the past few years.? ?
Professionals?with technological skills should?join politics
Q If it is a failure in that sense during the last three years, would there be any success in the future with the latest Cabinet reshuffle?
I don?t say the government is a total failure. Today, anybody can discuss and debate this failure because of the democratic atmosphere created by the government. Otherwise, media men were subjected to assaults on the roads in the past. In fact, there is democratic freedom in excessive form.? ?
Q Do you mean to say that this freedom has to be regulated?
I don?t mean regulation. Yet, the country needs stable governance. If people get onto the street for every trivial matter and media exaggerates fake information with vested interests, society will be led in?
disarray eventuality.? ?
Q Will you anticipate any economic revival within the next one and-a-half years?
We have three systems of governance in the world today. One is scientific governance. Governance has to be done in a scientific manner. It means the government should scientifically identify economic targets and priorities to be realized, subject to a proper review mechanism. As for education, the government should identify whether it should prioritize investment in primary education, secondary education, vocational training, tertiary education or research and development. Then, we have to do a background study on the area identified and implement. We should decide scientifically whether we should build electronic classrooms or distribute tabs among schoolchildren. That is the scientific method.? ?
Then, there is democratic governance. Here, the governing side, along with the approval of the opposition if possible, identifies priority areas- for example, education, highways etc- in a democratic manner. If the majority of people want highways, the government goes for it albeit it is needed absolutely or not in scientific perspective. It all depends on the democratic will of people.? ?
The third one is ad hoc governance as I call it. Here, you find the implementation of fancy ideas of those in power.? ?
In Sri Lanka, apart from the 1970-75 and the 1978-94 governments, there had always been ad hoc governance. The two governments, I mentioned first, tried to follow democratic governance whether we like or not. There has never been scientific governance in our country.??
Q Do you advocate the scientific governance?
Yes, I stress that this country needs scientific governance.? ?
Q You recently attended a workshop at Harvard University in the United States. It is a programme dedicated for topnotch political leaders across the globe. What do you feel about your selection?
It is the biggest university in the world. It is a powerful seat of learning in areas such as finances, business studies and politics. The world leaders from John F. Kennedy to Barak Obama have studied there. Even the current Singaporean Prime Minister had studied there. A number of Sri Lankan leaders have also studied there. President Maithripala Sirisena also went there once. I was able to learn how the countries that matter to us in the world are governed.? ?
Q With such an idea in mind, do you harbour any plan to become the President of this country?
?A lot of people say various things to sling mud at us. For anyone to become the President, more than 51 percent of voters should cast their ballots at an election in his or her favour. Those hailing from the background of family rule cannot govern this country in the future. Likewise, those, who advocate cronyism, also cannot run the country. Anyone, who can?t read the pulse of people , cannot take this country forward even by an inch. We tested all. We found both family rule, and cronyism. Now, we need scientific governance driven by meritocracy. The world is headed towards the fourth industrial revolution now. The country can be run by a political leadership that commands technological knowledge. The general public has to understand it. Once they understand it, they will decide who should be the President. Otherwise, some people can day-dream about becoming the President. Yet, they cannot take the country forward.? ?
I don?t say the government is a total failure. Today, anybody can discuss and debate this failure because of the democratic atmosphere
Q Somebody has to come forward as the Presidential Candidate for people to vote?
Yes, people have to vote for him to become the President. All the main political parties and forces have to back him.? ?
Q If these forces choose you as the candidate, are you ready to take it up?
That depends on the circumstances unfolding in the future. I have proved that I am not a person wasting public money. I have been financially -efficient in running whatever ministry assigned to me. I have managed all of them scientifically. I am a person bent on ensuring victories for the policies I cherish. Otherwise, I am not working for my individual gains. I stood for the defeat of LTTE. For that, I worked to elect Mahinda Rajapaksa as President to achieve it.? ?
Q Are you advocating a model similar to the one adopted by China?
China is a good example. When Deng Xiaoping assumed duties as the President, the cadres of the Community Party, involved in the revolution, had been assigned ministerial responsibilities. Deng Xiaoping had a departure from it. He infused professionals to run ministries. Even among the professionals, he chose engineers.? ?
We inherited a political culture from the British that law professionals should be in politics. But, the countries that made giant strides in economic gains chose professionals with technological skills- medical professionals, engineers, architects, valuers and accountants etc. Such professionals can direct the course of economy. Asian countries outsmart the US and the UK in the modern era.? ?
Q You said professionals with technological skills should be allowed to run the country. You are an engineer-cum politician. Does it mean that you are the most eligible person among the current lot?
I don?t say I am the most eligible person. There can be enough and more qualified people around. The brightest students who get through the G.C.E. O/Level Exam choose science and math streams for their A/level studies in the hope of becoming doctors or engineers. How many of them represent the Cabinet today? I ask this question. There is a strong body of professionals in society. They should be brought to politics.? ?
Q In 2015, the diverse political forces were brought under one umbrella to stand up to the then government. How applicable is that political formula for the next presidential election?
One thing is clear. People are not happy merely because there is road development and city beautification. Ours is a middle income country. The middle class is the main political force of Sri Lanka. The mainstream political parties are now devoid of their traditional strength. Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) which won the local government elections got only 40% of votes, the UNP only 29%. A large vote base remains outside the two main parties. The middle class did not recognize the much hyped development work of the Rajapaksa rule.? ?
The defeat of the Rajapaksa rule is interpreted as a phenomenon created by Tamil and Muslim voters. It is not the case. Only the middle-class voters unseated that rule. President Maithripala Sirisena won the Kotte electorate in Colombo with a majority of 10,000 votes despite the fact it is the largest beneficiary of development work initiated by the Rajapaksa rule. The middle-class, along with professionals, did not accept that form of development work.? ?
Q At the election conducted on February 10 this year, the SLPP led by Mahinda Rajapaksa won the local areas such as Kotte, Kaduwela and Homagama where the middle-class is concentrated. How did it happen?
MR hadn?t been able to increase the number of votes polled by him at the last Presidential Election. He has got the votes that remained with him since then. That is all. There is no improvement from that.? ?
New political agenda is needed for these parties to resurrect themselves and stand to the Rajapaksa-led political force
Q Then, how did SLPP get 80,000 votes from Homagama whereas the UNP got only 30,000?
It is a problem of the UNP. The UNP did not realize the mandate given to it. Some UNPers had callous disregard for it. UNP deal makers, driven by political greed, made it a business for amassing wealth. People responded with a thundering slap to it at the election. The UNP made three mistakes. The UNP failed to maintain a clean government in keeping with the mandate. Secondly, the UNP paid scant regards to the development needs at village level. Thirdly, it failed to identify the infrastructure needs in areas of energy supply, water supply and transport, and make investments accordingly.?
I have put forward a programme of work to be implemented in view of the next elections. That is aimed at bringing together the 3.6 million vote base of the UNP and the 1.4 million vote base of President Sirisena while winning over the confidence of the middle class.? ?
It is a fallacy that the UNP can ever form a government singlehandedly. It will never happen in the future. The SLFP is not in a position to field its own candidate. The party is politically dead. The UNP is a party now dying off. A new political agenda is needed for these parties to resurrect themselves and stand to the Rajapaksa-led political force.? ?
Q How crucial are the minority communities? role at the future elections?
The Rajapaksas created a bogus sense of insecurity among the majority community. It was made through allegations such as the victimization of war heroes and the release of LTTE cadres from jail. The Rajapaksa government released 12260 LTTE cadres. This government did not release even a single LTTE cadre with charges served against him. There are 30 army personnel in custody for reasons such as their alleged involvement in the assassination of Lasantha Wickramatunga, assault on Keith Noyahr etc. No one has been taken to task for incidents involving the war.? ? ?

Sanga gives opportunity to fans to own part of Lord?s ground
	
Sri Lankan cricket legend Kumar Sangakkara has joined David Gower, Allan Lamb and Viv Richards to back a new opportunity for fans to own a part of the world-famous Lord?s Cricket ground.
Sangakkara is supporting New Commonwealth?s once in a lifetime opportunity to purchase a part of the ?Mecca of cricket? to anyone around the world. The firm are offering cricketing heroes and ordinary fans alike the opportunity to own a piece of ?the mecca of cricket?, which has been built on block-chain technology.
Limited fans can purchase a share of the historic ground with costs starting at just GBP 500. People signing up will own a piece of the most famous cricket ground in the world, gaining a souvenir, keepsake, and perhaps someday additional benefits.
For decades, only wealthy speculators or property firms have been able to invest in London?s most exclusive property investments. Speaking on this development, Sangakkara said, ?This ground is a sporting inspiration for cricket fans across the globe, so it?s incredible that everyone now has the opportunity to own part of it. Some of the most cherished memories of my playing career were made in this ground, and it was an honour to entertain so many fans here. Owning my piece of Lord?s will now help preserve those memories for me and my family, and I hope fans will take this once in a lifetime opportunity to buy their share.?

Johann Peries, Sri Lanka?s famed mountain climber and adventurer, is set to make his ascent to the peak of Mount Everest in a few days. If the weather clears, Johann hopes to leave Base Camp on Saturday 19th May, climbing up to Camp 3 by 21st May and on to Camp 4 by the next day, before making his bid for the summit on 23rd May.
Johann has been in the Himalayas since April, when he began his Everest expedition as part of a larger team led by International Mountain Guides (IMG), a globally renowned mountaineering company with more than a dozen successful Mt. Everest Expeditions. For the past few weeks, Johann has been performing a series of climbing rotations which prepare the climbers for higher altitudes and the Himalayan terrain.
Johann has completed three such training rotations, climbing all the way up to Camp 3 which is 7,162m above sea level and the fourth highest peak in the world. He has also been undergoing a series of ladder training exercises and other glacier-trekking exercises to help him prepare for the final stage of his Everest climb. Johann and other climbers have been experiencing bad weather throughout the current climbing season, and it is hoped the jet streams at the summit will ease in time for the final summit ascent.
This last phase of Johann?s climb is the most treacherous and also most challenging ? the area beyond Camp 4 and the Summit is known as the Death Zone because of its perilous conditions, where strong winds, narrow plateaus, steep ridges await the climbers and because in this zone the organs of the body start to slowly shut down because of the depleted oxygen saturation in the air. Johann has been in intense training for this climb since December 2017.
This is Johann?s second attempt to summit Mount Everest. In April 2016, he and Jayanthi Kuru-Utumpala were the first Sri Lankans to attempt to summit the peak, but Johann was forced to turn back at 8,400m, a mere 448m short of reaching the summit, due to technical difficulties with his equipment. Kuru-Utumpala went on to complete the climb, becoming the first Sri Lankan to scale Mt. Everest.
Encouraging Johann on this second Everest bid is the ?Climb Everest with Johann? campaign, which has drawn the support of hundreds of Sri Lankans through its dedicated website. The campaign allows Johann?s Fellow-Sri Lankans to sponsor each step he takes on the mountain for Rs.100 a step. The cost of Johann?s expedition is estimated to amount to USD 58,600 and each sponsored step goes towards these costs.?
Johann has dedicated this Everest Expedition to all Sri Lankans, and he is hopeful of raising the Sri Lankan Flag at the Everest Summit in a few days.

Two Maldivians arrested with ecstasy pills worth Rs.10 mn
	
Two Maldivians were arrested by the Police Special Task Force (STF) on charges of possessing 1,925 ecstasy pills with a street value of more than Rs.10 million during a raid at Nadimala in Dehiwala last night.
The STF said this was the largest quantity of such pills it had detected.
It said the two Maldivians had imported the pills from The Netherlands through a courier service.
The suspects aged 19 and 25 were residing at apartments in Kalubowila and Dehiwala.
The arrests were made on a tip off while they were on their way to sell the pills to customers.
The STF said it believed that apart from selling these pills in Sri Lanka, the suspects were exporting them to other countries as well.
The raid was conducted by personnel led by STF Organized Crimes Unit OIC Chief Inspector Nadeeka Silva on the instructions of STF Commandant Senior DIG M.R. Lateef.
The suspects were handed over to the Police Narcotic Bureau.(Darshana Sanjeewa)

US economic boom adversely affects SL: PM
	
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe today said the economic growth in the US has had a negative impact on Sri Lanka and other developing nations.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said this at the International Nurses? day programme at Temple Trees.
He said the US dollar had picked up with the economy boom in the USA and that had resulted in the devaluation of currencies of countries such as Sri Lanka and Argentina.
However, he said Sri Lanka would be able to manage the economy as the Central Bank Governor recently said.
This, he said was because Sri Lanka?s foreign reserves were adequate and was set to swell up to $ 11 billion.
He also said the 2015 presidential election came as a blessing as the present government which came to power that year has been able to manage the debt service issue effectively.
?There were no funds to settle interests during years of 2013 and 2014. The Previous government went on to hold the presidential elections as it failed to resolve the debt issue which the country was facing at that time,? the Prime Minister said.
?The present government has been able to pay the interests for its debts and had been able to manage the economy. However, those who ran away without resolving the debt services issue are now trying to tell us how to run the economy,? he added in an aggressive tone. (Yohan Perera)

Our continued above-industry growth is a testament to the success of our strategy.?

?
Ranjan Kalia, Chief Financial Officer, said, ?We delivered strong fiscal year 2018financial results highlighted by approximately 19% revenue growth, 200 basis points of non-GAAP operating margin accretion, and 30% non-GAAP earnings per share growth. Our fourth quarter revenue was modestly below the midpoint of our guidance range, and our non-GAAP EPS was above the midpoint driven byslightly better than expected eTouch contribution. Looking to fiscal 2019, our current guidance calls for continued above-industry organic revenue growth, coupled with earnings growing faster than consolidated revenue growth.??
?
Financial Outlook?
?
Virtusa management provided the following current financial guidance:
?
? First quarter fiscal 2019 revenue is expected to be in the range of $293.5 to $301.5 million. GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be in the range of $0.09 to $0.13. Non-GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be in the range of $0.45to $0.51.
?
? Fiscal year 2019 revenue is expected to be in the range of $1,230to $1,270million. GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be in the range of $0.50to $0.66. Non-GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be in the range of $2.08to $2.32.
?
In accordance with US GAAP, Virtusa applies the if-converted method to its convertible preferred shares when reporting its fiscal year 2018 and fiscal year 2019 results. The if-converted method is used to calculate the share impact of convertible securities.? Under this method, only when the convertible securities are considered dilutive are they then included in the computation of weighted average shares outstanding in reported results and full year guidance.??
?
? Fourth quarter GAAP Income per share was calculated by including the impact of dividends and accretion on the convertible preferred shares in net income available to common stockholders and excluding the impact of the convertible preferred shares from the weighted average shares. Fourth quarter non-GAAP EPS was calculated by excluding the impact of dividends and accretion on the convertible preferred shares from net income available to common stockholders and including the impact of the convertible preferred shares in the weighted average shares outstanding as these shares were dilutive on a non-GAAP basis.?
?
? GAAP EPS guidance was calculated under the assumption that these convertible preferred shares will be anti-dilutive in fiscal 2019. Thus, in determining full fiscal year 2019 GAAP EPS guidance, dividends and accretion on the convertible preferred shares are deducted from net income available to common stockholders and the convertible preferred shares have been excluded from weighted average shares outstanding.?
?
? Non-GAAP EPS guidance was calculated under the assumption that these convertible preferred shares will be dilutive in fiscal year 2019. Thus,in determining full fiscal year 2019 non-GAAP EPS guidance, dividends and accretion on the convertible preferred shares are excluded from net income available to common stockholders and the impact of the convertible preferred shares are included in the weighted average shares outstanding.?
?
The Company?s first quarter and fiscal year 2019 diluted GAAP EPS estimates are both based on average share counts of approximately 30.5million (assuming no further exercises of stock-based awards). The Company?s first quarter and fiscal year 2019 diluted Non-GAAP EPS estimates are both based on average share counts of approximately 33.5 million (assuming no further exercises of stock-based awards). GAAP and Non-GAAP average share counts assume a stock price of $49.01, which was derived from the average closing price of the Company?s stock over the five trading days ended on May9, 2018.? Deviations from this stock price may cause actual diluted EPS to vary based on share dilution from Virtusa?s stock options and stock appreciation rights.?

## Title: What is special about the scientific method?

What is special about the scientific method?
	
When you talk of ideas these days people tend to ask if they had been scientifically proven? Some people reject reincarnation and karma saying these phenomena are not scientifically proven. The scientific method has been taken to such an extent in our minds that some people in Sri Lanka even talk of a ?scientific?cabinet? now.
The question that should be asked then is ?What is so special about science?? What is so special about anything that had been proven scientifically over another that had not been so? How do we separate science and non-science? Science is a word used for progressiveness from the early stages of western modernity and based on that a knowledge system which is called science has been raised over all the other knowledge systems. Is there anything special about science? This is not a new question. Philosophers have tried to answer this question for a long time.
There is a popular definition for science i.e. science is a knowledge which is tested according to the scientific method. This definition gives an answer to the question. Science is special because it is in accordance with the ?scientific method.? Then the next problem is what on earth this scientific method is? For this question the answers are diverse. Anyone who defines scientific method should establish the demarcation between science and non-science and explain why science is superior.
What is the scientific method? Secondary school education has given us a ready-made answer. It is hypothesis, experiment, observation and conclusions. This popular answer is misleading and incomplete. These are only steps of the so-called scientific method. A method is not a list of steps. A method says how to do rather than what to do. These buzzwords say nothing about how things go about in science.
Induction is to make many observations and generalize them to come up with a general statement. This Bacon?s idea is obviously incomplete.
?
Science is mainly about inventing new theories. A theory is a well fabricated story to explain some phenomena and observations. (This definition which is the most sophisticated one among many others is by Dr. Nalin de Silva.) ?How? does a scientist work when he is doing scientific research? This is the question to be answered by philosophers and scientists.
Sir Francais Bacon said scientific method is induction. Induction is to make many observations and generalize them to come up with a general statement. This Bacon?s idea is obviously incomplete. For instances, if we take the theory of gravitation we see things fall and the generalization is not gravitation, but a statement saying everything falls until it meets a barrier. Galileo introduced a term named hypothesis. That means what scientists do is not mere generalization, but to invent an ?explanation? (hypothesis) on observations and then test it.
Testing and verifying theory?
Then the problem is how do we test a theory? How can we verify a theory? As I have mentioned above, a theory is a story. How can we test a story? There is no direct way to test a story. What we can do is to consider the implications of the theory (story) and test them. Before the last century, philosophers of science and scientists believed that a theory can be proved by checking the implications. In non-science theories are not proved by checking implications.
Karl Popper, a rationalist philosopher, challenged these views. He showed that these views of the scientific method are completely illogical. One of his famous statements is that you cannot logically prove that ?All swans are white? by observing thousands of white swans because there is a possibility that the next one is black. When you see a black swan the statement is falsified. Therefore we cannot prove anything by induction. What we can do is only refute a general statement. On the other hand, the statement that if P is Q doesn?t logically imply that if Q is correct then P is correct. For example, if a number gets divided by 4 it gets divided by 2 as well. But it can?t be in reverse. Though 6 is divided by 2 it is not divided by 4. Therefore although the implications of a theory are checked and found to be true, there is no guarantee that the theory is correct. However, we can do one thing. If an implication is found to be wrong we can say the theory is incorrect. We can refute the theory.
Therefore Karl Popper said we cannot prove anything by generalization or checking implications of a theory and therefore what can be done to verify theories in science is to refute them. Then people who expect science to be the path of finding truth had a problem saying that if you cannot prove truth in science then why use it. Popper said that science advances by creating lots of theories and rejecting the falsified ones. When false theories are excluded, true theories will remain. Therefore, the scientific method is falsification. If there is a ?way to prove a hypothesis is false? (not ?proved false?) it is a scientific hypothesis. According to Popper, statements in astrology, psychoanalysis and Marxism provide no way to prove themselves to be false. That is to say they are un-testable, so these fields are non-science. This is Karl Popper?s?critical rationalism.
Paradigm shift?
This idea was challenged by another philosopher Thomas Kuhn. When he studied the history of science for a speech, he understood that falsification is not the ultimate goal of the scientific method. He showed that testing an implication of a theory is not an isolated process. The implication is generated with the help of other existing theories. Other theories and auxiliary assumptions are used also in the experimentation process. Therefore if we find by experiment that an implication of a theory is false, we cannot directly say the theory is false. It should be the fault of other helping theories or auxiliary assumptions. Therefore there is no way to falsify a scientific theory too. This Kuhn?s identification gave life to a new concept: Paradigm. A paradigm is a structure which has a centre theory. In the era of normal science, scientists do not challenge the paradigm. New theories are checked using the theories in the paradigm. Nobody challenges the centre theory. However, there are eras of revolutionary science where the centre theory is challenged and refuted. Then the whole paradigm will collapse to give way to a new paradigm. Different paradigms approach the same problem in completely different ways. Therefore science is unable to prove whether something is true or false, but will only check if it is in accordance with the existing paradigm.
Kuhn also tried to formulate the demarcation between science and non-science. He said that a paradigm shift is only possible?in science.
Then a philosopher named Paul Feyerabend showed by analyzing the Galileo affair and other incidents of science history, that there was no method special to science. He showed that science should not have special advantage over non-science. He said that we should be against the chauvinism of science.
Popper said we cannot prove anything by generalization or checking implications of?a theory
Sri Lankan philosopher Dr. Nalin de Silva also made a contribution to this field. He invented the concept of Chinthanaya. Chinthanaya is the logical, epistemological, and deep philosophical fundamentals of a culture. Culture, Chinthanaya and knowledge of the culture is interrelated. Different cultures have different Chinthanayas and therefore there are different knowledge systems in different cultures. Hence there are different sciences in different cultures. Western science is the science of Greek Judaic Christian (GJC) Chinthanaya which is now dominating the world. No science reveals an absolute truth because there is nothing that could be taken as an objective reality. We all have our own different worlds. Knowledge is not an external truth. It is our construction. Theories are just stories we construct to explain our world. In that sense all knowledge is lies (Boru). Western science which consists of ?abstract? theories with concepts and phenomena that cannot be felt by the senses or imagined is a blatant lie (Pattapal Boru). Do not confuse these terms with their day today life meaning. Dr. Nalin de Silva further explains that other cultures should develop their own science against the oppressive dominance of western science and get rid of western imperialism completely. This is his Constructive Relativism.
Whatever these arguments are the most important thing to remember is that non-science is not just nonsense.
