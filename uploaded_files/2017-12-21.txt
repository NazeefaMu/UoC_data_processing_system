A part of their lives:  The Sooriya Village gears up
	
As I pointed out in my last article, at best I am a spectator and not a connoisseur when it comes to music. When we discover the songs that we grow to love, we are thrilled, so much so that pedagogy and instruction, the finer points of music as a subject to be taught as a series of subjects and courses in an institution, come later. But then pedagogy and instruction are essential, not because they intellectualise a field that cannot really be intellectualised, but because they are a first step, a necessary first step, if one is to inculcate in others a rigorous, instinctive love for music. Nowhere is or can this be truer than in the field of music training for students with special disabilities, especially autism. This piece is about one initiative targeted at that field that?s found its way from one part of the world to another, from the United States to South Asia.??
Rhoda Bernard is the Managing Director of the Berklee Institute for Arts Education and Special Needs, a new, endowed institution aimed primarily at children who are autistic, in fact the first of its kind to be established anywhere. ?Berklee? of course is the Berklee College of Music, in Boston, Massachusetts, referred to in Wikipedia as ?the largest independent college of contemporary music (the emphases are mine) in the world.? With courses ranging from rock to heavy metal, from hip hop and reggae to salsa and flamenco, and with a special merger in 2015 with the Boston Conservatory, it?s a veritable institute that?s probably the best and only of its kind to offer a specialised undergraduate course for music and special needs children.? ?
Bernard?s story takes us back to 2007, a decade ago, when together with the Boston Conservatory she, as a personal project, commenced a series of programmes and workshops that delved into the pedagogy of music with respect to autistic children and even adults. She was pushed to this particular project because, as she herself has pointed out in an interview, there was really very poor support for instructing music teachers on how to teach, and adapt to, special needs students, a problem compounded by the fact that in a typical classroom, the needs of such students are somewhat diluted and subsumed in the needs of other students. Autistic children stand out in their instinctive love for music, but to transform that instinctive love into a lifelong interest is something only the most committed teacher can achieve. Bernard wanted to unleash a horde of such teachers, and to this end began with a private instrumental class.??
She set about this by setting out two broad objectives: get the course beyond music and beyond autism, delving into other visual and aural art forms as well as other forms of special disabilities, and get it beyond the agreement with the Conservatory
There were problems. Firstly, a manifest lack of funds. Bernard got around that, during her first few weeks and months, by concentrating on a tuition driven model that would depend on individual merit and scholarships. From that private instrumental class, moreover, she and her initiative evolved rapidly to other courses, including early childhood programmes that received funding, rather generously, from the National Endowment for the Arts. All these had been punctured by her vision for the entire project, which congealed into two broad philosophies: her belief in group ensembles as opposed to individual recitals when it came to the students, and her belief in differentiating the field she was engaged in (music education) from the field it was accustomed to in general (music therapy).
The difference between therapy and education in that respect, she herself has noted, is notoriously difficult to sustain in the long term, particularly because there?s a significant overlap between the two.??
How so? Because, while therapy is aimed at a particular outcome (predominantly based on behaviour), education, or to be more specific music education, is aimed at making groups interact with and open up to each other. The one is geared at health, at cognitive functions that music can manifestly improve through certain pre-scheduled sessions with a qualified practitioner, while the other is geared at improving skills connected to a field, in this case music. As Bernard herself has observed, the overlap between the two is so considerable that the one cannot be distinguished from the other all the time.
For instance, the group ensembles, the courses and classes designed to get students to interact with each other (through such endeavours as scavenger hunts) have at times led to beginners and infants opening up and saying their first words.? The focus had been from its inception on group recitals, on opening up and being interactive, so Bernard overcame her second problem ? the fact that most if not many special needs kids lack the motor skills that are essential when playing instruments ? by resorting to iPad ensembles. Such new initiatives helped rapidly expand Bernard?s organisation, and soon enough it had evolved into choral ensembles, professional development courses, and mobile workshops that toured the state of Massachusetts and received overwhelmingly positive responses from public school teachers in the schools and institutions visited.
This led to the founding of the first and only graduate programme (in the world) aimed at music and special needs, a Master?s Degree in Music Education with a special focus on autism. Bernard could have grown complacent with all these, but she wasn?t. She wanted more, for her institute and for her students.??
She set about this by setting out two broad objectives: get the course beyond music and beyond autism, delving into other visual and aural art forms as well as other forms of special disabilities, and get it beyond the agreement with the Conservatory. The result of her endeavours and patience in this regard was the Berklee Institute for Arts Education and Special Needs: the focus, as she had always wanted, had spread and become more multifarious.
Going beyond music, the Institute, set up earlier this year, was the grand culmination of probably the most reckonable programmes he had conceived at the Conservatory: the much acclaimed Autism Spectrum Programmes, which parents had grown to love so much that they kept on nagging Bernard to lower the age requirements and start classes for primary and elementary students.??
The new initiative, now successfully implemented at Berklee, has, needless to say, proved to be more exciting for both Bernard and her students. They moreover received a grant recently, which they hope to use to start another welcome programme: what is referred to in autism parlance as Social Stories, helping autistic students develop their interpersonal communication skills, only this time using Virtual Reality (VR) tools.
Encouraged by the reception by the public of her projects and initiatives thus far, Bernard hopes now to develop the programme at Berklee to include undergraduate and minor degree programmes to help empower music teachers involved with special needs children. The problem, here, would be the development and formation of new courses, which has opened her up to another fresh project: a broad and institutional partnership with Autism International Worldwide, a teacher training programme that has expanded into Canada and South Asia. This is where Sri Lanka and the Sooriya?Village come in.??
On Sunday, January 28, 2018, from 5.30 to 7.30 pm, Rhoda Bernard will connect with local music teachers via Skype for a workshop on the pedagogy of music. ?Would you like to integrate the arts into your teaching?? is how the poster for the event puts it, rather acutely I should think, and to a considerable extent that is what the workshop aims at, providing strategies and tactics that can prove useful for guiding, inter alia, autistic students.
Bernard has chosen probably the best location of its kind for her one-day, two-hour virtual workshop in Sri Lanka, because no other location in Colombo caters to the kind of wider milieu that the Sooriya Village caters to. Malinda Seneviratne, who writes, might note (as he did, about two weeks ago, in this paper) that it ?works for me?, and by the same token I have come across positive comments from, among others, Sumitra Peries, Kumar de Silva, Upeka Chitrasena, Dharmasiri Bandaranayake, and the Music Circle of Ananda College (that trained, copiously, for their annual showcase item Rhythm of the Maroons, there, last year).
While ostensibly established for musicians, both aspiring and established, it has taken a life of its own, extending to other art forms: in short, the perfect place for the perfect workshop.??
Obviously, Sri Lanka and the United States are not the one and the same, so it?s pertinent to end my little piece with a reference, cursory though it may be, to some of the finer, more unique points of this workshop. Firstly, the basic elements of the workshop will not differ from the workshops she has conducted at Berklee and earlier at the Conservatory.
Secondly, Bernard?s ideas for ?globalising? (always a notoriously indefinable term) arts and arts education have been nurtured by the fact that Berklee has always been a melting pot, extending its arms to the rest of the world (it isn?t nitpicking to mention here that Sanchitha Wickremesooriya, who de facto runs with his father, Udena, the Sooriya Village, is himself a past student). Thirdly, the workshop has been fine-tuned to accommodate the various ethnic differences real and imagined that are present, today, in Sri Lanka (Bernard: ?I do think that the emphasis on inclusivity that cuts across arbitrary borders amongst participants and students will differ in the South Asian context, for sure.
I am curious to see how those differences play out as I work with the educators in the workshop, as well as through my continuing relationship and collaboration with the Sooriya Village?). Fourthly, while the curricula and the pedagogic philosophies underlying our country and Bernard?s are discernibly different, the principles underlying them in both countries remain essentially the same, easily adaptable to any culture and to educators anywhere.??
There are realities that need to be accommodated, to be sure. But these remain at best trivial, because what Bernard has done, in her special way, speaks to all of us. It took time for me to record what she has achieved in 10 years because words can?t, to borrow an oft-borrowed clich?, do justice to her actions. Clich?d, yes, but true.??

Cabinet approves day to day trials in HC mandatory
	
The Cabinet on Tuesday approved a proposal submitted by Justice Minister Thalatha Atukorale to make Day to Day trials in the High Courts mandatory in order to address laws delays, Cabinet spokesman, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
Minister Atukorale told the Cabinet in her memo that although a circular has been issued to judges by the Judicial Service Commission (JSC) directing that trials over five years old be held day to day, it is observed more in the breach or not carried out properly.
?The proviso to Section 263(1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure, Act, No. 15 of 1979 states that every trial in the High Court with a jury or without a jury shall as far as practicable, be held day to day. Despite this legislative provision, trials are not held day to day and this has resulted in an enormous backlog of cases in the High Court,? Minister Atukorale stressed.
At the end of 2015, there were approximately 16,960 cases pending in the High Courts Islandwide. The total number of cases pending in the High Courts at the end of 2016 was 16,463 and the total number of cases pending up to September in the year 2017 was 17,565, she said.
?This situation has to be remedied without further delay resulting the requirement of an amendment be brought to section 263 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act, No. 15 of 1979 to make mandatory, day to day trials in the High Courts, except in exceptional circumstances and for good reasons which have to be recorded, she stressed.
Accordingly, the Section 263 of the Criminal Procedure Code will be amended to make mandatory day to day trials in the High Court, except in exceptional circumstances an d for good reasons to be recorded, Minister Atukorale noted.
The amendments will be referred to the Legal Draftsman to draft legislation for the purpose shortly. (Sandun A Jayasekera)

Car rams crowd in Melbourne
	
Two men were arrested in Australia after the SUV in which they were travelling rammed into pedestrians on a busy central Melbourne street today, leaving 14 people injured in what police believe was a deliberate act, ABC News reported.
Victoria state police said the driver of the vehicle and a second man were in custody after the incident, which occurred on Flinders Street in the city's central business district just after 4:45 p.m. when the area was busy with Christmas shoppers.
Commander Russell Barrett told media that while the motive of the incident was not immediately clear, "at this stage we believe it was a deliberate act."
Asked if police had ruled out terrorism as motivation, Barrett said only: "At this stage it's early days in the investigation and the motivation is unknown."
Barrett confirmed 14 people had been injured in the attack. Several were taken to hospitals, and two were in critical condition, including a pre-school aged boy with head injuries. Earlier media reports said up to 19 people had been injured.
Witnesses described horrific scenes from the incident, which started when the SUV ran a red light outside the city's iconic Flinders Street train station and sped up to hit pedestrians crossing the road, striking more than a dozen people before crashing into a traffic barrier near a cable car stop.
"I was crossing Flinders Street on the way to the train station. I heard an engine rev behind me and heard a thump," one man identified only as David said on ABC TV. He said he turned around saw "people literally getting thrown into the air as it hit them."
Witnesses said when the car crashed it was rushed by bystanders who started pulling the two men out before police arrived a few minutes later.
Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull sent a tweet calling the incident "shocking" and said his thoughts and prayers were with the victims and those treating them.
Police said officers have been deployed across the area and the site would be closed-off as a crime scene for some time.
"Police will continue to have a strong presence in the Melbourne CBD tonight," Barrett said.
It's the second time this year that Melbourne, regularly ranked one of the world's most livable cities, has been traumatized by a car attack.
In January, six people were killed and more than 30 were injured when a car was driven up a footpath in Bourke Street, near Thursday's incident. Police arrested the driver, who was known to police for a history of illicit drug use, family violence and mental health problems. Police said the case was not terrorism-related.
There have been a number of car attacks in other parts of the world in recent years, many of them linked to terrorism.

CCC House: A home away from home
	
The National Cancer Institute (NCI) in Maharagama is a place where varied emotions are observed. Shaven heads and looks of despair on the faces of both adults and children; a common sight. Within the hospital premises however is a place alive with hope; The Courage Compassion Commitment (CCC) House, a non profit organisation based in Sri Lanka and Australia supporting NCI to provide much needed care for those battling cancer.? ?
The CCC House is a 188-bed cancer transit home for outpatients at the NCI. Modelled after a similar concept practised at the Ronald McDonald House in Australia, the facility is the largest of its kind in Sri Lanka. Established through a tripartite agreement among the NCI, Ministry of Health and the CCC, it facilitates cancer patients of all ages from across?the country.? ?
Today the establishment is a fully equipped transit home providing all facilities required by patients confronting the toughest challenge of their lives
At the time of our visit, the facility was almost unoccupied. The Manager of CCC House, Laksiri Fernando informed us that this was because most patients visit the hospital during the morning hours for their treatment. ?The patients we provide for at the CCC House are those who have to obtain treatment from the hospital regularly. We accommodate patients from as far as Jaffna,? he said. The process of admission and discharge at the CCC House takes place through referrals from the consultant doctors at NCI, while the registration at CCC House and discharge is handled through the wards at the hospital.??
Tusitha Kumarakulasingham of the CCC House Management Committee believes that Former Director of NCI, Dr. Kanishka Karunaratne and Founder and Chairman of CCC House Jetha Devapura were the driving force behind the establishment of the facility. The CCC initiative was first registered as Care for Cancer Children to assist children fighting cancer at the NCI. Their work included several projects to support the paediatric wards of the NCI which included knowledge transfer programmes between the Royal Children?s Hospital (RCH) Melbourne and the NCI. Their work was dedicated to provide the best practice in paediatric oncology treatment and care to benefit child and adolescent patients at the NCI.? ?
Their vision and commitment to serve beyond paediatric cancer treatment is clear to anyone who steps inside the facility. In 2007, following recommendations from experts, the CCC Foundation envisioned the CCC House, a transit home with almost 200 beds at an estimated cost of Rs.180 million. Even though it seemed an impossible task at that time, Phase 1 of the CCC House, consisting of 100 beds was completed in 2010 where child cancer outpatients of the hospital were able to move to CCC House with their care givers, which was soon followed by adults.??
Today the establishment is a fully equipped transit home providing all facilities required by patients confronting the toughest challenge of their lives. The expansive land provided by the Ministry, adjacent to the hospital building, affords patients the convenience of access, vital for their well-being. All meals are provided by the hospital. Each floor of the building has spacious dining rooms where patients can take their meals in a relaxing environment. The first level of the CCC building has direct access to the ground floor of the hospital. We were told that these rooms have been reserved for children in need of wheelchairs. On the day of our visit, 44 out of 45 beds were occupied by children. The total count of patients at the premises was 119.? ?
As we walked through the wards of CCC House, we came across the most inspirational sight. The names of four children residing at the CCC House were written on a notice board opposite a room, where they were sitting for their Ordinary Level Examination. Along with officials from the Department of Examinations, a parent of one of the patients sat outside the room anxiously waiting for his child to return from the examination centre.? ?
We learned that four students sat for the GCE O/L examination last year too and all of them obtained brilliant results. One of the students in fact had been admitted to the Intensive Care Unit at the time of the examination
We learned that four students sat for the GCE O/L examination last year too and all of them obtained brilliant results. One of the students in fact had been admitted to the Intensive Care Unit at the time of the examination. But with a special arrangement with the Department of Examinations the child was able to write the exam while an invigilator from the Department sat with her within the ICU.? ?
How you can help
Stories of such courage and determination are many at CCC House. The good news is that you too can be a part of their story. According to the Management Committee the maintenance of the establishment costs Rupees 1 million per month. CCC House operates completely through the efforts of volunteers. The Manager of CCC House said the facility operates with a bare minimum of staff operating on shifts. This includes a nurse and an assistant who monitor the health of patients at the transit home.? ?
The CCC Foundation now seeks to build the CCC Trust Fund, so that the establishment is ensured sustenance. Cancer could take any one of us. ?When the hospital started they had 800 beds for more than 1,000 patients. Early cancer patients generally have to come for day treatment which usually involves chemo therapy or radiation therapy. However these treatments have come with numerous side effects which patients struggle to cope with. Some of these patients cannot afford to travel or seek accommodation elsewhere or know who to trust. Unfortunately there are lots of people who swindle patients even at these hospitals. Under such circumstances, these day care patients had no option but to stay in corridors, inside the ward, on floors or even chairs, before this facility was built. A cancer patient?s immunity drops significantly during their treatment. A brief cold for us could mean the end of life for a cancer patient. Therefore this was not acceptable but the hospital had no other choice,? Kumarakulasingham explained.? ?
?We want to continue with the same standards. We need about one million rupees each month to continue our services. Lots of people come and give by means of alms-givings which we encourage. But maintenance of the place including janitorial services, security and other utilities require funds. We make sure that they are in a comfortable and hygienic environment,? she added.? ?
There are many ways you can get involved to make a difference at the CCC House, from sponsoring a bed to supporting mental health through CCC Line. The maintenance cost for a bed at the CCC House is a mere Rs.160 per day. Donors are therefore able to choose from packages ranging from one month up to an entire year. You can also support their various fundraisers and also volunteer at the?CCC House.? ?
It?s the season to give and give back. Whether you give time, goods, money or support, the dedicated staff at CCC House will make sure your contributions will make a lasting impact in someone?s life this season. So why not take a little time away from all the festivity and celebration and support the CCC House, where a little goes a long way. Your donation will not only help the continuity of the services at the CCC House but also help improve the survival rate and emotional well-being of cancer patients at the NCI.??

CDB launches e-finance platform to transfer funds through Facebook
	
Citizen?s Development Business Finance - CDB?s revolutionary e-finance platform CDBiNet is using the contemporary role that Facebook plays in people?s current lifestyles to initiate fund transfers.
CDBiNet, the first of its kind e-finance platform in Sri Lanka, very simply allows any CDBiNet user who has a CDB Savings Account to transfer funds to Facebook friends via Facebook itself and does not need to know any bank account details of the recipient. This fund transfer via Facebook is yet another first for Sri Lanka and further emphasises CDB?s pioneering innovations in using technology as a fundamental advantage for its constantly expanding product and service portfolio. With CDB savings account holders now eligible for this facility, customers gain added convenience for their financial operations.
Fund transfers via Facebook can be at present from a desktop/laptop and the recipient (FB Friend) can receive the funds via any mobile device or laptop/desktop that have access to a Facebook account. ?The biggest advantage of the FB transfer is that the receiver does not share individual bank details with the sender, which ensures absolute security and confidentiality of personal details,? explains CDB Emergent Business Information Technology General Manager Imdaad Naguib. ?Having always ensured uncompromised security in all our technological platforms, this revolutionary FB fund transfer too embeds processes and firewalls that assure users of stringent security that will never compromise their personal information. Hence, the recipient will have a unique four-digit alphabetic pass-code to access the transfer.?
The benefits and advantages pertinent to this revolutionising innovation are many. From sending gifts to helping a friend in need or making a donation to a worthy cause, this transfer option is truly a boon to those who don?t want to embarrass the beneficiary by requesting their bank account details. For an existing CDB Savings customer, the CDBiNet FB transfer is simply enacted by logging onto their CDBiNet account, clicking the Facebook Transfer option under Transfers and Payments, indicating the amount to be remitted, keying in the OTP (One Time Password) which is sent to the sender?s mobile and simply clicking ?share? to select the FB recipient. ?A customised message could also be included by the customer,? says Naguib. ?The four digit alphabetic password which is sent to the customer?s mobile must be forwarded to the recipient.? The Facebook user (recipient) could access the funds from any device by clicking on the message on FB Messenger, entering the forwarded pass-code and entering the bank account details for the funds to be credited to.
As Chief Digital Officer and Head Digital Face of Intellect Design Arena Rajesh Kuppuswamy adds: ?The entire concept of money transfers has been revolutionised and reduced to just three steps of logging into the account, choosing the recipient on FB and transferring the funds. At digital face, we continually work to develop products that denote a bank in a pocket - banking convenience anywhere anytime. Our suite of products including unbanked, mass banking, agent banking, microfinance, migrant banking, digital onboarding are designed to meet the digital transformation needs of the banking industry.?

CERT: Beware of social media Samaritans
	
The Principal Information Security Engineer of the Computer Emergency Readiness Team Co-ordination Centre (CERT|CC), Roshan Chandragupta said they had received complaints of several modern methods of cheating or financial scams via Facebook.
He said several incidents had been reported about social media users requesting gullible victims to pay customs duties for the release of gifts sent to them.
?Many use websites such as Facebook, WhatsApp, Viber to connect with 'friends' most of whom were not known to them,? Mr. Chandragupta said and added that some local fake Facebook account holders pretend to be foreigners. ?They send friend requests to other account holders in an attempt to build some kind of rapport and chat, share images and even sent wishes and gifts to these 'friends' with whom they share pain, sorrow and happiness and give advice as well. Shortly thereafter these criminals send boxes containing presents such as electrical items, jewellery saying that some money has been placed in the box to pay Customs clearance fees if necessary,? he said.
Mr. Chandragupta said an SMS saying the Customs Department has received a parcel and would be released after paying its duties and send a local bank account number to pay the tax.
He said according to some complaints, the victims had credited the accounts with Rs.20,000, Rs.30,000, Rs.40,000 and Rs.80,000.
Mr. Chandragupta said after the tax is paid the victim receives a call from a person claiming to be a Customs officer, saying the parcel contains undeclared foreign currency, which is not allowed in parcels and as such that they have been confiscated.
Mr. Chandragupta said no record had been identified in complaints as making such payments after the parcels seized by the Customs.
He requested Facebook users to add limited number of known friends, not to upload confident personnel details and not to accept friend requests by unknown persons and also not to chat with them.
He also requested users to ignore if such messages were received and to cross-check the received customs declaration bill images with the Customs Department to check whether it is genuine.
?Check the international parcel delivery agents? availability with the received delivery agents? images,? he said.
?After several investigations the CERT found out the Facebook cheaters and the bogus Custom officers were from Sri Lanka.
?The delivery officer was also a local person and he used to speak in English accent as foreigner,? he said. (Chaturanga Pradeep)

Commercial Bank tops Interbrand?s ?Best Sri Lankan Brands 2017? ranking
	
?
The Commercial Bank of Ceylon was the highest-ranked private bank in the inaugural ?Best Sri Lankan Brands 2017? ranking announced recently by Interbrand, and was placed fourth overall among the country?s top brands.
Interbrand assigned a value of Rs.20.33 billion to the Commercial Bank brand.
Explaining the methodology of the valuation, Interbrand said: ?There are three key components in all of our valuations: An analysis of the financial performance of the branded products or services, of the role the brand plays in the purchase decision, and the competitive strength of the brand. These are preceded by a decision on segmentation and at the end of the process are brought together to enable the financial value of the brand to be calculated.? One of the most active and vibrant brands in Sri Lanka, Commercial Bank?s brand building efforts maintain a healthy balance between its corporate and product communications and ground level customer engagement events. In addition to traditional media, the bank is very active in social and digital media and customer engagement events, at national and regional level. The bank also has a large number of Sri Lankan migrant customers overseas and continuously engages with them through various events and consumer promotions.
The bank stated that it places heavy emphasis on strategy when formulating marketing plans and brand building activities. Commercial Bank maintains a constant watch over its brand performance and measures it both qualitatively and quantitatively. Parameters such as brand equity and top of mind recall are periodically monitored through research and the key takeouts are taken into account when communications are developed.? This strategic approach has helped the brand to evolve through the years and become one of the strongest brands in the country.
Referring to Commercial Bank of Ceylon, the Interbrand report said: ?Commercial Bank has built a portfolio of solutions for specific customer segments and product needs, including new e-banking products as consumers increasingly move online. Innovation and customer experience have been fundamental drivers of the bank?s recent growth.

DFCC Bank spreads joy and excitement this festive season
	
DFCC Bank has launched a thrilling Christmas light-up to brighten the holiday season in conjunction with a host of exciting discounts on its credit cards and the virtual wallet.
Led by a vision to spread joy during the season and beautify the city of Colombo, DFCC Bank is decorating key areas in the city with breathtaking decorative lighting. The bank has lit up the Galle Face roundabout, which is already being maintained by DFCC, by planting environmentally friendly flora and fauna and the result will be a magical island which will attract people and infuse the holiday mood. DFCC will also be lighting the street that leads to DFCC Bank Head office by decorating it with lights for a visual delight.
Commenting on this initiative to spread joy and happiness, DFCC Bank CEO Lakshman Silva said: ?We are delighted to take on the mantle of spreading the spirit of the season by decorating and lighting up areas in the city.

Do more to attract investors: British HC
	
The Government should take more steps, similar to the ones it took in the budget, to make Sri Lanka an easier place investors to do business and win their confidence, the British High Commissioner said today.
In his Christmas and New Year message to Sri Lankans, High Commissioner James Dauris also said he was encouraged that there would be local government elections in February, next year.
?Lots more women than before are going to be standing ? something for us all to welcome. It is going to be important for the Government to push forward with steps that will move on its Geneva commitments quickly,? he said.
The High Commissioner said they shared the welcome given by Sri Lankans to all the steps taken over the year to help achieve and advance reconciliation between communities.
?It is to the government?s credit that the Right to Information Act came into force, that Sri Lanka again committed itself to advancing reconciliation and accountability at the United Nations, that President Maithripala Sirisena approved the Act establishing the Office of Missing Persons, that it deposited its accession to the Optional Protocol to the Convention Against Torture and that it signed the Ottawa Convention,? he said.
Meanwhile, he said UK?s relationship with Sri Lanka has continued to flourish over the past 12 months.
?The relationship that Sri Lanka and the UK enjoy is long-standing, broad and enduring. We can see this reflected in what we?ve been doing in 2017. Take business for example. British Companies have been winning new business, investing in Sri Lanka and creating new jobs for Sri Lankans,? High Commissioner Dauris said.
He said regardless of our faith, whether we are Christian or Buddhist, Hindu or Muslim, each year Christmas brings us a message based on values that most of us share: a message of peace, joy and new beginnings, of tolerance, community and forgiveness.
?I?m sure you will share my hope that we will see these values prosper in the year ahead, and our communities grow stronger and happier for it. I wish you a joyful Christmas, and success in the coming year,? he said.

Don't relax ban on Asbestos, says Ven. Rathana Thera
	
Parliamentarian Ven. Athuraliye Rathana Thera said today he was opposed to the government?s decision to relax the ban imposed on the use of Asbestos.
Addressing a media briefing on the launch of the national programme ?Seven days of rest in Sri Lanka?, he said the country faced a huge challenge due to the collapse of the local tea industry.
?It is in question whether the ban was imposed because a beetle was detected in a consignment of tea shipped to Russia or because of the decision taken by the government to ban the import of Asbestos from that country. I raised a public awareness programme to ban Asbestos and spoke to the majority of parliamentarians about the ban. We will be compelled to launch a protest campaign if the government sticks to its decision to relax the ban on Asbestos,? the Thera said. (Chaturanga Pradeep)

REUTERS, 20th DECEMBER, 2017-The European Union wants a transition period after Brexit to end no later than the last day of 2020, according to the European Commission?s negotiating directives agreed on Wednesday.
That date, coinciding with the end of the EU?s seven-year budget period and 21 months after Britain departs the EU, had long been expected as the target end point of the transition.
But this was the first official confirmation that it is the goal of the Union?s negotiators.
British Prime Minister Theresa May had sought a transition lasting around two years. EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier, speaking at a news conference after the EU executive had agreed the terms, said the 2020 deadline was logical and would avoid complications in the next 2021-2027 EU budget period.

Addressing a media briefing, he said the students were psychologically affected?after facing the paper and claimed that one student had committed suicide as a result.
?It is a huge injustice to the students who sat for the examination. Moreover, the allocated time for some questions was not sufficient.

Pilots Union hits back at Srilankan Chairman
	
The Pilots Guild of SriLankan Airlines in continuation of the publicized correspondence between the Chairman of the national carrier and the employees of the airlines asserted that their first proposal in the ?restructuring process? is the stepping down of the Board.
The first suggestion for the restructuring process is that we at SriLankan airlines are of the firm belief that you and the management team have proved to be ineffective and unsuitable for the task at hand?, the Chairman of the Pilots guild said in a letter.
In the letter dated December 20th, Ruwan Vithanage the Chairman of the Guild further said that it was the Chairman of the Airline Ajith Dias who had repeatedly contradicted himself in all previous correspondence.
?Having written to all employees of the possibility of the closure of the company, you subsequently proceeded to contradict your own written statement by saying ?we are not going to close this airline?, during an interview. Such statements and contradictions by you as the Chairman of the Board of Directors only serves to further justify the contents of the letter jointly sent by the Unions? the letter said.
Earlier, the Alliance of Unions insisted on the stepping down of the Sri Lankan Airline board citing incompetence and unwarranted benefits accrued by the board. The letter sent to the Chairman Ajith Dias was in response to the communiqu? to the staff of the airline inferred the imminent closure of the Airline. Chairman Dias thereafter hit back at the unions saying that they were contradicting themselves.
Iterating its assertion of incompetence further, the Pilots said that Dias had caused damage to the Airline by his statements.
?Our stance of No-confidence in your board is also further substantiated by the significant defamation and commercial damages caused to our Airline, due to your statement. By your first communiqu?, you have not only given notice to the employees of closure by also notice to our loyal passengers that Srilankan may no longer exist after March? It said adding that service providers, employee confidence have ebbed as a result of the statements.
The letter hitting back at the representation by Dias that there was assurance by the Unions to support the process of restructure initially, said that there was no restructuring process presented for such assurances presented at the meeting held on December 6.
?We wish to state that there was no restructuring plan presented or discussed with us ( during the 6th December meeting). Therefore, your claims of our confirmation and assurance to make it a success are unsubstantiated as thre was no requirement or opportunity for us to provide the same? the letter said.

PM delays UNP LG nomination list for Kolonnawa UC
	
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe had advised the UNP hierarchy to temporarily put on hold the handing over of the party?s nomination list for the Kolonnawa Urban Council, party sources said yesterday.
The source said the party leader had given this instruction as a result of the controversy that had taken place after the nomination given to Mrs Sumana Premachandra, wife of late Presidential Advisor Baratha Lakshman Premachandra and mother of MP Hirunika Premachandra was found to have been erased using tippex.
The news of the wilful removal of Mrs Premachandra's name had raised eyebrows in the UNP headquarters "Sirikotha".
These sources said it was likely that Mrs Premachandra?s name would be re-instated in the list as the party leader, General Secretary Kabir Hashim and Assistant Leader Ravi Karunanayake were all in favour of the nomination given to her.
However, it was reported that a certain UNP Colombo District MP was opposed to fielding her as a candidate. The matter is expected to be resolved today. (Yohan Perera)

REUTERS, 320th DECEMBER, 2017- Saudi air defenses shot down a ballistic missile fired by Yemen?s Houthi group towards Riyadh on Tuesday, the Saudi-led coalition said, in an attack that could escalate a proxy war between the kingdom and Iran.
There were no reports of casualties or damage. In contrast, a U.N. human rights spokesman said coalition air strikes had killed at least 136 non-combatants in war-torn Yemen since Dec. 6.
The Iran-aligned Houthi movement said it had aimed the missile at the Saudi royal court at al-Yamama palace, where a meeting of Saudi leaders was under way. It described the attack as a new chapter in the conflict.
The Saudi-led coalition said the missile, the latest of several fired towards Riyadh, had been directed at residential areas and there had been no damage.
Quoting a statement from the coalition, Saudi state news agency SPA said Iranian-made missiles were a threat to regional and international security.?

Trump victory must wait a day
	
?
Republican leaders in Congress have been left with egg on their faces after the final approval of a key tax measure was delayed by a procedural gaffe - denying US President Donald Trump his first major legislative victory until at least Wednesday.??
The compromise proposal, forged by congressional negotiators from differing versions passed by both chambers in recent weeks, is still expected to pass with minor changes.??
The initial version was approved Tuesday afternoon by the House of Representatives. But the discovery of provisions in the text that violate Senate?s own parliamentary rules forced the upper chamber to strike those sections deemed ?extraneous? from the 500-page bill.??
The Senate vote on the latest version was still expected late Tuesday, but the House must now act on the revised text, which lowers the corporate income tax and trims rates for individuals.??
House leaders were now planning a Wednesday vote, which would send the measure to the White House for Trump to sign into law.??
Nancy Pelosi, leader of the left-leaning opposition Democrats in the House, had already condemned the tax measure Tuesday as an ?all-out looting of America,? and after the parliamentary bungle she decried it as ?shoddily written? and full of ?hidden loopholes and giveaways.???
In Tuesday?s vote, the House passed the legislation 227 to 203. None of the Democratic minority supported it, while 12 members of the conservative Republican majority voted no.??
Trump, who took office in January but has found legislative victories elusive despite Republican majorities in Congress, supports the tax measure. Before the procedural problem in the Senate became public, he tweeted congratulations to the ?great House Republicans who voted in favour of cutting your taxes!???

Almost 870,000 Rohingya fled there, about 660,000 of whom arrived after Aug. 25, when Rohingya militants attacked security posts and the Myanmar army launched a counter-offensive. ?The Myanmar military has been trying to uproot Rohingya Muslim community from their homeland and for that they persecuted them, set fire to their homes, villages, raped and abused women and killed them,?

UN human rights chief will not seek a second term
	
The United Nations high commissioner for human rights, who has openly criticized powerful governments, including the Trump administration, has made the unusual decision to not seek a second four-year term, saying it ?might involve bending a knee in supplication.?, the New York Times reported yesterday.
The decision by the official, Zeid Ra?ad al-Hussein, a Jordanian prince and former diplomat, was conveyed in a short statement that was emailed to his staff early Wednesday and shared with The New York Times. His four-year term expires next September.
?After reflection, I have decided not to seek a second four-year term,? he wrote. ?To do so, in the current geopolitical context, might involve bending a knee in supplication; muting a statement of advocacy; lessening the independence and integrity of my voice ? which is your voice.?
Most United Nations officials serve as long as their mandate allows. Of the previous human rights chiefs, not one has served a full four-year second term.
It has been unclear for months whether Mr. al-Hussein?s boss, Secretary General Ant?nio Guterres, would support him in seeking a second term or whether the five veto-wielding permanent members of the United Nations Security Council would use their influence to block it. Mr. al-Hussein has been critical of all of them.
He has been outspoken about the Russian-backed government of Syria. He has warned of the prospects of genocide by the Chinese-backed government of Myanmar. And he has called out the Trump administration several times, most pointedly on the travel ban against citizens of Muslim-majority countries and after the demonstrations by white supremacists in Charlottesville, Va.
?Zeid has done a very impressive job,? said Harold Hongju Koh, a professor of international law at Yale Law School. ?He?s operated in a very difficult environment and hasn?t hesitated to speak on very difficult issues.?
Mr. al-Hussein?s willingness to take on the powerful by name, along with what he has described as the ?eye-watering stupidity? of abusive governments, made him few friends.
In his email to his staff, he said, ?There are many months ahead of us: months of struggle, perhaps, and even grief ? because although the past year has been arduous for many of us, it has been appalling for many of the people we serve.?
St?phane Dujarric, a spokesman for Mr. Guterres, confirmed Mr. al-Hussein?s plans to leave after his term expires.
?The high commissioner informed the secretary general last week of his intention not to seek another term,? Mr. Dujarric said. ?The high commissioner has always enjoyed the full support of the secretary general.?
Mr. al-Hussein proved confounding to many by defying classification: the first human rights chief from the Middle East but a sharp critic of violations by Arab governments; a Muslim who condemned Islamic militants; and a Jordanian prince who discarded his title to take the job and become an advocate for victims.
?Even more than his predecessors, Zeid fully embraced the role of U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights as ?conscience for the world,? eloquently using his voice to become ?a sort of nightmare? for dictators, demagogues, and anti-democratic foes,? said Felice Gaer, director of the Jacob Blaustein Institute for the Advancement of Human Rights, in New York.

The ?National Action Plan for the Protection and Promotion of Human Rights 2017 - 2021 (NHRAP) was launched last month at the Parliamentary complex. The five-year plan focuses on the key areas namely; civil, social, cultural, labour, environment, economic and political rights, prevention of torture and the rights of women, children, internally displaced persons, returning refugees, migrant workers and persons with disabilities.? ?
A Cabinet appointed Inter-Ministerial Committee spearheaded the National Action Plan. Government, civil society organizations, the National Human Rights Commission, United Nations agencies, INGOs and academics have been consulted in the formulation of the National Action Plan. While this Plan is commended for the inclusion of progressive activities in relation to promoting human rights it remains a question as to whether the Plan would be translated into reality.? ?
At the 69th commemoration of the International Human Rights Day held at the Lakshman Kadirgamar Institute and organized by ?Right to Life- Human Rights Center?, civil society groups and independent commissions expressed their views on the NHRAP and the status of human rights in the country at present.
A special unit within NPC for complaints on torture
-Prabath Lakshman Wijetunga
Director Public Complaint Investigation Department of the National Police Commission
To the surprise of the audience Director Public Complaint Investigation Department of the National Police Commission Prabath Lakshman Wijetunga, said that it was the invitation from ?Right to Life? to attend the commemoration that presented an opportunity to inform the NPC of the National Action Plan. According to him some Government institutions were still not aware of the NHRAP.? ?
Meanwhile the NHRAP states that a special unit will be established within the NPC to record, investigate, take disciplinary action and refer for prosecution complaints on torture. Wijetunga said that work on this has already commenced.? ?
Under Article 155, as amended by the 19th Amendment, the NPC can establish procedures to entertain and investigate public complaints made against a police officer or the police service and provide redress as provided by law. ?If we find a police officer guilty we take disciplinary action against that individual,? he said.? ?
When investigating into complaints on torture we have found that most victims had been involved in the illegal drug trade. Sometimes the complainant does not cooperate
Since the establishment of the NPC on 14 October, 2015 it has received 467 complaints in 2015, 1879 in 2016 and around 1400 so far in 2017. ?We have taken disciplinary action against 76 police officers. Preliminary investigations have been initiated against 25 police officers,? said Wijetunga.? ?
He assured that as soon as they received a complaint on torture they had acted promptly. ?We go to the police station where it is alleged that the torture took place and inspect the place. We inquire into how the person was arrested,? he said.? ?
Under the Torture Act, torture can be either physical or psychological, he said. ?A person who has been subjected to torture will be removed immediately and hospitalized. We have the power to extract statements and investigate into such allegations.? ?
?When investigating into complaints on torture we have found that most victims had been involved in the illegal drug trade. Sometimes the complainant does not cooperate.?
This is because they want to continue with the trade and they believe that an investigation would impede their opportunity of reassuming the trade. Then we are helpless because we can?t proceed with investigations,? he said.? ?
Chapter on economic, social and cultural rights is weak
-Dr. Deepika Udagama
Chairperson of the Human Rights Commission(HRC)
Chairperson of the Human Rights Commission(HRC), Dr. Deepika Udagama stressed that many activities in the National Action Plan were progressive. However, she admitted that the chapter on economic, social and cultural rights was weak. ?But plans about women?s rights, torture, civil and political rights are very strong,? she said.? ?
??Most of these areas in the NHRAP will fall under the eight thematic sub committees under the HRC. For instance, there are committees for women?s rights, ESC rights, torture etc. Every committee comprises Human Rights Commissioners and civil societies,? she explained.? ?
?We don?t know what happened to the previous National Action Plan. We hope that the 2017-2021 Action Plan will not share the same fate as that of its predecessor. It is the responsibility of the citizens to ensure this,? she said.? ?
Dr.Udagama said that there was a great improvement in the state of human rights in the country. However, she highlighted the inexplicable delays in certain matters such as ending impunity.? ?
She further observed that the silence of the wise and just was detrimental to a democracy.?
?You can?t just vote and stay aside. No democracy has been strengthened in this manner,? she observed.
NHRAP must be more accessible to people at large
-Dr. Paikiasothy Saravanamuttu
Executive Director of the Centre for Policy Alternatives (CPA)
Executive Director of the Centre for Policy Alternatives (CPA), Dr. Paikiasothy Saravanamuttu said that the NHRAP was a reflection of the change that has taken place in the area of human rights in the country since 2015. But he queried as to whether the change has been used to strengthen human rights.? ?
?Have we done our (civil society) bit? Or are we assuming that it is adequate to make plans and pass laws and all we have to do is watch and criticize?? he further quizzed.? ?
?From 2012 onwards we?ve had successive resolutions on this country. These resolutions began almost as appeals to the Government. The very first resolution on Sri Lankan asked to implement the LLRC recommendations. We all contributed towards making that change. Now citizens can?t take a break. They can?t go on holiday. Citizens have to be eternally vigilant. They have to always express their rights, fight for their rights and protect their rights,? he said.? ?
?My appeal is that we have to make this Human Rights Action Plan more accessible to people at large. People need to know what is inside this,? he said.? ?
He said that the Right to Information legislation should be used to ensure that the Government departments, the various ministries and commissions were performing their duties as expected. At a recently held UNESCO conference on Regional Cooperation to Promote Freedom of Expression and the Rule of Law in Asia through Ending Impunity for Crimes against Journalists, the issue on the numerous attacks against the Uthayan newspaper was raised. ?The Minister of Law and Order in response said that he didn?t know about them and asked for a list, and it was given to him. These are the ridiculous things that are happening,? pointed out Dr. Saravanamuttu.? ?
He further explained that transitional justice and constitutional reform go hand in hand. He pointed out that though four mechanism were promised in relation to transitional justice only one mechanism is to be operationalised. ?We are just about to get one (Office on Missing Persons). The others probably not. I think constitutional reform is stuck at the moment,? he said.? ?
?I was secretary to a Task Force on public consultation with regard to reconciliation. We were appointed by the Government. We were asked to find out from the citizens of the country what they thought about the four mechanisms the Government promised in Geneva. How can we go and ask people about the four mechanisms when they don?t know anything about them?,? he asked??
He said that at a private meeting with the President they were told that if transitional justice became the focus, constitutional reform will not take place due to the fear that war heroes will be penalized.? ?
?There are lots of changes that can be made which don?t require a two thirds majority in Parliament or a referendum,? he pointed out.? ?
He stressed that human rights should be upheld for democracy to be preserved. ?We need to establish a culture of human rights,? he said.?

An individual, who allegedly impersonated an O/L student and sat on behalf of him for the examination, had been taken into custody at the examination centre in Wewala, Piliyandala today.
The Police said the arrest was made following a tip-off received from the Deputy Examinations Commissioner.
It is learnt that the individual, who was arrested at noon during the exam, had pasted his picture on the candidate?s identity card in a bid to impersonate him.
The 23-year-old suspect, a resident of Udawalawe, is expected to be produced before the Piliyandala Magistrate today.
The Police had also directed the candidate to be present at the Police station but said he was yet to make an appearance. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)
