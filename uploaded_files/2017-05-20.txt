Cabinet reshuffle is a must: Amaraweera
	
UPFA General Secretary and Minister, Mahinda Amaraweera yesterday stressed the need for a cabinet reshuffle and said if this did not happen, his party would reconsider being in the government.
?A Cabinet reshuffle is a must. It will be done by President Maithripala Sirisena in consultation with Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe. The SLFP is keen to have it carried out as early as possible because all SLFP members, party supporters and the public are expecting it,? he said .
The minister said it was a misconception to believe that the portfolios assigned to the UNP should be reshuffled among its members and those assigned to the SLFP reshuffled among its members.
?There is no such agreement between the SLFP and the UNP. President Sirisena has the constitutional authority to appoint any SLFP or UNP member to any of the portfolios after consulting the Prime Minister," he said adding that the President and the Prime Minister had agreed to a reshuffle and the SLFP was insisting that it be carried out as early as possible.

Constitution making would not be delayed: PM
	
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said yesterday that he had informed Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and other world leaders that the constitution-making process would not be delayed.
He said this at the opening of the new District Secretariat Office in Mannar and underscored the fact that Mr. Modi and other world leaders including Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe had hoped Sri Lanka would resolve the national question through a constitutional process.
"Prime Minister Modi discussed this matter with me, President Maithripala Sirisena, the Leader of the Opposition and with former President Mahinda Rajapaksa. I told Mr Modi that the steering committee of the Constituent Assembly will submit their report within in two months to be followed by enacting the new constitution after discussions," he said. ?We cannot drag the constitution-making process anymore. President Sirisena was elected in 2015 to fulfil this purpose."
He said economic development would include the North as well, when permanent peace was established in the area with a fair proportion of power devolution.
"This is a time when Sri Lankans are commemorating those who died during the armed conflict. Those on both sides of the divide are Sri Lankans. However, the important factor is to ensure that there won't be another war in the future," the Prime Minister said.
Industries and Trade Minister Rishad Bathiudeen said it was important to include the North in the Government's development plans and that the northern people should also enjoy the benefits of GSP plus which the country re-gained yesterday.
Deputy Chairman of Committees, MP Selvam Adaikkalanathan said issues pertaining to resettlement and employment should be addressed by the government. He said President Sirisena has been invited to visit the North on another day other that on the day tha war heroes were being commemorated. (Yohan Perera)

ICTA to carry out security checks on Govt. websites
	
A security audit will be conducted on all Government Websites following the global 'ransomware' attacks, the Information and Communication Technologies Agency (ICTA) said.
It has called for Expressions of Interest (EOI) for this project which would be launched by ICTA with the collaboration of the Sri Lanka Computer Emergency Readiness Team and Co-ordination Centre (CERT/CC) and the Ministry of Telecommunication and Digital Infrastructure.
?The aim of the project is to conduct vulnerability assessments and accessibility tests for all websites of Government organisations. Initially ICTA intends to conduct audits on approximately 120 websites which includes those of Ministries and Departments.
?Website assignments are carried out in three phases. In the first phase, an initial assessment of the Government website would be carried out to identify the possible security issues and to advise the respective organizations on fixing the identified security issue, if any. At the second phase, based on the identified security issues, Government organisations will fix those security issues. At the third phase, follow up audits would be conducted to examine whether the identified security issues have been sufficiently addressed by the relevant organisations,? ICTA said.

President pays glowing tribute to fallen war heroes
	
The motherland was saved from separatist terrorism by non other than our own war heroes as even foreign armies failed to do that in the 30-year civil war in Sri Lanka, President Maithripala Sirisena said yesterday.
We have experienced the repetition of history. Those who criticize the armed forces say there are excessive numbers of personnel in the armed forces and therefore, the strength of the armed forces must be reduced. But the government has no intention whatsoever to weaken the armed forces. Instead, the government would further build up the armed forces, President Sirisena emphasized.
Addressing the nation at the National War Heroes Memorial Ceremony 2017 at the Parliament Grounds last afternoon, President Sirisena went onto say that Sri Lanka was unprepared for a separatist terrorism when trouble started in the mid 70s.
?There was smooth running of the country sans any significant economic or national security hiccups until 1970 after gaining independence in 1948. Though there were occasional failures and setbacks, our armed forces, the Police and Civil Defence Force fought the separatist war bravely and with utmost dedication and resolve until the final victory. Even about 100,000 Indian soldiers of the Indian Peace Keeping Force were not able to contain the LTTE terrorists. However, the sons and daughters of the three armed forces and the Police of the motherland were able to annihilate the separatist terrorism from its soil for ever by using their experience in the war, strategies and knowledge combined with technological acumen,? President Sirisena said.
They faced many a hardship, threats and difficulties in their fight against terrorism. Hundreds of thousands of heroic soldiers made the supreme sacrifice in the war front on behalf of the motherland. Many others lost their limbs in the war and today they live as disabled soldiers in their own homes of welfare centers maintained by the armed forces. The number of civilians and armed forces personnel and members of the Police and Civil Defence Force who became victims of terrorist exceeds 100,000. There were soldiers who were killed by the terrorists directly and innocent civilians who perished to bomb attacks in towns and villages in remote areas that were the targets of the LTTE.
President Sirisena said incumbent government under him as well as the previous government for the last 8 years had done much for the welfare of the soldiers and Police personnel as well as families of fallen war heroes and disabled soldiers by way of providing houses, increasing their salaries and pensions, payments and compensations. The government is also determined to provide a house for each and every soldier.
Commenting on the performance of the armed forces in peace time, President Sirisena said the armed forces personnel have contributed immensely for disaster relief efforts and also to combat narcotics.
The service rendered by the armed forces during natural disasters took place in the Salawa inferno, the collapse of the Meetotamulla garbage dump and Aranayaka earth slip is extremely commendable. They have also helped in a big way to detect large stocks of drugs. In addition, armed forces personnel are involved in national development in many ways, he said.
We cannot find credible information on the defeats and victories in the prehistoric era of Sri Lanka and how we fought foreign domination and invasions before the arrival of Portuguese in 5005. But we have a written history on how we faced foreign invasions from 5005 to 1948. We have very colourful and vivid accounts of the struggles carried out by our courageous and proud forefathers against foreign invaders.
However, the most cruel, most barbaric and most heinous and most damaging act against the nation was separatist terrorism waged by the LTTE. That is why we are paying our gratitude, honour and appreciation to fallen war heroes who made their supreme sacrifice to save the nation and country from terrorism. The country and nation are indebted to them for ever for this, President Sirisena stressed.
While paying his personal honour and tribute to fallen war heroes, President Sirisena also paid his gratitude and appreciation to their parents and added the nation was indebted to them for ever.
Chairperson of the National Ranaviru Seva Authority, Anoma Fonseka made the welcome address. (Sandun A Jayasekera)

Prompt action against unauthorized buildings: Ministry
	
In the wake of the collapse seven-storey building in Wellawatta on Thursday, the Megapolis and Western Development Ministry assured legal action would be taken against all substandard and unauthorized constructions in Colombo.
It said initially, action would be taken against the unauthorized constructions alongside the canals in Wellawatte.
Subsequently, some 1,800 constructions in Wellawatta and Bambalapitiya identified as substandard and unauthorized will be screened for gross violations of construction procedures and stern actions will be taken against the owners.
Addressing a news conference held at the Ministry, Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka said they had launched a sample survey in February 2017 to list out unauthorized constructions in Colombo.
?This survey will be expanded beyond Colombo with the assistance of the Statistics Department. So far, we have identified about 10,000 substandard structures which had mushroomed in Dehiwala, Mt. Lavinia and Kolonnawa as a result of unplanned urbanization. Action will be taken against the owners. Some of the buildings may have to be demolished while some others may be fined,? he said.
Meanwhile, commenting on Thursday?s building collapse in Wellawatta where one person was killed and more than 20 injured. The minister said a structural failure had caused the tragedy.
He said the owner had obtained approval for the plan from the Colombo Municipal Council for a housing complex to be built on this land in 2009 but had not obtained a Certificate of Compliance prior to occupying the building.
?To obtain a Certificate of Compliance, the standard of the building should be evaluated by a team of technical experts. This had not been done for this housing complex. Against this backdrop, the owner had started constructing another building adjacent to the housing complex on a section of the canal reservation land without approval from the authorities. This was the building which collapsed,? the minister said.
He said they had written to the IGP urging action against the building owner under the Penal Code on the basis that a valuable life had already been lost in this tragedy.
The minister said the incident was an eye opener to expedite action against unauthorized and substandard constructions in the country and highlighted the need for an effective and rapid legal procedure to take action against the owners of these building constructions. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

Trump denies asking Comey to back off investigation into Flynn
	
?
By Sari Horwitz, Ashley Parker, Ed O?Keefe, (c) 2017, The Washington Post ? May 19, 2017 - ??
WASHINGTON -?
President Donald Trump on Thursday said there was no collusion between his campaign and Russia, while adding the caveat that he can only speak for himself, and denied ever asking FBI Director James Comey to back off his agency?s investigation into former national security adviser Michael Flynn. ??
Trump spoke in the wake of Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein?s decision to appoint a special counsel to investigate any coordination between Trump associates and Russian officials. ?
?
?I respect the move, but the entire thing has been a witch hunt, and there is no collusion between - certainly myself and my campaign, but I can only speak for myself and the Russians. Zero,? Trump said, at a joint news conference Thursday afternoon with President Juan Manuel Santos of Colombia. ?Believe me, there?s no collusion.? ??
Asked whether he urged Comey - as the fired FBI chief said he did in notes written after a meeting with the president - to drop the Flynn investigation, Trump said, ?No, no,? before ordering the media to move on to the ?next question.? ?
Also Thursday afternoon, Rosenstein went to Capitol Hill and indicated to the full Senate that the White House?s initial account of Comey?s firing was not accurate because he said he knew that Comey would be fired before he wrote a controversial memo that the White House initially used as its justification for the dismissal. ?
Rosenstein did, however, emphasize to the senators the independent authority that the new special counsel has in the Russian investigation. ? ??

Turkey calls for ouster of Obama-era US envoy

By Kareem, Fahim (c) 2017, The Washington Post ? ? ? May 19, 2017 - ??
ISTANBUL - Turkey?s foreign minister on Thursday called on the Trump administration to replace its envoy to the anti-Islamic State coalition - the latest sign of Turkish frustration with the U.S. war strategy in Syria amid mounting tensions between the two NATO allies. ?
Turkey has forcefully protested the Trump administration?s decision to arm a Syrian Kurdish force for an assault on the Islamic State-held city of Raqqa. Turkey regards the force as an arm of the Kurdistan Workers? Party, or PKK, which Ankara and Washington have both listed as a terrorist group. ?
In an interview with Turkish broadcaster NTV, Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu accused U.S. envoy Brett McGurk of ?providing support? for the PKK and the Syrian Kurdish force, known as the People?s Protection Units, or YPG. ?It would be beneficial for this person to change,? Cavusoglu said. ?

US launches rare strike against pro-govt. forces in Syria
	
?
?(c) 2017, The Washington Post ? Missy Ryan ? NATIONAL, WORLD, POLITICS, MIDDLE-EAST ? May 19, 2017 - American aircraft struck a convoy of troops loyal to Syrian President Bashar Assad on Thursday, in a rare direct assault by the United States on forces affiliated with the Syrian government. ?
Assad?s government had no immediate response to the incident, which occurred in far southern Syria near an area where American Special Operations forces are working with local fighters. ??
A defence official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss details of an overseas operation, said that U.S. aircraft struck a convoy of several dozen vehicles, including a small number of tanks, that were advancing toward a U.S.-occupied garrison in Tanf, along the Syria-Iraq border. ??
?This action was taken after apparent Russian attempts to dissuade Syrian pro-regime movement south towards [Tanf] were unsuccessful,? a Pentagon statement said. ??
U.S. officials said the vehicles were slowly advancing within a 30-mile ground and air exclusion zone that the United States has established around Tanf. ??
Before the attack, the aircraft conducted a show of force by flying by the convoy and fired warning shots, the official said. The Syrian fighters ?did not choose to turn away,? the official said. ?

Who risks the most: Authors or publishers?
	
?
?The book business isn?t easy for anyone right now
	?An unhealthy marketplace for books because of Amazon?s dominance
	?It is increasingly difficult for them to make a decent living
	?In Sri Lanka, the relationship between authors and publishers has never been clear-cut
?
While Sri Lankan authors have always had a tough time with their publishers, their counterparts in the UK and the US too face hardships, though for different reasons altogether.?
In an open letter to Britain?s publishers, the Society of Authors said a recent survey found that the median income of a professional author stands at 11,000 pounds today. It added that only a mere 11.5% of British writers make a living by writing only. Many others engage in various other jobs. Some established writers even seek financial assistance.?
?
It is a daunting landscape, far more savage and hostile to the author than any we have seen before
?
In the US, the Authors Guild said the median income for members has plummeted 24% in five years as a result of piracy, Amazon and publishers? cost-cutting. The median income for an American author in 2014 was $8,000. Some 56 per cent of American writers declared they earned less than the $11,670 estimated in 2014 to have been the minimum income needed by a one-person American household. ?Philip Pullman, author of the bestselling ?His Dark Materials? and UK Authors Guild President, declared bluntly: ?From our positions as individual creators, whether of fiction or non-fiction, we see a landscape occupied by several large interests, some of them amassing profits in billions, some displaying a questionable attitude to paying tax and some others colonising the internet with projects whose reach is limitless and attitude to creators? rights roughly that of the steamroller to the ant.?
?It is a daunting landscape, far more savage and hostile to the author than any we have seen before. But one thing hasn?t changed, which is ignored, unacknowledged but complete dependence of those great interests on us and on our talents and the work we do in the quiet of our solitude. They have enormous financial and political clout, but no creative power whatsoever. Whether we are poets, historians, writers of cookery books, novelists or travel writers, we originate the material they exploit.??
?
Several Gratiaen winners have told this writer how they must do the rounds of various Colombo bookshops to collect money summing to a few thousand rupees
?
The society would like authors to receive at least 50 per cent of e-book revenue, rather than half, 25 per cent. They ask publishers not to discriminate the writers who are deprived of powerful agents.?
The Authors Guild letter added: ?Some publishers are excellent, but we see many inequitable contracts. Without serious contract reforms, the professional author will become an endangered species and the publishers ? as well as the society at large ? will be left with less and less quality content. Unless publishers treat their authors more equitably, the decline in the number of full-time writers could have serious implications for the girth breadth and quality of content that drives economic success and cultural reputation of our creative industries in the UK.??
Daniel Hahn, author, translator and chair of the society?s management committee said: ?I understand the book business isn?t easy for anyone right now ? well, nearly anybody ? and that plenty of good publishers are struggling too. But today, we?ve reached a point where the professional author is under serious threat, and that?s not a state of affairs that is good for any of us ? not for publishers, not for writers, and certainly not for readers and the wider culture. We must not allow ourselves to drift into a situation where only the already-wealthy can afford to be writers, and so it?s time to re-balance the scales a little.??
In the US, the publishing industry claims dominance by Amazon has forced it into a corner. US Authors Guild Executive Director Mary Rasenberger said: ?First, we have an unhealthy marketplace for books because of Amazon?s dominance of the US book market. Thousands of bookstores have closed as are unable to compete with Amazon. Many readers can only find books they want through Amazon? the ?pure click? business has forced publishers to accept terms it dictates, often unhealthy. Realising that a publisher cannot survive without Amazon in today?s world, the business capitalises by forcing them to accept unfair terms and conditions. The publishers then pass on the losses incurred as a result of Amazon?s tactics to its authors.??
She went on to add that there was no rational justification, however, for publishers to give a 25% royalty to e-books, when they cost much less to produce than the traditional print version. ?The US Authors Guild, backed by a group of high-profile authors headed by Douglas Preston, has called on the US Justice Department to investigate Amazon.?
Richard Mollet, Chief Executive of the UK Publishers Association, said while publishers share the frustration of the author community that it is increasingly difficult for them to make a decent living, the principal source of this problem lies not in contractual relations between the publisher and author in deeper market factors.?
In an increasingly polarised Western book market, the top ten per cent of authors took 58 per cent of all earning made by professional authors in 2013. The top five per cent who make more than 100,000 pounds a year took 42.3 per cent of all earnings.?
A record number of UK authors have applied for emergency financial assistance. The Society?s Chief Executive Nicola Solomon said: ?There are more worthy applicants. These are people whom you might call ?proper writers,? who have made a living out of writing in their entire career. They are not people who once wrote a poem. It is depressing to see the dilemma they are trapped in.??
?Publishers are less willing to take risks, focusing on series and writers who have become brands, so the midlist is suffering terribly,? Solomon added, ?People who could get a decent advance for a book that would earn steady sales aren?t getting the support they used to, they are being dropped after one or two titles.??
This spells big trouble for writers who are approaching the end of their careers as many publishers do not want to let authors assume control when books go out of print. Solomon says: ?Publishers are demanding all the rights and then hanging on to them, fearing that some new platform for exploiting them is just around the corner.??
In Sri Lanka, the relationship between authors and publishers has never been clear-cut. Royalties are unheard of, and ?advances? for books are usually given on the basis of personal preferences. An author who has an established, long-term association with a big name publisher may ask for an advance in case of a wedding or similar personal matter. Then, he or she will write a book to pay off that advance, which in fact is a loan. ?Publishers are usually miserly in their payments made on the basis of sales. Several Gratiaen winners have told this writer how they must do the rounds of various Colombo bookshops to collect money summing to a few thousand rupees, the equivalent of a grocery bill.?
Some writers, especially in the Sinhala medium, make astonishing claims about book sales and how much they make. They remain to be verified. Those who find the means resort to self-publishing. Some, including a few poets, have successfully used the public domain, facebook, as a sales interface. As yet, Sri Lankan writers face no big threat from the internet. The biggest danger is presented by publishers, who are generally unprofessional and often unscrupulous.?
