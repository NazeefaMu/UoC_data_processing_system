Attempts to create rifts within Buddhist chapters to be probed: PM
	
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said yesterday that the government would appoint a presidential commission to investigate whether anyone had tried to create schisms within the various Buddhist chapters.
He said so at a religious ceremony at Kadigamuwa Raja Maha Vihare.
"We will appoint a presidential commission to determine whether anyone tried to create divisions within the Malwatte Chapter," he said.
?A person could be stripped of his civic rights if he is found to have worked towards a division within the chapters of the Maha Sangha." he said.
He said he had suggested a clause in the proposed new constitution to prohibit the division within the Sangha chapters and to make such an act as an offence. (Yohan Perera)

Court refuses to issue notice to 11 Joint Opp. MPs
	
The Colombo Fort Magistrate today refused to issue notice to 11 Joint Opposition Parliamentarians for allegedly disobeying a court order and continuing a protest against the Central Bank Governor near the Regal Cinema.
The police requested the court to issue the MPs? notice via the Speaker of parliament, stating that the 11 MPs had allegedly disobeyed court order and continued the protest.
Magistrate Lanka Jayaratne observed that the court order was not handed over to the protestors by the police as directed by the Criminal Procedure Code, therefore she refused to issue notice.
She also said the police had no obstacles to take actions if something unlawful was reported during the protest.
The Magistrate also directed the court registrar to send letters of advice to media organizations who had falsely published stories stating the court had issued notice to the 11 parliamentarians. (Shehan Chamika Silva)

Is Paada Yathra targeted at forming family rule? Ruwan
	
The joint opposition?s Paada Yathra was not in any manner a challenge to the government and the only question the government had to ask was whether their attempt was targeted at a comeback to form a family rule again, Defence State Minister Ruwan Wijewardene said yesterday.
He told the media during a spectacle distribution ceremony for school children held at the Bandaranaike Vidyalaya in Gampaha, that it was in question what the joint opposition?s Paada Yathra was meant for.
?Today the UNP, the SLFP and several minor political parties have joined hands to form a national government to resolve the national issues while providing relief to the people. The individuals who stage Paada Yathra today have an inglorious history of leading the people astray through similar means to gain cheap political mileage. We witnessed the popular campaigns too in the past to regain their rights and how they were suppressed. Three people who were killed in the Ratupaswala protest against contamination of drinking water. A young man was killed in a police shooting during a protest in Katunayake FTZ and a fisherman in Chilaw during a protest demanding the fuel subsidy. We were subjected to attacks when in opposition and even our vehicles were damaged. Today, the government has restored democracy and one is at liberty to express views without fear. Former President said that we are obstructing the Paada Yathra. They have the freedom to carry on the march subject to Court orders. However, our question is what purpose would it serve? he said.
The State Minister further said President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe were motivated by one thing and one thing only; to bring about an unprecedented development and prosperity to the people. (Tilakaratne Dissanayake)

Killing of aid workers: HRW says no action taken
	
Sri Lankan authorities have not brought to justice those responsible for the slaying of 17 aid workers a decade ago this week, Human Right Watch (HRW) said today.
On August 4, 2006, gunmen murdered local staff members from the Paris-based Action Contre La Faim (Action Against Hunger, ACF) at their compound in the town of Muttur, in eastern Trincomalee district.
The special court being set up by the government of President Maithripala Sirisena should ensure that the ACF killings and other wartime atrocities are fully and fairly tried with significant foreign involvement, and all those culpable brought to account, regardless of rank or position, Human Rights Watch said.
?The failure to provide justice for the ACF massacre is Exhibit A in the breakdown of accountability for serious crimes during Sri Lanka?s civil war,? said James Ross, legal and policy director at Human Rights Watch. ?The mishandling of the ACF case shows why a war crimes court needs international involvement to shield it from political pressures.?
The killings of the ACF workers ? 16 ethnic Tamils, including four women, and one Muslim ? occurred after several days of fighting between government forces and the separatist Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) for control of Muttur. The ACF team had been providing assistance to survivors of the December 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami. The war ended in May 2009, with the LTTE?s defeat.
The nongovernmental University Teachers for Human Rights (Jaffna) published detailed findings on the Muttur killings based on accounts from witnesses and weapons analysis that implicate government security forces present in the area.
The group alleges that two police constables and Sri Lankan naval Special Forces commandos were directly responsible, and that senior police and justice officials were linked to a cover-up.
In July 2007, then-President Mahinda Rajapaksa established the Presidential Commission of Inquiry to investigate 16 major human rights cases, including the ACF case. Families of ACF workers who testified before the commission reported threats by security force personnel. And the commission?s international monitors resigned in protest in 2008, citing grave problems with its investigations.
The commission?s full report was not released until September 2015, and while stating it had insufficient evidence to determine the perpetrators of the ACF killings, it effectively exonerated the army and navy in the massacre and indicated that LTTE forces or Muslim militia carried them out.
In July 2013, the Rajapaksa government, facing increasing international pressure, directed state lawyers and investigators to review the case and prepare a comprehensive list of witnesses. Little legal action is known to have taken since then, Human Rights Watch said.
The United Nations high commissioner for human rights, Zeid Ra?ad Al Hussein, in his statement at the Human Rights Council in Geneva on June 29, 2016, said that a way for the government ?to quickly build public and international confidence in its determination to pursue accountability, and meet its obligations under international human rights law, would be to achieve successful prosecutions in some of the emblematic human rights cases pending before the courts.? He noted that the ACF case remained in ?summary proceedings,? although the Sirisena government had ?made renewed efforts to facilitate the appearance of witnesses? ? an apparent reference to permitting remote testimony from abroad.
While the Sirisena government has taken important steps to address the serious human rights problems in the country, a number of the commitments made to the Human Rights Council in its October 2015 resolution remain unfulfilled.
Most notably, the government has at times backtracked on its commitment to a judicial mechanism for investigating war crimes and other serious rights abuses by both government forces and the LTTE. The October 2015 resolution specifically calls for the participation of foreign judges, prosecutors, investigators, and defense lawyers, which is crucial to ensure that legal proceedings are protected from local pressures and have the independence that a purely domestic process would lack.
The gap between the government?s formal undertaking to create a tribunal with international involvement and contradictory statements from senior officials has distracted from making real progress on justice issues, Human Rights Watch said. Sirisena has repeatedly said that the justice mechanism will not have foreign judges. However, Foreign Minister Mangala Samaraweera?s statement at the Human Rights Council in June that ?our commitment to the Geneva resolution remains unchanged? and other remarks from officials about the need for support from victims? groups, which back foreign participation, are evidence that the government intends to abide by its pledge.
?The government should honor its international pledge and move forward with a tribunal with foreign judges and other international participation,? Ross said. ?The families of the 17 ACF aid workers and other victims need full confidence in the court to bring about genuine justice.?

Minister alleged to have 45 advisers should explain: Ranjan
	
The ministers do not need to have 45 advisers and if any minister who is alleged to have appointed such a large number should clarify the matter, Deputy Minister Ranjan Ramanayake said on Monday.
He told a media conference that a minister should not appoint a large number of advisers and if anyone of them had appointed such a large number he should come out and reveal the real reason for doing so.
?The present government should not follow in the footsteps of the Rajapaksa regime,? he said.
Responding to a question by a journalist about the allegation that Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe had helped an MP who was said to have obtained a forged passport, he said he was unaware whether it happened or not.
?I don?t think the Prime Minister will encourage the breaking of immigration and emigration laws to help this MP,? the deputy minister said.
He said, however, there was something wrong with the way in which the law was enforced. ?There are many found with forged passports in the Negombo remand prison while an MP who has committed a similar offence is allowed to move about freely.
?In Sri Lanka, those who are accused of corruption are considered heroes while those who fight against corruption are ridiculed. Some insult the parliamentary Committee on Public Enterprises (COPE) Chairman Sunil Handunnetti about his fingers while JVP Leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake is ridiculed over his relationships,? he said.
Responding to another question on the setting up of special courts to deal with corruption, the deputy minister said the committee appointed by President Maithripala Sirisena to look into the matter has decided to fast track the process of setting it up.
Referring to the Paada Yathra, he said it was organized by group of people tainted with fraud and corruption and that paada yatras could not topple the government. (Yohan Perera)

RTI not a law yet
	
The Right to Information (RTI) Bill, though passed in Parliament more than a month ago, is yet to become the law of the country because the authorities concerned are struggling with difficulty to incorporate a certain amendment proposed by the Joint Opposition?s parliamentary group leader Dinesh Gunawardane during its third reading , it is learnt.
The Bill was passed in Parliament on June 24, 2016 unanimously as the government agreed to incorporate amendments put forward by the Opposition.
The Bill, once certified by the Speaker, will provide for the Right of Access to Information, to specify grounds on which access may be denied, to establish the Right to Information Commission, to appoint Information Officers to public authorities and to set out the procedure and for matters connected with it.
In broad terms, people will get the right of access to information which is in the possession, custody or control of a public authority.
However, the Speaker has to sign it into Act for its operation in the country. The final draft has not yet been prepared by incorporating the amendments brought at the last stage in the House.
Secretary General of Parliament Dammika Dissanayake told Daily Mirror the relevant officials would meet today to work out the incorporation of the amendment. He said difficulty had been encountered due to the wording of the amendment to be put into legal format.
He was optimistic that the Speaker would be able to certify the bill and announce it in Parliament next week.
Earlier, the government also said it would take months for the Bill to become fully operative because of time consuming work involved in training information officers. (Kelum Bandara)

We'll bounce back, not to go back again: MR
	
Former President and Kurunegala District MP Mahinda Rajapaksa yesterday vowed to bounce back and not to leave again, assuring to bring his followers to the ?required places?.
Addressing the final day rally of the Jana Satana Paada Yathra at Lipton Circus in Colombo, Mr. Rajapaksa said if the people who followed him are ready, he was also ready for future political agendas.
He also said when the government was alerted that hundred thousands of people were making their way to the streets against the government, instilling fear in the government.
He reiterated that they would not stop their journey even if they were jailed for crimes, which he said were not committed.
?We should clearly say that the fate of previous dictators who ruled various countries of the world, will befall this pair too. There are also many parties that back the dictatorship of this government relying on temporary benefits according to a prepared agenda,? he said.
National Freedom Front (NFF) leader and MP Wimal Weerawansa said some ?sudden construction activities? had been started by the Colombo Municipality, at Hyde Park Grounds where the rally was originally planned to be held.
He also threatened to surround the city of Colombo disrupting the day-to-day activities, if the proposed Economic and Technology Cooperative Agreement (ETCA) is finalized or the proposed Hybrid Court is set up in the country.
Wasudeva Nanayakkara, the President of Lanka Sama Samaja Party (LSSP) criticized the Commissioner of the Colombo Municipal Council for rejecting the request made by them to reserve the Hyde Park Grounds for the rally.
?Where are the people and usual trade activities in Colombo City today? We were successful because we could turn the city of Colombo into a hartal day today,? MP Nanayakkara said. (Piyumi Fonseka)
