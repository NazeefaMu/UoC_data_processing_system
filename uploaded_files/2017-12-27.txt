Will resign, If proved I felled trees at Wilpathu: Range Bandara
	
State Minister of Irrigation Palitha Range Bandara today said he is ready to resign from his post and go out of politics if it is proved that he had felled trees at Wilapthu Wildlife Park.
? Bukalama is a village under the divisional secretariat of Vanathavilluwa. There are 132 needy families living in the area. They have no electricity and other essential facilities. The Government had decided to provide them with these essential facilities. We have not engaged in clearing the forest in the area as alleged by a monk and others,? he said denying the allegation that he is engaged in felling trees in the area.
The State Minister challenged Ven. Pahiyangala Ananda Sagara Thera whom he accused of making false allegations. He also challenged the NGOs in the area to prove that he had been engaged in felling trees. I will give up politics if it is proved that I have felled trees. If they cannot prove, the Venerable Thera should give up his saffron robes,? he said. (Yohan Perera)

## Title: A mid-winter night?s dream with Pradeep

A mid-winter night?s dream with Pradeep
	
Pradeep seated in his listening room
Night is when all sorts of dangers lurk. But there are safe havens. The Reader?s Digest once ran a series of anecdotes called ?Home is where the harm is.? But home is definitely a safe haven at night despite venerable plumbing, wiring and masonry. There is much to do at home for someone who hasn?t cut the umbilical cord with nostalgia. As for possibilities outside, old friend Pradeep Wickremasinghe?s house in Nugegoda tops the list because of a shared interest, and he is very good company within that context, full of anecdotes and a starry-eyed belief that everything will hold until the cows, bats, cats, mice and crows come home.
The best time to visit him is after nine p.m. By then, he has left behind all worldly cares and is busy in his own enviable private paradise ? a large room packed with record players, boxes filled with records, and assorted audio equipment in various stages of resurrection or oblivion.
Remember Lena Zavaroni belting it out: ?Put another nickel in/Turn on the nickelodeon/All I want is having you/And music, music, music!?
Anyone who has listened to the SLBC English Service?s children?s programme will know that tune by heart.
What is referred to as a Nickelodeon in the song is actually a jukebox, a coin-operated music-making machine once common in bars, hotels and restaurants across the US.?
There were quite a few around in Colombo five or six decades ago (What a pity that our museums neglect this type of modern industrial archaeology). Pradeep has in this crowded room what are probably the only surviving nickelodeon jukeboxes in Sri Lanka ? two of them, and he?s forever about to get one of them going.
If he can find the time. He is always trying to get something going in that museum-cum-workshop ? usually a turn table, because its records, records and records (both shellac and vinyl) which have become the obsessive driving force of his life.
His spotlessly clean music room, which is a shrine to a pantheon of singers with their images hanging from walls, and where the bulk of his record collection is kept, is in a different part of the house.
Selecting records out of his precious treasure box of 78 rpm records, Pradeep plays now them on his 1960s Philips portable record player, making me feel like royalty. This compact player?s two rectangular three-watt speakers emit sound with startling depth and clarity. It is the kind of sound quality only to be had from high-end products nowadays. But this machine was a typical middle-class delight back then, not a rich man?s toy.
?
"All these songs have been re-issued in newer formats, and with new music. But give your music lover/connoisseur the choice of a container full of shiny CDs and a single, scratched 78 rpm of the original, it isn?t hard to predict what they?ll go for (Unless it?s a businessperson who?ll sell the CDs and then start hunting for the real thing with the money)."
The arm with its reversible needle (Switch sides, and you can listen to 78 rpm) began sounding scratchy. Pradeep solved the problem within a minute by twisting the arm left and right, the way a practiced physio might relieve the chronic pain of a pulled muscle with a practiced hand. While working, he tells me anecdotes about those who enter this room full of pride and prejudice ? from Police big shots to ministers and businessmen ? and they all leave meek and humbled.
This friendship goes back more than twenty years when I met him at the Piyathilake?s Uyana Record Bar at Lauries? Road, Bambalapitiya. Piyathilake, bearded and always dressed in long-sleeved light hued shirts and dark pants, with his neatly combed hair caressing the back of his shirt collar, always looked dapper. Sadly, he is no more. But the place still exists, run more as an antique and fancy item shop by Piyathilake?s brother though the racks at the entrance are still filled with CDs. Back in the 90s, it was a haven for music lovers, with CDs and cassettes vying for space with compact discs.Musicians, actors and TV personalities dropped in. I remember meeting actor W. Jayasiri and Percy Abeysekara (Flag bearer for the national cricket?
team) there.
It was an eclectic place where I discovered for the first time, in cassette tape format, the songs of Tracy Chapman. When asked for his opinion about something new to you, he?d characteristically purse his lips and raise up his eyebrows --- in other words, high?
praise indeed.
Piyathilake was lazy about recording selections. It took months and sometimes never happened. For selections, you went to Torana, where I used to see the same music-mad technician with his closed eyes and earphones deep into recording trances for more than two decades.
Much earlier, there was Tharanga record bar just a walk away, where the pretty sales girl with her short dress attracted us schoolboys as much as?
the music.
There was U. G. Danny selling records on the pavement at the corner where Lauries Road started, and Raja (Jambuwa) with his fancy brimmed hat and cowboy moustache sat with his assorted items, including books and vinyl records, near the Majestic bakery and hotel. If Piyathilake was dapper, Raja was debonair. He looked as handsome as some of the film and pop stars on those record covers. I hear he?s now running a grocery shop somewhere in Colombo and intend to go and look for him.
Regretfully, I never got acquainted with Danny as Raja was my source for LPs. They and others like them were swept away under the previous regime?s ?city beautification? drive, taking much colour away from that poly-cultural milieu which gave its own unique character to the Bambalapitiya junction. Pradeep tells me that Dannie passed away, but had this snap taken by an?unknown photographer.
U.G. Danny
"There was a tradition of listening to records at home. My parents had an Akai turntable with a small selection of Sinhala, Hindi and English LPs. "
Pradeep remembers Danny aiya telling him that the post card snap would be safer with him, and bartering it for a snack and tea at Pilawoo?s restaurant. History has proved him right. He now shows me several rare LPs of South Indian devotional songs bought from Danny aiya?s stock.
There was a tradition of listening to records at home. My parents had an Akai turntable with a small selection of Sinhala, Hindi and English LPs. But I got really hooked on vinyl records because of Pradeep. Over the years, the collection grew, but there were very few 78 rpms or Sinhala LPs or EPs (45 or 33 1/3 rpm) because these were already beginning to be pricey.
Power can be of many kinds. An executioner wields enormous power over his captives. A messiah too, is in a similar position but in a more elevated manner. In a totally different mood, someone like Pradeep too, wields enormous power ? actually, much more than any executioner or messiah.
There are many of both kinds in this country, but I don?t know of anyone else who has such a stock of Sinhala gramophone records and vinyls. That is mesmeric power indeed, of a very benevolent, Midsummer night?s Dream kind. Though this is now our winter, the music produces a summer?s breezy charm.
Remember how a world-class opera singer was booed at the Galle Face Green because she sang ?Danno Budunge? in an?operatic voice?
?
	There were quite a few around in Colombo five or six decades ago?
	
	
	What a pity that our museums neglect this type of modern industrial archaeology
	
	
	His spotlessly clean music room? is a shrine to a pantheon of singers?
	
	
	Player?s rectangular three-watt speakers emit sound with startling depth and clarity.
	
As I listen to Hubert Rajapkse voice now on a venerable 78 rpm record, it becomes obvious how ignorant people can be. People booed because they are familiar with more recent versions of the song, sung at a lower pitch. Rajapakse sings this high. He?s a really good tenor. One can pitch this song with a minor third or a perfect fifth, and there is a huge difference between the two.
The name of the song is given as ?Dharma Budunge? (Ode to the Sacred City) on this HMV (His Master?s Voice) 78 rpm No. 13103. Next, Pradeep plays a familiar film hit ? ?Me Mosam Manda Sulanga Hama? by H. R. Jothipala and Angeline de Lanarolle (HMV light Green Label, number WN 750), lyrics by Karunaratne Abeysekara and music by P. L. A. Somapala.
Next, we jump to the ?pitthala band era? (As derided by purists) and the last 78 rpm film song record to be produced in the country, from the film Gita in 1970. It is a duet ? ?Dakina Dasune? by H. R. Jothipala and Sujatha Aththanayake (Light green label HG 787). This isn?t stereo, but I?m stunned by the brilliance of the sound ? Jothi?s effortless nuancing of Karunaratne Abeysekara?s precision lyrics which manage very well the literary tight rope act of taking song writing down to the popular cinema hall level (Jothi was very much the ?peechan? singer at the time, loved by the gallery) while keeping the sentiment as fine as it can get.
Add to this Sujatha?s razor sharp vocal rendering, and exuberant instrumentation which includes piano accordion and electric guitar, and I can understand why there are people who beg, plead with or threaten Pradeep to sell them these records. Just to sit there listening is a life-enhancing experience.
But he won?t sell, not these. He?s very much in control of the situation and enjoying himself. This is true power.
I wonder what he?s going to pull out of his coat next ? a rabbit, a pigeon, or the Pink Panther? Now we hear the breathless ice skating vocals of J. A. Milton Perera ? ?Agadha Sagaraye? (light green label HG 756) from the film Dheevarayo. Lyrics again by Karu aiya, and music by that often underestimated wizard Roksami who, if he worked for Indian cinema, would have been a national hero and a millionaire.
?
"But he won?t sell, not these. He?s very much in control of the situation and enjoying himself. This is true power"
Milton?s voice is hard to define ? is it high or low? Is it tenor or barin tone? Sometimes, it?s close to bass. Sometimes, it?s more like Soprano. Whatever it is, it?s always sharp, sharper and throatier than Jothi?s (no offence meant). One can argue that Jothi had a greater range. There is a silky sensuousness to his voice, like Mohammad Rafi?s, ideal for playback singing. Milton too was a very successfully playback singer, but there was more to his voice than that ? a quality which appealed to an inner sense beyond sensuality, talking from the other end to the more civilized side of the beast. This is clearly so even when Milton sings in a ?party mood? as in the song ?Sobha Alankara Muhune?. There is too, a sense of intimacy as if he?s telling you lovely little secrets. Interestingly, while Jothi has one or two imitators who can sound like him, there is no one who can even get close to Milton?s voice except his own son.
But a singer?s popularity isn?t just a matter of his voice. Skinny, malnourished-looking Milton was no match for the chubby, handsome, cheery Jothi with his matinee?
idol?s smile.
All these songs have been re-issued in newer formats, and with new music. But give your music lover/connoisseur the choice of a container full of shiny CDs and a single, scratched 78 rpm of the original, it isn?t hard to predict what they?ll go for (Unless it?s a businessperson who?ll sell the CDs and then start hunting for the real thing with the money).
But it?s getting late, and time to get some sleep, though it looks as if the night is just starting for Pradeep. More exciting musical discoveries at a later date.

A mystery wrapped up in a three-word conundrum!
	
?
Employees of a Ministry handling the subject of trade and commerce often refer to ?two hot seats? during their gossip sessions, they say.
?
According to them, the Ministry Secretary is the occupant of one of these hot seats and the occupant of the other seat is the chairman of a state-run trading undertaking that comes under the Ministry.?
They call their seats ?hot seats? because appointees to these two top posts do not occupy them for more than a few weeks.?
Meanwhile, some inquisitive ones claim that they have unearthed the reason why the appointees to these two posts do not last long;
However, they do not clearly explain the reason. They give it wrapped up in a three- word conundrum:? three percent cut.
The appointees who happily take over these top jobs hastily quit them after a few weeks for fear of falling into hot water, and they remain tight-lipped after quitting for fear of possible repercussions, they say.?

A tribute to Rev. Fr. Mervyn Fernando: A warm and loving human being and eminent scholar
	
?
orn on April 20, 1934, Rev. Fr. Mervyn Fernando entered into eternal rest on December 20, 2017.
He was ordained as a priest on December 21, 1959 by His Eminence Thomas Cardinal Cooray at St. Lucia?s Cathedral, Kotahena and served in priesthood for 58 years.
He was not only a warm and loving human being but also an eminent scholar, award winner, an astronomer and a great lover of nature.
I first met Fr. Mervyn at St. Joseph?s College, Colombo 10, at a series of talks on child development arranged by the college. What Fr. was offering us was not just theory but a truly meaningful approach to understanding and handling the child, an approach that I adopted with each student in my class and which led to my being able to cultivate meaningful relationships with my students to the extent that many of them still continue to keep in touch with me even 35 years later. Such is the success of Father?s work.
I was then appointed student counsellor. However, before my appointment, I followed the counsellor training course first at Aquinas College and later at the Family Studies Services Institute which was based on building the person, leading into total well-being and self- awareness. Raising self-awareness or the task of discovering ?Who I am?, was the base of Fr. Mervyn?s programme which led to a deep level of discovering and understanding oneself and one?s emotions leading to self-discovery and maturity. Upon completing my training I began working with A/L classes adopting his method of ?heart listening?, listening and responding to my students with empathy. My experiences have gone into a handbook that can be used by any teacher even today who wishes to adopt his methodologies.The full six-day life education programme at Subodhi founded by Fr. Mervyn saw much success. Any student who followed the programme will tell you what it meant to them. The strong, challenging, deep, sessions brought out the best in them winding up with an encounter with their parents leading to tears of joy and happiness and an understanding of the ?true love? that their relationships were based on.
While all this was going on the country was struggling with racial and religious problems and working for inter-racial peace was central to his work. With the support of Save the Children, Norway, Subodhi, launched the Rainbow Children?s project in 1996 which brought the children of all races and religions together in a variety of activities across the country. It was Fr. Mervyn?s belief that for a true solution to be found hearts must be healed and mutual trust and goodwill cultivated amongst the communities.
An avid reader of books, I too have been lucky enough to sample some of his prized possessions from his large library which now stands empty as he has distributed to them to public libraries across the country so that all people of all communities can benefit.
A lover of people with no word of judgement or criticism for anyone, Father lived a life of 83 years guided by these words of our Lord,
?May I reflect the glory of the Lord. Let Him shine through my face, my smile, my eyes, my words, my actions; transforming myself and others into his likeness. (2 Corinthians 4:5-6)
His legacy will remain in his scholarly work but most significantly in the hearts and minds of those he has touched. May his soul rest in peace.
Rev. Fr. Mervyn Fernando was the founder of Family Studies Services and Subodhi Institutes of?

BOC?s Kekirawa branch wins GREENS Gold Rating Award
	
The Bank of Ceylon was recently awarded the GREENS Gold Rating at the GBSL Awards Ceremony 2017 organized by the Green Building Council of Sri Lanka with special reference to the bank?s Kekirawa branch building which was built according to eco-friendly standards.?
The award ceremony took place with the participation of the Chairman of the ?World Green Building Council? as the Chief Guest at the Earl?s Regency Hotel, Kandy.? The bank?s Kekirawa branch was refurbished and re-built in early 2017 using minimal environmentally hazardous methods and materials whilst minimizing the cost by recycling and up-cycling materials that were taken from the previous building.? BOC Kekirawa branch was one of the three initial branches to be converted as a Green branch and the other two were Kilinochchi and Thissamaharama branches. Currently BOC maintains twenty branches under ?Green Banking Concept?.
When re-furbishing, the branch?s minimal material usage and use of eco-friendly materials were taken into account and improved to give a better environmental quality. The interior of the Kekirawa branch is designed to let in as much daylight as possible to minimize the usage of electricity during day time whilst using batten type LED bulbs with a specially manufactured diffuser system and at the same time Solar panels were fixed to produce 83 percent of the electricity used by the branch. All necessary fixtures and fittings are environmentally certified. These include air conditioners that have inverter technology, automated fresh air ducting and are CFC free. They measure indoor air quality with?CO2 meters.?
The branch also includes a vertical green garden that helps to maintain a comfortable interior temperature and which refreshes air and improves air quality and uplifts the overall atmosphere. These green gardens are maintained through a supply of rain water whenever possible through the rain water harvesting system that is installed within the branch. Well planned landscaping allowed the branch to save 25 percent of the energy compared to a similar type of base building.?
?Moving forward the Bank has formulated its comprehensive sustainability policy to address strategic placement of procedures and processes to strengthen the triple bottom line: social, economic and environmental pillars. ?Strategic Corporate Social Responsibility is embedded into the Sustainable Policy of the Bank. The strategic implementation of digital transformation that commenced in early 2014 have gradually replaced many of traditional procedures, policies and technologies and has laid down a solid foundation for the Bank to embark on -Green Banking,? stated the General Manager D.M. Gunasekara. The Bank of Ceylon has been engaged in green initiatives such as E- Learning, altering internal systems and processes to be tech-savvy, thereby achieving a minimized carbon footprint, paper recycling and E-waste management apart from maintaining green branches. Engaging the society to walk along with this noble initiative the Bank planted 100,000 trees in line with the bank?s 75th anniversary in 2014 gathering school children and public from all over the country. The Bank continues to maintain these planted trees. BOC was also recognized as the highest financial assistance provider for Solar Power technology, at the ceremony held to mark the generation of 100Mega Watts through renewable energy organized by the Ministry of Power and Energy.?

Colombo could be like Delhi soon
	
Colombo could face air pollution issue like New Delhi soon, Central Environment Trust Director Sajeewa Chamikara said yesterday.
He said that the city of Colombo could face an air pollution issue like New Delhi as a result of increased emissions.
?These emissions remain in the lower atmosphere with the increase of humidity and reduction of temperature as it is experienced these days. Emissions increase as a result of increasing vehicular activity and construction work.
?This situation could get enhanced with the urbanisation and industrialisation. All of these will be accumulated into an air pollution issue like in New Delhi,? he said.
Mr. Chamikara said filling of wetlands for construction could also create more environmental issues.
?Filling of wetlands has become severe in Colombo and suburbs,? he added.
In addition, he said the Port City project had also created some issues.
Among the major issues of the project, he said, was the sea erosion taking place in some areas.
He said there was severe sea erosion in the Bathiyawatte area in Negombo, while coastal areas from Wellawatte to Panadura was also facing increased sea erosion.
?We will fight against the project even after when it is completed,? he said. (Yohan Perera)

Counterparty Risk ? An emerging challenge for banks
	
A robust financial system is necessary to support sustained economic growth. A robust financial system needs an efficient financial intermediation.?
The primary role of financial intermediation vests with a well spread banking network to bring about uniform growth in the economy. Banks obtain deposits from customers to on lend to productive sectors of the economy. Banks pay certain interest on deposits to customers according to product features designed and calibrated within the bank?s policies and Central Bank guidelines.?
They deploy deposit resources in lending and investments after meeting Statutory Reserve Requirements (SRR) currently ruling at 7.5 percent in Sri Lanka. Every country has its own reserve requirements depending on fiscal and banking needs. It is the portion of funds from out of deposits to be kept with the Central bank statutorily.?
The deposit resources after keeping statutory portion of deposits with the Central Bank can be applied for commercial lending or investments depending upon the internal credit and investment policies and prudence of the banks. The deployment policies of the banks are always intended to enhance risk adjusted yield. Therefore, banks would endeavor to target deployment of these deposit resources to obtain best risk adjusted return in the given market to create better stake holder value. Loan products and lending schemes are the outcome of such an effort. The features of deposits and lending schemes undergo changes with changing customer aspirations and technology standards. When schemes are well customized, customers avail these products to meet their commercial/personal requirements.
Integrated risk?
Banks charge interest on loans and obtain yields on investments based on the market movement of interest rates. These interest earnings is the main source of revenue streams of banks. Banks make money from the difference of interest between what they earn on deployment of funds and what they pay to customers on deposits.?
In the process of such financial intermediation, banks are exposed to various risks during their business operations. The major categories of risks are range from credit, market and operational risks. However, the banks are also facing other risks such as liquidity, interest rate, foreign exchange rate, legal, regulatory, reputational etc. All these risks are highly interdependent. The management of such business risks are integrated risk management strategies.?
According to the Central Bank guidelines, the overall risk management should be vested with an independent Integrated Risk Management Committee (IRMC) of the board so that the function is overseen by highest forum of the bank. Given the diversity of balance sheet profile of banks in Sri Lanka, it is neither prudent nor desirable to adopt a uniform framework for management of risks. The architecture of an integrated risk management function should be bank-specific, decided upon the size, complexity of functions, operating environment and technical expertise of staff.?
Counterparty risk?
But among the banking risks, the counterparty risk (CR) is most predominant. Counter party is the other party that participates in a financial transaction, and every transaction? ?must have a counterparty in order for the transaction to go through. More specifically, every buyer of an asset must be assessed in terms of credit worthiness to honor the commitment to repay.
While banks will have to return depositor?s money in time, the failure on the part of counterparty to honour the commitment can lead to uncertainty and risk. In this context, it is essential to build robust systemic control to mitigate such proliferating risks. Therefore, risk management is a complex function, which requires specialized skills and expertise. Data analytical abilities. Internationally, banks have been moving towards the use of sophisticated models for measuring and managing risks in an integrated manner but more important is the internal appraisal system of CR that forms the part of measurement and mitigation of such risk.?
It needs the support of a research team that constantly engages in assessing the various forms of risks and identify methods to mitigate risks. The banks should keep an eye on the performance of various industries and be able to identify risk prone entities to form risk management policies.??
Diversification of risk?
With innovation of products in banking system, dependence on counter party increases. The non-fund based lending products such as issue of bank guarantees and letters of credit (LCs) where there is no immediate flow of funds but if they are invoked by beneficiaries, liability to pay will devolve on the banks.? Counterparty risk gained visibility in the wake of the global financial crisis. In order to help mitigate the risk, the credit rating of individuals and companies assumed greater role in risk assessment. Further innovations in financial markets led to introduction of exotic derivative products in money, equity, bonds and foreign exchange markets such as futures and options, credit default swaps and chain of hedging products.?
Role of rating agencies in diffusing risk?
Globally, rating agencies have gained prominence to help lenders assess credit worthiness and obtain market intelligence to mitigate CR. Like in many advanced and developing financial markets, rating agencies began to provide inputs to financial sector players. With modernization of financial markets, rating agencies made inroads to help banks mitigate CR.?
Besides the international rating agencies, Sri Lanka developed its own rating market. Fitch Ratings Lanka Ltd, Ram Ratings (Lanka) Ltd, Lanka Orix Factors Ltd (LOFAC) and ICRA Lanka Ltd. These professional rating agencies constructively engaged primarily in assessing and evaluating the credit worthiness of listed securities or to be listed securities with particular regard to the issuer?s ability to perform any obligations.?
It gives enough clue for market participants to assess the financial robustness of companies. These professional rating agencies share their views in graded format to lenders. At the same time, banks also develop their own internal rating modules to supplement the reports of external rating agencies to form a final view on the changing dimensions of CR.?
The banks should be able to disseminate the knowledge on perceiving CR, its measurement and nuances of managing them to provide a foolproof financial intermediation that can support and sustain growth aspirations of the economy. It should be a constructive activity to gauze the ecosystem so that banks are well poised to manage and maintain a sustainable track record of risk adjusted returns.?

Crab meal diplomacy pays dividends!
	
?
A VVIP from the land of Malays, who arrived here on an official visit recently checked in to a high-end hotel facing the Galle Face Green for his brief stay.
?
Off his day?s schedule, the distinguished visitor was chatting to Muza, our? ?envoy now serving in his country, when he suddenly expressed his desire to savor some typical local dishes for a change.?
Being a former first citizen of the capital, Muza knew all about each and every eatery in the city like the backyard of his own house and it struck him that the restaurant housed in the old Dutch Hospital building well known for its crab meat dish was the ideal place where he should take the visitor for dinner.
Muza went into action forthwith. He placed an order for a sumptuous dinner with prawn and crab meat as special dishes.?
Later the Malay leader enjoyed the prawn and crab dishes so much that he asked Muza to have the same meal sent to his wife back at the hotel.
The crab meat dinner story did not end there. The Malay leader who called on our Number Two at his official residence the following day made it a point to tell his host how much he enjoyed the delicious crab meat dish the previous night. He also asked our Number One to look into the possibility of opening a branch of this seafood restaurant in the capital of his country.?
The Malay leader reportedly told our Number Two: ?Crab meat is a popular dish in our country too. But the crabs available there are very small compared to the ones served in your country. We welcome both crab and prawn imports from your country ? at least 10 percent of your annual harvest.?
They also spoke in glowing terms about our star cricketers Mahela and Sanga who took the initiative to open this restaurant.
The crab meat dinner hosted to the Malay leader by Muza has already made such big news it is expected to lead to an increase in tourist arrivals from that country, they say.?

Credit Suisse to keep UL flying: Minister
	
While expressing hope that national carrier SriLankan Airlines would not be liquidated, State Minister Lakshman Yapa Abeywardana said the Government had successfully negotiated a long-term credit package of US$ 150 million and a short-term loan facility of US$ 50 million with the Credit Suisse Bank on behalf of the airline.
The Minister added that the loan package of US$ 200 million (Rs. 32 billion) is expected to strengthen the Government?s guarantee for the ongoing discussions with several investors to run the SriLankan as a Public-Private Partnership (PPP).
He said the Government did not intend to liquidate the national carrier under any circumstances but the colossal US$ 702 million (Rs. 108 billion) acts as an obstacle to the successful conclusion of the negotiations.
?The Government has obtained this loan package from the Swiss Bank and the Cabinet has decided to absorb the entire liability of the SriLankan Airlines running to US$ 702 million, which I hope would lead to a successful conclusion of negotiations with prospective investors,? the Minister said.

?Economic crisis?: JO requests early convening of Parliament
	
The Joint Opposition (JO) today requested Speaker Karu Jayasuriya to convene Parliament before the previously scheduled date in January, to find solutions to current ?economic crisis?.
JO leader MP Dinesh Gunawardane said they will write to Speaker on Wednesday itself seeking an early convening of Parliament.
?Today, economic plights are mushrooming. Though there is a finance minister no solution has been made to solve these plights. The Cabinet convenes as usual, but to no avail. It is the Parliament which has the power to make decisions and execute them. Therefore, it should be convened immediately,? he told a news briefing.
Meanwhile, JO National Organiser MP Dullas Alahapperuma said the government?s mismanagement was similar to that of Sri Lanka Cricket.
He said the Sports Minister was unaware of the decisions taken by the Cricket Board.
?There are at least six leaders in the government today but the left hand doesn't know what the right hand is doing. There are three Cabinet spokesmen and all bear different opinions over one and the same issue,? he said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

Two young British film producers were in Sri Lanka recently, putting the finishing touches on a film venture with Sri Lankan film director Louis Van Der Straaten.
Kiran Rai is the executive producer for Parachute, an action film directed by Van Der Straaten, who also scripted the story. Ralph Perera is the main producer.
Sri Lankan-born Ralph Perera migrated to the UK early. Kiran Rai was born in the UK but has his roots in Mumbai, India. He visits India often and now Sri Lanka, too, has become a favourite destination.
Ralph Perera is an investor by profession and says he sees film as a good area for investment.
He has produced documentaries and television films in the UK.
Kiran Rai is a reporter for the London Evening Post, covering sports events such as football and Formula I, and is an aspiring actor.
He says he was delighted when director Van Der Straaten offered him the lead role in his next film venture.
Parachute is a Sinhala language film and will be distributed internationally after being dubbed in English. The producers say it is based on a true story.??

France lends euro 13.9mn for Lankan dairy projects
	
Marking the over 45-year- old development cooperation between Sri Lanka and France, the Government of French Republic agreed to extend its assistance to Sri Lanka by providing a euro 13.9 million (approximately Rs.2,514 million) concessional loan for the implementation of Development of Six Mini Dairies Project.
The proposed project will include complete modernization of the pre-selected six mini dairy cooperative societies and organisations by establishing state-of-the-art equipment chains to produce pasteurized milk and sterilized milk at a capacity of 4,500 litres per day.
The high-quality equipment will allow stable, homogenized and high-quality products with computerized monitoring.
In addition, in order to improve the breeding process, a French non-profitable entity will extend technical assistance to dairy farmers; it will also carry out a proper market survey on the dairy sector of Sri Lanka.
It is also expected that this initiative will support the government?s ambitious target to achieve self-sufficiency in dairy production by 2020 and to contribute to closing the gap between the demand for dairy and local supply.
Finance and Mass Media Ministry Secretary Dr. R.H.S. Samaratunga signed the relevant protocol agreement on behalf of the Government of Sri Lanka and Embassy of France in Sri Lanka Charg?ed? Affaires Isabelle Miscot signed the relevant agreement on behalf of the Government of French Republic today.
Embassy of France in Sri Lanka Economic Counsellor Herv? Sarnelli also participated in this event held at the Finance and Mass Media Ministry.

A gabby Diyawanna member of the JO hailing from Kalutara area the other day called on the chief monk of a Buddhist temple in the area.
?
After placing the basket of fruits he carried on a stool the member went down on his knees and worshipped the monk.?
Asked whether he had any special reason to make this visit, the member said: ?Ehemai, hamuduruwane.?
?What is it, mantrituma??
?I want to make a humble appeal to you, hamuduruwane!?
?What is it??
The member scratched his head and said: ?Hamuduruwane, would you mind withdrawing your candidature in support of our candidate??
The monk looked hard at the member and said: ?I can?t take a decision on my own. I have to consult the party high-ups first.?
?If you withdraw your candidature, our man is sure to win. If he wins, we all will benefit! And I can assure that he will do appropriate justice to you, hamuduruwane, for your sacrifice!? he said.
The monk had finally agreed to withdraw his candidature on the promise of ?justice? being done to him in due course, they say.?

This senior purohita big in stature representing a distant area in the country was partying with a select group of friends recently. Somewhat tipsy, he turned emotional and began pouring out his heart to his companions.
?
He first confided in his pals a few dreams he had cherished as a young man.?
?I had set several targets in life and I achieved some of them exceeding my expectations. I must admit that I failed to achieve some high positions I aspired to.? You may think I am quite happy because of the high political office I am holding now. No, I am not happy! I am disillusioned and disgusted with politics!?
He paused for a few moments for the effect of what he said to sink in and continued in a sad tone: ?Once I cherished the dream of going round the world by car. And I realised that dream! I had another goal in life and I achieved that too. I had the ambition all the time to attain the highest position in the country. And that has gone awry! I have now only one dream to realize. No! No! It?s nothing to do with politics! I have no intention to contest an election again?I want to be a real mogul ? a very rich person!?
A friend interposed: ?Sir, you are already a multi-millionaire!?
The senior purohita guffawed loud. ?Do you say that I am rich? You can?t say that I am rich. Nowadays only a multi-billionaire is considered a rich person!?
?Is it your new ambition, Sir!? a friend asked in amazement.? The purohita nodded assuming a somber expression.

Hathurusingha can?t give any extra advantage to SL: Soumya Sarkar
	
Bangladesh batsman Soumya Sarkar thinks that Sri Lanka Cricket new Head Coach Chandika Hathurusingha can?t give any extra advantage to the Sri Lankan team.
Soumya Sarkar who played a major role in the series victory against Pakistan and South Africa at home is now in a situation of getting dropped from the national team. He was also criticized in Hathurusingha?s era for getting excessive opportunities.
Now as Hathurusingha is gone, Soumya?s fate might change if he doesn?t perform in regular basis. In a recent press conference, Soumya said about his targets for the new year, talked about Sri Lanka and also informed that he will give everything he can to get back in form.
?New Year! Their (Sri Lanka) coach changed, ours will change too. Team plans will be changed too. I want to start the new year well. The result will go on their way who will play well. We will do everything we can to perform well,?he said.
?I think I have to think deep if I start thinking it. He knows a lot about us. He will give everything he can to his team. But giving excessive is a problem too as they can?t take it all and it will be the players who will play, not him. And, we will also have our plans for sure to dominate them. We know about Hathurusingha too. So, we know that what plans he can make.?he said.
?If I wouldn?t have perform well, then I wouldn?t have been in the team and no one would have liked me. If I don?t even get admitted in the school, then how can they like me. For getting admitted into the school, I have to give admission exam. When I did good in my exam, the coach liked me. As simple as that.?he added.(bdcrictime)

A story how Big Vig from the North had to eat humble pie by trying to be too big for his shoes has gone viral in political circles.?
?
Big Vig had made a direct invitation to the Malay leader who was on an official visit here recently to pay a visit to the North.
Surprised by this direct invitation, which amounted to a serious breach of protocol, the Malay Government authorities had informed about it to Sri Lankan Foreign Ministry.?
Following consultations with the Foreign Ministry, the Malay government had informed Big Vig that arrangements could be made for him to call on the Malay leader in Colombo.?
So Big Vig had to come down from his pedestal and call on the Malay leader in Colombo, they say.
Thus, Big Vig had to eat crow by failing in his bid to show the foreign visitor the shortcomings in the North mainly for the purpose of placing the Centre in a bad light, say political observers.?

Among the guests on this occasion was a Blue party purohita who used to aim barbs at the government in public despite being a member of the top team.

Some Green members at the banquet collared the rebel purohita and asked him when he was going to cross the divide.?
The purohita who appeared ill at ease replied tightly: ?Why should we quit? We only tried to unite the two factions?Some family members scuttled all our efforts? They lost power because they were bent on perpetuating a family rule.?
A few days after this event, two members known to be close followers of this purohita crossed over to Pohottuwa. Meanwhile, a rumour said that the purohita was the force behind the defection of the two members.?

If Politicians Divide and Rule: SL can?t heal, reconcile

Human Rights Activist Shreen Abdul Saroor is one of the fifteen activists who has been awarded the Franco-German Prize for Human Rights and the Rule of Law this year. The prize is awarded to dedicated Human Rights defenders from around the world who have done outstanding work in their respective countries to uphold human rights and the rule of law.?
Excerpts:
?
Your family was evicted from Mannar in 1990 by the LTTE. How did this affect your life?
I was in my first year studying Business Administration at the Colombo University when my family was evicted. My father was visiting me in Colombo at that time. I went to Puttalam to receive my mother, siblings and other family members. Mannar is an Island. There were two bridges- a road bridge and a train bridge. The LTTE destroyed both before the eviction. We feel that they destroyed the bridges to make sure that the people didn?t take anything with them. People were allowed only Rs. 500 and were robbed of everything they possessed.
They all had to leave the Mannar Island in crowded fishing boats to Kalpitiya in Puttalam. This incident made me rethink about the LTTE?s liberation struggle, which inspired me as a teenager. There was a feeling of betrayal and difference to the community I thought I belonged to.
?
What inspired you to become?an Activist?
After the eviction, I went with my father to work in Puttalam. It bothered me to see the collective suffering of a once very prosperous community. Besides in refugee camps, I witnessed radicalisation and the initial indications of such religious radicalisation being girls dropping out of school and married off at a very young age and women adapting to Burka and Abaya.
Back home the Northern Muslims were a more secular community prior to our eviction, and we shared cultural practices and social values with the Tamil community.
Lots of women were migrating to Middle Eastern countries from the Puttalam camps because they needed to earn an income. Children were born in these camps and their birth certificates indicated which camp they belonged to. I thought that if justice is to be served to these people they had to return to the North where they belong. They belong nowhere else because they are a liberal group of Muslims with some sharp socio-cultural similarity with the northern Tamils. This is one reason I thought I should do something about the collective return of Northern Muslims.
?
	Women are not considered equal due to personal laws and other laws which are patriarchal and conservative
	
	
	If we don?t reform the MMDA we will be a community living in the stone age
	
	
	Legalise abortion unconditionally
	
?
?
How has your activism affected your family and personal life?
When my family and community came in boats and became paupers overnight they sought refuge in Puttalam. I thought that we should return back to Mannar somehow and soon. However, I lost my father a few months after the eviction and as the eldest, in the family, I had to look after my family. I studied and worked for a private company. After two years of completing my degree, I joined Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA) with the intention of continuing my work in the North.
Some of the women in the camps in Puttalam were agitating because they were given inedible rice as part of their ration. They burnt their ration bags in front of a cooperative shop and that was my first inspiration to look at women?s strength differently. I wanted to continue with the work my father had started. But it took some time because we were also displaced and homeless.
I returned to Mannar in 1998. My mother was very nervous because it was the peak of the war. By that time I was part of CIDA?s Shakti Gender Equality programme and finished my women?s rights post-graduation.
The work I do today encompasses empowering women, especially the women devastated by the war, to speak for themselves.
My family had been very supportive throughout until I openly stepped into the struggle to reform the Muslim Marriage and Divorce Act (MMDA). Community members and distant family relatives have been pressurising my mother. I have been asked to shut my mouth and this pressure comes through mosques and social media. One of the allegations against me right now is that I am a Western agent and getting millions to erase a unique structure that the Muslim community has got through the MMDA. Well, I do not mind any blame being put on me and it will never stop our fight for equal access to justice for Muslim women and girls. It is the right thing to do and there is not going to be a turn back.
?
Let?s talk about the Women?s Action Network (WAN) and the Mannar Women?s Development Federation (MWDF) which you co-founded. How have they contributed towards female empowerment, addressing gender-based discrimination and domestic violence?
MWDF was founded in 1998 to bring Muslim Tamil women on an equal platform to address violence against women. Right now in Mannar, we have a one-stop service centre for any woman who?s affected by any form of gender-based violence, particularly domestic violence. When the Prevention of Domestic Violence Act got enacted in 2005 we needed to educate the community about this Act and to ensure that women who have been in abusive and violent relationships get out of it. If a woman is abused and if she walks into our office her needs are taken care of completely. Counselling is given first.
If she needs medical treatment, that is provided by doctors of the Mannar hospital. We provide legal aid as well. If the woman is unable to live with the husband we have an in-house skills development training program and revolving loan fund which give them the capacity and basic capital to start an income generating initiative. So that, after separation from the husband, the abused woman and children, are not on the streets. When you file a case under the Domestic Violence Act the abuser who is most often the head of the family either does not provide or he has to go to court or jail. In that context, the woman needs a way of sustaining her family.
We work very closely with the Mannar Police. We have built a model Women Police Desk in Mannar which is women and children friendly. After this desk was established we built another one in Talaimannar upon the request of the Police.
In Post War 2009 there was a huge need for a women?s collective to come together to address women?s issues and document them from a gender perspective. At that time there had been quite a lot of atrocities including sexual violence, arbitrary detention and disappearances. This is one reason we started the WAN.
?
	MMDA gives a green light for Muslim underaged girls to be raped and perpetrators not be punished
	
	
	OMP must win the confidence of the people
	
	
	I see Buddhist extremism, Islamic fundamentalism, and Hindu nationalism growing in the country
	
	
	Female circumcision has nothing to do with Islam
	
?
We also wanted to reach out to other communities and see how we could navigate the post-war terrain to create gendered spaces and bring in structural changes that are just and affirmative.
Two of the things we have engaged with the Government in the past is the constitutional reform process where we have articulated for the repeal of Article 16 and the incorporation of economic, social and cultural rights into the Constitution.
WAN has also been engaged with the Consultation Task Force on Reconciliation mechanisms which went around the country talking to people about how the Transitional Justice (TJ) mechanisms need to be set up. Many of my colleagues were part of the zonal task forces that asked people how they want the TJ mechanisms to be set up.
We are also working hard on law reforms and expediting cases that are clogged in the Attorney General?s Department, particularly in relation to rape and sexual violence against women and girl children. We are also looking at the Constitution and how we can make women equal citizens because women are not considered equal due to personal laws and other laws which are patriarchal and conservative.
Talking about constitutional reform and the repeal of Article 16, activists have urged for the reform of the Muslim Marriage and Divorce Act (MMDA) which is long overdue. Why do you think that there is a reluctance to reform the MMDA?
Muslim women have been campaigning for reforms for over 03 decades. This is an archaic, patriarchal law which we imported from Indonesia in 1951.
MMDA is a man-made law and there are provisions and sections in this law that are against the Sharia and the Holy Quran. There have been three failed attempts to reform the MMDA, and the fourth attempt which is pending now is the 16 member committee headed by former Justice Saleem Marsoof which was appointed by Milinda Moragoda, the then Justice Minister. It is not that nobody wants to reform the MMDA. The process has started a long time back, even before we started articulating.
Conservative groups particularly the Ulamas (A body of Muslim religious scholars) of the All Ceylon Jamiyyathul Ulama (ACJU), are vehemently opposing any reforms to certain sections of the MMDA like only males can be appointed as Quazi Judges and the non-compulsory requirement of registration of Muslim marriages.
Besides, these days there is a lot of power play and politics to block the progressive section of the committee releasing its recommendations.
I strongly believe that there will be two reports since the committee is split now.
Another reason is that the Muslim community is insecure in this country because they think that reforming the MMDA will take away their unique identity, and privileges given to them in the form of a personal law.
We are very firm about the reform of the MMDA. If we don?t reform the MMDA we will be a community living in the stone age because of under-age marriages, teenage pregnancy and divorce, domestic violence, children dropping out of school, children not having birth certificates because the registration of marriages is not compulsory in MMDA, unconditional polygamy and male dominance. MMDA treats women and girls as unequal and inferior in our society.
If the MMDA is not reformed we want the opt-out option where Muslims can get married under the General Marriage and Registration Ordinance (GMRO). The GMRO will have to be amended so that two Muslims can marry under it.
But a few Muslim politicians want to keep the MMDA intact and they are stubborn. The TNA is prepared to reform the Thesavalamai, the Sinhalese politicians are prepared to reform the Kandyan Law, and currently, other Penal Code provisions are looked at by the Ministry of Women?s Affairs and Justice Ministry for any possible reform and revisions to give women equal rights and access to justice.
But Muslim women will be left out in this process. This means that constitutionally Muslim women are going to become second class citizens. We are asking the State to give our rights. This is a State responsibility.
?
Currently how grave is the situation of child marriages and teenage pregnancy in Sri Lanka?
Children under 18 cohabitating or having a sexual relationship and becoming pregnant is increasing because of technological advancements, poverty, children dropping out of school, and young boys and girls making hasty decisions.
We need to legalise abortion unconditionally. Every woman and girl has to have the freedom to choose when she wants to have a baby.
In the context of the Muslims community statutory rape does not apply to our girls when the girl is married off under-age. MMDA gives a green light for Muslim under-age girls to be raped and perpetrators not be punished. This is child sexual abuse which is criminal.
Islam does not permit this. In the areas, I work in the North and East lots of young girls under 18, have applied for Fasah Divorce because they can?t live with their husbands.
In a Fasah Divorce, the wife doesn?t get maintenance, alimony or anything since it is she who files the case for divorce. These girls are just children who are supposed to go to school, not take care of their husbands.
Quran requires maturity for marriage, but maturity does not mean just attaining age, but mental maturity to run a family. Age of marriage for Muslim girls should be 18 so that girls can complete the compulsory level of education and teach their children and if necessary find a job too.
?
Cabinet approval has been granted for a proposal to criminalise marital rape and amend the Penal Code. Do you think that this will benefit the Muslim community?
No. I feel that the Muslim ministers will lobby and request that the provisions do not apply to the Muslim women and girls, like the way they lobbied for the statutory rape provisions to exclude Muslim girls. As you know the Penal Code was amended in 1995 and as per Section 363 (e) of the Penal Code, in cases where the girl is below the age of 16, sexual intercourse with consent also constitutes rape. In the case of Muslim girls, the law on statutory rape is not applicable to a girl who is married under the age of 16 years.
?
Recently there were reports that female circumcision takes place in Sri Lanka. What has been your experience in relation to this?
It has happened in my community. I have been part of the lobby to eradicate Female Genital Mutilation (FGM). The forthcoming Child Rights Convention Review will highlight the issue of FGM. It happens in the Muslim community in secrecy.
It happens on the 40th day of the birth of the child when there is a ceremony to shave the birth head hair. The barber woman comes and shaves the head and she also has a knife or a blade with which she pricks the clitoris. For the Bohra Community, it is done before the girl turns eight. In the Muslim community, women don?t remember unless someone tells them because you are only 40 days old when it happens.
Recently I met a 28-year-old Muslim woman who is a convert and got married six months ago. This particular ritual was performed on her because her mother-in-law wanted it. This has nothing to do with Islam. It is a cultural practice in certain African countries. In 2008 the ACJU has given a letter to a father who had asked whether female circumcision should be done, and they have said that it is Wajib (Obligatory).
?
In your associations with people in the North and East do you think Sri Lanka is close to achieving reconciliation?
No. We had an ethnic conflict, but now I feel that there will be a religious conflict because extremism and nationalism are growing at every angle possible. There is a long road ahead of us for reconciliation to be achieved. None of the transitional justice mechanisms has been set up. We are eagerly waiting for the Office on Missing Persons (OMP) to function.
For reconciliation to happen the South has to reach out to the North and the East, particularly the war affected areas.
In many of the areas, I work family members of the disappeared are now sitting on the roadside for more than 300 days. They want justice. This Government promised to set up four transitional justice mechanisms and went around consulting people on how to set up those mechanisms. Besides, it also asked the people of their input for constitutional reforms. Has this Government considered such bottom-up suggestions and recommendations seriously? I do not think so. Often this Government does things because the international community is exerting pressure. This country will never heal until our politicians come forward willingly for a very transparent justice and accountability process. You need to build trust before talking about reconciliation.
On the other hand, I also see Buddhist extremism, Islamic fundamentalism, Hindu nationalism growing in the country. Most of our politicians are arousing nationalism, fundamentalism, extremism and are spreading hatred between communities for their political survival. They want to divide and rule as our colonizers did. If this is so, we can neither heal nor reconcile.
?
How hopeful are you of the OMP as a transitional justice mechanism?
OMP is the easiest mechanism out of those promised in Geneva in September 2015. OMP can find out the truth and tell the families of the disappeared and missing, what happened to their loved ones. The OMP will have a tracing unit.
It?s a huge challenge for Sri Lanka because we also don?t have the technology to trace a person who died a long time ago when we start digging the mass graves and match the DNA with family members. If the OMP is to function properly it has to build trust because the affected people have given up hope not only in the OMP but also in the other local transitional justice mechanisms.
One of the mandates given to the OMP is to collect all the information regarding disappearances in Sri Lanka under one body. We?ve had the Paranagama commission, the Udalagama Commission, and a few more old commissions that studied involuntary removal of persons including the missing during the JVP insurrection.
People talked about disappearances before the LLRC as well. The Presidential Secretariat has all these information. So the OMP should gather this information, study them and inquire into some emblematic cases, where there are strong evidence and information, as their first step. The OMP must show the affected families that they are not only just finding the truth but such truth can be used to punish the perpetrators. It must win the confidence of the people. If not I have my doubts as to whether it will work out.
?
Do you have any specific future plans?
A lot of girls and women are becoming homeless or live in unsafe places. In the post-war context, there is a lot of violence against women in their homes. Eight month old babies are raped. There is increasing incest or someone known to the girls and women are sexually abusing them. Girls are being blackmailed using social media by their partners and many have tried to commit suicide.
So I am thinking of setting up a system that will take care of these women; at least a temporary relief so that when they finally get out of such exploitation they should not worry about returning back to the same abusive home or relationship. They should have space where they could be themselves. My plan is to have a drop in centre where they can walk in at any time. It will be an emancipating place that will give them the support network, leadership skill and most importantly self-confidence.
I have walked into many Government shelters, but I don?t think they are working.

A Sri Lankan worker was sentenced to life in jail for stabbing a compatriot to death during Christmas in Dubai last year.
The 36-year-old convict was jailed for premeditated murder and consuming alcohol.
During Christmas last year, the convict was in a festive mood, drinking and singing with his wife, brothers and a group of friends from his homeland, when the man arrived at the house yelling.
The convict, who previously shared an apartment with the victim, rushed to the kitchen, grabbed a knife and followed the man outside the house.
The convict's brother had told the prosecutors that the victim used foul language, which provoked the convict. "He went to the kitchen and returned carrying a knife. He wanted to attack the man, and I tried to restrain him.
"Moments later, my wife ran to me and told me that he had stabbed the man outside the house."
The victim had already succumbed to his wounds by the time the police arrived at the scene. The convict fled the scene but surrendered to the police two days later.
Both men had previously fought because the victim reportedly broke into the convict's room and stole cash.
The convict had told the police that he hid for two days in Sharjah. He had claimed the attack was in self-defence, denying premeditated murder but admitting to consuming alcohol.
The ruling is subject to appeal within 15 days. (Khaleej Times)

Lenient marking for O/L Math paper: Exams Commissioner
	
The GCE O/L Examination Mathematics paper was not extraordinarily difficult as claimed but steps had been taken to make amendments to the marking scheme to provide justice to the students as there were certain sections of questions deemed difficult, Commissioner General of Examinations Sanath Pujitha said today.
Mr. Pujitha said in a statement that the Department of Examinations had reached this decision following a study conducted on the issue.
?Many parties have claimed that majority of the students had faced difficulties in answering the Mathematics paper as there were some advanced questions. A panel consisting 20 members including paper compiling board, chief markers and Mathematics teachers have conducted the said study,? he added.
He said that at the end of any examination they would conduct such a survey collecting sample of answer scripts.
He said that following the study it was evident that the examination was not extremely difficult to achieve a simple pass as claimed.
?However, some questions were to achieve high-level skills and were to be answered with reasoning and problem solving, and it was difficult for students to achieve full marks,? he added. (Kalathma Jayawardhane and Chaturanga Pradeep)

More priority to Jerusalem than UNHRC: Sarath
	
While stating that the government had given additional priority in voting against Donald Trump?s declaration to recognize Jerusalem as Israel?s capital at the UN, former MP and retired Rear Admiral Sarath Weerasekera said it had turned a blind eye on the UNHRC resolution in which the Sri Lankan soldiers have been accused.
Speaking to the Daily Mirror, he asked as to why the government?s move had been dull on the UNHRC resolution 30/1 which had accused Lankan soldiers over serious violations and abuses of human rights and related crimes that they have allegedly committed during the period 2002 February to 2011 November.
?It is visible that Sri Lanka is being humiliated and tarnished on account of unsubstantiated war crimes accusations by the UNHRC resolution 30/1. But it seems that the government and the rest of the political parties are not concerned with the issue whereas the government has categorically announced its stance on the Trump?s declaration to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. That?s pathetic,? Weerasekera stressed.
He said a delegation could have been sent to the UN to respond in a similar way in the wake of Lord Naseby?s defence of Sri Lanka and added the issue was why a similar stand cannot be adopted on behalf of our own country. (Sheain Fernandopulle)

??not so mad to refuse an offer like that!?
	
?
A political secret that a learned purohita from Kandy revealed in public the other day created a sensation in political circles.
?
Addressing a public meeting in his home turf, the learned purohita of CCS fame told the gathering:?
?I am going to tell you something that has remained a top secret so far. Our Loku Mahattaya had decided at the outset to offer the chair of our party to our former boss. But the former boss declined to accept the post and this has now led to a crisis in the party.?
Startled by this revelation, the JO stalwarts rushed to the former leader?s official residence. They asked him whether there was any truth in the ?secret? revealed by the learned purohita.
The former boss had greeted this query with a loud guffaw. After recovering himself, he said: ?He is not so mad as to offer me something that he got with so much of effort. I too am not so mad either to refuse an offer like that!??

Polythene: Manufacturers warn of shortage in Jan
	
Polythene manufacturers today warned of a possible biodegradable polythene shortage due to the polythene ban which is to be enforced from January 1.
Speaking to the Daily Mirror, Polythene Manufacturers and Recyclers Association (PMRA) President Anura Wijethunga said the Central Environment Authority?s had banned polythene as per the directions of President Maithripala Sirisena. While the importation of high-density polyethylene (HDPE) materials was banned last June, the usage of such products would be completely prohibited from January 2018.
As such he said the entire industry was badly affected by the unforeseen cost of conversion to low-density polyethylene (LDPE).
According to Mr. Wijethunga, the cost producing low-density polyethylene was at least 80 percent higher than the production of high-density polyethylene. He also said the quantity of producing low-density polyethylene would also halve when compared to the production of high-density polyethylene.
Although the government had promised to provide tax concessions to replace machinery needed for the conversion, it was yet to be done, Wijethunga said.
Daily Mirror learned that tax concessions had been granted to import some chemicals used in manufacturing, however the move made no change in the expenses incurred by manufacturers as they only used raw materials which were excluded from the tax relief for production.
?Considering the undue cost of manufacturing low-density polyethylene (LDPE) materials the manufacturers will have to increase the prices of their products between 50 to 80 percent of the present price,? he added. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

Possibility that SLFP would join SLPP
	
The possibility is that the SLFP would join with the SLPP to establish the administration of any local government body in the event the SLFP coming first but short of an absolute majority on the result of the LG polls, a senior Cabinet Minister said today.
Science, Technology and Research Minister Susil Premajayantha said joining with the SLPP or ?pohottuwa? party or any other political party affiliated to the SLPP coalition or the UPFA was much easier and comfortable than joining with any other rival party to come to power in a local government body as they are family members of the SLFP though at some times had differences of ideas and policies.
Addressing the weekly SLFP news briefing at the party office yesterday (27) Minister Premajayantha said all candidates contesting the LG polls from the SLFP under the hand symbol or from the UPFA under the betel leaf symbol must give a pledge not to resort to any kind of corruption, thuggery or misrule as a candidate after the poll.
?We, the SLFP will not have any problem to obtain a working majority in any local government body if we join either with the Communist Party (CPSL) Ceylon Workers Congress (CWC) or National Congress. So it is highly possible that we form administration in a majority of LG bodies on the result of the February 10 election,? Minister Premajayantha stressed.
?Leaders and agents of 22 political parties affiliated to the UPFA and contest LG polls under the betel leaf symbol have been summoned to the BMICH on Thursday (today) and all of them are expected to give a pledge that their election campaign will be free of violence and fully adhered to the election law. They also vow that they will not abuse their office and will not use State property for their advantage once elected,? Minister Premajayantha said.
Tomorrow (29) all candidates of the UPFA and SLFP numbering nearly 9,000 who contest for all 341 LG bodies will gather at the Sugathadasa indoor stadium to give the same pledge and ensure a clean and corruption free administration in grass root level as members, deputy mayors or mayors. Both meetings will be chaired by party leader, President Maithripala Sirisena.
Minister Premajayantha, who is also a senior deputy President of the SLFP said it will be a great mistake if someone thinks that a political party could win the LG polls by dividing the SLFP and added when all anti capitalist forces are united, it will be a great force.
He said under President Sirisena, the SLFP has brought minority communities under the hand symbol and the SLFP was contesting for 20 local government bodies in Jaffna alone fielding 453 Tamil candidates.(Sandun A Jayasekera)

Russian team to visit SL to check plant quarantine
	
A team of technical experts from Russia would visit Sri Lanka in late January-early February 2018 for familiarization with the current plant quarantine procedure in Sri Lanka, the Sri Lankan Embassy in Russia said.
In a statement following Russia?s decision to lift restrictions imposed on Sri Lankan tea imports, the Embassy said the decision has been made after understanding the concerns made by the Sri Lankan side.
It said the nine member Sri Lankan technical delegation had a fruitful discussion with the Head of the Russian Federal Service for Veterinary and Phytosanitary Surveillance (Rosselkhoznadzor), Deputy Head of Rosselkhoznadzor in charge of phytosanitary matters, and other officials of Rosselkhoznadzor on December 25.
?This meeting was also represented by the Russian Ministry of Agriculture; representatives of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Ministry of Economic Development and RusTeaCoffee Association of Russia. During the discussion, the Russian side indicated that they were satisfied with the measures proposed by the Sri Lankan side to ensure the shipping of pest-free plant products consignments to Russia,? it said.
Sri Lanka has indicated that there are no records found since 1978 of this identified pest and this is a probable contamination due to the use of disinfested container.
?However, Sri Lanka assured that it would take stringent measures to further strengthen the current phytosanitary procedures to avoid any repetition. The letter addressed to President Vladimir Putin by President Maithripala Sirisena in this regard made a great impact on the positive resolution of the situation,? the embassy said.

Shipping containers to be cleaned and disinfected
	
Russia agreed to lift the restriction on tea trade with Sri Lanka on condition that all shipping containers were thoroughly cleaned and disinfected under the supervision of the National Plant Quarantine Service, prior to loading to ensure they did not contain plant matter or pest species, Sri Lanka's Ambassador in Russia Saman Weerasinghe said.
He said that during negotiations on Monday, the Sri Lankan side had said that certain conditions as confirmed with the Russian authorities would be fulfilled to facilitate future trade.
He said the Phytosanitary Certificate issued by the National Plant Quarantine Service for every shipment should specifically certify the inspection for and the absence of Khapra beetle, including its larval forms.
?The Sri Lanka Tea Board and the National Plant Quarantine Service will conduct regular inspections of warehouses and other sites in the supply chain to ensure that no pest species of concern to the Russian Federation become associated with any produce to be exported to Russia,? the ambassador said.
He said President Maithripala Sirisena?s letter to Russian President Vladimir Putin also had a positive effect in getting the restriction lifted. (Kelum Bandara)

Solve SAITM issue without delay: MR
	
The SAITM issue,?which has already come to the attention of the medical authorities in countries like the UK?and Australia, should be resolved in a just and reasonable manner without further delay, former president MP Mahinda Rajapaksa said today.
In a statement, he said the government finally announced that the SAITM medical degree will be abolished.
?However, the parties concern?complain that this pledge is not being implemented. The government should ensure that there is no further disruption of medical education with university students taking to the streets and medical officers forced into taking trade union action on account of this disputed medical degree course,? he said.
He said the medical education in the?country has been at a complete standstill since 2016.
?In a situation where the students who qualified to enter the medical faculties in 2016 have not yet commenced their courses, the students who passed the A/L examination in 2017 will also be awaiting entry into the medical faculties. Since clinical practice is mandatory in addition to lectures, medical faculties have difficulties in taking in a new batch without the previous one going on to the next stage,? Mr. Rajapaksa said.
He further said the continuation of this dispute over standards and accreditation in medical education could also place the international status of all Sri Lankan medical degrees at risk.
