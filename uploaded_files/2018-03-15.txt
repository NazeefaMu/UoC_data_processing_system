Australia says SL best partner in tackling people smuggling
	
While claiming that Sri Lanka is perhaps Australia?s strongest partner in tackling maritime people smuggling, Australia today said it will gift three Port Class vessels to the Sri Lankan Coast Guard?later this year.
Australian High Commissioner Bryce Hutchesson?said every people smuggling boat that has departed Sri Lanka attempting to reach Australia has failed?in the last four years.
He expressed these views at a ceremony held in Galle yesterday in which Australia gifted two Bay Class Vessel engines to the Sri Lankan Navy.
In a statement, the High Commission said both engines have been installed in SLNS Mihikatha, one of two Bay Class Vessels gifted by the Australian Government in 2014 to bolster the Sri Lankan Navy?s maritime security capability.
High Commissioner Hutchesson said the engines and vessels are a tangible example of Australia?s commitment to working cooperatively with Sri Lanka on a range of maritime threats.
The High Commissioner and Rear Admiral Piyal de Silva presided over the ceremony.
Both commended the close and longstanding relationship between Australia and Sri Lanka on people smuggling, transnational crime and sea and maritime search and rescue.
Australia provides ongoing technical support for these vessels and to the Sri Lankan Navy through training, gifting of equipment and information sharing, the statement said.

Britain confronts Russia over poisoning of ex-spy
	
THE HINDU, 14th MARCH, 2018- While the poisoning of former double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia in the English city of Salisbury on March 4 may appear to have similarities to the circumstances around the death of former FSB agent Alexander Litvinenko in London 2006, the government?s rhetoric has been strikingly tougher and more definitive this time.
On Monday night, just over a week after Mr. Skripal and his daughter were found unconscious on a shopping mall bench, British Prime Minister Theresa May told the House of Commons that it was ?highly likely? that Russia was responsible for poisoning from a ?military grade nerve agent of a type developed by Russia? under its Novichok nerve gas programme.

Britain to expel 23 Russian diplomats, cancel visits over nerve agent
	
?
Britain will expel 23 Russian diplomats accused of engaging in intelligence activities and cancel an invitation for a visit by Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, Prime Minister Theresa May said on Wednesday.
The measures are part of a ?full and robust? response to the use of a Russia-developed nerve agent to poison a former double agent and his daughter in Britain, and Moscow?s refusal to account for the presence of the toxin, May told parliament.
Britain will also send no senior officials or members of the royal family to this year?s football World Cup in Russia, suspending ?all planned high-level contacts? between London and Moscow, she said.
The Russian embassy in London condemned the expulsion of the diplomats as a ?hostile action? that is ?totally unacceptable, unjustified and short-sighted.?
?All the responsibility for the deterioration of the Russia-UK relationship lies with the current political leadership of Britain,? the embassy said in a statement on its website.
Britain has summoned Russian Ambassador Alexander Yakovenko to inform him that the 23 Russian diplomats were being declared personae non gratae, the statement said.

Dayasiri invites Kohli for holiday in SL
	
Sports minister Dayasiri Jaysekera has invited Indian captain Virat Kohli for a holiday in Sri Lanka, Indian media reported.
"I am not inviting Kohli to play here, but I want him to spend a few days with his wife Anushka Sharma. After marriage, he has not visited this country. The couple can be this nation's guest. There are several good places to see here," the minister told mid-day recently.
The sports minister is a fan of Kohli and had specially come to see his batting during India's second Test here in August last year.
India skipper Virat Kohli, one of the fittest cricketers in the world, the cricketing star acknowledged in a recent interview that the time has come that he listens to his body and manage workload, going forward in his career. Virat Kohli has been rested for the ongoing tri-nation Twenty20 series in Sri Lanka.
'Physically I had a few niggles, I am just getting over those. The workload has started to disagree (taking a toll) with me a little bit. I have to be very careful about how I go forward with my body, my mind, my cricket," Kohli said on the sidelines of a promotional event for noted watch brand Tissot. Kohli said the break is helping him recover for fresh challenges ahead, starting with the IPL.

The state of emergency would remain for as long as President Maithripala Sirisena decides to revoke it upon his return to the country on March 17, Presidential Secretary Austin Fernando said yesterday.
Mr Fernando said the President, in his proclamation of the enforcement of emergency regulations, did not refer to a deadline.
?When questioned at the time the President and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe met with the heads of diplomatic missions, the President said it would be for one week, and it should have lapsed by the midnight of March 13. Yet, in terms of the law, the President himself should revoke the Gazette notification, which he has to do, only while in Sri Lanka. So, we have to wait for his return. Until such time, the state of emergency will remain,? he said.

Govt. will soon correct itself and deliver goods: PM
	
The government will soon correct itself speedily and deliver what the people need just after the Sinhala and Hindu New Year, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said today
The Prime Minister expressed these sentiments at the opening of the new belfry and the golden fence around the sacred Bodhiya at Sri Anandaramaya in Kegalle.
"We said we would do many things. We were not able to implement some of the things as promised and could not complete other programmes we started. However people wanted things done fast. This is why they rejected us at the last local government election. People actually gave us a signal. Therefore we have to correct ourselves without delay," the Prime Minister said.
He said the government had already fixed a plan of action to deliver what the people want. The first one he said is to make essential goods and services available at affordable prices. Also he said employment opportunities had to be created as soon as possible while more investments should be brought in. He added that it was essential to expedite the development of infrastructure facilities. " We will implement all these plans rigorously after the Sinhala and Hindu New Year," he added.
Referring to the recent clashes in Kandy, Mr. Wickremesinghe said the riots had resulted in people of other religions losing their trust on the majority Buddhists. "It is not possible to safeguard Buddhism if others lose their faith on Buddhists, " he also said.
State Minister of Defense Ruwan Wijewardene said it is essential to develop temples in villages. "Buddhism could be safeguarded only if temples in the villages are developed," he said.
The Anu Nayaka Thera of the Ramanya Chapter most Venerable Waragoda Premaratana Thera said Sinhala Buddhist will have to overcome some challenges which they should overcome in the future. He said people should focus more on spiritual development mire than financial development. "People focus more on their financial development rather than spiritual development. Some parents encourage their children to go for tuition rather than encouraging them to go for their Sunday school lessons," he said.
President of Amarapura Maha Sanga Sabha Venerable Gamthune Assaji Thera said some VIPs does not know how to engage in religious observances in the proper manner. " Some VIPs does not know how to resite gathas. I have to say these things today as these VIPs who run the country does not seek the advise of maha sanga though they are bound by the tradition to do it" the Thera said.(Yohan Perera)

Love in pieces
	
Acting, the script, camerawork, the cameo appearances by professionals from other fields, all add up that there?s hardly anything BAD about Premaya Nam
In Premaya Nam, Vishwa, played by Shyam Fernando, is disgusted by his urine and cringes at the act of passing it so much that he has to have a shower every time he goes to the lavatory. This impedes on his marriage and works so much that after he leaves his job and after his wife leaves him, he admits himself to the National Institute of Mental Health at Angoda.
The English version of the title, Dirty, Yellow, Darkness,?is a sleek summing up of the fears that beset Vishwa, who is the first solidly drawn up mental patient to be depicted in a local film
	Premaya Nam does not work out such a miracle, because our hero, at the instigation of his wife, has to transcend those frailties
After a few encounters with the hospital staff and the other patients, he thinks he?s cured, casually dismisses the doctor?s concerns, procrastinates on his medication and treatments, and leaves the hospital before his term is over. But he is not cured: OCD (Obsessive Compulsive Disorder) usually is not, which is where he realises that his illness can be cured only by his free will.
The wife returns to him on condition that he tide himself over his mania, and in the end, with the two of them at a restaurant, we realise that he has tided over.
The English version of the title, Dirty, Yellow, Darkness, is a sleek summing up of the fears that beset Vishwa, who I personally think is the first solidly drawn up mental patient to be depicted in a local film.
The Sinhala original, on the other hand, emphasises on the romantic angle to the plot and the conflicts between Vishwa?s parents and his in-laws. When the latter realise, eventually, that Vishwa is not really mad and his illness is curable, the catharsis they reach is ours as well, since we are a part of the same audiences who treat mental illness as crudely and one-dimensionally as them.
The fact that the director of Premaya Nam himself suffered from OCD, and the fact that he researched well on the stereotypes sustained by the popular culture here with respect to those like him, thus helped in making his debut probably one of the most refreshingly novel contemporary movies I?ve seen in Sri Lanka. And that?s saying a lot.
In an interview with Global Press Journal, Vindana (who co-directed the movie with his brother, Kalpana) contends that when compared with the horrendous resource-deficits characteristic of the public sector in general, the budget expended on meals, medicines, and everything else on more than 1,000 patients by the?NIMH is astounding.
Part of the charm of Premaya Nam is how it raises our eyebrows in this respect, how it presents us with stereotypical freaks and then demolishes the stereotypes we?ve built up and pasted over them. The dramatisation of mental health has been one of the most sorely lamentable points about our popular culture, because the most frequently resorted to clich?s and qualities by our filmmakers and television directors ? the overdrawn drawl, the deliberately wrong accent, the apish look ? have accentuated our fears of the typical mental patient, who at the hands of these directors display characteristics more in line with Down syndrome patients than with actual mental patients.
The typical ?human interest? Sinhala movie almost always tends to portray, as the hero, the gangster, the outsider, the man or woman whose only strength is his or her sanity.
By questioning whether we need even that sanity, Vandana and Kalpana have provided us with a different hero, and barring the defects of the film, which aren?t apparent on a single viewing (you need to see Premaya Nam twice to infer what those defects are), that?s the biggest strength this film has.
It is edited and shot so rapidly, without losing track of the need to explicate, to elaborate, that it?s very nearly a perfect piece of work.
The acting, the script, the camerawork, even the cameo appearances by professionals from other fields, all add up so much that there?s hardly anything BAD that can be said of Premaya Nam.
In that sense, the first half of the film is what parses along really well.
If Vishwa?s visit to Angoda seems too quickly cut and too quickly done away with, it can mean either of two things: the director wants to carelessly rush over and considers the scenes at the hospital to be peripheral, or the director wants to concentrate on Vishwa so acutely that he wants us to go beyond our hero?s visit to Angoda with regard to his coalescence.
Vishwa is never truly rehabilitated during his tenure at Angoda, but that is only half the story; the main purpose for which he?s placed at the NIMH is for him, and us, gain an understanding of what it means to be a mental patient in the first place.
Neither the comical interludes between a hard done by a patient (Who looks aggressive, but has his reasons) and Vishwa nor the romantic interludes between Vishwa and the head nurse (played by Suranga Ranaweera) go anywhere.
Premaya Nam is realistic than idealistic, more a poignant anecdote than a mushy everyone?s-happy Hollywood homily
The truth is that they don?t have to because, by the time they end (for the time being), we know what they?re there for: to understand that those who suffer from schizophrenia, are bipolar, and have OCD aren?t unredeemable freaks by any stretch of the imagination.
As Himal Kotelawala aptly puts it in his review, though, Premaya Nam can?t be considered as Sri Lanka?s answer to Rain Man or A Beautiful Mind, because (for me, at least) in those two movies, tempered as they are by the eternal desire of the typical director to pander to popular audiences, the hero (the autistic savant in Rain Man, the schizophrenic economist in A Beautiful Mind) is redeemed by the outside world?s acceptance of his frailties.
Premaya Nam does not work out such a miracle, because our hero, at the instigation of his wife (played by Samanalee Fonseka), has to transcend those frailties by his own bootstraps.
When Samanalee tells him that she won?t return to him if he reverted to his earlier habits, for instance, we are with her, because while we understand Vishwa (as she does), we also know (again, as she does) that our society has not evolved so dramatically as to expect that it will accept him for who he is if he continues to behave the way he does.
In that respect, Premaya Nam is more realistic than idealistic, more a poignant anecdote, than a mushy everyone?s-happy Hollywood homily about those who are (considered to be) different from us.
And so, in that last scene, when Vishwa decides to stay with his wife instead of moving to another table after dropping his cutlery (which earlier to him would have meant eating with dirty forks), Vindana and Kalpana have it both ways: a resolution for our hero, and a resolution for us.
I fervently think that?s the real strength in Premaya Nam, apart from its honest, sincere, startling depiction of OCD.
Without conceding that Premaya Nam represents, and affirms, life as it actually is (it?s still a dramatisation, and at certain points it tends to engage in wishful thinking) ? always a pitfall when it comes to reviewing movies like this, for the critic at least ? I do realise and appreciate the fact that Vindana and Kalpana has done something different, with a refreshingly different cast and crew (the cameraman, Jaan Shenberger, has worked on a short film and a TV series before; Premaya Nam is his debut in film).
It is like watching a reworked Satyajit Ray or Jean Renoir movie because we identify with every character, even those who lack empathy, and when we do, there?s nothing more that we really want.
The innocence that envelopes the story is the same innocence that, in the end, envelopes us. You don?t feel cheated; the claps and the tears these two brothers have evinced from us are truly deserved, because they sum up just how intimate we grow, as the story progresses, with the material, the backdrop, of that story.

Merkel sworn in for fourth term
	
?
DPA, 14th MARCH, 2018-Angela Merkel has been sworn in as German chancellor before the lower house of parliament, the Bundestag, in Berlin.
Ending with the phrase ?So help me God,? Merkel took her oath of office in front of parliamentary speaker and former finance minister Wolfgang Schaeuble on Wednesday.
Merkel had earlier been elected to her fourth term as chancellor by the Bundestag. Merkel garnered 364 of the 688 votes delivered in the secret ballot on Wednesday and was therefore elected as expected in the first round of voting. At least 355 votes were required in the 709-seat chamber. There were 315 votes against her re-election and nine abstentions.
For the first time, Merkel?s husband Joachim Sauer was present for the vote, as was her mother, Herlind Kasner.
German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier had earlier proposed Merkel - who heads the largest party in the chamber, the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) - as chancellor to the lawmakers in accordance with the constitution.

Mixing sugar into tea: Explanations called from 53 factories
	
Chairman of the Sri Lanka Tea Board Rohan Pethiyagoda said yesterday that explanations have been called from 53 tea factory owners who were suspected of mixing sugar and glucose with tea during the threshing process.
They have been given a weeks deadline to send in their reasons for this misdemeanour, which ends on Tuesday (20), he said.
Pethiyagoda further said that they had raided 80 tea factories in Ratnapura, Galle, Matara and 53 factories of them which were found to be engaging in this illegal practice. If they are found guilty of mixing sugar or glucose with tea action will be taken to cancel their license, he explained.
He said that there is a thought process among tea factory owners that by adding sugar with tea during the threshing process the tea turns black thereby allowing them to sell the tea at a higher price to the market.
Pethiyagoda said that while the thought process behind this is right the tea that is produced as a result gathers mould and what is even more disturbing it also produces a cancerous carcinogen which produces aflatoxin. he warned that such illegal practises could do great damage to the image of ?Ceylon Tea? which has built a name for itself in the world market.
Pethiyagoda said that they had found 14 tea factories had been found guilty of engaging in this illegal practise last year and their licenses had been suspended for three months. (Ranjan Kasthuri)

Palestinian PM survives roadside bomb attack
	
?
REUTERS, 14th MRACH, 2018- Palestinian Prime Minister Rami Hamdallah survived an assassination attempt in Gaza on Tuesday, the Palestinian Authority said after an apparent roadside bomb targeted his motorcade.??
The attack on the Western-backed leader, who is spearheading the Authority?s reconciliation efforts with Gaza?s dominant group, Hamas, took place as the White House prepared to hold a meeting on the humanitarian situation in the enclave.??
There was no immediate claim of responsibility for what one Palestinian Authority security official in Gaza said was a roadside bomb. A second device failed to explode, the official said.??
Six security guards were wounded, Hamdallah said shortly after the attack.??
Hamas, which condemned the attack, and the Authority said they viewed the incident as an attempt to prevent implementation of a unity agreement signed in October that has raised hopes of improving economic conditions in the territory of 2 million people.??
Minutes after the explosion, the 59-year-old prime minister, apparently unhurt, delivered a speech at the inauguration of an internationally-funded wastewater treatment plant and pledged to continue to pursue Palestinian unity.?

Petitions against Judicature Act: JHU to mediate
	
While claiming that some joint opposition members who were fear-stricken due to their past wrong doings had gone before the Supreme Court against the Judicature Act, the Jathika Hela Urumaya said today it would appear in court today to ensure that the Act would be passed in Parliament without any hindrance.
JHU General Secretary and Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka told a news conference that Judicature (Amendment) Act was brought in by the government to set up a permanent High Court-at-bar to expedite the large amount of pending cases.
He said what the government should have done at first was to set up this special court as promised by the government at the last presidential election to take action against wrong doers.
Mr. Ranawaka said the people gave a mandate to the government to take action against frauds and corruption of the previous government at the presidential election.
He said he and several other ministers presented four Cabinet papers to set up the special court on several occasions but failed to do so due to intervention by some government members against it.
He said the judiciary was gradually becoming independent and added that it was not enough to have an independent judicial system but it should be efficient, impartial and modernized as well.
?The judicial system should be impartial. We feel that the judiciary is partial to certain people where they are concerned as special people and prevent their cases being taken,? he said.
Mr. Ranawaka said information regarding the cases against some people is being revealed now and added that they were trying to prevent the special court was set up.
?This case will not take up cases of the previous government but the case on the Central Bank bond issuance can also be taken up at this court,? he said. (Ajith Siriwardana)

PM: Laws to curb social media hate speech soon
	
Sri Lanka would have new laws enacted to control social media and hate speech, in a few weeks? time, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said yesterday.
The Prime Minister said this during the opening of the new swimming pool at the Isipathana College, Colombo, last morning.
He said the Attorney General Department was currently studying such laws enacted by other countries.
?A number of countries in the world have introduced laws to control social media and hate speech. The UK has laws in place to control hate speech. So has Kenya. There are laws to control social media in Germany,? he said.
?A draft pertaining to such laws has already been presented to the Senate in the Philippines. I have also advised the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to look at how the other countries in our region are working on controlling social media so that we too could follow through, together with those countries,? the Prime Minister said.
At the same time, the Prime Minister assured that there was no move to ban or block social media anymore.
?I am the one who introduced internet to Sri Lanka in 1993 by signing an agreement with the then US Vice President Al Gore and I am fully aware of the importance of the internet and social media.
?Some of the richest companies such as Uber had made money by operating via social media while even companies such as Google had also been successfully operating online.
?Therefore we are fully aware of the value of it. Our objective, therefore, is to encourage positive use of social media and minimize the wrong usage,? he added.
Mr Wickremesinghe said social media was blocked following the advice of defence authorities who informed the cabinet that hate speech and false information aired through social media had made things difficult.
?The Defence authorities advised the cabinet to take some steps to control social media as it made the situation in Kandy worse. There would have been a worse scenario if the Government did not take steps to block social media during the riots.
?Some are questioning us on this move today but they have forgotten that there were disturbances in Kandy last week,? he said.
Minister of Higher Education Akila Viraj Kariyawasam said the Government would introduce a new school curriculum soon.
The new curriculum he said is prepared in accordance with the needs of the changing job market.
?Students will not have to drop out of school if they fail the GCE Ordinary Level examination from next year,? the Minister said. (Yohan Perera)

Prez instructs TRC to lift ban on Facebook
	
The temporarily restriction to access the social media site Facebook was lifted this afternoon, following the instruction of President Maithripala Sirisena, the Presidential Media Division said in a statement today.
"The President has given instructions to the Telecommunications Regulatory Commission (TRC) of Sri Lanka to remove the temporary restriction to access the social media site Facebook with immediate effect," the statement said.
President Sirisena has given this instruction following a detailed assessment of the decisions taken during the meeting between the Secretary to the President and the representatives from Facebook, held at the Presidential Secretariat, yesterday.
The media release by the Presidential Secretariat said the Government took steps to restrict access to some social media platforms temporarily during the last few days, in order to curtail the attempts to spread communal violence across the country, misusing the social media in a manner detrimental to the national harmony. This initiative paved the way to contain the situation and the Government is taking steps to allow access to social media while implementing the necessary monitoring and surveillance methods to ensure the public safety.
The Secretary to the President, Austin Fernando met representatives from Facebook yesterday to discuss the situation in Sri Lanka. Facebook conveyed to the Secretary that it does not tolerate hate speech on its platform. Facebook shared its deep commitment to remove hate speech connected to race, ethnicity, national origin, and religious affiliation in the context of the immediate emergency situation in Sri Lanka.
The government will continue to work together with Facebook to prevent hate speech and misuse of the platform. Anyone propagating hate speech on Facebook is liable under Sri Lankan law and prompt action will be taken as per Facebook?s community standards. Both sides will continue to engage extensively to discuss these matters.
The Government extends its regrets over the inconvenience caused to the public due to this temporary restriction to access social media tools.

Private Co. grabs Muturajawela land for housing scheme
	
Environmentalists are perturbed about a private company alienating 406 acres from the Muthurajawela sanctuary to construct a housing scheme.
Environmentalist Sajeewa Chamikara of the Movement for Land and Agricultural Reforms said the Agrarian Services Department had permitted the private company to construct a housing complex on the recommendation of a senior official of the Department in the Gampaha District.
He pointed out that Rs.32,551 million had been paid by the company to the Agrarian Services Department for 65,102 perches at the rate of Rs.500 a perch.
Mr. Chamikara said the clearing of this wetland, rich in bio-diversity would result in an extensive environmental damage.
?Muthurajawela is the largest coastal marshy land in the country spreading over a vast area from Kelani River to the Negombo Lagoon. It is rich in endemic birds and animals and mangroves unique to the area. Muthurajawela had been a smiling tract of paddy fields but due to the flow of seawater through the Hamilton Canal constructed by the British it turned unfit for agriculture,? Chamikara said.
He said that the government in 1965 planned to construct houses in Muturajawela for the shanty dwellers in Colombo. However, it was abandoned on the advice of the environmentalists who explained the importance of Muthurajawela as an environmental zone rich in biodiversity.
?However the Agrarian Services Department has taken the step to alienate a vast area of 406 acres for a housing scheme regardless of its environmental damage,? he said.
He further said the amending environmental and forest conservation regulations for the benefit of the investors under the free economy should immediately come to an end or else the country would soon be a parched-up desert.

Revitalizing UNP
	
The February 10 Local Government election was one of many revelations: the dismal performance of the United National Party (UNP) being one of them.Following the people?s verdict, it came as no surprise when the crisis-ridden party announced that it would be initiating a reform process navigated by the younger UNP members. A committee headed by State Minister Ruwan Wijewardene was armed with the task of broadening the scope of reforms, appointed following a meeting held with Premier Ranil Wickremesinghe last month. The Daily Mirror approached several young members of the UNP to obtain their views on the recent developments within the party and areas of concern which should be addressed immediately.
?
Youth Branches Must Be Incorporated
Speaking to the Daily Mirror Chairman of the Committee State Minister Ruwan Wijewardene said the committee report was still underway and it was expected to be finalised this week.
?Certain suggestions have been made by the female members of the party, while the Deputy Leader has also made several suggestions. Once all these views are taken in, the report will be compiled and we expect it to be finalised this week,? he said.
Asked about the challenges the party has been faced with, the Minister said a holistic view of the party must be considered before changes are drafted.
?We as a party have to look at the organisation as a whole. The UNP has experienced a decline since the 70s and in order to remedy this situation, we have to look at the organisational branches. As a party, it is imperative that we address certain areas of concern. Some of these require immediate attention while others involve structural long-term planning,? the Minister said.
?A number of opinions have to be taken into consideration. There are senior members of the party who have expressed their views. There are provincial councillors and local councillors who have opined on various matters. An integration of all these views will be required in addressing these long-term and short-term changes,? he added. Minister Wijewardene made these comments with reference to a recent statement made by the Premier on long and short-term changes to be implemented within the party.
The younger UNP members should be granted more authority. There are various lapses in the organisation itself and these young members should be given the opportunity to work to overcome the issues. The youth branches must be incorporated in the journey forward
Commenting on the members who have challenged the present leadership of the party Minister Wijewardene said there were more important issues to be dealt with at present.
?There are some people who have held this view that the party leadership needs to change, some are of the view that such a change is not necessary. There are diverse views within the UNP right now and the members are divided on the matter of taking the party forward. However, I believe there are more pressing issues in the country at hand, which require our attention. But I must note that the UNP is a democratic party and appropriate action will be taken in due course.?
?Once the report is tabled, the working committee will deliberate further on the next course of action,? Wijewardene noted.
However the State Minister admitted that there were divisions in the party that would be addressed in due course.
?There are some areas that should be addressed immediately; I believe the younger UNP members should be granted more authority. There are various lapses in the organisation itself and these young members should be given the opportunity to work to overcome the issues. The youth branches must be incorporated in the journey forward. Once the report is tabled we will be able to deliberate on the specific ways of incorporating the young members,? he said.
Suggestions made by female members and Deputy Leader to be deliberated
	Some changes require time
	There are diverse views within the UNP right now
?
Working Together to Change Party Culture
Commenting on attempts to restructure the UNP, Minister Navin Dissanayake said a continuous dialogue within the party had resulted in the stakeholders understanding what areas of concern have to be addressed.
?We?ve had a dialogue within the party on what kinds of changes are necessary. What is clear is that whatever changes which will take place should not be artificial. It should be real and effective change so that UNP members and the country at large can feel that change.
I think Mr. Wickremesinghe is looking at a new leadership model where there is an overall change in the party leadership structure.
We have all given our recommendations to him in writing,? the Minister said adding that the reforms committee will convene to deliberate matters further.
We?ve had a dialogue within the party on what kinds of changes are necessary. What is clear is that whatever changes which will take place should not be artificial
?There are 10 to 12 of us in the second tier leadership. We intend to go ahead with this dialogue and hope to come to a conclusion soon,? Minister Dissanayake said responding to a query about when the changes would take effect.
?These kinds of changes cannot be done overnight because it has to be discussed at length. In a democratic party like ours, it takes time for a team to decide on what changes people should agree upon. Everybody has to be comfortable and there should be a broad consensus on what the changes are going to be,? he said.
The Minister did not fail to note that the planned transformation must cater to the collective advancement of the party.
?My personal view is that more than the individual slots, there has to be a collective change for the better, for the party. All party members are working as a team to bring about a change in the culture of the party. I believe the Prime Minister is fully aware of what has to be done. He has indicated that he too wants to have an effective second level leadership change. So, let us wait and see what kind of changes will come about,? Minister Dissanayake said.
Changes should not be artificial. Country should feel the change
	Democratic parties take time to decide on what changes are needed
?
Waiting for the right time
Asked of what the reforms committee report entails Minister Fernando said that clear reforms had been drafted, however, no names had been mentioned in the report.
?What we expect is a rejuvenation for the party after the drawbacks suffered recently. Our objective must be to bring back the confidence not only within the party cadre but also among the people.?
Commenting on immediate and long-term reforms specified by the Premier, he said that some of the changes would be administered within 30 days.
?What the Prime Minister said was noted during a group meeting we had. Certain changes are to be implemented during a 30-day period. The Premier will start talking to us over the course of this week and discuss the way forward. We had a plan of rebuilding the party, with details on which areas need to be addressed. We need image building in the face of the country. Even if the reforms are perceived to take a longer time, we will push for them to be implemented before long. It is up to the younger members to prompt necessary changes and convince our leader to address them,? he said.
Commenting on the setbacks experienced by the party Minister Fernando detailed a number of reasons for the UNP?s unsatisfactory performance.
?One reason for the party?s dismal performance recently was that we haven?t met the expectations of the people. We had not provided them with tangible change. The promises were not delivered. If we can fulfil the promises by at least 50% I believe there will be an improvement of the situation. We had identified several mishaps on our part, such as the provision of vouchers and we are now looking at ways to rectify them,? the Minister admitted.
?We also need to look at the marketing aspect. Special attention needs to be paid to the manner in which the media handled us. We want the media to portray the truth. If we segregate the evening news on television and radio only 10 minutes would be dedicated to the government and the remainder of the broadcast time is allocated for the Opposition. It is clear that media is operating on their own mandates. We need to find ways in which we can communicate with the media better,? he added.
Our efforts were apparent, especially during the Local Government election. We are still not sure if this backfired on us but our stance has not changed. We will make way for a stronger female cadre in the party, the Colombo mayor being the best example?
Speaking on the matter of women?s representation in reforms, Minister Fernando said the UNP will continue to fight for equal opportunities for women.
?Our efforts were apparent, especially during the Local Government election. We are still not sure if this backfired on us but our stance has not changed. We will make way for a stronger female cadre in the party, the Colombo mayor being the best example.?
?It is quite natural, in tough times to question the party leadership, especially when the party has performed poorly and when a reshuffle is around the corner,? Minister Fernando said when asked of his opinion on the challenges faced by the present leadership. ?But Ranil Wickremesinghe I believe is the most experienced person to handle this kind of pressure,? he added.
?Being a younger member of the party I have always made my stance clear and I have been penalised for doing so. However, I have never spoken against the party or spoken of its issues in public. These are internal affairs which need to be resolved internally. There are some who love the attention when they speak against the party and there are also media with vested interests who will thrust such issues in the spotlight. Therefore we must be careful with our words and actions,? Minister Fernando noted.
?We have rallied around the party and not around a person. There are several middle-aged people who are uncomfortable with change or what is about to happen. It is a difficult situation to be faced with. Which is why we must practice caution because it will ultimately reflect upon the party,? remarked the young Minister.
?I believe Ranil Wickremesinghe has too realised this and he too wants to move on. The UNP has very capable second and third tiers reinforced and he will make way for change and let go of the baton at the right time,? he noted.
Objective must be to bring back the confidence
	We had identified several mishaps on our part
	We have rallied around the party and not around a person
?
Leadership Should Accept Change
State Minister Vasantha Senanayake said he was unable to comment on the party reforms process as he was yet to see the report. Asked of what changes could be expected in the party, Minister Senanayake said the objective of attempting reforms was to drive change.
?But it does not necessarily mean that change will take place,? Minister Senanayake said.
?The Leadership of the party should understand that change is required and should be able to accommodate the necessary changes.?
?If the leadership is stubborn and refuses change, it will be impossible to make any significant impact at the next election. The results of the previous election have to be taken into account. If not we can expect an even more dismal performance at the next election,? he explained.
?

Minister Senanayake believes that the manner, in which the selection of leaders takes place, is an area that needs to be immediately addressed within the party structure.
?The choosing of leaders should take place in a more democratic method. We should also take a closer look at the people appointed from the national list. Meanwhile, personal appointments should also be looked into. Appointments should instead be allowed for districts with no Cabinet representations. And finally, young and emerging talent should be accommodated within the party,? the State Minister opined.
Personal appointments should be looked into
	Choosing of leaders should take place in a more democratic fashion
Several attempts to contact State Minister Harsha de Silva failed. However, the newly appointed State Minister taking to Twitter in February said that attempts to reform the UNP would continue, while denouncing reports of him crossing over to UPFA and reports of requesting Ranil Wickremesinghe to step down as party leader. His tweet on February 18 said ?True, I spoke on the need of changes in the @officialunp leadership but it is not true I asked @RW_UNP to step down as PM,?
On February 23 State Minister Harsha de Silva tweeted a photograph of a meeting captioned ?Sajith, Navin, Akila, Sujeewa and I (younger @officialunp group) tasked with a new plan going forward by @RW_UNP?.

SC to consider four petitions against Judicature Bill
	
The Supreme Court would consider four petitions against the Judicature Bill tomorrow under a three-member bench headed by Chief Justice Priyasath Dep.
Sri Lanka Bar Association, Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna?s Chairman Prof. G. L. Peiris, National University Teachers? Association Secretary Prof. Channa Jayasumana and Mahajana Eksath Peramuna leader Dinesh Gunawardane have petitioned the Supreme Court.
Prof.Peiris yesterday said the purpose of this Bill was to set up a special high court at bar permanently, with only the Attorney General and the Director General - Bribery to decide on the cases to be heard in it.
He said he decided to petition the Supreme Court along with others.
The leader of the Mahajana Eksath Peramuna filed a Petition that certain clauses of this Bill violate the provisions of the Constitution, alleging that the said Bill shall vest the 'executive' with arbitrary powers to decide as to whom to be tried before the proposed High Court and thereby deprive the citizens of equal application of the Criminal Procedure.
The petitioner further states that the judicial functions would be removed from the judiciary and entrusted with the ?executive?, amounting to the breach of the fundamental principle of separation of powers.
He also states it indirectly empowers the Attorney General and the Director General of the Bribery Commission to use the findings of the investigations carried out by purported ad hoc units of the police such as the Financial Crime Investigation Division (FCID), takes away the right of an accused to be represented by a Counsel of his choice and also seeks to take away the right of Attorneys-at-Law to engage in their professional practice.

SL thankful for China?s long term support: PM
	
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe yesterday thanked China for its long-term support to Sri Lanka's economic and social development and hoped that China's assistance and aid would benefit more at the grass root level.

Stephen Hawking, renowned scientist, dies at 76
	
?
REUTERS, 14th MARCH, 2018-? Stephen Hawking, who sought to explain some of the most complicated questions of life while working under the shadow of a likely premature death, has died at 76.
He died peacefully at his home in the British university city of Cambridge in the early hours of Wednesday.
?We are deeply saddened that our beloved father passed away today,? his children Lucy, Robert and Tim said in a statement.
Hawking?s formidable mind probed the very limits of human understanding both in the vastness of space and in the bizarre sub-molecular world of quantum theory, which he said could predict what happens at the beginning and end of time.
His work ranged from the origins of the universe, through the tantalizing prospect of time travel to the mysteries of space?s all-consuming black holes.
?He was a great scientist and an extraordinary man whose work and legacy will live on for many years,? his family said. ?His courage and persistence with his brilliance and humour inspired people across the world.?
The power of his intellect contrasted cruelly with the weakness of his body, ravaged by the wasting motor neuron disease he developed at the age of 21.
Hawking was confined for most of his life to a wheelchair. As his condition worsened, he had to resort to speaking through a voice synthesizer and communicating by moving his eyebrows.

Today is World Consumer Day MAKING FAIRER DIGITAL MARKETPLACES
	
World consumer day is the day the world consumer is expected to show consumer strength by organizing the membership worldwide initiated by the Consumer International. Sri Lanka takes part in a low profile as the consumer is not well organized as in other parts of the world, due to lack of leadership and inefficiency of the main consumer regulator expected to organize and catalyze the celebrations.?
The CAA, with enormous powers now given and with branches countrywide, is now in the process of?regularization of a market
	The Indian legal system complements consumerism with Consumer Courts and advanced jurisprudence and case laws on the subject
	How do you make digital regime fairer in Sri Lanka with outdated regulator CAA and fast developments in technology?
The strength of the consumer, who is also the citizen is education, activism and organization to engage in protecting and enhance the due rights and entitlements as the powerful group, not recognized and looked after by the regulator, trader, industrialist and the business community.
They say the consumer is a king and mighty powerful, who is always correct, well organized in the West with the help of the media, organizations and the State contributing for a fair consumer regime, while looking after the trader and industrialist.
In the United Kingdom the magazine ?WHICH? guides and protects the consumer, with the Department of Trade and Industry as the regulator supervising the consumer, protecting and safeguarding the citizen from providing them with quality consumer items at a reasonable price.
Trade Law including competition process and self-regulatory regime to avoid naming and shaming are direct and indirect methods of maintaining high standards of consumerism.
The EU consumer is protected by EU regulations applicable to EU countries. In Canada, Australia and even Latin American and African countries, consumerism is of high standards compared to Sri Lanka. Singapore and Hong Kong are so advanced the consumer is educated from the airport onwards.
The Indian legal system complements consumerism with Consumer Courts and advanced jurisprudence and case laws on?the subject.
Dhammika Perera said at his recent presentation in Colombo that online trend was settling to a mixture of online and storage (stores) worldwide again

Main Consumer Regulator
In Sri Lanka the main consumer regulator is the Consumer Affairs Authority (CAA) set up under Act No 9 of 2003 giving regulatory powers in place of traditional price control regime, with?controlled prices.
The CAA, with enormous powers now given and with branches countrywide, is now in the process of regularization of market.
The CAA is expected to initiate and promote consumer movement to organize the consumer and it is doubtful whether there is any consumer organization to assist the consumer in combating the cost of living and demand quality consumer goods and services at the quality at a reasonable price and standards.
The quality of goods services food and consumer items are substandard, adulterated, and of inferior quality due to lack of supervision and regulation by the CAA and other regulators such as TRCSL, Insurance and Trade Ombudsman, Public Health Inspectors, Local Councils, Health Department and many Statutory bodies.
With the advancement of technology, Sri Lankans are now at the doorstep of digitization with mobile phones in everybody?s hand and computer literacy of 40%.
The younger generation is now armed with excellent computer skills, and is able to use credit cards, advanced banking methods, and engage in modern technology via Facebook and other social media platforms for day-to-day life.
However in Sri Lanka online shopping is not in practice as in the United Kingdom and worldwide where 40% of the consumer items are purchased online.
Sri Lanka appears to be getting ready for a leap with the advanced applicability of modern technology in businesses and day-to-day transactions and the day will be not far when majority of the population makes its purchases online.
Uber a main digital application catering to millions of customers worldwide including Sri Lankans. These techs are expanding to bring blow drying and food chains to doorsteps which will revolutionize online purchasing further.
Sri Lanka has a Digital Minister linked to telecommunication having entered into a number of MOUs with foreign Governments and multinational companies on the introduction of digital advancements.
Digitization of Education has commenced by setting up digital classrooms which equip students and teachers with laptops and tabs.
On why consumer is not king in Sri Lanka but in the well organized West

Digital Regime
How do you make digital regime fairer in Sri Lanka with outdated regulator CAA and fast developments in technology?
And are we in the digital age or in the doorsteps? Are the issues to be resolved today?
Digitization in the world is fast with adverse effects of shedding billions of jobs, unlimited changes in lifestyles due to innovative changes making life easier.
However, these changes include the risk of health, other unexpected and undesirable changes in the economy.
Will Sri Lanka be affected by the ripple effect or to what extent it will invade Sri Lanka is a matter of time.
Digitization developments depend on the vision and the strategy of the State and the leaders of the?private sector.
?
Digital Market Places
Are digital marketplaces, which are thriving in the West has a foothold in Sri Lanka and the potential is very interesting considering the internet and mobile users are young.
The theme of?the year The theme of the year is appropriate to the rest of the world but not for Sri Lanka with limited penetration of the threat/prospects of the digital marketplace.
Experts predict saturated digital market in Sri Lanka in 10 years with innovative smart cities in line with Israel, Hong Kong, and UAE.
When 40% of the global population is online with 750 million global internet users, Sri Lanka will be finding it difficult to join the world out of necessity?
and compulsion.
Sri Lanka takes part in a low profile as the consumer is not well organized as in other parts of the world
?
Way out and?Future Strategy
Before making digital marketing fairer we have to make our existing system, which is inefficient and ineffectual to be advanced and compatible with the world trends according to the needs challenges and, requirements.
Chinese multi-national company Alibaba started by an English Teacher Hangzhou is the biggest retailer with 100 British Brands and with 440 million active clients, which is also protected by the UK Government (Gov.UK). Alibaba could be considered as a guideline for our Digital Ministry.
The energetic Minister should agitate for an appointment of an educated head for the CAA with the legal background as the Chairman.
Introduction of Microsoft 365 with cloud business transformation by commercial banks are in the right direction, However, it is good to be careful to maintain the balance on excessive growth.
It is time we encouraged and promoted our young entrepreneurs in line with the vision on the Israel Youth on innovations taking them up to the world standards on?
creative innovations.

Two Nawinna Ayurvedic Dept. officials nabbed for accepting bribe
	
Two officials attached to the Department of Ayurveda in Nawinna were nabbed by Bribery Commission sleuths yesterday in the act of soliciting a sum of Rs.50, 000 from an Ayurvedic medicinal producer.
An Assistant Legal Officer at the Department of Ayurveda and another official (member of Sutra Kamituwa) were caught red-handed as they were accepting the bribe at the former?s office last afternoon.
Director Bribery Commission Investigation Division SSP Priyantha Chandrasiri told Daily Mirror that these officials had taken the money from an Ayurvedic medicinal products manufacturer promising to renew his manufacturing permit.
An Ayurvedic products manufacturer from Danowita had lodged a complaint with the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption against the said officials a few days ago.
He had stated that when he had gone to get his permit renewed for the year 2018, the said officials had asked for a sum of Rs.300, 000 to get the process expedited.
The complainant had managed to negotiate with them to get the sum reduced to Rs.250, 000 and was asked to make an advance payment of Rs.50, 000 yesterday.
The issuing of permits to Ayurvedic product manufacturers and their renewals had previously been handled by the Ministry of Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine.
However, the responsibility to issue permits had been vested with the Department of Ayurveda from January this year, SSP Chandrasiri said.
The two accused were to be produced in the Colombo Chief Magistrate?s Court today (15). (Kurulu Koojana Kariyakarawana)
