Are you prone to Food Allergies?
	
?
?
Do you feel a sudden itching, swelling in the lips or abdominal pain within minutes or hours after consuming food? Then, perhaps you are prone to a food allergy. Peanuts, tree nuts, shrimp, milk and eggs are among the commonest types of food that could trigger food allergies in certain individuals. While the symptoms of food allergies could range between mild to severe (anaphylaxis), food allergies could occur regardless of age limit.?
Speaking to Mirror Medicine, Senior Lecturer of Food and Nutrition and the Head of the Department of Applied Nutrition from the Wayamba University of Sri Lanka, Dr. Anoma Chandrasekara explained how food allergies could affect the immune system while elucidating on the precautionary measures that could be taken against developing a food allergy.?
?
QWhat is a food allergy?
A food allergy is an adverse reaction of the body?s immune system to a type of food. Dr. Chandrasekara said such food allergies are a result of sensitivities caused by a reaction of the body?s immune system to specific proteins in the food. ??
?Allergens are almost always naturally occurring proteins found in food. Any food that contains protein has the theoretical potential to elicit allergic sensitization and, upon subsequent exposure, to cause an allergic reaction in the sensitive individual? Dr. Chandrasekara added. ? ?
?
QWhat are the symptoms related to developing a food allergy?
Elucidating on the symptoms evident in the body upon developing a food allergy, Dr. Chandrasekara pointed out that in allergic individuals, a food protein is mistakenly identified by the immune system as being harmful. ??
?The first time the individual is exposed to such a protein, the body?s immune system responds by creating antibodies; immunoglobulin E (IgE). When the individual is exposed again to the same food protein, IgE antibodies and chemicals (histamine) are released? she said. ??
In addition to the above, food allergies may include symptoms of nausea, hives, abdominal pain, swelling of the lips, face and tongue, dizziness and nasal congestion. ??
?
QAre food allergies a genetically associated health problem?
Stating that Celiac disease is a genetic disease giving rise to food allergies, she said the symptoms were triggered by the consumption of gluten. ?The main sources of gluten in the diet are cereal grains. The only current treatment for celiac disease is to continually maintain a strict gluten-free diet? she said. ??
?
QAre food allergies fatal?
Stating that food allergies can be fatal, Dr. Chandrasekara said any type of food could provoke an immune response in allergic individuals. However, she added that only certain foods were responsible for the majority of food allergies in individuals. She also said food allergies could occur at any age regardless of a vulnerable age group. ??
?
QWhat are the types of food that generally trigger a food allergy/ food poisoning in most people?
Peanuts, tree nuts (almonds, Brazil nuts, cashews, hazelnuts, macadamia nuts, pecans, pine nuts, pistachio nuts and walnuts), sesame seeds, milk, eggs, fish (including shellfish and crustaceans), soy, wheat and sulphites are food types that could generally trigger a food allergy/ food poisoning in individuals. ??
?
QWhat precautionary steps can an individual take to avoid being vulnerable to food allergies?
The only reliable means of treatment are avoidance diets according to Dr. Chandrasekara. ?Pharmacologic and other therapeutic methods of prevention of food allergies do not exist. Drugs such as epinephrine (adrenaline) and antihistamine can be used to treat symptoms that develop during an allergic reaction? Dr. Chandrasekara said. She also added that food-allergic individuals should ?read labels to avoid the offending foods and ingredients. ??

BIA runway closed for renovation
	
The main runway at the Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA) will be closed for renovation for three months from January 6, 2017, said Transport Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva, yesterday.
At a media briefing at the airport complex, the minister said the main runway of the airport would be closed for eight hours each day, from 8.30 am to 4.30 pm, for three months.
?The BIA runway was constructed in 1986. It is 3,350 metres long and 45 metres wide. The runway was guaranteed for 20 years or 20,000 flights -- whichever came first. According to the report of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) the runway passed its renovation date in 1996. The ICAO has repeatedly given reminders about this. The runway will not be suitable for use after year 2017,? he said.
He said planes could land and take off at the BIA for another year, according to the International Air Transport regulations.
?From 1996 onwards the previous governments have taken no steps to renovate the runway. There are about 177 flight per day involving 28 airlines. About 25,000 passengers use the airport and about 300 tonnes of goods are transported,? he said.
The runway is cracked and unsafe for flight operations, he said.
A Chinese company has undertaken the renovation project for 40 million dollars. It has been decided to widen and lengthen the runway to make it suitable for the largest aircraft, such as the A-380.
?The BIA will be closed for eight hours each day During that time a selected area of the runway will be renovated for four hours and allowed to cool for another four hours,? he said.
It is not possible to use the Mattala Rajapaksa International Airport (MRIA) as alternative while the BIA is closed, because the MRIA has no infrastructural facilities. No airline wants to use the MRIA because of the additional two hours transit time involved, he said. (Chaturanga Pradeep and T. K. G Kapila)

Healthy hair care
	
By Thusitha Malalasekara
Hair has long been an important aspect of beauty. Traditionally, women have paid great attention to the growth of hair, it?s strength, volume and shine. Strong and beautiful hair is a woman?s crowning glory and great pains are taken to ensure its health, be it the effort or the money spent. Caring for your hair is important. This article attempts to deliver some tips as to how you can care for your hair with a nutritious diet. ??
Just like any other organ, hair too is dependent on the food we consume. Your diet must consist of nutrients that will ensure the health and strong growth of hair. Hair is made of a tough protein called keratin. A hair follicle anchors each hair to the skin. The hair bulb forms the base of the hair follicle. Blood vessels nourish the cells in the hair bulb. Ensuring you have enough protein in your diet is crucial for making hair strong and healthy. If you are not consuming enough protein in your diet, your hair is likely to become dry, brittle and weak. Extremely low protein diets may result in hair loss. It is true that meats, fish, milk, egg and soy foods are rich in proteins. Consuming the required amount of these foods within the course of a week however might be problematic. Therefore foods like green gram, beans, legumes and lentils can fulfill the protein deficiency in your diet. In order to make sure that the amino acids in protein are absorbed into your body, choose rice or bread to compliment your vegetable proteins. ?
Your hair is approximately 91 percent protein. Therefore to strengthen the protein in your hair, a portion of red rice or brown bread and short eats made out of rice flour or whole grain flour can be consumed. Foods made out of grains such as kurakkan, oats and corns are also essential to your diet. ??
Iron is an especially important mineral for hair and too little iron (anaemia) is a major cause of hair loss. The hair follicle and root are fed by a nutrient-rich blood supply.?
When iron levels fall below a certain point, you may experience anaemia. This disrupts the nutrient supply to the follicle, affecting the hair growth cycle and may result in shedding. Animal products such as red meat, chicken, eggs and fish rich in oils provide iron with a high bioavailability, meaning the iron is readily available to the body. Vegetarians can raise their iron stores by including lentils, leafy green vegetables and leaves such as Gotukola, Mukunuwenna, Murunga (Drumstick tree leaves), Kathurumurunga (Agati leaves) and thampala. ??
Vitamin C aids the absorption of iron so foods high in vitamin C are good to eat in conjunction with iron-rich foods. Vitamin C is also an antioxidant so is used readily by the body.?
The best sources are lime, tamarind or biling juice which can be added to salads and curries. Consumption of fruits rich in Vitamin C such as oranges, papaya, guava, plantains and pineapple helps in the production of collagen that strengthens the capillaries that supply the hair shafts. ?
?
Omega-3 fatty acids are important fats our body cannot produce and therefore must be obtained through our diet. Omega-3s are found in the cells that line the scalp and provide the oils that keep your scalp and hair hydrated. Look out for oily fish and plant sources including avocado and pumpkin seed. ??
Vitamin A is needed by the body to make sebum. Sebum is an oily substance created by our hair?s sebaceous glands.A lack of sebum results in an itchy scalp and dry hair. Include animal products and orange/yellow coloured vegetables which are high in beta-carotene (which makes vitamin A) such as carrots, pumpkins and sweet potatoes. Regular consumption of these foods will act as a natural conditioner to your hair. ??
Biotin is a water-soluble B vitamin. Too little biotin can cause brittle hair and may lead to hair loss.?
Include biotin rich foods such as wholegrains, liver, egg yolk, salmon fish, corn, avocado, soy flour and low fat cheese in your meals for a balanced supply of B vitamins. Scalp protection involves other important minerals, notably zinc and selenium. A lack of zinc can lead to hair loss and a dry, flaky scalp.?
Fortified cereals and wholegrain are a good source of zinc along with peanuts, eggs and yoghurt. ?
?An overall balanced diet is necessary for a healthy scalp and healthy hair. To maintain the beauty and vigour of your hair, the regular intake of these foods with a balanced diet will make you the envy of those wishing for lustrous locks. ??

## Title: Heavy fine on illegal fishing is a EU requirement: Fisheries Ministry

Heavy fine on illegal fishing is a EU requirement: Fisheries Ministry
	
Imposition of a heavy fine on those who indulge in illegal fishing is a European Union (EU) requirement, and therefore, there is no way Sri Lanka can exempt Tamil Nadu fishermen from being fined heavily for poaching in Sri Lankan waters and using banned methods of fishing, the Secretary to the Sri Lankan Ministry of Fishing, Mrs.W.M.M.R.? Adhikari, told Express on Wednesday.
The high-ranking official said that a new tough law to regulate Sri Lankan and foreign fishing is in parliament and that it will be debated soon.
Adikari said that the measure has a ring of urgency about it because the European Union had imposed a ban on Sri Lankan fishermen for indulging in illegal fishing - a ban which was lifted recently after Sri Lanka promised to take steps to curb such fishing.
The new law would impose heavy fines on native and foreign fishermen who indulge in illegal fishing, she said.??? ?
The Sri Lankan Minister of Fisheries, Mahinda Amaraweera, had stated that Sri Lanka would impose a fine of LKR 150 million ( INR 7 crore) on Indian fishermen who fish in Sri Lankan waters and who also use trawlers which destroy marine resources.
Asked if a fine as high as LKR 150 million is being seriously considered, Adhikari said that the fine amount is being discussed but it will be heavy enough to be a deterrent.
Meanwhile, other official sources said that the next meeting of the India-Sri Lanka Joint Working Group on Fisheries (JWGF) will be held on December 30 or 31, either in Colombo or New Delhi. A visit to Colombo by the Indian Agriculture and Fisheries Minister Radha Mohan Singh on January 2 or thereabouts is also on the cards.
Significantly, the JEGF does not have representatives of the Tamil Nadu government. It has representatives from the Ministries of Foreign Affairs and the navies and coast guards of the two countries.
At the last JWGF meeting, India had, for the first time in the history of the fishing dispute, said that it will consider the Sri Lankan proposal for joint patrolling of the International Maritime Boundary Line (IMBL).
If joint patrolling is resorted to, the Indian Coast Guard and Navy will be sharing with Sri Lanka the onerous and sensitive responsibility of preventing poaching in the sea between the two countries.
According to the Sri Lankan Fisheries Ministry, the island nation is losing LKR 9 billion a year, as a result of poaching by Tamil Nadu fishermen.

Fifty Eight MPs are to hand over petitions to the President and the Prime Minister asking them to remove Nimal Bopage, the Secretary to the Ministry of Parliamentary Reforms and Mass Media from his post with immediate effect.
This development comes after Mr. Bopage said he would not sign the agreement to provide 58 MPs with new vehicles.
A government source said the MPs were of the opinion that Mr. Bopage should be removed from his post as he had worked against the Cabinet which had approved the proposal to provide the vehicles.
"The MPs are of the opinion that that Mr. Bopage should not be kept in his post any longer as he has challenged the government several times," the source said.
The MPs have asked why the secretary is preventing the acquisition of the vehicles when machinery is being put in place under which the government will become the owner of the vehicles. (Yohan Perera)

Old habits die hard The scooter that would always take me home, safely
	
o more motorcycles. Suddenly, I was back to taking the bus or train when travelling to Kandy. Or, when going with my family, I was just another frustrated driver steering a car, often stuck in a queue behind a lumbering container truck. It just didn?t feel right. ?
Until a few years ago, motorcycles were my main mode of transport out of Colombo. They were faster in heavy traffic, economical and much more fun for someone who prefered the cleaner air of hills and the rolling countryside to sitting inside an air-conditioned cocoon, whether mobile or stationary. ?
But the ?bike hikes? (as they were called back then) grew less and less, and then ceased altogether for a number of reasons. Petrol prices went up by 150%, and food too, in proportionately high amounts, and the politics of the time did not exactly leave me with the peace of mind needed to see travelling as a means of entertainment. Things got so bad that, when I got rid of my last motorcycle three years ago, I thought I?d never buy one again. ?
But old habits die hard. After regime change, the worst seemed to be over at least for now, and the urge to travel on two wheels returned. Instead of a motorcycle, though, this time I opted for a scooter. ?
The truth is that, while riding motorcycles for more than two decades, I always fancied a scooter. But I never bought one because the lure of motorbikes was too strong and the scooter already looked doomed back then. The days of Indian scooters were already numbered, with Bajaj tooling up to mass produce motorcycles. Japanese scooters looked like toys, and Italian Vespas seemed to be a thing of the past. ??
?
"The old Vespa hadn?t let me down, and here I was, Michael?s cat purring ?next to me and listening to the only saxophonist around for many miles, ?maybe in the entire district. Life is full of uncertainties, but I could ?be pretty certain of that at least."
?
Looking at what was available last year, it looked dismal. I?m not prejudiced against Indian motorcycles ? some of the new models are exciting, and quite reliable, but they all look alike. My heart is still with ageing Japanese bikes. What others dismiss as old and junk looks classic to me. This road naturally leads to a 1980s or 90s Japanese machine. ??
The trouble is that almost every such bike still running today needs overhauling, and spare parts are scarce. Incompetent, lazy and drunken mechanics make this equation unworkable. As for reconditioned machines, the new registration tax for Japanese motorcycles looks like highway robbery and puts them out of one?s reach. ?
Well, why not a scooter? Not one of the flashy new Indian scooters because ? well, everyone has one of those. Ego is involved here. Besides, they look like toys. India stopped making ?serious? scooters inspired by the classic Vespas long ago, but I began to eye the occasional Bajaj or LML Vespa puttering along clogged Colombo streets with increased longing. Somehow, that seemed the only way out to someone unwilling to accept the use-and-discard consumer realities of the modern world. ?
Scooters were a new world, though. Technically, I knew little about them, and the smaller tyres caused some concern. But I was by now hooked. Even as I tried during day time to talk my way out of getting into a mess, someone kept urging me in my sleep to buy a scooter. ?After searching the internet, it was a question of deciding between Bajaj and Vespa. Locations ranged from Matara to Jaffna. One 8 Sri Bajaj advertised from Matara was attractive, but the body needed work and it was a long way to go. Finally, I settled on a Vespa advertised from Minuwangoda because it looked the best out of the lot. The roads to motoring hell may often be glossed over with a nice coat of paint, but this time I was lucky. The price was right, and I got my ?second wind? as a rider thanks to this 1978 Vespa P150X. ?
Spare parts are available because the early Bajajs were based on this model, and that makes all the difference. Having dealt with all the minor problems, and gotten used to the peculiarities of scooter riding and starting, I was finally ready for a trip out of Colombo. ?
The road which turns to Kurunegala at Ambepussa and goes to Dambulla via Kurunegala is one of the most beautiful in the island. After widening, with many of the shady trees and old buildings gone, it has lost some of its character, but it still is a memorable ride. Leaving on Saturday just after 5 am, traffic was light as the Vespa rode through signs of urban expansion and chaos with imperturbable calm like the veteran that it was. ?
First stop was for a glass of ?kola kenda? (herbal drink) soon after Pasyala. The roadside ?caf?? is run by a retired Irrigation Department employee and his wife. His cheerful, charming manner as much as the quality of his drinks seem to attract brisk business, as several vehicles stopped during the ten minutes I spent there, and they were all his known customers. ?
My destination was close to Melsiripura, halfway between Kurunegala and Dambulla. Traffic was steady and neither painful nor menacing all along, perhaps because I had started early enough, though plenty of people in a hurry flew past me as I chug-chugged along at a steady pace. Even the road-widening stretches after Alawwa were not too bad. Alawwa town with its old bridge crowded with a languid, loitering pedestrian humanity seems immune to the development road roller, though the old cinema has got a face lift. ?
?
?
"I?m not prejudiced against Indian motorcycles ? some of the new models ?are exciting, and quite reliable, but they all look alike. My heart is ?still with ageing Japanese bikes. What others dismiss as old and junk ?looks classic to me."
?
?
?I was going to see Michael, an old friend who had returned home after twenty years abroad. He had learned to play the saxophone and was now managing a coconut estate there. ?
Development has caught up with Melsiripura town, no longer the sleepy backwater I remembered from twenty years ago. There is a supermarket, road widening, insurance companies and broad-fronted shops selling refrigerators and flat screen TVs. But it?s one-track development. There is neither a theatre, library or cinema nor a single square foot devoted to culture. I was glad to leave the town behind. ?
?Night came swiftly and sweetly. The road in front of the house was dark and quiet. Crickets chirped steadily. After dinner, Michael played his two saxophones in turn. One is an antique, 1910 American-made tenor sax which sounds gruff. The other is a new, Japanese alto sax, lighter and mellower in tone. As he played Sinhala and Hindi tunes, I could almost see a smiling genii floating out of the open saxophone mouth, waving a conductor?s baton. ?
It is an unfortunate fact that we need to sleep. As the night progressed with coffee and music, though, life didn?t seem so bad after all. The old Vespa hadn?t let me down, and here I was, Michael?s cat purring next to me and listening to the only saxophonist around for many miles, maybe in the entire district. Life is full of uncertainties, but I could be pretty certain of that at least. And I knew the Scooter would get me safely home the day after. Viva scooters and scooter wallahs. Look forward to more adventures with the Vespa. ?

Oral Cancer: Prevention and Awareness
	
By Haadiyah Marikar ??
Oral cancer appears as a growth or sore in the mouth that doesn?t go away and can be life-threatening if not treated in its early stages. ??
According to Assistant Secretary of the Sri Lanka Dental Association Dr. Vipula Wickramasinghe, oral cancer is the most common type of cancer found among Sri Lankan males. ? Among females it?s the 6th most common type. The main cause for this is chewing betel with arecanut and smoking tobacco. Other types of substances which people chew such as beeda and babul, commonly seen in highly populated areas in Colombo, can also cause oral cancer. Drinking alcohol is also one of the main causes, when people both drink and chew betel it aggravates their chances of getting oral cancer. There are also unknown factors that could cause this type of cancer, which are accountable to genetics. Although not seen in Sri Lanka, exposure to UV radiation can also be a cause? Dr. ?Wickramasinghe said. ??
He also said it mainly affected the middle-income group. It is seen mainly in people over 40 and is a common cancer among the middle-aged.? ??
Speaking of the awareness programmes and prevention methods conducted, Dr. Wickamasinghe said, ?There is a separate institution called the National Cancer Control Programme in Sri Lanka. Since oral cancer is the most common cancer in Sri Lanka, they have conducted many programmes in order to mitigate it, one being opportunistic screening, where doctors or health professionals go to certain areas and screen people for other illnesses but in which you can see the scores for oral cancer??.
??The most important factor is detecting oral cancer in its early stages, which is the target of this programme. If identified in its early stages, it can be cured simply, or the condition can be reversed by preventing the habits that cause and aggravate it. Secondly, there?s a model called the risk factor model. All dental surgeons in the country have been educated and trained to screen patients according to it. Through this, patients are screened and redirected to the appropriate specialized unit. According to the scores the model gives, patients are redirected to specialized units. Thirdly, we are conducting a programme to change the ingredients in the bulath heppuwa. Betel is a traditional leaf in our country and we cannot expect people to stop taking betel altogether. Thus keeping the bulath heppuwa in mind, we are conducting a programme to replace harmful substances such as arecanut and tobacco. A cancer register has also been introduced, where if a cancer is found anywhere, it has to be registered. Through banners and leaflets, we conduct awareness programmes in order to identify oral cancers in their early stages by doing a self-mouth examination. To conduct such an examination one must open their mouth before a mirror, wipe it with their finger and look for any abnormal colour change or any abnormal growth or longstanding wounds. School programmes are being conducted to make students aware of oral cancer, mainly to prevent them from taking tobacco and arecanut.?
We have expanded our services for cancer detection and early cancer treatment as well as late stage cancer treatment such as radiotherapy, surgery and chemotherapy, in surgery care institutions.We are in the process of making legislative changes on the importing of arecanut to Sri Lanka, because most of it is imported from Pakistan and other South Asian countries,? ?the expert opined.
? Dr. Wickramasinghe further advised, ?If a person is a betel chewer, they must stop as soon as possible. If you cannot stop at once, it needs to trail off because betel chewing with arecanut is the main cause for oral cancer in Sri Lanka.
?Secondly, conduct self-mouth examinations and if you see any abnormalities in your mouth go to a hospital and consult a dental surgeon, as it must be detected in its early stages. Thirdly, maintain proper hygiene by brushing twice a day with proper toothpaste. Finally, visit the dentist once in six months.? ??

The inspiring tale of a dauntless graduate
	
All expenses for Shalika?s education were bourne by her husband. Their only income is from cattle farming?
In Sri Lanka, where students marching on the streets demanding their right to education is a common sight, the story of Shalika Navodini Fernando is a far cry from it all.?
Thirty-one-year-old Shalika of Belwood, Galaha, graduated from the Pali and Buddhist ?University in 2013. Hers is a story of pure courage and a relentless desire to support her family through the only means she thought was possible; education.?
Having lived much of her life in the hilly estates of Delthota, Shalika?s will was unwavering in her pursuit of education, just like any other fresher she had hopes and dreams of a brighter future, not only for herself but also her husband and two sons. Instead, Shalika was driven to assist her husband in cattle farming - their only source of income.?
Her Bachelor of Arts degree, framed, hangs on the wall of her wattle and daub house. Following the revelation of her plight by our sister newspaper Lankadeepa, Shalika was granted employment by the National Apprentice and Industrial Training Authority (NAITA) as a Field Inspector. She must now undergo a ten-day training period before she takes up her official duties. Employment is certainly a blessing for Shalika who has been long-deserving of it. Yet, her struggles are far from over.?

"Having lived much of her life in the hilly estates of Delthota, Shalika?s will was unwavering in her pursuit of education"
Shalika with her husband Ranjith Priyashantha?
Born to W.G. Podimenike and L.G. Aldin, who were both workers at the Delthota Estate, Shalika was the youngest of the family, with two elder sisters and a brother. She studied until the fifth grade at the Galaha Sri Pushpadana Vidyalaya, till tragedy struck the happy family with the untimely death of her father. Shalika recounts the hardships her family had to endure following the demise of their beloved father. But she also recalls how her mother was persistent in ensuring Shalika and her siblings continued their studies. According to Shalika, her sisters and brother excelled in their studies but unfortunately could not pursue higher education due to financial constraints.?
Shalika, however, decided to continue her secondary education at Karagaskada Maha Vidyalaya, Delthota.?
?I selected the commerce stream to do my A/L?s. Back then, I had a dream to study in the IT field, to work with computers, but that was a mere dream,? Shalika recalls. ?After my A/L exams, I started work at an apparel factory in Kotahena. But I couldn?t work there for long as I was unaccustomed to the Colombo climate. I often fell sick and had to return home. I then started to work at a channelling centre in Peradeniya. It is during this period that I met my husband. Unlike many, he encouraged me to continue my studies and promised to help me.? ?On March 5, 2009, Shalika married H.D. Ranjith Priyashantha, a cattle farmer from her village. The same year, Shalika registered for the Bachelor of Arts degree at the Pali and Buddhist ?University with her husband?s blessings.?
?I woke up early every morning and came to Colombo to attend lectures. I had no money to attend extra classes or to buy the prescribed texts and other supplies I needed. If I told my husband about these requirements, he would have somehow given me the money. But I never told him. My husband has been rearing cattle for the past 16 years. I felt that I shouldn?t burden him anymore,? Shalika said.?
?
?
"After my A/L exams, I started work at an apparel factory in Kotahena. But I couldn?t work there for long as I was unaccustomed to the Colombo climate. I often fell sick and had to return home"
?
?I was fortunate to befriend two kind-hearted batch mates from Piliyandala and Kurunegala who helped me to a great extent. They gave me the necessary texts and other material. I studied Sinhala, Buddhist civilization and Mass Media at the university. I completed my degree in 2012. The day I graduated, I thought I was on top of the world. I was caught up in a world of possibilities and dreams. Most importantly, I realised the dreams of my parents and my beloved husband,? Shalika recounts as she wipes away a tear.?
Nevertheless, destiny was not in Shalika?s favour. She had been living at her sister-in-law?s house since her marriage. Upon the return of her sister-in-law to the island, Shalika and her husband had to leave the house. They decided to build a temporary shelter in a bare land belonging to her husband?s father.?
?My husband has studied up to A/Ls. But cattle farming is his occupation. Sometimes he works as a driver. We live in a land that is disputed by some of our family members. We don?t have a deed, so we can?t build a house,? Shalika explained.?
?That is why we built this shed out of wattle and daub. The cattle are sheltered on one side and on the other we made a little living space for ourselves. All four of us live here. But you never know when we will have to leave this land. The Galaha Veterinary officers tried to help us by giving us more cattle and aid. But we can?t afford to make those poor animals live in the same miserable conditions that we do. So we care for the four cows that we already have and manage our day-to-day expenses,? she said.?
?
?
"The day I graduated, I thought I was on top of the world. I was caught up in a world of possibilities and dreams. Most importantly, I realised the dreams of my parents and my beloved husband"
?
Her courage and determination to complete a three-year degree in such circumstances are nothing but commendable. In a small room where they eat, sleep and cook, Shalika also finds space to teach her eldest son who studies in the second grade of Pushpadana Vidyalaya, Galaha.?
?I teach my sons during the day time when there is light. At night, the elder son does his homework with the light of a torch. He has grown accustomed to studying in the dark. When the torch runs out of batteries, we light a chimney lamp and go on about our work. We had electricity some months back, but we can?t afford it anymore,? the mother of two lamented.?
In the shadows of Shalika?s success story is her husband Priyashantha who patiently endured great difficulties to finance his wife?s dreams. The sole breadwinner of the family engages in a number of odd jobs, apart from rearing cattle, to feed his two children. Now this family seeks to overcome their next obstacle; to build a house of their own. In an age where we grumble and complain about everything under the sun, Shalika and her family is an inspiration to us all.?

## Title: What happens to the heroin taken into custody?

What happens to the heroin taken into custody?
	
Over the past few months alone, newspapers have prominently reported on a number of massive hauls of heroin nabbed by law enforcement authorities. These range from the massive hundreds of kilos (to the latest haul reported just a few days ago), quantities which vary from one kilo upwards, detected with increasing frequency and estimated conservatively at a market value running into several billion rupees. In addition, there are the smaller quantities detected almost daily in the possession of sundry drug traffickers. The public would quite naturally be curious as much as they are anxious to know what has become of these huge hauls of the drug illicitly smuggled and taken into custody by the concerned State authorities.
?
The public have every right to enquire and find out more information, considering the mind-boggling quantities interdicted, particularly in view of the burgeoning, astronomical market value involved. This has been a perennial question posed repeatedly over the years, and answered smugly by the concerned authorities with the exasperatingly, peremptory and unconvincing reply - ?destroyed!? Destroyed, at what stage, how, where and under whose close supervision and certification; are the nagging questions that arise in the public mind.?
Proposal to destroy the drug detected, on the spot - ?in situ??
When this writer functioned as an ex-officio member of the National Dangerous Drugs Control Board (NDDCB) some years ago, the matter was taken up at a Board meeting as there had been cases reported, where it was revealed that a quantity of heroin kept as evidence to be produced in Court, had ?magically? transformed itself into talcum powder.?
After a quantity of a drug is nabbed and taken into custody by the Police, it is routinely handed over to the Government Analyst (GA) to check and report on its quality and purity. It is thereafter handed back to the Police for safekeeping and produced in Court when the particular case is called.?
Suspicions of adulteration and the spiriting away of quantities of the drug, invariably led to the never-ending blame game where the two State authorities concerned refused to take responsibility for any alleged adulteration.?
The writer on his own initiative recommended the NDDCB that the best safeguard to prevent the drug leaking back into the market would be to have it destroyed at the point of interdiction. To satisfy court, it was recommended that immediately an illicit consignment was nabbed, the magistrate of the division, the GA or his representative and the SSP of the division be summoned to the spot for the haul to be examined by them, with the GA duly weighing and testing the drug to ascertain its purity.?
The drug was to be destroyed thereafter ?in situ,? in the presence of the three officials referred to. A certificate was to be signed by the three parties testifying to the correctness of the weight and the purity of the drug. It was also recommended that an amendment be brought in to the relevant law enabling court to accept the veracity of the certificate so issued.?
?
?
"One feels strongly that it is about time Sri Lankans woke up to the stark reality that if the illicit dangerous drugs problem not confronted purposefully and effective measures to curb its spread island-wide were not taken urgently, this little island of ours is bound to face the grave danger of the problem turning into a veritable national disaster enervating the vital energies of our youth while concurrently undermining the social, political and economic stability of the island"
?
A Board resolution was passed unanimously endorsing my proposal. Consequently another Board member and I were assigned the task of meeting the Judicial Services Commission (JSC) and placing the resolution of the NDDCB before them.?
Accordingly, I met certain members of the JSC with the other nominated Board member and discussed the problem and the proposals we had submitted to ensure the quantities detected were destroyed under the supervision of the three State officials referred to.?
The JSC officials, whilst lauding the safeguards, proposed to ensure that nothing of the nabbed drug leaked back into the market, and added that the implementation of the proposals would require certain amendments to existing legislation on which some of the proposals impinged.?
They also agreed to take the matter up with the Justice Ministry and other concerned law enforcement authorities. ?I left the NDDCB soon afterwards and lost track of the follow-up action taken (if any), on the matter, thereafter. I do hope the matter was pursued by the concerned authorities with a view to ensuring that the required safeguards were properly formulated to prevent adulteration and the possibility of the drug being leaked back into the market. ?In view of the increasing frequency of detections made, the substantial hauls interdicted and the massive amount of money involved, it may be best for the authorities to make public the precautionary measures that are in place, to effectively prevent adulteration and the drug being clandestinely taken out and sold in the market.?
Further, it may also assuage the public to know the manner in which the drugs are kept in safe custody and most importantly, the strict procedures laid down for the final destruction of these drugs. This is of critical importance as it concerns vitally the health and well-being of the younger generation as well as the short and long term national well-being of the country as a whole.?
One feels strongly that it is about time Sri Lankans woke up to the stark reality that if the illicit dangerous drugs problem not confronted purposefully and effective measures to curb its spread island-wide were not taken urgently, this little island of ours is bound to face the grave danger of the problem turning into a veritable national disaster enervating the vital energies of our youth while concurrently undermining the social, political and economic stability of the island.?
?
?
"Suspicions of adulteration and the spiriting away of quantities of the drug, invariably led to the never-ending blame game where the two State authorities concerned refused to take responsibility for any alleged adulteration"
?
As the problem of drug addiction has assumed epidemic proportions, it is imperative to take urgent action to curb it. As pointed out by this writer earlier in some explicitly spelt out articles on the subject published recently in the Daily Mirror, the back of this lucrative illicit trade could be broken only by - 1) breaking up the ?unholy? nexus between certain unscrupulous politicians who profit by the trade and underworld characters and their accomplices who smuggle in the drugs and organise their distribution through island-wide networks; 2) by eliminating laws delays and facilitating the expeditious disposal of illicit drug cases; 3) by the imposition of the severest punishments on those convicted viz, the death penalty, confiscation of their assets etc (the death penalty if not implemented, poses no deterrent) and 4) by conducting carefully formulated prevention programmes in schools and workplaces.?
In the final analysis, what is of crucial importance is the unswerving political will and the deep and abiding commitment of the powers that be to save this land of this diabolical menace. ?
