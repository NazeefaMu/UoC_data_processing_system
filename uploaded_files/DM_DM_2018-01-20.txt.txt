Cancer breakthrough Medication targets cancers survival mechanism
	

A cancer drug is in development that could stop the disease in its tracks. 
The unnamed medication targets a specific enzyme that fuels the spread of tumours, new research reveals. 
It does this by binding to the membrane of rapidly multiplying cells, a European study found. 
This hijacks cancers survival mechanism and prevents tumours from attaching to the protein they need to thrive. 
Around 357,000 people get diagnosed with cancer every year in the UK. The anti-cancer drug binds to cancerous cells membrane protein, known as dehydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH). 
Study author Dr. Erik Marklund, from Uppsala University, said: Our simulations show the enzyme uses a few lipids as anchors in the membrane. When binding to these lipids, a small part of the enzyme folds into an adapter that allows the enzyme to lift its natural substrate [the substance an enzyme acts on] out of the membrane. 
It seems the drug, since it binds in the same place, takes advantage of the same mechanism. 
Study author Sir David Lane, from the Karolinska Institute, in Sweden, added: The study helps to explain why some drugs bind differently to isolated proteins and proteins that are inside cells. 
By studying the native structures and mechanisms for cancer targets, it may become possible to exploit their most distinct features to design new, more selective therapeutics. 
It is unclear when the drug could be available.

Chinas people-centred development
	

The Communist Party of China (CPC) has met every five years since 1921 to hold its National Congress. The party which commenced with fifty members is has a membership of 89 million today. Now its has 4.5 million party branches throughout China. In other words, it has become the worlds greatest political party. 
At this party congress they evaluate the quantum of work done during the last five years and then elect new leaders of the party for next five years. New leaders will deliver the programme of work they will carry forward during the next five years. 
The 19th party congress was held at Beijing commencing on October 18, 2017. At this congress, Chinese President Xi Jinping gave an analytical description of work done during the last five years. Chinas economy has been transitioning from medium to high-speed growth in the last five years. The average annual GDP growth rate from 2013 to 2016 was 7.2%, higher than the average rate 2.6% of the world economy and 4% of other developing countries. Chinas total GDP of 73.7 trillion yuan (USD 11.2 trillion) in 2016 accounted for 14.8% of the world economy. It is obvious that China has passed very successful five years. The initiatives taken since 2012, especially the economic reforms, the Chinese dreams, the Belt and Road initiative and anti-corruption campaign account for the rapid development. 

The average annual GDP growth rate from 2013 to 2016 was 7.2%, higher than the average rate 2.6% of the world economy and 4% of other developing countries. Chinas total GDP of 73.7 trillion yuan (USD 11.2 trillion) in 2016 accounted for 14.8% of the world economy.

At this congress, Xi Jinping was re-elected as the General Secretary of CPC. Also, this congress accepted his position as equivalent to the position held by Chinese great leaders Mao Zedong and Deng Xiaoping. He then laid down CPC future vision and programmes till 2050. The new theme has been branded as Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a new era. The base for this new conception is Marxism, Leninism and Mao Zedong thoughts, Deng Xiaoping theories as well as Xi Jinpings thoughts. CPCs aim is to arrive at this target in 30 years and they laid different steps to achieve this. 
The first step is to turn China into a Moderately Prosperous Society in all aspects by 2020 (Xiaokang in Chinese). China has planned to eradicate poverty completely by 2020. CPC will celebrate his 100-year anniversary in 2021. They have eliminated nearly 800 million people from poverty during the last four decades. During Xi Jinpings last five years, they have managed to eliminate poverty among 100 million people. The balance of some 50 million will be eliminated from poverty in 2020. This will be a landmark achievement of great China. 
Their aim is to establish a modern socialist country by 2050 and to convert China into a prosperous, strong, culturally-advanced, harmonious and beautiful country. Xi Jinping said at the collective study session of the CPC central committee political bureau in Beijing on December 8, 2017, At the present stage, the basic feature of Chinas economic development is the transition from a phase of rapid growth to a stage of high-quality development. According to CPCs new vision, after 2020, every Chinese product should be eco-friendly and of high-quality. Human resources of the country should also be developed. Fiscal control should be brought to a sound level.All provinces of China should be equally developed. China will accelerate introducing innovations to the world. In the past, China has introduced many innovations to the world. Gunpowder, paper, printing and compasses are few of them. How China developed its speed train service during the last ten years stands testimony to this. Today, the most advanced high-speed train service is found in China. More than 24,000 kilometres are served by this train that travels at a speed of 300-350kmph. In America, a high-speed train could reach only 170kmph. President Xi Jinping pointed out in his report delivered to the 19th National Congress of the CPC that innovation was the primary force driving development and the strategic underpinning for building a modernised economy. Very recently, Mr. Yang Yuanqing, CEO of Lenovo said, unlike in the past, China is no longer just a factory for the world, but makes as important contribution to global innovation.
Xi Jinping who rose to power in 2012 has managed to create much discipline in the country. Even at the 19th congress, he stressed the importance of creating discipline within the party and the country. He said corruption was a great hindrance for development. He insisted government servants to investigate the instances of misusing State funds. Some 240 high-ranking officials and about a million of ordinary officials have been investigated for corruption charges since 2012. 
For the first time in June, the CPC completed inspections within a five-year administrative term, covering CPC organisations in provincial level, Central CPC and government organs, major State-owned enterprises, central financial institutions and universities. Today, China speaks of the wellbeing of other friendly nations.The One Belt One Road initiative put forward by Xi Jinping in 2013 is a good example of this. Significant infrastructure development will take place in countries that come under this plan. It will make the economies of these countries stronger and with that in mind China has created the Silk Road Fund and the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank.China has expanded freight train services to Europe under the One Belt One Road concept. As a result, Chinese goods arrive at European markets quickly and vice versa.
I would like to remind our former Foreign Minister Lakshman Kadirgamars statement about Sri Lanka-China bilateral ties. He said, When a relationship is based on mutual respect and affection, the size, importance and power of one of the two countries in that relationship does not have a disproportionate influence on the other. China has never sought to influence the domestic politics of Sri Lanka. Over the years, China has proved to be benign and sincere with no ulterior motives for befriending Sri Lanka. She has never tried to dominate undermine or destabilise Sri Lanka.
The leaders of China who assumed office after the Peoples Republic of China was created in 1949 formulated their policies for the well-being of their people. They will definitely eradicate poverty by 2020. This is a message given to the entire world where poverty is rampant. By 2050, they have formulated policies to make every Chinese a happy and a content man. In 2049, they will celebrate the centenary of the creation of the Peoples Republic of China. By then, the people of China would be one of the prosperous persons living in this world.

EC says no power to unseat elected candidates
	
Elections Commission Chairman Mahinda Deshapriya said on Thursday he could do nothing about unseating a field officers or any other candidate if he had been found to have illegally contested the Local Government election and was elected.
Mr. Deshapriya said unseating of an elected candidate could only be done through a court procedure and added that elections commissions had no provision to do so.
He said there were no legal barriers for field officers to contest the election if he had resigned from the post as he was no longer a government servant.
However, officers attached to the Local Government bodies cannot do so even after they resign. We will not hesitate to take action against such officers, he said.
Mr. Deshapriya said they had no powers to cancel the nomination of candidates who had allegations against them even though some people wanted them to do so. (Ajith Siriwardana)

Honey, theres something in the bed and it just bit me
	

Australia, (Daily Mail), 19 January 2018 - A snake has slithered its way into bed to snuggle up with a North Queensland couple before the husband caught it in a pillowcase.
Adele Mallard, from Rangewood west of Townsville, was asleep on Tuesday morning when she rolled over onto the reptilian intruder.
When she bumped into the serpent it tried to bite her in the hamstring area, she said, waking her up immediately. I was like hon, theres something in the bed, it just bit me as I slid across to the other side, she told The Townsville Bulletin.
My hubby caught him with a pillowcase. 
Ms. Mallard asked local snake catchers for help identifying the reptile, and David Barwell obliged. Its a harmless spotted python, he said.
She said the snake has been rehomed, and although the couple struggled to get back to sleep afterwards due to the adrenaline rush, she is glad it was not a spider.
My biggest fear is spiders actually, so I guess I tell myself it could be worse, it could have been a spider, she said.

JO asks president's sec. -Are the two bond reports the same
	
The joint opposition (JO) yesterday asked Presidential Secretary Austin Fernando to clarify whether the bond report that was published was the same as the report which he received from the Bond Commission.
MP Ranjith De Zoysa told a news conference that the report given to Parliament and published online lacks a number of facts and pages in comparison with the original report.
We request the presidential secretary to make a statement within 24 hours whether the bond report he received was published intact without removing any facts. When concerned civil society organisations had asked the Speaker whether he had published the entire report, the Speaker has said yes. Therefore, now its up to the presidents secretary to issue a statement and remove any doubts. Otherwise, it leaves room to wonder whether the Prime Minister had swept the facts under the carpet, he said.
The MP said the Premier continued to deny that a fraud had taken place in the Central Bank during the 100-day programme and even afterwards.
Quoting the Pitipana committee report, the Prime Minister said nothing has happened. He said Arjuna Mahendran was a great Lankan son and that the Rajapaksa regime was slinging mud at him for being a member of the minority. Today, the Premier says Perpetual Treasuries Limited (PTL) funds have been frozen. This is not enough, action should be take against the wrongdoers, the he said.
Commenting on the Presidents statement that he will step down from the presidency after punishing corrupt politicians, the MP said because the Presidents term expires in November next year swift action should be taken as soon as possible. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

Kerala woman strangles 15-year-old son
	

Kollam, (Hindustan Times), 19 Jan 2018 - A 45-year-old woman, said to be mentally unstable, was on Thursday arrested after admitting that she had killed her 15-year-old son for allegedly teasing her, police said.
Jayamol, a housewife who was detained for questioning on Wednesday, on Thursday said she had killed her son Jeethu Job by first pushing him down in the kitchen and then strangled him with a shawl, said police. She then tried to conceal her crime by setting the body on fire.
The woman had, three days back, approached the local police stating that her son was missing but it was only on Wednesday that police located Jeethus half-burned body near their house in a rubber estate.
Later, police found that Jayamol had burns on her hand, and after further questioning, she admitted of having done the crime.
Her husband Job V. John told the media that she was mentally unstable and she did the extreme step after she was teased by the boy.
The last rite of the boy were conducted on Thursday evening at their local church.

Marapana Committee worse than Pitipana Committee: JVP
	
JVP MP Sunil Hadunnetti said yesterday the appointing of a committee headed by Minister Tilak Marapana to recommend action in the event any UNPer was involved in the Central Bank bond scam was worse than appointing the Pitipana Committee to probe bond scam.
He said the minister was the first person in the present government to resign from his portfolio because of his alleged involvement in Avant-Garde incident and was a national list MP appointed by UNP leader Ranil Wickremesinghe.
Will the minister hold the Prime Minister, who brought him to parliament, responsible for the scam Mr. Marapanas brother is the lawyer appearing for Perpetual Treasuries Ltd on behalf of Arjun Aloysius. It is like Horage Ammagen Pena Ahanawa Wage How we can expect any justice from him, the MP said.
He said any attempt to clear anyone from the bond scam would further establish their involvement in the scam.
Every attempt made to get away from the scam has been futile. It will further establish their involvement in the scam. If the recommendations of the Bond Commission were implemented, all the politicians and officials held responsible by the commission would be found guilty, the MP said.
He said if the COPE committee had not revealed the scam and made its recommendations, this scam would have been swept under the carpet. (Ajith Siriwardana)

US shutdown begins as Senate fails to pass budget
	
The US government has begun a federal shutdown after the Senate failed to agree on a new budget, the BBC reported today.
Despite last minute bipartisan meetings, the Bill to fund the government until 16 February did not receive the required 60 votes.
It is the first shutdown ever to happen while the same party, the Republicans, controls Congress and the White House.
In response, the White House accused Democrats of holding "lawful citizens hostage over their reckless demands".
"They put politics above our national security, military families, vulnerable children, and our country's ability to serve all Americans", spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said.
But Democratic Senate leader Chuck Schumer said President Donald Trump had turned down two bipartisan compromise deals and "did not press his party in Congress".
It was unclear which way the vote would go as the midnight deadline approached, with Republicans and Democrats split on key issues.
The House of Representatives voted 230-197 on Thursday night to extend funding until next month, but the measure failed to pass the Senate by a margin of 50-49.
Five Republicans voted against the Bill while five Democrats broke ranks to support it.
The last US shutdown happened in 2013 and lasted for 16 days, during which many federal employees took a forced leave of absence.
Many government offices will close as federal law requires agencies to shut down if Congress has not allocated money to fund them.
National parks and monuments are also likely to face closure.
But essential services will still run. These include national security, postal services, air traffic control, inpatient medical services, emergency outpatient medicine, disaster assistance, prisons, taxation and electricity generation.

US to grant Rs.183 mn to counter human trafficking in SL
	
The US government will grant more than Rs.183 million ($1.2 million) to counter human trafficking in Sri Lanka during the next three years, the US Embassy said on Friday.
It said the US State Departments Bureau of South and Central Asian Affairs would award the new project Equipping Sri Lanka to Counter Trafficking in Persons (EQUIP) to the International Labor Organization (ILO) Country Office for Sri Lanka and Maldives.
US Ambassador Atul Keshap applauded the effort saying the US has a strong commitment to working with international partners to tackle the root causes of modern slavery and protect victims and vulnerable populations.
Through the EQUIP project, we will continue to support the government of Sri Lanka in combating the scourge of human trafficking, he said.
ILO Country Director Simrin Singh said this is a timely opportunity for the ILO to step up efforts to combat human trafficking
Well-known ILO tools on Fair Recruitment and the application of recommendations of ILO Conventions and Protocols on Forced Labor will make a positive dent in tackling the challenges at national and grass root levels, she said.
EQUIP will directly assist Sri Lankan men, women and children who are at risk and those who are victims of human trafficking. The project will work closely with policy makers, law enforcement, recruitment agents, trade unions and business entities to amplify the impact of interventions and achieve lasting change, the statement said.
