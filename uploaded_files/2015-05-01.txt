<U+200B>Death sentence for killing Lankan mistress
	
A Sri Lankan in Bahrain, who murdered his mistress while his wife was abroad on holiday, has been sentenced to death.
Henry Josten De Silva, a Sri Lankan national, killed Prilica Kumari, 45, who also a Sri Lankan after he accused her of being unfaithful, according to prosecutors.
The Sri Lankan victim had told her friends, hours before she was murdered on March 1, 2012, that the 39-year-old hacked into her Facebook account because he suspected her of having an affair with another man.?
That same day, the defendant offered to take the woman home from work, where he beat her and strangled her using his bare hands.
He then carried her dead body into the kitchen, turned on the gas and lit a candle to make it look like she died in a blaze.
However, he failed to set the apartment alight because neighbours alerted authorities about the strong stench of gas.
?Investigations revealed that the defendant and the victim were in a relationship and he stole a land belonging to her in Sri Lanka,? read court verdict documents.
?According to prosecution wit- nesses, the defendant travelled to Sri Lanka with his wife and children but returned to Bahrain on his own and stayed with the victim.
?Their relationship took a turn for the worse when he learnt that the victim was in a relationship with another man.
?They started to argue about the issue and he threatened he was going to leave Bahrain if she did not break up with her new lover.
?The defendant then planned to murder the victim before picking her up from work. He beat her and struck her on the head before strangling her with his bare hands.
?He then set part of her clothes on fire using a candle after turning on the stove to make it look like she died in a blaze.
?However, he failed to set the apartment ablaze when neighbours reported smelling gas.?
Ms Kumari, who worked as a maid in an apartment building in the Seef District, died of suffocation, according to a medical examiner?s report.
Her friend told prosecutors that the victim confided in her about her boy- friend?s suspicions hours before she was killed.
?She came to me at work and said she was in a relationship with a married man who suspected her of cheating on him,? the Indian maid said in her statement to the Public Prosecution.
?She told me that he hacked into her Facebook account. She seemed worried.?
It is understood that the defendant, who worked for a pest control company, has fled the country and the High Criminal Court yesterday sentenced him to death in absentia. (Gulf Daily News)

Five jailed in The Hague for supporting LTTE
	
Five Dutch nationals of Sri Lankan origin have been jailed for between 19 months and six years three months for raising money for the Tamil Tigers (LTTE), Dutch News reported yesterday.
The appeal court ruled the five, who range in age from 43 to 60, were members of the LTTE and had raised money for the terror group between 2003 and 2010. This involved threatening people who refused to make donations and organising illegal lotteries, the court said.
A lower court in 2011 found the five guilty of membership of a criminal organisation but not guilty of being members of a terrorist organisation.
The Tamil Tigers have been on the EU?s official list of terrorist organisations since 2006. The group has been fighting for what it calls Tamil Eelam, an independent state for Tamils on the island of Sri Lanka, since the 1970s.

Give another chance to the people-Anura Kumara
	
		 		 
		 
			
JVP leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake today urged President Maithripala Sirisena to dissolve parliament soon and give another chance for the people to elect suitable parliamentarians, while requesting the president not to listen to those who opposed him earlier including present Opposition Leader Nimal Siripala.
Addressing the mammoth crowd at the JVP May Day rally at the BRC grounds the JVP Leader accused the coalition government of displaying their inability to govern a country as a coalition. He also said that the enactment of the 19th Amendment to the Constitution was a historical victory for Sri Lankans but the President had to offer ministerial posts as bribes to parliamentarians to get their votes in favour. ?The Hyde Park Grounds where the SLFP May Day rally is being held was not used even for small meetings of the JVP. It shows how the people have been disappointed over the other political parties?, Mr. ?Dissanayake said.
JVP General Secretary Tilvin Silva told the crowd that the ongoing political situation in the country, has proved that the JVP was the only political party which could be trusted by the people.
?Today, people are holding May Day rallies without knowing the real meaning of this day. They misuse May Day to fulfil their personal agendas. Some try to elect former President Mahinda Rajapaksa who defrauded state money with the support of his family members. They never stood for the working class,? Mr. Silva alleged.
The JVP also accused parliamentarians including Vasudewa Nanayakkara and Dinesh Gunawardene of working hard to get the former president back to active politics, describing them as politically displaced characters. The Red May demonstration of the JVP commenced its march from S. de S Jayasinghe Grounds in Dehiwela and reached B.R.C. grounds with a big crowd representing all Ceylon Trade Unions of Farmers?, Fishermen?s, Women?s, Youths, Students and Artistes.
The rally was chaired by All Ceylon Trade Union Federation President Lal Kantha, JVP leader Anura Dissanayake, General Secretary Tilvin Silva, Information Secretary Vijitha Herath and Politburo Member Sunil Handunneththi.(Piyumi Fonseka)

How JR Jayewardene Ushered in the Executive Presidency in 1978
	
By D.B.S. Jeyaraj
The successful passage of the 19th Amendment to the Constitution in Parliament with an overwhelming majority has resulted in the executive presidency ushered in by the 1978 Constitution losing some if not all? of? its powers. This in turn has focused the spotlight on Sri Lanka?s first? executive president? Junius Richard? Jayewardene known generally as JR.
?As is well-known it was JR who masterminded the? change of? Sri Lanka?s political system? from? the British Westminster model to that of one closely resembling the French Gaullist Constitution. Power shifted to the President who was transformed from a figurehead to an effective head of state. The post of Prime Minister was devalued in the process.
The presidential system? introduced by JR Jayewardene has a long history. When JR was Minister of State in the UNP government of Dudley Senanayake (1965-70) he made a ground-breaking? speech at the Association for the Advancement of Science. JR Jayewardene in his keynote address of December 14, 1966 outlined his vision for an executive presidency and argued in favour of a presidential system based on the US and French models.
?The executive will be chosen directly by the people and is not dependent on the legislature during its period of existence, for a specified number of years. Such an executive is a strong? executive seated in power for a fixed number of years, not subject to the whims and fancies of an elected legislature; not afraid to take correct but unpopular decisions because of censure from its parliamentary party,? he said.
JR?s advocacy of an executive presidency sent? shock waves down the political establishment at the time. Relations between Prime Minister Dudley Senanayake and? State Minister JR Jayewardene had deteriorated by then. Dudley was firmly opposed to the idea. There were few takers for JR?s proposal even within the United National Pary (UNP). In that environment JR was unable to push his proposal further but never let go of his vision.
	Constituent Assembly
The next chance came six years later during the United Front (UF) government of Sirimavo Bandaranaike (1970-77). Parliament had converted itself into a Constituent Assembly to draft a new Constitution. JR was then the leader of the opposition while Dudley Senanayake remained leader of the UNP. Differences between both had escalated and JR was almost a ?lone wolf? within the party at that time.
On July 2, 1971, JR moved a resolution in the Constituent Assembly. It read as follows: ?The executive power of the state shall be vested in the President of the Republic, who shall exercise it in accordance with? the provisions of the Constitution. The President of the Republic shall be elected for seven years for one term only by the direct vote of every citizen over 18 years of age. The President of the Republic shall preside over the council of ministers?. JR?s motion was seconded? at the Constituent Assembly by Ranasinghe Premadasa who was then the Colombo Central MP and Chief Opposition Whip.
?
	"JR argued eloquently, within the Constituent Assembly, in support of an executive presidency. The motion was shot down. Constitutional Affairs Minister Dr. Colvin R de Silva led the government onslaught against JR?s proposal. Even a majority of UNP parliamentarians were not supportive because? party leader Dudley Senanayake himself? was firmly opposed to the idea. The JR-Premadasa motion was rejected by the then Constituent Assembly"
JR argued eloquently, within the Constituent Assembly, in support of an executive presidency. The motion was shot down. Constitutional Affairs Minister Dr. Colvin R de Silva led the government onslaught against JR?s proposal. Even a majority of UNP parliamentarians were not supportive because? party leader Dudley Senanayake himself? was firmly opposed to the idea. The JR-Premadasa motion was rejected by the then Constituent Assembly.
The UF government brought in the new Republican Constitution on May 22, 1972. The Governor General under the Soulbury Constitution gave way to the President. As a result Power was vested in Parliament known then as the National State Assembly and while President William Gopallawa was the titular head of state, the real power was retained by Prime Minister Sirimavo Bandaranaike.
Dudley Senanayake passed away in 1973 and JR succeeded him as UNP leader. He soon established his leadership position and brought the party under his full control. JR was now able to pursue his vision of an executive presidency from a strong position.
?
	UNP Manifesto
The UNP manifesto of 1977 stated, ?Executive power will be vested in a President elected from time to time by the people. The Constitution will also preserve the parliamentary system we are used to and the Prime Minister will be chosen by the President from the party that commands a majority in Parliament and the ministers of the cabinet would also be elected members of Parliament.?
The? change to an Executive President from Prime Ministerial system was a key aspect of the UNP electoral campaign in 1977. The UNP swept the polls and obtained 141 out of the 168 parliamentary seats. JR Jayewardene became Prime Minister in July 1977. He began moving fast towards the? his cherished vision of an?? executive presidency.
JR and a small group of? ministers and party stalwarts in association with leading lawyer Mark Fernando started working towards? the goal of? introducing the executive presidency. The preliminary discussion was on August 7, 1977. An amendment to the Republican Constitution of 1972 was first drafted. After discussions in Cabinet it was approved and certified by the Cabinet as ?urgent in the national interest?.
Thereafter it was sent? by the Speaker to the Constitutional Court? which prevailed at that time, as an ?urgent bill?. The Constitutional? Court approved the bill within 24 hours as stipulated. It was then presented to the National State Assembly for debating and voting. The bill? was adopted by the then National State Assembly on September 22, 1977 as the Second Constitutional Amendment. Executive power was transferred to the President and JR Jayewardene became the first Executive President of Sri Lanka on Independence Day, February 4, 1978.
?
	Select Committee
Meanwhile JR was also working towards the goal of replacing the 1972 Constitution? in its entirety with a new one. On October 20, 1977 the National State Assembly passed a resolution enabling the then Speaker Anandatissa de Alwis to appoint a Select Committee for Constitutional Reform. The essence of the select committee mandate was, ?To consider the revision of the Constitution of the Republic of Sri Lanka and other written law as the committee may consider necessary.?
The Parliamentary select committe was announced on November 3, 1977. Initially the chairman was? JR Jayewardene who was then representing Colombo West in Parliament. JR however had to vacate Parliament as an MP? in February 1978 after he was sworn in as President. Ranasinghe Premadasa who was also serving in the select committee was then appointed chairman on February 23, 1978 by the Speaker. Mr. Premadasa was also appointed Prime Minister.
Other MP?s? from the UNP in the select committee? were Gamini Dissanayake, Lalith Athulathmudali, Ronnie de Mel, KW Devanayagam and MHM Naina Marikkar. Sri Lanka (SLFP) MPs? appointed to the committee were Sirimavo Bandaranaike and Maithripala Senanayake. Ceylon Workers Congress (CWC) Leader Saumiyamoorthy Thondaman who had not joined the government was also on the committee. The Tamil United Liberation Front (TULF) which at the time was the main opposition party refused to serve on the committee. In May 1978 the two SLFP representatives withdrew from the select committee. As a result of the left parties being wiped out in the 1977 poll, there were neither Trotskyites nor Communists in the committee. The executive presidency ushered in through the earlier second amendment was now streamlined and incorporated in the new draft constitution. The executive president was now head of state and head of government. The electoral system was also changed from the first- pass-the post system to that of? the proportional representative system. Sri Lanka became a Democratic Socialist Republic. The new Constitution referred to popularly as the ?JR constitution? was formally promulgated on September 7, 1978.
?
	Alfred Jeyaratnam Wilson
After the presidential system was installed, Prof. Alfred Jeyaratnam Wilson analysed it in his book ?The Gaullist system in Asia:The Constitution of Sri Lanka.? In it he observed, ?What Jayewardena was after was a stable executive which would not be easily swayed by pressures from within or outside. The outcome in the end was a President who in many ways can in certain circumstances, be more powerful than the French President.? Though he introduced a Presidential system, Mr. Jayewardene did not provide for a Cabinet appointed from outside Parliament. He was also averse to a powerful presidential secretariat as a parallel centre of power to the Cabinet.
In response to Prof. Wilson?s? specific query on that issue, JR replied, ?I must say I am very reluctant to appoint advisers who will be around the President. The reason is that I wish the President to have only his Prime Minister and the Cabinet of ministers as advisers because they represent the people as Members of Parliament?.
Mr. Jayewardene also outlined this position at the convocational address of the University of Sri Lanka on May 31, 1978. This is what he said at the time: ?I am the first elected Executive President, Head of State and Head of Government. It is an office of power and thus of responsibility. Since many others will succeed me I wish during my term of office to create precedents that are worthy of following. First, I will always act through the Cabinet and Parliament, preserving the parliamentary system as it existed without diminution of their powers.? Second, I will not create a group known as the President?s men and women who will influence him?. This then was JR Jayewardene?s definiton of the Presidency he had set up. This practice of following the British Cabinet model and confining such cabinet ministers to be members of Parliament has created an impression that the old system prevailed still in full force.
Notwithstanding Jayewardene?s claims to the contrary the reality was that governance had changed utterly in Sri Lanka after the executive presidency. The executive president was? both above as well as independent of the ?devalued? legislature. What is important to note is the fact that an executive president required full parliamentary strength to be all-powerful.When JR Jayewardene ushered in the presidency he controlled Parliament with a five-sixths majority. Thus the gigantic majority of the UNP in Parliament enabled JR to exercise power authoritatively akin to a dictator. Mr. Jayewardene? continued to? retain? this stranglehold on the legislature through several devices.
?
	Constitutional Dictator
JR? froze the UNP?s Parliamentary strength of five-sixths and further extended it?s term of office through the 1982 referendum; JR? prevented the crossing over of MP?s? from government to opposition by Constitutional legislation; JR? promoted crossing over from opposition to government through the infamous ?Rajadurai? Amendment to the Constitution. JR also got letters of resignation from all his MPs other than from S. Thondaman.? Thus? Sri Lanka?s first Executive President Junius Richard Jayewardene in practice became? a Constitutional ?dictator?.D.B.S.Jeyaraj can be reached at dbsjeyaraj@yahoo.com

Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe today urged that a stable Parliament be formed so that the people could be provided with long-term relief.
Addressing United National Party (UNP) May Day Rally at Cambell Park in Borella, the Prime Minister said it was essential to hold a general election and a stable Parliament be formed.?
He said the government had decided to increase the salaries of the private sector employees though a Parliamentary Bill.?
?We have given salary increments to public sector employees, provided a nutrition package for pregnant mothers, reduced the prices of essential goods and instituted political reforms through the 19th Amendment. These are the short term pledges made by our government and it is now time to fulfill the long term pledges as well,? he said. ?We need to have in place a stable Parliament where every member would be a part of the government.??
The Prime Minister asked a larger piece of cake in a future multi-party government mainly because it was the UNP which made the biggest sacrifice to elect President Maithripala Sirisena as President of Sri Lanka. (Yohan Perera)

President Maithripala Sirisena today pledged he would never leave room for the international community, any other country or group to raise issues regarding Sri Lanka?s fundamental rights, human rights, democracy or give them any excuse to interfere in the internal affairs of the country.
?I will fulfil all my pledges in restoring and safeguardingthe human rights and the fundamental rights of our people and lead the country on a victorious path while protecting its unitary character,? the President said the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) May Day rally which was the first public rally he addressed after being elected as party Chairman and Sri Lanka?s new President.
He said the rights of the working class will be safeguarded under his administration and said everyone should be responsible to protect Sri Lanka?s freedom, integrity and peace.
?We must work together regardless of political differences.

<U+200B>Religious freedom: US commends Sirisena?s govt
	
The United States Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF) today commended the President Maithripala Sirisena led government for taking steps to improve religious unity and religious freedom.
?Since President Sirisena took office in January, he has taken several steps to improve religious unity and religious freedom. For example, he created three new ministries to handle religious affairs for the Muslim, Christian, and Hindu communities respectively,? it said.?
?Additionally, the new Ministry of Christian Affairs appointed a special coordinator for Charismatic, Evangelical and Pentecostal Christian churches. The special police unit created by the former government has been disbanded, according to officials and religious communities with whom USCIRF met in March 2015.?
In its 2015 Annual Report released today, the USCIRF said, ??most importantly, reports of abuses against religious minorities have diminished in the first months of 2015, though concerns remain.?
This year's report documents religious freedom violations in 33 countries, makes country-specific recommendations, and assesses the U.S. government's implementation of the International Religious Freedom Act (IRFA).
The U.S. federal government advisory body recommended that Sri Lanka although does not meet Tier 1 (CPC) or Tier 2 thresholds, should still be a focus of concern.
A USCIRF delegation visited Sri Lanka in March 2015 to assess the climate for religious freedom, other human rights.
?President Sirisena's public statements on the need for national unity, reconciliation, harmony, and improved religious freedom have been encouraging, as were the comments by government officials with whom USCIRF met in March 2015.?
USCIRF recommended that the U.S. government should strongly encourage the positive movement that has occurred in recent months and encourage the Sri Lankan government to allow a transparent and independent investigation into alleged war crimes, including targeted attacks on religious minorities.
The Commission also recommended the U.S. government to ensure that a portion of U.S. humanitarian aid to Sri Lanka is used to help protect minorities from religiously-motivated violence.
It recommended assisting the Sri Lankan government to train local government officials, police officers, and judges on international religious freedom standards and on how to investigate and prosecute violent attacks.
The Commission urged the Sri Lankan government officials to provide minority students an equal opportunity to learn their faiths in public schools and to rescind policies and practices - often driven at local levels - that restrict religious communities' ability to build houses of worship or practice their faith.FULL REPORT
