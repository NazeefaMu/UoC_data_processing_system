As many possible Mihin Lanka employees will be absorbed to SriLankan
	
In regards to recently published reports in the media, the management of SriLankan Airlines and Mihin Lanka issued a statement today, reassuring staff members that as many Mihin Lanka staff as possible will be absorbed to SriLankan Airlines.
The full statement:
?It was decided to discontinue the services of Mihin Lanka, with effect from 30th October 2016. This decision has been made by the Government of Sri Lanka, as part of its long-term strategy to restructure the local aviation industry and strengthen the national carrier?s offering and efficiency.
Mihin Lanka had been making a net loss since its inception in 2007. Projections for the current financial year ending 31st March 2017 were also declared as a net loss.? All routes in Mihin Lanka?s route network will now be serviced by SriLankan Airlines thus marking a new beginning for the national carrier and building a strong, efficient and competitive airline that will be a force to be reckoned with in the region.
In regards to concerns about employment, the management of SriLankan Airlines has advised that due to the business operations of Mihin Lanka coming to an end on 31st December 2016, the airline envisaged that several staff members would be made redundant. Foreseeing this development ahead of time, the airline made elaborate plans for the redeployment of Mihin Lanka staff. So far recruitment processes have been completed for a total of 130 (out of a total of 304) employees of Mihin Lanka.
This recruitment and redeployment process is expected to continue until Mihin Lanka?s closure in December and all staff members who do not have the opportunity to join the national carrier, will be given a service severance package in alignment with specified government guidelines.
This media briefing came in the light of many open dialogues between the airline?s staff and management which took place at Mihin Lanka?s head office recently.? The meetings were held to discuss employee concerns regarding their employment, compensation and the airline?s amalgamation with the national carrier, which is currently underway. Mihin Lanka would like to reiterate that the meetings were conducted in a cordial and professional manner, without hostility and with the full cooperation of all parties involved.
The management team spent a great deal of time addressing each staff member?s concerns and explained that SriLankan Airlines had already incorporated several members of Mihin Lanka?s workforce cadre into its employee network. The management of the airline also reassured staff members that as many Mihin Lanka staff as possible will be absorbed. Accordingly details of the compensation package have been shared with all members of staff at Mhin Lanka.

Cigarette price to increase up to Rs. 55
	
The price of a cigarette is expected to be increased up to Rs.55 with the enactment of the 15 per cent VAT, according to the Minister of Health Rajitha Senaratne. Recently the price of a cigarette was increased by Rs.7.
At a meeting held at the ministry, he pointed out that although the cigarette price was increased up to Rs.42, the use of other related products (cigar) has not been increased. Use of these products also should be reduced but, the harm caused by cigarettes is higher than them.
Minister further added that there is no need to use cigars when the cigarette price is increased.
Minister also proposed to the government to increase the taxes on tobacco and thereby remove all the VAT taxes on health service.

Mervyn says authorities ?too quick? to act against cops in Jaffna shooting
	
Former Minister Mervyn Silva commenting on the deaths of the youths who died recently in Jaffna, after they were shot at by the police allegedly for disobeying orders to stop their motorcycle when ordered to do so, today said the authorities had acted too hastily to take action against the police personnel who were involved in the shooting.
While expressing shock and disbelief at the speed in which the authorities had reached their decision to take legal action taken against the police personnel involved in the incident, he said a proper inquiry should have been launched to ascertain what exactly took place before resorting to this action.
?I too stop my vehicle at road blocks when ordered by the police to do so and help them to fulfil their duties. The police personnel who were interdicted and remanded did not have hatred? enough to kill thee youths. They? only tried to fulfill their duties. The relevant authorities should not have acted so quickly to punish the police personnel, involved in the incident? he said.
He said even though many people are not aware of this, the Jaffna Police had done a praiseworthy job in eradicating social menaces in the district such as drugs, murders, rapes and robberies.

Three COPE reports on Bond issue
	
The possibility of presenting three reports by the Committee On Public Enterprises (COPE) has arisen as there are three groups of members which hold different opinions on the Bond issue, a member of the committee revealed today.
Member of COPE MP Bimal Ratnayake told a media briefing that one group directly holds former Central Bank Governor Arjun Mahendran responsible for the alleged scam regarding bonds while another group of members are of the opinion that there has been no scam at all while a third group of members is of the conclusion that there has been a scam but former Governor and others are not responsible for it.
?There may be even more than two reports considering the circumstances,? Mr Ratnayake said.
Responding to a question raised by the journalists as how could there be several reports of a committee in Parliament, the MP said there is provisions for such a situation according to the standing orders.
?There is no barrier for several reports but it would have been better if one report was presented,? he said.
?There were extensive discussions by the COPE members especially with regard to the Bond Scam on October 20 and 21 but as there were three opinions, the report which was prepared by the COPE Chief Sunil Handunetti and the Secretariat was approved by a majority of members will be presented to the House either on Tuesday (October 25, 2016) or Wednesday (October 26 2016),? he added.
Further, he recalled that the committee appointed by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe to probe the Bond Scam also called for an independent investigation as there was an unclear situation. (Yohan Perera)
