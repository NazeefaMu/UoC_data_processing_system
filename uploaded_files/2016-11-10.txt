Aussie company forced to pay thousands to underpaid Lankan
	
A Melbourne removalist company has been forced to pay $9,000 to a Sri Lankan asylum seeker it underpaid for work over three months, the Guardian reported on Thursday.
The Fair Work Ombudsman said the company, Shelly Removals and Storage Pty Ltd, had only paid the man for 38 to 40 hours a week when he regularly worked 50. It also paid him at a flat rate of $18 an hour, well below the award base rate of $23.75, up to $52.25 for overtime and public holidays.
It was the man?s first job since arriving in Australia, gained after answering an advertisement placed by the company on a notice board at an Australian Migrant English Service centre.
He was employed as a casual truck driver and removalist between October 2015 and January 2016 and was paid at the flat rate including on weekends and public holidays.
?Overseas workers are entitled to receive the same minimum rates and entitlements that apply to all workers in Australia ? and the rates are not negotiable,? ombudsman Natalie James said.
Shelly Removals and Storage also took unlawful deductions from his wages for ?insurance excess? after he was involved in an accident, and did not pay his meal allowances.
The ombudsman launched its investigation after the worker lodged a complaint and said the company?s director, Sima Vaknin, had fully cooperated.
The company backpaid the employee and agreed to enter an enforceable undertaking with the ombudsman to overhaul its working practises. It will face no legal action.
Vaknin told Guardian Australia the company was not aware it had been underpaying the man at the time. She said she didn?t know that the ombudsman?s ruling was made public and declined to comment further.
The man was on a bridging visa with work rights. As of July this year about 28,000 people are currently on bridging visas in Australia, with an unknown proportion allowed to find employment.
Community organisations have previously told the Guardian about two-thirds can work and there are widespread cases of exploitation by employers.
Kon Karapanagiotidis, the chief executive of the Asylum Seeker Resource Centre, said exploitation was common and a ?major ongoing issue?.

Fine for traffic offences up to Rs 2,500, case filing fee imposed
	
The minimum penalty on traffic offences will be increased to Rs. 2,500, the Finance Minister said presenting the Budget 2017 in Parliament.
He said most of the accidents are results of traffic violations and therefore proposed to revise the penalties.
The Finance minister added that a new ?filing? fee will be imposed when filing a Court case by any person in any Court.
In his budget speech, the minister said high volume of cases pending before the Courts is an overriding problem in the entire court system.
?Excessive caseloads cause delays in processing cases and deny the justice. And it causes a heavy burden to the government? he added.
To address the overload of cases in the Magistrate Courts, the minister proposed to amend the Motor Traffic Law to impose spot fine on offences.
?A system would be introduced for the errant motorists to pay their traffic fines through mobile phones,? the budget report said.
Meanwhile, an Annual License Fee of Rs 20,000 imposed on firearms. Firearms which are used for agricultural purposes are excluded from this fee.
Any person who uses firearms without obtaining or renewing such license will be charged of Rs. 5 million as a penalty.

Govt. having deals with 2012 Welikada prison massacre culprits?
	
The Committee for Protecting the Rights of Prisoners yesterday charged that all hopes that justice would be served with regards the ?massacre? of 27 prisoners at the Welikada Prison on November 10, 2012 under the good-governance motto of the government, had faded as the government was allegedly having secret deals with those who are responsible for the deaths of these prisoners.
Speaking at a media conference held in Maradana, the committee?s president, Attorney-at-Law Senaka Perera, said no individual has been arrested in connection with the prisoners? deaths despite investigations initiated by the CID, a Commission having been appointed by the former Minister of Rehabilitation and Prison Reforms Chandrasiri Gajadeera as well as an investigation by the Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka (HRCSL) into the the incident.
He said the government had failed to address this issue because it is engaged in a futile attempt to defend the main culprit who was having day-dreams of becoming the next leader of the country. The ?Yahapalana" government pledged to punish those who are behind the Welikada prison massacre only for political purposes. The fact that these murders had taken place in a well-planned and organized manner is not a secret anymore,? he said.
Civil Activist and Anti-Corruption Front (ACF) Convener Rajitha Keerthi Thennakoon, who also spoke, said that despite there were various investigations announced by the present and previous governments as well as the Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka, none of the reports had been published.
Sudesh Nandimal, a prisoner who witnessed the incident in 2012 but was not injured, alleged that they were informed by the Welikada Prison authorities that the order to shoot 27 prisoners was issued by the then Defence Secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa.
The committee said they would soon file a Writ Petition in the Colombo High Court to urge the Prisons Ministry to publish the investigation report which had already been completed and handed over to the government, which he said was not being done because the government was trying to protect the culprits.

Govt. plans to reduce deficit to 4.7%: Ravi
	
Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake said the government targets a fiscal deficit of 3.5 percent of GDP by 2020, while it has planned to reduce the deficit to 4.7 percent next year from a targeted 5.4 percent in 2016.
The economy inherited was not an easy one for any Finance Minister to manage due to public debts in excess of Rs.9.9 trillion plus Rs.1.2 trillion in debts off the balance sheet. However, with strict financial discipline, the government has been able to pay attention to financial consolidation and reducing the budget deficit, he said.
Mr. Karunanayake will present the third budget of the National Unity Government of President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe this afternoon in Parliament. This will be the 70th Budget of independent Sri Lanka.
?GDP had increased to Rs.11,183 billion (US$ 82.3 B.) in 2015, from Rs.6,414 billion (US$ 56.7B.) in 2010. Sri Lanka has a new phenomenon in its expenditure chain, in that a sizeable proportion goes for social welfare and subsidies. Next year?s budget will allocate around Rs 380 billion to welfare and subsidies,? he said.
Mr. Karunmanayake said Budget 2017 would be a pro-growth budget and focus on countering the deficiencies of the past several years. Accordingly, the budget would have proposals to rectify all existing anomalies -- to deal with the export sector to create jobs.
?It will cover all sectors of the economy and will be beneficial to the people in the short term as well as the long term,? he said, outlining his budget.
Once the Budget is presented in the Parliament on Thursday the debate on the second reading and the committee stage will continue till December 10. (Sandun A Jayasekera)

Hillary Clinton delivers painful concession speech
	
"I'm sorry."With those simple words, Hillary Clinton, who thought she would wake up Wednesday as the first woman president-elect but crashed to a stunning election defeat to Donald Trump, ended her White House quest and likely her political career.
The Democratic nominee unequivocally conceded the presidential race, and said that the Constitution requires a peaceful transfer of power.
"Last night, I congratulated Donald Trump and offered to work with him on behalf of our country. I hope that he will be a successful president for all Americans," Clinton said.
"Donald Trump is going to be our president. We owe him an open mind and a chance to lead," said Clinton, who was composed and dignified even as she admitted how painful her defeat was in her first public comments on the result of the election.
"This is not the outcome that we wanted and we worked so hard for, and I am sorry that we did not win this election," Clinton told supporters and campaign workers in New York.
Clinton also addressed the historic achievement for which she twice strived in losing presidential campaigns.
"I know we have still not shattered that highest and hardest glass ceiling, but someday, someone will, and hopefully sooner than we might think right now."
She then directed her remarks to women.
"To all the women and especially the young women who put their faith in this campaign and in me, I want you to know that nothing has made me prouder than to be your champion," Clinton said, her voice breaking with emotion.
"And to all the little girls who are watching this, never doubt that you are valuable and powerful and deserving of every chance and opportunity in the world to pursue and to achieve your own dreams."
Clinton speech was devoid of bitterness and seemed at times to be an attempt to inspire her supporters about the virtues of public service and of fighting for what they believe.
But she also put Trump on notice that the core American values, which many Democrats believe Trump abhors with his proposals for a ban on Muslim immigration and rhetorical assaults on female journalists during his campaign.
"Our constitutional democracy enshrines the peaceful transfer of power and we don't just respect that, we cherish it. It also enshrines other things: the rule of law, the principle that we are equal in rights and dignity, freedom of worship and expression. We respect and cherish these values too and we must defend them." (CNN)

SL aware of Lankans joining foreign terrorist organizations: IGP
	
Though the country was now free of conventional terrorism, the Sri Lankan Government was very much aware of the threat of its citizens joining foreign terrorist organizations, Inspector General of Police Pujith Jayasundara said addressing the INTERPOL General Assembly in Bali, Indonesia yesterday.
The IGP said that involvement of Sri Lankans in foreign terrorist organizations was recently revealed following the killing of a Sri Lankan in Syria in 2015.
He said that Sri Lanka had suffered immensely from terrorism for well over three decades.
?It is with great pride that I mention that we have successfully rooted out terrorism in 2009. Now, Sri Lanka is going through post-conflict phase and is focused on reconciliation, rehabilitation and development of the conflict affected areas,? he said.
IGP Jayasundara said that all communities should have a clear and common definition for terrorism.
?With decades of experience we in the Sri Lanka law enforcement know that combating terrorism is not an easy task,? he added.
The IGP said that, in order to combat international terrorism, law enforcement agencies needed to work under different jurisdictions.
?This has to be addressed, so that cross-border cooperation of security agencies is facilitated,? he said. (Darshana Sanjeewa)

Thousands across the USA protest Trump victory
	
NEW YORK - Protesters took to the streets Wednesday in at least 10 cities to march against president-elect Donald Trump - and numerous college students and faculty leaders took to social media to announce support groups and even postponed exams.
Protests were underway in Chicago, New York, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Boston, Washington, D.C., Portland, Ore., St. Paul, Minn. and several other cities. An estimated 2,000 protesters shouted angrily in downtown Seattle, expressing their frustration at the Trump victory over Democrat and former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, who won 228 electoral votes to Trump's 279.
Police in riot gear struggled to hold back scores of protesters in some of the cities as protesters chanted "Not My President" and "No Racist USA." The protests were mostly peaceful. Seattle police said they were investigating a report of a shooting near the site of the protest in that city, but it may not have involved protesters.
In Washington, D.C., hundreds took to the streets carrying signs saying ?Nasty Women Fight Back? and ?White Males for Equality for All.?
The unrest culminated when two separate anti-Trump demonstrations converged in front of the Trump International Hotel. They chanted and yelled "Impeach Donald Trump? and toward the end yelled at police officers who stood guard at the hotel entrance.

War Veterans' Department will be established: Ruwan
	
State Defence Minister Ruwan Wijewardene said a War Veterans' Department would be established next year to prevent a repitition of incidents such as that which occurred in front of the Presidential Secretariat on Wednesday, when a group of disabled soldiers clashed with the police.
Mr. Wijewardene told reporters that a War Veterans' Department would be set up that is similar to the War Veterans' Department of the US. He said it would be responsible for all welfare work concerning war veterans of the Sri Lanka Army, Sri Lanka Air Force, Sri Lanka Navy and Sri Lanka Police -- such as the payment of pensions, allowances, health benefits and other benefits.
"The necessary legal framework for the department is being drafted right now," he said.
Mr. Wijewardene while expressing the government's regret at the unfortunate incident where the police were compelled to turn water cannon on the disabled war veterans to stop them from forcibly entering the Presidential Secretariat, said the protest had been an attempt to put the government in an embarrassing position, despite the fact that the two parties had already arrived at a compromise, and representatives of the disabled soldiers had requested the protesting disabled soldiers to stop the protest and disperse peacefully.
The government was extremely sorry about what happened, he said. He added that the Joint Opposition was behind the clash which led to two disabled soldiers being wounded. He said some JO parliamentarians and a number of Bhikkus had incited a group brought in from outside to create the disturbances and try to enter the Presidential Secretariat -- forcing the police to use the minimum possible force to stop them.
