Amazing Grace to raise funds for the differently abled
	
Prestantia Music School Junior Concert Choir

Amazing Grace- An Easter Choral Reflection will be presented by the Prestantia Chorale on March 25, (Palm Sunday) at 6.30pm at The Methodist Church Wellawatta, 1st Chapel Lane, Galle Road, Colombo 6. As in the past, this event will be free and open to anyone interested in music. The chorale intends to raise funds for the Ceylon Schools for the Deaf & Blind in Ratmalana (CSDB) through Free will donations.
The Prestantia Chorale will present an Easter choral programme for the fifth consecutive year and promises an evening of reflective, spirit-filled choral music to celebrate the season. The choir will play a prominent role towards communicating a variety of emotions through songs ranging from Classical to Contemporary Repertoire. It must be emphasized that the Prestantia Music School, a leading Performing Arts School, outside the Colombo city was successful at its very first attempt at a choral competition! According to Dr. Priyeshni Perera, one of the core objectives besides coaching for this initiative was for her teams to exercise soft skills such as teamwork, leadership, discipline, punctuality, tolerance and social responsibility which are becoming increasingly challenging to observe in a competitive millennial society. 
Why raise funds for the CSDB  Its the largest and the oldest school in the country set up in 1912 for special needs children and provides meals and accommodation for free besides the special needs education to 700+ students. With the rising cost of food and other costs, a donation of any kind goes a long way towards meeting their basic needs, explained Desmond Perera, the principal of the school. The Deaf & Blind School is governed by the Board of Trustees and the Diocese of Colombo (Anglican Church) which strives to raise funds through well-wishers and donors.
In raising funds for this worthy cause Prestantia Junior Open Choir of the Prestantia Music School will join-in with the Chorale this year too. The instrumental ensemble will consist of (Dr.) Priyeshni P. Perera (Piano), Christopher Prins (Percussion), Saranga Cooray (Cello) , Sachiththa Fernando (Violin), Nimalka Marian (Keyboard Synthesizer), and Sound Engineering Support by Janaka Fernando of Xtreme Entertainment and Madhawa Perera of Ad Lib Pictures.

Disciplinary action not an issue for those voting in favour of no faith motion: Susil
	
Disciplinary action would not be an issue for those who sign the no confidence motion against Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, UPFA Parliamentarian, Minister of Science, Technology and Research A. D. Susil Premajayantha said yesterday.
The Minister said the main allegations of the no confidence motion depended on the Bond scam and the current situation would not have occurred if it was resolved in the first place.
He said there were two major parties and several small parties in the unity government which have their own party principles, however sometimes confrontations can occur.
We always try to come to a common understanding. When we fail, disagreements like this can occur, he added. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

## Title: Dr. Zurfick 184th President of YMCA Forum
## Section: News Features

Dr. Zurfick 184th President of YMCA Forum
	
Veteran sportsman Dr. M.G.M.S. Zurfick was elected as the184th President of the YMCA Forum, Colombo at its annual general meeting held on March 9. Witty, cheerful and large-hearted at age 76 Dr. Zurfick is the epitome of life. His halcyon days do bind strongly as an athlete at the Colombo YMCA where he cut his teeth in wrestling and judo. He crowned himself as national champion in wrestling, judo and motor racing. He emerged as champ at the All India Motor Racing Championship for four years in the late 1960s. 
Zurfick nostalgically recalls that keeping the lion flag flying gave him great pride. His benign demeanor has won him many great friends across the globe and cherishes standing shoulder to shoulder with the legendary boxing great Muhammad Ali. His name has been synonymous with Sri Lankan sports for over half a century. 

Zurfick nostalgically recalls that keeping the lion flag flying gave him great pride. His benign demeanor has won him many great friends across the globe and cherishes standing shoulder to shoulder with the legendary boxing great Muhammad Ali

His favourite machine was the Yamaha, and it was astride a Yamaha that Zurfick blazed a golden trail that endeared him to the Japanese in a big way. For, it was Zurfick who won the trust and the hearts of the world famous Yamaha manufacturers by flying to championship honours time and again on a Yamaha product. It influenced the Yamaha people to ship a special Yamaha make to Zurfick after he approached them after reading a magazine about the Yamaha Company. But M.G.M.S. Zurfick was more than a champion. He transcended his sports career to a point of winning the world by his yearning to see the world and win over people by his very simple and friendly trait. This knack was to take Zurfick from country to country and face to face with world greats; not only in the sporting arena, but heads of state as well. He has also met up with the famous South African leader Nelson Mandela. 
As Zurfick now recalls, his sports career was to propel him from the medal glitter to the glitter of gems and jewellery as a leading Sri Lankan businessman. He had the rare distinction of taking two of the treasures of Sri Lanka namely the Star of Lanka Blue Star Sapphire over 400 carats and the Cats Eye to Japan which opened the gateway for Japanese gem dealers to Sri Lanka. These same two treasures were also exhibited at the Royal wedding of Prince Charles and Princess Diana in London. 
What is amazing about the man is that he is still young at heart competing in the veterans athletic events including the Nuwara-Eliya road races. Now over half a century from his heyday, Zurfick has not lost the medal ego. He brought home two runners-up medals from the javelin and the discus last year. In the put shot he had a very bad fall that affected his lower back that he had fractured in the good old days while doing motor racing track. 
Founded in 1882 with membership status, the National Council of the YMCAs of Sri Lanka is the apex body of 38 local YMCAs spread across the country. It became a full member of the World Alliance of YMCAs in 1962. The vision of the YMCA is to commit its membership to fulfill Gods mission to establish just and human society. The vision and mission are put into practice with a set of specific, measurable activities (goals) designed by several sub committees, the Ex-Co.
A research report prepared on this subject by the Chairman was published in local languages. In addition a handbook to prepare the prospective migrant workers was published. Attempts are made to create awareness on environmental Conservation. Four YMCAs have established migrant centres and provide required information and Financial Support.

ETI, Swarna Mahal Finance; CB, Treasury acting as mediators: Kiriella
	
House Leader Lakshman Kiriella yesterday told Parliament the Government would ensure that ETI Finance and Swarna Mahal Financial Services refunded the funds deposited by more than 35,000 customers, despite the financial crisis within the two institutions.
He said the two companies could pay back their depositors from the sale proceeds of the company's assets.
The minister was responding to a question asked by JVP Leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake with regard to the plight of the depositors of these two failed institutions.
He said the Central Bank had taken several steps to protect the companies, such as limiting the withdrawal of deposits at maturity and extending the deposit period by six months, and added that the CB was closely monitoring the activities of the companies.
Responding to the question about the legal provisions involved in selling the EAP Group of Companies which owned radio stations and a TV station to an overseas Company, he said the government would act within the legal framework and in accordance with the Constitution.
He said the Central Bank and the Treasury were functioning as the mediator in the matter. (Ajith Siriwardana and Yohan Perera)

EU backs Britain in blaming Russia
	

REUTERS, 23rd MARCH, 2018- European Union leaders backed Britain on Thursday in blaming Moscow over a nerve agent attack on a former Russian spy in England and recalled their envoy to Moscow in a symbolic protest.
The show of support from the EU, at a time when Britain is grappling with its departure from the bloc, will boost Prime Minister Theresa May, who has been asking other nations to match her decision to expel Russians over the attack.
In a joint summit statement, the leaders said the EU agrees with the United Kingdom governments assessment that it is highly likely that the Russian Federation is responsible and that there is no plausible alternative explanation.
That marked a breakthrough for Britain, which had been seeking to persuade EU leaders to condemn Russia for the attempted murder of Sergei Skripal, a former Russian double agent, and his daughter on March 4. It was the first known offensive use of a nerve toxin in Europe since World War Two.
After talks that ran into the early hours of Friday, German Chancellor Angela Merkel raised the prospect of further punitive measures in response to the attack in the southwestern city of Salisbury, saying the European Union would strive to act together on the matter.
We are determined to react together, with the language we used here, but also possibly through additional measures, Merkel said at the end of the first day of the summit.

Ex-Playboy model details alleged affair with Trump
	

DPA, 23rd MARCH, 2018- Former Playboy model Karen McDougal gave an interview on Thursday describing a 10-month affair she says she had with US President Donald Trump a decade ago, and apologized to his wife Melania.
What can you say except Im sorry she told CNN, which broadcast the interview late Thursday. Im sorry. I wouldnt want it done to me.
Her first televised comments about the 2006-07 affair came days after she filed a lawsuit against American Media Inc, which owns the National Enquirer tabloid, in a bid to void an agreement on the rights to her story, which she sold before the 2016 election.
Trump has denied the affair, as well as another alleged dalliance with porn star Stephanie Clifford, known as Stormy Daniels, who is also seeking to void a non-disclosure agreement she signed before the election.
McDougal said she wasnt out to make money out of the affair, which began when she met Trump at a party at the Playboy Mansion in Los Angeles the year after he married Melania.
Im out to get my rights back, to prove a contract was illegal, that I was taken advantage of and go back to my life. Period, she said.

House approves motion to increase judges' salaries
	
A motion to increase the salaries of the Chief Justice and Supreme Court and Appeal Court judges was unanimously passed in Parliament without a debate.
House Leader Lakshman Kiriella inquired into the possibility of approving the motion and joint opposition MP Bandula Gunawardane said his group was agreeable. No objections were raised from the other opposition groups as well.
The motion states that the pensionable allowance of the mentioned judicial officers would be increased by up to 50 per cent of their salary with effect from January 1, 2018 while a monthly professional allowance of Rs.150,000 considered for pension purposes would replace the special non pensionable monthly allowance of Rs.15,000 paid earlier.
Although the usual procedure followed in Sri Lanka is that the MP's salaries are automatically increased when salaries of judicial officers are increased, it would have to be done through a separate motion, apparently expected to be brought in with regard to the MP's.

## Title: India will look at things differently now; MR

India will look at things differently now; MR
	
Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa in an interview with the Indian Express said that even though the present Indian government may have had reservations about his government in 2014, he believes they (India) will look at things differently now.
Three years after he was swept out of office, Mahinda Rajapaksa, Sri Lankas former President, thinks he is in with a chance to return to power. Last month, the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP), the party loyal to him, made a stunning comeback with a massive win in local body polls. And early this month, Rajapaksas rival and successor President Maithripala Sirisena had to declare a state of emergency for more than a week after Buddhist-Muslim clashes left the island-nation reeling.
Although elections are not due in Sri Lanka until 2020, these developments have prompted Rajapaksa to press for early elections. In an interview to The Indian Express, Rajapaksa spoke on the possibility of his return to power, his role in the next presidential polls, the economic crisis in Sri Lanka and the Chinese debt trap.
Excerpts from the interview:
You had a massive victory in the local body polls. What does this mean for the party loyal to you
It is quite clear that people of Sri Lanka want to see us return to power. They want to see an end to the chaos that has reigned in this country since January 2015.
Have you started talks with potential allies Are new political equations emerging How do you hope to reassure your critics such as civil society and human rights groups
We have been approached by some ministers and MPs from the ruling coalition. Some crossovers may take place in future. You referred to civil society groups and human rights groups. In Sri Lanka, most of these so-called civil society groups are not real civil society groups but NGOs funded by Western nations. Such groups support only those who promote the agenda of their paymasters. In India, I believe things are very different.
It has been nearly a decade since the war ended. Has peace returned
After the war was brought to an end, we concentrated on rebuilding affected areas with roads, schools, hospitals, irrigation works etc, restored civil administration and re-established democratic institutions. Our aim was, and will be, to have a united Sri Lanka where members of all communities have equal rights and equal opportunities and are assured personal safety.
What is left for the countrys Tamils What is the status of rehabilitation and the reconciliation effort
Sri Lanka is a textbook case of how a problem arose in the 1950s due to a series of misunderstandings and deliberate misrepresentations in a situation where there had been no problem earlier. This was started by opportunistic politicians who saw communal politics as an effortless way to win and retain popular support. In time, this escalated into a war that shook not just Sri Lanka but also India and the whole world. Unfortunately, even after the war, certain foreign powers and interest groups operating from overseas have not allowed things to stabilise in this country. Today, the biggest obstacle to reconciliation between the various communities living in this country is interference by overseas-based interest groups and various foreign powers.
How do you look at the recent communal tensions in Kandy
In my view, the disturbances in Kandy were a natural outgrowth of a project that was started in 2012 to defeat my government. People were taken overseas by foreign governments, and some were granted multiple re-entry visas to powerful countries. Various organisations sprang up overnight and unknown people suddenly became public figures. This tension between the Sinhala and Muslim people was deliberately created 2012 onward. The mistake that we made was that we tried to do damage-control instead of dealing with it head-on. Muslims voted en masse against my government, thinking that we were behind these organisations. But by now, most Muslims in this country have realised that the people responsible for all these incidents, in 2012 through 2014 to this day, are all in the present government, and not with us. What is necessary here is for the Muslims to observe the manner in which they were manipulated and used for a political project in January 2015. The incidents that we saw taking place last year and this year is due to an attempt by the same parties to use the Muslim community to further their political agenda yet again.
You were in Delhi when Narendra Modi became Prime Minister. How do you look at India given that elections are due next year
When Prime Minister Modi was in Sri Lanka last year, I met him at the Indian High Commissioners residence in Colombo. The year 2019 will be an election year in India as well as in Sri Lanka. We got on well with the Congress government and I believe Shivshankar Menon, Indias former Foreign Secretary and National Security Advisor, made appreciative comments in his memoirs about the relationship that existed between our countries at that time. Prime Minister Modi was elected to power in 2014 and we did not have enough time to get to know each other better before I was voted out. Our aim will be to have cordial relations with both Congress as well as BJP-led governments.
What is your reaction to observations on Sri Lanka moving closer to China, Chinese interests in the Indian Ocean region and the huge investments being made in Sri Lanka, Maldives and Pakistan
There was no question of betraying India. Sri Lanka has had close relations with the Peoples Republic of China since it was founded. The relationship that my government had with China was purely economic. Some of the key projects that China did like the Hambantota Port was first offered to India but was declined and it was then handed over to China. When my government was in power, there was never any move to lease the entire Hambantota free port along with its precinct of 5000 acres to a private company. My government had made plans to lease only the container terminal the same way the terminals in the Colombo harbour have been leased to private companies. But the free port and its 5000 acres would have remained under the Sri Lanka Ports Authority. I must say that China also never asked us to lease the free port to them. This idea of leasing the entire Hambantota free port to a private party came up only after the change of government in January 2015.
How do you look at relations between Sri Lanka and China, and Indias complicated relations with Pakistan and China
Sri Lanka has always had close relations with India, China and Pakistan and these friendships will continue in the future as well. Pakistan is a valued friend which has helped us at crucial moments during the war and on the diplomatic front. Likewise China is a valued friend with whom we have had many economic dealings. It has helped us on the economic front. Even though the present government of India may have had reservations about my government in 2014, I believe they will look at things differently now.
Since the 19th amendment of the Sri Lankan Constitution doesnt allow you to contest in the presidential poll for the third time, where do you place yourself in the next presidential poll
My role in the next presidential election will be the same as the role I played in the recent local government election. I will lead the campaign on behalf of the candidate chosen by the joint Opposition and the SLPP.
You have issued statements on a failing economic situation. Is Sri Lanka facing an economic crisis
What I was trying to show was that even though there was this talk of huge debts incurred by my government for infrastructure projects, the loans taken for those projects was actually quite small when compared with the foreign currency borrowings of the present government. Sri Lanka was never in any kind of Chinese debt trap during my tenure in office even though some sections of the Western media portrayed it as such. Todays debt crisis has been brought about by the present government.
After the recent riots, you said a coalition comprising Sinhalese, Tamils and Muslim leaders like the post-independence government should be ideal for Sri Lanka. What is your message to minorities in the country
My message to the Tamil people of Sri Lanka is that they should not be influenced by the propaganda of overseas-based organisations and various other interested parties. The Tamil people of Sri Lanka should realise that there are Tamil communities living in India, Malaysia, Singapore, South Africa and many other countries and they all lead normal lives. However, in Sri Lanka we see that the Tamil people are being deliberately denied a normal life by forces that want to use them to carve out an independent Tamil state. Even after the war ended, this attempt has not ceased because foreign parties are keeping alive the hope of incremental progression towards a separate state.
Where do you place your two brothers in your political and personal life
Ours has always been a very united family. Gotabaya and Basil came from overseas to help me in my presidential election campaign in 2005 and on my request, they both stayed back to help me administer the country. I did not get them involved in my government simply because they were my brothers, but because they had abilities that the country could use. I think they both proved themselves in the tasks they undertook. But both have made their mark. After I lost power in January 2015, both have faced persecution by this government. We have never had any falling out among ourselves.

MPs voting for no-faith motion of PM should step down from govt.: Minister
	
Buddhasasana Minister Gamini Jayawickrama Perera said parliamentarians who will vote against Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe in the no-confidence motion should immediately step down from their governmental portfolios.
Addressing an event held in Kurunegala on Thursday, Minister Perera said the no-confidence motion against Prime Minister Wickremesinghe which was brought by the joint opposition could be considered as blessing in disguise.
Even though a unity government was established, the government had faced several issues when arriving at certain decisions in an accurate manner even in the Cabinet due to the acts of some members who were standing on both sides, he said.
He said such actions had negatively affected the development process of the country and added that the people who were concealing could reveal themselves during the voting of the no-confidence motion against Prime Minister Wickremesinghe.
Accordingly, all the parliamentarians who are voting against Prime Minister Wickremesinghe should step down from their governmental portfolios, he said.
He said the remaining eighteen-month period of the government was adequate to implement the development plans of the government by engaging in a strict policy with the combined effort of the parties like Jathika Hela Urumaya, Sri Lanka Muslim Congress and All Ceylon Makkal Congress.

New system to submit docs relating to Lankans deceased abroad
	
Ministry of Foreign Affairs, in coordination with the Ministry of Home Affairs, has introduced a new system through which relatives of Sri Lankans deceased abroad are allowed to submit identity documents, affidavits, and other documentation relating to the repatriation of human remains or conduct of last rites, through Divisional Secretariats islandwide.
Issuing a statement the ministry said that the relatives of the deceased person were required to submit such documents to the Consular Affairs Division to bring human remains to Sri Lanka, or to get authorisation to conduct last rites abroad. Under the new system, the relatives of the deceased could submit the required documentation to the nearest Divisional Secretariat, which in turn would forward them to the Consular Affairs Division for appropriate action.
It said that Secretary to the Ministry of Home Affairs has already issued a circular, instructing all Divisional Secretaries to extend required assistance for the effective implementation of this initiative.
The new system allows relatives of deceased to have their required documentation processed at the nearest Divisional Secretariat, without having the need to travel to the Consular Affairs Division in Colombo or the Regional Consular Office in Jaffna. The general public in outstation areas would particularly benefit from the new arrangement and avoid the need for travelling long distances to Colombo or Jaffna at a time of bereavement as well as undue delays and expenditure, the statement said.

This initiative is part of the endeavours of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to streamline, decentralize and improve Consular service delivery to the public, it added.

Rajanganaya Reservoir drinking water project still in progress: MONLAR
	
The Movement for Land and Agriculture Reform (MONLAR) yesterday claimed that the constructions of the proposed drinking water supply project based on the Rajanganaya Reservoir was still in progress despite statements made by the authorities that it had been suspended.
MONLAR member environmentalist Sajeewa Chamikara told the Daily Mirror that claims on the suspension of the said project was completely inaccurate and added that no such order had been made declaring the suspension of its ongoing constructions.
Following the tense situation that occurred in Thabuththegama last month when farmers expressed their displeasure on this project, even a government minister had claimed that this project would not be continuing at the same place and it will be taken to Neelabamma area. However, the constructions are still in progress, he added.
He said it was not very simple to move this project to some other area or to suspend it since agreements had been made and cabinet papers had been approved with regard to it. He also said accordingly the possibilities were less for them to belive on the suspension of this project.
He said no agreement had been reportedly made so far on moving this project to another place or on its suspension. He also said the continuation of this project would risk the livelihoods of the thousands of farmers and the lives of thousands of people who were living there.
As per the claims of these authorities, they are using water from the Rajanganaya Reservoir for the Thambuttegama water supply scheme due to the heavy demand for drinking water and the prevalence of kidney patients in the area, he said.
He said however if the water in this reservoir would be used for the consumption of kidney patients it would risk their lives since the water in this tank were mixed with chemicals including agro-chemicals; The authorities should take immediate measures to avoid this mishap, he added.
Meanwhile, Anuradhapura District Secretary, Government Agent R.M.Wanninayaka said the suspension was still valid and added that no construction with regard to the said project had reported during this period.
However, the final decision on this project has not been made yet, he added. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)

He said the Central Bank officials were to be blamed for the interest rate hikes. Can a person run a business by borrowing at 16 per cent," he asked.

Sri Lanka will become another Uganda if Central Bank officials run the country," he said.
Mr Karunanayake said the main issue was that central bank officials remained though governments changed. (Yohan Perera and Ajith Siriwadana)

Stepping up on efforts to conquer TB
	

World TB (Tuberculosis) Day held annually on March 24th is intended to promote awareness and knowledge of the seriousness of the disease and to motivate action to be taken in order to cure TB worldwide 
135 years after the discovery of the kochs bacillus, TB still remains an epidemic in much of the world today despite the effective cures which have been made available for decades. This lethal killer of human beings still prevails despite many scientific breakthroughs. 
Tuberculosis has re-emerged with a vengeance and has become the deadliest infectious disease in the world and has become the number one killer causing three (3) million deaths per year. These deaths also create serious implications on the world economy, as it kills or disables mainly young people who form the productive sector of the economy. The World Health Organization (WHO) declared Tuberculosis a global emergency in 1993. This illness could affect around 90 million people worldwide within the next decade. 

The emergence of multi drug resistant tuberculosis can be controlled if the treatment of tuberculosis patients is completely supervised. Tuberculosis patients (or for that matter any patient) have the bad habit of forgetting to take their drugs when, they feel better, or throwing their drugs away when they feel better

A study was undertaken in collaboration with the medical personnel of the Respiratory Disease Control Programme of the Ministry of Health, the Centre for Social Survey and the University of Sri Jayewardenepura

Tuberculosis appears in forms resistant to multiple drugs (MDR TB) and cannot be cured by a single medicine. Together with its deadly ally, the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), TB has emerged as one of the most potent threats to the existence of mankind. 
Can tuberculosis be eliminated Low priority has been assigned to tuberculosis by health policy makers. In many low to middle income countries, less than 1% of the annual health budget is allocated for tuberculosis prevention. Why is this Is it because Tuberculosis is something to be swept under the carpet 
The inadequate funding and inefficient tuberculosis control programmes have led to a worsening of the global situation regarding tuberculosis.
This is because of inadequate treatment that does not cure patients nor cause fatalities, leaving a pool of inadequately or improperly treated patients disseminating multi - drug resistant tuberculosis in the community. In other words, in a poor tuberculosis control programme, many patients will die of the disease, but there will also be half treated half dead patients disseminating the disease to healthy people. Also, if there were no tuberculosis drugs at all in a country, there would be no multi - drug resistant tuberculosis for it is the improper use of anti - tuberculosis drugs that creates multi-drug resistant tuberculosis.
This is also compounded by patients who are forced to purchase drugs as cases have emerged of patients seeking private treatment having to purchase the drugs cutting costs by self reduction of the dosage or discontinuing the treatment due to lack of funds while in other instances cheaper drugs with less efficacy also causing great harm. 
However, all is not that gloomy. It has been shown conclusively in countries poorer than Sri Lanka, such as Nepal and Bangladesh. (with per GNP of around US$200, compared to a per capita GNP of US$ 840 for Sri Lanka).
More than 90% of Tuberculosis patients can be cured. The emergence of multi drug resistant tuberculosis can be controlled if the treatment of tuberculosis patients is completely supervised.
Tuberculosis patients (or for that matter any patient) have the bad habit of forgetting to take their drugs when, they feel better, or throwing their drugs away when they feel better.
As Tuberculosis has been declared a global emergency many efforts are being made to find new effective solutions and strategies in service, design and delivery to eliminate this global menace which is appearing in various forms. 
New tools, drugs and strategies are being researched and tried out bringing effective results.Lets take a closer look at them.
The DOTS Strategy (Directly Observed Treatment Short cause)
Represents a major breakthrough in controlling tuberculosis. No other TB control strategy comes close to being as effective and is affordable as DOTS. 
The advantages to the community by using the DOTS strategy are numerous. 

A. Cures the patients
Dots produces cure rates as high as 95 percent, even in the poorest of countries.

B. Prevents New Infections
DOTS makes it virtually impossible to cause a patient to develop incurable forms of TB that are becoming more common.

MDRTB
DOTS Makes it virtually impossible to cause a patient to develop the incurable forms of TB that are becoming more common.

Cost effective
A six-month supply of medicines for DOTS cost only $ 11 per patient in some parts of the world. This can be less than the price of a few bottles of aspirin. The World Bank has ranked the DOTS strategy as one of the most cost effective of all health interventions. 

Community based
DOTS have been demonstrated to add as many years of life as currently available protease inhibitors to HIV positive people.

Protects the workforce
Nearly 80 percents of those ill with TB are in their most economically productive years of life. These youthful TB patients represent a workforce nearly as large as the number of people employed by the worlds 20 biggest international corporations.


Protects International Travelers
The only safeguard against TB is to use DOTS more widely.

Stimulates Economies
The DOTS strategy offers relatively quick payoffs to the economies of developing countries.

Proven effective
DOTS has been successfully implemented in a wide variety of conditions, including Sri Lanka, India, Tanzania, Guinea, China, 
1. The implementation of the Stop TB Strategy
This strategy has greatly expanded the Tuberculosis diagnosis and treatment services and has saved millions of lives. 
The development of new tools is a major component of the revised global efforts to stop TB Progress made in this area. They are now in the evaluation process and will be incorporated in to the TB control programme in the near future.
Systematic Strategy for screening and monitoring high risk zones
Where the population is concentrated such as, 
a) Garment Industries 
b) Factories 
c) Prison Institutions 
d) Rehabilitation Camps 
e) Elderly Peoples Institutions 
f) Orphanages 
g) Mental Asylums 
h) Low income communities residing in congested areas. 

04. Changing of the campaign terminology strategy
In the campaign such terms as TB suspects, defaulters, control, Campaign tend to criminalize and use terminology that is patient unfriendly, Therefore in the control of Tuberculosis consideration is being given to the use of terms which are more humane and patient friendly which will make the patient more co-operative. 

05Greater involvement of NGOS/ CNAPT
In recruiting and mobilizing volunteers for treatment and supervision which will make Tuberculosis programmes efficient. 
Compared to other South Asian Countries, Sri Lanka is far ahead in terms of quality of life, life expectancy, literacy and maternal mortality. This is a constant source of amazement to developed countries, who wonder how we can maintain such indices comparable to developed countries.
 
Ceylon National Association for the Prevention of Tuberculosis (CNAPT) Initiatives in Sri Lanka
It has been recorded that in countries poorer than Sri Lanka, such as Nepal and Bangladesh, (with per capita GNP of around $ 200, compared to a per capita GNP of US $840 for Sri Lanka) have managed more than 90% of controlled Tuberculosis treatment. 
However, compared to other South Asian countries, Sri Lanka is far ahead in terms of life expectancy, literacy, and maternal and infant mortality. This is a consistent source of amazement to developed countries like Japan. It would be tragic if the TB situation in Sri Lanka was allowed to deteriorate, in spite of possessing such a record of healthcare. 
This is where the CNAPT steps in educating the public in one of the areas most important in TB eradication. The CNAPT has been at the forefront of the campaign for the education of Sri Lankans. Over the past 70 years, the CNAPT has worked in partnership with the Ministry of Health. 
In 1948 when tuberculosis (TB) was prevalent in Sri Lanka, the Ceylon National Association for the Prevention of Tuberculosis (CNAPT) was formed as a Government approved non government organization (NGO), aimed at launching a nationwide TB programme which had support and international cooperation. 70 years ago when medical treatment was at its infancy and TB was rampant with no definitive cure, Dr. J.H.F.Jayasuriya, Chairman of the Rotary Club, Colombo, sponsored a voluntary organization to combat TB through the auspices of the club. An inaugural meeting was held on 17th June 1948, thus heralding the beginning of the CNAPT. 
A study was undertaken in collaboration with the medical personnel of the Respiratory Disease Control Programme of the Ministry of Health, the Centre for Social Survey and the University of Sri Jayewardenepura. 
With the intention of spreading knowledge regarding TB, its spread, prevention and management as well as to inform the public on how and where to get the help and information required, the CNAPT, with the assistance of the Global Fund, also started a Health Education Programme.
The international community, WHO NGOs and the Sri Lankan Government have done a great deal for the prevention, treatment and management of the disease while also educating the public. Help is available, but people need to be informed where assistance and information can be found. 
The CNAPT aims at promoting the concept of extending a helping hand by seeking community, public and volunteer assistance. Tomorrow will be better only through our efforts. 

TB in children
Special hospital facilities were non-existent for children afflicted by TB The CNAPT remedied this by constructing three childrens wards: Welisara Childrens Ward (1952) Hawake Memorial Ward, Kandana (1955) and Clarence Nathnielz Memorial Ward, Welisara (1960) which provided a total of 165 beds exclusively for children. The total cost of Rs. 900,000 was raised through the efforts of the CNAPT. 

Health Education
Since its inception the association has concentrated heavily on health education. The objective of the programme was to convey to the public that TB could be cured, patients must take prescribed treatment and those with suggestive symptoms be screened for they must take prescribed treatment and those with suggestive symptoms be screened for the disease. The programme also included lectures to specifically targeted groups, talks via electronic media, participation at public exhibitions and the distribution of TB related literature.
The proximity of the Health Education Centre to the Colombo Museum makes it accessible to any visitors to the Museum visit the CNAPTs Health Education Centre.

Trump moves toward China tariffs
	

U.S. President Donald Trump lit a slow-burning fuse on Thursday to launch long-promised anti-China tariffs, but his actions appeared to be more of a warning shot than the start of a full-blown trade war with Beijing.
A presidential memorandum signed by Trump will target up to $60 billion in Chinese goods with tariffs over what his administration says is misappropriation of U.S. intellectual property, but only after a 30-day consultation period that starts once a list is published.
Trump gave the Treasury Department 60 days to develop investment restrictions aimed at preventing Chinese-controlled companies and funds from acquiring U.S. firms with sensitive technologies.
The waiting periods will give industry lobbyists and U.S. lawmakers a chance to water down a proposed target list that runs to 1,300 products, mainly in technology sectors.
It also will create space for potential negotiations for Beijing to address Trumps allegations on intellectual property and delay the start of immediate retaliation against U.S. products from aircraft to soybeans.
I view them as a friend Trump said of the Chinese as he started his announcement. We have spoken to China and we are in the middle of negotiations.
