?AAVA? claims responsibility for sword attack on Jaffna Policemen
	
A group calling themselves the ?AAVA Gangsters? has claimed responsibility for the sword attack on two police officers in the Chunnakam market area. ?
The group said the incident was a retaliation for the death of two Jaffna university students who were allegedly shot the by police.
The group warned the police and the public to expect such incidents in the future as retaliation against activities that were destroying the culture and society of Jaffna.? ?
A rough translation of the poster put up on the walls of Jaffna claimed responsibility for other sword attacks in Jaffna and reasoned that those attacked were violent towards women.
The group stressed that punishment will be meted- out to those engaged in activities that would destroy the social norms and ideas in Jaffna. ?We, as Tamils cannot witness the destruction of our culture in Jaffna which is considered ?the land of culture? of Tamil Eelam,? a rough translation of the poster read. ?
The group also hinted that Tamil policemen would not be spared if they were to be part of the acts which were considered a detriment to the society. ?Although there were certain Sinhala Police Officers who supported the tragic incident the Tamil Police Officers played the lead role. According to the orders of Judge Ilancheliyan we will mete out appropriate punishment to all the Tamil Police Officers who carried the shooting under the direction of Sub Inspector Srigajan,? the poster said.
The sword attacks were a measure of preventing social evils in the peninsula which saved many villages from robberies and burglaries and many women from violence, the group claimed.?? ?
In statement previously, the police claimed the policemen were injured while trying to stop a robbery.(Pradeep Kumara)

DFCC Bank partners customers with products for every stage of life
	
Sri Lanka?s pioneering development bank, DFCC Bank, is steadily increasing its market share by providing innovative products and services backed by technology.?
Gillian Edwards, Senior Vice-President, Retail Assets & Leasing, DFCC Bank, believes that DFCC occupies a unique niche in both development and commercial banking which not only sets it apart in the banking industry, but also enables it to go beyond traditional boundaries.?
DFCC Bank?s latest innovation, the Vardhana Salary Booster, targets the younger generation and new entrants into the workforce. The product offers a permanent overdraft facility catering to that urgent, unexpected financial requirement that one could have.?
It?s an innovative product with a permanent credit line. ?Under normal circumstances, if one has an urgent need for cash, an application will have to be made for a temporary overdraft. However, in this instance the overdraft is ongoing, thus giving the account holder the convenience of drawing the funds as and when required. This product also supports the young executive just entering the work force as credit records are not sought. Obtaining a salary booster is a simple process as it only involves an assignment over salary from an employer accepted by the Bank. The minimum salary requirement is Rs. 30,000 with the overdraft extending to as much as 90 percent of two months? salary, based on the applicants repayment capacity.
The Vardhana Salary Booster also offers a bundle of value additions such as a free debit card, eBanking facility, joining fee waiver for credit cards and the Vardhana Virtual Wallet, along with a complementary Vardhana Junior Savings account, which can be opened for a minor of the applicant?s choice.
In addition, the applicant enjoys interest concessions on Personal Financial products, such as a 0.25 percent per annum reduction on Vardhana Sandella Housing Loans and 0.5 percent per annum reduction on Vardhana Nenasa education loans. Therefore, this product gives customers the financial freedom to further enhance their lifestyle.
Under the Personal Plus umbrella DFCC extends a host of products and services catering to the varying needs of an individual customer. For instance the Vardhana Personal loan offers as much as 20 times the applicants salary to finance one?s needs. Vardhana Sandella Housing loans are extended for purchase, construct or renovation. The Bank is also into apartment financing, partnering with a number of development projects.
Apart from the above, DFCC Bank offers vehicle and educational loans, pawning facilities, debit and credit cards as well as a range of deposit products at an attractive rate of interest. ?Personal Plus products are flexible and can be tailor made to suit each individual requirement.?
Gillian Edwards commented, ?We believe technology will be a key tool in product differentiation in the future. In our bid to target the younger generation who prefer to move away from brick and mortar models and adopt technology-based products, we devised the virtual wallet, which enables users to transact while on the move. The virtual wallet allows them to conduct banking transactions through internet, mobile or electronic devices, and is a perfect example of the agility of DFCC Bank to adapt to evolving technology by adopting advanced technology platforms. We believe technology will be a key tool in the area of product differentiation in the future.?
DFCC Bank is also breaking barriers by reaching out to the most remote areas in the country and we are proud of the fact that the majority of our retail business comes from areas out of Colombo, where a lot of the development is taking place,? she added.?
Gillian Edwards is a professional banker with 30 years of broad and diversified experience in branch management, personal financial services, leasing and retail banking. She was instrumental in setting up Personal Financial Services at DFCC Bank. Personal Banking is her forte as she enjoys interacting with people.

Funds available, but not the official approval
	
An old boy has come forward to fund the renovation of a swimming pool of a national school in Puttalam district now in a state of disrepair. 
?
On being told that the prior approval of a certain Minister was necessary for undertaking the repair work on the swimming pool, the old boy had phoned up the Minister 15 times seeking his approval, but the approval was yet come forth, they say. Every time the Minister is reminded of this request, he would say, ?I?ll attend to it today itself,? but he is yet to grant his approval, the old boys say.
Meanwhile, discreet inquiries made by interested parties have revealed that this swimming pool was constructed during the previous regime with the patronage of a Minister of that administration and the Minister now in charge of the subject was not invited to the ceremony held to mark the opening of the pool and they suspect that the latter is dodging his duty in this regard as he is still riding that spite.
The old boys discussing this issue asked themselves the question: ?If it is so difficult to get something done with funds made readily available, how difficult would it be to get something done if seeking of funds as well becomes necessary??

Govt. must be judged by its actions and not on statements made: Mangala
	
Commenting on the controversial speech made by the President recently, Foreign Minister Mangala Samaraweera today requested the government be judged on its actions and not on the statements made.
When the government?s commitment towards good governance and accountability was questioned Samaraweera stressed that whatever statements the President or anyone else had made, the ?government had not veered from its mandate to create a dynamic and vibrant democracy in Sri Lanka.
The Minister however, refused to make a statement on the governments? progress on the new resolution as he was not a part of the committee.
Speaking at a press briefing called to justify the government?s decision on abstaining from voting on the UNESCO?s resolution on Al-Aqsa Mosque or the Temple Mount the Foreign Minister said the decision was a matter of principle, which did not reflect the government?s stance on the Palestinian- Israeli conflict.
The resolution by UNESCO denouncing Israeli violation in and around al-Haram al-Sharif or Temple Mount saw 24 countries voting in favour of the resolution and 26 countries including Sri Lanka abstaining from vote.
The Minister pointed out that the site was a place of importance to three of the major religions in the world. Therefore the government had abstained from voting in keeping with its principle of supporting religious freedom and had not voted against the resolution as it was a Palestinian ally.
?Successive governments, no matter which party has been in power, has always supported Palestine. Sri Lanka has always recognized Palestine as a country and always promoted the two state solution as a way to resolve the conflict between the two countries.?
The decision to abstain from voting was being misinterpreted by ?bankrupt Muslim politicians? who defended the racist acts of the previous regime and were now using it as a political motivator.
?They defended the actions of the previous government which allowed racism to run rampant in the country. These individuals are now shedding crocodile tears in front of the Muslim community attempting to deceive the community of the governments true intentions,? he said.
The government will always protect the right to religious freedom and does not condone the racist acts that were allowed under the previous regime, the foreign minister said.
When questioned about media freedom in connected to the license of the Carlton Sports Network (CSN) being cancelled, the Minister said media freedom had nothing to do with the channel losing its license. ?It was established with funds that were embezzled and stolen. This is a completely different issue, it should not be connected to media freedom,? he said. (Nabeela Hussain)

I spoke according to my conscience: President
	
President Maithripala Sirisena, in an exclusive interview with Lankadeepa, said the speech he made at the Sri Lanka Foundation Institute (SLFI) with regard to the FCID action on heads of forces was drawn from his conscience.
?The objective of establishing the FCID is not to mingle in matters of various companies or individuals and to interrogate them. There are several divisions in the police department to handle such matters. There is deviation from the duties assigned to FCID. They should understand their duties and responsibilities. They should focus on large scale financial frauds.
Last year information was uncovered about large deposits amounting to $ 500 millions by several Sri Lankans in a Bank of a gulf country. An investigation was launched for which they required a letter signed by me and I gave it. These officers had made several visits to the relevant country for investigations and legal action was to be taken promptly. But so far nothing has happened. Why do they delay such big frauds?
What we hear is about cases over stealing flag posts, the transfer of vehicles and distribution of relief items.? ?
Their scope of duties is wide and people and the government expected them to do engage in their duties meaningfully without engaging in trivial pursuit of insignificant incidents. My speech at the SLFI was drawn from my conscience. When the Heads of the Forces are taken into custody, I must be aware of it as the Minister of Defence.
That is what I meant by the balance of the different institutes. Will those investigators take responsibility if these actions caused unrest? It is my responsibility to protect the forces and the honour of the war heroes. The investigations into the fraud and corruption should be done according to the proper procedure. They have full independence, but as the as the Minister of Defence, I should be informed.
?When things happen without my knowledge, unnecessary issues crop up in the country and tension mounts up. No person can challenge the authority of law. When we are called upon to act according to the law, how can we secure the institutions that are established to protect the law? As the President, I have a big responsibility. But some look at it with a different perspective,? the President said.

India may relax visa norms for SL monks
	
Days after the visit of? Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, the Indian government is examining a proposal to relax the visa regime for Buddhist monks from Sri Lanka.
More than 55,000 monks visit India every year on employment visa to work in monasteries at New Delhi, Dharamshala, Varanasi, Kushi Nagar and Bodh Gaya, said officials.
As per the rules, monks are required to pay a visa fee of $150 for employment permit every year.
The one-year visa can be extended up to five years after which they are required to go back to Colombo and apply fresh, added officials. Sri Lanka has not only sought in relaxation of rules for these monks but has also urged the Indian authorities to waive of the visa fees. (Economic Times)

JHU wants total crackdown on ex-LTTEers in NE
	
The Jathika Hela Urumaya (JHU) today claimed that ex-LTTE cadres might be behind the criminal activities taking place in the Northern and Eastern Provinces and called for a total crackdown on the 12,600 of them who were released after rehabilitation.
"The Government should carry out a thorough check on all former LTTEers to determine their current circumstances and activities and arrest if found to be connected to any criminal activities," JHU National Organiser Nishantha Sri Warnasinghe told a media briefing.
He claimed that two underground criminal gangs known as the ?Aava Group? and the ?Baava Group? allegedly led by ex-LTTEers are terrorising people in the Northern Province by indulging in thefts, crimes, kidnapping, extortion and other criminal activities.
Mr. Warnasinghe said they felt that ex-LTTEers who had fought against our security forces with their well-trained skills in the battlefield should not be released after a few months of rehabilitation.
?They still have their old attitudes prompting them to carry out anti-social activities. They are violating the peace, law and order in the provinces. Therefore, it is high time for the government to direct the law enforcement to put a stop to this chaotic situation,? he said.
Describing the deaths of the two Jaffna University students as unfortunate, he said the law should be enforced in all parts of the country without fear or favour regardless of caste, creed or social status.
Referring to the sword attack on the two Intelligent Service officers in Chunnakam, he said retaliation against the alleged police shooting was unacceptable because the law has to take its course.
Meanwhile, he said the Tamil politicians in the two provinces were responsible for the chaotic situation there because they were falling over each other to gain political mileage from what's happening there. (Piyumi Fonseka)

NDBIB successfully closes Mobitel?s e-Channelling acquisition
	
NDB Investment Bank (NDBIB) successfully advised Mobitel (Private) Limited in its recent acquisition of e-Channelling PLC. ?The transaction was announced on the floor of the Colombo Stock Exchange on September 5, and the acquisition was executed via a voluntary offer.?
NDBIB takes pride in having partnered Mobitel in its maiden acquisition and supporting the latter as it ventures in to value-added services, particularly in the fast growing e-health space.?
The controlling shareholder of e-Channelling, Senior Marketing System Asia Pte Ltd (SMSA), an entity based in Japan is one of the largest providers of healthcare information infrastructure in the region. SMSA entered into a share sale and purchase agreement undertaking to divest the entirety of its shareholding in e-hannelling amounting to 87.6 percent to Mobitel via the said voluntary offer. The voluntary offer was selected as the acquisition mechanism to cater to the needs of both Mobitel and SMSA whilst avoiding any negative impacts on the transaction arising from market volatilities.
This transaction comes hot on the heels of the Hela Clothing and Foundation Garments deal where NDBIB was involved in originating and conceptualising the entire transaction starting from connecting the two parties and highlighting the merits of a merger right up to deal structuring, negotiations and successful execution.?
Darshan Perera, CEO of NDBIB, commenting on the e-Channelling transaction said, ?We at NDBIB see a lot of opportunities in the M&A space and have been actively seeking transactions where we provide a broad range of services. Our expertise revolves around identifying suitable targets and partners for clients, structuring the deal to meet the needs of both parties, liaising with external consultants to carry out due diligence and managing the negotiations to ensure our clients expectations are achieved.?
NDBIB places utmost significance on maintaining strictest confidentiality and utmost professional standards to ensure that clients? interests in M&A transactions are well protected. NDBIB?s deal teams also ensure that all aspects of a transaction including the burden of coordinating with multiple due diligence partners are handled efficiently allowing the investors and target companies? management to continue focusing on business operations with minimum disruption. NDBIB?s involvement in the e-Channelling transaction began when the idea of acquiring the target was still at its infancy and NDBIB was requested to carry out a valuation exploring multiple scenarios on the value creation to the investor. NDBIB also advised and assisted the client in identifying suitable external consultants to carry out legal, financial and tax due diligence whilst helping to structure the due diligence in a focused manner to address the key risks to the investor. Subsequently, the acquisition mechanism was decided in consultation with the legal advisors to the transaction, whist NDBIB continued to provide additional services by liaising with external consultants carrying out due diligence and managing the Voluntary Offer process.
Commenting on NDBIB?s success in the M&A sphere, Nilendra Weerasinghe, Head of Corporate Advisory said, ?We have made a conscious effort to add value to our clients not only by simply brokering a deal but creating tangible value with novel ideas, deal structures and techniques to enhance synergies and minimise transaction costs. We always strive to follow global best practices during the process with a view to enhance the probability of a successful outcome in an M&A transaction?.
NDBIB is the investment banking subsidiary of NDB Capital Holdings, the largest full-service investment banking group in the country holding a complementary business portfolio consisting of fee-based and fund-based investment banking, wealth management, managing private equity and stock broking.

Only minimal force if vehicles disregard order to stop: IGP
	
Rejecting reports that the police had no right to shoot at a vehicle for disregarding an order to stop, IGP Pujith Jayasundara said today the police could use minimal and necessary force in such cases.
He said the 53rd Clause of the Police Ordinance explains how and when to use minimal and necessary force.
?The Criminal Procedure Code, Evidence Ordinance and the Penal Code too stipulate as to how the police could take action. What?s important when executing action is whether there is an environment created to use force.? However, when it comes to the incident in which two Jaffna University students were allegedly killed by policemen, it seems there was a shortcoming on the part of the police officers,? he told the journalists at an event held in Anuradhapura to mark the 150th Anniversary of the Police Service.
The IGP said it was questionable whether there was the need to open fire at the students as the incident was not a robbery, organised attack or other life threatening event.
When asked about the Chunnakam incident in which two police intelligent officers were attacked by a gang, he said the assailants had attacked the officers without knowing their profession since they were on civics.
However, a group called ?AAVA Gangsters? claimed the responsibility for the sword attack on the two police officers and said the incident was an act of retaliation for the death of the university students.? .? (Athula Bandara)

Player management a core issue ? Sumathipala
	
Player management, or the lack thereof, by Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) over the last three years had contributed to the current injury crisis being faced by the national team, SLC President Thilanga Sumathipala said yesterday, on the eve of the team?s departure for a tour of Zimbabwe.?
Captain Angelo Mathews was the latest player to be ruled out of action ? sustaining a calf injury that will take him three to four weeks to recover from ? joining a list of injured players, including a majority of Sri Lanka?s experienced fast bowlers ? Dhammika Prasad, Dushmantha Chameera and Nuwan Pradeep.? ?
?Since we have not managed over at least the last three years, we are experiencing good cricketers, who have come in line from under 19, 22, 23, who have played club cricket, played for the country, they go to the top level but they can?t sustain because they are badly managed. They have been badly managed because you (administrators) don?t know,? Sumapthipala said.? ?
?Players now play an average of 12 Test matches, over 30 ODIs, and about 10 T20 plus other games. So I think the player demand has expanded. We have to scientifically look into the player management, which we are doing now,? Sumathipala said, adding that the soon-to-be-opened Brain Centre ? where players will be bio-metrically assessed ? would address this.? ?
?It would take another eight to ten months to get the right results, because our cupboard is empty to replace, and there are injury prone players. We are very serious about it. We are working on it,? he said. ?Once we are up and running with our Brain Centre we will address all this.?? ?
Sumathipala singled out the captain as a prime example of why this is important.? ?
?There are certain players, like Angelo, who have certain ways of getting about ? weight transfer and the way they release pressure onto their body. He?s a world class all-rounder, so there is so much of demand, so much of pressure on the body. I don?t think it?s easy for a person like Angelo to be without an injury unless he takes a proper scientific approach. Angelo has played the highest number of matchdays amongst international cricketers during the last 18 months. He was forced to play, asked to play. So a player like him can?t go on. He has to pull out and take a genuine break for the body to recover,? Sumathipala said.? ?
?We don?t have enough of a recovery plan. (First) we have to make an assessment of the player. Then based on the assessment you make a bio-mechanic reading of the player. And then you call it player management. We don?t have a player management programme or a player plan. That is why we appointed a high performance manager. Now we are studying every player, not only on the field, but practice sessions, and then we give them a programme,? he said.? ?
Mathews will be replaced in the squad by opener turned middle-order batsman Upul Tharanga for the Zimbabwe tour, and with vice-captain Dinesh Chandimal also ruled out with a hand injury, Rangana Herath takes over as captain.? ?
Herath will lead an inexperienced squad, especially in the bowling department, but was confident of a series winning performance from the players he had.? ?
?The players in the squad have been playing in the mercantile tournament or for Sri Lanka ?A? side. Also confidence is on another level, after winning the Australian Test series,? he said.?
Addressing the perceived contract impasse between SLC and the players? Mathews said the media had done him and other national players injustice in how it reported the issue, saying there was no conflict and that they were glad to take a pay-cut if it meant other players were looked after.?
?It was a little disappointing what was said in the media about the team, and not signing the contracts, saying that we were not signing the contracts over disagreements with the pay. We would also like to see Sri Lankan cricket moving forward, and as national cricketers we?d like to see other players being looked after as well. Not just the ?A? team, but even domestic players need to be looked after if we are to take Sri Lankan cricket forward. Even in 2013 we were willing to take a pay-cut from image rights because SLC faced a financial crisis. (The media) Must not do injustice to players by reporting without the correct facts,? he said.? ?
Mathews said that he hoped to be fit for the crucial tour of South Africa which follows the Zimbabwe tour.? ?
?In 2016, I got hit with quite a few injuries and it?s very frustrating to watch the team play, and not being able to take part. I had about a one and half month?s break to rest and prepare, and be fit for the Zimbabwean series, but unfortunately there was a crack so I had to take an MRI scan and it revealed that I had multiple strains in the same leg. So I had to pull out and the expert doctors? panel advised me and SLC, not to send me on tour because it would jeopardize my South Africa series prospects as well. We are planning on taking a close look at why this is happening (recurrent injury). But hopefully I will be fit for the South African series,? he said.? ?
Mathews also said Herath deserved the leadership role in Zimbabwe.? ?
??I must congratulate Rangana Herath. If anyone is deserving, if anyone is capable of leading the team, it had to definitely be Rangana Herath because he?s a great team man, and the whole team is behind him. And both of us (Dinesh Chandimal and Mathews) are going to support him 100 per cent,? the injured captain said.? ?
Commenting on the incentive structured national contracts that were signed last week, Sumathipala said that the system would be beneficial to both the players and SLC.? ?
?We allocate a certain amount of funds for the welfare of the players and would focus on their international ratings considering the expenditure and the revenue of SLC. We allocate certain percentages for contract money, and the monies which the team gets whenever it wins. We have increased the amount which the team gets when it wins. Then the players and the country both benefit. Debutants and the senior players are not equal and we needed to consider the experience. We have decided to see that the players get a higher revenue over the next few years. Those who perform are attracted internationally and to achieve this they should perform for the country. The new method which we have adopted would bring benefit to the country and the players. Players also made suggestions to see that the team goes up in the rankings and themselves suggested that their payments should be slashed if the team comes down in the rankings. A performance-based system is welcomed by the players and this is a neutral approach,? Sumathipala added. (Shehan Daniel)

PM assures impartial probe on Jaffna killing
	
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe today assured Parliament that an independent inquiry would be conducted into the deaths of the two Jaffna University students.
He said investigations would be carried out in a transparent manner and highlighted the fact that the incident had come as a shock to all of them.
The Prime Minister was responding to a question asked by Opposition Leader R. Sampanthan on the tragedy. He demanded for an independent investigation to bring the perpetrators to book and said his party was concerned about this case because previous high profile criminal cases never led to any conviction.
Mr. Sampanthan thanked the government for the initial steps it had taken in arresting the five police personnel allegedly involved in the incident. He said the two students were travelling on a motorcycle when they met with this tragedy. He asked how the rider had gunshot injuries whereas the pillion rider died is said to have died in the crash if the police had fired at the back of the fleeing motorcyclists.

Political appointee says he is apolitical
	
There is a Ministry Secretary who refuses to attend official conferences held with the Prime Minister in the chair, they say.
?
This Ministry Secretary who himself is a political appointee maintains that the conferences the Prime Minister presides over are political events and he, being an apolitical official is not required to attend such conferences. So he has made it a point to attend only conferences chaired by his Deputy Minister or the Cabinet Minister.
When queried by the Deputy Minister why he was not participating in the conferences chaired by the Prime Minister, the secretary is reported to have retorted that he had got his appointment as he possessed the maximum qualifications for the post and therefore, he was not prepared to follow the dictates of political henchmen.

Short stint for tinted glasses
	
A week long operation inspecting vehicles with tinted or curtained front windows was launched countrywide by the police today.
Traffic DIG Palitha Fernando said vehicles should have clear windows in the front of the vehicle. ?The police will strictly implement this law and track down vehicles that have any kind of tinted glass or curtains in the front,? he said.
"Use of tinted glasses are appended in Government Gazette 875/08 on 16.06.1995 and Gazette number 1273/28 on 31.01,2003. It is an offence for the windscreen and the two shutters besides the driver to be tinted. A 20% tinted glass could be used only on the top portion of the windscreen,?the Gazette states.
However, it is legal to tint or curtain the back windows and VIP vehicles coming under the purview of ministries are exempted from this law, if they have the necessary approval.
?Motorists will be warned the first time but legal action will be taken if the tint or curtains are not removed,? the DIG said. (Darshana Sanjeewa)

Six enjoining orders issued against Seylan Bank and trust companies
	
Nine former employees of Seylan Bank Plc last week filed six separate cases in the District Court of Colombo before District Judge M.Y. Irshadeen against Seylan Bank Plc and six other trust companies, namely ESOTS Ltd, SESOT Ltd, SEYSHOP Ltd, SOTSE Ltd, SEYFEST Ltd, SEYFEST Ltd and SEYSHOP Ltd.
The former employees in the six cases were represented by Counsel Nishan Premathiratne with Pravi Karunaratne, who was instructed by Sanjay Fonseka.
The former Seylan Bank employees, through their complaints, took up the position that the six trusts were created by Seylan Bank in order to provide an additional benefit to the employees of ?Seylan Bank to be given to the employees at the point of cessation of employment from Seylan Bank.?
The six trust companies jointly own over 12 million shares of Seylan Bank, which is presently valued at over Rs. 1.1 billion.?
The former employees submitted that this additional benefit, which was to be given to these employees, was to be separate from gratuity and other payments. The former employees submitted to Court that Seylan Bank and the trust companies had neither paid the respective sums nor allocated the shares of Seylan Bank to the beneficiaries of the trust, who were the bank?s employees.
The former employees further told Court that through a letter dated 22 June 2016 Seylan Bank Plc had informed the Colombo Stock Exchange that the subject trust companies do not hold these shares for the benefit of the employees.?
The former employees also handed the Court several annual reports of Seylan Bank, in which the bank had categorically stated that the Employee Share Owning Trusts were being held for the benefit of the employees which were in contradiction of this letter.?
Citing these reasons, the former employees of the bank submitted through Counsel that there was an imminent risk that the shares of these trusts would be alienated by Seylan Bank in violation of the trust deeds
Pursuant to the submissions made by Premathiratne on behalf of the former employees, the District Judge granted six enjoining orders in respect of the six trusts with interim injunction notices restraining Seylan Bank Plc and six trust companies from disposing the Seylan bank shares other than for the specific purpose of paying the beneficiaries who are none other than the employees. ?
These enjoining orders will be in effect until 1 November 2016, when Seylan Bank and the six trust companies will be required to appear in court.

Sri Lanka gets more generous this year
	
Sri Lanka has moved up three notches and ranked fifth in the 2016 World Giving Index (WGI) compiled by the UK based Charities Aid Foundation (CAF) and released on Monday.
About 148,000 people in 140 countries were surveyed as part of the Gallup World Poll by the CAF to compile this year?s index, which looked at sub categories of number of people donating money, participation in helping a stranger and participation in volunteering time.
Sri Lanka was ranked eight last year and ninth, the year before. Myanmar continues to top the list as the most generous country in the world followed by the US, Australia, New Zealand and Sri Lanka.
?Myanmar maintains its number one ranking seen in 2015 but its position has grown stronger as the 2016 score is now five percentage points higher than its five year average. Other countries with strong upward trends this year are Sri Lanka, Indonesia, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Kenya,? the index report said.
Emerging eastern world power, China ranked at the bottom of the index as the least generous country followed by the Palestinian Territory, Yemen, Greece and the Democratic Republic of Congo which was ranked at 136.????? ?
India, Sri Lanka?s neighboring country, ranked at 91, Pakistan at 92, Afghanistan at 78, Nepal at 39, Bhutan at 18 and Bangladesh at 94 in the index.
John Low, Chief Executive of the CAF said the generosity of people, even in countries suffering from disaster and turmoil, was truly humbling.
?It?s amazing that more than half the people in the world said they helped a stranger. In every country, people have this in-built desire to give and help others. Governments should encourage that spirit of generosity and create the environment in which a strong civil society can flourish allowing people to reach out to those less fortunate than themselves,? he said.
The CAF is an international charity organisation registered in the UK, with a presence in nine countries covering six continents.

UNP protecting 'Ali Baba' in bond scam: JVP
	
The Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) today accused the UNP members in the parliamentary Committee on Public Enterprises (COPE) of attempting to protect ?Ali Baba? and recommend action only against a few of the thieves involved in the bond scam.
?Ali Baba and ten thieves are involved in this scam. But the UNP report does not highlight any misdemeanors of the main thief. This is what happened to the Rajapaksa regime as well. So we are not surprised about this,? JVP MP and COPE member Bimal Ratnayake said.
?In our report, we have recommended action against all those involved in the bond scam. We have no issue with anyone. Legal action should be taken against Central Bank officials and the Perpetual Treasuries."
He said UNP members in the COPE committee were attempting to draft a new report to protect corrupt officials while the majority of the COPE members had agreed to accept the report compiled by COPE headed by Sunil Handunnetti.
?Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe handed over the investigations into the Central Bank bond scam to the COPE but now the UNP members in the COPE are trying to prevent those who are involved in it being revealed. The motive of the UNP is to delay the COPE report,? Mr. Ratnayake said and added that the report would be presented in Parliament within 72 hours.
He said the COPE report was compiled based on three reports -- the report of the committee appointed by Prime Minister Wickremesinghe, the report submitted by former chairman DEW Gunasekera and the Auditor General's report.
Mr. Ratnayake said the UNP members could also present their report in Parliament but the people would know the truth when the original COPE report was presented in Parliament.
?People will know the recommendations and conclusions of the COPE committee when the report is presented in Parliament. It is up to the President, Prime Minister and the Speaker to take action against the culprits based on the report,? he said.
Mr. Ratnayake told a news conference that corrupt members of current government and those who were in the Rajapaksa government are perturbed by the COPE decision.
He said the UNP members were forcing the Auditor General to change his report on the bond scam and added that the COPE so far had acted based on the report of the Auditor General and his report had been an issue only on this incident.
Mr. Ratnayake said the JVP would not allow the UNP to use the COPE committee to protect the corrupt.(Ajith Siriwardana)
