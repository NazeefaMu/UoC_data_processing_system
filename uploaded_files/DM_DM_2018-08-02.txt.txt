Aloysius, Palisena, Salgado, Devathantri produced in Court as suspects
	
Perpetual Treasuries Ltd defacto owner Arjun Aloysius, its CEO Kasun Palisena, its Chief Dealer Nuwan Salgado and the IT executive Sachith Devathantri were today produced in court as suspects into the parallel magisterial inquiry conducted over the Bond scam on deleting phone call data from Perpetual Treasuries Ltd voice recording system and fabricating evidence to the Bond Commission.
Sachith Devathantri and Nuwan Salgado were arrested by the CID and produced in court, while Aloysius and Palisena were produced from the prison as they were in remand over the main Bond scam inquiry.
Perpetual Treasuries Ltd as the corporate entity was also named as a suspect into the inquiry by the prosecution.
Filing a further report, the prosecution said that they were expecting to make suspects, Sachith Devathantri and Nuwan Salgado as crown witnesses into the inquiry in future.
Subsequently, Fort Magistrate Lanka Jayaratne released Devathantri and Salgado on a surety bail of Rs. 300,000 each and also ordered the passports of them to be tendered in courts.
Earlier, in October 2017, the Court had imposed a travel ban on the suspects.
Suspects Aloysius and Palisena were remanded till August 9 by the Magistrate.
However, suspects, Devathantri and Salgado were taken into remand custody as they failed to tender their passports to the court yesterday.
The suspects were held liable by the prosecution over under the Penal Code, Registered Stock and Securities Ordinance and Computer Crimes Act in connection with the revelation transpired during the proceedings of the Bond Commission.
Senior Deputy Solicitor General Haripriya Jayasundara and Senior State Counsel Lakmini Girihagama appeared for the CID.
Earlier, PTL had told the Bond Commission that it had given all the data it had with the voice recording system. However, after startling confessions made by PTL IT expert Sachith Devatantri and its Chief Dealer Nuwan Salgado before the Commission, it was revealed that there was a deletion of some voice recordings.
Subsequently, the Attorney General instructed the CID to initiate a criminal investigation with regard to the revelation.
In that startling revelation, PTL IT executive Sachith Devathantri on August 31, 2017, admitted before the Presidential Commission of Inquiry that he had deleted several phone recordings from PTLs voice recording system on the instructions of the Chief Dealer of PTL, Nuwan Salgado on July 5, 2017.
Mr Devathantri had also disclosed that it was the altered phone recordings that were subsequently provided to the Commission in the latter part of August 2017, as opposed to what PTLs CEO Kasun Palisena had ascertained in his affidavit earlier that they had provided all data to the investigation.
Meanwhile, Perpetual Treasuries Ltd owner Arjun Aloysius and its CEO Kasun Palisena were also ordered to be re-remanded till August 9 by the magistrate over the magisterial inquiry in which they were accused of abetting and conspiring with Arjuna Mahendran to misappropriate public funds worth Rs. 688 million during the Bond auction held on February 27, 2015.

ASP Liyanage challenges Dy. Minister Pathirana to a debate
	
Ambassador to Qatar A.S.P. Liyanage who was accused by Deputy Minister Buddhika Pathirana of running the Sri Lankan school in Qatar for money instead of executing the diplomatic duties entrusted to him, said that he would resign from his ambassador post if the deputy minister proved the allegations made against him.
Deputy Minister Pathirana at a press briefing on Tuesday (1) said that the President, Prime Minister and the Foreign Ministry should take action against the ambassador who is attempting to snatch about Rs. 450 million (QR 9mn) worth of funds belonging to the Sri Lankan school.
He also alleged that the ambassador is trying to dissolve the school board and change the constitution in order to privatize the school.
Responding to these allegations, Mr. Liyanage alleged that the former chairman of the board of the Sri Lankan school in Qatar, Kumudu Fonseka had been misappropriating school funds for nearly 17 years and had donated money to several ministers. The deputy minister was one of those who had received money from him and the accusations made against me was an attempt by the dy. minister to protect the former chairman of the board, Liyanage alleged.
 I request the deputy minister to come for a live television debate over the allegations made by him. If he is able to prove that I am the wrongdoer, I will resign from my post. And if he fail to do so he should resign from the post he holds as a deputy minister, he said.(Darshana Sanjeewa)

Bobby or how life looks up when the keys gone
	

it was seen by over62 mn. people
	
	The music was by that gifted duo, Lakshmikanth & Pyarelal

I sometimes get accused of ignoring Bollywood films and Hindi film songs in my writing. Well, its time to confess: I am a big fan of both. I should actually be grateful to that genre for the relatively happy state that I find myself in today, professionally speaking. If I hadnt cut school so much to see Westerns at the New Olympia and Hindi films at the Crown, Ritz and Lido cinemas, I would have undoubtedly passed more exams to become a boring bureaucrat. 
But I wasnt tall enough to get into a cinema to see Raj Kapoors Bobby (1973). I had to wait for VHS technology to see it. But those mesmeric songs were regularly aired by the SLBC, and available in cassette format and then as CDs, too. Two are exceptionally beautiful  Me Shyar Tho Nahin and Chabi Koi Jaye. Its the latter that is particularly close to my heart, and this article is about that one. If Shakespeare spoke Hindi he would have undoubtedly placed it somewhere within his play A Midsummer Nights Dream. It has all that magical allure and charm. 
But first, a few words about Bobby. It was a runaway success in India and, interestingly enough, in the former Soviet Union, where it was seen by over 62 million people. It remains an exceptional Bollywood creation in more ways than one. For one thing, it was a story of multi-ethnic, multi-religious love, between Raj Nath, a rich businessmans son from Mumbai, and Bobby Braganza, the daughter of a poor Christian fisherman from Goa. 

Lakshmikanth and Pyarelal preferred the piano accordion. It was Raj Kapoors trademark, too, and he used it to great effect in his films Sangam and Mera Naam Joker. This instrument is used to haunting effect in Chabi Koi Jaye

Rich, Hindu, and all that, versus poor, Christian and all that. And, shiver me timbers, the father catches fish for a living. An unlikely pair for everlasting happiness, but you guessed right. This story has a happy ending. Raj Kapoors crammed storyline and gamble -- Hindu vs. Christian, multi-ethnic, rich vs poor, plus the sheer exuberance of Bobbys music, created a very out of Aladdins lamp cinematic alchemy which ensured box office success. As for the music, one suspects that its music of this kind which has kept the union of India from disintegrating for so long. 
The music was by that gifted duo, Lakshmikanth Pyarelal. In 1973, Bangladesh as a country was just two years old, and Indians smarting under socialist-era controls were dreaming of more reliable Western (i.e Japanese) technology. Indira Gandhis eldest son Sanjay was dreaming of building an all-Indian car called Maruti. In cricket, Sunil Gavaskar made his international debut (against the West Indies) in 1971 and Sachin Tendulkar was still in the cradle in 1973 (he was named Sachin in honour of Bollywood composer Sachin Dev Burman). S. D, and his son Rahul Dev, with their love of trumpets turned the 1970s into the baroque era of Bollywood film music. 
Lakshmikanth and Pyarelal preferred the piano accordion. It was Raj Kapoors trademark, too, and he used it to great effect in his films Sangam and Mera Naam Joker. This instrument is used to haunting effect in Chabi Koi Jaye. The scene shows the two lovers locked up in a room, and the opening lines echo this unenviable situation  Ham tum, ek kamra me bandh ho/Chabi Ko Jaye which means: You and me, we are now locked up in this room; where is the key which sounds like a really good existential question. 
The two lovers were played by two new faces  Raj Kapoors son Rishi, and newcomer Dimple Kapadia. Both look too old to be teenagers, even though she was only 16 at the time, but never mind. She disappeared (due to marriage to actor Rajesh Khanna) after winning a Best Actress award for Bobby, and was dubbed a sex symbol after her comeback in the 1980s. 
As for the male lead, this was a time when Bollywood actors could be described as pretty rather than handsome. Rajesh Khanna, Shammi Kapoor, Rajendra Kumar and now Rishi all fit the type (Sashi Kapoor with his enigmatic face escapes this casting). If they went to the gym as Bollywood actors must do now if they are to survive, it didnt show. If their female counterparts were buxom and a bit on the fleshy side, thats how the audiences liked it. 
So, at the start of the song, we see the couple all dressed up nicely and locked up inside a cosy guest house room. We hear the voice before the music starts. The singers are Shailendra Singh and Lata Mangeskar. If the former was eclipsed by Mohammad Rafi, it certainly wasnt his fault. Hes a marvellous singer and here, that nuanced melodic beauty so characteristic of Indian singers, which comes from training the voice not just chromatically but in microtones, comes across remarkably, with heart stopping tenderness. 
After her opening lines, Dimple lies down on the bed, and he spreads himself out next to her obligingly. 
But it seems that he has other ideas. He dreams of escape. And so, in the next scene, they are running in the woods, at night, and her dress has got even shorter. He talks about a thakur (bandit), and climbs a creeper. All the time, that haunting opening line (hum tum) keeps recurring, punctuated by the equally haunting accordion melody line of tone-semi tone-tone progression. That nearly killed me when I first heard it, and I still have that feeling after forty odd years. Now we see them running together along a sunny mountain road. Dimple looks quite a stunner in that white polka dress  no wonder millions of Indian women went crazy over polka dots. But in the next scene, they are back in their locked room, rolling over each other on that comfy bed. 

As for the male lead, this was a time when Bollywood actors could be described as pretty rather than handsome. Rajesh Khanna, Shammi Kapoor, Rajendra Kumar and now Rishi all fit the type (Sashi Kapoor with his enigmatic face escapes this casting)

But the spell is finally broken. We see them back on the bed, and she starts and shakes her head, as if waking up from a dream. Next, they are seen walking out, hand in hand, to the repeated refrain of chabi ko jaye. Today, dislike of Christians has been overtaken by hatred of Muslims. Some contemporary Bollywood film makers, such as Sanjay Leela Bhansali, reflect this mood in technically magnificent but artistically compromised films such as Padmavati. If Raj Kapoor could have foreseen this, he would have kept his two teenage lovers locked up in that room forever.

## Title: CFPs grumble over their qualifications being undermined

CFPs grumble over their qualifications being undermined
	
Consultant Family Physicians (CFPs) are up in arms against the Health Ministrys deliberate failure to place them in charge of primary care units in main hospitals in the country, but confining them to rural hospitals. In the event their services are undermined and if they are not allowed to discharge their duties in main hospitals, there is a looming danger of their being a brain drain of professional in primary care. 
For these CFPs, serving a few patients who visit rural hospitals is a waste of their expertise. When considering the knowledge theyve acquired after going through six years of rigorous training to become consultants, these professionals would wish to serve patients who throng primary care units, better known as Out Patients Department (OPD), at main hospitals. Patients visit these hospitals, which function in an organised manner, seekingquality treatment. 
According to them the autocratic attitude of some administrators at the Ministry of Health has deprived patients the opportunity to receive quality treatment at an organised institute. This situation exists at these institutes because these specialists have not been appointed as Heads of Primary Care Units in specialist hospitals (base hospitals and above). 

According to these sources, this issue had been brought to the notice of Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne who had patiently listened to their woes given instructions to place the CFPs in their due positions. But the ministers instructions have been to no avail


Sri Lanka Association of Specialist Family Physicians (SLASFP) raised concern as to how a few Consultant Community Physicians, who hold senior administrative positions at the Ministry of Health, have taken a firm decision not to instate CFPs at main hospitals in the country. These CFPs are confined to peripheral and rural hospitals. For them, working in a rural hospital is a mere waste of knowledge when considering the training theyve received abroad. These CFPs are not seeking facility or perks, but are making a plea to allow them serve the sick that come in numbers to OPDs in main hospitals. 

A patient receives treatment

All CFPs have been posted to rural and peripheral hospitals while Secondary Care Internal Medicine Physicians, widely known as Visiting Physicians (VP), have been assigned to oversee all OPDs in main hospitals. When these VPs have to manage the medical wards in these hospitals they have been assigned with an extra duty to work as VP-OPD, a member of the SLASEF told the Daily Mirror on conditions of anonymity. 
According to sources, when a VP is entrusted with the task to manage the OPD in addition to his medical wards, the quality of treatment cannot be guaranteed. Unlike in other disciplines, to become a CFP we have to obtain a five-year post intern experience to qualify and sit for the selection exam for the Diploma in Family Medicine. Those who qualify through this exam have to undergo a years training where there are sessions seven days a week. Those who qualify are trained during the Diploma in Family Medicine as trainees. After the completion of one year, they are eligible to sit for the Post Graduate Diploma exam in Family Medicine. Those who pass this exam are eligible to sit for the selection exam for MD in Family Medicine. Those who qualify will become Registrar in Family Medicine. After this stage they have to undergo a three-year training period.
Those who complete this three-year training period successfully can sit for the MD in Family Medicine exam. Successful candidates will become Senior Registrars. The next step for them would be to undergo a one year training both in Sri Lanka and abroad. After these two years are completed they are eligible to function as Board Certified Consultants in Family Medicine. We have sacrificed eleven years since post internship to become a CFP. If these administrators undermine our discipline despite such a rigorous training and if our due posts are not given, brain drain will be inevitable as the United Kingdom has relaxed certain immigration rules to attract more foreign Family Medicine Specialists. There is a dearth of 10, 000 CFPs in UK, sources said. 
According to these sources, this issue had been brought to the notice of Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne who had patiently listened to their woes given instructions to place the CFPs in their due positions. But the ministers instructions have been to no avail. 


Services not obtained
We had a few rounds of discussions with the Health Minister and these administrators. The Minister and Deputy Director General (Health Services) II, Dr. Amal Harsha de Silva agreed to our proposals and instructed these officials to instate us as Head of Critical Care Units in main hospitals. But all these directives have fallen on deaf ears. Unlike in rural hospitals, where the OPD turnover is less than 50 patients a day, more than 250 to 500 patients visit main hospitals to receive primary care treatment daily. The Government spent more than Rs.5 million to educate a CFP which was done by providing them with quality foreign training. These sessions helped them obtain the necessary knowledge to manage OPDs. But the money spent on us has gone in vain as our services are not obtained properly, sources further alleged. 

There is a necessity to have Specialist Medical Officers in primary care. Thats why our discipline was included in appendix 1 in the service minute. In addition, the World Federation in Medical Education, which is a funded organisation of the WHO that maintains the standard of medical collages in the world, had stated that general practice of family medicine should be included in the six major subjects that should be taught at all medical colleges. The six subjects are surgery, psychiatry, gynecology & obstetrics, internal medicine and pediatrics. If these six subjects are not taught at medical colleges, the MBBS Degree they offer is not recognised. When family medicine is well recognised internationally, due to unknown reasons, the few administrators here do not want to give us our due positions, sources complained. 
According to these sources the Ministry should employ the CFPs to strengthen the primary care units in rural hospitals in order to prevent the specialist hospitals being over-crowded. 



If anyone says that the Health Ministry has sidelined these Consultant doctors by not appointing them to main hospitals it is a baseless allegation.
-Dr. Sussie Perera


Meanwhile allegations have also been levelled against the Health Ministry for sidelining CFPs when formulating the Policy on Healthcare Delivery for Universal Health Coverage. This is a US $ 200 million World Bank project which is focused on strengthening the primary health care system in the country. 
This project is on primary curative care, but none of the Consultant Family Physicians was asked to for their opinion when formulating the policies. The Minister is unaware that our representation was not there when forming the frame work to which the Cabinet approval had been granted. On page 50 of the draft Essential (Health) Service Package it says that the CFPs have to train Medical Officers (MO) in primary care units for three months. It is only after the training period that they will be on par with the CFPs and these trained MOs should not refer any patient to a CFP for specialised opinion. However they can refer patients to a secondary or tertiary care specialist. We became specialists not to train MOs and once these MOs are trained for three months they are on par with a CFP. If the Ministry of Health can determine that the primary care medical officers, who received a three-month training, are equal to CFPs, why did they spent millions of rupees to train us to become Board Certified Specialists There again, these administrators want to undermine our professional qualifications, sources complained. 

Baseless allegations
However Ministry of Health Organization Development Director Dr. Sussie Perera said that the reason why the CFPs have been deployed at rural hospitals is to strengthen the primary care units in those hospitals. 
If anyone says that the Health Ministry has sidelined these Consultant doctors by not appointing them to main hospitals it is a baseless allegation. We really need the help of these doctors to strengthen these family care units at small hospitals. Their services are essential to us, Dr. Perera said.

Patients awaiting treatment

According to Dr. Perera, CFPs are needed to address the overcrowded situation at OPDs in specialist hospitals. These CFPs have the responsibility of managing the divisional hospitals effectively and send the message across to the community that the nearest hospital for the patients possesses the best primary care units. Once the quality of the treatments given at these primary care units in divisional hospitals are proven, then the people in the area would not want to bypass these hospitals and visit specialist hospitals and spend their time and money. This will help to reduce the number of patients that visits main hospitals and aid in sorting overcrowding. We do not want the health system to be centralised, but what we want is the place to be regionalized, Dr. Perera said. 

If these MOs refer the patients that need secondary or tertiary care to the CFPs then the patient has to spendmore time to go from onedoctor to another

When asked as to why they have proposed to make these CFPs train the primary care MOs, which in turn will put the latter on par with the Consultants, Dr. Perera said that they have not yet taken any decision regarding who the trainers will be. However Dr. Perera added that once the MOs are trained there will not be a necessity to refer the patients to CFPs, and that trained MOs can direct patients straight to secondary or tertiary care doctors, if needed. 
There are 960 divisional hospitals and primary medical care units (PMCU) in the country. At this moment we have only 13 CFPs and this number is not enough to manage all OPDs in divisional hospitals. So that is why we want to train the primary care MOs to manage the hospitals where CFPs are not deployed. We want these doctors to set up model primary care units and ensure that the patients in their respective areas do not visit main hospitals. According to our concept, we do not want to harass the patient, but need to refer them to the right place without any hassle. If these MOs refer the patients that need secondary or tertiary care to the CFPs then the patient has to spend more time to go from one doctor to another. This procedure will not help our concept and this can once again lead the patients to seek treatment from specialist hospitals, Dr. Perera added. 
When asked as to who will be in charge of the OPDs at specialist hospitals, Dr. Perera said that as there will be a huge a scope for managing work, those who are engaged in the health administrative work will be appointed as Primary Care Clinical Managers. 

SLASFP raised concern as to how a few Consultant Community Physicians, who hold senior administrative positions at the Ministry of Health, have taken a firm decision not to instate CFPs at main hospitals in the country

Responding to allegations levelled against the ministry officials for not getting CFPs involved when drafting the policies on the Essential (Health) Service Package, Dr. Perera said that although they were not involved in the first round, their officials were present at discussions from the second meeting on wards. 
Senior Professors in family medicine took part in formulating the policy. We have not sidelined them, but have obtained their proficient knowledge, Dr. Perera emphasised.

## Title: Dispense ad hoc ratios and bonus seats for PC Elections

Dispense ad hoc ratios and bonus seats for PC Elections
	

It is reported in the press that the Delimitation Commission has proposed to introduce a 50:50 ratio and increase the number of bonus seats to tide over the issues of stability and minority representation in the Provincial Councils. At the outset, it is pertinent to mention that applying such ad hoc ratios and bonus seats changing with every election, amply proves that they are not scientifically founded on empirical evidence and research. Let me briefly deal with the said issues which unfortunately seem to be still entrenched in the minds of some of our leading politicians, political pundits, academics and civil activists in a parochial sense.

Stability in Provincial Councils

This outmoded concept founded on maintaining an absolute majority in the Council for all purposes is not in keeping with the principles of a modern democracy where all parties should contribute to arrive at the best solution favouring the Council/country after a healthy debate.
It is the expectation of the sovereign voter. Maintaining an absolute majority by one party, will in fact lead to misguided, dictatorial decisions. Hung or unstable Councils/Parliament should become misnomers when professionals with country at heart deliberate and decide on the best fine-tuned options for the Council/Parliament/Country.
To ensure advent of political professionals, the Election Commission should stipulate stringent eligibility criteria for prospective candidates by Rule of Law as the present day voters wish to have political professionals as their representatives. The writers proposed criteria and procedure has already appeared in the press.

Minority Representation
The question here is, why should a section of the population imbued with a minority feeling downgrade themselves and beg preferential treatment on the one hand and why should the majority feel good by giving preferential treatment to their fellow citizens on the other
It is very unfortunate and sad that we are still not ready to think as Sri Lankans having equal rights and duties. If we adopt the short sighted Bonus seat and Ratio method and continue to be afflicted with this parochial Majority Vs Minority syndrome, our country will perpetuate the ethnic conflict like the beggars wound and will never ever come out of it.
Therefore, it is high time that, at any level of elections, all votes be considered as cast by Sri-Lankans attaching equal value to every valid vote. Only this concept can iron out the elusive issue of voting based on ethnicity, religion, cast etc. The application of proportionate arithmetic in a cut and dry scientific manner, to determine the no. of seats won in a District by each party, will ensure an equal value for each Sri Lankan vote in a District.


Promotion of Sri Lankan concept
As stated above, the electoral process will surely trail blaze this elusive paradigm shift towards a cultural and attitudinal change of treating all citizens as SRI LANKANS.
No doubt, the mass media shall play a crucial role in this effort through suitable programmes and Tele Dramas facilitated by the Ministry of National Integration as well as Education.

Doctors to launch 24-hour strike tomorrow
	
Private and public medical officers will launch a 24 hour work stoppage from 8 am tomorrow urging the authorities to resolve ten issues which impact health professionals and the general public.
The GMOA last week called for a work stoppage over ten trade union demands including the revision of the Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with Singapore and reduction of high taxation upon medical officers and private hospitals.
Tomorrows strike will be launched in all districts, teaching and general hospitals except at the Lady Ridgeway Hospital for Children, Apeksha Hospital Maharagama, De Soysa Maternity Hospital and National Blood and in the peripheral hospital units.
GMOA Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge said although the demands were explained to President Maithripala Sirisena and the health authorities during the last two months, their issues were not addressed.
Meanwhile, Dr. Naveen de Zoysa responding to a statement made by Minister of Telecommunication, Digital Infrastructure and Foreign Employment Harin Fernando, invited him to join with the medical officers strike stating that struggle was not for GMOAs benefit but for the betterment of the patients.
However, the GMOA said that it will call-off their strike at any moment if President Sirisena intervenes and gives them a written assurance to resolve their issues. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

President Maithripala Sirisena while opening a jogging track in Polonnaruwa threw a challenge in a lighter vein at IGP Pujith Jayasundara to do 100 crunches on the track after which the IGP took up the challenge.
The President was later heard asking him to stop saying "enough, enough, otherwise I will have to look for another IGP".
The conversation as follows:
IGP - How many crunches do I have to do sir
President - A Hundred, a Hundred (People Laughing). The IGP is not an ordinary person.
IGP calls to an officer to count the number of crunches.
President: Police constables should do ten crunches, an IP should do 15 crunches, one ASP should do 20 crunches, 30 crunches for an SSP.
IGP : Its ten crunches. (Again the IGP wants a police officer to count) Keep counting',
President: A DIG should do 50 crunches. Senior DIG should do 75 crunches and the IGP, 100 crunches. (People laughing)
President: It is enough now, otherwise I will have to look for another IGP.

EC wants to meet JO MPs over PC Polls
	
In the wake of mounting pressure from the Opposition to conduct the elections to the Provincial Councils, the Elections Commission had sought a meeting with the MPs of the United Peoples Freedom Alliance (UPFA) sitting in the Opposition, sources said yesterday.
Around 70 UPFA MPs sit in the Opposition under the banner of the Joint Opposition. These UPFA MPs have demanded the elections be conducted as early as possible.
Against the backdrop, Elections Commission Chairman Mahinda Deshapriya is reported to have sought to meet with these UPFA MPs in the opposition.
It is learnt that Mr Deshapriya was planning to brief the MPs on the inability to conduct the elections due to the enactment of fresh legislation to change the electoral system.
The Government is currently caught in a legal dilemma being unable to hold elections either under the old system (PR) or the new system (FPP and PR). (Kelum Bandara)

Empowering  the underprivileged
	
Treading the path of their founder, Eugene De Mazenod, Oblates now support a scholarship foundation to help the less fortunate to complete their education

Eugene De Mazenod, the young Frenchman of noble birth, who later became the Bishop of Marseilles and Founder of the Missionary Oblates of Mary Immaculate, paved a path of love for the Oblates to follow and accomplish their missionary work. 
The French Revolution and its aftermath had left the Church in France in a state of sad disarray and devastation. France was a shattered society. It was at this hour of terrible tragedy that Eugene De Mazenod with great courage and confidence founded the Missionaries of Provence in 1816. His ardent desire was to revitalize the Church and bring hope to people living in despair. It was ten years later in 1826 that Pope Leo XII approved the Institute with its constitution and rules conferring on it the name  Congregation of the Missionary of Oblates of Mary Immaculate (OMI). 
Eugene, though never a missionary himself, was a true missionary in mind and heart, full of zeal and ardour, who could inspire and invigorate others to engage in missionary work. Thus from the beginning, the outlook of the Congregation was missionary and this legacy is carried on by the Oblates, with the same zeal and enthusiasm shown by their founder. Eugene accepted to send his Oblates at the request of Mgr. Bettacchini, who was residing in Jaffna as Pro-vicar and Coadjutor of the Vicar Apostolic of Colombo. The first batch of Oblates with Fr. Etienne Semeria as their Superior, arrived in Ceylon, as Sri Lanka was then known, from France. Eugene De Mazenod loved to refer to this tear drop island in the Indian Ocean, as the most beautiful island in the world and to him and the Oblate missionaries, the most promising mission. The missionaries were involved not only in parochial ministry, but also in administrative and educational activities in the island. 

Long history
A closer look at the history of the Oblates in Sri Lanka reveals how God has been part of the long history and how the mission of Jesus has been at work among the people through the Oblates. The history of the Oblates in Sri Lanka is the story of a group of persons, who have dedicated their lives to the mission of Jesus Christ, by emulating the example and zeal of their founder, St. Eugene. The Oblate missionaries went a long way in sustaining and continuing the great work of Saint Joseph Vaz, the apostle of Ceylon. It is undoubtedly the Oblate congregation that has contributed much to the building up of the Sri Lankan Church. 
Eugene De Mazenod from the day of his ordination had a special concern and love for children and youth. He realized that youth would be the future of the church and the society. This same love and concern of St. Eugene for children and youth has inspired a group of Oblates, Rev. Fr. Dennis Iddamalgoda, the founder and the Foundation Committee members Rev. Fathers Clement Waidyasekara, Justin Silva, Angelo Wijewickrama, and Ajith Wellington to start the De Mazenod Scholarship Foundation with the noble aim of continuing St. Eugenes love and care for children and youth. The Foundation was inaugurated on 21st May 2016 when the Oblates in Sri Lanka celebrated the 200th anniversary of the Foundation of the Congregation, on the feast day of their beloved founder St. Eugene De Mazenod. This is one way of sharing the joy of the Oblates for the numerous blessings they continue to receive from God. The De Mazenod Scholarship Foundation will be a new sign of missionary activity in Sri Lanka, re-reading and re-energizing the Founders initial inspiration evangelizare pauperibus visit me, paupers evangelizantur. 

De Mazenod Scholarship Foundation
The vision of the De Mazenod Scholarship Foundation is to empower the underprivileged children and youth through education. In view of realising this vision the Foundation decided to partially fund the students who are eligible, but have no financial means to complete their university education; to inculcate in children and youth the values that enable them to transcend religious, social, ethnic and cultural barriers; to enhance the life situation of children and youth to enjoy their self-worth and to be open and available to serve the Sri Lankan society at large; to help children and youth gain necessary skills in leadership and thus being equipped with skills to remain sensitive to people in general and to the poor and the needy in particular. 
It was with great joy and anticipation that the Annual Get-together and presentation of Scholarships to new students was held on 7th July 2018 at the Centre for Society and Religion, Fatima Church, Maradana. Rev. Fr. Angelo Wijewickrama welcomed the invitees, students and parents. Very Rev. Fr. Irwin Moraes, Provincial Supervisor of the Missionary Oblates of Mary Immaculate, Sri Lanka was the Chief Guest. In his address to the gathering, he thanked Fr. Dennis Iddamalgoda and his team for the initiative taken to establish the Foundation. He encouraged the recipients to make use of this opportunity given to them and find fulfillment in their lives, and to remember those in need and assist them when they are able to do so.
In his address Rev. Fr. Justin Silva expressed his joy and thanked the Oblates for this opportunity of awarding scholarships to undergraduates as it is a permanent commitment to the education and future of our youth. The students should make it their priority to devote themselves to their studies and finish on time. He gave examples of persons worthy of emulation so they would be motivated to pursue their studies well. Rev. Fr. Dennis Iddamalgoda was not able to be present and he was represented by his Sister, Rev. Sr. Martin de Porres. Thirteen new students were awarded with scholarships bringing the total number of beneficiaries to 38 undergraduates. The vote of thanks was proposed by Rev. Fr. Ajith Wellington. 
All preparatory and related work was handled by Rev. Frs. Ajith Wellington and Justin Silva who together with Rev. Fr. Dennis Iddamalgoda and other Oblates should be lauded for their committed service towards this worthy cause, as they strive to shoulder the enormous responsibility of continuing the mission of Jesus.

Executing certain category of convicts absurd: JO
	
The Governments selective approach towards the implementation of the death penalty on a certain category of convicted criminals was absurd, the Joint Opposition yesterday said.
Addressing a news briefing, Professor G.L. Peiris said the President declared that the convicts who were sentenced to death for drug trafficking and still continue to traffic drugs from inside the prison would be executed.
However, there was a notable case where a drug smuggler conspired and assassinated a High Court Judge who was hearing his case.
The drug smuggler was later sentenced to death on charges of the killing of the Judge but not on drug smuggling.
If the Government goes ahead with executing convicted drug smugglers, this convict will not be hanged, he said.
He said Justice Minister Thalatha Atukorala had said recently that the Government has not come to a final decision yet on implementing the death penalty.
This shows that the policies of the Government are being made based on sudden thoughts. There is no content policy-making process, he said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

Germany arrests ex-LTTEer over alleged war crimes in SL
	
German authorities have arrested a Sri Lankan man suspected of involvement in killing captured government soldiers as a member of the Tamil Tigers rebel group a decade ago.
Federal prosecutors said a judge ordered Thursday the 36-year-old, identified only as Sivatheeban B. because of German privacy rules, detained pending a potential indictment. He was arrested Wednesday in the Duesseldorf area, suspected of committing war crimes and membership in a foreign terrorist organization.
Prosecutors say he belonged to the Tamil Tigers from 2006-2009. They allege that, in 2008, he tied up 16 soldiers and guarded them as they were driven to a site where they were shot.
Sri Lanka's civil war ended in 2009 when government forces defeated the rebels, who fought to create a separate state for ethnic minority Tamils.(Daily Mail)

Giving Alms
	
Last week in Colombo, a generous group of local women gave alms to the 70 young priests at Wickremashila Pirivena temple by making them breakfast. Headed by Mrs Kanthi Ubayakumara, the kind hearted friends made vegetable rotis and faluda for the priests. Even though Mrs Ubayakumara doesnt have a lot to give, she strives to help those around her and has been doing so since she was a child.
Her motto dun dey suwandai, kae dey gandai (What you give has a sweet fragrance, what you eat stinks) has been passed down by her mother and in turn she has passed it down to her daughter, Sulo, who also helped with making the breakfast.

Keeping the  Mount Lavinia Beach beautiful
     	 
  At the Daily Mirror, we believe that climate change is one of the greatest threats that we, as Sri Lankans, will face in the future.  Therefore, we intend to provide our readers with local and international content with the objective to educate and inspire. We would also like to learn from our valued readers about any ongoing initiatives in making Sri Lanka a more sustainable nation.   
 We aim to explore sustainable ways of living that have the most positive impact on not just our natural environment, but also for humans and animals.  
While topics such as global warming, pollution, and inequality are confronting, we believe it's time the media stopped shying away from these issues and became an active participant in finding solutions - and we hope you will join us. 
     
				 		 
	
	

As in many Asian countries, rubbish (especially polythene) is causing areas of natural beauty to become unsightly and is killing our land and sea animals. It was because of this observation in Sri Lanka that, in early July, a team of five young female students from Spain, Czech Republic, Netherlands and Germany decided to tackle the issue of plastic waste. They focused on Mount Lavinia Beach, one of the busiest beaches due to its close proximity to Colombo. Here for only a short time, they dedicated their time in Sri Lanka in educating the local community about how to keep the beach clean. The project began with the creation of a 30-minute presentation for the local residents explaining why plastic pollution is such a threat to the environment. Included in the presentation were videos to show the community (including the children) how plastic affects the animals (by swallowing plastic bags or getting straws lodged in their body) and humans (people who eat seafood are consuming plastic secondhand due to the amount of plastic microparticles in seafood). Scientists believe that by 2050, there will be more plastic in the ocean than fish. Mirror For Hope spoke to one of the team, Tessia Kammerer about their work in Sri Lanka and what their focus was. Beach clean-ups were just a part of our work - another main focus of our work was on education. We went to several schools to teach them about plastic pollution and the 6 Rs of Sustainability (Reuse, Reduce, Recycle, Rethink, Refuse, Repair). We explained to the women as well on why you cant burn plastic (they release toxic chemicals into the air) and why they shouldnt throw their garbage on the beach. We made an illustrated book which tells a story about plastic for kids and gave it out to orphanages and schools. We bought trash bins for the beach in Mount Lavinia and made sign boards which read keep our beach clean in Sinhalese and English, and placed them next to the bins. We also painted a class room and two walls which are visible from the train with encouraging slogans to keep the beach clean.
The students have already left Sri Lanka but they are hopeful that other communities can follow the example theyve started in Mount Lavinia. After the initial education and setup of garbage bins, all that is required is for someone in the community to collect the garbage from the trash bins on the beach and take it to the collection point for the government service, to dispose of. We asked Tessia how more locals and expats can get involved in a project at their local coastal area (or any area that has a garbage problem!). As were no longer in Sri Lanka, its up to you, the reader. You can always do a clean-up and you dont need to organize much to do it! All you need is a garbage bag and to identify the correct place to leave the trash. We just started collecting the plastic and trust me people will join you. During every clean-up we had a lot of people (locals and travellers) and kids join us, and they had a lot of fun trying to see who could pick up the most amount of plastic. You just need to show the kids what to collect (plastic) and what they can leave (organic garbage like leaves and coconut shells) and then theyll run over the beach like tornados!.
For women as young as this to be tackling such a big problem such as waste management in a country they dont live in, without receiving any funding is highly commendable and hopefully, the Mount Lavinia beach will stay clean thanks to all their hard work with this project.

Introducing a state-of-the-art fuel dispensing system to busy motorists using the Southern Expressway, Litro Fuels, a brand of Litro Gas Lanka commissioned their first ever fuel stations on either sides of the Welipanna entrance recently. The two fuel stations which incidentally become the first ever fuel stations along the Southern Expressway comprise fuel dispensers that utilize an automated multi-product fuel delivery system with electronic receipt generation to ensure a reliable service to customers. The two fuel stations are positioned with adequate space and specifications conforming to international standards.
The fuel dispensers will dispense all four varieties of Ceylon Petroleum Corporation fuel namely - Lanka Petrol 92, 95 Octane, Lanka Auto Diesel and Super Diesel. In addition, the fuel stations are equipped to provide facilities such as tyre top-ups (free of charge) and Nitrogen tyre filling service which particular service is capacitated to fill all four tyres simultaneously.
Motorists using the Southern Expressway have long felt the need for an accessible fuel station. Having realized this urgent requirement, we took measures to commission two fuel stations on either side of the Welipanna entrance to ensure accessibility and convenience. Moreover, our fuel delivery system is one of the most advanced automated features available in Sri Lanka. The real-time monitoring and electronic receipt systems embedded into this system guarantees service excellence that is on par with international standards. We as a truly Sri Lankan Company are pleased to be part of the countrys path to progress that incorporates cutting edge technology, commented Mr.Muditha Peiris  Managing Director, Litro Gas Lanka Ltd & Litro Gas Terminal Lanka (Pvt) Ltd
The Southern Expressway, Sri Lankas first E-class highway was declared open in November 2011 and it was extended up to Matara in 2014 covering over a stretch of 130 Kilometers. However, thus far the expressway continued to operate without a functioning fuel station along its length and breadth.
With the commissioning of the two fuel stations, Litro Fuels offers a much needed service to motorists further enhancing their service quality by virtue of bringing in world class technology and service delivery.
Litro Fuels plans to commission similar systems at convenient locations across the island in future.

MPs salary increment unfair at this stage: JO
	
Referring to the Governments decision to increase the salaries of MPs, the JO said today it was unfair to increase the salaries at this juncture, when people were crushed with undue taxes imposed on them.
It was reported that the salaries of all Parliamentarians were to be increased by approximately 215 per cent to be on par with the recent salary increase given to Judges.
The need to increase salaries had come up for discussion at the party leaders meeting held on July 17.
Accordingly, the salary of an MP would be increased from Rs.54, 285 to Rs.120, 000 while the salary of a Deputy Minister goes up from Rs.63, 500 to 135, 000 while the salary of a Minister and a State Minister would be increased from Rs.65, 000 to Rs.140, 000.
Addressing a news briefing, JO MP Shehan Semasinghe said it would be another attempt of the Government to divert the attention of people from the prevailing crisis in the country.
We will come to a unanimous decision after discussing the matter with JO party leaders. However, the JO is in a position to say that it was unfair to do so. Hence, JO would raise its voice on this matter in the next Parliamentary sitting, the MP said. (Sheain Fernandopulle)

only UNP organizations can ascertain the most popular candidate for Presidential Polls - Vasantha Se
	
The country is virtually in an election mood. The representatives of the main political forces talk about the presidential elections and their candidates. Against this backdrop, State Minister of Foreign Affairs Vasantha Senanayake in an interview with Daily Mirror, shares his views on the candidate to be fielded by the United National Party (UNP).He is also critical of the foreign policy of the government.
The excerpts:-

Q Recently, at a political event in Polonnaruwa, you made a point that the UNP should field a new candidate at the next presidential election to be conducted at the end of next year. What did you really mean
My idea is that the most popular UNP candidate should be fielded. Only the UNP organizations can ascertain the most suitable candidate. These organizations could determine who the most popular candidate is for the presidential election and he should be the one to contest the polls. 

QWhat is the reason for you to come out with such remarks at this stage in particular
I did it because I was asked by my constituents during the meetings I had with them in villages, who the candidate would be. I gave my views on the candidate. I did not mention any particular candidate. I said it should be the most popular candidate at that time. That candidate could even be the Prime Minister if he becomes the most popular candidate by that time. Yet, this should be ascertained by discussing with the general party membership. 

My Cabinet Minister never consults or invites me for any meeting

QWhat is your assessment on the political situation in the country and the strength of your party
I think the party has suffered a serious setback after the defeat at the local government elections. It is not a setback that we cannot recover from. We can certainly overcome the setback if we act intelligently. 

QYou talked about the new candidate. What do you think about the UNPs policies
I think there is a shift towards rural development. That is to take the development process to village level compared to the previous years. I think that is an improvement. 

QHow do you see the liberal economic policies which the UNP advocates
Liberal economic policies are a very good move. There has to be a structure of socialism to protect people as well in that liberal structure. 

QIs it missing in the present setup
I think there has to be a mixture of capitalism with socialist principles to protect the people.

The State should have always been secular

QWhat is your position on the present policies of the UNP on the ethnic issue
I think the government -- not the party -- has to be a little more proactive with regard to protecting minority rights and solving their issues. Particularly after the war was over, in the areas affected by the war, there is feeling that the government has forgotten them to some extent. I think the statement by MP Wijayakala Maheswaran reflects that a bit, although I do not agree with the remarks. The government should do a little more to protect the rights of those people. Then, they feel that they are secured. 

QWhat is your position on the character of the Constitution, especially in reference to the foremost place accorded to Buddhism
In my view, the country should always be secular. However, it has been giving the foremost place to Buddhism and protecting it. Now, it has been incorporated into the Constitution. There is no way that we should try to reverse it. If we do so, we would be seen as anti-Buddhist and unpatriotic. So, we cannot reverse the position of Buddhism in the Constitution now. But in a secular state, Buddhism should be protected, nurtured and given foremost place by the government. 

QYou are among the very first MPs to defect from the previous rule to support President Maithripala Sirisena as the common candidate. Today, the political forces that you were instrumental in defeating have raised their heads again. They won the local government elections. How do you assess that phenomenon
They won not because of any farsightedness or due to anything significant they did. They won because of our own mistakes. We did not perform well as we should have, during the past few years. 

Co-sponsoring UNHRC Resolution is not a good thing

QIn what areas
In every area! 

QCan you elaborate
In the economic areas, international relations, agriculture and every other sector, we did not do well. Still, we are sending mixed messages via the President and the Prime Minister. 

QYour great grandfather pioneered the agriculture development in the country through the colonization schemes. What is your policy on the agriculture sector development
First of all, we must have a policy on water. We have to adopt more effective ways to conserve water. Water is one of the most wasted resources in our country. Also, we have to have a policy in place on pesticides and chemicals. There should be a consistent policy which does not change after every little protest. We have to adopt a policy to determine whether we are using organic fertilizer or going to ban certain chemical substances. 
Then, we can go back to the older models of irrigation built by the ancient kings of Sri Lanka. We have abandoned that. We are using the tanks built by them, but we have forgotten the cascade system of water filtering that existed in ancient Sri Lanka. That system kept out the silt. One of the biggest problems is the silting of tanks. 

QYou are the State Minister of Foreign Affairs and you have mentioned the government did not do well in international relations. How did it happen
I think we have inconsistent policies. They change very frequently. For foreign policy, you must adopt long term policies, preferably national policies. In this regard, we can take a leaf from Indias book. Whichever the government that keep changing in India, they carry out one foreign policy. Here, it is not, when the governments keep changing. Even inside this government, it tends to fluctuate when the ministers change. We have to have a central policy. We should not be inclined too much towards any power bloc. But, we must get the support of everyone. 

QThere is perception in the country that the present government is bent on the West when it comes to the foreign policy. Do you agree
Yes, it does look that way. 

QHow do you specify your answer
Of course, the West must be our friend. We must have friendly relationship with the West. Likewise, links with traditional allies such as China, Russia and India are also important. It is also important to have links with up and coming associations such as ASEAN and the countries like Australia. Also, we have to look at new markets such as Africa and Latin America. We have to be more global in our approach without antagonizing anyone. 

QActually, the previous government did some work in this regard. What are your views on it
The previous government was pro-China. May be, they were a bit pro-Russia as well. Yet, they antagonized the West. That was also not a good policy. It should have been more balanced and neutral.

There was no compulsion

QWhat is your position on the governments decision to co-sponsor the UNHRC resolution on Sri Lanka in 2015
I personally think it was not a good thing to do. 

QWhy do you say so
If you read some of the matters stipulated like the provision for foreign Judges, these are not the things that should be included in the resolution at all. There was no compulsion for us to co-sponsor. But, we voluntarily went and did it. If we were going to co-sponsor, we should have read the document better and negotiated for reasonable terms. Some of the things we have signed up are politically suicidal. We need constitutional changes to do some of the things. How can you change the constitution without holding a majority in Parliament 

QHave you raised your voice in the government in this regard
Sometimes I only hear my voice and should shut up. There is a limit to what extent one person could raise the voice. 

QHow is your relationship with your Cabinet Minister of Foreign Affairs
He does not consult me on anything. He does not invite me for any meeting. He has refused to gazette my functions as the State Minister. It has been given to all the other State Ministers except for me. I bear no grudge. I hope he, as a learned man, would be more sensible. 

QThere is a perception that this government has antagonized China at the beginning by suspending the port city project. How do you view the governments relations with China
It has got better now. Relationship with China is getting better. We should be good friends with China just as much as we should be with the United States. We should not lean more towards one side. Also, we should have very good relationship with our neighbour, India. It is paramount. 

QAhead of the No-confidence motion, you took a certain stand. During the voting, you took another stand. What is the reason for that change of mind
That is the stand I had always taken. That was the need for reforms. 

QYou supported the Prime Minister eventually...
That was because he promised to bring in changes. 

QWhat do you think of the progress made so far
The other MPs are not talking. I think they are happy with the changes. I am not all that happy with the changes. I think more changes should have been made. Since my voice is not recognised, I have to respect the view of the majority. 

QWhat are the changes that you had expected
I think all the office bearers in the party should be chosen through a poll. 

QIncluding the leader...
Everyone. That is what democracy is. 

QSince this is the party which was founded by your great grandfather, do you think you have a right to stake a claim for it
I do not say that I have any right just because my great grandfather founded it. Of course, I have a sentimental attachment towards the party. 

QHas the UNP made a departure from the founding principles of it
Yes, it has departed radically, and it continues to do so. 

QIn what areas
To start off, I think it is democratic principles. The agriculture policy has changed. The view on foreign relations is not the same. There were significant changes. 

QYou were with the previous government and defected later. Would you do the same to the incumbent government in case your voice is not recognized
I will try my best to stay in the party, demand and shout for changes. Defecting can only happen if the situation becomes absolutely hopeless. I do not think the situation has degenerated to that as yet. 

It is true that Govt. is leaning towards the West in foreign policy
QYou represent Polonnaruwa. That is the electorate that is being represented by President Sirisena. How do you cooperate with him in development activities
It is difficult. He is the President and not in Polonnaruwa most of the time. I have to deal with his officials and representatives. On many occasions, they are not very cooperative. 

QThe UNP came third in Polonnaruwa at the local government elections. What was the reason
President Sirisena was the reason. UNPers too voted for him. He couldnt get votes from SLFP.

QHow could he get votes from the UNPers being the SLFP leader
All the development works are implemented by him in Polonnaruwa. The UNP doesnt have a Cabinet Minister in Polonnaruwa to counter even half of what he has done.

Opinions wrapped in saffron robes
	
Did Ven. Athureliye Rathana Thera take a wise decision to vacate the post of presidential adviser

Those country leaders who apposed the views of Buddhist monks or ignored their presence soon learned from their mistakes
	
	But what must be taken note of is that these monks functioned in their roles in worldly affairs in an unofficial capacity
	
	From the times of the British occupying Sri Lanka, monks clad in saffron robes have had a presence in almost all the struggles

Monks have played pivotal roles in shaping the political face of Sri Lanka. From the times of the great kings to the many prime ministers and presidents who ruled this island, the opinion, more than the advice, of the Buddhist clergy has carried weight. 
Those country leaders who apposed the views of Buddhist monks or ignored their presence soon learned from their mistakes. One such leader was the late Ranasinghe Premadasa who initially ignored Ven Galboda Gnanissara Thera (fondly known as Podi Hamuduruwo) when he landed himself in the presidents seat. 
When Premadasa observed that things werent going too well regarding his political work in Colombo the president forged important ties with the priest and temple. 
One monk who has gone public with the displeasure he harbours because his views werent sought by the head of state is Ven. Athureliye Rathana Thera. The monk has conveyed that he no longer wishes to hold this post because he was never made use of in his capacity as presidential adviser. The monk is reported to have made this statement at the recent 30th Anniversary celebrations of the Sri Lanka Womens Development Cooperative Society in Colombo. 

The Late Ven Sobitha Thera

This islands history reveals that a monks role was never restricted to the temple. From the times of the British occupying Sri Lanka, monks clad in saffron robes have had a presence in almost all the struggles which were carried out to build a better and safer nation. But what must be taken note of is that these monks functioned in their roles in worldly affairs in an unofficial capacity. 

The monk must now start thinking whether his worldly views gowell with the Yahapalana Government, which only wishes to work on its own ideas. This is despite seasoned politicians warning about where this Government is heading

Ven. Athureliye Rathana Thera was appointed officially to be the presidents adviser. Does all this indicate that the unofficial system works better for monks in Sri Lanka because the priests who functioned this way were powerful and got many tasks accomplished One such priest who wielded much power was Ven. Seelankara Thera of Dimbulagala whose work was patronised by President Ranasinghe. 
We also had firebrand monk Ven. Sobitha Thera who played a key role in the National Movement for a Just Society which toppled the dictatorial Government headed by Mahinda Rajapaksa, in 2015. The late monk, who possessed a degree in history from the Vidyodaya University, was renowned for his oratory skills and most importantly for the change he made in society through his non-violent movement. 
But before the National Movement for a Just Society kicked off the ground, the Rajapaksa Government allowed a monk in the name of Ven. Galagoda Aththe Gnanasara to cause racial tension in the island through his activities. It was alleged that former Defence Secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa was backing this monk to the hilt. Gotabaya has denied this claim repeatedly. This monk claimed that he was on a mission to keep a check on the work of Muslim extremists, Christian fundamentalists and many unauthorised constructions that existed close to Buddhist temples. What worried people was how the monk wielded so much power, in an unofficial capacity, when there is a law and a police force operating in the country. 
This monk then was functioning as the Secretary of the Bodu Bala Sena, but thats besides the point because according to the rules on discipline stipulated in the Buddhist order for monks, there is no provision for monks to engage in politics; a fact which questions Ve, Gnanasaras journey in robes because he was a candidate for the Jathika Hela Urumaya at the 2014Parliamentary Elections.

Monks have always preferred their unofficial roles in politics.Even at present politicians in the Government and the opposition make quick visits to the temples of of the Malwatte and Asgiriya Chapters when they get fresh appointments in ministries.

Monks have always preferred their unofficial roles in politics. Even at present politicians in the Government and the opposition make quick visits to the temples of Most Ven. Thibbotuwawe Sri Siddartha Sumangala Thera of the Malwatte Chapter and Ven. Warakagoda Gnarathna Thera of the Asgiriya Chapter when they get fresh appointments in ministries. This is because they need the blessings and approval of the clergy for their work. 

Ven. Galagoda Aththe Gnanasara Thera

Ven. Athureliye Rathana Thera has impressed many with his views on economic matters. He very recently aired his views on the use of Glyphosate in Sri Lanka. The monk has called for an internationally accepted legal document to be formulated for the regulation of Glyphosate. This is a monk who could have been one of those rare members of the Buddhist clergy whose views were sought by the law makers while functioning in an official capacity. This didnt happen. The monk must now start thinking whether his worldly views go well with the Yahapalana Government, which only wishes to work on its own ideas. This is despite seasoned politicians warning about where this Government is heading.

Ven. Rathana Thera must understand that monks have taken to entering parliament as the best option to air their views. He has also made an impact on the political platforms which feature representatives of Jathika Hela Urumaya. But it seems that the hierarchy in the Yahapalana Government dont fancy what the priest can bring to the table at political discussions. It seems a wise move by this monk disembark from this Yahapalana Ship which is right now looking into the Abyss.

Opposition Leaders Post: Speaker to consult UPFA
	
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya today said he had decided to consult UPFA General Secretary Mahinda Amaraweera to get his opinion on appointing Joint Opposition Parliamentary Group Leader Dinesh Gunawardane as the Leader of Opposition.
The Speaker in a statement said he had received a letter signed by eight members from the joint opposition requesting him to appoint Mr. Gunawardene as the Leader of the Opposition as he had the support of 70 members in the opposition benches.
These 70 members are ones who had been elected to Parliament from the UPFA. Therefore the speaker is duty bound to ask for the official opinion of the UPFA with regard to the matter. Accordingly I have decided to seek the opinion of UPFA General Secretary Mahinda Amaraweera on the matter, the Speaker said in a statement.
The current Leader of Opposition is the Tamil National Alliance (TNA) Parliamentary Group Leader R Sampanthan. TNA Spokesman Member of Parliament M. A Sumanthiran who commented on the matter said Mr. Gunawardanene and the Joint Opposition Group members are the ones who were elected from UPFA which is an ally of the government. If Mr. Gunawardene is claiming the post of Opposition Leader he and the others will have to give up the membership of UPFA, Mr. Sumanthiran said.
Meanwhile the 16 member SLFP group in the opposition is also expected to back Mr. Gunawardene as the Opposition Leader. Member of this group MP Dayasiri Jayasekera said his group has no objection in appointing Mr. Gunawardene as the Leader of Opposition. Current Opposition Leader Mr. Sampanthan is only talking of the issues faced by the people in the North while keeping silent on other national issues. We want an opposition Leader who takes up issues faced by people all over the country, he said.(Yohan Perera)

Pope Francis declares death penalty inadmissible in all cases
	
Pope Francis has changed the teachings of the Catholic faith to oppose the death penalty in all circumstances, the Vatican has said.
The Catechism of the Church, which sums up the teachings, had previously stated that the death penalty could be used in some cases.
It now says it is "inadmissible because it is an attack on the inviolability and dignity of the person".
Pope Francis has in the past spoken out against executions.
Last October, he had said the Church's policy on the death penalty was one area where teaching was not static and could change with modern concerns.
The text of the catechism was first set by Pope John Paul II in October 1992.
The teachings had earlier stated that the death penalty was "an appropriate response to the gravity of certain crimes and an acceptable, albeit extreme, means of safeguarding the common good".
However, the new text says there is "an increasing awareness that the dignity of the person is not lost even after the commission of very serious crimes".
It also argues that today's more effective detention methods protect citizens and "do not definitively deprive the guilty of the possibility of redemption".
The Church will now work with determination for the abolition of the death penalty worldwide, a statement from the Holy See said.
Historically, the Church has mostly been unopposed to the death penalty, including into the 20th Century. In 1952, Pope Pius XII said it was not a violation of the universal right to life.
Pope John Paul II argued for imprisonment over execution wherever possible, although Joseph Ratzinger, who later became Pope Benedict XVI, wrote that the death penalty could be permissible. (BBC)

## Title: Revisiting The Village in the Jungle

Revisiting The Village in the Jungle
	
In the West, Leonard Woolf is celebrated as a political theorist, publisher, anti-imperialist, socialist, and of course, the husband to the far more popular Virginia Woolf. In Sri Lanka, he is celebrated for The Village in the Jungle, which has become something of a sacrosanct text in the eyes of our literati, so much so that any attempt made at reinterpreting it, in whatever form or media, is eventually criticised. 
Lester James Peries discovered this for himself when his adaptation, warmly received in Europe, was castigated and virtually torn to pieces by representatives of the English Department here. It seems impossible therefore to assess a work like Village without assessing the time in which it was set, but two schools of thought have analysed the novel from two completely different standpoints. Before delving into that, however, let me offer my own thoughts on the novel, the author, and the politics behind both. 
The Village in the Jungle was published in 1913, right before the First World War would break out. It predicted and preceded the period for which Woolf would best be known in the West, as the co-founder of the Hogarth Press, which introduced the works of the Bloomsbury Group as well as translations of Freud and Dostoyevsky to British society. When it first appeared, however, the novel did not make much of an impact on that society. Indeed, it was sidelined in favour of Woolfs other works to such an extent that upon his death, his obituary did not even mention that he had written such a novel. All this merely adds to the belief, held by several Sri Lankan scholars, that Village was a milestone in English literature, because no other Englishman abroad, in the colonies, had authored such a work before. To assess this aspect of The Village in the Jungle in detail, it is necessary to compare it with E. M. Forsters Passage to India. 

When it first appeared, however, the novel did not make much of an impact on that society. Indeed, it was sidelined in favour of Woolfs other works to such an extent that upon his death, his obituary did not even mention that he had written such a novel. All this merely adds to the belief

A Passage to India became over the decades a prescribed text for students of English literature, and it is prescribed in our schools and universities alongside Woolfs novel. What distinguishes Woolf from Forster, however, is that the former was convinced that while British society was corrupting Indian society, the only salvation for Indians was the liberalism of Forsters prototype in the novel, Mr Fielding. The rift between Fielding and the protagonist, Azeez, accelerates towards the end to such an extent that, in the final paragraph, the belittled Indian declares openly that only when the British leaves Indias shores will the two be able to become friends again. It is clear that while Forster accepted Azeezs cynicism, he was also more accommodative of Fieldings liberalism. And that was it: there was no attempt at bridging the rift, only at pointing out its inevitability in the face of hardening attitudes in both coloniser and enslaved. 
Woolf was not a liberal in the conventional sense of that term. His experience as an outsider in his home country (being a Jew, married to a woman who had entertained anti-Semitic thoughts) would have convinced him that liberalism alone would not have done. The Village in the Jungle, in that sense, is an almost unconditional indictment on British society, on what it had done to Sri Lankan society. Forster does suggest that colonialism must be eradicated (after all Azeez is his protagonist), but he tempers it by implying that the route to be taken by those agitating for independence must be from imperialism to quasi-dependency, corresponding to a shift from Crown Colony to Dominion. When Fielding taunts Azeez by contending that Indians cannot govern themselves (India a nation! What an apotheosis! Last corner to the drab nineteenth-century sisterhood! Waddling in at this hour of the world to take her seat! She, whose only peer was the Holy Roman Empire, she shall rank with Guatemala and Belgium perhaps!), he is qualifying his sympathies with the Indian independence movement, which at the time of the publication of Passage was gaining strength. 
It is an irony of fate that this route, from Dependency to Dominion, would come about, not in India, but in Sri Lanka, mainly on account of the fact that we did not have the kind of nationalist bourgeoisie which India had. India a nation! - hidden beneath the veneer of mockery there was the assumption that British civilization, despite its destructive character, was nevertheless the only civilization that could keep colonial societies from deteriorating into self-destruction. Forsters great achievement in A Passage to India was his portrait of the English in their Crown Colony: drab, dreary, conventional, and at the end of the day, bigoted. In Mrs Moore he finds the ideal symbol for oneness and unity, and in Adela Quested he finds the ideal symbol for the transformation from love to condescension to hate with respect to the natives. But Forsters biggest weakness was his inability to overcome the oneness of Mrs Moores vision, the unity and the holism which finds its antithesis in the Marabar Caves. The echo that Adela hears in the Caves is an echo that, as Regi Siriwardena once noted, was nothing more than a contrivance which inflates the novel with a portentous hint of profundities. As with Fieldings liberal sympathies, so too then with Mrs Moores belief in oneness and Adelas despair at not recognising that echo. 
A Passage to India is a definitive novel of the 1920s (it was published in 1924). This was the decade of Sons and Lovers, Women in Love, Mrs Dalloway, and To the Lighthouse, which resorted to expressing despair as an act of liberation. It is despair and meaninglessness, therefore, that colours much of the plot in Passage, and where it coincides with Forsters liberalism, the novel is at its weakest. There is nothing really concrete in the book. On the contrary, it stops short of a complete condemnation of the British system and instead ponders on the possibility of reconciliation between the two cultures - coloniser and enslaved - as a means of liberation for India. This sort of romanticism and moderation was better vented out, as I suggested before, in Sri Lankan society, and it needed for its success the absence of a nationalist bourgeoisie, the bourgeoisie which in India had prevented Azeez from embracing Fielding. 
Just as there is nothing really concrete in Passage, there is nothing really abstract in Village. The only attempt at depicting abstractions in Woolfs novel is the sequence of the pilgrimage to Beragama, and even there the sense of mysticism, so pervasive in Forsters India, is tempered by the possibility that it is nothing more than a convenient deception. That Woolf understood this aspect of Sinhalese society, during his tenure in Hambantota, thus did not prevent him from indicting not just the colonial system, but also the myths and legends that had prevented the Sinhalese from transcending their own exploitative structures.

The British made use of those structures, particularly those relating to power relations between village elders and common folk, to tighten their grip. Consequently, there is no effort by Woolf to romanticise feudal society or the structures of power which had made up that society before the advent of the British

The British made use of those structures, particularly those relating to power relations between village elders and common folk, to tighten their grip. Consequently, there is no effort by Woolf to romanticise feudal society or the structures of power which had made up that society before the advent of the British.
However, at the same time, he did not turn his critique of feudal insularity into an excuse to celebrate British openness and liberalism. On the contrary, he seems to have inferred a link, rather than an opposition, between those two. As such he avoided the pitfall that Forster led himself to in Passage: critiquing the Empire without really delving into the processes that had facilitated the continuation of that Empire in the first place. Forster was a liberal cosmopolitan entranced by the myth of oneness and wholeness in Oriental society; Woolf was a realist who preferred neither of them. 
What Woolf did not miss out was the fact that the rural savagery that horrified the liberal was the result of that same British presence. Consequently, he finds in both the grip of the colonial judicial system and the hegemony of Babehami and Fernando the two faces of British imperialism: exploitative, and rife with opportunity for the poor to be robbed and the rich to escape scot-free. This does not mean that Woolf was flawless, and in a later piece, I will explore what is missing in Village. For now, however, I am done.

Salaries of ministers likely to be increased
	
Salaries of ministers, deputy ministers, state ministers and all parliamentarians are likely to be increased by approximately 215 per cent to be on par with the recent salary increase given to judges, parliament sources said yesterday.
The need to increase salaries had come up for discussion at the party leaders meeting held on July 17 attended by JVP Leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake, Joint Opposition Parliament Group Leader Dinesh Gunawardane, UPFA Leader Nimal Siripala De Silva, Leader of the House Lakshman Kiriella and TNA MP A. Sumanthiran.
The sources said the salary increment would be effective from January this year and that it would be paid this month with the arrears.
Accordingly, the salary of an MP would increase from Rs.54, 285 to Rs.120, 000 while the salary of a deputy minister goes up from Rs.63, 500 to 135, 000 while the salary of a minister and a state minister would be increased from Rs.65, 000 to Rs.140, 000. (Sujith Hewajulige)

The spectre of  The Outsider  in a Presidential Election
	
A little over a year ago when I announced that I would be contesting the next Presidential Election, some people laughed, some took it seriously and many, including those who know me, were confused. 
Are you serious was a common question. My response was simple: when I think about all those who were serious about contesting, including the winners, when I think about their track records and what they actually did after the particular election, I am wary of using the word serious. 
A good friend, after speaking with me on the subject for about half an hour, said I am not sure if you are serious or not! I responded, neither am I. We both laughed. Lets leave my presidential ambitions and their seriousness aside. Its not important. Lets talk instead of the outsider-phenomenon. 
Outsider can be understood in many ways. Maithripala was an outsider to the party machinery that backed his campaign in 2015. Sarath Fonseka was an outsider in that he was not a politician when he decided to take on Mahinda Rajapaksa in 2010. Mahinda Rajapaksa was treated like an outsider by the leader of his party in 2005. Chandrika Kumaratunga was an outsider to the SLFP not too long before that party decided to back her candidacy in 1994. Ranasinghe Premadasa was an outsider to the UNPs inner circle despite the positions he held in that party; support was offered grudgingly. 
In other words being an outsider doesnt necessarily mean that the odds are stacked against you. However, whats common about the above personalities is that they were all placed in the driving seat of a big vehicle, i.e. either the UNP or the SLFP or coalitions led by one of these two parties. Those who drove smaller vehicles were non-factors; they couldnt prevent eventual winners from getting the 50%+1, an eventuality that would have required consideration of the second preference. 
There are names doing the rounds. From the major parties there is Ranil Wickremesinghe (UNP) and Maithripala Sirisena (SLFP). The latters chances hinge on a replay of 2015 and this under severely reduced circumstances. The Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) has not announced a candidate, but it seems likely that Gotabhaya Rajapaksa would be the choice of that party. Gotabhaya is an outsider but less so than Fonseka was. Patali Champika Ranawaka is spoken of as a possible UNP candidate in the event that Wickremesinghe declines on account of probable defeat. 
Then there are the total outsiders (as of now). Nagananda Kodituwakku and Rohan Pallewatte have already announced that they would contest, the latter registering a party and hiring an advertising firm to do brand positioning (for now). Kumar Sangakkaras name has come up but he hasnt said yes or no (so far). Then there is Halpage Madhusanka Nuwan (Madhu Roxz) claims on his Facebook account that he is an actor, singer, lyricist, music producer and film maker. Madhu Roxz has also announced. 
This morning a young man named Ravisha Thilakawardana posted a status update on Facebook that has generated a lot of comments. This is what he said: If you want to take revenge on anyone, all you need to do is say that the person is going to take on Gotabhaya Rajapaksa at the next presidential election; immediately that person would be ridiculed before the entire country by bayyas (roughly, Rajapaksa supporters) who would sling mud beginning from the time the person defecated in the pants in the kindergarten. 

people are now getting sick of same old, same old. Sure theyll vote for the candidate put forward by the major parties if thats all the choice they have

Someone made a post to the effect that the UNPs Working Committee has decided to nominate Ravisha to represent the liberal camp headed by the UNP at the next presidential election. This prompted many posts supporting Ravisha. There were congratulatory messages, expression of support and some neat campaign visuals of the man. 
As someone said, the success of Maithripala Sirisena has made any idiot think that he/she can become President. It also seems that the anti-Rajapaksa camp is stumped; they simply cant find a candidate who has a reasonable chance of defeating Gotabhaya Rajapaksa  hence the Kumar Sangakkara Option. Whether Pallewattes campaign ends up with him being the choice, we do not know. As of now, he is indicating (like Kodituwakku) that he wants to steer clear of the two major political parties and/or the coalitions led by them. Madhu Roxz echoes these sentiments. 
While part of all this is pure fun and part of it is clever media work to test waters as well as throwing off balance the perceived political other, some of it is dead serious. Just because those who didnt get into a big vehicle failed, theres nothing to say that this would always be the case. The rise of outsiders in other parts of the world have made many believe that such a phenomenon is not impossible in Sri Lanka. Those who for whatever reason back the major parties have already started asking well, can he win which implies that the particular he is not unsuitable. The counter question is also being asked: shouldnt we be thinking more about whether someone is suitable, rather than focusing on whether a person can win After all the winnability-factor hasnt exactly delivered a civilized, democratic country where the fundamentals of good governance (yahapalanaya) have been consecrated. 
What all this indicates to me is that people are now getting sick of same old, same old. Sure theyll vote for the candidate put forward by the major parties if thats all the choice they have. Many will no doubt let winnability and worse evils frame thinking when it comes to it. However, if anything was learned in the 2015 decision, it is that theres room for surprise. While on paper the SLPP seems poised to win, the very fact that the yahapalanists are in disarray means that an outsider can make a decent run. Whats crucial is for the outsider to remain outside. If theres momentum created then such a momentum-creator could be wooed by the anti-Rajapaksa camp. Then it boils down to a battle between personal glory and genuine need to turn things around. If the former is chosen, then we are at same old, same old, but if the particular person declines, there is that outside chance that his/her campaign will get an extra boost which could wreck the political equation. 
Once that happens, who knows There is palpable disgust at the two major parties (and I could describe the SLPP as more blue than any other colour, taking into consideration the recent political fortunes of the SLFP). So heres to Rohan Pallewatte, Nagananda Kodituwakku, Ravisha Thilakawardana and Madhu Roxz: steer clear of the UNP and SLFP/SLPP so we can hope that a different future can be charted for our nation.

This Govt. is a  bad advertisement for democracy
	

The latest by the Railway trade unions is a classic case of blackmail
	
	The problem with this Government is that it neither has determination nor decisiveness to play the role of a catalyst in development

The role of the Government as a catalyst for social and economic modernisation of the state is as old as any notion of the Government. Though the academic interest in it was reawakened in the mid 80s with the publication of  Bring the State back in, the real go-getter states existed much before. And interestingly, the majority of them were authoritarian or quasi authoritarian. The founder of modern Turkey, Kemal Ataturk, rebuilt the disintegrated Ottoman empire into a modernist secular state, even while the overwhelming majority of its rural folks remained religious and backward. Their degenerating influence on the state that he feared more than any external enemy, so the modern Turkey was built on the back of a shadow state of a secular military,judiciary and press. 
Elsewhere, developmental dictators of Taiwan and South Korea transformed their states from near nothing to future technological powerhouses. Others, such as Mahathir Mohammed and Lee Kuan Yew, though held choreographic elections, were hardly democrats. 
In contrast, the track records of democracies in economic and social modernization have been abysmal. India remained a bad advertisement for democracy and colossally squandered opportunities that existed for its people during the first five decades of independence. The vast majority of developing world democracies are worse off today than their relative position vis-a-vis developed world at the time of their independence in the 1940, 50s and 60s. That they were victims of predatory elites and military juntas during some time in their independence worsened their miseries. However, subsequent elected government didnt perform any better.

Irrespective of white vans and 18th Amendment, Mahinda Rajapaksa would be remembered as the one who won the war and built highways 

Democracies incapacity to deliver rapid development is inbuilt in its structure. Democracy is a slow consultative process involving too many stakeholders with competing interests. Existential conditions of polarisation often make a compromise is painstakingly slow, if ever. The advocates of democracy have often overlooked the fact that for a society to develop cooperative behaviour it also has to reach a certain threshold of shared interests, which are often undermined by a plethora of competing interests and political affiliations, aggravated by low economic and social conditions of their respective societies. Developing states nonetheless have immediate economic and social priorities which can not be overlooked and in order to address them, a state needs a strong government.
After all, that is why executive the presidency was introduced in this country. 

Developing world democracies
That may also explain why whenever a developing world democracy records an impressive growth that had happened under a renegotiated social contract between the government and the society, under which, a pro-growth government has staked claims for a greater control of the trajectory of the state and society. Take for instance, the two Governments that had made a significant contribution to the economy in Sri Lanka; the first few years of J. R Jayewardene Administration and the two term presidency of Mahinda Rajapaksa. Both were quasi authoritarian and confronted the social dissent and competing vested interests through the recourse of their own constitutional and unconstitutional means, be it sacking July strikers in en messes, banning the political left or operating white vans. 
Similarity could be seen in India, where the pro-business prime minister Narendra Modi is more in the mould of Mahathir Mohammed, than of type of his slow- moving procrastinating predecessors of Nehru-Gandhian variety. Parallels could also be seen in Bangladesh, where Prime Minister Sheik Hasina has overseen an economic revival. They are also power maximisers in their own ways. However, their countries are not Sweden or Denmark. The developing world is poor and disorganised not just because of resource scarcity, but also because their societies are less enlightened in a modernist sense. Rather than being guided by these societies, a forward looking government should guide them. That is however untenable without the government having sufficient autonomy over the society. 

The developing world is poor and disorganised not just because of resource scarcity, but also because their societies are less enlightened in a modernist sense. Rather than being guided by these societies, a forward looking government should guide them

Meagre growth
The problem with this Government is that it neither has determination nor decisiveness to play the role of a catalyst in development. Its contribution to the revival of democracy is not a supplement to its inability to forge ahead in economy. On any account, such democratic gains achieved in a low social and economic development have proved to be short lived. Four years since its election to power, and after much hype about an export led growth, export has grown only by meagre US $ 0.2 billion ( from US$ 11.1 billion in 2014 to 11.3 in 2017). FDI inflow has either stagnated or declined. Economic growth has hovered below 4 per cent for three consecutive years. 
And the Governments vacillation in the economic front is aggravated by its spinelessness, which has led to wild cat strikes. The latest by the Railway trade unions is a classic case of blackmail. And the myopic demands by the Railway unions for a relocation of a technological hub , Trace Expert City, is not just a case of competing interests, but a manifestation of backwardness of certain entities. It may be to drive a point that J.R. Jayewardene sacked strikers in drove or Thatcher responded with an iron fist. 

The founder of modern Turkey, KemalAtaturk, rebuilt the disintegrated Ottoman empire into a modernist secular state, even while the overwhelming majority of its rural folks remained religious and backward

A government that shies away from difficult economic and social decisions in favour of its political calculations does more harm to the nation than one that used white vans to silence its enemies. Such countries - Pinochets Chile, Chiang kai Sheks Taiwan, South Korea, etc, emerged as viable economic and democratic entities partly thanks to difficult decisions made in the past. Where as, those who pussyfooted and let the gutter impulses run the country, perpetuated the miserable status quo. 
Irrespective of white vans and 18th Amendment, Mahinda Rajapaksa would be remembered as the one who won the war and built highways. If this Government keeps vacillating on the economy, history would place Messrs. Ranil Wickremesinghe and Maithripala Sirisena on a long list of passengers who rode the gravy train down the precipice .

## Title: Tourism,  an asset to Sri Lanka

Tourism,  an asset to Sri Lanka
	
Much hype is created these days with respect to arrival of visitors from overseas to Sri Lanka, a paradise as mentioned by many departing visitors. Have we geared ourselves to meet the growing need of travel for visitors as well as locals who wish to explore the natural beauty of paradise. Modes of transport available for visitors are bicycles, motor cycles, three wheelers, cars, buses, trains, and by air.
Travel within the country is slow in Colombo, outside Colombo leave alone the places of interest. The travel speed within the country is less than 30 km/hr. Kandy approx 4 hrs, Auradhapura 5  6 hrs, East 7  8 hrs so on, the exception being Galle / Matara due to the availability of a freeway. Travel by expressway entrance at Kottawa, Panadura, Kaduwela, Kadawatha from Colombo can take 30  40 minutes.
There are many under-utilized air fields within the country controlled by the Air Force. Only a few are used for commercial purposes such as Ratmalana, Jaffna, Trincomalee, just to name three. The rest are well maintained by the Air Force but under utilized in domestic passenger air travel.
If the Government and the Ministry of Tourism is interested in developing facilities for visitors who waste much of their time in the country on the road at great risk to life and limb. Economical domestic air transport must be encouraged and is a must in the future.
There are air fields in the following areas which were developed by the British to facilitate their cover and rule within their empire such as Minneriya, Sigiriya, Iranamadu, Vayuniya, Puttalam, Anuradhapura, Batticoloa, Ampara, Hambantota, Weerawila, Koggala, Katukurunda a total of eleven Under Utilized Domestic Air Ports within the Country. Air Force itself can start a Domestic Air Service which can give Cadet Pilot Training opportunity for Flight Cadets of the Air Force. By this method the Air Force can get additional revenue to maintain the airfields
During the 2nd World War, Koggala Lake was used for flying boats such as Suderlands for transport of goods and Katalinas used in surveillance and Thunderbirds operated from Minneriya. Flight training was done from China Bay, Trincomalee, Ratmalana and Katunayake.

Travel within the country is slow in Colombo, outside Colombo leave alone the places of interest. The travel speed within the country is less than 30 km/hr. Kandy approx 4 hrs, Auradhapura 5  6 hrs, East 7  8 hrs so on, the exception being Galle / Matara due to the availability of a freeway. Travel by expressway entrance at Kottawa, Panadura, Kaduwela, Kadawatha from Colombo can take 30  40 minutes

There are many Inland Lakes, amphibious aircrafts can be used. Kandy, Nuwara Eliya can be serviced by amphibious aircraft. No need to build expensive airports as ventured out a few years back. Maldives runs the most profitable, efficient and largest amphibious aircraft fleet, of course outsourced to carriers.
In order to be competitive a Domestic Open Air Policy must be implemented. There are many Private Sector Air Transport Companies in operation. They must be encouraged to have daily shuttle service at competitive fares. The current air transport charges for domestic flights is exorbitant thus discouraging domestic air travel. If domestic air transport is available end to end travel time can be reduced from the current 4  8 hours to under one hour. An Air Ambulance Service too can be started if necessary from all parts of the country. Private sector and Air Force operate Helicopter Service but the rates per hour are exorbitant and not attractive for domestic tourist transport.
If the government considers investment in the Airports and Domestic Air Travel is expensive they can follow the model of England. UKs two biggest airports, Heathrow and Gatwick, Edinburgh, Bristol, Aberdeen and Belfast are majority owned by foreign investors following airports of India are managed on a PPP model. Indira Gandhi International Airport  Delhi, Chattrapati Shivaji International Airport  Mumbai, Rajiv Gandhi International Airport  Hyderabad, Kempegowda International Airport  Bengaluru, Cochin International Airport  Kochin. Around 1,000 Airports of USA are privately owned and managed.
Tourism can be one of the greatest assets of the country if infrastructure and rest room facilities at tourist attractions are improved.

VOICE OF PEOPLE
	
The Mirror For Hope asked some well-known faces about things that make them happy, or why the media should focus on positive news happening aroundthem :


Im glad that the has come forward to do this page. There has been a culture created to focus only on negative news, and this could make us a sick nation. I feel that theres a demand among people to listen to negative news. I see that a lot of irrelevant things are being reported through the media. We have a lot of positive stories happening around us but they dont get the necessary attention. By reporting positive news items it helps to stimulate people to do more good things. Kishu Gomes, Corporate Personality

A few things that keep me happy include spending time close to nature, visiting beautiful places in Sri Lanka and meeting new people and exploring new destinations, walking on the beach, working out/yoga, creating new things, brands and designs. I also like changing lives of both animals and people. Otara Gunewardene, Nature Lover, Entrepreneur and Founder ofPassion  Embark

Won't allow moves to increase MP's salaries: Mangala
	
Finance and Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera said he was not aware of a salary increase to Parliamentarians and Ministers and added he would not give his sanction to go ahead with the pay rise to them when it comes to the Treasury for approval.
Responding to the Daily Mirror at the news briefing held last afternoon at the Finance Ministry auditorium, Minister Samaraweera said he was against the increase of any sector in the public service under the prevailing situation in the country.
The question and answer at the news briefing ensued as follows.
Daily Mirror: You look happier after helping yourself for a salary increase to Parliamentarians and Ministers. Dont you
Minister Samaraweera: Not at all. Who said salaries have been increased for MPs and Ministers
Daily Mirror: There are media reports to that effect this morning.
Minister Samaraweera: Do you believe those false media reports If a salary increase is to be given it must come for the Treasury approval.
Daily Mirror: Are you saying that there is no move to increase salaries of MPs
Minister Samaraweera: I am not aware of such a move. Lets see after the proposal for salary increase comes to the Treasury.
Daily Mirror: Did the proposal come to the cabinet on this Tuesday
Minister Samaraweera: No. It did not come to the cabinet nor did we discuss a pay rise to MPs and Ministers.
Another journalist: Salaries of Parliamentarians and high judicial officers have been coupled and once there is a salary increase to top judicial officers, salaries of MPs and Ministers salaries must be simultaneously increased.
Minister Samaraweera:
Yes. That is correct. The salaries of Parliamentarians and top judicial officers were coupled in 2006. But this is not mandatory. There was a recent salary increase for judicial officers but the government has not increased salaries of MPs and Ministers up to now.(Sandun A Jayasekera)
