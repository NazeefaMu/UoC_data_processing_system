Acquiring NFTH: No agreement only letter of intent: GMOA
	
The GMOA said yesterday the Government had still not acquired the Neville Fernando Teaching Hospital (NFTH) on the basis that no agreement had been signed between the Health Ministry and SAITM with regard to its acquisition.
GMOA Secretary Haritha Aluthge told a news conference that SAITM, the Health Ministry and the Bank of Ceylon (BoC) had only signed a Letter of Intent by confirming their willingness to enter into a three-party agreement to be signed later.
According to the Letter of Intent provided by the Health Ministry Secretary on our request, the agreement will be signed subject to terms and conditions agreed by all three parties and on the approval of the Cabinet, he said.
Dr. Aluthge said it was evident that the government had still not acquired the NFTH and added that the Letter of Intent was not a legally binding agreement.
He said this proved that Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne had deceived the government including President Maithripala Sirisena.
A Commission similar to the Presidential Commission of Inquiry (PCoI) on the Bond issue should be set up to investigate this controversy involving Minister Senaratne, who is also attempting to mislead the judiciary, he added.
GMOA Assistant Secretary Naveen De Soyza said the time had now arrived for the minister to resign from his portfolio.
He said the GMOA had asked MP Ravi Karunanayake to resign from his portfolio in 2015 and it had happened in 2017.
We have been asking Minister Senaratne to resign since 2016 and should do so next year, Dr. De Soyza said. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)

'Illiterate' people making 'false' allegations against AGs Dept: ASG Kodagoda
	
Answering allegations levelled against the Attorney Generals Department as to how it examined 8,600 pages data retrieved from Arjun Aloysius mobile phone within two days, Additional Solicitor General Yasantha Kodagoda PC said yesterday some illiterate people were making baseless allegations, because in the retrieval process, the experts had converted the data to a PDF file and using its search engine the relevant details could be found easily.
In a special statement to the PCoI, ASG Kodagoda explained the process adopted by the experts in retrieving the data from Mr. Aloysius' mobile phone.
He said when transferring the extracted data to a computer using a particular medium by experts, the data is then converted to a searchable and conventional PDF document which contained 8,600 pages.
He said that process of extracting, converting and downloading was done within eight hours.
The ASG said subsequently that PDF was searched by both the experts and the Counsel of the Attorney Generals Department for the purpose of identifying certain details.
That is how 8,600 pages were scanned and details found within 48 hours. Not because I am a genius who could go through all those pages, obviously, illiterate people would think so, but literate people will know that it was done using the search engine of the PDF file, ASG Kodagoda said.
He said he was of the view that it was the method they had used in gathering certain details which were submitted in 26 pages to the Commission when Minister Ravi Karunanayake was testifying
When Justice Prasanna Jayawardena wanted to clarify the fact that whether the PDF file could be altered or changed at some point during the extraction process, ASG Kodagoda said the PDF that was received by them was an uneditable document.
Kodagoda cant fabricate messages in Aloysius phone, and that has to be clarified, because some illiterate people are making false allegations, which only reflects the level of their literacy, the ASG said.
When Justice Jayawardena said the Commission was not concerned about such outside comments, the ASG said, No those comments matter because we are here to assist the commission only.
ASG Kodagoda was of the view that it was about safeguarding his professional reputation from illiterate comments.
Senior Counsel Chanaka de Silva appearing for Arjun Mahendran said those submissions might or might not have been made elsewhere, hence, there was no necessity to be dealing with them at the commission.
The ASG however disagreeing with the counsels stance said he needed to be concerned about such comments because the Commission is the only forum in which he has to speak.
However, he also told the Commission that the method used in retrieving data from mobile phones would not be used for the laptops and computers because it was impossible to do so.
The ASG said there would be a cloned copy (copy of every data) stored in the hardware of such laptop devices after the extraction and therefore it would not allow to have a single PDF file of the material extracted from them.
He said they would have a mirror image of that cloned copy of the hardware for the investigations and they would do whatever was possible to retrieve the deleted data as well.
When questioned, the ASG said those extracted data would be available as a form of replication which was readable and he said the data could be copied to an external drive and given to the Counsel appearing for the individuals under investigation, on the assurance of protecting their privacy.

Invest in the future and donate to Project Little Hearts
	
ealth is a primary need in any society. Sri Lankans are fortunate to enjoy a free health system in the country. People who have really benefited from the system will vouch for it. Unfortunately most of them dont think that they need to speak about it because they are already served with this facility. In other words they have taken this service for granted. The best example is the children who were treated for heart disease and critical illnesses at the Lady Ridgeway Hospital (LRH). Since 2005, over 10,000 children have undergone catheter based interventions or diagnostic procedures at LRH. Since 2007, over 7000 children have undergone cardiac surgeries. All these procedures were done totally free, but the actual cost could have varied from Rs. 30,000 to over one million a procedure. This is the full side of the half-filled glass of water. Unfortunately there is an empty side which is almost equal to the full side. An equal number of children with heart diseases or critical illnesses are added to the waiting lists as the hospital doesnt have adequate facilities to treat all children in need. They occasionally make their voices heard when they ask for financial assistance to seek treatment in the private sector or overseas. Most of them continue having their names in waiting lists and even without their knowledge eventually lose their beloved child. Certain losses can be accepted, but the preventable loss of a child cant be accepted under any circumstance. Who will say no to it, if it can be prevented by improving infrastructure facilities 

Improving infrastructure facilities 
Project Little Hearts was initiated with only the sole objective of minimising the number of preventable childhood deaths in Sri Lanka. Approximately 375,000 children are born annually in Sri Lanka and around 3000 of them leave this world even before reaching their first birthday. Out of this, about 1500 deaths can be prevented every year through improvement of infrastructure facilities to treat heart diseases and critical illness in children. Considering the geographical, infrastructure and population characteristics of Sri Lanka, the best and most cost effective intervention is to expand the facilities to treat such children at the LRH, the premier public childrens hospital which provides free treatment to children from all districts of Sri Lanka. The first step in addressing the issue is development infrastructure facilities. Little Hearts is a project initiated to construct and commission a ten (10) storey Cardiac and Critical Care Complex to provide necessary infrastructure facilities for such children. 
The proposal for this building came up in 2013, with the expansion of the cardiac complex at LRH. It was initially planned as a four storied building to accommodate the need to perform 2000 surgeries and 1000 catheter based interventions to treat all children with heart diseases in Sri Lanka. However, considering the limited space available and other requirements of the hospital, the building was later expanded to a ten storeyed complex with addition of Medical Intensive care unit, Neonatal Intensive care unit and training facilities required in a tertiary care teaching hospital. Planning is done by the Central Engineering Consultancy Bureau (CECB). The Ministry of Health and Department of National planning has provided necessary approvals. Land has been allocated according to the master plan of the hospital. What is left now is the raising of funds and the construction. 


Our target is to raise Rs. two billion thats required for construction and commissioning of this Cardiac and Critical Care Complex at LRH. If we have charged Rs. 120,000 from all 17,000 patients who have undergone treatment for their cardiac condition at LRH, we could have easily built this complex. But as treatment was given totally free, today we have to seek public support to expand the facility. Two billion is a colossal amount of money to raise this facility, but if we all get together and donate whatever we can, we can raise even double that amount in no time. We need only willingness to donate and to do it without a delay. Everyday that we delay the project, we lose about 4-5 children. Imagine the publics interest in saving 5 children getting drowned or being caught up in a fire. In such a situation, everybody will do his/her part without a delay. That is because they see the need themselves. These children die at different places due to different reasons. Only we know that they have died due to heart disease. Therefore, you need to believe in us. Dont wait until it happens to your own child or your grandchild as it may be too late. 
Mr & Mrs Pathirana with their baby operated at LRH
Those who found true happiness
On the day, when Mrs. Rubasinghe, a retired Clerk, first saw the television program in Derana TV, she realised this need. Her child, who is now a medical student, was treated at LRH in 1992. She called more than 60 people in her list of contacts and requested from them to donate. The following day she arrived at LRH and made a personal donation of Rs. 25,000 to the project as a person who had reaped the benefits of free health care. She wanted the system to improve and save more children. 
Mr. Thabrews granddaughter was about to celebrate her first birthday. He thought that the best gift that he could give to her granddaughter was to save another child in her name. He donated Rs. 10,000 and received a certificate under her granddaughters name in recognition of his efforts to save a child. 
Tehan Dhanushka is a first year student in management faculty at Wayamba University. He has saved Rs. 10,000, from the money he raised by giving tuition to school children, with the view of doing something for the benefit of children. The moment he came to know about the project, he came to LRH and donated it to save another needy child. 


"All top corporates are spending millions on CSR projects. The best CSR project one can carry out is one that will save the life of a child. People who will benefit from this project are the average people working in those corporates"

Mr. and Mrs. Pathirana had their first baby and on the first day itself came to know that the baby had a heart problem. They were helpless as it was a complex condition and the baby was just a newborn weighing even less than 3kg. She was operated at LRH and discharged from hospital. When they came to know about the project, they immediately visited the hospital and donated Rs. 300,000, not because they had enough spare money, but because they came to realise the need to improve such facilities in the government sector. 
At the till donation campaign called Till Parade, children arrived from morning till late evening and donated their Tills to save another child. Within a day it was possible to collect over Rs. 1.4million through till donations alone. Some children had collected money to buy toy cars, dolls or compute games. But they decided to donate all what they had to save another child. They have realised that saving a life is more precious than a car or a doll or a computer game. The happiness that they have experienced by making the donations will last for many decades in their hearts unlike the mental satisfaction they get from a car or a doll.
Prisoners at Welikada Prison are a category in our society without any income. After realising the importance of helping the project they have worked out a way to offer support. The only thing that they can donate is their food which they get from the government. They have decided to donate the cost of their meals for a single day to the Little Hearts Project. This clearly proves that if there is a will, there is a way. 
The way forward..
We need only one million people in Sri Lanka to donate Rs. 100 per month for 2years to raise this amount. We have facilitated that through Dialog and Hutch mobile companies. Any user can send a text message typed REG<Space>LH to 77100 and register for donation. Individually, what can you do with Rs. 100, but if we all work together we can save 1500 critically ill children. Can you imagine the power of masses Why not be one of them
Mrs. Rubasinghe, Mr. Thabrew and Tehan dont belong to the highest income group in Sri Lanka. But they have a heart to give. Having money and giving money are two different things. People who give are the ones who know the happiness and benefits of giving and therefore will continue to give. Once this facility is constructed, we can treat 10,000 children who have heart disease and critical illnesses, annually. In 20 years we can save 200,000 lives. So to initiate the process we need only Rs. 10,000 per life. We need 200,000 people like Tehan, Mr. Thabrew, Mr and Mrs. Pathirana and Mrs. Rubasinghe, who will give something back to the society. If you are one of them, you can visit any BOC branch or visit our website and donate Rs. 10,000 to save a life. You need only a heart to donate. If you have a heart, you will have enough money to donate. 
All top corporates are spending millions on CSR projects. The best CSR project one can carry out is one that will save the life of a child. People who will benefit from this project are the average people working in those corporates. So what you donate is actually donated to look after your own staff. It may not be the average worker and his child. We have seen enough and more instances where critically ill children from the most affluent families die due to lack of facilities in that country. When your child is critically ill even if you can hire an air ambulance, you might not be in a situation to move him out. However much money you have, you cant get a cardiac transplant in a developed country if you arent a citizen in that country. This highlights the need to improve such facilities in our own country, not only to help the poorest of the poor, but to serve all strata of the society if a need arises. We need only 200 companies to donate 10million each. Is your company within that top 200
 
Ways to contribute
We have facilitated almost all the possible ways to donate for the project. Those who are willing to donate Rs. 100 per month can donate using their Dialog or Hutch mobile. Just type REG<space>LH and send a SMS to 77100. Mobitel users can use M Cash to donate. Those who wish to donate online using their credit cards or Sampath Vishwa portal, can do so using our secure website www.littlehearts.lk/donations. If you wish to donate cash, you can either deposit it in our account no 79738633 at BOC by visiting one of the branches of Bank of Ceylon. You can also make donations at any Keels Super outlet islandwide. 
We request children to donate their tills at any BOC branch nearest to them. They will be happy to accept your till. 
If you work in a corporate, you can organise the donation of a days salary or the funds set aside for CSR projects. You may also consider donating a fraction of you profit from each item sold by your company. If your corporate or organisation has a big heart and is ready to donate 200 million, we can name one floor after your company. 
Tehan Dhanushka, a student in Wayamba University, donating money
If you need any further information or request letters please call us at 0766411730 or email us info@littlehearts.lk. 
We have seen parents selling their houses, tractors or whatever they have to seek treatment for their children. As a society, if we can get together, we can prevent it happening to our own brothers and sisters. This isnt only a donation to save another child. It may be your own child or your grandchild who gets treated following a heart disease, dengue or pneumonia in this unit. It will serve the whole country as almost all children with heart diseases and critical illnesses are transferred to LRH. By helping to construct this unit you assure a safe childhood to your loved ones. Do you want to wait for others to do it and risk the life of your beloved child Imagine that your child gets a critical illness and is brought to LRH. How will you feel if we have to say sorry because we cant provide intensive care treatment as all ICU beds are occupied Imagine your situation when you have to witness your beloved child leave this world due to lack of critical care facilities. It has happened in the past and happening at present, but dont let that happen at least in the future. Donate today to prevent it happening in the future.

K.C.Kamalasabayson: IN LOVING MEMORY OF MY FATHER, FRIEND AND GUIDE
	
t has been 10 years since the demise of Mr. K.C.Kamalsabayson PC. A decade is definitely not what it feels like - the final memory of him seems not so long ago, when I desperately yearned for his life. And nothing has changed. 


Looking back ten years ago, I lost my father when I was a law student. I remember when my first year results were released in August 2006, we were in Chennai for his first course of treatment. He was extremely anxious all day until we got the call that I had got through. At that moment I saw in him a very excited child, jumping around the hospital room and announcing to the medical staff my daughter is now a diplomate!. I remember sitting at the edge of his hospital bed while he was walking around the room informing family and friends of the first of my achievements. It was a very happy and fulfilling sight for me. Not once did it occur to me that this could possibly be the only achievement he was to witness in person. In May 2007 I had my second year final exams and I remember how he used to walk me to the entrance of the exam hall for each paper. I remember turning around before the doors of the hall closed behind me only to see my dad standing there waving to me and giving me a thumbs up. He left a week later for his stem-cell transplant in Chennai and just three months later, he left me with the challenge of wading through society by myself. One of the last things he said to me in hospital was please make sure you study. Being qualified is very important. Never ever give up. I can only take solace in the fact that I lived up to his wishes. 
My father was a simple man with a fabulous sense of humor. He loved playing pranks on people; ranging from me to his private secretary. He used to change his voice over the phone and trick me so frequently. On one occasion, when the then President actually called home to speak to him when he was away at a function, I thought it was him pulling my leg as usual! When he got home and I told him I had spoken to the President thinking it was him. I was slightly panicking that the then President might have thought my tone had been obnoxious. He was doubled over laughing. 
Another memory is one of Santa Clause. I was a believer, as are many children. I used to write letters of request to the man in red and my father very graciously undertook the task of posting them. When I was around 9 years old (embarrassingly, still a believer at the time) I had asked for a scrabble board for Christmas. One fine day my father returned from work holding a bag looking rather dubious. I noticed him hiding this bag (he was totally oblivious to the fact that I was peeking) and later found out that it was the very scrabble board which I had asked Santa to deliver. I was heartbroken - mainly because I was upset that I had ruined my fathers age old secret - that he was the household man in red! So I decided to play along and I did so for another couple of years. We were both pretending so that we could give each other this simple joy. Such was our relationship - innocent and beautiful. He was truly my friend, and I absolutely adored him...I still do and I always will. 

"One of the last things he said to me in hospital was please make sure you study. Being qualified is very important. Never ever give up. I can only take solace in the fact that I lived up to his wishes"
He always encouraged me and my mother to pursue our interests. My mother is an artist whose talent she herself had shadowed out for the sake of the family commitments. He encouraged her to paint again. I remember how he would return from work everyday and the first thing he would do would be to check on the progress of the on-going piece of art. The visual of him looking at the canvass with his signature grin and his hands on his waist is still vivid in my mind. He was my biggest fan when it came to my venture in Bharatha Natyam. All I needed was to see him in the audience with a proud look of approval on his face. We were extremely lucky to have had a hands-on and encouraging husband and father. We are strong and independent women mainly because of his role in our lives. 
I had the most wonderful relationship with my father. He may have held high office, but he never compromised on family time. It was never about him making an effort to make time - it was his priority and his work-life balance came most naturally to him. This is a quality which is exceedingly rare in todays context, with the hustle and bustle in the rat race to succeed at the workplace. My father left behind a very prudent lesson - this is not impossible, neither is it a Himalayan task. 

Ten years ago when I lost my father I was very young, distraught and confused, unsure of what was to come, with my mother taking upon herself the arduous task of running the house and educating me. These ten years have taught me many lessons by way of struggles, disappointments, success and hard work. It has taught me the strength of a mother single-handedly molding her daughter into a person fit to survive in society, while grieving the loss of a great man. Ten years later I have earned myself a small place in the legal world, I am a mother, a wife and I stand by my own mother as her companion and daughter. It would have been perfect, if not for the biggest and most painful vacuum  the absence of my father. Yet I do believe that he continues to guide me and I will forever exist in his shadow. 
There was a saying which my father used frequently in his speeches and life in general - Rising to eminence by merit, we may live respected and die regretted.
His life and demise have most certainly been testament to this. We miss you Appa. And we love you more with each passing day.

Private company handling Digital Payment Process: JVP
	
Administering and monitoring of the Digital Payment Process (DPP), earlier under the purview of the Central Bank, has been handed over to a private company, Chief Opposition Whip Anura Kumara Dissanayake told Parliament yesterday.
He said it was transferred to a private company known as, 'Total Pay' by setting up a national payment platform which is a network of payments involving all commercial banks.
Total Pay has placed an advertisement saying the Information Communication Technology (ICTA) permitted it to manageme the payment system," Mr. Dissanayake said.
ICTA CEO Mugundan Kanagay has said before that three companies had been shortlisted for the development and the maintainance of the payment platform. He said this in 2015 but however, Total Pay has been registered in 2016," he added.
Mr. Dissanayake blamed former foreign affairs minister Ravi Karunanayake saying these changes had had taken place during his tenure as finance minister. He said Mr Karunanayake had informed the banks to contact ICTA CEO to obtain the details of the new payment platform.
Mr. Dissanayake said this had happened despite the assurance given by the former finance minister to the Cabinet that Central Bank would continue to manage and monitor this vital payment system.
Placing the National Payment Platform under a private company may lead to money laundering" he said.
Deputy Minister of National Policies and Economic Affairs, Harsha de Silva responded saying the management of the national payment platform was not handed over to any private company. He said Total Pay was a company shortlisted as a potential organization to inspect software involved in the payment platform.
The deputy minister said a payment platform was essential when the country was marching towards the digital era. We have to get out of the Stone Age thinking patterns," he said. (Yohan Perera)

SLFP opposed to postponing PC polls
	
The Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) resolved to oppose the proposed postponement of the provincial council elections till 2019.
The party's central committee took this decision at its meeting on Thursday with President Maithripala Sirisena in the chair.
The decision was taken despite the UNP-SLFP government having prepared a Bill which provides for hold elections to all nine provincial councils on a single day.
Meanwhile, the North-Central, Sabaragamuwa and Eastern Provincial Councils will end their terms of office by October 1, this year and in the event the proposed Bill is enacted in Parliament, the government will be able to postpone elections to these councils.
The SLFP CC resolved that the elections should be held in February or March next year. For this purpose the party felt that the elections to the provincial councils which are yet to complete their tenure should be advanced.
The SLFP was of the view that postponing elections was affront to democracy and that the elections should be conducted under a mix of the First-Past-the-Post System and the Proportional Representation system. (Kelum Bandara)

US must hold SL Govt. accountable for pledges it made: TNA
	
TNA and Opposition Leader R. Sampanthan urged the two US congressmen who were visiting Sri Lanka, that their government must hold the Sri Lankan government accountable for the commitments they have made to the international community particularly with regard to the full implementation of the co-sponsored UNHRC Resolution.
US Congressman Rodney Frelinghuysen and Henry Cuellar arrived in the country on Wednesday and met Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, Speaker Karu Jayasuriya and Opposition Leader R. Sampanthan on Thursday.
During the meeting held with the Opposition Leader, he had said that Sri Lankan government could not evade from its responsibility of fulfilling its commitment made to the international community.
Briefing on the progress of the framing of new Constitution Mr. Sampanthan said there was undue delay in the process and both the UNP and SLFP were holding on to their political future than looking at interest of the country.
After obtaining the majority vote in parliament, the new Constitution must be approved by the people at the referendum. This opportunity should not be missed and Im not speaking only on behalf of Tamils but for the whole Sri Lanka and its people, he added.
Issuing a statement, the TNA said Mr. Sampanthan had stressed that the Sinhala political leaders must go out and campaign on the new constitution which is based on united and indivisible Sri Lanka.
If they do so, not only this process would end in success but also it will clear all the unwarranted doubts that sections of the people have in their minds, he said.
He said that or 50 per cent of the Tamil population had left the country due to this unresolved national question and if we dont find a reasonable solution more people will leave. We dont want that to happen, he added.
Speaking on the unemployment among the youths, Mr. Sampanthan highlighted that the government appears to have no concrete mass jobs. He requested the delegates to initiate proposals in this regard and to support the young people of the country. (KJ and SF)

Wijeyadasa denies charge
	
Justice Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe yesterday denied allegations that he had breached the collective responsibility of the Cabinet by criticizing a decision taken by it. 
The minister was recently criticized by several ministers over a statement he made with regard to regaining of the Hambantota Port. 
The minister said it was not a criticism but a comment made to retrieve a national asset. 
The Cabinet decision was to lease out the Hambantota Port and I didnt challenge or criticize it.
I simply mentioned a way to secure a national asset legally when the time comes, he said. The minister said, as someone who always stood by the country, he was able to intervene and help the government to regain the Sri Lanka Transport Board, Sri Lanka Insurance Company and the Apollo Hospital in Colombo which is now renamed as Lanka Hospital on previous occasions. 
He also said it seemed that there was no collective responsibility in the Cabinet anymore. 
It was only last week the Cabinet approved the 20th Amendment to the Constitution but this week SLFP Ministers upon meeting the President said that they would go against the decision. Is this maintaining the collective responsibility There are a variety of opinions expressed in a unity government. he said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)
