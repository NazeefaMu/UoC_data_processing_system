Action should be taken against those who deforest Wilpattu National Park
	
Coalition to Protect Our National Heritage said yesterday if former Minister Wimal Weerawansa was remanded for misusing state vehicles, politicians and government servants who were behind the deforestation of the Wilpattu National Park should also be brought before the FCID and CID.
Environmental activist Nayanaka Ranwella said the devastators of the environment should have been in prison for causing an irreparable loss to the environment and added that they were urging the government to implement the law against the culprits.
While Wimal Weerawansa was arrested for misusing state vehicles, politicians and government servants who destroyed Wilpattu National Park are at large. We can buy vehicles but we cannot repair the destruction caused to the environment, he said.
He told a news conference that more than 3, 400 acres of the Wilpattu Forest Reserve had been destroyed and that the deforestation was continuing under the present government as well.
He urged the President as the Environmental Minister to mediate in resolving the issue as it would endanger the rare Villu eco-systems.
Environmental Activist Sajeewa Chamikara said people from other areas were being settled in Wilpattu Forest Reserve for political advantage claiming that it was resettlement.
It is not resettlement which is happening in these areas. People from other areas are brought to these deforested areas on political requirements. Minister Rishad Bathiudeen is trying to justify his taking over of the forested areas, he said.
He said 280 acres of forested land was taken over by Minister Bathiudeen and Basil Rajapaksa by forcing the Forest Department to release the land during the previous government and added that over 1, 700 acres had been cleared illegally so far.
The Forest Department officials were helpless as they were unable to take action against them, he said. (Ajith Siriwardana)

Activists not so gay
	
A number of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender and Queer (LGBTQ) and human rights activists were critical of the Cabinet of ministers refusal to decriminalize homosexuality.
One of the leading LGBTQ rights activists and Executive Director of the Equal Ground, Rosanna Flamer-Caldera said the decision was absurd.
This move only portrays that the government would rather continue to discriminate a community based on their sexual orientation and to marginalize them than repealing a 134-year old archaic laws imposed by the British, she said. 
She urged the government to fight for the rights of the discriminated people and challenged if there is anyone who says that decriminalizing homosexuality is against Dhamma, to prove it.
Why we should embrace western Christian laws and not accept peace, acceptance and tolerance practiced in Buddhism.
After all this is a Buddhist country not a Christian country, she said. Former Human Rights Commissioner and Rights Activist Prathiba Mahanamahewa said, though it was rejected, the proposal submitted by the government to decriminalize homosexuality by repealing section 365 and 365A of the Penal Code was brave and strong.
He criticized the government of having no proper mechanism to spread awareness of the issue and its lack of backing to commit to the issue.
Though a proposal had been made, there is no one to take responsibility of the proposal. This attempt is not to legalise gay marriages or as such, its simply about decriminalizing homosexuality. The government had clearly failed to send the message across, he said.
He said the Sri Lankan LGBTQ community was inactive compared with that of in India and Bangladesh and said even lawmakers were also silent about the issue.
If there are any lawmakers who are gay or lesbian, they are not raising any voice for their rights. They are not even admitting to anything.
These people are simply worried about the next election and their voters base. They would rather have a larger voter base than fighting for human rights, he said.
He said cultural and social resistance could arise when repealing the penal code but it could be averted with awareness. The people should have a right to select their own partner. This is a human right issue which has been psychologically and scientifically proved, he said.
Meanwhile, rights activist Milinda Rajapaksha, who was with youth organizations in India when Delhi High Court decriminalized homosexuality in 2009, said rights organizations in Sri Lanka should take the issue to the court following India.
In India, it was not the government which intervened into the matter. It was civil societies and rights activists sought legal protection for human rights and they won. Its time we should do the same, he said.
Project Officer of Equal Ground Thushara Manoj said the words sexual orientation and gender identity should be included in Constitution foremost before decriminalizing homosexuality. Once we have these words, we can gradually decriminalize.
Decriminalizing homosexuality is not something we can do right away and Sri Lankan Gay Community is not asking for marriage rights. They simply want equal human rights and recognition, he said. He said it was wrong and unwise for the government to list GSP+ as causality to decriminalize homosexuality. Another activist Hans Billimoria simply said its time that we moved away from the dark ages. Its 2017, not 1800s anymore, he said. (By Lahiru Pothmulla)

Air strike on displaced camp in Nigeria kills 52
	

At least 52 aid workers and civilians were killed on Tuesday when an air force jet accidentally bombed a camp in northeast Nigeria instead of Boko Haram militants, medical charity MSF said. The incident happened at about 9:00 am (0800 GMT) in Rann, in the far north of Borno state, the epicentre of the jihadists insurgency, as food was being distributed to displaced people. 
There was no official death toll from the military, which blamed the fog of war for the mistake, but one senior commander described the casualties from the air strike as huge. 
One local resident, Abba Abiso, told AFP: At least 25 were killed and many more injured. 
The medical charity Doctors Without Borders (MSF) said at least 120 people were wounded and 52 killed following todays bombing, calling the attack shocking and unacceptable. 
The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said six Nigerian Red Cross members were among those killed while 13 others were injured.  Nigerias President Muhammadu Buhari said in a statement he received with regret news of the bombing and said he sympathised with the families of the dead and injured. 
The bombing comes as Nigerias military claims further gains against the Islamic State group affiliate, pushing them out of captured territory and their remote bases in Borno. 
Last month, the army said the conflict was in its final stages after nearly eight years of violence that has killed at least 20,000 and left more than 2.6 million others homeless.

When its their turn, the White House staffers enter for a few private moments with President Barack Obama, a photo and a farewell hug from the boss. 
Theres a mass exodus underway this week at the White House. As Obama holds his last news conference Wednesday, his staff is busy packing up their offices and turning in their Black Berrys.

Brazilian police fire  rubber bullets at inmates who set jail on fire
	
Daily Mail/18 January 2017- 
Brazilian police were forced to fire rubber bullets at inmates after a brutal prison riot claimed 26 lives. 
Violence erupted at Alcacuz jail near the city of Natal, in Brazil, leading to fires breaking out and serious injuries to inmates. 
The army has been called in to help contain the riot which started on Saturday and some inmates have been arrested. 
It is believed the jail was overcome after rival drugs gangs fought each other. 
Cons climbed on the roof and set up barriers of furniture as the crews vowed to behead each other. 
Police fired rubber bullets to try to keep rival factions apart, sending the inmates fleeing in panic and drawing screams from their relatives gathered outside the prison walls. 
Two days later, crowds of inmates are still loose in the open air - between the prison blocks and the outer walls of the complex. 
Television images have also shown inmates sharpening machetes.

Dundee man turns Sri Lankan street dog into yoga star
	
A yoga instructor from Dundee, Scotland has told the amazing story of how the dog he rescued while on holiday has become his student.
Finlay Wilson enjoyed a trip to Sri Lanka last January with his partner, where he regularly practised yoga.
Each morning as he practised, Finlay would be joined by an inquisitive young stray dog.
Dismayed at the way local people treated the animal, Finlay grew close to the curious dog, who he later named Amaloh.
Upon leaving Sri Lanka, Finlay decided to adopt Amaloh.
After his new pet spent nine months in quarantine, Finlay and Amaloh were finally reunited and now enjoy sharing their yoga poses with fans.
Finlay revealed: One of the videos weve done has had 775,000 views. Everyone loves a dog video and random yoga videos.
Maybe its because its January as well and everyone is into their fitness.
I would roll out the mat (while in Sri Lanka) and Amaloh would trot up, he was maybe a year or a year and a half old.
I was shocked at the way the people where I stayed treated him. They would kick him.
When I woke up in the morning Amaloh used to be sitting outside my room.
Ive always had dogs and when I saw the way he was treated and how sweet he was I decided to take him home.
By sharing examples of their work together, the pair have gathered quite a fan base.
Finlay explained: Amaloh is actually pretty good.
If I put my elbows down, he puts his down. If I put my hands on the floor, he does the same.
Its not just that Im exercising, yoga makes me a bit more mindful. Its the entire well being yoga gives.
It helps keep me human. If Im not doing yoga you wouldnt want to be around me.
Finlay, who has been studying yoga for 10 years after injury prevented him from pursuing an interest in lacrosse continued:
Loads of charities have been in touch since the video went up and now its creeping up to one million views.
When I first met Amaloh he was malnourished, covered in bugs and you could see every rib.
He arrived here in late September and in the last two months hes become a lot more comfortable.
When I get on the mat he cuts some shapes and sees it as play time.(The Courier)

Fitch Ratings Lanka Limited (Fitch) has affirmed National Development Bank PLC (NDB) a Long Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) of A+ (lka) with an Outlook Stable pursuant to Fitchs revised its ratings followed by its periodic review. 
According to Fitchs report on its rating action for NDB, NDBs ratings reflect its satisfactory asset quality, weaker franchise and lower capitalization relative to higher rated peers. Fitch believes the banks higher risk appetite could dilute the benefit of nay possible capital infusions.

The Bank is also buffered against the high capital adequacy levels of the NDB Group, the Tier I of which is at over 10 percent, well above the statutory minimum requirement of 5 percent.
NDB is internally mindful of the need for the infusion of fresh capital, and will communicate its plans towards this end, once it is in a position to do so. NDB remains committed to its ambitious profitable growth plans, in yielding sustainable returns to its shareholders, customers and all other stakeholders.

Good health is necessary to prevent NCDs
	

Being healthy is necessary to avert non-communicable diseases. Today, non-communicable diseases are more widespread than in previous decades. Thus, it is important to follow a proper dietary pattern as well as to exercise regularly. However, most people do not follow this lifestyle due to various reasons including a busy way of life, laziness, medical conditions and depending on the climate. Both diet control and exercise should be done in parallel so as to have good results. 

Following are some health tips to control diet and exercise: 
The main point we should consider when controlling our nutrition is to have a proper balanced diet. This should include foods containing all the required nutrients in correct amounts. The food guide pyramid for Sri Lankans can give us an idea of this. Our diet should include cereals, whole grains, fruits and vegetables, milk and dairy products, fish, meat, eggs, other animal products and fats.
Processed foods/junk foods such as ice cream, cakes, short eats and soft drinks should be avoided. Though tempting in appearance, it is important to think of the risks before eating them. When we eat one ice-cream we might have to do add an extra hour to our jogging or exercise session. Otherwise, the results of three days of exercise sessions will be lost. If we think about this before we eat, our preference for these foods will reduce. 
People say they live to eat. But the correct way of thinking is to eat to live. We should not allow food to control us. Some people find it difficult to control the amount of food they eat. Such people may have a glass of water or some fruits before their meals. Fruits are a good option because of their health benefits. 
As Sri Lankans, we consume rice and curry for our main meals. However, this is not compulsory. Rice can be replaced with cereals like mung beans, chick peas, cow peas and manioc, bread fruit and sweet potato for breakfast or dinner. It is important to reduce our rice intake when alternatives are available. We should also choose fresh foods over processed foods. Consuming fruits and vegetables in raw form has many benefits. Certain nutrients can be destroyed during cooking and the fibre content in raw foods provide benefits that will reduce the risk of contracting non-communicable diseases. 
Drinking plenty of water is also necessary as our body requires water to function. We can also drink green tea, belimal and ranawara polpala beverages during the day. However, these should be consumed without adding sugar or jaggery. Having meals with a group (with family members, relatives or friends) other than having meals alone or while watching television, is also encouraged. 
Apart from dietary patterns, exercising also plays a role in maintaining health as mentioned above. It is recommended to engage in exercises for at least 30 minutes per day on at least five days a week. This should be done regularly and should not be overlooked. We should develop an interest in it first. If it is not possible to exercise outside it can be done inside
the house. 
Regular monitoring of weight should also be done at least once a month. If we follow these points, 3kg of body weight could be lost within a month. This way, we can protect ourselves from contracting non-communicable disease with ease.

JO lodges complaints with BC and CID
	
The Joint Opposition yesterday lodged a complaint with the Bribery Commission and the CID against Public Enterprise Development Minister Kabir Hashim, management of the SriLankan Airline and Prime Minister's Advisor Charitha Ratwatte.
In its complaint, the JO alleged that the government had incurred a loss of Rs. 150 billion when cancelling an order to purchase three Airbuses for SriLankan Airlines from the AerCap Company.
Minister Hashim, SriLankan Airline Chairman, its CEO and members of the Director Board are responsible for this colossal loss. Prime Minister's Advisor Charitha Ratwatte is responsible for aiding and abetting in this fraud. It was reported that a government bigwig had obtained a commission of US$ 10 million by cancelling the Airbus deal, MP Kanaka Herath, who lodged the complaint, said.
He said the new government cancelled the order made by the previous government to purchase three Airbuses in an attempt to restructure the national carrier. The cancellation had resulted in the AerCap asking for a compensation of US$104 million from Sri Lanka since the aircraft had already been made.
The subject ministry was in discussions with the said company to sell the ordered aircraft to another airline service so that we dont have to pay any compensation. Despite these attempts, the SriLankan management had entered into an agreement with the company to pay Rs. 150 billion as compensation based on an email by Charitha Ratwatte. This agreement had been signed without any approval from the ministry, Cabinet or the Attorney General, MP Herath said.
He said President Maithripala Sirisena had issued an order saying any decision on paying compensation to the AerCap should be taken by the subject ministry. SriLankan has disregarded Presidents orders, he said.
The MPs of the JO requested the Bribery Commission and the CID to take action against those who are responsible for the grave loss. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

Laser treatment for skin conditions: Is it for you
	

Laser treatment is more effective than conventional treatments such as creams when treating blemishes, acne scars, wrinkles and certain other skin-related issues. Laser treatment is as of yet a novel technology in Sri Lanka which people are hesitant to undergo due to the mystery surrounding it.

LASER stands for Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation

A laser beam is concentrated on irregular or blemished skin so that its irregularity is removed gradually. Most often, several sessions of such treatment are essential for optimum results. Debunking myths related to laser treatment, Dr. Nayani Madarasingha, Consultant Dermatologist explained when laser treatment proves to be beneficial, its preconditions, side-effects, benefits and precautions. 
QWhat is laser treatment
LASER stands for Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation. Lasers have been used for decades in other countries including India. It is used in different fields of medicine to treat skin, eye-related and urinal problems as well as varicose veins. However, this kind of treatment is fairly new when it comes to dermatological issues. 

Laser treatment can cure blemishes, acne scars, wrinklesand other skin-related problems
There are different types of laser treatments available and the correct type should be given depending on the condition. Sometimes people come and say theyve undergone laser treatment but that it has not been effective. There are so many things to consider- whether it was the correct type of laser, how it was given, the dosage and the standard of the machine- for it to be effective.
It has to be done by a qualified doctor who has a good understanding of skin and related problems as well as laser. 
QWhen do you perform laser treatment
Laser treatment related to skin issues are manifold. We can help women with excessive hair through permanent hair reduction laser treatment. Through laser treatment, the hair becomes thinner and almost invisible. It can be used to reduce hair anywhere and even men can go through laser treatment. It is widely done and gives very good results. 

Different types of laser treatments are given depending on the condition

The visibility of scars such as those present due to chicken pox, surgery, pimples and stretch marks could be reduced, as their depth is reduced through the laser.
You can see a striking change in just one session if the scars are superficial. However many sessions will be required for better results. Laser treatment is also administered for skin rejuvenation and to get rid of wrinkles. Birthmarks can be removed. Black patches caused due to certain pigmentary problems can be erased. Not all black marks can be erased in this manner. Tattoos and thread veins (tiny veins which run close to the surface of the skin) can also
be removed. 
QWhat requirements need to be met before undergoing laser treatment
We dont do laser treatment if youre pregnant or breastfeeding. There is no specific age limit. It can be done to children. Other medical conditions are not problems to be concerned about either. Laser treatment requires several sessions. Usually, there is a gap of at least a month or two between sessions. So you need to plan ahead and be patient with the treatment. 

Laser treatment requiresseveral sessions


Q What are the side effects
Redness, swelling, skin darkening and very rarely scars. If it is done properly and if the person follows the instructions given, the negative consequences can be minimized. Sometimes we can do a test patch to see how the skin reacts before going ahead with thefull procedure. 
QAny precautions to take after undergoing laser treatment
Depending on the laser used, the type of pre and post laser treatment will differ. It is compulsory to avoid sunlight after undergoing treatment. Otherwise, the skin might end up darkening. This is the main concern related to laser treatment. Contracting skin cancers and other diseases is false. They are myths.
QWhat are the benefits of laser treatment compared to traditional treatment
If you take creams and tablets, there is a certain extent to which they could be effective. If there is an acne scar, for instance, the laser can get into the deep layer of the skin and reduce its visibility.
This amount of improvement cannot be achieved by applying cream. There are certain skin issues ( Tattoo removal, thread veins) where drugs and creams have no place in the treatment.

CANCN AFP/ Jan18, 2017- 
Mexicos Mayan Riviera was rocked by a second shooting in two days, leaving a total of nine people dead in a major tourist destination that had avoided the violence plaguing other regions.

Three gunmen and a police officer died as the Quintana Roo state prosecutors office in Cancun came under fire in broad daylight on Tuesday and police shot back, Governor Carlos Joaquin Gonzalez said. 
Five other assailants were detained, Gonzalez said. 
The gunfight caused panic in the Caribbean coast city, a day after three foreigners and two Mexicans died in a shooting at an electronic music festival in the nearby seaside resort of Playa del Carmen. 
While it was not known whether the two shootings were linked, the back-to-back attacks broke the peace in a spot beloved by American, Canadian and European tourists that has been spared from the sort of drug-related violence afflicting other parts of Mexico.

NSB receives AAA(lka) national long-term rating for 15th year
	

Fitch Ratings has affirmed the AAA (lka) national long-term rating to NSB with Stable Outlook following their periodic review of the large banks peer group which was announced by the Fitch recently.
NSB is the first Sri Lankan bank to affirm AAA(lka) rating from Fitch Ratings and the only bank to retain the same rating for 15 consecutive years. This is a significant achievement by
the Bank.
Fitch confirms that authorities would support, in case of need, the banks depositors and senior unsecured creditors to maintain confidence and systemic stability due to the Banks policy mandate of mobilising retail savings and investing them in government securities and explicit deposit guarantee provided by the NSB Act.
Further, AAA(lka) National Long-Term Rating of NSB is Stable, as National Rating reflects the banks creditworthiness relative to the best credit in Sri Lanka, and as such, is unlikely to change due to sovereign rating action.
Fitch has affirmed the Long-Term Issuer Default Ratings (IDRs) of NSB as B+ with negative outlook which is equal to the
sovereign rating.
Ratings affirmed to NSB by Fitch includes; National Long-Term Rating affirmed at AAA(lka); Stable Outlook, Support Rating affirmed at 4, Support Rating Floor affirmed at B+, US dollar senior unsecured notes affirmed at B+; Recovery Rating at RR4, Long-Term Foreign-Currency IDR affirmed at B+; Negative Outlook and Long-Term Local Currency IDR affirmed at B+; Negative Outlook.

SL is in talks to offer the Trinco port to India: Fonseka
	
Speaking to The Hindu on the sidelines of the Raisina Dialogue in New Delhi, Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka, Colombos Minister of Regional Development, said that the decision on offering the port to India will be taken soon.
Talks are at present going on between India and Sri Lanka and we hope to offer the Trincomalee port, which is one of the best deep sea ports in the world, to India, said Mr. Fonseka speaking to The Hindu on the sidelines of the Raisina Dialogue. Trincomalee has been on the table for sometime as Sri Lanka wants to maintain a neutral stand and provide equal access to its ports to both China and India.
Sri Lankas experience with the Chinese, who carried out major infrastructural work at the Hambantota port in southern coast of the island nation, has put a heavy burden on the country, said Mr Fonseka.
Our experience [with the Chinese] on Hambantota has not been very beneficial as we are facing a heavy debt burden due to the work done in that port. The problems and corruption in the project prompted us to review our policy on infrastructural development. We have currently given the port to a private entity so that some of the more immediate issues are resolved. This arrangement will also address Indias security concerns, said Mr. Fonseka, indicating that Sri Lanka is willing to address Indias concerns on the visit of Chinese nuclear submarines to Sri Lanka.
The port of Hambantota was conceived as a major Sri Lanka-China project during the presidency of Mahinda Rajapakse, but the controversy around the debt burden has slowed down the project.
Speaking at the Raisina Dialogue, Mr. Fonseka, who led the Sri Lankan defence forces during the 2009 Eelam war against Tamil rebels, said that Colombo is aware of its responsibilities in the Indian Ocean region, and is committed to freedom of navigation.
Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka said that Sri Lanka will remain committed to the fight against terrorism and extremist violence in the region and beyond.
Recollecting the fight against the Tamil Tigers, he said that insurgency often receives extra-territorial support, and pointed at the support for the Tamil Tigers from India.
Some political parties and leaders from the southern part of India, extended support to the Tamil rebels at the time of the war due to narrow political interests, he said.

Special ops to find vehicles with tinted front windows
	
Police today launched a 13-day long operation to inspect vehicles with tinted or curtained front windows.
The operation will continue till January 31.
Police said front windscreen of the vehicle should also be clear.
It has been found that the rise of accidents involving motor vehicles is largely due to tinted or curtained front windows, police said.
The use of tinted glasses is appended in Government Gazette 875/08 on 16.06.1995 and Gazette number 1273/28 on 31.01,2003. It is an offence for the windscreen and the two shutters besides the driver to be tinted. A 20% tinted glass could be used only on the top portion of the windscreen, the Gazette states.
Police Spokesman DIG Priyantha Jayakody said Police would strictly implement the regulation and track down vehicles that have any kind of tinted glass or curtains in the front, during the operation.
He said motorists would be warned for the first time but legal action would be taken if the tint or curtains were not removed.
Earlier DIG Traffic said that it was legal to tint or curtain the back windows and VIP vehicles coming under the purview of Ministries were exempted from this regulation, if they had the necessary approval.
The Police carried out a similar operation in October 2016.(Darshana Sanjeewa)

US firm to take over Survey Dept. work: Union
	
The Government Surveyors Association (GSA) said yesterday that there was a move to hand over several operations of the Sri Lanka Survey Department (SLSD), including Land Information System (LIS) and Aerial Survey Operations to a US-based company for 15-years.
Speaking to Daily Mirror, the association's president, Duminda Udugoda referred to an attempt to transfer the duties of the SLSD to Trimble Navigation Ltd, a US-based land administration solutions group. The association said that the preliminary measures had been already taken to reassign the most of the SLSD's activities to the foreign company.
The GSA president said that the management had said that the United States government had placed the operation on them forcibly.
Our first step is to notify the people of the ongoing scandal. The GSA will keep its eyes open regarding the matter, unlike other trade unions which run behind money or fame. Stern action will be taken in future if the government fails to halt the scam, he added.
Answering a Daily Mirror inquiry regarding the matter, SLSD Additional Surveyor General (Field) K. A Kasthuri said that such an operational devolution had not yet been introduced and the GSA's statement was inaccurate.
He further said the GSA has misled the media for their petty political gains. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

Yemens female fighters carry their toddlers  to an anti-Saudi rally
	

Daily Mail/ 17 January 2017- Yemeni female fighters took to the streets carrying their toddlers, rocket launchers and machine guns to send a powerful message to the Saudi-led coalition who have played a part in a two-year war that has claimed 10,000 civilian lives. 
A day earlier, a UN envoy held talks with Yemens President Abedrabbo Mansour Hadi in an attempt to return to a ceasefire and for political talks to end the brutal conflict. The United Nations said the civilian death toll in fighting since a Saudi-led force intervened in March 2015 had reached 10,000, up from the previous figure of 7,000.
