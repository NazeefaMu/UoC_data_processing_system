MPs comment on Constitution without knowing facts: PM
	
The Members of Parliament were issuing statements and comments about the new Constitution without knowing exact details, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said this morning.
Prime Minster Wickremesinghe made this statement during a ceremony held at Temple Trees to distribute compensation to flood victims of Kolonnawa.
"We have decided to include the responses of political parties in the interim report so that MPs could study them before coming for the debate. Some MPs utter things without knowing the details," the Premier said.
The Prime Minister also criticised the media saying that the print media in particular, were trying to sabotage the Constitution making process.
"We have decided to adopt a speedy process to provide compensation to those who are affected by natural disasters. News such as these should be main stories or page-one stories. However, print media is giving space to stories which are opposed to a new Constitution, he said.
A new Constitution has not been prepared yet. Show us the draft of the new Constitution if there is one. Do not mislead the people in this manner. People will go against media at the end of the day, if they continued to mislead them," he said.
Mr. Wickremesinghe said 70, 000 families who were affected by landslides have been paid compensation so far.
A total of Rs3.6 billion has been paid to landslide and flood victims of 2016, he said.
He said that Rs.1.3 billion had been paid to flood victims of 2017.
"I have instructed relevant institutions to make the payments to all victims by end November this year. I shall visit flood hit areas in the south and see for myself the progress made on paying compensation to the flood and landslides victims. We have instructed the institutions to pay compensation to all victims according to government estimates. We can pay more if the people appeal" he said.
"The Government has decided to introduce a new speedy process of paying compensation to victims of natural disasters. Usually it takes around five years to complete the compensation paying process.
However we have decided to expedite this process. It is the people who are going to suffer when payments are delayed as value of the funds given to them declines as a result of devaluation of the rupee. Rupee is devalued in Sri Lanka as Sri Lanka is a country which is set to settle its borrowings, which has exceeded Rs. 3 trillion" the Prime Minister added.
He said that steps had been taken to prepare Sri Lanka to face global climate changes as well. (Yohan Perera)

Philippines Vice President warns of China debt trap, cites SL
	
Philippines Vice President Leni Robredo said she feared Philippines might get stuck in a debt trap like the one experienced by Sri Lanka if they borrowed loans from China, Philippines media reported.

The Duterte administrations new source of financing for its ambitious infrastructure projects, China, could lead the Philippines into a debt trap as it did to other countries that had borrowed heavily from the Asian giant, according to Philippines Vice President.
Robredo cited the project to build a new Bicol Express, a rail system connecting Manila and Bicol region, for P175 billion, which would come from a Chinese loan, the Philippine media reported.
Robredo said there should be a better way to finance the project other than through loans from China.
First of all, its debt. Very huge, P171 billion. Thats very huge, said Robredo, who is a native of Naga. Our fear is we might get stuck in a debt trap like the one experienced by Sri Lanka, she said.
According to BBC.com, Sri Lanka had relied so heavily on loans, mostly from China, that 95 percent of all government revenues now go to debt repayment alone.
Many of the projects funded by Chinese loans turned out to be non-profitable, according to the BBC.com report.
Of course, if its debt, we will be the ones to bear the burden. It should be decided on properly, Robredo said.
But Robredo said it seemed like economic managers, who had presented financing models for the rail projects, were no longer looking at any alternative.
She said she had asked Cesar Chavez, a former dzRH reporter and transportation undersecretary, and Mercedita Sombillo, assistant economic planning secretary, to look at alternatives and give us whats the most favorable for all.
Robredo said that while she was not opposed to Chinas role in the Build, Build, Build infrastructure plan of President Duterte, concerns had been raised about the profitability of some of the projects.
She said the proposal of three private companies that had expressed interest on the Bicol rail project as a private-public partnership (PPP) was also worth looking at. She did not identify the companies, though.
Why not look at that Robredo said. She said that if the government waited to settle concerns about profiting by the private firms, the process might take longer.
Mr. Duterte had cozied up to China and Russia after ranting at the United States, the Philippines traditional ally, largely as a result of US officials criticism of summary killings that became part of Mr. Dutertes war on drugs.
Mr. Dutertes predecessor, Benigno Aquino III, had tried to promote the PPP model as a means to build key infrastructure without spending government money.

Constitution making: Kotte Chapter says not at this juncture
	
Kalyani Karaka Sabha of the Kotte, Sri Kalyani Samagri Dharma Maha Sangha Sabha yesterday unanimously decided that the proposals put forward by the steering committee on the drafting of the new Constitution should be temporarily withdrawn stating that the drafting of a new Constitution was not suitable at this juncture, Anunayake of the Kotte Sri Kalyani Samagri Dharma Maha Sangha Sabha Prof. Ven. Bellanwila Wimalarathana Thera said today.
Ven. Wimalarathana Thera said serious issues may arise if Parliament accepted the proposals submitted as alternatives regarding the unitary State, security of the country, and Buddhism.
The Thera said the proposals on the new Constitution should be temporarily withdrawn and if amendments to the Constitution were needed, it could be done later.
After having discussions for about two hours on the proposals on the new Constitution, Ven. Wimalarathana Thera told media that the Kalyani Karaka Sabha convened in the absence of the Mahanayake of the Kotte, Sri Kalyani Samagri Dharma Maha Sangha Sabha Most Venerable Ittapane Dhammalankara Thera as he was leaving the country last night.
The Thera said they would issue a joint announcement on the matter shortly and added that Karaka Sabha convened with the blessing of the Mahanayake Thera and that he would approve the decision taken by the Karaka Sabha.
In response to a question that the President and the Prime Minister had stated that this was only a set of proposals, the Thera said they knew that it was not a draft or a bill but the new Constitution would be based on these proposals.
We wanted to reveal our stance before it was drafted so that it could be useful to those involved in the drafting of the Constitution, he said. (Ajith Siriwardana)

Dismay over failed Indo-Lankan talks
	
Fishermen leaders have expressed dismay over the failure of the third meeting of the India-Sri Lanka Joint Working Group (JWG) and the ministerial meeting that followed to work out a time frame for the release of fishermen and more than 130 trawlers detained in Sri Lanka and to end bottom trawling in the Palk Bay.
The leaders regretted that the meetings held in New Delhi on October 13 and 14 to discuss fishermen issues and the release of the apprehended fishermen and their trawlers detained in Lanka for more than a year ended without arriving at any tangible decisions.
It is very unfortunate that the Lankan side ended the meetings after making a vague statement that it would take up the issues relating to the release of fishermen and trawlers at an appropriate forum, fishermen leader P Sesu Raja said.
After the recent release of fishermen and 42 trawlers, impounded by the Lankan navy in April 2015, the fishermen had high hopes that the JWG, set up to address their issues, and the ministerial level meeting would work out a time frame for the release of fishermen and their trawlers but the meetings turned out to be a formality, he rued.
It was also unfortunate that the Sri Lankan side, while acknowledging Indias recent initiatives to end bottom trawling in the Palk Bay, had not changed its stance that it would continue to prevent illegal fishing in Lankan waters and arrest Indian fishermen who trespassed.
We had high hopes that India will prevail upon the Lankan side and secure the release of fishermen and boats and give time to phase out bottom trawling in the Palk Bay only to be disappointed, the leaders said.
After the meetings, the Indian and Sri Lankan sides agreed that a lasting solution to the fishermen issue should be found at the earliest but made no serious efforts towards the direction, they felt. The Lankan side only seemed to be crushing the livelihood of Indian fishermen, they alleged.
Pointing that they were making sincere efforts to switch over to deep sea fishing, the leaders said a lasting solution could be found only if the fishermen were given one or two years to phase out bottom trawling in the Pak Bay.
Stating that there was no assurance from the Lankan side, they said only if the trawlers were released, those fishermen could opt for tuna long liners.(The Hindu)
