Advice that amazed them
	

A purohita handling a key portfolio had a ceremony held in his office to mark the resumption of duties for the new year 2017.

This purohita who once excelled in a popular game had been at loggerheads with the highest authorities in yahapalanaya over plans to hand over a port coming under his purview to a foreign investor under a Public-Private-Partnership agreement.
Addressing the members of his staff, the purohita had said:  I tried my level best to save this place from being handed over to foreigners. But all my efforts have gone down the drain. If you look forward to securing a job for a child of yours at this place in the future, take some decisive action  some course of action like the strike they launched in the recent past to chase me out -- to prevent this port from going into foreign hands. This is all I have got to tell you 
The purohitas exhortation left the entire staff stunned with amazement, they say.

Being liberal with public funds
	

It is not unusual for the Ministries and statutory bodies to print diaries and calendars for distribution among well-wishers and clients as a token of goodwill. However, a Ministry handling public funds is said to have brought out a diary for 2017 at an unusually heavy cost, they say.

This attractive diary - each copy costing the exchequer about Rs.8,000 has been printed by a company owned by a nightingale domiciled in the UK and it is intended for distribution among a select few, they say.
What a waste of money at a time the government is in dire straits being strapped for funds even to meet essential public expenditure, lament the Ministry employees.

BOC launches Branch on Wheels
	

The countrys number one bank, Bank of Ceylons (BOC) newest value addition to its customers is Branch on wheels, which was launched ceremoniously yesterday with the patronage of the banks Chairman Ronald C. Perera and General Manager
D.M. Gunasekera.
Deputy General Manager Sales and Channel Management Senarath Bandara, members of the corporate and executive management and other officials were also present.
This mobile branch vehicle includes a teller counter, customer area, ATM and a self-service kiosk. A wider range of banking services such as cash deposits and withdrawals, fund transfers, bill payments, accounts opening, applying for loans and Internet banking is provided here. With the online connectivity the mobile branch has, a transaction that would be done through this branch would be updated real-time.
BOC Branch on Wheels is introduced in line with the governments objective to bring in the un-bankable population in the country to the banking stream through extending modern banking facilities to customers in remote areas and building their confidence in the banking stream. Even these modern banking facilities are hard to reach for some; the mobile branch will go up to the customer breaking psychological and geographic barriers to make banking more feasible.
Enabled as part of the digital transformation, the bank takes this initiative very seriously. To ensure that the entire country is covered, the bank will assign a mobile branch for each province. By doing so it will be able to cover wider ground area and reach a wider customer base ranging from a busy marketplace, to a school, hospital and any type of organisation or factory, at the convenience of the customer.
The branch will be deployed according to a pre-decided schedule to operate as a routine branch. It will also serve as a service station when mobilizing special events in the region. BOC also looks forward to strategically place this as part of a recovery plan to support relief operations in disaster situations to assist customers immediately in their time of need. 
Digitally altering the Sri Lankan banking landscape, BOC pioneered to elevate the countrys banking industry significantly in par with the international standards bringing a world-class banking experience to its customers. With the responsibility of a bank with a state ownership, it has spread its service across the country to cater every
Sri Lankan.

Clear picture by mid-January
	

Politics in the country appears to have run into a turbulent time with the dawn of New Year 2017.
Amid street protests and demonstrations creating a tense atmosphere, verbal duels within the yahapalanaya and talk about crossovers and resignations in the offing, have given rise to much confusion and uncertainty in the polity.

One state purohita has already quit office and there is speculation that several other state ones and deputies have decided to follow suit; four of them are about to say adieu to yahapalanaya, they say.
The foursome poised for the second round jump are said to be hailing from the Puttalam, Matale and Galle districts and are reportedly waiting for an astrologically auspicious day in the second week of this month to make the move.
The present hazy picture of the countrys political landscape will clear up soon after the 11th or the 12th of this month, informed ones say.

## Title: European Commission proposes GSP+ to SL

European Commission proposes GSP+ to SL
	
The European Commission today proposed that a significant part of the remaining import duties on Sri Lankan products should be removed by the European Union in exchange for the country's commitment to ratify and effectively implement 27 international conventions on human rights, labour conditions, protection of the environment and good governance.
Removal of customs duties would be accompanied by rigorous monitoring and conditional on continued commitment to sustainable development, human rights and good governance, European Commission said in a statement.
These one-way trade preferences would consist of the full removal of duties on 66% of tariff lines, covering a wide array of products including textiles and fisheries. 
These preferences would come under a special arrangement of the EU Generalised Scheme of Preferences, known as GSP+. This arrangement is designed to support developing countries by fostering their economic development through increased trade with Europe and providing incentives to take tangible measures towards sustainable development. The European Parliament and the Council have now up to four months to raise potential objections before the measures become effective, it said.
Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrm said: "GSP+ preferences can make a significant contribution to Sri Lanka's economic development by increasing exports to the EU market. But this also reflects the way in which we want to support Sri Lanka in implementing human rights, rule of law and good governance reforms. I am confident of seeing timely and substantial further progress in these areas and the GSP+ dialogue and monitoring features will support this reform process. This should include making Sri Lankan counter-terrorism legislation fully compatible with international human rights conventions." 
Granting access to the GSP+ scheme does not mean that the situation of the beneficiary country with respect to the 27 international conventions wass fully satisfactory.
It offered the incentive of increased trade access in return for further progress towards the full implementation of those conventions, and provides a platform for engagement with beneficiaries on all problematic areas.
As is the case for all GSP+ countries, the removal of customs duties for Sri Lanka would be accompanied with rigorous monitoring of the country's progress in the area of sustainable development, human rights and good governance, the statement added.

HDFC Bank opens new branch in Dambulla
	
Central Bank Deputy Governor Sunil Lankathilake makes the first transaction with a customer in the presence of HDFC Bank Chairman R.J. De Silva and GM/CEO Upali Hettiarachchi

HDFC Bank recently opened its 39th branch in Dambulla in line with its corporate mission to improve the living standards of the underprivileged in particular with housing and other financial facilities.
The new branch was declared open by Central Bank Deputy Governor Sunil Lankathilake in the presence of HDFC Bank Chairman Attorney-At-Law R.J. De Silva, GM/CEO Upali Hettiarachchi and members of the staff.
The new branch located near the Dambulla clock tower, Kurunegala road, Dambulla will offer a range of services to meet the needs of people in the area, including housing loans, education loans, leasing facilities and a range of small and medium enterprise (SME) banking solutions and attractive savings and fixed deposit schemes.
It will also offer Thilina childrens savings and Prathilabha general savings with competitive interest rates, Vishrama Rekawarana, a unique retirement plan that would benefit the investor with the highest interest return.
Customers will also have access to network linked ATM facilities. In addition, the newly opened branch will also offer Palm Top Banking facilities for customers, enabling them to carry out their banking transactions at the time and place most convenient for them.
Speaking at the occasion, Lankathilake said HDFC Bank serves the country in the specific field of housing finance, which is a social service as physical shelter has a significant impact on the lives of the people. He also added that according to the data from KPMG, price levels for condominium units per square foot in Sri Lanka have increased in recent years and therefore HDFC bank has a greater potential to extend its services to the people.
Expressing his views at the event, HDFC Chairman Attorney-at-Law R.J. De Silva mentioned that the bank looks forward to contribute to the governments nation building activities by providing an exceptional service that will truly benefit the people in
the area.
With the history of over 32 years, as the affordable housing finance provider to the people whose access to finance is low, HDFC Bank has a responsibility to contribute towards the social upliftment of rural and low-income masses and improve their quality of life by fulfilling the hope of permanent shelter through housing finance,
he said.
CEO/GM Upali Hettiarachchi in his speech invited the people of the area to come over to HDFC bank and experience the friendly customer service and get all the housing and other financial requirements from
one place.
Dambulla Divisional Secretary H.P.P.A. Hevapathirana, Central Bank Regional Managers Central, Eastern and North Western Regions Mahinda Saliya, J.M. Ameer and D.N.

He breathed the longest sigh of relief in life
	

The former strongman the other day attended the funeral of a family member of a politico holding a very high position in the Diyawanna council.

On arrival at the cemetery where the funeral rites were being observed, the former boss spotted a vacant chair in the front row reserved for VIPs and sat on it.
Soon after the former strongman taking the chair, a visibly much agitated security officer bent over and spoke to the latter apologetically: Sir, would you mind moving over to the vacant chair over there.
Whats wrong with this place This place is okay for me! the former strongman replied easily and resumed the conversation with the Speaker seated next to him.
The disconcerted security officer mustered some courage and addressed the former strongman again: Sir, this is the chair reserved for the Loku Mahattaya!
The former strongman replied: Now that I have sat down here. I cant move over to another place. But dont worry I am leaving shortly
Several minutes later, the news that the Loku Mahattaya had arrived ran through the crowd and the security officer who was responsible for seating the VVIP went into a panic.
However, as the VVIP walked in, the former strongman walked away from the scene.
And the security officer had later confessed to his colleagues that he heaved the longest sigh of relief in his life.

## Title: Implement CTF recommendations: HRW

Implement CTF recommendations: HRW
	
The government should promptly implement recommendations on transitional justice proposed by the Consultation Task Force (CTF), the Human Rights Watch (HRW) said today.
Issuing a statement, the HRW said the CTF report reflects the first broad survey of Sri Lankan citizens on their aspirations for truth and justice, as called for by the October 2015 resolution of the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC).
The task force report is remarkably comprehensive and clear in setting out the concerns and needs expressed by Sri Lankans across all communities on the transitional justice process, said Brad Adams, Asia director of HRW.
The government should now own the reports recommendations and set out a framework for putting them into action, in line with its pledges at the Human Rights Council, he said.
The Consultation Task Force was formally appointed in February 2016, and began receiving submissions in April 2016 on the proposed mechanisms outlined in Human Rights Council Resolution 30/1, in which the government promised to deliver justice, accountability, and reconciliation in the aftermath of Sri Lankas 26-year-long civil war. The task force, aided by civil society representatives, received 7,306 submissions from the Sinhalese, Tamil, Muslim, and other communities, as well as the security services during the course of their hearings.
The CTF concluded its consultations in August 2016. The task force reported that there had been no government interference or attempts to impede their work, and that the report reflected the views of all 11 members. In a news conference held after the reports release, CTF members noted that concerns about justice and accountability were raised both in the countrys north and south by many in all communities.
Sri Lanka is on the March 2017 agenda of the Human Rights Council, where High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Raad Al Hussein is expected to report on Sri Lankas compliance with the resolution.
This will include the governments willingness to promptly implement the CTF report recommendations.
However, the immediate response by senior officials has been disappointing. Justice Minister Wijedasa Rajapaksa and Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne both separately ruled out the participation of foreign nationals on the special court, while Finance Minister Lakshman Yapa Abeywardene said that President Maithripala Sirisena rejected the inclusion of foreign judges and would not allow the government to prosecute war heroes. The cabinet spokesperson claimed that Al Hussein had agreed that there should be no foreign involvement in the court during a previous meeting  a claim that Al Hussein himself immediately rejected.
The report recommendations also contain important confidence-building measures that the government could adopt immediately. These include a robust victim-witness protection law, meaningful outreach by the government across all communities, symbolic gestures to allow public grieving and memorialization, and a minority rights commission.
The Sri Lankan government took the bold step of agreeing to a multi-ethnic task force for broad consultations on transitional justice, Adams said.
Now that the task force has listened to the country, its crucial that the government doesnt drop its key recommendations. The government should recognize that its commitments were not only to concerned governments in Geneva, but to its own citizens seeking justice and reconciliation after a terrible war, he said.

He said partys women and youth councils and trade unions attached to the SLFP demanded that President Sirisena should be fielded as the Presidential candidate and added that however he had not expressed his views on the matter.
Minister Dissanayake told a news conference that even though he as the common candidate had vowed not to contest as the presidential candidate again, he would have to abide by the request of the party having undertaken the chairmanship of the party with the consent of the partys majority.
He said the SLFP and UNP unity government had more work to do adding that the unity government had gained a lot of victories to the country.
There are people who are opposed to the unity government both in the UNP and SLFP. I would like to tell them that we have been able to obtain many victories as a unity government, he said.
Mr. Dissanayake said there were some issues in the UNP and the SLFP unity government over several matters such as strengthening government service, privatization and foreign investments.
If we are to develop the country, eliminate poverty and resolve the issue of unemployment, we need foreign investment. We need to provide them with required facilities and lands, he said.
He said the government was planning to bring in foreign investment and factories to the country next few years. (Ajith Siriwardana)

Music Company offers Obama a job
	
Days before US President Barack Obama ends his final term at the White House, the soon-to-be unemployed world leader was already being lured by music-streaming site Spotify.
On Jan 9, the website's jobs section posted a vacancy for a "President of Playlists" position requiring "eight years experience running a highly-regarded nation" as well as a Nobel Peace Prize.
Tailored to Obama's career, the tasks include identifying new playlist ideas, "from a playlist for shooting hoops with your friends, to the perfect warm up playlist for addressing the nation about healthcare legislation that bears your name."
The US President, who has collected more than 400,000 followers on the music-streaming site since his first public playlist in August 2015, had previously joked about working at Spotify after the presidency. 
According to the wife of the US ambassador in Sweden, Obama told a gathering of diplomats that he was "still waiting" for a job at the Stockholm-based company.
"I heard you were interested in a role at Spotify. Have you seen this one" the platform's co-founder and chief executive Daniel Ek later said in a tweet to Obama.
Referring to the "birther" movement conspiracy about the president's birthplace, the "President of Playlists" post also calls for enough familiarity with the software to create an "I just found my birth certificate" playlist.
Obama, who is set to continue work on the Obama Foundation's presidential library, has yet to confirm his plans after he leaves office on Jan 20, when his successor Donald Trump, a key figure in the birther conspiracy, is inaugurated.
Obama has been an active user of Spotify since officially joining in 2015, collecting thousands of followers for his summer mixes and "Official Inauguration Playlist." (The star online)

Obtain approval for use of drones: Media Ministry
	
In the wake of the police apprehending a drone used by a TV station to cover clashes in Hambantota on Saturday (7), the Mass Media and Parliamentary Affairs Ministry today laid down guidelines and regulations on the use of drones for media purposes.
Accordingly, approval from the Director General of Civil Aviation, an approved person or approved organisation, has to be obtained for the use of pilot-less aircraft with a gross mass of between 1 kg and 25 kg.
While claiming that the regulations on the use of drones around airspace have been relaxed after the end of the war, the Mass Media Ministry says that it was aware of footage taken by drones, by citizens as well as tourists visiting Sri Lanka, widely available across social media as online video platforms. We recognise that many events today in their promotional material or live coverage feature the use of drones.
"We also note their use in health applications, precision agriculture practices (smart farming), the coverage of public rallies, the aftermath of natural disasters, around disaster risk reduction, sporting events and private functions like weddings and parties. Given the increasing availability of high-end consumer drones in Sri Lanka, the manufacture of sophisticated drones within the country and with their purchase price dropping sharply,
The Media Ministry expects their use in commercial and recreational purposes, including in the field of journalism and the Media Ministry fully supports the use of drones by journalists and media personnel in pursuit of their professional news gathering operations and coverage of events, places and processes.
However, given a rapid increase in usage and the evolving nature of drone technology, the Ministry's primary responsibility is to ensure usage of drones for journalism is in compliance with existing rules and regulations, as well as conducted in a manner that is, above all else, safe, ethical and respects the privacy of citizens.
In this respect, media reports over recent months, from coverage around the exhumation of slain journalist Lasantha Wickrematunge's body in Colombo to the coverage of the unrest in Hambantota recently, have focused on the use of drones by media organizations and raised questions around regulations, ethics and professionalism.

PM's Constitutional Proposals based on my draft in 2000: CBK
	
Former president Chandrika Kumaratunga said yesterday Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe is to introduce a new Constitution based on the Constitutional draft presented by her in Parliament in 2000 but defeated by the then UNP.
It was defeated in Parliament by those who thought I will become very popular if my attempts to bring peace and stability to the country through a new Constitution had succeeded, she said.
She told a media conference at the Strategic Enterprise Management Agency (SEMA) auditorium that the SLFP had not taken a decision to continue with the Executive Presidency and the media reports to that effect were incorrect.
Ms. Kumaratunga who is also a Patron of the SLFP said a decision against the abolishing of the Executive Presidency must be taken by the SLFP Central Committee (CC). She said the Unity Government in its election campaign in 2015 had pledged to abolish the Executive Presidency and confirmed that the CC had not decided to continue with the Executive Presidency.
When asked by Daily Mirror about the Reconciliation Mechanism as recommended in the Consultation Task Force (CTF) report handed over to her last Tuesday by its Chairman Manohari Muttetuwegama in its report recomending a hybrid court and foreign judges in the panel inquiring into allegations of war crimes, Ms. Kumaratunga said the government could not reject the CTF recommendations outright.
State Minister of Finance, Lakshman Yapa Abeywardana told the media last Friday that President Maithripala Sirisena would not agree to foreign judges in a domestic legal mechanism to probe allegations of human rights violations. The Justice Minister also rejected the CTF recommendations.
However, Ms. Kumaratunga conceded that the recommendations were not binding and open for public debate. The report was prepared by representatives of professionals and NGOs. The government must try to implement the recommendations that are not controversial.
The government must study the report and its recommendations closely and subject it to a public debate before taking a decision, she stressed.
She said she had done much during her Presidency to start peace talks with the LTTE, to stop the war and bring peace and reconciliation to the country. But extremists in the North and South disrupted her efforts.(Sandun A Jayasekera)

The Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe should not heed to any request from anyone to intervene in the case of Joint Opposition MP Wimal Weerawansa who was arrested, Deputy Minister Ranjan Ramanayake said on Tuesday.
Mr. Ramanayake told media that the Prime Minister may get phone calls requesting that he should intervene in the case but should not respond to those.
People of this country expected President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe to be tough leaders such as the current Pilipino President Rodrigo Duterte who push down drug dealers from flying helicopters, but our President and Prime Minister are not that tough and allow legal proceeding to move against wrong doers, he said.
If they act like President Duterte they will have to push down at least 175 members of Parliament out of the total 225 from flying helicopters, he added.
Further he said even those government politicians who are engaged in corruption should be dealt with.
The government should deal with corruption in the same way in which late Fidel Castro dealt with Arnaldo Ochoa Sanchez who was charged with various crimes and drug smuggling, Mr Ramanayake added.(Yohan Perera and Tilakaratne Dissanayake)

One of the duo - a member from Wellassa area confiding his financial  woes to Number One had promised to throw in his lot with yahapalanaya if he were to be offered at least a Deputy job so that he could get out of his present difficulties.
The other member who met the Number One was a charming fair one. She too had confessed that she was going through many hardships and a Deputy post would help her keep her head above water.
The Number One had agreed to consider their requests, but had failed to give an assurance leaving them in a state of suspense and anxiety, they say.

Reflections on the state of the nation
	
Maithripala Sirisena, elected the 6th executive President of Sri Lanka on January 8, 2015, was the victor over a highly popular and seemingly invincible opponent. Nevertheless, it was a victory of the people of Sri Lanka, as President Sirisena himself has often said. It became a peoples victory because the battle was between a political ideal and a personality.
Ranil Wickremesinghe, for example, had to sacrifice what in retrospect seems to have been a good chance for him to be president. He made way for a man who had a decidedly better chance of defeating Mahinda Rajapaksa, a strongman president with a cult following. Maithripala Sirisena had to take an enormous risk in coming forward. He, perhaps more than anyone else, knew the consequences of a possible defeat having seen the trials and tribulations that Sarath Fonseka had to suffer in 2010 after failing to dislodge incumbent Rajapaksa at the January 2010 presidential race. Dissident Sirisena took a risk that few in this world would have taken and deserves all the accolades that followed his victory. 
Nevertheless, it was not his victory alone. Every single individual who openly supported the Sirisena candidacy was taking an enormous risk. The vindictiveness of the previous regime, after all, was not a secret. Prominent representatives of civil society, led of course by the late Ven Maduluwawe Sobitha Thero, leaders of political parties and other political organizations including trade unions, professionals, academics and media personalities rose to the occasion. Most importantly, the crucial votes came from people who decided that ending decades-long terrorism did not give the incumbent a license for perpetual and corrupt rule. The anti-Rajapaksa bloc vote was also necessary to deliver the January 2015 outcome. 
I remember that day very well. On election day, as I left home, my wife asked me the question that probably troubled many who voted for Maithripala Sirisena: What if Mahinda Rajapaksa wins 
I told her that he would be defeated but that he might not leave office in a hurry. It was a concern that was shared by many. It was a justified fear of people in our families due to what we had to suffer during the previous regime. There were many who were forced to leave the country. Even some Sri Lankan expatriates were scared to be seen in the company of political refugees from home fearing a backlash from the Rajapaksa regime. The general attitude could be summed up this way: if Mahinda doesnt like you, please understand, we cannot be associated with you in any way. It was not only high profile individuals like Sarath Fonseka and the former Chief Justice, Shirani Bandaranayake, who invited the wrath of the Rajapaksas. There were many ways in which critics of the regime could be made to pay and indeed most of them were made to pay dearly for the choices they made.

First and foremost, then, the January 8th result made my wifes question irrelevant. Importantly and happily President Maithripala Sirisena did not engage in the kind of witch-hunt that his opponent in all likelihood would have carried out had the outcome been different. It was clear from the outset that the rule of law had another chance in this country. 
It is now two years since that historic peoples victory. Anniversaries of significant political moments naturally call for retrospect. The time that has passed is often described in terms of progress made. The delivery of promises made or otherwise is assessed. Errors are enumerated. Recommendations for rectification are proposed along with blue-prints for the way forward. 
What was Sri Lanka immediately before the 8th of January, 2015 I believe it was a sick patient. I believe it was a patient plagued by multiple and near-fatal ailments. It was a patient battered, bruised and bleeding from multiple and life-threatening injuries. It was, however, a patient that was well dressed to hide the wounds and one that had a face so heavily and even artistically made up. The first impression was of a person in the pink of health. Pretence can hold up only for so long. The decaying body gives out foul odours. They break through all cosmetics. The truth was ready to emerge and emerge it did in the form of a telling electoral defeat for the Rajapaksa regime. 
This is what the new government inherited. It was tasked to treat and revive a dying patient. Maithripala Sirisena and Ranil Wickremesinghe were charged with bringing back to health a patient who had been poisoned and thereafter treated by quack doctors who dealt with symptoms and not the disease, who used bandages to cover up wounds without treating them. Truth be told, even the physicians thus tasked learned of the true nature of the ailments only much later. Perhaps this is why, two years later, Maithripala Sirisenas manifesto and the time-frame that the new dispensation set out for itself appear to have been over-ambitious. 

Sri Lankas prognosis 
It is in this context that one must assess performance. The problem of inaccurate assessment of a patients condition is that it leads to expectations that are unrealistic. For example, you cannot expect a fast bowler who has had knee-surgery to perform at full pace immediately after leaving hospital. Indeed he would need several weeks or months of therapy to get back to full fitness. 
Sri Lankas case is far worse. As mentioned, the patient had multiple ailments, some of which were evident in part by symptoms and some which were hidden or at least not easily identified. It is as though the patient had high cholesterol, was a chronic diabetic, had several malignancies and had been kicked in his kidneys, had a couple of ribs broken and also been shot in the leg. Expecting the patient to walk out of hospital after a couple of pain-killers would be a tall order indeed. Expecting the patient to run a marathon is absolutely out of the question. 
However, it has to be remembered that the conditions are not untreatable. Proper medication, proper therapy and proper care can do the job. In this, the government can count some successes but also has to acknowledge failures. Some drugs dont work on some patients and wrong prescriptions are not unheard of in the medical profession. However, we are not talking about the right leg being amputated when it is the left leg that needed to be removed. The mistakes that have been made are not irreversible. 
It is no easy task to revive a collapsed economy, restore a failing democracy and bring about reconciliation and national unity. Each of these, even if they had to be dealt with separately, would have been tough. This government has had to attend to all these simultaneously. Naturally there has been more progress in certain areas while successes on other fronts have been modest. 
The best performance has been in the sphere of democratization. The 19th Amendment, which curtailed the powers of the president, strikingly with the full support of the very man who enjoyed the near dictatorial powers, was a significant achievement. It also included the setting up of independent commissions on multiple subjects. The Right to Information Act, likewise, was a significant achievement. The true benefits of these measures will no doubt take some time to be fully appreciated. They seek to change the anti democratic culture that has plagued this country, a condition which was ironically constitutionally enshrined. Politicians as well as the general citizenry are yet to fully understand the potential of these changes. No doubt, in time, their reference and subsequent application and the inherent empowerment will be realized. Already weve seen how the space for criticism has expanded. Due process in all matters is slowly but surely becoming a reality. If electoral reforms are instituted as per the promised 20th Amendment, democracy will well and truly be on the path to full recovery. 
The economy is decidedly a more delicate matter. It has been unfortunately marked by indiscipline. Almost everything has been framed by the self-serving needs of those in high places of power. The politicization of anything and everything didnt make the country investor-friendly. Foreign relations being at an all-time low didnt help either. To put it in a nutshell, the economy was on its last legs. In contrast to democratizing reforms, an economy cannot be turned around by edict. There are things that can be controlled and things that are out of the hands of the men and women in charge, in this case global factors. The medicine can be bitter and the surgery painful. There are no magic injections that will set things right overnight. Gains on one front often coincide with losses on another. It is inevitably a slow and painful process. Establishing fiscal discipline can cause a lot of discomfort. Rooting out corruption and cronyism is not an easy task either. Gains have been made but the destination is still quite a distance. 
The same can be said of the reconciliation process. The most important difference has been in the area of trust. A space for dialogue has been created and this can only grow with democratic reforms. It has been established now that there are no winners in a conflict and that reconciliation is about building trust and building on trust to build partnerships. Unity never comes cheap. It is never a quick fix. It takes time to forge. The forging instruments are now in the hands of the people. 
Yes, the people. They made this change possible. If the government is considered to be a team of physicians, then all the institutions and all the people including members of the government in their personal capacities must be considered the patient that we referred to above. The body must also fight and be a partner in the process of healing. A patient that is in the dark about the ailments is not an ally but in fact can rebel against the process of recovery and even be an enemy to himself or herself. 
Communication challenge 
This, I believe, is the biggest failure of the government. The true nature of the tasks at hand has not been communicated to the people. The people still expect quick fixes to the plethora of ailments. They want to be up and running, not realizing that the track is not yet ready and the preparation is still in its initial stage which, as always, is slow and involves a lot of hard work, patience and understanding. 
Of course it is easier to market cosmetics as opposed to ill-health. Bad news does not make anyone happy. However, the truth has to be communicated and communicated effectively. This is something this government has failed to do. Ironically, it is almost as if the government is scared to tell the truth to the very people that brought it to power. 
This country will not be ready for economic take-off over the next few days. People will not be waking up tomorrow to find peace and prosperity at their doorsteps. The government has to revisit the period preceding January 2015 and remember that the electoral victory was possible because the people believed there could be change. That belief was reconfirmed in August 2015. Mahinda Rajapaksas sway over the media did not stop the people from thinking independently, being critical and acting out on their perceptions. 
Even as the government moves on democratization, economic rebuilding and reconciliation, it has to work as hard on communicating the hard truths relevant to all these processes. The government has to believe that the people can still believe in the government. 
The marathon can be run, this is certain. After two years, only light jogging is possible. Given all the obstacles that this government inherited and given the incompetency it is saddled with in part due to a long-standing human resource crisis in the country, we will not see things in full stride in the short-term. It is reasonable to predict that things will be clearer and better by the year 2020, but for this to happen, important steps have to be taken right now, that is in the year 2017, to correct the correctible errors, get things back on track and above all to be brutally honest about everything to the people. This is because it was a peoples victory that we saw in January 2015. The people deserve to know the truth and in fact progress is clearly possible only if the people know the truth and decide to support progressive efforts simply because they feel empowered by the fact that they have been taken into confidence. 
January 2015 was a peoples victory. Sustaining the gains clearly depends on whether or not the people remain with the government. They will be if they believe they are partners of the forces that they brought to power. Making them continue to believe is the challenge. It is a challenge that has two distinct components: getting the job done and keeping the people informed of all aspects of the process at all times.

Release drone video: Dullas
	
The Joint Opposition today challenged the police and the government to release the video footage of the seized-and-then-released drone camera belonging to a TV station so that the people could witness who cast the first stone at whom during the Saturdays protest in Hambantota.
JO National Organiser MP Dullas Alahapperuma said the memory chip of the drone camera had been corroded by the police to destroy evidence.
I request people not to believe us simply because we say it was the thugs, who were under police protection, threw stones at us first or not to believe the government which says it was us who threw the first stone. I invite them to see what was recorded from the drone camera. In order to do that, the police should release the footage, the MP told a news conference.
He accused the police of claiming that the monks who were present at the event were simply robe-bearers and the protesters had attempted to launch an attack on government leaders present at the inauguration of the Southern Industrial Zone.
All these accusations come after destroying evidence. If can, the police should show the footage of the drone camera to the country without misleading the people, he said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

RTI Act comes into force on Feb.3: Gayantha
	
Right to Information (RTI) Act would be fully operative from February 3 enabling people to obtain any information from the government, Mass Media Minister Gayantha Karunathilaka said yesterday.
The Minister said this at a special meeting with Information Commission Chairman, committee members and media ministry members at the parliament premises yesterday.
As promised by this government to bring in the Right to Information (RTI) Act before it came to power it had taken steps to present the Right to Information Bill in Parliament on August 4 last year and it was passed with a massive 255 votes, the Minister said.
Accordingly, every citizen in the country will get their right to know the information they need from any government institution.
A Five members Right to Information (RTI) Commission was formed under former Ministry Secretary Mahinda Gammanpila, who was appointed as the Chairman of the Commission by the President on last September. S. Punchihewa, former judge A.W.A. Salam, Social Scientist S. Thiruchandran and Kishali Pinto Jayawardena had been appointed as the members of the Commission.
However, some information prejudicial to the national security, national economy, examinations, foreign trade agreement negotiations, personnel details, details of medical reports would have restrictions, the Minister said.
For example you cant demand the breakdown of arms and ammunition of the Army. You can't ask how many multi- barrel rockets the army has etc. Those details are not supposed to be revealed. You cant ask a doctor about his treatment for a particular patient. That is the privacy of the patient. You cant ask premature disclosure of foreign trade agreements, he said.
People can obtain their details in three languages, the minister said. (Chaturanga Pradeep)

Steering by stars
	

Prominent astrologers here and in India are said to be having brisk business these days. Their clients are mostly our leading politicos anxious to take a peek into their future given the major planetary change due to take place on the 26th of this month which is expected to make a far reaching impact both on individuals and on the countrys political scene.

Politicos who have found that the major celestial event portends ill for them are seeking the help of the occult experts to counter the malefic influence. Meanwhile, those who have been assured of an auspicious time ahead are jockeying for political power and high positions, they say.
By the way, a very high political authority in yahapalanaya has reportedly been assured of a favourable period after the 16th of this month and a much better time after the 26th celestial event. Meanwhile, a big gun in the opposition is also said to be in a buoyant mood following an assurance by an astrologer that the malefic period that saw him down and out would end on January 26 marking the dawn of a very favourable time ahead.
All in all, astrological guidance and predictions are going to be a major factor in shaping the significant political events about to come, they say.

Three minds and three different forms
	


Interactions, The three-person art exhibition held recently at the Harold Pieris art gallery, offered an interesting perspective of three very different creative impulses, combining the paintings, drawings, installations and photography of Sidath Perera, Yanthi Lebbe and Eric Suriyasena. 
Through his acrylic paintings and pen and ink drawings, Sidath Perera offered a window into a voluptuous world of suppressed fantasy and desire. His works consist of nudes and voyeur male figures, hinting at a subterranean world of creature comforts bent on feasting the senses. However, this sensuality is kept in check by muted colours  the lushness which might have recalled the tropical paradise of Paul Gauguin is not there, as if the artist held himself in check. 
Eric Suriyasena offers a world of sensuous colour and harmonious design in keeping with traditional motifs and design configurations. They offer a sense of peace and harmony, with no hint of conflict. They are mostly large designs best viewed from a distance, creating a sense of tranquility through the viewers eye and mind. 
Yanthi Lebbes work differs markedly from the other two artists. Her works include photographs as well. It is mostly monochrome, a condition which, as the artist puts it, came about as the result of personal grief and a deep sense of loss. But there is a sensuous feel about her black and white which overcomes the limitations of these two colours. 
Her mixed media installation Human Interaction examines the evolution of ideas and matter as they evolve. The artist uses the term metamorphosis to describe this process, as evolve suggests a more mundane, everyday cycle of renewal and decay. 
The idea that broken objects can have a new lease of life, more attractive in form than before, is expressed through the ancient Japanese ceramic technique of Kintsuki/kinsukurai whereby broken ceramic is mended bonding them and painting them with gold or silver lacquer. The artist also uses illustrations from Lewis Carolls Alice in Wonderland -- the well-known Mad Hatters Tea Party episode  to explore the interaction between emotions, its cause and the chaos created by it. 
But her most striking work was a relatively small black and white photograph, taken of her own leg looking down from a seated position. Its a good example of creating an abstract design from an everyday situation and objects, drawing the eye to a focusing point (the artists foot) through several layers consisting of folds, black and white dots and enigmatic shapes.

A high-up of a statutory body looking after air traffic had presented a New Year gift with a difference to their purohita at the top table.

Believe it or not! The gift was a large stock of footwear!
This state-run body had been in the thick of flood relief activity in the past and this stock of footwear accounts for a collection received as donations from the public which the white-collar bigwigs had failed to distribute among the flood victims. They had later decided to present the entire stock lying idle to the Deputy purohita. However, the purohita of the top team, on hearing about the proposed move had told the white collar ones that he could put the stock to good use.
By the way, the purohitas constituents in cool climes will receive these footwear as gifts shortly, they say.
