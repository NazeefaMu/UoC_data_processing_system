The segment from Welipenna to Kurundugahahetekma on the Southern Expressway (E01) would be closed from 1.00 a.m. to 3.00 a.m. tomorrow due to a removal of a toppled container truck, the police said.

Govt. planning to appoint incompetent AG: Gammanpila
	
The government is planning to appoint an incompetent official to the post of Attorney General in the wake of the retirement of former AG Yuwanjan Wijeyatilake, Pivithuru Hela Urumaya (PHU) General Secretary and MP Udaya Gammanpila claimed today.
He said the new AG should be appointed as soon as possible because otherwise the lawsuits filed under the purview of the AG can no longer be proceeded with.
Mr. Gammanpila said Solicitor General Suhada Gamlath who earlier functioned as the acting AG should be appointed to the post according to the approved selection procedure.
Solicitor General Gamlath who is next in line should be appointed soon. He is a reputed and competent state official who works independently on behalf of justice. He is not relying on money or any other benefits. But, according to reports, an officer who is incapable of serving as the AG is to be appointed, he said.
He said the joint opposition would oppose the appointment of an outsider to the post of AG. (Piyumi Fonseka)

HSBC Sri Lanka becomes first foreign bank to join LankaPays CEFTS
	
HSBC has become the first foreign bank to join the Common Electronic Fund Transfer Switch (CEFTS) launched by LankaPay, the national payment network operated by LankaClear (Pvt) Ltd.
The system is launched under the guidance of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka to offer customers of its member banks the convenience and flexibility to make inward and outward fund transfers at a nominal fee in real time, 24/7, 365 days of the year.
CEFTS is a cost-effective, convenient, integrated electronic payment gateway, whereby HSBC customers can avail several benefits with maximum banking convenience and effective management of their
finances as follows;
- Personal banking and Corporate banking clients can receive funds from CEFTS member banks up to Rupees 5 million per transaction
- Outward remittances from HSBC can be made via HSBCs Personal Internet Banking (PIB) service up to a third party transaction limit of rupees 2.5 million and can be increased up to rupees 5 million
on request.
The service will no doubt be a value addition with the existing methods; SLIPS and Real Time Gross Settlements (RTGS) currently being enjoyed by customers, with its unique faster transferability of funds.
While appreciating the customer-centric approach taken by HSBC, LankaClear General Manager / CEO Channa de Silva stated We are extremely elated to welcome HSBC, established more than 120 years ago in Sri Lanka, into our revolutionary real-time payment system CEFTS. It is an extremely convenient, yet cost effective, integrated electronic payment system of the national payment network, LankaPay. CEFTS facilitates secure real-time payments, where the recipient will receive the funds within a fraction of a second. This is another gigantic step forward taken by HSBC in moving the population of Sri Lanka towards a cashless society. With CEFTS we can offer greater flexibility to our corporate clients where they can now receive payments from counter parties 24/7. The system further strengthens HSBCs receivables proposition while offering the added capability of receiving funds into a virtual account, enabling efficient reconciliation. 
commented Chamira Wijetilleke, Head of Corporate Banking, HSBC Sri Lanka and Maldives. Capitalising on its digital banking capabilities, HSBCs award winning internet banking platform is built on world-class technology with the assurance of high security. It is also equipped to perform a number of banking services. Furthermore, with state of the art security features and fraud prevention systems, customers can be rest assured that their money is secure
and safe.
Nilantha Bastian, Head of Retail Banking and Wealth Management said, We are pleased to join LankaPay  CEFTS and enable customers to facilitate secure real time payments from anywhere at any time they wish, through their personal banking account, using HSBCs Personal Internet Banking service. As a leading foreign bank in the country, we have remained committed to developing world-class solutions through our personal internet banking service. This is evident by the awards we have won for Best Internet Bank by Global Finance since 2006 to 2015. We hope customers will continue to enjoy a speedier and seamless payment process through CEFTS.
HSBC has been at the forefront of innovation and led the banking industry into the digital age with many firsts, such as ATMs, Easy Pay machines, 24/7 Day & Night banking centres and internet banking to make banking more accessible. HSBC has also been recognized as the best cash management bank in Sri Lanka by Euromoney for five consecutive years, including last year.

Joint opposition submits protest letter to UNHR chief
	
The joint opposition today submitted a letter to be handed over to visiting UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Zeid Raad Al Hussein.
The letter, signed by party leaders of the joint opposition was made available to the media. It says the Office of High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) has prepared a report containing a number of serious allegations against the armed forces.
The latter part of the report states that there are reasonable grounds to believe that the armed forces can be held liable for war crimes. Referring to this matter, the joint opposition says such conclusions carrying the gravest possible consequences in international law based on the evidence given on condition of anonymity.
The letter states that the intensity of pressure applied on Sri Lankan, compared with the countries that experienced similar crisis situations, has no rational justification. Asserting that the report prepared by the OHCHR goes beyond its mandate, the joint opposition calls it intrusive.
In its letter, the joint opposition opposed the provision in the UNHRC resolution to involve the participation of foreign judges, prosecutors and investigators.
There is a lack of even handed treatment in dealing with the atrocities committed by the LTTE. This is made clear, for instance by the preposterous finding that there is no evidence indicating that the LTTE used hospitals and other health facilities in the North against which military action was taken, the letter states.

President should reveal his stance on Malabe Hospital- IUSF
	
The Inter-University Students Federation (IUSF) today said President Maithripala Sirisena should make a statement regarding his stance on the offer made by the Chairman of the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM) in Malabe, Dr. Neville Fernando to use his Dr. Neville Fernando Teaching Hospital (NFTH) as a semi-government hospital.
Without making statements regarding irrelevant matters just like the controversial incident happened in some pop music concert held last December, the Presidents concern should be paid for important matters because of what the general public is distressed over many years.
President Sirisena has previously accepted the NFTH as a teaching hospital when he was serving as the Minister of Health in 2011. But, after the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) refuted to recognize the NFTH as a teaching hospital in 2012, the President had told Parliament that the NFTH could not be accepted, the IUSF Convener Lahiru Weerasekara said.
Dr. Neville Fernando has said the decision was made by him after realizing that poor patients, who come for treatment to his hospital, could not afford to pay for hospital charges. We are keen to ask him whether he did not feel sorry when Kaveeshas family was begging to get Kaveesha's body when they failed to pay the charges on time to the NFTH. We are urging the President not to attempt to guard Dr. Fernando by accepting his plea, Lahiru Weerasekara said.
He said the letter which has been sent by Dr. Neville Fernando to the President with regard to his offer, should be put into the dustbin. (Piyumi Fonseka and Darshana Sanjeewa)

There is peace in the Country: Mahanayake to UNHR Chief
	
Malwatte Chapter Mahanayake Thera the Most Ven. Tibbatuwave Siddhartha Sri Sumangala Thera has told visiting UN Human Rights High Commissioner Prince Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein that the present government was striving hard to bring about reconciliation in the country.
The UNHR Chief visited the Kandy Dalada Maligawa today and after paying homage to the sacred tooth relic he paid a courtesy call on the Mahanayake Thera.
The prelate welcomed the UNHR Chief and asked whether there existed any concerns of human rights violations because the present government was striving hard to establish peace and reconciliation among all communities.
"Our President had even gone to the extent of pardoning the very person who planned to assassinate him," the prelate said.
He said the people were confident that the President and the Prime Minister would act justifiably.
In the aftermath of a war which lasted more than 25 years it is difficult to regain normalcy in two years. The President and the Prime Minister have regularly interacted with the northern people and check on the the facilities provided to them. I am happy to note that both of them are discharging their duties very well. I request the UN to give its full support to both of them, the Mahanayake Thera said.
He said all sticking points could be resolved through a dialogue through a mechanism of our own.
"Today there is much work done on bringing about peace and reconciliation in our country. The Sinhala, Tamil and Muslim communities live peacefully, a fact which augers well for the development of our country and we are happy about it," the Mahanayake said.
UNHR Chief Prince Al Hussein said he travelled to many countries before visiting Sri Lanka and that it was essential for our nation comprising several ethnic groups to maintain unity. (J. A. L. Jayasinghe)

UNP Working Committee to be reorganized
	
The working committee of the United National Party ( UNP) and its headquarters Sirikotha will be re-organized, the Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe informed some members of the party on Saturday.
Speaking at a meeting of UNP members in Kuliyapitiya, Mr. Wickremesinghe said some members should work full time to promote the party. The party wont last if every member of it gets involved with the government, he said.
Accordingly, he said a new programme will be carried out to promote the party in the village level. He said the approval of the working committee will be sought for all the new moves.
Recalling the past he said UNP founder leader created a revolution by bringing independence to the country while late Prime Minister S. W. R. D. Bandaranaike created a social revolution and finally late President J. R Jayewardene created a revolution of modernization. Recalling that President Maithripala Sirisenas Independence Day speech where he talked of cultural children and technological children, the Prime Minister said the time had come for a fourth revolution of taking the country towards technological and competitive era.
It is not possible for a single political party to take the country towards technological era and thats why we decided to form a national government, he said stressing the need for safeguarding it.
He therefore said President Sirisena will guide the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) towards achieving this common goal.
Hitting out at the Joint Opposition, he said this group had gone into the extent of dashing coconuts to sabotage the government. At least dash one million coconuts so that the prices of coconuts would increase and the people of North Western Province could benefit from it, he added.(Yohan Perera and Anula Weeraratne)
