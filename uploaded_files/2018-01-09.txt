Blood Bank warns of a possible blood shortage
	
The National Blood Transfusion Service (NBTS) today warned of a possible blood shortage in the coming months and requested well-wishers to donate blood to avoid such a situation.
NBTS Director Dr. Rukshan Bellana said their stock of blood was running low and it could be difficult to continue with the service if a dengue epidemic or a similar situation occurred.
He said each year from January to April there was a huge shortfall in the number of donors and it was a struggle for the blood bank to finding donors. Therefore, he requested the public to visit the blood collection centres at the nearest hospital or the National Blood Transfusion Service in Narahenpita and donate blood.
There are 107 blood-collection centres located across the island and the NBTS also stands ready to provide a mobile blood collection service if anyone was interested in collecting collect the minimum amount of blood required.
For further details donors can contact the National Blood Transfusion Service via hotline 011-236991/34. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

Bond report - Without copies debate sure to fizzle out: NFF
	
National Freedom Front (NFF) MP Jayantha Samaraweera asked how the parliamentarians could debate on the bond commission report without knowing its contents because none of them were given copies of the report.
He told a media conference that no worthwhile debate could be held without sufficient information about the matter at hand.
?The information we have gathered is from the excerpts divulged by President Maithripala Sirisena during his special statement on the bond report. Some ministers may have gathered information from different sources but we can?t rely on such information on such a crucial matter,? the MP said and added that the government should not hesitate to punish those implicated in the commission report handed over to the President.

Germany?s Angela Merkel said she was optimistic her conservatives and the centre-left Social Democrats could join forces as they started talks on forming a new government and reviving the ?grand coalition?.??
It marked an attempt to break an impasse more than three months after the country?s election.??
Mrs Merkel?s conservative Union bloc and the Social Democrats have run Germany together for the past four years.But the Social Democrats vowed to go into opposition after a disastrous election result on September 24, and only reluctantly reconsidered after Mrs Merkel?s attempt to build a coalition with two smaller parties collapsed in November.? ?The effort to form a government has already become post-Second World War Germany?s longest.The week of meetings between Merkel?s conservative alliance and the Social Democrats will examine whether both sides have enough common ground to begin formal coalition negotiations towards a new government by March or April.? ?As she arrived at the SPD?s headquarters for the meeting Mrs Merkel said: ?I am going into these talks with optimism.

Govt. allies should work together: PM
	
Allies in the National Government should work together in overcoming obstacles it faces when delivering what it pledged to deliver, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said today.
?I thank all those who placed trust on us and on President Maithripala Sirisena on January 8, 2015. We are committed to deliver what we pledged three years ago. The allies of the government should get together in celebrating what we have achieved but to overcome obstacle that lay before us when delivering what we promised to the people,? he said in a special statement.
Mr. Wickremesinghe said the government is still committed to bring those who use violence to terrorize the media. ?Over nine years have passed since the killing of Sunday Leader Editor Lasantha Wickrematunge and three years since the national government came into power. We pledged to bring those who use violence against media to book and we are still committed to it,? he added.
He recalled that editorial which Mr.Wickrematunge wrote stating that he was writing it while knowing that the death is in his doorstep. He recalled how the former regime handled the media. ?Lasantha said People will get to know about the nature of the regime when his children lose their father,? the Prime Minister recalled.
Mr. Wickremesinghe said there is much to achieve though this government has been able to take the executive from the clutches of one family.
?We were battling to release the public servants who had become slaves for just one family and against the suppressing of media using killer squads,? he also said.
He said the government has been able to bring in Right to information Act to ensure the people?s right to know vital information while ensuring the rights of victims who have been subjected to crime.
?The government has managed to reactivate the 17th Amendment to the Constitution and to maintain the independence of judiciary,? he said.

## Title: Guide to Vertigo A steadying hand for a  dizzying topic

Guide to Vertigo A steadying hand for a  dizzying topic
	
Consultant ENT surgeon Dr. Chandra Jayasuriya recently co-authored a book on Vertigo with Senior Registrar at the National Hospital of Sri Lanka ENT Dr. Bimantha Perera. This article is a review of the book, ?Guide to Vertigo?.?
Vertigo is one of the commonest complaints made by patients visiting an ENT clinic. When it comes to a scientific literature, medical literature is a vast genre, with a history extending back to 1600 BC. These books, carrying information regarding various diseases and treatment methods from various civilizations, including witchcraft, gradually evolved parallel to the advancement of medicine over the years. Today they are an essential and an inevitable part of any person in the field of medicine.? ? To categorize broadly, this genre includes books that provide you with some information on a whole area of specialty, and the books that are more ?specialized?, addressing a certain topic; a disease or a symptom for an example, in depth. Majority of the latter kind, targeting specialists and specialist trainees as their focus, are written using technical terms and a complex manner that even doctors find it incredibly difficult to understand, let alone general population.??
That is why ?Guide to Vertigo? by Dr. Chandra Jayasuriya and Dr. Bimantha Perera stands out among many other of its genre, and even on the same topic, with its deviation from the norm. The simple language makes it possible even for a non- medical person to understand the condition and it?s specific, while the detailed information on every imaginable aspect of vertigo makes it an extremely handy guide to medical personals, starting from undergraduates, doctors and specialty trainees. As Senior Consultant Neurologist Deshamanya Widyajothi Dr. J.B Peris, states in the prologue, the book ?Is a useful companion to the family physician, and also specialists in neurology, ophthalmology and otology?.? ?The authors explain, in an understandable manner, the normal anatomy and physiology of maintaining the body?s balance and what vertigo is, later connecting the two to explain to the reader exactly where the normal function could fail to give rise to the condition called vertigo. The important points of the patient?s history and examination are described with the use of photographs clearly and concisely.??
Not only do the authors give the cause for vertigo, they go in to details on how to arrive at a definitive diagnosis by excluding other causes and how to treat the specific conditions afterwards.??
Consultant ENT surgeon Dr. Chandra Jayasuriya,( MBBS, DLO, MS (ORLHNS), FRCS (Edin), ), who is the main author of this book conducts the vertigo clinic at the National Hospital of Sri Lanka. She has a special interest in the area of Vertigo and has attended numerous local and international conferences on vertigo, both as a delegate and a resource person. She is reputed among the post graduate trainees as well as the medial students as a great teacher and a mentor.

I will gladly go before a bond commission: Cabraal
	
Central Bank?s former governor Ajith Nivard Cabraal said yesterday he would gladly go before a presidential commission if such a commission was set up to probe alleged bond irregularities from 2008 to 2014.
?If there is commission that the Prime Minister wants to set up, please tell me I will go before it. I will be at my home, the address of which is known. I?m not from Singapore but from Colombo,? he said.
Mr. Cabraal said he hoped there would be commissions to probe the ?Australian issue?, the alleged central expressway frauds and the fertilizer crisis.
He told a news briefing said if there was a single fraud during the time he was the CB governor, the Prime Minister would have taken action.
?If there were such issues during my time, I should have been in jail now. The issue is who should take responsibility for this bond scam? Can anyone find Arjuna Mahendran today? Is he even in Sri Lanka,? he asked.
Mr. Cabraal rejected allegations that large scale frauds relating to Bond transactions had taken place during his tenure saying the allegations were baseless.
?On August 19, 2016 the then finance minister Ravi Karunanayake requested the President for a report of Bond transactions from 2008 to 2014. The report was given on January 16, 2017. The report clearly states there was nothing wrong. I request the President to go through this document,? he said.

It?s free timber, but the big mansion is still a wonder
	
?
Administrations come and go like water under a bridge, but this highly academically qualified commissioner remains in his seat like the bridge.
?
He is putting up a multi-storey mansion these days. And obtaining timber necessary for the construction work poses no problem to him. Because there are large trees in the city which pose a threat to life and property for they could get uprooted by gale-force winds at any time in these days of freak weather. So they are cut down to spare the highway-users and road-side residents impending risk to their lives.
Some employees express wonder how the commissioner could afford to put up such a massive mansion with his monthly salary even if the necessary timber is readily available. However, that is none of their business, they concede.

On getting that  ?culture?   right
	
Just the other day I came across an amazing comment on Facebook. The commenter had argued that Sri Lankans, to be specific Sinhala Buddhists, were too apathetic to bother with economic issues and were busier with racist issues. In other words, ?keeping their strength relative to other ethnic groups? was our overriding concern.?
It was a vicious circle that results from this fixation with racial superiority, since leaders, who naturally pander to the numerical majority, affirm chauvinism to ensure the votes that keep them in power. This sadly results in leaders who think of economics as a peripheral concern, something that aggravates, again, the culture of apathy to economic issues the Sinhala Buddhist collective prefer to ignore. Made me smile. And not?because I disagree.??
But then I don?t think it?s just economics the Sinhala Buddhists are apathetic to. And I don?t really think we are apathetic to economics. If the writings of Fernand Braudel are anything to go by (given that he was the 20th century?s foremost historian), economics is largely a product of culture, and culture is dependent on a horde of other factors, prime among them the geography, the climate, the demographics, of a collective, a country, or even an entire region.?
If at all, then, we are apathetic to what makes us. To what shapes us and allows us to evolve. To what we are and what we eventually become. In one word, to our own culture. Since I am no expert on economics by any stretch of the imagination, I think it?s valid at this point to ponder on that Facebook comment and concentrate on its validity for a related field; the evolution of cultural standards and how we take them in.??
?
The purists would want to see a return to a largely distant past. The hybridists would want to see a fusion brought about in those various art forms and cultural spheres
The purists?
The cultural discourse in Sri Lanka is mostly divided between the purists on the one hand and the hybridists on the other. Whatever the art form ? cinema, theatre, literature, dance, music ? thrives therefore on a never-ending debate between these two. The purists would want to see a return to a largely distant past or an idealisation thereof. The hybridists would want to see a fusion brought about in those various art forms and cultural spheres. This is really another version of that debate between art and entertainment, between what preaches, what enthralls, what teaches, and what satiates, what satisfies and what keeps you happy. Based on that standard Amaradeva is to be put up on a pedestal and baila, the most hybrid cultural borrowing we can claim to in the realm of music, is to be degraded. Without taking sides in this tentative debate, I would like to suggest that both sides are wrong. Collectives never flourish through purism, nor do they prosper when hybridised.
Munidasa Cumaratunga
A friend of mine who?s involved with the Hela Havula made an interesting observation on Facebook recently. Apparently one Asiff Hussein, in his book Zeylanica: A Study of the Peoples and Languages of Sri Lanka, has contended rather arbitrarily that weeding away Sanskrit words completely from the ?maw basa? would do more harm than good for the latter, and that such a culture of weeding away those bywords was brought about and promoted by Munidasa Cumaratunga. Erroneous, since nowhere (based on what I have read, of Munidasa or by him) have I come across explicit polemics against resorting to Sanskrit at all. It seems that even academics, even the best read intellectuals, can?t move away from indulging in simplifications when assessing the cultural history of Sri Lanka. In fact I have a problem with anyone who categorises the likes of Cumaratunga, in such a way and I think it best to quote Malinda Seneviratne here: ?Reading ?Kumara Gee?, I cannot help, but conclude that Cumaratunga Munidasa, much as he loved the language of the Sinhalese, loved it less than he loved his nation and his people.? I think the main problem here is that we can?t, as a people or a community of critics, get ourselves beyond the dichotomised spheres we are made to gloss over. In the movies we are told to patronise the serious auteur, who wins award after award at film festivals the world over. In the realm of literature we are asked to go for established writers who win big at literary festivals organised by the State or by private bodies. Who has properly read Kathleen Jayawardena, for instance, without confusing his or her inability to get past her eloquent, but difficult prose for her lack of clarity, and who can watch Udayakantha Warnasuriya while seeing in him the great though flawed visual artist he is?? ?
Inability to understand?
I think that?s the mistake we are making here; confusing our inability to discern, to understand, to read, for our critical invincibility. It?s that kind of invincibility which made Malcolm Arnold claim that Charlotte Bronte?s Villette contained ?nothing but hunger, rebellion, and rage.? Such critical comments reek of complacency, chauvinism, defensiveness, which is what we ourselves have succumbed to. Sadly.??
This is why, before we go after foreign academics to distort our people and values, we need to fundamentally rethink our own attitudes regarding those values. What are values, in any case? A series of convenient fictions maintained to sustain uniformity over a collective? A series of myths and legends validated so as to empower a collective to assert its strength, numerical or otherwise, over other ethnic groups? Should such values, which are really more or less a mishmash of religious and secular if not quasi-secular conventions, necessarily define a particular culture, be it in the arts or in any other field? Is there a critical distance that must be maintained between art and culture? Can a separation thrive in the longer term, and if so, should it be maintained for long???
Becoming universal?
After the passing away of Amaradeva I observed, to my amusement, a barrage of hysterics issuing in gushes and torrents from commentators who on the one hand contended that the man, at the time of death, transcended his Sinhala-ness and Buddhist-ness and became universal, and who on the other hand responded that the cultural specifics of an artiste are too overwhelming, too powerful, for such an apotheosis to occur at all in the first place. Both were right and wrong, though I am inclined to lean on the argument of the latter (for personal reasons); right and wrong because cultural specifics exist, but not to the extent whereby they prevent the local artiste from being celebrated by those who don?t look for such specifics. The truly local artiste doesn?t hence remain local, but neither does he lose that welter of localness even after death. The same, incidentally, can be said of other cultural auteurs: Chitrasena, Sekera, Martin Wickramasinghe. After all, if cultural specifics were so holy as to erase the possibility of cultural fusion, we wouldn?t have been able to preserve the Sinhala language, in the form we resort to today, by importing (for the lack of a better term) Western linguistics.??
When it comes to cultural dynamics, consequently, I don?t think there?s such a thing as a sacred or holy cow. Nothing is sacrosanct, not even the truth, though I would prefer the truth to almost anything else when it comes to those cultural dynamics. Here both sides are in the wrong, again; the puritans because of their fervent, understandable, though considerably flawed act of rebellion against what they (erroneously, rarely correctly) see as an invasion of the local by the foreign; the hybridists because of their as fervent, as understandable, as flawed contention for a coming together of ?universal? forms (of art, science, knowledge, belief systems, etc) at the cost of local specifics. The former group artificially ?barricades? such cultures from modernity, while the latter seeks to open up those cultures, not to modernity, but to debasement and degradation undeserving of the modernist streak those who promote it market it as. On both counts, misconceived.??

There is never one art, never one cultural specific, but a multitude thereof. I believe that?s the main if not the only way to combat the purist and the uprooted. Both purists and uprooted cosmopolitans believe that cultural forms are or have been made to be singular and thus seek an artificial, unsustainable unity. It is this latter belief, or misconception, that compelled hysterics from those who reacted negatively towards Kishani Jayasinghe?s operatic rendition of ?Danno Budunge?, thinking that ?Danno Budunge? was a Buddhist song (imagine that!), a rather anti-historical claim that compelled a Facebook response from the great-grandson of the composer of that song (John de Silva), Harsha Makalande. Here too, you see the same conflation; of critical puritanism with critical invincibility.?
?
I think it?s time we realised that it?s because we make such conflations, unconsciously or otherwise, that outside academics make arbitrary judgments on our own cultural histories. Yes, tragedy at one level, but an inevitability at another. Makes me?smile. Again.??

Priority bus lane from Borella to Maradana from tomorrow
	
The priority bus lane will be in force from Borella to Maradana from tomorrow, the Megapolis and Western Development Ministry said today.
It will apply to the P. De S Kularatne (Maradana Road) from 6 am to 9 am for buses on route numbers 176 and 103.
Meanwhile, officials said the priority bus lane at Battaramulla was put on hold for two weeks until the construction of the Rajagiriya Flyover was completed.
They said the priority lanes along the Galle Road towards Colombo adopted last year has contributed to a significant reduction in traffic within Colombo City limits.
The project was introduced to the country last March as a pilot project carried out by the Ministry in collaboration with the Moratuwa University.
Subject Minister Champika Ranawaka said Deputy Speaker Thilanga Sumathipala will attend the launching of the project tomorrow. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

Rajagiriya flyover, Moragahakanda planned by my Govt: MR
	
In a statement on the third anniversary of the yahapalana government, former president Mahinda Rajapaksa said the Moragahakanda project was planned, funds allocated and construction work launched under his government in 2007 under the 2005 Mahinda Chintana programme.
He said even the Rajagiriya flyover was planned and money allocated for its construction by his government and pointed out that Cabinet approval was granted to select contractors for the construction of the flyovers in Rajagiriya, Polgahawela and Ganemulla at the cabinet meeting held on December 4, 2014.
Mr. Rajapaksa also held the yahapalana government responsible for the current debt crisis.
In his statement he said, "During the short period of 36 months that this government has been in power, they have borrowed over USD14.6 billion in foreign currency loans alone, the breakdown of which would be as follows - USD7.2 billion through the issue of Sri Lanka Development Bonds from January 2015 onward, USD3.6 billion from sovereign bonds issued in 2015 and 2017, USD2.2 billion through currency swap arrangements with India in 2015 and 2016, USD 1.7 billion through syndicated loans arranged through several international banks in 2016 and 2017 and USD1.5 billion from the IMF Extended Fund Facility in 2016. No previous government has borrowed so much money by way of foreign currency loans in such a short time.

Ravi denies Mano Ganesan's claims
	
UNP MP Ravi Karunanayake yesterday denied the claims made by Tamil Progressive Alliance (TPA) leader Minister Mano Ganesan that underworld figures had been nominated for the upcoming local government (LG) elections to represent the Colombo North.
Responding to a question raised by a journalist when MP Karunanayake visiting the grave site of slain newspaper editor Lasantha Wickrematunge, on his 9th death anniversary at the Borella Cemetery in Colombo, said, if 'members of underworld' can stay in the government what would be the problem.
?I cordially invite all media personnel to visit Colombo North and to investigate over the claims made by Minister Mano Ganesan. We are walking freely but that minister is walking with special security,? he said.
Earlier Minister Mano Ganesan requested President Maithripala Sirisena to provide him with Special Task Force (STF) security with a backup vehicle with five STF personnel to protect him from underworld threats.
Mano Ganesan earlier said in a statement that he faced with serious security threats and sought the intervention of President, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and had also written to the IGP in September last year.
?MP Karunanayaka said people cannot do politics like ?Re Daniel Dawal Migel? or by engaging in religious extremism or highlighting racial issues".
?UNP is the only political party which promotes the religious diversity in the country without any discrimination. We always maintain a common policy whether we were in government or in an election period,? he said.
?We urge Minister Mano Ganesan to name the underworld figures if we have nominated such people for the LG election.We do politics in clean manner. The people who cannot obtain votes during the election making such claims and it was a habit to make such claims during the election period against UNP,? he added.
?We can easily figure out the person who tried to protect the underworld figures even after we named them earlier. The politicians who behave like underworld figures talks more about underworld. Colombo North is free zone for any one and the previous underworld figures were removed by me,? MP Karunanayaka said. (Chaturanga Pradeep Samarawickrama and Indika Sri Aravinda)

Rejection of  nomination lists  ?A pre-scrutinizing system  would avoid such rejections?  - Canishka
	
?
A case-by-case study is to be conducted to conclude whether? mismanagement caused these mistakes which led to the rejections
	Returning officers and other officers should exercise statutory powers not to curtail the democratic rights to vote or? contest elections
	Leaders of Independent groups and Party secretaries should have their own teams and systems to attend to this responsible job?
	Nomination papers could be rejected only if they fail to contain the requirements of the law
?
Constitutional Lawyer Canishka G Witharana, in an interview with the , spoke about nomination lists of some political parties being rejected and the legality involved. The interview done with Witharana follows:? ?
Q? You filed two court cases regarding the rejection of the SLPP nomination list for Maharagama. What is your opinion about rejection???
?A particular rejection referred to in your question is bad in law and against the very purpose and objectives of the Local Authority?s Elections Ordinance. There are two cases, one filed in the Court of Appeal against the Returning officer of the Maharagama Urban Council. The other is in the Supreme Court where the members of the Election Commission are also made Respondents in addition to the Returning officer. Both are writ applications seeking to quash the decision of the returning officer to reject the nomination paper.? ?
?
If the returning officer ?examined? the nomination paper carefully such additional information was there for the returning officer to decide that such a candidate was female
Q Being a lawyer tell us how the political parties and independent groups can avoid the rejection of nomination papers???
?Leaders of Independent groups and Party secretaries should have their own teams and systems to attend to the responsible job of completing nomination papers. Ultimately it?s the responsibility of the Party secretaries and leaders of independent groups to submit legally valid nomination papers. They should sign each nomination paper certifying the accuracy of the information contained. The adoption of a pre-scrutinizing system before submitting nomination papers for the signature of party secretaries and leaders would avoid such rejections.? ?
Q?Some lists have been rejected on the basis such as the inadvertent reference to a male as a female, the non-mention of dates etc. What do you think of the political parties making such trivial mistakes???
?The rejection of nomination papers shouldn?t be used as a tool of consideration to pass judgments on political parties or independent groups. Humans aren?t perfect and tend to make mistakes. The law excuses these mistakes. Inadvertent mistakes (themselves) don?t authorize returning officers to reject nomination papers.
Nomination papers could be rejected only if they fail to contain the requirements of the law. On the other hand returning officers are also vested with the legal duty and power to ?examine? nomination papers before rejecting them. Returning officers and other officers acting under the authority of the Elections Commission should exercise statutory powers to achieve and uphold democracy; but not to curtail the democratic rights to vote or contest elections.? ?
Q? The Elections Commission states that the political parties rush through when compiling nomination lists, eventually resulting in mistakes. Do you agree with this viewpoint???
?An election is a legal process. A nomination paper is the method or instrument by which the candidate enters this process. When elections are declared, political parties and independent groups would have to deal with a sudden flux of prospective candidates competing with each other to secure an opportunity in the nomination paper. It?s a time when the decision making ability and management skills of party secretaries, leaders etc., are being tested. As said earlier parties and groups should have proper management systems to face this situation. However a case-by-case study is to be conducted to conclude whether mismanagement caused these mistakes which led to the rejections.? ?
?
There are two instances in section 31(3) applicable to individual disqualifications, where without rejecting the entire nomination paper
Q? Do you believe you have a strong case in Maharagama???
?In my opinion, Yes. However, it?s ultimately in the hands of Their Lordships to decide. The crux of the argument raised in the petitions presented to Courts is as follows. Under section 31 of the Local Government Elections Ordinance, the returning officer is authorised to reject a nomination paper if it ?does not contain the total number of women candidates as required to be nominated under subsection (2A) of section 28 of this Ordinance.? The SLPP nomination paper handed over for the Maharagama Urban Council did contain the required number of women candidates (4 candidates). However with regard to one of them, the gender was (inadvertently) mentioned as ?male? instead of ?female?. The Authorised agent of the party (SLPP) informed the returning officer in writing that it was a mistake and that the candidate was in fact a ?female?. Her national identity card number was also available, hence any Government officer should have the basic information to identify the gender of a candidate in relation to meeting the required number. Further her name was stated in a separate ?list of women candidates? submitted with the nomination paper. If the returning officer ?examined? the nomination paper carefully (as required by law) such additional information was there for the returning officer to decide that such a candidate was female. However, the returning officer, without examining whether the nomination paper contained the required number of women candidates, only considered whether the same had been stated specifically (the manner in which it was stated). That officer knew it was a mistake by that time. So the Returning Officer ignored the correct information with regard to the gender and mechanically acted on an admittedly mistaken statement and rejected the nomination paper (purely on a curable clerical mistake). The Petitioners state that the conduct of the returning officer was arbitrary and malicious. There are other grounds where a challenge can be made in those cases as well.??
Q? Mostly the nomination papers of SLPP have been rejected this time. Why is this???
?I don?t wish to present political theories and explanations. I can only state legal and practical reasons of the rejections. They aren?t party specific. I have already stated them earlier.??
?
That officer knew it was a mistake by that time. So the Returning Officer ignored the correct information with regard to the gender and mechanically acted on an admittedly mistaken statement and rejected the nomination paper (purely on a curable clerical mistake)
Q? What is your view on the conditions stipulated in the law to be fulfilled in the submission of nomination lists???
As far as the Local Government Elections are concerned, the requirements to be fulfilled are stated in sections 28, 29 and 30 of the Local Government Elections Ordinance. A Nomination paper should contain the information as stipulated in section 28 and in accordance with the format in first Schedule to the Ordinance. Sections 29 and 30 deal with making of deposits and their disposal. The law provides good guidance. Additionally the Elections Commission also issued several documents containing instructions and guidelines to follow.? ?
However grounds of rejection are stated in Section 31. First there is a duty on the part of the returning officer to ?examine? whether these grounds do exist. Such rejection could only be done when nomination papers are (i) not delivered in accordance with the provisions of subsection (5) of section 28, (ii) do not contain the total number of candidates required to be nominated under subsection (2) of section 28, (iii) respect of which the deposit required under section 29 has not been made; (iv) where the signature of the secretary in the case of a recognized political party or of the group leader in the case of an independent group does not appear on the nomination paper or where such signature hasn?t been attested as required by subsection (5) of section 28; (v) that doesn?t contain the total number of women candidates as required to be nominated under subsection (2A) of section 28 of this Ordinance.??
There are two instances in section 31(3) applicable to individual disqualifications, where without rejecting the entire nomination paper, the name of the candidate or the person concerned who is found to be disqualified due to any of the reasons specified in that subsection shall be removed from the nomination paper.??
Q?How complicated are they???
They aren?t so complicated. You don?t need a lawyer to complete nomination papers. Any reasonable person working with due diligence and care could complete them. I feel that we needn?t change the law. Instead the standards and of both the candidates (including party secretaries and leaders) and election officers implementing the law should be elevated to meet the standards of the law. Such changes are essential to strengthen the democratic process of elections and pave the way to achieve its sacred objectives.???

Remove PM for a fair bond trial: JO
	
The joint opposition (JO) today requested President Maithripala Sirisena to remove Prime Minister Ranil Wikcremesinghe so as to ensure a free and fair trial on the Central Bank bond scam.
Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) Chairman G.L. Peiris told a media conference that the President was unable to take any practical measures as long as Mr. Wickremesinghe continued to function as Premier.
?The Prime Minister's name was also mentioned in the bond report. He said he will take the responsibility for appointing Arjuna Mahendran as the Central Bank Governor. It is the Premier who is behind this. President Sirisena says he will use the ?sword? irrespective of the status of the wrongdoers. He should first use it against the Prime Minister,? Prof. Peiris said.
He said the ?sword? should be next used on the COPE members who are alleged to have had links with PTL owner Arjun Aloysius.
Meanwhile, he said the convening of Parliament without publishing the Bond report was a useless exercise.
?If it is published at the last minute, there will be no time for anyone to study the report. There is no point in talking about something unknown,? he said.? (Lahiru Pothmulla)

This female is in the running for a seat in a local body in the Wayamba province and she has made it a point to attend every funeral in the area and weep for a long spell as if she has lost someone whom she had loved most in her life.?

The weeping one, who was living with her husband and children in a Colombo suburb, has returned to her native village since receiving nomination from a main political party has now begun carrying out her propaganda activity from her parental home. Taking extra care not to violate the laws relating to electioneering now being strictly enforced, the fair one is ever on the lookout for innocuous ways and means of winning the hearts and minds of her constituents, they say.
She attends whatever social function taking place in the area and would not fail to say ?hello!? to everyone she meets.
