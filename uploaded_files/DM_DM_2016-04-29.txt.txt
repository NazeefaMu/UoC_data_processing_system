Bopage looking into words with AG, IGP
	
Parliamentary Reforms and Mass Media Ministry secretary Nimal Bopage, who is in the centre of controversy over his statement to the media, said today he, in consultation with the Attorney General and the Inspector General of Police (IGP), would discuss the possibility of introducing some mechanism to deal with the use of words with no legal validity in the media.
He said it was his initiative to issue a statement to the media asking them to exercise caution, when using the term the Joint Opposition, and that there was no involvement of any political authority in it.
In a hurriedly summoned press conference, he said he did it with good intentions to have a close rapport with media personnel, but it had been given a wrong interpretation by some media organisations.
Mr. Bopage said the term Joint Opposition had no legal validity.
We have the Government and the Opposition. But, people get confused with what the Joint Opposition is. As a result, it will give a bad precedent to use that term. However, if the media can convince the general public with facts, they can use it, he said.
He also asked the media to question the use of the words Good Governance Government or Yahapalana Government. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

SL secures $1.5 billion IMF loan to help bolster finances
	
Sri Lanka reached an agreement with the International Monetary Fund for $1.5 billion in loans to help lower its borrowing costs and bolster finances.
The South Asian nation has pledged to narrow its fiscal deficit to 3.5 percent of gross domestic product by 2020 through a comprehensive set of reforms to Sri Lankas tax system, the Washington-based lender said in a statement. The loan program will need approval by the IMFs executive board, which is due to consider it in early June.
Once approved, its expected to catalyze an additional $650 million in other multilateral and bilateral loans, bringing total support to about $2.2 billion, over and above existing financing arrangements, the IMF said.
Sri Lanka was looking for a loan of as much as $1.5 billion from the IMF as a seal of approval for the governments policies in order to help draw further foreign inflows, central bank Governor Arjuna Mahendran said in an interview last month.
The government is seeking to sell as much as $3 billion of bonds in international markets this year after refinancing concerns prompted Fitch Ratings to downgrade the nation and Standard & Poors to cut its rating outlook to negative.
The rupee is trading near a record low after worsening foreign-exchange reserves and balance of payments forced the central bank to stop propping up the currency. 

The government is committed to dealing quickly with the legacy of Sri Lankan Airlines, which continues to represent a drain on public finances after years of mismanagement, the IMF said. Going forward, key state firms will be governed transparently by annually published statements of corporate plans, it said.
Sri Lanka has pledged to ensure that the pricing of electricity and fuels is guided by the market, with subsidies needed to protect the poor being better targeted and clearly reflected on the governments budget, according to the IMF.
The central bank will shift toward a flexible inflation targeting regime while also undertaking measures to help deepen foreign exchange markets and support a durable transition to a flexible exchange rate regime, according to the statement.
Sri Lanka last sought an IMF loan in 2009 following the end of a three-decade old civil war and under the leadership of Mahinda Rajapaksa, to bolster its international reserves. It received the final tranche of the $2.6 billion IMF loan in 2012. (bloomberg)

Vehicle prices go up with VAT: Importers
	
The prices of imported vehicle would be increased due to the major foreign currency fluctuation with no change in the present situation in tax regime, Chairman of Lanka Vehicle Importers' Association Mahinda Sarathchandra said.
He said that three vehicle associations including Brand-new Vehicle Importers Association and two other Used Vehicle Importers Associations yesterday met with the Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake at the Finance Ministry regarding the increase in the VAT.
During the discussion the Finance Minister stated that no changes could be made to the tax.
He said if there was no change to the VAT before May 2 vehicle prices would be increased by Rs. 300,000 and Rs.400,000.
The vehicle importation industry has faced a huge downfall due to this prevailing economic pattern.
He said that an importer who imported 100 vehicle would now could import on 30 because of the VAT hike.
Yesterday the Prime Minister appointed a committee to solve the legal issues regarding vehicle importation.
We have requested the Finance Minister to provide a considerable relief on tax concessions imposed on vehicle imports and the Minister said that is under consideration, Mr. Sarathchandra said.
The Finance Minister said the earlier tax concessions made more people to buy vehicles and because of that, the number of vehicles on the road had increased causing huge road traffic congestion, he said.
The main idea of imposing more tax on vehicle import was to limit vehicles put on to the road, he said.
When contacted the Brand New Motor Vehicle Importers Association President Gihan Pilapitiya said there would be no duty changes but valuation of brand new vehicles and the Customs Duty should be reviewed.
The prices of brand new vehicles are decided by relevant vehicle manufacturing companies. Without considering the manufactures price, it is not reasonable to increase the Customs Tax according to Government decisions, he said.
But according to our knowledge the Value Added Tax (VAT) is not relevant to decide the vehicle price but all the taxes, which had to be imposed, have already being imposed, he said. (Chaturanga Pradeep)

Will have Sri Lankas back, assures US
	
Sri Lanka has taken swift strides in the aftermath of the conflict and the US would be there with Sri Lanka and have its back when taking such steps since it is not an easy task, US Permanent Representative to the UN Samantha Power assured on Thursday.
Addressing a US-Sri Lanka Trade and Investment Framework Agreement Council Meeting in Washington, US she said that she had traveled to many places going through transition and change, many of which have gone through conflict.
Each conflict is different from the other. Conflicts also have left deep scars in nations, as it has in Sri Lanka. I can say I have never seen a country take such swift strides in so little time. I think its extremely important that when a country takes such steps that the United States be there with you and have your back because its certainly not easy, she said.
She said that US President Barrack Obama, himself, places importance on relationship with Sri Lanka and that his commitment continues to support President Maithripala Sirisena in his efforts to ensure that Sri Lanka delivers socio-economic benefits for the people of the country.
The wounds from the war run deep in peoples hearts and souls, the political headwinds that one faces, particularly when one is trying to execute as ambitious an agenda as President Sirisena and his government are doing  those headwinds can be very intense  and theres a ton of work left to be done, including on such goals as transitional justice, promoting lasting reconciliation, improving the quality of governance, clearing out the red tape, all of the issues that you all are trying to work through, she said.
Meanwhile, Power said Sri Lanka has emerged as a global champion of human rights and democratic accountability since January 2015, after becoming a sad example of creeping authoritarianism very recently.
In an era where you see yet another world leader trying to change their constitution, expand the powers of whatever office they hold, here you have a situation where President Sirisenas government has passed an amendment to Sri Lankas constitution that reintroduced a two-term limit and reduced the power of his own office, she said.
Achieving the socio-economic growth that people want right now is probably going to take a little more time given the legacy of war, the corruption, and the economic mismanagement of recent years, and some of the global economic dynamics, Power said.
The Joint Action Plan being adopted will help make this happen. It will expand trade, encourage foreign investment, and spur growth  and in so doing, it will help boost employment, income, and living standards, she said.
