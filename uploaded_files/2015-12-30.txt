Action against Hirunika if guilty: Minister
	
Disciplinary action will be taken against UNP parliamentarian Hirunika Premachandra if she is found guilty of being involved in the recent abduction drama, a senior minister said today.
Minister Kabir Hashim told a media briefing that the police have been given a free hand to investigate the matter.
?None of the government ministers had influenced nor will influence the police to stop any investigation in to the matter," he said.
When asked whether the UNP had the right to take disciplinary action, the minister said the party has that right because she contested as a member of the UNF.
?Let the police do their job first and then we will act if necessary," he said. ?We did not send Ms. Premachandra to Singapore in a helicopter as the previous government sent a certain person abroad just after her father was killed," the minister added.
Meanwhile Minister Duminda Dissanayake said it was essential to determine whether the abduction was carried out by the MP's supporters without her knowledge. He said that wrong doings by supporters of a politician was often blamed on the politician.
He said it was Ms. Premachandra who had handed over her supporters to the police. (Yohan Perera and Chaturanga Pradeep)

CMC blacklists Enrique?s concert organisers
	
	The Colombo Municipality today blacklisted the Company, Live Events which organised the Enrique Iglesias concert at the CR&FC Grounds. The main stakeholders of the company are former cricketing stars Kumar Sangakkara and Mahela Jayawardane.
	The Municipality said it would not allow the company to organise any other events in Colombo in the future.
	Colombo Mayor A.J.M. Muzammil told a media briefing that they would also take legal action against the organizers if they failed to pay Rs.29 million in taxes owed to the municipality.
	?We will not allow the company to hold any other event within the Colombo Municipal limits even if it settles the payment owed to the CMC,? he said.
	Mr. Muzammil said the organizers did not inform the CMC prior to organizing the event and said the CMC asked them to brief it about the show.
	?The CMC could have banned the live concert by Latin America music idol Enrique Iglesias held at the CR & FC Grounds, but we didn?t do so. The ticket holders could have burnt the CR & FC if we did so and would have tarnished the image of the country,? he said
	Mr. Muzzammil said all the tickets had to be approved and sealed by the CMC but only a few tickets had been given to the CMC for the approval and sealing.
	?The organizers had informed us that they will only issue 7,130 tickets, but we have evidence and information to prove that they had issued more than 10,000 tickets. Therefore they had committed a financial fraud. We will give them a week to settle the balance tax amount,? he said.
	Mr. Muzzammil said the organisers of the company should focus on settling the amount owed to the Municipality instead of compensating fans who attended the event. (Darshana Sanjeewa)

Disgruntled Enrique concert goer sends Rs.22m letter of demand to Live Events
	
A lawyer and his wife have sent a letter of demand to Live Events demanding Rs.22 million for ?loss, damage and mental stress? experienced during the Enrique Iglesias concert held recently.
The Letter of Demand, which was released to the public, details harassment and mistreatment endured by the couple when they bought two Rs.35,000 tickets and had to stand outside for over two hours before being admitted to the ground. They complained the event was badly organised, sound quality terrible, and no explanation was given for the delay.
The strongest censure is reserved for the lapse of security that enabled people with cheaper tickets to storm into the VIP area and the similar disregard for exclusivity during the after party.
?My client had purchased VIP tickets with the reasonable expectation to be in the company of an exclusive limited crowd who would have purchased tickets paying the same sum of money.
However as conceded by you there had been a breach of security resulting in persons who had purchased tickets at lower values and even persons that had not purchased tickets having entered the VIP areas,? noted the Letter of Demand.
Legal action will be brought against the company if a response is not received within two weeks, the document went onto say. (Daily FT)

## Title: End of the road for high speed internet in SL?

End of the road for high speed internet in SL?
	
	In a bizarre turn of events, the newly appointed Director General of the Telecommunications Regulatory Commission (TRC), Sunil S. Sirisena has decided to discontinue the National Broadband Initiative (NBI), which ensured high speed broadband internet access to citizens at affordable prices, Mirror Business learns.
	It is also learnt that the man who spearheaded the NBI for three years, Sanath Siriwardena, has been shown the door from the TRC, effective from December 31, 2015, for reasons best known to the new Director General.
	However when inquired, Sirisena denied such moves to shut down the NBI but said he had taken a decision to discontinue the contracts of all consultants at the TRC, including that of Siriwardena?s.
	Despite his claims to run the unit with the leadership of another senior official at the TRC, it is uncertain as to how to continue the NBI without the required expertise at the TRC for broadband technology.
	Mirror Business later discovered that the contracts of three other consultants at the TRC have not been terminated as claimed by Sirisena but only of Siriwardena?s.
	The termination of Siriwardena?s services is suspected of the culmination of a personal grudge wielded by a section of the top brass at the TRC against Siriwardena for some time.
	It is also speculated that the possible shutting down of NBI is also part of a scheme by a certain operator as Siriwardena saved billion of tax payers? money being siphoned off to such an operator under the guise of providing internet to schools.
	Either way, the biggest losers will be the country?s citizenry who had hitherto enjoyed one of the world?s fastest internet services at an extremely affordable price.
	The NBI was established under the guidance of the then Secretary to the President and the Chairman of TRC, Lalith Weeratunge as an extension to the National Broadband Consultative Committee which was established in 2010 to spearhead broadband Internet development in Sri Lanka.
	Since the formation of the initiative, Sri Lanka has made significant strides in the development of its broadband platform.
	In 2014, Sri Lanka was ranked among top 50 countries with access to high speed broadband (speed above 4 Mbps), outperforming countries like Australia, Malaysia, China and India.
	This was possible in a very short span of time by continuously making broadband affordable while increasing the quality of services; the two goals simultaneously pursued by the NBI.
	In 2012, Sri Lanka was ranked world?s number one for the lowest entry level fixed broadband charges by the International Telecommunication Union.
	Senior retired public servant, Sirisena, who served 36 years as a member of the Sri Lanka Administrative Service was appointed as the TRC Director General on October 15, 2015 subsequent to the President?s Counsel M.M. Zuhair?s tenor as the Director General came to an abrupt ending after a few months in office under the good governance regime.
	Sirisena had previously served as the Secretary to the Ministries of Education, Co-operatives and Internal Trade and Foreign Employment Promotion and Welfare. Siriwardena is a highly regarded expert in the mobile broadband technology who has been working as a consultant to the TRC since 2010 before taking the reins as the head of the NBI in 2013.
	He was instrumental in setting the standards for broadband in Sri Lanka and they are now being benchmarked by several other countries in the region to uplift their broadband service quality. During his 5-year tenor at the TRC, the broadband subscriber base increased from 500, 000 to 2.6 million as of today. He introduced many industry firsts; one of which was the speed testing facility which enabled subscribers to measure the broadband internet speed enjoyed by them, compelling the service provider to keep to the advertised speeds. After seeing the system, Maldives had asked TRC to implement the same in their country.
	Absence of the NBI will leave the subscribers at the mercy of the operators as there will be no state body to lodge complaints against unscrupulous service providers.

Entire House to be a Select Committee
	
	Parliament will be converted to a Select Committee which will be responsible for drafting the new constitution, Constitutional Committee Adviser and MP Jayampathy Wickramaratne said today.
	He told a news conference that this committee would not be similar to an ordinary select committee made up of a certain number of MPs conducting closed door sessions but it would be one in which all MPs will be included.
	?All MPs will be included in this select committee while all details of the sessions will go into the hanzard,? Mr. Jayampathy said adding that the sessions would be telecast live and open to the media.
	Outlining the process which the government intends to adopt in enacting a new constitution, Mr. Wickramaratne said the draft prepared by the select committee would be submitted to the Cabinet for approval and when approved would have to be passed with a two-thirds majority in Parliament. He said the draft constitution would then be put to a referendum to obtain the consent of the people.
	?We will follow the procedure outlined by the present constitution,? he said.
	Dr. Wickramatane dismissed the argument put forward by former MP G. L. Peiris that there were some sections of the present constitution had to be passed by separate referendums.
	He said it would be possible to approve a new constitution under Article 75 of the present constitution. He recalled that Mr. Peris himself sought approval for the draft constitution in 2000 with a single referendum. (Yohan Perera and Chaturanga Pradeep)Pix by Pradeep Pathirana

Joint opp. warns of Constitutional coup
	
The Joint Opposition today charged that there was a ?Constitutional Coup? backed by the western countries and that?s what had made the government to introduce a new Constitution.
Pivithuru Hela Urumaya (PHU) General Secretary and MP Udaya Gammanpila said this ?Constitutional Coup? would weaken the power of the Central Government by devolving power to local councils on the periphery.
?By decentralizing power, countries eyeing Sri Lanka for their political agendas could get hold of the country by influencing through peripheral and independent institutions. When the commissions are more independent, they will most likely be controlled by NGOs and so called civil organizations. This is a golden opportunity for certain countries to initiate their plans on Sri Lanka,? he said.
Commenting on a book titled ?Monsoon? authored by Robert D. Kaplan of the US, Mr. Gammanpila said the book had also emphasized the strategically significant location of Sri Lanka and how the global power struggle would evolve in the Indian Ocean region in the coming years.
He said they would seek legal action against a Constitution which would put the country in danger by weakening the power of the State.
?We can?t rely on parliament to make amendments to a Constitution because of the government's two-thirds majority. The government retains such majority through incentives. Therefore, we will seek the help of the judiciary when needed and request the people to reject a Constitution detrimental to the country at the referendum,? he said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

## Title: Kolonnawa UC Chairman remanded over assault charges

Kolonnawa UC Chairman remanded over assault charges
	
Colombo Additional Magistrate Augusta Atapattu today criticised the Wellampitiya Police and remanded the Kolonnawa UC Chairman till January 4 on charges of assaulting the participants of a peaceful picket against the garbage dumping in Kolonnawa by the Colombo Municipality.
Counsel Gunaratna Wanninayake appearing with a team of lawyers for the aggrieved party said the residents had protested over the dumping of garbage brought from the Colombo Municipal limits.
He said the Wellampitiya Police had wilfully failed to provide protection to the protesters.
The counsel said after the police withdrew from the scene, the Kolonnawa Urban Council Chairman Ravindra Udaya Shantha had come there in a blue vehicle with about 15 to 20 thugs and assaulted the protesters.
He said six people including Attorney-at-law Nuwan Bopage were injured and warded in hospital.
The counsel said the Chairman was furious over the protest because the chairman is paid Rs. 4,000 by the Colombo Municipality for every truck load of garbage dumped there.
Counsel Gunaratne said there are four cases pending in the Magistrate Courts against the chairman on charges of assaulting and kidnapping people. The counsel requested the Magistrate to remand the suspect based on his previous record.
The counsel said the Wellampitiya OIC had asked the suspect to come to court without informing the aggrieved party about it.
He said the police was biased because of the political influence of the UC Chairman.
The Wellampitiya Police OIC told the Magistrate that another court had issued a restraining order on the protesters preventing them from obstructing the lorries that bring garbage to the dump. He said the protesters had carried out the picket with adhering to that order.
Counsel Anton Senanayake appearing for the chairman said on December 27 the chairman while on his way to Kolonnawa from Nuwara Eliya had received a phone call about the protest and had gone to the scene to see what was happening and pointed out that the allegations were made against the chairman because of political differences.
The Magistrate observed that every citizen had the right to engage in peaceful protests and nobody could assault them. The Magistrate blamed the police for their arbitrary action. (T. Farook Thajudeen)

Lankan envoy clears up ?misunderstandings?
	
	In a statement to clear any misunderstanding that the Sri Lankan mission in the Kingdom was not involved in seeking clemency for the Sri Lankan maid, who was recently spared from being sentenced to death for adultery, Azmi Thassim, Sri Lankan Ambassador to the Kingdom, said that the Lankan embassy in Riyadh played a major role in the appeal.
	?I?m very sorry if someone is not appreciating the Sri Lankan mission in Riyadh and the Sri Lankan government due to the tremendous support and efforts they put to seek clemency for the victim of the adultery case,? he said.
	Thassim slammed the negativity and racist comments on social media platforms, describing them as ?malicious.? He said that it is important that situations as such need to be handled in a responsible manner. ?I praise the media who played a very responsible role in this instance and the majority who supported this and safeguarded the identity and dignity of the victims.?
	Saudi authorities reduced the 45-year-old Sri Lankan maid's death sentence to a three-year jail term after an appeal, Colombo's foreign ministry confirmed.
	The ambassador expressed his respect, gratitude and appreciation to the embassy officials in Riyadh who undertook the case with responsibility and assisted from the time they heard about the case till the death penalty was lifted.
	He added that all the procedures were completed by the embassy officials, despite it being tough and costly, before he arrived in Riyadh as ambassador.
	?I also thank the Sri Lankan government for having done a great job in providing assistance and guidance to the embassy whenever they needed it, especially to retain lawyers.?
	Thassim lauded the Saudi judiciary and authorities for their considerate judgment given to the Sri Lankan maid. ?We are very happy that the judges received the case well and unanimously decided to do away with the stoning to death,? he said. ?There were several hearings held before the first judgment was given rather than simply implementing a verdict. The case was re-opened after several observations of the appeal and the victims were given an opportunity to explain and express themselves ? to which they confessed to being under severe pressure at the time.?
	Explaining the measures taken by the Sri Lankan mission in the Kingdom to avoid such errors in the future, Thassim requested the community and all the media who are focusing on this particular incident and the judgment, to take heed. ?We must always take precautions and not wait till something major happens and start blaming and pointing fingers. Instead, we must educate the people as much as possible about the laws of a country.?
	He pointed out that it is the responsibility of a government and the civil society to educate people about the seriousness of not knowing the rules and regulations and walking into an unknown territory.(Arab News)

No troubled water over bridge
	
	The plan to construct a bridge connecting Sri Lanka and India will suffer the same fate as the Sethu Samurdram project due to environmental issues, a minister said yesterday.
	Highways and Higher Education Minister Lakshman Kiriella said the proposed bridge would never materialise as it would adversely affect the marine environment.
	The minister made this comment with regard to a recent allegation by the joint opposition that the Sri Lankan government had given the go-ahead for the project.
	He said the government had no interest in such a bridge as there was no need for it. ?A bridge between Sri Lanka and India is not needed at all,? he said; adding that Sri Lanka should rather concentrate on constructing roads within the country. ?Preparation of the ground for the Colombo -- Kandy Highway has already begun and construction work is due begin early next year. Work on the Northern Highway will begin before the end of 2016,? he said.
	In response to a journalist who asked him what the government would do if the India insisted on constructing the highway, he said the Indian government had not insisted so far and was not likely to in the future because of environmental concerns.
	He asked why the opposition believed the Indian minister?s version though Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe had stated in Parliament that there was no move to build such a bridge. Indian media had earlier quoted Indian Transport Minister Nitin Gadikari as saying his country was planning to construct an Indo -- Lanka bridge at a cost of US$ 5 billion. (Yohan Perera)

I was removed for voicing against corruption: Nishantha
	
JHU Spokesman and former Western Province Health Minister Nishantha Sri Warnasinghe said today he was removed from his ministerial portfolios in an act of political revenge because he had lodged complaints with the Bribery Commission and other law enforcements agencies against corrupt politicians in the previous government.
He told a media conference that according to the Constitution, a provincial minister could not be removed on the basis of a financial statement being defeated.
?I was not officially informed of the move to take over my ministerial portfolios and came to know about it through media that my ministerial portfolios were taken over by Chief Minister Isura Devapriya. If I was to be removed he should have informed me in advance. This is an act of political revenge,? he said.
Mr. Warnasinghe said since he worked hard in lodging complaints with the Bribery Commission and other law enforcements agencies against offences committed by several politicians, who represented previous government, he had to become a victim in their well planned act revenge.
Meanwhile, he said he would never stop his political journey over some people?s cheap and futile attempts to discourage him. He added that he would serve as a provincial councilor within the council and give his best towards the betterment of the people.
Mr. Warnasinghe who served as a provincial minister for three months said he never considered his ministerial portfolio as an adornment and was not disappointed over the loss because he knew how he stood against the injustice by other councilors.
During the media briefing he said the Governor had called for a special vote on the expenditure head of the Health Ministry tomorrow. (Piyumi Fonseka)
