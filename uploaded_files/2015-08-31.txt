Saudi fire: Embassy checking on casualties
	
Officials of the Sri Lankan Embassy in Saudi have been directed to check whether any Sri Lankan employees had been affected by the fire which engulfed the Aramco Oil Company?s residential complex, Foreign Employment Bureau (FEB) said.
The fire is reported to have killed at least eleven people and injured 206.
FEB Deputy General Manager Mangala Randeniya told Daily Mirror the officials are facing difficulties in getting there because the fire had led to the closure of several roads leading to the residential complex.
He said the Embassy had no information yet whether any Sri Lankan?s might have died or been injured in the fire.
However, Mr. Randeniya said they had not ruled out the possibility of any Sri Lankans being caught up in the fire because they are known to visit the complex often.
Meanwhile, Saudi Civil Defence authorities, in a message posted on Twitter, said the casualties were from "various nationalities" but gave no details.
According to reports, the Aramco Oil Company employs more than 61,000 workers from 77 countries. (Piyumi Fonseka)

PCoI summons ex-ITN chief
	
The Presidential Commission of Inquiry (PCoI) will today interrogate former ITN chairman Anura Siriwardena over a loss of Rs.115 million incurred by the state-owned television station for broadcasting ex-president Mahinda Rajapaksa's advertisements, which were not paid for.
PCoI Secretary Lacille De Silva said the probe into the losses incurred by the TV channel had revealed that whilst the ITN was running ads for Mr. Rajapaksa without payment, the rates for commercials had been double quoted for his chief opponent Maithripala Sirisena.
The ITN had recently reimbursed a sum of Rs.89.9 million paid by President Maithripala Sirisena for his presidential campaign commercials, as the channel had failed to broadcast those for reasons best known to them.
Mr. De Silva said state sector institutes should give an equal opportunity and provide a level playing field for both government and opposition politicians in an election.
Former ITN Chairman Anura Siriwardena who was summoned to be questioned on this matter last morning at the PCoI office but it has been put off for today
The PCoI commenced investigations following a complaint received regarding a massive loss incurred to the ITN due to the non-payment of funds by the former President. (Kurulu Koojana Kariyakarawan)

Pivithuru Hela Urumaya (PHU) General Secretary Udaya Gammanpila said today several constituent parties of the United Peoples Freedom Alliance (UPFA) would contest the local government election under a new political alliance.
?Discussions are underway to form new alliance but we have to figure out a name, a symbol and other modalities. We will finalize these matters soon,? he said.
Mr. Gammanpila said they believed that the UPFA?s defeat at the general election was because of the action taken by President Maithripala Sirisena in his capacity as UPFA Chairman.
He said against this background, most of the constituent parties of UPFA were not too keen to contest under UPFA as long as President Sirisena remains its Chairman.
Meanwhile, UPFA allies such as the Democratic Left Front led by Vasudeva Nanayakkara and the National Freedom Front led by Wimal Weerawansa had also expressed sentiments supportive of forming such an alliance. (Lahiru Pothmulla)
