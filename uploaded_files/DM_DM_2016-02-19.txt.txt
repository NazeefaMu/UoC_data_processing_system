Joint opposition condemns PM's views on media
	
The joint opposition today criticized the statement made by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe concerning the media and said the statement was more a threat than a mere statement.
Former Media Minister and MP Keheliya Rambukwella said one of the key pledges made by the newly elected government was to establish media freedom but government leaders were openly pointing fingers at media personnel while threatening them.
Members of the present government criticized some of our actions with regard to the media and came to power by promising a change in attitude. The people voted for them expecting such a change, but this has not happened so far, he told a news conference.
He said they already witnessed the true nature of our current leaders and some of them were known to oppress people.
During our time, we may have had our disagreements with journalists during news briefings etc. but we didnt continue the argument afterwards. But today, we can see open threats to them, he said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

Pan Asia Bank crosses Rs.1 bn PAT
	
Pan Asia Banking Corporation PLC saw its post tax profit for the year ended December 31, 2015 (FY15) increasing by as much as 151percent to surpass the key milestone of achieving a billion rupee profit. 
The bank closed the year with a post tax profit of Rs.1.04 billion well supported by the above average growth in gross loans and advances, higher margins and improved efficiency.
The earnings per share has risen to Rs. 3.53 from Rs.1.41 a year ago. 
Meanwhile for the quarter ended December 31, 2015 (4Q15) the bank has increased its after tax profit by as much as 110 percent to Rs. 289.6 million. 
The bank has grown its net loans and receivables by as much as 40 percent or Rs. 23.9 billion during the year to Rs.84.2 billion. This is by far the highest growth in net loans and advances recorded by a licensed commercial bank in 2015.
This is also above the economys private sector credit growth of 24 percent for the first eleven months.
Commenting on the results in 2015, the banks Director and Chief Executive Officer Dimantha Seneviratne said the bank was able to record this exceptional performance due to proactive decisions and effective execution of strategies capitalizing on the opportunities in the macro-economy while managing the risks. 
This performance reflects the immense potential of Pan Asia Bank and our contribution to the economy where we have disbursed our funds in to all sectors and regions in the country. Our Retail, SME and Corporate segments reached out to all areas of the country uplifting many industries and living standards of the people whilst creating financial inclusion, he added. 

Outlier in RoE sphere
At a time when the banking sector Return on Equity (RoE) comes under pressure due to narrowing margins, Pan Asia Bank has continuously driven its return to its share holders up to 19.94 percent by the end of FY 2015, virtually doubling the RoE from 9.81 percent in December 2014. The banks RoE is now amongst the highest in the industry and beyond. 

Stronger core-banking performance 
The bank has made tremendous progress in its core-banking performance as its fourth quarter Net Interest Income (NII) has risen by 23 percent to Rs.1.04 billion and the entire years NII increased by 45 percent to Rs.3.96 billion.. 
Despite the pressure on banking sector margins, Pan Asia Bank has expanded its net interest margin to 4.34 percent from 3.82 percent in December 2014 due to prudent re-pricing and proactive assets and liability management.
In order to support its lending drive, the bank raised Rs.4 billion in debentures at very competitive rates which was oversubscribed on the opening day itself, demonstrating the strong confidence placed by investors on the banks current and future strategies.

Cost efficiencies at play
Despite increase in operating costs in absolute terms, the bank continued to bring down its cost-to-income ratio to below 53 percent from 61 percent in December 2014 through introduction of lean management practices, process automation and eliminating non-value adding activities in the processes.
The Return on Assets was doubled to 1.14 percent during FY 2015, further demonstrating the effectiveness and the quality of the banks assets.  

Hundred billion asset base through quality portfolio
Pan Asia Bank recorded a significant milestone in surpassing an asset base of Rs.100 billion by end September 2015 keeping its promise to its stakeholders. 
In effect, the banks balance sheet has grown by 35 percent or Rs.28.2 billion to end the year at Rs. 107.8 billion. In perspective, the banks assets have grown more than five folds in just 6 years as the banks asset base by the end of FY 2009 was just under Rs.22 billion.
Meanwhile the deposit base of the bank grew by 20 percent or 12.8 billion to Rs. 77.7 billion.
Further, in September 2015, the bank completed its re-financing green facility with the Global Climate Partnership Fund (GCPF) by taking the receipt of US $ 10 million (Rs.1.43 billion) re-financing which strengthened the FCY funding of the balance sheet.
Despite the higher precautionary provisions for possible loan losses, in a noteworthy move, the bank managed to further improve its asset quality as both its gross and net non-performing loan ratios declined to 4.84 percent and 3.26 percent respectively from 5.73 percent and 3.78 percent in December 2014. 
Capital adequacy levels  both Core Capital and Total Capital ratios remained at 7.82 percent and 12.30 percent respectively by the end of FY 2015, well above the regulatory minimums of 5 percent and 10 percent respectively.

UNP also focusing on a third level leadership: Ranil
	
Focusing on the future prospects of the United National Party (UNP), Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said today it was time to prepare a third level of leaders to take over the party when the senior leaders retire.
We have already established a second level leadership. It is now time to have a third and fourth level leadership because we will also have to retire one day," he told party organizers in the Southern Province.
"The new leaders will have to take over so that we the senior leaders can rest and come out only during the election time," the Prime Minister said.
He recalled that former president J R Jayewardene, who took over the party in 1973, initiated a second level leader in former president R. Premadsa and third level leaders such as Lalith Athulathmudali and Gamini Dissanayake.
It was like a three-wheeler with Mr. Premadsa at the front and Mr. Athulathmudali and Mr. Dissanayake at the rear with me was the spare wheel. Mr. Athulathmudali and Mr. Dissanayake left the party while Mr Premadasa was killed resulting in the party being run on a spare wheel for 20 years," the PM said.
He said the party would be revamped by the time it celebrated its 70th anniversary and added that a membership drive would be launched before April this year.
Ministers Sajith Premadasa, Sagala Ratnayake, Vajira Abeywardena and Dilip Wedaarachchi were present when the premier spoke about the future of the UNP party.
He said it was essential to continue the national government so as to resolve the burning issues of the country. We will have to make the best use of the alliance between the two main political parties and as such don't not criticize us for allying with the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP), he said.
"We could be proud of this government only if we are able to resolve the burning issues faced by the people and the country," he said.I know that UNPers have issues and I cannot resolve those by just signing a document." (Yohan Perera)

We have a right to express our views: GMOA tells PM
	
A day after the Prime Minister hit out at the Government Medical Officers' Association (GMOA) and certain media institutions, the GMOA said it hoped Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe would realize that as a professionals association it has the right to express its views on any relevant matter.
Rejecting the Prime Ministers claims that the GMOA was backing former president Mahinda Rajapaksa, the GMOA said it was disappointed over the Premier's statement.
GMOA Secretary Dr. Nalinda Herath said they never expected Mr. Wickremesinghe who is an experienced and professional politician to make such irresponsible statements.
The GMOA is a non-political organisation which speaks up in matters which affects doctors and patients in the country. Whether it is done by the government or any other organization, we will leave no room for any individual to change our stance. This is the very first time that our organization had been faulted by the country's leaders. The image of the Prime Minister has been tarnished by this statement, he said.
The GMOA said despite any kind of opposition and obstacles, it would never stop its awareness campaign on the proposed Indo-Sri Lanka Economic and Technology Cooperative Agreement (ETCA).
The Government Dental Surgeons Association (GDSA) President Nimal Karunasiri said the Prime Minister should maintain his good standing and reputation without using the vocabulary of politicians like Mervin Silva and S.B. Dissanayake.
He said they were shocked at the tone of the Premiers statement and never expected him to refer to the GMOA in such a way.
Engineering Associations President Gamini Nanda Gunawardane said when the professionals organizations attempted to draw the governments and peoples attention to a very serious matter like the ETCA, the Prime Minister spoke on some unnecessary matters in a futile attempt to sweep the matter under the carpet.
