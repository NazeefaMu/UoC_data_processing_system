Ayurveda cures For sure, but the long queue is killing
	
Ayurveda Specialized Treatment Centre boasts of curing patients with many complications
As a result of negative experiences that several ayurveda chicaneries have created, people had lost faith in ayurveda (a form of alternative medicine). Situated amidst a busy street alongside Duplication Road in Colombo 03, is the Ayurveda Specialized Treatment Centre that offers treatment. The success associated with this centre is underscored by the fact that the medical facility is hustling with patients from all ethnicities throughout the day. The centre promises excellent service and effective treatment. In fact, the quality of the treatment administered has resulted in more patients turning up with the hope of treating various maladies. The only down-side that has resulted due to the upsurge in patients at the centre is that its limited staff and facilities cant cope with the demand for treatment. The authorities at the centre now face the challenge of operating the facility smoothly and managing the regular patients without a hassle. 
People now prefer natural methods of treatment
Its quite astonishing to see the large number of patients who have resorted to ayurvedic treatment for various ailments. Over 4000 patients seek treatment from us at the centre monthly. Everyday we treat about a 150 patients, said Dr. K. A. Nirosha Tharangani, Senior Medical Officer, CMC
Dr. Tharangani, who treats patients at the ayurvedic centre, told the how the centre came into existence. The department of indigenous medicine has implemented 16 ayurvedic centres in Colombo, which include one in Kollupitiya. The history of Ayurveda Specialized Treatment Centre in Kollupitiya dates to a time even before the 1960s, she said. 
According to Dr. Tharangani human health is being infested by many bodily diseases. There has been a significant rise in non-communicable diseases. The doctor stressed that this is largely due to changes in the lifestyle patterns. Fast foods and unhealthy dietary habits, lack of exercise and mental stress are related to the problem. Dr. Tharangani stated that all these issues are addressed in ayurveda. Ayurveda teaches people how to lead healthier lifestyles being in harmony with nature. Ayurveda can treat diseases that range from nervous diseases and metabolic diseases to skin diseases and phlegm. The majority of patients that we receive suffer from conditions such as arthritis, diabetes and cholesterol. We also treat spondylosis, cervical spondylosis, migraine and varicose veins. I also recall a patient who suffered from leucoderma, a dermatological complication that results due to changes in pigmentation. Such patients also get socially stigmatized. However through ayurvedic treatment, she was able to get cured, said the medical officer listing the treatments offered by the ayurvedic centre. 
The CMC has always extended support to us. In time to come we hope to expand the centre and develop the facility and increase the staff so that we can accommodate a larger numbers of patients
They feared ayurvedic medicine as there were many myths associated with ayurvedic medicine. There was one myth in particular that ayurvedic concoctions damage the liver. This isnt true Dr. K. A. Nirosha Tharangani


The numbers of patients who opt for ayurvedic medicine over western medicine has increased over the years. Dr. Tharangani accentuated that unlike western medicine ayurveda has no side effects because ayurveda uses natural methodologies during treatment. At present more people prefer natural methods. She stated that people have lost their fears of approaching ayurveda.  Previously people were scared to approach ayurveda. They were hesitant to consume ayurvedic concoctions. They feared ayurvedic medicine as there were many myths associated with ayurvedic medicine. There was one myth in particular that ayurvedic concoctions damage the liver. This isnt true. I see that the myths associated with ayurveda have perished. Ayurvedic medicine is side-effects free and consists of only herbal and natural methods. No chemicals are included. Nowadays people are becoming aware of our efforts and prefer to seek natural treatments, she said. 
With the ascent in the numbers of patients seeking ayurvedic treatment, the centre is getting inundated daily. During a day we treat about 150 patients. Due to this increase, we are forced to limit the number of patients. We have resolved to stick to a number system to manage these patients. We ayurvedic doctors stress on the fact that if you seek treatment from us then you have to strictly adhere to our treatment and medications to obtain benefits. Initially people are quite hesitant to take herbal concoctions, but with time they get used to it. Otherwise they may not find positive results and they would be wasting the time of other patients as well because we have quite a large number of patients daily, said Dr. Tharangani. 
The centre promises excellent service and effective treatment. In fact, the quality of the treatment administered has resulted in more patients turning up with the hope of treating various maladies
Out of the 16 ayurvedic centres, the centre at Kollupitiya has received a lot of positive responses from patients. The limited space and staff seem to be the only handicap. Otherwise the centre is functioning perfectly. This medical officer mentioned that there are plans to expand the centre to offer the maximum service to patients. The CMC has always extended support to us. In time to come we hope to expand the centre and develop the facility and increase the staff so that we can accommodate a larger numbers of patients. I am of course very happy to serve patients here and we hope to see our services maximize for the betterment of the people,she said. 
The service and treatment provided by the staff at the centre have greatly satisfied many patients who were awaiting their turn to consult the doctors. Among the patients were individuals who had returned to the centre because they had positive experiences. There were also those who were visiting the centre for the first time, following recommendations. The feedback provided by the patients was quite positive. They requested that the facilities to receive ayurveda treatment be expanded. A patient can expect positive results

Based on the Medium Term Budgetary Framework 2018-2020 and the policy framework of the government, the General Treasury has conducted budget discussions with the line ministries and other spending agencies. Accordingly, budgetary provisions have been made taking into consideration of the total resource envelope available in 2018, Minister Samaraweera told the Cabinet in his memo.
"The expenditure provisions covered in the Appropriation Bill have been estimated at Rs.1,977,264 million consisting of Rs.1,308,939 million for recurrent expenditure and Rs.668,324 million for capital expenditure. In addition, provisions have been made under special laws to service public debt and payment of Widows and Orphans Pension etc, amounting to Rs.2,005,103 million. The provision requirement for Advance Account Activities is Rs.6,000 million. Hence, the total expenditure provision for 2018 without budget proposals to be introduced at the Second Reading of the budget is estimated at Rs.3,982,367 million," he said.
Minister Mangala Samaraweera has told the Cabinet, the revenue at the prevailing rate structure and foreign grants was been estimated at Rs.2,175,000 million and therefore, the total borrowing requirement from both foreign and domestic sources will be Rs.1,813,367 million.
The Appropriation Bill has been drafted by the Legal Draftsman with the Attorney General expressing the opinion that the provisions of the draft Bill are not inconsistent with the Constitution and the draft Bill is not subject to any prohibition or restriction imposed by the 13th Amendment to the Constitution and therefore the Bill may be enacted by Parliament.

CSE and SEC to host next Invest Sri Lanka Forum in New York
	
The Invest Sri Lanka Investor Forum organized by the Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) and the Securities and Exchange Commission of Sri Lanka (SEC) in association with CSE member firms and leading listed companies will be held on16th October at the Sofitel New York.
The forum is organized with the objective of promoting investment in the Sri Lankan capital market among US based institutional investors and a strong interest among the investor community in the US is expected.
The Invest SL Forum hosted in New York in 2014 drew the participation of over 200 investment professionals and contributed to the year 2014 recording the highest annual purchases in the Sri Lankan stock market from the US. 
The forum will feature a keynote address by the Governor of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka Dr. Indrajit Coomaraswamy while SEC Director General Vajira Wijegunawardene and CSE CEO Rajeeva Bandaranaike will present on capital market regulation and the opportunities in the capital market respectively. The event will also feature a speech by CSE Chairman Ray Abeywardena and a presentation on the experience of investing in Sri Lankan equities by Senior Portfolio Manager at Times Square Capital Management Caglar Somek.
The presentations will be followed by a panel discussion moderated by NASDAQ OMX Group Vice Chairman Meyer Sandy Frucher and a series of pre-scheduled one-on-one/group discussions between fund managers and Sri Lankan listed companies on 16th and 17th October 2017.
John Keells Holdings PLC, Commercial Bank PLC, Sampath Bank PLC, Tokyo Cement (Lanka) PLC, Teejay Lanka PLC, Dialog PLC, Peoples Leasing & Finance PLC, MTD Walkers PLC and Sunshine Holdings PLC will attend the Forum.
The decision to host the Invest SL event in New York, comes on the back of a considerable level of foreign activity in the stock market in 2017, where a net foreign inflow of Rs. 40 billion has been recorded year-to-date in the primary and secondary markets. Foreign purchases during the first half of 2017 also established a record for the highest foreign purchases recorded in the first half of a calendar year. The year-to-date figure amounts to over Rs. 80 billion. Investors from the US have consistently been the leading contributors to foreign turnover in the Sri Lankan stock market, and have contributed to 40 percent of the total foreign turnover since the year 2013.
Commenting on the initiative, Chairman of the SEC Thilak Karunaratne said Every countrys stock market has its own mix of investors. This mix will have an impact on the efficiency of the stock market. This year in particular it is the foreign investors who have driven the stock market and to date there is a net foreign inflow of Rs. 28 billion to the CSE.
This is the second highest yearly net foreign inflow on record. The US is ranked as the number one contributor to this record figure and we are confident that this Road Show will further strengthen the inflow of funds from the US to our stock market.
The Chairman of CSE Ray Abeywardena commenting stated, Numbers related to foreign activity indicate that foreign investors have identified an opportunity in the Sri Lankan stock market. Considering such interest and activity, a forum of this nature in what is largely regarded as the largest Fund Hub in the world would help make a strong case for the Sri Lankan capital market, at a time when we have the attention of foreign investors.
I invite stockbroker firms, Unit Trust companies, listed companies and other stakeholders to join in this effort to make a collective case for the Sri Lankan capital market as an investment destination, Abeywardena added.
The forum follows successful Invest SL forums conducted in Australia this year, which have contributed to 2017 establishing an all-time high in foreign purchases originating from Australia in a calendar year.
An attractive market valuation (P/E), the growth potential among listed corporates, an encouraging performance of the ASPI and an investment environment free of taxation on capital gains are among the defining factors in attracting foreign investments to the Sri Lankan capital market.

Does anyone need to tell us what is good
	

This is shallow, casual and anarchic thinking that has washed over the world like a plague. So much so that each time I have thought there cannot be anything more vicious than that, there cannot be anything more terrible than that, there cannot be anything more disgusting than that
NO, we can think, say and do whatever we want most people say, adding, (if they feel kind) Bread is 60 bucks a pop, grandpa, ya can take it or leave it.
I have been forced to recalibrate lower. In every new time, clime and social sub-stratum I traversed, I saw people standing on their rights to what they want, screwing themselves, screwing the world and assailing me with new and improved versions of human viciousness.Clobbering me with bigger and better versions of human failure. Horror in human thought, word and deed was a bottomless pit I concluded. These days, be it politics, religion, education, ethnicity, medicine, finance, art, fashion and war; there are few men and fewer matters that can elicit more than an amused smile and casual shake of my head. Mildly tragic perhaps, but nothing really surprises me anymore. But one. 
Quality surprises me. Nay. The presence of quality in people, ideas and things shocks the living bejesus outta me. And I was surprised to say the least when I came across it in an article by GaminiAkmeemanatitled Math, Idiocy and All Those Sums Which Dont Add Up. He and I both seem to share a mutual regard for Robert Pirsig and his book Zen and the art of motorcycle maintenance. Taking me back to the meat of the book itself and Pirsigstortuous route to understanding the meaning of quality, that article put in sharp relief, its most lasting takeaway for me.
Towards the end of the book, in what I consider to be its most powerful and dramatic chapter, he asks What is good, Phaedrus and what is not good, need we ask anyone to tell us these things. This is both the apex question and the rhetoric answer to the question what is quality where this quality in described in terms of the Greek word aratmeaning moral value. Gaminis article triggered meto write about that idea of quality. Here goes: 
It is tempting to leave this question in the realm of Sophism and rhetoric where Pirsig left it. I would be justified in walking away with a vague sense of easy unease that the question was completely and fully answered -not through the convenient method of actually answering it but rather, by expanding the potency of the question-answer matrix to the point where any dialectic answer would be the silly indulgence of the church of reason and its henchwoman  rationality. Yet, we have moved on from a hundred years ago when guys like Pirsig was battling these issues. More importantly, we, as easterners, know that our dharma licked this problem of quality yonks ago through ways of seeing (dharshana or philosophy) that the west (Pirsig included) found difficult to understand.
We used a whole body of material generally described by such words as sathdharma, saarachiththa, sathguna, sathyakriya to explain moral value. Rather than delve into thecomplex intricacies of these terms, I will give an idea of aratthrough a comparison of how the meaning of a set of key social tasks and those assigned to execute them have changed over time. Those that I choose for this example are the ones associated with protection and the reason I choose them is that they are the foundation upon whose strength all societies and all nations either fly or fall. 
The things that protect us and make us safe, we value over all else. The people that protect us and make us safe, we revere above all others. There are four ways in which we are protected and there are four types of people who use them for our protection. 
We are protected by knowledge, we are protected by truth, we are protected by medicine and we are protected by the material requisites of food, clothing, shelter and security from physical attack. Until quite recently, these factors, also known as the four societal shields against disaster, were deemed so critical that they were provided to all for free. The first was provided by teachers, the second by the renunciates, the third by healers and the fourth by the kings. 
Gurukama, pavidikama, vedakama and rajakama as we used to call them protected us. I use the past tense here on purpose. Not too far back, kings thought, spoke and acted in accordance with the kingly virtues and disciplines (raaja dharma, raajavinaya) and similarly, written edicts of virtue and discipline governed the way in which the other shield bearers engaged society. The basis for those codes of conduct were simple: they were put in place to make sure that every thought, word and deed of the societal shields served to protect and succor the people and make their lives more content, more even, more stable, more sober.
Therefore, they were callings, often thrust upon people because of proven ability and never considered to be livelihoods. Their practitioners were the aristo or the best, as Pirsig notes. Their conduct increased, every day, the trust and love that the people had for them. For that they were revered.  Now, instead of kings we have leaders. Instead of healers we have doctors. Instead of teachers we have educators and instead of monks we have clergy. The differences among them are devastating.
Whereas the earlier crop had these vested upon them to protect society, the present crop take these labels on simply to protect themselves. They set themselves out to become leaders or doctors or teachers or clergy and quite apart from being shields for society, they want society to protect them. Through that very desire they prove that they are the worst. The filth. The slime. The dregs of society. Defaulting to conduct that lacks both value and morality.
All the while, they also insist that their self-serving hollowness is given the same status as that of the protectors of yore and that they too are similarly worshipped. Compounding the insults they heap upon society, they also insist that everything reduces to money and therefore they are merely cats paws of those who have it. They damage. They destroy. They give us, day by day, increasingly more terrible examples of human mediocrity and failure. Sucking almost all people into their horrifying vortex of disaster, they wipe out whatever goodness remains in them. Their conduct increases the doubt, suspicion, anger and hatred people have for them. For that they are reviled. 
Taking the above comparative example folks, as Asians,steeped in our dharmic tradition, cocooned in our dharmic ethos, we do not need to be told what is good. We know. But that knowledge has been subsumed, marginalized, ridiculed and finally eliminated from societal ordering by a set of shield bearers that sit, not upon thrones of honour but rather, upon their brains. Let us therefore resolve to redeem ourselves and reclaim our knowledge. Our heritage. Our legacy. Let us, my friends, resolve to blow away the clouds of ignorance and webs of deceit that have trammelled our vision for decades and see our true worth. Our true quality. Our true arat.

Dont hold polls this year: Govt. tells polls commission
	
The government has informed the Commissioner of Elections not to hold polls till January next year, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said today.
Mr. Wickremesinghe revealed this at a meeting he had with the Colombo District Public servants at Temple Trees last morning to educate them on the governments policies.
We have informed the Elections Commission not to hold elections this year so that MPs could concentrate on the 2018 Budget. Accordingly the polls will be held in January after Parliament completes its important business with regard to the budget, the Prime Minister said.
The Prime Minister who elaborated on the budget 2018 said it will focus more on women. We will include several programmes for women in the budget, he said.
Mr. Wickremesinghe said the government has decided to appoint a woman development assistant for each divisional and provincial secretariat office shortly. Women account for 52 per cent of the countrys population while 75 per cent of those who work in the divisional secretariat and provincial secretariat offices are women. Therefore it is appropriate to give women a chance to play some role in the state machinery. We hope that men will not file human rights petitions, the Prime Minister said.
Further he said the county would see more women representation in local government bodies when the rule which makes the political parties bound to field a minimum of 25 per cent women candidates. Further he said the country will also see a new electoral system based on 60 per cent first past the post system and 40 per cent proportional representation being implemented for the first time. This system will be introduced to Parliament as well, he added.
Home Affairs Minister Vajira Abeywardene said the best public servants to implement the present governments policy are the ones who were appointed by the previous regime. He said they were the best as they have successfully carried out polices of the previous regime.
Deputy Minister of Home Affairs Nimal Lansa said the public servants have to play a great role in carrying out government policies in the grass root levels.(Yohan Perera)

National Freedom Front (NFF) leader Wimal Weerawansa said today the government was planning to pass the Bill on the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearances in parliament on September 21, which would endanger the lives of the security forces.
He said according to the 11th clause of the convention, the government was bound by law to arrest and hand over any security personnel to a foreign country if a case was filed against him in a court there.
If the convention was passed in Parliament, the government is bound to hand over even General (Rtd) Jagath Jayasuriya, who had a case filed against him, in a foreign country, he said.
He told a news conference that the United States or Britain had not signed the convention and added that India had not authorized it even though it had signed it.
The then foreign minister Mangala Samaraweera who signed the convention secretly is now planning to authorize it in parliament, he alleged.
He said the government was also planning to present the 20th Amendment to the Constitution in parliament on September 20 and get it approved to postpone the Provincial Council elections pretending that it was done to hold PC elections on the same day.
The government is planning to postpone the PC elections to three provinces which were to be held in September and elections to the other provinces as well. Elections cannot be postponed without a referendum, he said. (Ajith Siriwardana)

Florida residents return to discover Irma destroyed 90%  of homes in the Keys
	

Hurricane Irma evacuees are returning to Florida to find their homes ripped apart and flooded by the devastating storm - and millions face a long road of recovery ahead. 
Irma killed 12 in Florida, in addition to four in South Carolina and two in Georgia as it carved a path through the Unites States over the last week. At least 37 people in the Caribbean were killed by the storm. 
More than 20,000 troops and five naval ships have descended on the region to help with relief efforts and carry out search-and-rescue missions. 
While nearly all of Florida was engulfed by the 400-mile-wide (645-kilometer) storm, the Keys - home to about 70,000 people - appeared to be the hardest hit with 90 per cent of homes destroyed or damaged. 
I dont have a house. I dont have a job. I have nothing, said Mercedes Lopez, 50, whose family fled north from the Florida Keys town of Marathon last Friday and rode out the storm at an Orlando hotel, only to learn their home was destroyed, along with the gasoline station where he worked.  We came here, leaving everything at home, and we go back to nothing, Lopez said. 
President Donald Trump and First Lady Melania Trump are visiting Florida on Thursday to survey damage across the state. Glimpses of Irmas economic toll were emerging, with Florida saying 31 state agencies had already amassed nearly $250 million in preparation and recovery expenses.

Hayleys to acquire Singer Sri Lanka for Rs.12.5bn
	
Diversified conglomerate Hayleys PLC, continuing with its buying spree, yesterday struck a mega deal to acquire a 71 percent stake in leading consumer durables retailer Singer (Sri Lanka) PLC (SSL) in a whopping Rs.12.5 billion deal.
The Hayleys group, controlled by business magnate Dhammika Perera, last month acquired Sri Lanka Shipping Company Limited, in its quest to become Sri Lankas largest shipping and maritime company, for Rs.4.9 billion.
Hayleys yesterday said it entered into an agreement with Retail Holdings (Sri Lanka) B.V. (RHSL) to purchase its 231.8 million shares constituting 61.73 percent in SSL by itself and its nominee at a price of Rs.47 per share. Hayleys has also entered into a further agreement to purchase, either by itself or through its nominee, the balance shareholding of 35.5 million shares constituting of 9.47 percent held by RHSL in SSL, within a period of 12 to 15 months from the date of the initial transaction, at the option of RHSL at a price of Rs.47 a share.
SSLs net asset value per share as at June 30, 2017 stood at Rs.20.22.
SSL in a stock exchange filing said following the transaction, Hayleys will become its controlling shareholder and will be obliged to make a mandatory offer to the remaining SSL shareholders under the Company Takeovers and Mergers Code of the Securities and Exchange Commission.
The trading of shares of SSL and Hayleys on the Colombo bourse was halted yesterday pending announcements from the two companies.
Amid takeover speculations, SSL shares on Tuesday soared by Rs.8.10 to close at Rs.52.50.
RHSL is a subsidiary of Hong Kong-based Singer Asia, whose parent is Retial Holdings N.V. Apart from Sri Lanka, Singer Asia operates subsidiaries in Bangladesh and India. It had been speculated for some time that Retail Holdings N.V. was looking to divest its Asian operations.The subsidiaries in Sri Lanka and Bangladesh are retail businesses engaged in the distribution of a wide variety of household consumer durable products with consumer credit and other financial services.
The subsidiary in India is primarily a wholesale distributor of sewing and appliance products that also has a right to retail nationwide. SSL has three listed subsidiaries namely, Singer Industries PLC, Regnis Lanka PLC and Singer Finance PLC.
SSL weathered the slowdown in consumer demand during the first half of the year (1H17) as the group top line recorded a growth of 13.0 percent year-on-year (YoY) to Rs.13.1 billion. However, earnings for the period fell 60 percent YoY to Rs.545.1 million.
As at June 30, 2017, SSLs asset base stood at Rs.44.4 billion.
Meanwhile, the Hayleys group in its stock exchange filing did not mention how it would fund the acquisition.
The group is already highly geared and during the 12 months to June 30, 2017, group borrowings rose by about Rs.13 billion due to enhanced investments made in key businesses.
Hayleys in its stock exchange filing said it has been exploring opportunities in the consumer and retail sector. The Hayleys group has a consumer business under its subsidiary Hayleys Consumer Products Limited, which markets lighting products and solutions, photo imaging, healthcare and FMCG products.
Dhammika Perera owns a little over 50 percent stake in Hayleys PLC and functions as Co-Chairman of the group. His Royal Ceramics PLC, through its subsidiaries, which were acquired in 2013, enjoys over 80 percent share of Sri Lankas floor tile market. Companies controlled by Perera also have a monopoly in the countrys aluminium industry. He is also the largest shareholder of two banks and with the latest acquisition he will have three finance companies
under his umbrella.

High tech cheating
	
by Lalith Dhammika Mendis
The sensational revelation of the sophisticated scheme of cheating at the recently concluded GCE A/L examination speaks volumes about a deep-rooted socioeconomic ill prevailing in this country. There is much more than what meets the eye and what was unearthed could be much smaller than the proverbial tip of the iceberg. Authorities as usual will resort to all kinds of rigid measures to strengthen the entire gamut of controls put in place. This is to ensure integrity of public examinations to avoid repetition of similar incidents in future. Unfortunately any such control measures would only serve limited cosmetic purpose in addressing the root cause of the underlying rot that drives people to resort to extreme suicidal measures like what came to light. 
Miscreant father who masterminded the scheme with the connivance of a Tuition master would never have had an iota of a doubt that the whole stratagem would come a cropper costing his sons future in its wake. GCE A/L no doubt is one of the most of relentlessly contested examinations in Sri Lanka or perhaps in the world. It is the gateway to University Education and perceived as the divine stepping stone that paves the way for accomplishments. Sri Lanka has an unwritten rule to follow if one aspires to secure while collar job to be able to command standing in elite social circles.
The whole saga commences from the requirement of admission to a popular school or achieving success at Grade Five Scholarship exam to secure admission to a popular school followed by the indispensable need to succeed at GCE A/L to enter university to be eligible follow one a recognized stream of study leading to gainful employment.
The right to education is recognized in International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights adopted by the United Nations. Providing quality education without discrimination is one of the fundamental prerequisites to achieve inclusive growth. Education empowers individuals through necessary skills to be gainfully employed in the midst of growing competition. 
Sri Lanka is aspiring to become a globally competitive Middle Income country. This requires Policy makers to envision core strategies to remodel the economy to address the demands of a Middle Income country, and makes it imperative to develop an export led economy fueled by diversified sectors to enhance productivity and growth which entail the indispensable need to shift focus from traditional agricultural employment to emerging sectors promoting export led diversification and growth.
For that purpose it is of fundamental importance to improve the service delivery system in education to achieve qualitative improvement in manpower. Although Sri Lanka has made advances in Human Development Index (HDI) at rank 73, progress has been very slow. One of the key components of the HDI is quality of the education and Sri Lankas performance on this score has surely been lacking. 
Sri Lanka currently spends about 2% of the GDP on education, although promises were made during elections to enhance investment up to 6% of the GDP in line with the global norm to improve quality of education and widen its reach. Despite making lofty pronouncements obviously targeting electoral gains, budget for 2017 saw allocation for education being drastically slashed by nearly 60% from Rs 185.97 Bn in 2016 to Rs 76.94 Bn in 2017, a move that does not bode well for this vital sector. So it appears that highfalutin pronouncements about export led inclusive growth lookall lightening no thunder. 
Due to capacity constraints state universities are unable to absorb many students with adequate qualifications to pursue higher education. Moreover proper mechanisms could be developed to form Public Private Partnerships to establish institutions conducting study courses leading to qualifications and skills in a whole gamut of emerging sectors that offer attractive prospects for gainful employment in an economic model promoting inclusive growth. 
Enhanced funding would enable improvement and expansion of infrastructure, provision of better qualified academic staff, well equipped laboratories, libraries and information technology labs, quality sporting gear, play grounds, facilities for aesthetic studies and last, but not least adequate and proper facilities for sanitary needs etc to schools that would support more and more children to be absorbed to engage in quality academic and extracurricular activities to enrich in a variety of skills. It is well known that many schools even in Colombo and suburbs do not have proper and sufficient facilities of acceptable hygienic standard for sanitary needs.
Due to longstanding inequality in allocation of resources and lack of a national policy to gradually eliminate the yawning gap between so-called popular schools and the rest in terms of the quality of facilities and standard of teaching people strive to securing admission to popular schools using every means fair or foul. Moreover measures been hardly taken by successive regimes hitherto to dispel the deep-seated social anomaly that persons educated at popular schools who form part and parcel of whos who social circles in the society are of superior standard, which today serves as a crucial determinant in ones ability to secure gainful employment. So the rat race fueled by the zeal to succeed at any cost begins at Kindergarten and keeps gathering momentum through various stages such as Grade Five scholarship examination and GCE O/L finally culminating in GCE A/L where neck and neck competition determines only the very best would succeed. 
Despite many economic woes and fiscal issues affecting the economy funds are allocated for the purchase of super luxury cars, limousines and SUVs for politicos, whilst vehicle permits being generously issued to afford them the luxury of super comfort conveyance. All this happens while common man who commutes by public transport has to periodically pay more out of meager earnings and contend with good-for-nothing services at the hands of reckless and unruly private bus operators. Has any politico demonstrated genuine concern about common mans plight and shown austerity on his part in using public funds Answer obviously is in the negative. 
People of this country under successive regimes have suffered due to colossal blunders and profligacy committed by the rulers of the day. There are monumental examples such as southern port and airport, miles and miles of idling roadways without traffic, colossal buildings structures and conference halls with hardly any use, iconic structures such as lotus tower that dont promise any economic gains and multi-purpose development project like Uma Oya which has ruined the day to day lives of people in the vicinity that have devoured huge chunks of public funds borrowed at exorbitant costs burdening the poor tax-paying majority. Funds have been generously allocated for such grandiose schemes whilst priority areas such as education and health being given step-motherly treatment. So it is doubtful if the Govt is truly acting in furtherance of the professed goal of achieving inclusive growth. 
In the context of neck and neck competition at GCE A/L, burning zeal in people to see their offspring succeed to secure an opportunity for state funded higher education leading to recognized qualifications, people resort to all kinds of measures fair or foul to bring long held dreams to fruition. Many execute ingenious plans and modern technology no doubt comes in handy in such sinister schemes although such manipulations contravene morality and laws. 
What lies before the public eye is a case of suicidal aberration to achieve success at any cost. It no doubt would mar the life of the youngster and attach an indelible black mark on him at the very onset of exuberant youth. So, it is essential that due process of law takes its course to get the right message conveyed to the society. However that alone would not address the longstanding socioeconomic ills that drive people to make such desperate moves, which still remain unresolved due to callous opportunistic politics predominantly practiced in post independent Sri Lanka. 
The solution lies in curing fundamental ills to create wider scope of opportunities for advancement through multiple avenues through the implementation of sustained progressive goal oriented policy measures. People would fall in line and desist from violating rules when they realize that commitments would bear fruit not go waste and there are multiple avenues to achieve success.

Megapolis Ministry got no power or money from govt.: Minister
	
Megapolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka today lamented that the government had neither given a cent to his Ministry nor an authoritative power for Western Development though the Yahapalana Government completes two years on Sunday (17)
Minister Ranawaka however added that all social development, transports and environment related projects and mega construction programmes were carried out with no prejudice and malice with any one.
Addressing a ceremony held to lay the foundation stone to build New Green City on Kirimandala Mawatha in Narahenpita, Minister Ranawaka said the cabinet approval has been given to develop a New Green City at the venue comprising all facilities, amenities, infrastructure and a transport network.
The Green City will become another smart city within Colombo and a transport center once it is completed. This will be constructed as a model to follow when other cities in the country are developed. The adjoining Kerawalapitiya will become the center that provides answers to solid waste disposal in Colombo and satellite cities.
Minister Ranawaka said it was a victory for Trade Unions who were instrumental to change certain clauses in the Port City agreement in favour of Sri Lanka and as a result, the government must not bear any cost to construct the Port City.(Sandun A Jayasekera)

Sri Lankas Google Loon dream still alive: Harin
	
The Google Loon dream of the current government is still alive, with Telecommunication and Digital Infrastructure Minister Harin Fernando set to make a renewed effort at negotiations with the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) for the rights to use the frequency band required for the project.
The ITU has some concerns. Google was a bit worried that it was taking time but right now for the same band, I think Malta apparently has got the approval. So, Im supposed to go to the ITU and again make a submission, that the same band has got it, so why cant we have the approval Fernando outlined his plan. Google Loon is all set to launch in Indonesia as well. Fernando said that if the ITU gives the approval, Sri Lanka will have to reapply for Google Loona project which aims to beam down wireless Internet from high altitude balloons hovering over key locations of the country.
He said that he has no idea about the reasons of the ITU for refusing to allocate the required 700MHz spectrum frequency band for Google Loon. The government hoped to make Internet accessible for households currently without access to Internet, especially in rural areas, as part of the governments vision to create a digital economy.
Balloon test flights were conducted by Google over Sri Lanka and business models and several phases of the project were developed, at no cost to the government.
Rama Corporation, the Sri Lanka government and local telecom service providers formed a joint venture company to provide services through Google Loon.
Rama Corporations Chamath Palihapitiya pitched the Google Loon idea to President Maithripala Sirisena in 2015 and Palihapitiyaa hotshot in the Silicon Valleylocally gained notoriety for his motives with the project and ridicule for the numerous delays, for which he publicly lashed out at the local media last year.
According to him, the project was forecasted to increase the countrys gross domestic product (GDP) by 1.2 percent per every 10 percent of the population that gains access to the Internet through Google Loon.
The project has run into numerous delays and it is not yet clear what the exact reasons for these delays are, since the government blames the ITU, which in turn said that the government had not properly communicated the requirement for the project with it. (Chandeepa Wettasinghe)

Sri Lanka should ensure Nasheeds safety: Amal Clooney
	
Human rights lawyer Amal Clooney has urged Sri Lankan authorities to ensure the safety of her client and former President of the Maldives Mohammed Nasheed.
Her message comes in the wake of recent remarks made by Mohamed Hussain Shareef, Males Ambassador-designate to Colombo, that he would have Mr. Nasheed arrested if the latter set foot in Sri Lanka.
In a recent interview to a local television channel in Male, Mr. Shareef reportedly said: If a Maldivian authority requests me to detain and return Mohamed Nasheed back to Maldives, I will. Its very simple. They have to say this is an individual who we are seeking. Ill even go out to the street myself and do it if our authorities inform me, request it of me, our embassy will enforce it.
Responding to his comment, Ms. Clooney said that any attempt by a Maldivian diplomat to detain Mr. Nasheed in Sri Lanka would constitute a violation of international law as well as Sri Lankan criminal law. President Nasheed should not be returned to the Maldives to serve a sentence that resulted from a sham trial, and it is incumbent on the Sri Lankan authorities to ensure that his rights are respected while he is in their country, said Ms. Clooney, according to a statement issued by Mr. Nasheeds office. Sri Lankan authorities have not responded to the development so far.
Pointing to the arrest and deportation of a Maldivian blogger in Sri Lanka in 2015, Mr. Nasheeds Maldivian Democratic Party said the Mr. Shareefs remarks could not be taken lightly.
Mr. Nasheed, 50, was the Maldivess first democratically elected head of state and served four years as President. He was convicted in 2015 on terrorism charges following a trial that many, including the UN Group on Arbitrary Detention, criticised. In 2016, he flew to London on prison leave for medical treatment and was granted asylum soon after. Since then, he has been travelling frequently to Sri Lanka. In August 2016, he secretly flew from London to Colombo to firm up plans with fellow dissidents to unseat President Abdulla Yameen, but their attempt failed.
The Maldivian government has come under sharp focus over the last year, with sections accusing the Yameen administration of turning increasingly authoritarian, a charge his government denies. In July this year, UN Secretary-General Antnio Guterres urged the Maldives Government to refrain from acts of harassment, intimidation against parliamentarians, civil society and the media.

Sugathapala Senarath Yapa: The man and his camera A tribute to the first one-hit wonder of our cinem
	
In 1968 and 1969 a series of films that went down as the most poignant love stories ever shot here was made, and released. Most were directed by those who were already established in the industry: G. D. L. Perera (Dahasak Sithuvili), Dayananda Gunawardena (Bakmaha Deege), and Lester James Peries (Golu Hadawatha).
In hindsight, I believe it was no coincidence that towards the end of the most classical and continental decade (since most of our directors, by then, had been shaped by the tradition that had earlier shaped Renoir and Ray) these three should have been made. They would be followed by the more politically turbulent seventies, a decade of lopsided perspectives, jump cuts, and provocatively un-classical, jerky editing. (Perhaps they needed a set of love stories for us to get fully prepared for them.) 
The enduring appeal of the other film among them, Hanthane Kathawa, released by Torana Video Movies last year, is derived from its polymorphous quality: its so fresh, so original, that it HAD to be made by someone who got into the cinema because he grew up on the movies. (Two of the other directors had, by contrast, grown up on the stage.) Seeing Hanthane Kathawa after all this time (The Sooriya Village screened it on Sunday, September 3) hence makes one wonder about the man behind it. 
Sugathapala Senarath Yapa was born in Akuressa in 1935. Both his parents had died when he was quite young; he would be brought up by his grandmother, a generous woman as he remembered later. This absence of a proper authority figure meant that his childhood was, again as he remembered later, rather boisterous, which reached unforgivable heights when, together with a friend of his called Abeywickrema, he spread a rumour around his first school, Rakvana Maha Vidyalaya, that the buns which were being served to the children during the interval were filled with worms. The outcry against the administration of the school this provoked, and the subsequent discovery of the two culprits, meant that the principal had no choice but to expel Yapa: out of one school, he got into another with Pelmadulla Central College. 
This would be followed by a second encounter: with his cousin, the comedian L. M. Perera, who got him into another Touring Cinema as a counter clerk
Pelmadulla Central was headed by a stern but well meaning principal, A. V. Gunapala, a member of the Hela Havula. He had one message for young Yapa: no more antics; stick to your studies. He heeded it and got through his SSC Preparatory Exams. When he was pondering as to what to do next, however, a quirk of fate (one of many that adorn the lives of people like him) would prevent him from continuing his education. The school he intended to join for his SSC Exams, St Anthonys College, rejected him, while the Rector, Father Moses, told him to wait for one year. Because he would have spent that year wasting away and playing around with boys his age and getting beaten up by them, though, he decided to abandon his schooling. 
Before the concept of the cinema hall evolved in Sri Lanka (and India), the theatre was limited for the most to your nearest city. In other areas there were touring cinemas, which was an offshoot if not amalgamation of the peepshow and the circus. So since the hall was limited to the city, Yapa had to do with these moving theatres, which considering the tastes of his neighbourhood screened the usual populist stuff: Bollywood romances, Hollywood thrillers. Yapa would get to see the entire Zorro series, then get his first job as the companys film title-painter. That led him to an encounter with the owner of the touring hall, Reggie Perera (the then MP for Lunugala), who upon seeing his flair for drawing, asked him to pay him a visit. Which he did, and which led to him being hired as a kind of advertiser for his company. 
This would be followed by a second encounter: with his cousin, the comedian L. M. Perera, who got him into another Touring Cinema as a counter clerk. While he was working there, he sat for his clerical exams, passed, and shifted to the Labour Department. This was propitious: long, long before the independent cinema was born here, our most avid artists emerged from the clerical service. It wouldnt take long for Yapa, a child no more, to get involved with the arts through his job, starting with a set of radio dramas that included a translation of Tagores Gora. 
The radio service helped him meet Mahagama Sekera, and eventually helped him land a role in a newly established drama troupe headed by G. D. L. Perera, Kala Pela. The role, however, wasnt in a play, but in a film: Pereras debut, the beautifully searing Sama, which also saw the debut of Denawaka Hamine and Leonie Kothalawala. 
Having become Secretary and Treasurer of Kala Pela, Yapa later abandoned it, determined to strike his own path in the movies. In his first few years at the Labour Department he had made it a habit to visit the British Council and the Regal Theatre, to move away from what he had encountered at the Touring Cinema. This too was propitious: the fifties, when he was beginning his career in the arts, was the decade that nurtured Italian neo-realism, Satyajit Ray, and Akira Kurosawa. 
In his own words, what he saw during these years made him aware that the cinema was built, not always on overt action, but rather on fleshed out individuals who kept their intentions hidden away from plain sight. De Sicas Bicycle Thieves and Kurosawas Rashomon influenced him greatly in this regard, since both films are, after all, about such individuals: in the former, a father and son who are reluctant to reveal themselves to one another, and in the latter, witnesses to the murder of a samurai that no one, not even the dead samurai himself, can truthfully speak about. 
Five years later Ediriweera Sarachchandra staged Maname. 10 more years later, Colombo screened Antonionis Blow-Up, which would influence another artiste, the architect Tilak Samaraweera (who would soon make Antonionis homeland his surrogate motherland) and Polanskis Knife in the Water, which depicted a terse, claustrophobic love triangle between two men and a woman. Having seen Kurosawa, Sarachchandra, and now Polanski, Yapa borrowed elements from all three, compounded them, and, in 1969, directed his first film. Hanthane Kathawa was the 218th movie to be made here; nothing like it, given the directors background and its rich, polymorphous outlook, had been made before, or would ever be made again. 
There are filmmakers who are so original that they dont care about what they are doing: from the American cinema I can think of D. W. Griffith, Howard Hawks, and John Ford. Then there are directors who, while original, fall in love with the movies so much that their first few films are a tribute to the masters of the medium they had grown up on: again from the American cinema, I can think of Peter Bogdanovich, William Friedkin, and Quentin Tarantino. Of the latter three only Tarantino remains potent, persistent, while both Bogdanovich and Friedkin, after their first few films, slid out of sight, since the kind of cinema they were shaped by was from an earlier, gentler era: Bogdanovich with Hawks and Ford, Friedkin with Hitchcock and Clouzot. 
For me, hence, there can be no other reason as to why, even with Hanthane Kathawa, Yapa slid away unnoticed like these two later on: his film owed its mood to a romantic, classical conception of the cinema, one which, in his own words, was soon attacked by directors who believed that THEIR cinema was the only true one. 
That his debut was so significant for Yapa was proved by another victory that same year: the Silver Peacock at the New Delhi Film Festival, for his first documentary (really a docudrama), Minisa saha Kaputa (a study of human greed). That the fact it went unnoticed proved to be his downfall can be gleaned from his subsequent work: two films, despairingly commercialist in their outlook (Pembara Madu and the much better Induta Mal Mitak), and 28 other documentaries for the Government Film Unit. These were supplemented by occasional stints at writing lyrics (earlier in Hanthane Kathawa he had done the impossible: bring Mahagama Sekera and Premasiri Khemadasa together for a song he himself partly wrote: Sara Sonduru Mal Patali). 
The raw material of the cinema is life itself, Satyajit Ray wrote. If that raw material seems too processed and refined today, its because our directors (at least most of them) dont believe in life, and think their audiences dont either. Pauline Kael once noted, quite correctly, that when the American cinema became liberal in the fifties, it confused morality for art; the opposite is true for our cinema, today: the lack of morality, or the rebellion against it, is equated with profundity, which is why our movies dont seem to be felt, but rather force you to feel them (a paradox). 
What Ray said, and how what he said has been rejected today, was echoed the other day when Sugathapala Senarath Yapa told me the most inspired thing a director from his era could have as an aside on our cinema: Dreams have become extensions of reality. The movies were born out of those dreams, but those dreams were never meant to replicate life. Yapa had directed our 218th film, one among a great many more, which reflected quite aptly just how the medium had got reality and fantasy, the worldly and the extraordinary, the real and the romantic, to cohabit. That it went by unnoticed, along with the man behind it, says a lot, I should think. Even today.

UK-based GMC rejects SAITM graduates
	
The General Medical Council (GMC), an independent organisation in United Kingdom to protect patients and improve medical education and practice, recently rejected the registration of graduates from South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine in Malabe.
Issuing a statement titled Overseas medical qualifications not accepted by the GMC, it said that the body would not accept applications to sit the PLAB test or for registration from graduates of the medical schools mentioned in it including the SAITM.
We do not accept qualifications on the unacceptable list. There are a number of reasons as to why a qualification may be added to the list of qualifications which are not acceptable which include where we have information that demonstrates the qualification does not meet our acceptability criteria, where there are questions about the acceptability of the qualification and, after investigation, we cannot obtain sufficient information to satisfy our selves that the qualification is acceptable, it said.
We also do not accept where we receive information about irregularities relating to the programme of study or the awarding of qualifications and cannot obtain sufficient information to satisfy ourselves that the qualification is acceptable, it added.
Meanwhile, speaking to the Daily Mirror, SAITM Registrar Husni Hussain said that they had recently received a letter from the GMC stating that the SAITM would no longer qualified to get registered at the GMC.
Hussein said that GMC has issued this letter following an application by a SAITM graduate seeking for its registration and added that the GMC had rejected the SAITM since the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) had not recognized the SAITM as a medical degree awarding institute.
As another reason the GMC has mentioned that a pending court case is there with regard to the SAITM. However, they had mentioned that they would consider their approval on SAITM once afore mentioned issues get sorted out, she added.
Issuing a statement, contrary to the statements that were currently being circulated within the media, the SAITM clarified that the Head of Registration Applications of GMC, Richard Amison had confirmed the qualification criteria and acceptance of applications from SAITM graduates to the GMC would be reviewed as and when the concerns in question was resolved.
As clarified by the GMC to SAITM, it states that it is not in a position to determine any of the legal or factual issues involved, but will proceed to review the quandary following the direction of the Government of Sri Lanka and other legal institutions. SAITM further informs that they are in par with the necessary requirements for graduates to apply to the GMC, he added.
It also said that the SAITM had been represented to the GMC by the SLMC to halt SAITM graduates from applying.(Kalathma Jayawardhane)

Welikada Riot Threats Mount, but Key Eyewitness Refuses Detractors to Blur His Vision
	
In the absence of a speedy criminal investigation or the complete implementation of recommendations given by several committee reports, the fight for justice regarding the inmates killed during the 2012 prison riots is still continued by a group of people among whom is key eyewitness Sudesh Nandimal Silva, who was in remand during the riot. 
Despite the fact that this particular incident impinged on the entire law and order and justice system in Sri Lanka, the current Government akin to the previous regime isnt showing a real interest on clearing the mess, Nandimal claimed. What happened in the prison on November 09 and 10 in 2012 was transpired by various people.
The complaint charged the relevant officer who had allegedly asked Nandimal whether he was trying to send former Defence Secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa to jail
Nandimal is pioneering the campaign and has frequently been threatened and intimidated. The intimidations and threats directed at the witness, which started with telephone calls, have now taken a physical form. Files which contain details of previous complaints by him, regarding threats, which are with the police, remain untouched. 
There is a recent incident reported last week that some unidentified gunmen opened fire at Nandimals residence in Moratuwa. Nandimal assumes that the shooting incident might be the last warning for him as he continues the fight. This is despite four previous incidents where he was threatened using various means. 
What makes him point fingers at the current Government is the silent approach taken by the Sri Lanka Police to provide adequate security for him, because the safety of his life is vital given that he is one of the main eyewitnesses to the shootout at Welikada Prison.
History of threats
1 - Weeks after he gave testimony before the CID in 2015, two men in a vehicle followed his motorcycle for several days. They had reportedly visited his workplace and inquired his whereabouts from security guards. The vehicle number, noted down by the guards, was later found to be of a vehicle belonging to the Police Narcotics Bureau, Nandimal claimed. This finding was established in an investigation launched by the Maligawatta Police on my complaint. However the inquiry didnt proceed thereafter, he said. 
2 - Three individuals wearing caps had whistled and called him over when he was going to the junction in Moratuwa to get a reload for his phone on October 2, 2015. Two of them reportedly threatened him on that day, urging him not to take up the Welikada case. They had stated if the case was taken up, some of them would have to end up behind bars. Nandimal had lodged a complaint with the Moratuwa Police. No investigation was initiated, he said. 
3 - The third incident, as claimed by Nandimal, was regarding a radio programme which had allegedly been aired to sling mud at him and threaten him for carrying on a fight to ensure justice regarding those affected by the Welikada riots. The so-called presenters of this radio programme branded me as a Sinhala Kotiya (Sinhala tiger). I have a family. They faced many difficulties after the programme was broadcast. I lodged a complaint against the radio programme with the Police Division for the Protection and Assistance of Victims and Witnesses. The Police Division recorded statements from me, he remarked. 
4 - Nandimal lodged a complaint with the Police CID after he faced the fourth threatening incident where he was allegedly threatened by Chief Engineer of Operations (Sub-Department) of Sri Lanka Railways Nilantha Fernando on July 19. The complaint charged the relevant officer who had allegedly asked Nandimal whether he was trying to send former Defence Secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa to jail 
I tried to talk to him about sending me on a ridiculous transfer to Kandy. He asked me as to why I was so bothered about the slain prisoners and rather threateningly said that people like me shouldnt survive in the world. Nilantha is an affiliate of Gotabaya Rajapaksa, Nandimal claimed.
12-11-10 Welikada
Many social activists predict that the book 12-11-10 Welikada authored by Kasun Pussawela, one of pioneering journalists who wrote about the Welikada inmates deaths, will give goose bumps to the powerful characters, said to be behind the shooting incident. 
Speaking to the Daily Mirror, Kasun Pussawela, a journalist working for Ravaya, said the purpose of writing this book is merely to inform the general public with in-depth stories relating to the Welikada riot where 27 inmates died. 
The book, based on reports compiled by Pussawela and published in Ravaya and Irudina newspapers, has provided a voice for parents of slain inmates, members of committees appointed by the Government to probe the issue, inmates who were at the scene, but managed to save their lives, inmates who witnessed deaths of many inmates, the then powerful Former Defence Secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa, Former Minister of Prisons and Rehabilitation Chandrasiri Gajadeera and Former Justice Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe whose comments are included in the book, Pussawela said. 
Pussawela added that the book would mark a significant point in history since the shooting itself is recorded as one of bloodiest incidents in the country. The book launch is scheduled in the evening of September 15 at Mahawela Centre, Colombo 07 with the participation of Senior Journalist Victor Ivan and Constitutional Lawyer Srinath Perera. 
Nandimal said a suspicion arises in his mind whether the current Government is making an attempt to protect the culprits because the relevant Government authorities havent taken measures to ensure the safety of his life thus far. 
He also stated that the alarming risk to his life demonstrates how the suspects of the Welikada inmates killings fear going behind bars. 
It is the police and the other relevant authorities who should decide on what degree of security and which way it should be provided to me. All I want is them to ensure the safety of my life, he stated. In the absence of a response from the Government to his demand thus far, Nandimal raised a question from the Government, Is this Government waiting for me to be killed
If the police is unable to provide protection to Nandimal over any reason, it is a terrible failure of the countrys law and order system, Prominent Human Rights Lawyer J.C.Weliamuna PC told the Daily Mirror. 
He didnt agree with Acting OIC of the Victims of Crime and Witnesses Assistance and Protection Division SP Heraths statement that an assessment on threats should follow the decision on witness protection. 
I dont agree with him. If they dont want to provide protection to some witnesses, they can use this so-called explanation on the importance of a threat assessment. It is an old saying. Due to the fact that he was also an inmate at the time of the Welikada riot, some might think it isnt that important to provide police security to an ex-inmate. Needless to say that Nandimal is a very vital witness for proceedings of this Welikada case in future, he said. 
Weliamuna PC outlined that laws and mechanism are there to take appropriate action in order to ensure the safety of witnesses and informants. 
They might talk about practical difficulties. However, they should find ways and means to do their job without finding reasons not to do it, he remarked.
Under certain legal provisions provided in the Victims of Crime and Witnesses Assistance and Protection Act, No.04 of 2015, a threat assessmentshould be done prior to providing police protection for the witness, Acting Officer in Charge of the Victims of Crime and Witnesses Assistance and Protection Division, SP Herath said. 
A threat assessment is done to analyze and assess the nature and level of threat a particular person has, in order to decide whether the person requires police protection and what degree of protection should be provided. SP Herath said even though the case is very serious, they are unable to make hasty decisions because it is mandatory for them to comply with the requirements given in the Act of Victims of Crime and Witnesses Assistance and Protection which underlines the importance of an assessment on threats. 
According to him, at the moment, body-to-body protection by the police or tri-forces is provided only for VIPs including politicians. 
He added that they would make a final decision after the threat assessmentwhich will be analyzed by the National Authority for Protection of Victims and Witnesses. 
Meanwhile, Officer in Charge of the Victims of Crime and Witnesses Assistance and Protection Division SSP G.J.A.Wijesekara said the Police Division which was set up last November still hasnt been entitled with certain authorizations to take a big step in terms of providing protection for witnesses.
The Police is encountering practical difficulties in providing police protection to Sudesh Nandimal Silva, Police Spokesman ASP Ruwan Gunasekara said. 
It is impractical to deploy police officers for his protection. In that case, we will have to provide him with transport, which is also impractical. He will have to travel with police officers wherever he goes. I dont think it is a prudent move, he said. 
He said the police would rather inquire into Nandimals complaints regarding threatening incidents and take appropriate legal action against culprits.

Wont allow privatisation of fisheries harbours: Amaraweera
	
Responding to a statement made by MP Vijitha Herath on Monday (11) with regards to the privatisation of fisheries harbours, Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Minister Mahinda Amaraweera yesterday said that none of the fisheries harbours would be privatised or leased out to private firms.
Addressing a media briefing, he said that the JVP MP had been misled about what was contained in the Cabinet paper which was categorically envisaged only to allow both private and government sector investors to launch development projects within the harbour premises.
He further said that Cabinet approval had been sought not to privatise or to lease any of the fisheries harbours but to set the stage for local investors to initiate productive investments which would not harm the livelihoods of fishermen around them.
In addition, he stated that if any foreign investor wished to launch a project here, he or she must go for a merger with local investors as they would not be allowed to launch any project alone. (Sheain Fernandopulle)
