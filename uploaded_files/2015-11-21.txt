<U+200B>Enter MS, exit MR
	
President Maithripala Sirisena?s presence at the tea party after the budget and the quick exit of former President and Kurunegala District MP Mahinda Rajapaksa avoiding the reception were notable features in Parliament.
MP Wimal Weerawansa who also boycotted the reception was seen making a quick remark that he did not understand a single word of the budget speech made by Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake. ? I did not understand a word but I will go through the documents and see whether I could learn something,? he told journalists who gathered around him to get his views.
Mr. Rajapaksa also made a similar comment but added that the budget was not an appealing one. ?Meka Melo Rahak Nethi Ayawetak,? he was heard saying.
However Opposition MPS Dinesh Gunawardene and Vasudeva Nananayakkara were seen at the reception.(YP & AS)

<U+200B>Govt lifts ban on several banned LTTE outfits
	
	?
By a gazette extraordinary issued on Friday, the Sri Lankan government lifted the ban on several outfits and individuals previously thought to have been working for the LTTE.
On March 21, 2014, 16 organizations and 424 individuals were proscribed under the UN Act No: 45 of 1968. But the latest gazette notification bans only eight organizations and 155 individuals.
The de-listed organizations are: Global Tamil Forum (GTF); British Tamil Forum (BTF); National Council of Canadian Tamils (NCCT); Tamil Youth Organization (TYO); World Tamil Coordinating Committee (WTCC); Canadian Tamil Congress (CTC); Australian Tamil Congress (ATC); Tamil National Council (TNC).
Organizations which are still banned are: the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE); Tamil Rehabilitation Organization (TRO); Tamil Coordinating Committee (TCC); World Tamil Movement (WTM); Transnational Government of Tamil Eelam (TGTE); Tamil Eelam Peoples? Assembly (TEPA); World Tamils? Relief Fund (WTRF) and Headquarters Group (HQG).
Enunciating the Sririsena government?s policy on proscriptions, Foreign Minister Mangala Samaraweera had said in parliament on March 18: "Reviewing this list of individuals and entities is an important exercise at this juncture when the government of President Sirisena is seriously committed to expediting the reconciliation process.".
The initial proscription by the Rajapaksa government was done in haste, and was not subject to a rigorous process of assessment and verification, the Minister pointed out.
"It was done to build up hysteria about LTTE regrouping. There was hardly any tangible evidence to link them to the LTTE. Some of those sought had died," he said.
The present government? calculation is that Lankan law enforcement and intelligence agencies will now be able to target their resources more accurately and purposefully. The government is legally committed to reviewing the list annually and the expectation is that organizations and individuals who publicly abjure separatism and violence will be de-listed.
Canada accounts for the single largest number of wanted persons. 22 of the wanted are in Canada. Denmark comes second with 17; Sri Lanka 14; UK and the Netherlands account for 12 each; France 11; Germany 8; India 7; Italy 4; Malaysia 3; Norway 2; US, 1 and Thailand 1. The wanted man in the US is Visuvanathan Rudrakumaran, head of the Transnational Government of Tamil Eelam (TNGTE). Interpol Red Notices stand against 26. The two Sinhalese among the wanted are Gunaratna Bandula Gajaweera of Akkaraipattu and A.Chaminda Darshana of Trincomalee. The latter is believed to be in India.
Apart from Gajaweera, others believed to be hiding in India are: Sivaganasundaram Sivakaran; Aganila alias Gemini; Amuthan; Suresh alias Kapil Msater; Rajendran Murthy; Velupillai Revathan; Vigneswaran Parameswari.
It is significant that the Gazette notification de-listing half of the proscribed organizations and 63 percent of the proscribed individuals, was issued a day ahead of the visit to Colombo of Samantha Power, the US Permanent Representative in the UN in New York, an expert on genocide and an advisor to President Barack Obama.(New Indian Express)

## Title: India-Pakistan may play in SL or Bangladesh?

India-Pakistan may play in SL or Bangladesh?
	
	?
Calcutta: The possibility of a bilateral cricket series between India and Pakistan in either Sri Lanka or Bangladesh cannot be ruled out.
?
At the bilateral level, the two countries have not played each other since January 2013.
?
According to well-placed sources of The Telegraph, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) is actively looking at playing in one of the two neighbouring countries.
?
Shashank Manohar, the BCCI president, is also the chairman of the International Cricket Council, which is headquartered in Dubai. He?s got to keep the bigger picture in mind as well.
?
The MoU between the BCCI and the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) was signed when Narayanswami Srinivasan was at the helm on this side of the border.
?
Going by the MoU, India?s committed to playing Pakistan and the next series would have the status of ?home? for the PCB.
?
Once things firm up, a formal proposal would be placed before the PCB, which is headed by a former foreign secretary, Shaharyar Khan.
?
Khan?s roots, incidentally, are in India.
?
Manohar and Shaharyar are expected to meet in Dubai on Saturday/ Sunday. While the former has left for the Emirate in his capacity as chairman of the world body, Shaharyar is there for the ongoing Pakistan-England matches.
?
The UAE has become Pakistan?s home venue after the attack (in Lahore) on the Sri Lanka team bus, in March 2009.
?
Thus far, the Indian and Pakistani Boards have rejected each other?s proposals. Both sides have left no scope for any compromise on their publicly stated positions.
?
?
India have said ?no? to playing in the UAE; Pakistan?s stand has been the same on again touring India.
?
The 2012-13 face-offs were hosted by India.
?
As it?s supposed to be a home series for the PCB, they?ll obviously look at the revenue model before saying ?yes? to either Sri Lanka or Bangladesh.
?
Both Sri Lanka and Bangladesh don?t have a home series between the first week of December and the first few days of January ? the period during which India and Pakistan are supposed to play each other.
?
If India and Pakistan do agree to revive bilateral cricket on neutral ground (after the mandatory clearances from New Delhi and Islamabad), then the matches can be played in either Sri Lanka or Bangladesh.
?
Sri Lanka appears the more likely venue, as the BPL would be on till December 15. Then, Bangladesh are to host a Test series against Zimbabwe from January 5 or thereabouts.
?
Besides, there have been security-related issues in recent times, with Australia even deferring their tour of Bangladesh.
?
As far too many factors come into play, in relations between India and Pakistan, one can?t predict anything with certainty. However, both Sri Lanka and Bangladesh would be delighted to host such a high-profile contest.
?
India and Pakistan, by the way, have to reach Australia and New Zealand, respectively, by January 8.(The Telegraph)

Indian fishermen in SL custody: Jayalalithaa writes to Modi
	
A day after 14 Tamil Nadu fishermen were arrested by the Sri Lankan navy for crossing the International Maritime Border Line (IMBL), chief minister J Jayalalithaa on Friday sent a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi seeking his immediate intervention.
"It is unfortunate that, in yet another incident, 14 fishermen who set sail from the Rameswaram and Mandapam fishing bases in Ramanathapuram district on three boats were apprehended by the Sri Lankan navy in the late hours of November 18. They have been taken to Kankesanthurai, Sri Lanka," said Jayalalithaa in the letter.
The chief minister also said on November 8, four fishermen on a motorised country boat who drifted and got stranded on the Sri Lankan shores due to engine failure were yet to be sent back to India.
"Already 47 fishing boats along with fishing gear, which are essential for fishermen to earn their livelihood, are still in the custody of Sri Lankan authorities and have not yet been released. The impounded boats that are perilously berthed face the imminent threat of damage due to long periods of disuse and the onset of the monsoon," Jayalalithaa said.
The chief minister once again raised the issues of Kachchatheevu and the comprehensive special package for deep sea fishing.
"The livelihood issue of thousands of our fishermen needs your personal intervention. The central government should not allow this issue to fester further. I request you to take immediate action through diplomatic channels to secure the release of the 14 Indian fishermen and 50 fishing boats from Sri Lankan custody as well as to ensure the early return of the four fishermen," said Jayalalithaa.

Mixed reactions from ministers and MPs
	
		 		 
		 
			
The 2016 budget presented by Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake drew mixed reactions from Parliament with government members hailing it while the opposition, said it failed to meet expectations.Opposition Leader R. Sampathan 
It seems a development oriented budget. Most of the proposals seem acceptable.Industry and Commerce Minister Rishad Bathiudeen
It is one of the best budgets, and has granted relief to the people by reducing prices of essential commodities. Funds have been allocated for education and health as never before.Media Minister Gayantha Karunathilake
The budget presented by Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake is development oriented, and that it places no burden on the ordinary people. Every sector in the country has been considered in the budget.?Sunil Handunetti MP ? JVP
The economy has been opened up extensively without much protection for the local industries. The government will end up with nothing by trying to perform magic. One has to be sensible in dealing with the economy. The government should follow other countries which have protected local industries without opening up the economies to the fullest.Dinesh Gunawardena MP - UPFA
The government has not presented a budget that meets the expectations of the people, but it is an ideal budget for foreigners. The budget speech clearly stated that the government would raise funds by printing money, which is detrimental to the economy.
This is not a budget expected by government servants and the people. It will adversely effect the rupee, the cost of living and cause inflation. Economic hubs have been proposed to be sold to foreign companies directly. The government has not fulfilled its pledges to tea, rubber and paddy cultivators.Eran Wikramaratne MP - UNP
Privatization is not a sufficient solution. All strategic institutions will be under the government and the private sector will be allowed to participate in non-strategic enterprises. A Public Wealth Trust will be set up and this trust will hold shares of some enterprises on behalf of the public.Udaya Gammanpila MP - UPFA
This is a set of fairy tales just like the January 29 budget. Rs. 1.5 billion has been allocated for the development of each Grama Niladari Division. There are 14,200 Grama Niladari divisions. A sum of Rs. 22 trillion is needed for this, but the total allocation is less than that, and therefore insufficient. The government?s estimated revenue is Rs. 2 trillion. The Minister of Finance has not done his homework. Funds have been allocated to build hospitals for kidney and cancer patients. But prevention is better than cure.

<U+200B>Questions over attack on Maldives man in SL
	
		 		 
		 
			
Despite the arrest of a three-wheel driver in connection to the attack on a Maldivian man in Colombo last week, new information has raised question marks over the attacker.
Usman Nooraddeen, 45 of Thaa Atoll Vilufushi island was in critical condition as he had suffered severe head trauma in the mugging, his family had said.
He has since been transferred out of intensive care.
A family member had earlier told Haveeru that Usman was attacked while he was on his way home after shopping. He was attacked by the driver of the three-wheel which he was travelling in, the family member had said.
However, according to new information that came to light during the investigation, the three wheel driver is seemingly not connected to the attack itself.
A family member quoting Sri Lanka police said, Usman was found by a security guard in an empty parking lot near the Nawaloka Hospital in Colombo.
The guard had sent the injured Usman to the hospital in a three wheeler, the family member said.
It is believed that Usman's phone and the money was near him when he was found. The money, according to the family, was stolen by the three wheel driver en-route to the hospital.
So questions have now arisen over the attacker as Usman was already injured when he was entrusted to the three wheel driver to be taken to the hospital.
The driver is believed to have had stolen USD6,000 and Rs.50,000 from Usman.
"The driver did not confess at first. But the security guard had claimed that the money was inside the wallet when Usman was put in the three wheeler. Lanka police found the wallet from the driver's mother as he had given it for safekeeping," the family member said.
The driver remains in custody after he confessed to robbing his injured passenger. Police have now handed over the recovered money to Usman's family.
The family said the truth behind the attack will only be clear once Usman is able to give his statement. Though he is now out of intensive care, he is still unable to speak properly, the family said.
"He has a skull fracture. But he is slowly recovering," the relative said.
Usman is in Colombo to meet some family members before leaving to India for his child's operation.
The attack comes in the wake of the brutal stabbing murder of a Maldivian man in Sri Lanka.
Razeen, who is a notorious former gangster, was found dead with stab injuries in an abandoned paddy field near the Tumbovila Bridge in Piliyandala on November 5.?
Two suspects -- a Maldivian and his Sri Lankan accomplice -- have been taken into custody.(Haveeruonline)
