Well-wishers to buy vehicles for his escort fleet
	
	
	A security chief once close to the former strongman has turned spiteful to him now, they say. Under the new administration, an adequate security detail has been assigned to the former strongman, but part of the fleet of vehicles was withdrawn. And as a result, some of the security guards are compelled to find other means of transport when the need arises for them to escort the former strongman.
Given this problem, the present security chief of the former strongman made a plea to his predecessor now elevated to a higher position to assign a few more vehicles for the transport of the security detail led by him.? ?
?No more vehicles to escort your boss. You had better manage with the vehicles already available,? was the security high up?s curt reply.
Later at a reception accorded to him at a Buddhist temple in the city, the former strongman told a sympathetic audience that some of his security men were compelled to travel by train and bus for want of vehicles. A report says that some well-wishers on this occasion decided to buy a few vehicles to beef up the escort fleet of the former strongman.

A battle that adds value to opposition juniors
	
	The battle over the main opposition chair is raging with the two rival groups ? one backing the incumbent and the other championing the scion of Boralugoda -- engaged in a keen signature-collecting competition, they say.
The signature-collectors have now made it a practice to even visit the homes of Diyawanna members at the periphery for the purpose.? It was 12 midnight when a group of signature-collectors backing the incumbent called at the residence of a Diyawanna member in the Mahiyangana area the other day. Meanwhile, certain opposition seniors who never cared to greet their backbenchers with a nod or a smile in the lobby or the canteen are all smiles when they meet the latter these days. The long neglected backbenchers these days know what would follow a hail from certain seniors: ?Malli, please sign this list.?
The other day one junior Diyawanna member was heard telling a colleague:? ?Machang, we must think of some way of prolonging this fight over the main chair.? After all, doesn?t it give a good value-addition to our status?

Govt. contradicts itself so we voted against: SLFP
	
SLFP General Secretary Anura Priyadarshana Yapa said today they defeated resolution to raise the Treasury Bills threshold because the Finance Minister had informed Parliament that they had enough funds to pay salaries thus contradicting the Government?s earlier reason for the need of a bond issue.
He asked why the Government needed to raise the TB threshold if it had enough funds and said the Government had acted in a callous and arrogant manner during the debate without showing any semblance of cooperation.
Mr. Yapa said neither the Finance Minister nor the Prime Minister were present in the parliament during the voting.
?When the government clarified that the Bill was to pay the salaries of state employees, we agreed to support it. However, the Finance Minister had maintained throughout the entire debate that they had adequate funds to pay salaries and started lashing out at the opposition. How can the Government expect us to vote in favour of the resolution after such behavior,? he told a news conference held at the SLFP head office in Colombo.
He said the SLFP members were not prepared to raise their hands in agreement to each and every regulation forwarded by the United National Party (UNP).
Meanwhile, SLFP Senior Vice President and Chief Opposition Whip W.D.J. Seneviratne said the resolution was defeated to condemn the approach by the government to gain the support of the opposition.
Commenting on the 19th Amendment to the Constitution, he said the fundamental rights of the people would be violated if the Amendment was presented in the Parliament tomorrow without giving room for the people to study it.
?We are completely against the government?s move to present constitutional reforms on April 9 and 10 hastily. It keeps adding more reforms to the reforms already gazetted and submitted in the Supreme Court,? he said adding even they were clueless as to what had been inserted in the 19th Amendment.
Mr. Seneviratne reiterated that the SLFP would not support the 19th Amendment if the electoral reforms were not brought simultaneously. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

Former strongman?s advice: ?Make it a grand show!?
	
	
	Organising this year?s May Day celebrations has set a poser to the Blue party now in political no-man?s land, they say.
The veteran trade unionist Alavi who played the lead role in organising the party?s May Days in the past will have nothing to do with this year?s celebrations, a party source said.
According to this source, Alavi considered as a faithful follower of the former strongman has been sidelined and Artful Amare from the Deep South has now been tasked with organising the event.
Amare is said to have suggested to the new party leadership that they go solo this year and further the venue of the rally be a relatively small ground like the Hyde Park.
The former strongman, on hearing about the proposed move to scale down this year?s celebrations, called Amare and told him to turn this year?s May Day rally into a grand show at a spacious ground like the Galle Face Green like in the good old days. ?After all, this is going to be the first May Day to be celebrated since our new government taking office. Don?t insult our party by holding the May Day at a small venue hardly befitting the status of our party,? he exhorted Amare.
?Our opposition chief also approved the proposal,? an apologetic Amare told his former Boss.
The former strongman greeted this reply with a loud guffaw. ?O! Is that so? They say I am a patron of the party. That is why I thought of giving this bit of advice!? he added.

Soon after that powwow, the former Deputy faded from the political scene.? Neither his former Boss nor his close friends could meet him or reach him over the phone.? Intrigued by his reclusiveness, a group of Diyawanna colleagues made discreet inquiries and they chanced upon the reason for it; he is going through a brief period of orientation before accepting a portfolio in the new government!

Lankan drowns in Sydney
	
	A Sri Lankan, holidaying in Coffs Harbour from Sydney died at Sapphire Beach on Monday after he was pulled unconscious from the water.
	Police said a post-mortem examination would seek to determine whether the Sri Lankan man, aged in his 50s, drowned after losing consciousness due to a pre-existing medical condition.
	Coffs Harbour City Council's Lifeguard Services team leader Greg Hackfath said Monday's tragedy highlighted the dangers of swimming at unpatrolled beaches.
	"We urge swimmers not to be complacent in the water and to stick to surf safety rules," Mr Hackfath said.
	"Lifeguards and our water safety partners will be doing everything possible to prevent further tragedies occurring, but we need people to act responsibly and use commonsense when enjoying the beach.
	"Know your ability and if conditions are testing, then don't push your limits."
	The tragedy followed an eventful weekend on local beaches that saw three tourists saved from a rip at Diggers Beach.
	Coffs Harbour professional lifeguard Alex Swadling came to the aid of the three swimmers who found themselves in trouble outside patrolled areas on Friday.

	Leader of the House and Minister Lakshman Kiriella said today the voting on the increase on the Treasury Bills? threshold showed a split among members of the opposition.
	?Yesterday we realised this situation in the opposition and it is clear that some opposition members are supporting the government while some are not. However every member in the opposition had assured they would support the government to secure the objectives of its 100-day programme,? he said.
	The minister said that according to Opposition Leader Nimal Siripala de Silva, the opposition would support the government to get the resolution approved but several members of the same opposition had voted against it.
	?We don?t know whether the decision was taken after discussions between two groups or if a rift exists in the opposition. But it is totally contradictory to parliamentary traditions,? he said.
	?The government is keen on issuing Treasury Bills and Bonds locally and raise the local borrowing threshold to meet its expenditure since Government spending has increased while the revenue has decreased because of the salary increase to government employees and the price reduction of fuel, gas and other essential items through the interim budget,? the minister said.

	This popular Buddhist monk virtually blazed the trail for the new government to come to power. He is now highly disillusioned with the doings of the new authorities whom he once backed with all his might.
Recently, this hamuduruwo heard that a certain female medical officer, a daayika of his temple, serving at a hospital located in a distant place ? a highly uncongenial station in the official parlance -- had fallen victim to a chronic disease. She had told the monk, that if she were transferred to a hospital close to Colombo, it would enable her to readily obtain the specialized medical care and treatment for her illness.
The monk thereafter had asked the authorities to give this female doctor a transfer to a hospital in Colombo considering her plea on humanitarian grounds.
However, the request by the monk is said to have fallen on deaf ears, they say.?
