Adding insult to injury
	
?
The nation had to suffer the worst disaster in recent years when?flash floods and landslides wreaked ?havoc destroying thousands of houses?and taking a heavy toll of human and animal life.?
?
At this grave hour, everyone looked up to the Disaster Management authorities to swing into immediate action to provide whatever relief they could with the least delay.?
The establishments in the corporate sector, NGOs and some individuals rising to the occasion lost no time in saving life and property and providing relief to the affected people. However, the disaster management authorities who should have given leadership to relief and rescue operations passively looked on for several days while death, misery and suffering were rampant in the Galle, Matara, Kalutara, Ratnapura, Gampaha and Colombo districts.
The State apparatus remained inactive because the authorities were unprepared to face a minor emergency let alone a disaster of massive proportions, they say.?
The authorities had failed to hold stocks of basic humanitarian needs such as bottles of drinking water, blankets, life jackets, mobile toilets, umbrellas, candles and boxes of matches.?
There was only an official available to answer queries from the media and the public at the office of the highest political authority in charge the subject.?
What was worse, the political authority responsible for disaster management appeared to have made himself scarce.
It came to light later that he was at a global conference in Mexico waxing eloquent about a programme he had launched to minimize the damage caused by natural calamities just when the disaster hit the country.?
Many are of the view that the political authority concerned had added insult to injury by keeping away from the country for several days knowing very well that the country was in the throes of a major disaster.

Attackers named in London terror probe as PM under pressure
	
?
LONDON AFP June5, 2017- Police identified two of the London attackers on Monday after Britain?s third terror assault in less than three months, as Prime Minister Theresa May came under mounting pressure over security just days ahead of elections. ?
National counter-terrorism police chief Mark Rowley named two of the three slain assailants as Khuram Butt and Rachid Redouane, revealing that Butt had been known to security services. ? The aftermath of Saturday night?s rampage, which left seven dead and dozens wounded, dominated the campaign trail ahead of Thursday?s general election. ?
Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said he would support calls for May to quit, as she had overseen a sharp reduction in police numbers in her past job as interior minister. ?
The attack, claimed by the Islamic State group, saw three men wearing fake suicide vests use a white van to mow down people on London Bridge and then slash and stab revellers enjoying a Saturday night in the bustling Borough Market area. ?

Celebrating birthday amid death and destruction
	
?
It was the people of the Kalutara and Ratnapura district who suffered the most from the recent floods and landslides.
?
With a funereal atmosphere pervading the entire country, a rash of posters appeared overnight on walls in Colombo and Kalutara. The posters carried the picture of a prominent politico ? an official mouthpiece of yahapalanaya ? grinning from ear to ear. A legend below the picture read: Ciram Jayatu! (Long life to you!)
It was a poster wishing happy birthday to the politico. On seeing this poster which smacked of almost blasphemy given the general mood, people had expressed their disgust with the lament ?Ane Apoi! Mehemath minissu!? It had come to light later that it was a loyal follower of the politico who was behind the ?birthday wish campaign?. However, it was too late for the politico to undo the damage, they say.?

The Chief Executive Officer of Perpetual Treasuries Ltd., Kasun Palisena, who was present inside the Bond Commission while evidence relating to the phone conversations that took place between him and Bank of Ceylon Treasuries Division, Chief Dealer Mr. Dharmapala were leading, was ordered to leave the Court room by the Commission.
The Commission advised the Counsel that appeared on behalf of Perpetual Treasuries Ltd., that he should have informed the Commission regarding Kasun Palisena?s presence, prior to the evidence relating to him being lead before the Commission.
Additional Solicitor General (ASG) Dappulada Livera argued that the Counsel?s conduct of not informing such a person?s presence inside the Commission was highly questionable, because Mr. Palisena could fashion his future evidence on the Commission listening to what Mr. Dharmapala said today before Court.
However, the Counsel officially apologized to the Commission and said it was not deliberately done as mentioned by the ASG, since his sole intention was to get instructions from Mr. Palisena in order to cross examine the witness, considering the time constraints of the Commission.

Debris from missing Myanmar military plane, with 116 persons aboard, found in sea, said reports. The plane had gone missing between Southern city of Myeik and Yangon.
Six ships and three planes were pressed into search and rescue operations of the crashed plane. The plane had lost contact with the radar about 20 miles west of Dawei town, reports quoted a military official as saying. It lost contact around 7:05 GMT.
The plane was reportedly carrying 105 passengers and 11 crew. In 2014, Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 disappeared on March 8, 2014, while flying from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing.
The aircraft, a Boeing 777-200ER operated by Malaysia Airlines, last made voice contact with air traffic control when it was over the South China Sea, less than an hour after takeoff. In 2016, an unidentified plane was thought to have plunged into the ocean close to Myanmar.
The search for that plane was later called-off after the aviation department did not receive any reports of missing aircraft from airlines operating in Myanmar airspace. (oneindia)

Vehicles which had the Cost, Insurance and Freight (CIF) value of more than US $ 25,000 imported or purchased locally, should not be transferred to any other party before the completion of five years from the date of registration, a circular issued by the Finance Ministry said.
While issuing the amended of the Trade Agreement Policy Circular No. 01/2016 dated on July 14, 2016 the Finance Ministry yesterday said the Trade Agreement Policy governs the import of vehicles for senior executives in management and administration at State institutions and State co-operatives.
The circular said the amendments had been made in accordance with the decisions reached during the Cabinet meeting held on May 2.
The circular dated retrospectively dated June 01 and affects vehicles imported since that date.
Accordingly, the maximum CIF value should not exceed US $ 30,000 or equivalent in any other currency as per the exchange rate that prevailed on the date of opening the Letter of Credit (LC).
This regulation is valid up to importation of a vehicle or purchasing of a locally assembled vehicle.
Vehicle Duty Waivers that were granted from November 20, 2015 until May 31, 2017 and vehicles that had received clearance from the Customs on or before May 31, 2017 cannot be transferred to a third party before being used for five years, except under the criteria mentioned in the circular.

REUTERS, 06th JUNE, 2017- Afghan leaders met officials of two dozen foreign governments and institutions on Tuesday, launching a so-called Kabul Process aiming to set the stage for peace talks and clinch an international pact to end ?cross-border terrorism?.
After a week of violence that included the deadliest ever attack on the capital of Kabul, President Ashraf Ghani said the meeting would be more than a ceremonial effort.
But with domestic tension high, international plans in flux, and the insurgency as powerful as ever, starting any peace process may be an uphill battle.
Underscoring the volatile situation, at least one rocket struck an Indian diplomatic compound in Kabul, as the delegations met a few blocks away.
Speaking to the diplomats, Ghani said the attacks in Afghanistan were part of the violence that had struck foreign cities around the world, most recently in London, where three militants drove a van into pedestrians on Saturday before attacking people with knives.

Cabinet Spokesman and Health Minister, Rajitha Senaratne said today a warrant has been issued for the arrest of Bodu Bala Sena leader Galagodatte Gnanasara Thera and CID detectives have been deployed to take him into custody over allegations of inciting religious and racial hatred.
Responding to a journalist at yesterday?s weekly news briefing, he said it would be a difficult task for the police to arrest him if he was being protected by a minister.
Journalist: There are media reports that he is being protected by a minister.
Spokesman: Possible. That is why the police have been unable to arrest him. Sri Lanka is not such a big country nor were there so many hiding places for him to hide.
Journalist: Why only Gnanasara Thera. Why don't the police arrest Tamil and Muslim racists?
Minister: He has been directed to appear in Court to answer allegations made against him by the Police. His language is extremely insulting and he has called Muslims Thambiyas and Marakkalayas. He has also allegedly attempted to incite people against other ethnic groups. The Muslim and Tamil politicians have not done that but have demanded their rights. Talking about your rights or making a statement to that effect will not create divisions among people.
Journalist: Mosques have been attacked even after Gnanasara Thera has gone under ground. That means he is not responsible for the attacks.
Minister: True. But anyone who wants to prove his innocence can attack a mosque.
He said some Eastern Muslim MPs met him recently to complain about the attacks on Muslims and he will discuss the matter with them shortly and appraise the President and the Prime Minister on this matter. (Sandun A. Jayasekera)

Leptospirosis - Silent killer  in the background of heavy floods
	
?
?
Sri Lanka faced one of the biggest natural disasters ever in its history with the recent floods, which led to the loss of life of many innocent people. Looking back at these devastating episodes, it is always better to think of how they could have been prevented beforehand so that the negative impact of mother nature could be minimized, while the natural balance of the environment is maintained. ?
The distribution of medical drugs secondary to massive flood relief campaigns are seen throughout the affected areas of the country. ?
If you have ever taken part in such relief or have listened to the news, Doxycycline is a very common name one hears nowadays. It tops the list of drugs which prevent the disease LEPTOSPIROSIS (Rat fever/ Mee una), a life-threatening illness, most likely to raise its head in the backdrop of heavy freshwater floods. ?
?
What is Leptospirosis?
It is a worldwide zoonotic infection where the pathogen is transmitted directly or indirectly from animals to humans. It is commonly observed in tropical and sub-tropical areas of the world. Leptospirosis characteristically peaks during rainy weather or flooding. ??
Incidence of the condition is higher among paddy farmers and according to the latest data, 3000-5000 people are suspected to be affected every year and many die from the disease (1-2%) if not diagnosed and treated properly. ?
Other risk groups: ?
Workers in coconut and sugar cane plantations, abattoirs and fish markets. ?
In Sri Lanka, suspected Leptospirosis is a notifiable disease and the Matara, Gampaha and Kaluthara areas have recorded the most number of cases in the recent past. ??
?
What causes Leptospirosis?
The main causative pathogen is Leptospires, which falls under the phylum of spirochaetes. These are found in the kidneys of animals such as rodents-rats and bandicoots and livestock (cattles, pigs) and wild mammals (rare in Sri Lanka). ?
Transmission of the infection to humans usually occurs by the exposure of abraded skin or mucous membranes (nasal, oral, eye) to water, wet soil or food and water, contaminated with urine from chronically infected yet asymptomatic animals, especially rodents. Once the pathogen enters the blood stream and invades all the tissues and organs of an individual, the symptoms may appear following 1-2 weeks after the initial exposure, and can occur even before that since the incubation period of the pathogen is found to be 2-26 days (average of 10 days). ?
How do patients present symptoms?
Leptospirosis is a self-limited systemic infection or a severe, potentially fatal illness accompanied by multi-organ failure. ?
Initial symptoms (mimic mild flu and Dengue fever)
?Abrupt onset of fever with chills and rigors ?
	?Muscle pain (calf muscles, neck and back) ??
	?Headache ?
	?Cough ?
	?Nausea and vomiting associated with diarrhea ?
	Conjunctival suffusion (red eyes and tenderness of muscles which appear on the third day of fever, characteristic but non-specific) ?
It is important to be aware of these initial features, in order to seek immediate medical advice before serious complications begin. We have noticed that most patients misinterpret these constitutional symptoms as simple viral fever and tend to ignore them, after which it?s really hard to manage them. ?2nd phase
This follows a short period of apparent well-being of the patient and occurs due to body?s immunological response to the infection. ?
Complications
?Aseptic meningitis (Inflammation of the protective layers of brain) ?
	?Myocarditis (Inflammation of heart muscles) ?
	?Pneumonia ??
	?Interstitial Nephritis and acute tubular necrosis ??
	?Hepatitis (Inflammation of liver) ??
	?Jaundice (yellow eyes) ?
However, the good news is more than 90% of affected individuals with mild infection will recover spontaneously, even though some may progress up to an increased severity with kidney, heart and liver failure with wide-spread hemorrhage which would ultimately end up in death, if not managed promptly and properly (Case fatality rate -5%-30%: Epidemiological data). ?
?
?
?How are the patients diagnosed and managed?
Early diagnosis is crucial in managing patients with Leptospirosis. However, this can be quite challenging due to non-specific initial presentation and difficult lab studies. ??
Patients with suspected clinical signs and symptoms along with a history of an obvious occupational or recreational exposure should be tested for antibodies in blood and urine which will confirm the diagnosis. ?
The hallmark of the Leptospirosis treatment is antibiotics. ?
Suspected patients without any organ involvement or identified co-morbidities can be managed as out-patients and treated with doxycycline-100mg/12 hourly for 7 days. ?
High-risk patients with organ involvement or co-morbidities should be admitted immediately and treated with antibiotics; Penicillin, Ceftriaxone and Cefotaxime.?
?
What is the importance of Prophylaxis in Leptospirosis?
According to the national guidelines in Sri Lanka, prophylactic treatment for Leptospirosis can only be given under the proper guidance and monitoring of public health authorities. However, during the recent flood crisis, this treatment was highly encouraged in individuals to prevent possible wide-spread of the infection. ??
?
?Doxycycline 200mg once a week is the recommended dose and this should be started few days before the exposure and continued throughout the period of exposure. ??
	?Beneficial up to 7 days and if the risk continues, dose can be repeated under medical advice. ?
	?Doxycycline can be taken with or without food but preferably with a full glass of water. ?
	Strictly contraindicated in: ??
?-Children under 12 years ?
?-Pregnant and lactating mothers ?
?-Any previous allergic response to the drug ?Prevention and Control
?People engaged in farming, mining, cleaning drains and canals are encouraged to inform their respective MOH and PHI where they will be made aware about the disease. ?
	Controlling the population of rodents around human habitation through proper sanitation and cleanliness. ?
	?Individuals with possible recreational and occupational exposure should always wear protective clothing, knee-high boots and gloves, and wounds and bruises should be covered properly ?
	?Minimize walking in floodwater and getting involved in activities associated without any prophylactic treatment. ?

Margosa A miracle medicine to cure  cancer
	
?
By Gayan Suriarachchi
The Biology, Molecular Biology and Biotechnology Institute of the Colombo University claims that for the fist time in the world, they have found that a chemical compounds extracted from the Margosa (Azadirachta indica) plant are capable of destroying cancer stem cells. ?
The experts of the BMBBI say they were able to prove the capabilities of the substance extracted from the Margosa tree, which is regarded as a treasure of medicine through an internationally accepted advanced scientific research methodology. ??
Dr. Sameera R. Samarakone and Senior Prof. Kamani Thennakone led the research team comprising Dr. Meran Ediriweera, Dr. Punya Piyathilaka, Dr. Asitha Siriwardena, Kathika Mayan, Daniel, Rana Mohan, Laxmiga Tharmaraja, Uma Rajagopalan, Kaniska Senathila and Prof. Ira Thabrew. ??
Prof. Nedra Karunarathna and Dr. Nuwanthi Katuwawela assisted the research work by deploying Nano Technology techniques. ? ?The first stage of the research fund was received from the Biochemical Molecular Biology and Biotechnology Institute and the National Science Foundation is providing the financial contribution from the beginning of 2017. ?
?The chemical compounds presently being used to treat cancer is hardly effective in destroying the cancer stem cells. Therefore, in our research we were able to find new chemical compounds capable of destroying the specific protein that directly attributable to the growth of cancer. With such compounds, the cancer could be definitely eliminated?, an expert in the research team said. ?
?
?
?From the beginning of this research project in 2013, we have been engaging in the research process using 35 chemical compounds extracted from plants grown in Asia to find a chemical compound capable of suppressing the protein that causes the growth of cancer cells. Through this process, we deployed the advanced computer software. At this stage, we were involved only in the forecasting research.? ?
?We used the technique known as Molecular Docking with super computer technology. We were trying to determine how DNA, RNA and protein make changes in the cells of our bodies and the cells of plants, in combination with another protein or chemical compound.? ?
?The research process was similar to the ?lock and key mechanism?. However, we could forecast that the chemical substance found in the margosa tree is rich in medicinal properties which suppresses the stem cancer cells, after merging with specific protein in the cancer cells. We could also forecast the possibility of eliminating cancer using this compound?. ?
To affirm the forecast, the BMBBI research team later had to carry out tests using cancer cells obtained from a human embryo. It had shown the increased effectiveness of the chemical substance on cancerous cells over the chemical compounds used in clinics. ?We also did research to verify that it had no any adverse effects on the blood cells in the human body.? ?
?BMBBI also engaged in a separate research in parallel to ascertain the probable advancement of the medicinal properties of the compound deploying Nano Technology. In this process, inserting the chemical compound in specially processed nano particles was introduced to the cancerous cells in the breasts and lungs. This showed a tenfold increase of the medicinal property of the compound that was processed with the nano technology over the pure chemical compound.? ?
??The Institute has already developed a new mixture of the chemical through Nano Technology that can be directly applied to the breast stem cancerous cells. Anticipate the patent license for the product. The results of the research carried out by the team has been published in internationally recognised science magazines. The relevant authorities seem to be still ignorant of the existence of research projects of this nature within the country. A large amount of money is needed for these research works. Our effort are directed towards the benefit of the future generation and our Institute endeavors to introduce our own innovation for clinical use all over the world within the next ten years,? Professor Samarakone of the BMBBI said. ??

Qatar Airways says operations are normal
	
The operations of the Qatar Airways are running as normal with no disruptions to flights with the exception of those to the four countries Qatar Airways has been restricted to fly to, the Qatar Airways spokesperson said today.
The response was made when Daily Mirror asked whether there were any interruptions to the Qatar Airways flights to Sri Lanka in the aftermath of four Middle Eastern countries breaking ties with Qatar.
The Spokesperson said Qatar Airways had arranged for three charter flights departing Jeddah on Tuesday to Muscat in order to assist all Qatar Airways passengers in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.
?Full details of these charter flights are available on Qatar Airways Travel Alert page. All affected passengers in Doha on route to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia have been assisted with alternative onward travel arrangements. At Qatar Airways, our passengers remain our utmost priority and we will continue to ensure they have a seamless journey to their final destinations,? they said.

Rathana Thera says his dreams shattered
	
MP Ven. Athuraliye Rathana Thera today said his dreams to get good and valuable things done from the present government were shattered and he is now left with only one dream, and that is to prevent the government from at least making any harmful decisions.
The Thera expressed these views during a news conference organised by the National Council of Sri Lanka (NCSL) in Colombo over the detrimental conditions of the proposed China-Sri Lanka Free Trade Agreement (CSLFTA).
?As of this moment, my hope is not to get good things done from this government. Those dreams of ours had been shattered. Now our dream is to prevent the government from making detrimental moves. After electing the government into power, we know that not only the Cabinet but we too have a responsibility to prevent detrimental moves from taking place,? he said.
The Thera said he was disappointed that the current trade agreements had been stemmed from the corrupted hearts of individuals and some officials with vested interests.
Quoting a letter issued by the Prime Minister?s Office over the trade agreement, the NCSL said the Cabinet Committee on Economic Management had agreed to phase out and remove the CESS over a period of five years since the implementation of the trade agreement with China.
?Removal of CESS is a major blow to the local industries. This levy was introduced to protect our industries and products from foreign imports. We can?t simple remove it,? the prelate said.
He said a 20-member delegation of the Council met President Sirisena in this regard on Friday and the President had assured not to sign any harmful agreement.
?The President also agreed to immediately respond to our request made to establish a ?National Policy and Planning Commission? to make decisions about the foreign trade agreements. This Commission should consist of two legislatures, one with the representation of political authorities including MPs and another with the input of relevant ministry secretaries, experts in the fields and academics. By a joint Council, we expect to prevent vested and arbitrary actions of individuals,? he said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

Ratnapura was the district that suffered most in the recent disaster. The Diyawanna members of the JO group hailing from the district too had buckled down to relief and rescue operations in dead earnest.
?
?While being in the thick of the relief work, these members had occasion to seek the help of the Blue party purohitas to obtain fresh supplies of essential goods. ?However, due to the poor response received from the Blue party purohitas, they had been compelled to seek help from the Green party counterparts.?
The response they had received from the Green party purohitas had been prompt and positive.?
The Green party purohitas had not only complied with their requests promptly, they had made it a point to check whether the goods or the services asked for were duly delivered. ?The JO members had been so impressed with the ready co-operation received from the Green party purohitas, they had decided they should hereafter have second thoughts before criticizing them in public, they say.?

Rebuke the least expected
	
?
This purohita has been under constant fire from the opposition and the civil society for some time as the villain behind the postponement of the long overdue local polls from time to time.?
?
Many in government and the opposition had looked on this purohita as someone close to Number One for he was one of the few dissidents who took the plunge at the fag-end of the previous regime to back the current Number One after severing ties with the former strongman. He might have presumed that Number One considered him as a special pal given the days of political uncertainty they shared.
By the way, at a recent meeting of the Blue party held with Number One in the chair, this purohita had slammed the leading saffron brigade which has started again fanning the flames of racialism. ?He concluded his attack on the brigade with an appeal to Number One to take some deterrent action to ?eliminate this threat to the ethnic harmony? in the country.?
However, the way Number One reacted to his appeal was something he himself would never have expected.?
?Don?t make it a habit to bring every problem in the country to me,? he told the purohita in a stern tone. ?There is an IGP in the country to maintain law and order. There is a Minister responsible for administration of justice in this country. ?There are various other authorities holding positions of responsibility. ?You had better speak to them first. ?Come to me only if there is no positive response from them.? He added in a sterner tone: ?Don?t come to me carrying tales either!?
The purohita who was quite confident and aggressive at the outset looked crestfallen after being rebuked by Number One, they say.?

SL floods seen in before-and-after NASA animated image
	
Before and after images captured from space show the severity of flooding that plagued Sri Lanka in late May after rains that triggered hundreds of mudslides and killed more than 200 people.
The MultiSpectral Instrument (MSI) on the European Space Agency?s Sentinel-2 satellite captured a false-color image of the flood on May 28, according to NASA. An earlier image taken on Jan. 29 by the Operational Land Imager (OLI) on Landsat 8 shows the same area before the waters rose.
The false-color photos combine infrared and visible imagery to enhance the shading, where greens and blues are sharpened to highlight the flood's widespread impact.
Torrential rain fell for more than 48 hours in parts of the country in late May, with the southern city of Matara receiving the brunt of the deluge. More than half a million people have been affected by the flooding. (Weather.com)

Southern Expressway wasn't cause for flooding: PHU
	
If the Southern Expressway (E01) has caused any impact on the environment as claimed by Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka, its responsibility should be taken by the minister himself along with President Maithripala Sirisena and Minister Anura Priyadarshana Yapa who headed the Ministry of Environment respectively when the highway was built, the Pivithuru Hela Urumaya (PHU) charged yesterday.
It said it was the responsibility of the Environment Minister to allow the project to continue after approving the Environmental Impact Assessments (EIA).
?When the project was implemented, the Environment Minister was President Sirisena. Most of the constructions of the highway were carried out from 2007 to 2010 when Minister Ranawaka was the Environment Minister. Minister Yapa was the Environment Minister when the project was completed in 2011,? PHU General Secretary MP Udaya Gammanpila told a news conference.
Therefore, he said the finger which was pointed at them for alleged repercussions of the expressway should be directed at the present government in which all these personnel are a part of.
Categorically rejecting the argument of Minister Ranawaka, the MP said had the expressway acted as a dam and stored water creating floods, the land stretch from the highway towards the coastal areas should not have been severely affected.
?The most flood affected areas are the coastal areas. How is this possible if the expressway acted as a dam and how Ratnapura, Ayagama and Deniyaya flooded as there was no expressway in those areas?,? he said.
He said the answer to floods was not the termination of highways construction but the construction of highways on pillars in the wet zone.
?Though elevated highways cost 20% extra, it won?t cause any floods. Therefore, we request the government to construct the Colombo-Kandy Highway on pillars,? he said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

Sports minister vows to bring law preventing the sale of medals
	
The government intends to introduce a law preventing athletes from auctioning or selling medals which have been won at international events, Sports Minister Dayasiri Jayasekara said today.
He said the government had to bear a big cost for each player or athletic to win a medal at an international level. ?It is unfair to sell their medal for their own needs as the government was also involved in their achievement,? he said.
Speaking of Olympic medalist Susanthika Jayasinghe?s decision to auction her silver medal, won at the 2000 Sydney Olympics, the Minister said that Susanthika does not need to sell her medal and that she could work at the ministry as they were paying her a salary.
?I think Susanthika?s decision to auction the medal was not a sensible decision. There was no need to do so,? he said.
Jayasekara said if athlete wanted to auction her medal the Sport Ministry could have purchased it. ?If a foreigner purchased her medal, it would be a disgrace to the country,? the minister said.
Meanwhile, Susanthika Jayasinghe earlier said her decision to auction the medal was made after the Sports Ministry suspended her salary in April. She suspended the auction soon after as the president had promised to intervene in the matter.? (Darshana Sanjeewa)

Sufficient stocks of Dextran-40 in Govt. hospitals: DGHS
	
There is no shortage of Dextran 40, which is a drug used in the treatment of dengue patients Health Services Director General Health Services (DGHS) Dr. Jayasundara Bandara said yesterday. He said more stocks of this drug were on the way.
He said the allegations made by the Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) that Dextran 40 was not available in government hospitals was false and malicious.
?We suspended the use of this drug imported from India to treat dengue patients because it had produced negative reactions in patients and replaced it with a safer variety imported from Thailand,? Dr. Bandara said.
He said the purchase of the drug was done on a government to government agreement because of the need to replenish the stocks of this drug as soon as possible.
Dr. Bandara said government hospitals had enough quantities of the drug which could be obtained only from Thailand and the Thai Government has promised to provide the drug as and when the need arises. (Sandun A Jayasekera)

Tea Board expects decline in tea output due to floods
	
The Sri Lanka Tea Board (SLTB) today said it is expecting a decline in tea production in the coming months due to the recent floods that affected the tea growing districts of the country.
?At least 26 tea factories were affected by the flood situation. We will expect a downfall in the tea production in the upcoming months. However, this will not considerably affect the world tea industry,? SLTB Director General Anura Siriwardena said. ?
The SLTB estimates the disaster to have caused about Rs.600 million financial losses to the industry. ?
Meanwhile, the Tea Small Holdings Development Authority (TSHDA), an industry association consisting of small-scale tea cultivators, predicted a considerable fall in tea production in the upcoming months as some of the main tea cultivating districts were severely hit by the recent floods.
The deluge is estimated to have destroyed around 10,000 acres of smallholder tea plantation, particularly in the Ratnapura, Kalutara, Matara and Gale Districts.
TSHDA Chairman Wijeratne Dewagedara said his association is currently carrying out a feasibility study to analyse the total loss.
?So far incidents of 850 total losses and 9,789 partial damages have been recorded. We are hoping to conclude the valuation study within the next two weeks. The Plantation Industries Ministry and TSHDA will provide all the support to uphold the tea cultivators,? he said.
The smallholders account for about 75 percent of Sri Lanka?s tea production. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

## Title: To juice  or not to juice?

To juice  or not to juice?
	
?
It?s nothing new that fruits and vegetables should be an ?essential part of everyone?s diet. It is of utmost importance to have a regular intake of ?these as part of one?s diet. However, not everyone enjoys including fruits and vegetables ?in their meals. You may have your preferences and aversions. Some ?people may like to consume an entire fruit while others may prefer to ?juice it. Juicing is also considered a popular form of consumption, ?especially for little kids, when a disliked fruit is involved. The ?question that has been debated back and forth is whether both choices ?are nutritionally equal. ??
Coming to the point, it is quite obvious that eating whole ?fruits and vegetables is nutritionally more beneficial than juicing them. Though fruit juices come off as tasty and ?refreshing, they are not as healthy ?as consuming the whole fruit due to various reasons. Though it is ?of common knowledge that consumption of fruits and veggies is better than ?juicing, the reasons as to why may remain in the dark. To bring this to ?light, we spoke to Dr. Shanthi Gunawardana, Consultant Community ?Physician, Ministry of Health. ??
?When we consider a fruit, there are two nutritious parts-the fruit skin and fruit pulp. Fruit skins consist of nutrients which provide nourishment and maintenance of ?health. ?The whole fruit comprises of skin, pulp and the fleshy parts ?which are all nutritious. Vitamin C, other ?minerals, carbohydrates and minute amounts of protein, chemicals such ?as flavanoids and carotenoids are some nutrients you find in fruits. ?They are important as anti-cancer agents and help in the prevention of ?cancers, a widely prevalent health plague in the world today. The skin ?of fruits contain other pigments which help protect from harmful UV ?rays. Thereby, fruits harness the ability to act as a protective agent ?from various harmful conditions.? ??
?For example, the skins of grapes especially, are known for ?their cancer fighting ability and as protection against UV rays. The ?pulp of fruits contain fibres which also form an important part of a ?balanced diet. When fruits are pressed or squeezed to make juice, some ?of the nutrients, most notably fibres and water soluble vitamins, get ?dissolved and will be lost. Dr. Shanthi commented on this. ?Fruits ?also contain fibres. When fruits are being juiced, fibres are lost ?in the process due to being crushed, squeezed and mixed. In the juicing ?of fruits, not all parts will be used and so the intake of fibre content along with other minerals and nutrients will be reduced. ?Therefore the ultimate result which is the juice would only have a ?small amount of fibre. Fibre proves very useful, especially when it comes ?to maintaining a healthy digestive system, regularizing bowel movements and helping prevent conditions such as constipation.? In the process of ?juice-making, a higher content of sugar in addition to the fructose in ?the natural fruit is also added to enhance taste, which is not very ?beneficial in terms of blood sugar and threatens the maintenance of a healthy blood glucose level in the body. ??
Juicing is not always about fruits. Some vegetables, for ?instance carrots, can be juiced. But when considering vegetables, juicing is actually beneficial to the health and is not always a bad thing. ?It helps absorb all the nutrients from the vegetables and more amounts of them can be had.
Gastronomically, the digestion of minerals ?and vitamins is facilitated. This also enables the addition of a wider variety of vegetables to the ?diet. Promotion of weight loss, boosting of the immune system and ?increments of energy are among the list of benefits obtained through ?juicing. Brain health is also supported positively in the juicing of ?vegetables. ?It is advised to mix fruits and vegetables together when making juices. By providing supplementary vegetables, this makes up for ?the lost nutrients when fruits are juiced.? ??
Juice is occasionally fine because we need a sweet form of hydration every now and then and it indeed proves to be a refreshing ?beverage. However it is advised not to get carried away and to keep in ?mind that eating wholesome fruits and veggies are vital for proper ?growth and development of the body. ?Better to eat fresh fruits and ?vegetables as much as possible but the occasional juice does not do much ?harm. Mixing juices with supplementary vegetables maximizes the health standards of the drink.? ??

Tobacco kills  7 million a year,  wreaks environmental havoc: WHO
	
?
Smoking and other tobacco use kills more than seven million people each year, the World Health Organization said this week, also warning of the dire environmental impact of tobacco production, distribution and waste.
The UN agency said tougher measures were needed to rein in tobacco use, urging countries to ban smoking in the workplace and indoor public spaces, outlaw marketing of tobacco products and hike cigarette prices.
?Tobacco threatens us all,? WHO chief Margaret Chan said in a statement.
?Tobacco exacerbates poverty, reduces economic productivity, contributes to poor household food choices, and pollutes indoor air,? she said.
In a report released ahead of World No Tobacco Day on Wednesday, WHO warned that the annual death toll of seven million people had jumped from four million at the turn of the century, making tobacco the world?s single biggest cause of preventable death.
And the death toll is expected to keep rising, with WHO bracing for more than one billion deaths this century.
?By 2030, more than 80 percent of the deaths will occur in developing countries, which have been increasingly targeted by tobacco companies seeking new markets to circumvent tightening regulation in developed nations.? Tobacco use also brings an economic cost: WHO estimates that it drains more than $1.4 trillion (1.3 trillion euros) from households and governments each year in healthcare expenditures and lost productivity, or nearly two percent of the global gross domestic product.
In addition to the health and economic costs linked to smoking, the WHO report for the first time delved into the environmental impact of everything from tobacco production to the cigarette butts and other waste produced by smokers.
?
Overwhelmingly damaging process
?From start to finish, the tobacco life cycle is an overwhelmingly polluting and damaging process,? WHO Assistant Director-General Oleg Chestnov said in the report.
The report detailed how growing tobacco often requires large quantities of fertilisers and pesticides, and it warned that tobacco farming had become the main cause of deforestation in several countries.
This is largely due to the amount of wood needed for curing tobacco, with WHO estimating that one tree is needed for every 300 cigarettes produced.
WHO also highlighted the pollution generated during the production, transport and distribution of tobacco products.
The report estimates that the industry emits nearly four million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent annually -- the same as around three million transatlantic flights.
And waste from the process contains over 7,000 toxic chemicals that poison the environment, including human carcinogens, WHO said.
Once in the hands of the consumer, tobacco smoke emissions spewed thousands of tonnes of human carcinogens, toxic substances and greenhouse gases into the environment.
Cigarette butts and other tobacco waste make up the largest number of individual pieces of litter in the world, the agency said.
Two thirds of the 15 billion cigarettes sold each day are thrown on to the street or elsewhere in the environment, it said, adding that butts account for up to 40 percent of all items collected in coastal and urban clean-ups.
WHO urged governments to take strong measures to rein in tobacco use.
?One of the least used, but most effective tobacco control measures... is through increasing tobacco tax and prices,? Chestnov said.

UAE warns to jail Qatar sympathizers for 15 years
	
The United Arab Emirates has banned people from publishing expressions of sympathy towards Qatar and will punish offenders with a jail term of up to 15 years, reports said on Wednesday.
The United Arab Emirates, along with several other powerful Arab states, severed diplomatic ties with fellow Gulf state Qatar on Monday over its alleged support for Islamist groups and Iran. Qatar denies the accusations.
President Donald Trump took sides in the deep rift in the Arab world on Tuesday, praising Middle East countries' actions against Qatar, but later spoke by phone with Saudi King Salman and stressed the need for Gulf unity.
'Strict and firm action will be taken against anyone who shows sympathy or any form of bias towards Qatar, or against anyone who objects to the position of the United Arab Emirates, whether it be through the means of social media, or any type of written, visual or verbal form,' Gulf News quoted UAE Attorney-General Hamad Saif al-Shamsi as saying.
On top of a possible jail term, offenders would also be hit with a fine of at least 500,000 dirhams ($136,000, ?105,000), the newspaper said, citing a statement to Arabic-language media.
Mauritania on Wednesday joined Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Yemen, Libya's eastern-based government and the Maldives as the latest nation to cut ties with Qatar.
Since the diplomatic row erupted, slogans against and in support of Qatar have been among the top topics discussed on Twitter in Arabic, which is a hugely popular medium of expression in the Arab world, particularly in Saudi Arabia.
Newspapers and television channels in the region have also been engaged in a war of words over Qatar's role.
As the conflict between Qatar and several Middle Eastern countries intensified, Etihad Airways announced on Wednesday that Qatari nationals will not be allowed to board flights to Dubai or Abu Dhabi because the United Arab Emirates has banned them from passing through its airports.
Foreigners living in Qatar with residence visas will no longer be eligible for visas on arrival into the United Arab Emirates, a spokesman for Etihad Airways added.
The United Arab Emirates had already said Qatari nationals would not be allowed to enter the country or cross its points of entry, although the practical effects on airline passengers had been unclear until now.
Qatari nationals will now not be allowed to pass through airports in the UAE even to change planes.
'This ruling applies to all airlines flying into the UAE, including Etihad Airways,' the Abu Dhabi-based airline said.
The transit ban on Qataris is stricter than restrictions on Israeli passport holders who are allowed up to 24 hours to change planes at UAE airports, even though Israel and the United Arab Emirates lack diplomatic relations.
Emirates, which has its hub in Dubai, did not respond to a request for comment. Qantas Airways, a codeshare partner of Emirates, said it would not carry Qatari nationals on its flights to Dubai due to the government restrictions.
A Qatari official has said an ultimatum issued by Saudi Arabia and its allies for the emirate's citizens to leave is a violation of human rights that requires UN intervention.
Ali bin Smaikh al-Marri, chairman of Qatar's national human rights committee, said that the Saudi-led move went far beyond a simple diplomatic dispute and would break up families and disrupt young people's education.(Daily Mail)

Water; Lethal or Life preserving?  it all depends on the dose?
	
?
?
The word, ?life? is tightly bonded with the word ?water?. The first life form on earth is believed to have originated from water. A large percentage of all known life forms ?are composed of water. About sixty percent of a healthy adult human male body comprises water; this again is divided into water that is contained inside cells and water outside of the cells, in the fluid portion of the blood called the plasma and in the tissue fluid. Water is ingested into our body through both the food and drinks we consume and exits our body through urination, defecation, sweating and through the breath we exhale, in the form of moisture. In order for the body to function properly, the intake and the output of water in the body should be balanced, because so many functions in our body are dependent on water.
?
How much water should a person drink?
The famous saying that a person needs eight glasses of water per day is without scientific basis, because the amount of water that a person requires depends on the amount of water that gets removed from his body. This amount is different from person to person because the quantity of water lost from a person?s body in a day depends on many internal and external factors unique to that person. A person?s age, sex, body weight, his level of activeness, the water content of the food that he consumes, the climate, will all play a part on his daily needs of water. People living in tropical climates like us need relatively more water.?
Inadequate water in the body has many consequences. The most immediate effect is dehydration.
Limiting your water intake for a long time can have consequences like urinary stones, constipation, infections in the urinary tract, muscle cramps and high blood pressure.
?
About dehydration
Dehydration is categorized into mild moderate and severe forms according to it?s level of seriousness. Even though mild and moderate dehydration can usually be reversed with adequate fluid given orally or intravenously, severe or even in some cases, moderate forms, may lead to fatal consequences like fits, brain damage and even death. Dehydration can occur through excess water removal from the body in addition to not drinking enough water. Therefore people who work outdoors for long periods of time resulting in excessive sweating need to drink plenty of water. Patients who have severe vomiting or diarrhea, especially small children and the elderly, need to stay hydrated by taking fluids like Jeewani and rice kanji in addition to water. If oral fluids are not tolerated, it?s important to seek medical help because the patient may need intravenous fluid resuscitation in the form of saline or similar fluids.
?Did you know that one of the leading causes of death in severe burn patients is dehydration? Burning causes the upper layers of the skin, which works as a barrier that prevents body water from escaping into ?the environment to be lost, causing severe water loss leading to shock and sometimes death.?
?
Too much water?
?But is there such a thing as ?Drinking too much water?? It turns out that there is. It is called water intoxication. This is caused by drinking too much water in a too little time. Our body contains various ions dissolved in the body fluids. The ion levels in the blood, especially the sodium and potassium ion levels, is heavily controlled by the body?s regulatory system. When there is too much water in the system, this causes the sodium in the blood to be diluted, causing the condition called ?Hyponatremia?. Symptoms may include vomiting, headache, lethargy and convulsions
In addition, in patients who have certain conditions like heart failure and kidney failure, drinking too much water could overload the system, resulting in fatal consequences. In conditions like dengue fever too, the water intake of patients should be limited because it may later cause volume overload.
?
Drinking water in the morning
Even though not much research has been carried out in western medicine on the benefits of drinking water on an empty stomach, drinking a glass of warm water is recommended in many forms of eastern medicine, including Ayurveda. It is said to help digestion and improve circulation.
