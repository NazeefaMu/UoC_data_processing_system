Counter-terrorism law to replace PTA: Ranil
	
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said the first draft of the counter-terrorism law which would be placed in the Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA), would be available for discussion by next week, New Zealand media reported.
"I think by next week the first draft of the counter-terrorism law, which will be placed in the Prevention of Terrorism Act, will be available for discussion," he said.
He said the Sri Lankan government was going through most of the things it had promised to achieve, including setting up a missing persons office.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe hopes by next March all these things will be behind Sri Lanka. He said it's a quite open society these days, where fear is no longer a factor.
He said the country was cleaning up its act when it comes to human rights abuses.
He and Prime Minister John Key had formal talks at Government House in Auckland today.
Amnesty International had pressured Key to discuss human rights with Wickremesinghe during the talks, pointing out that Sir Lankan security forces have been implicated in tens of thousands of disappearances.
Executive director of Amnesty New Zealand Grant Bayldon said he wants Key to push for Sri Lanka to repeal its Prevention of Terrorism Act which "is basically a license to abduct and torture people."
"It also needs a law to make disappearances illegal, and it needs to work much harder to investigate those disappearances," Bayldon said.

HPC to scrutinise eligibility of 54 Heads of Govt. Institutions
	
The Parliament High Posts Committee (HPC) will scrutinise the eligibility of 54 officials appointed as Heads of Government Institutions, sources said yesterday.
They said Peoples Bank Chairman Hemasiri Fernando and Bank of Ceylon Chairman Ronland Perera were among the 54 heads of State Institutions.
Mr. Fernando and Mr. Perera were appointed to their posts in 2015. There have been issues pertaining to some of these 54 appointees.
Parliament sources said this was the highest number of appointments which the Committee was examining in recent times.
In keeping with Standing Orders the committee examines officers of the rank of ambassadors, secretaries to ministries, heads of government corporations and other enterprises, advisers and consultants to ministries.
When a person is selected for such a post the Parliament Secretary General is informed of such an appointment so that steps may be taken to have the appointment scrutinized by the High Posts Committee. He then requests the person so nominated or appointed to furnish certain information about him or herself to the Committee. Subsequently the public are informed of the appointment through the print media so that a person who wishes to make representations may do so. The committee takes all these facts into consideration before making its report about such appointments. (Yohan Perera)

NZ and Sri Lanka beef up diplomatic ties
	
New Zealand and Sri Lanka will establish high commissions in each other's countries, the Prime Minister John Key says.
Mr. Key was speaking at a joint news conference with his Sri Lankan counterpart, Ranil Wickremesinghe, in Auckland this morning.
Mr. Key said Mr. Wickremsinghe's visit to New Zealand - the first by a Sri Lankan leader - followed his own trip to Sri Lanka in February and showed each government's commitment to strengthening the relationship.
"Sri Lanka has embarked on a courageous course to rebuild the country after a generation-long civil war, and we are keen to support that process both politically and by growing our strong economic relationship.
"Establishing high commissions in Wellington and Colombo in the next few years will help support that process."
Mr. Key said the two Commonwealth countries discussed reducing trade tariffs, working together on boosting tourism and bringing more students to study in New Zealand.
They also talked about MMP, as Sri Lanka is considering introducing a proportional representation system.
The Sri Lankan prime minister says his country is considering introducing the MMP system for its own parliament.
Mr. Wickremesinghe, who is making the first visit by a Sri Lankan prime minister to New Zealand, said Sri Lanka also wants to study New Zealand's political system.
"The Sri Lankan Parliament is seriously considering taking on the New Zealand mixed member proportional system, which means there'll be more Sri Lankan MPs down here," he said.
Mr. Wickremesinghe was to visit Auckland Zoo this afternoon to see the elephant Anjalee, gifted to New Zealand by his country.
Trade between the two countries is growing, mainly because of rising demand for milk powder in Sri Lanka.
Mr. Key said Sri Lanka was an increasingly attractive market for exporters, and he hopes to boost trade between the two countries.

SAARC Summit postponed indefinitely
	
The SAARC Summit set to be held in Islamabad in November has been postponed indefinitely, the government announced on Friday, after India along with four other member states of the regional grouping decided against attending the meet.
India?s decision was followed by Afghanistan, Bangladesh, and Bhutan. Sri Lanka pulled out of the SAARC Summit on Friday, becoming the fifth country to do so.
The SAARC member states include Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Nepal, the Maldives, Pakistan and Sri Lanka. Sri Lanka on Friday expressed its unwillingness to attend the upcoming SAARC Summit saying that the prevailing environment in the region was not conducive to holding the summit.
In a statement, the Lankan Ministry of Foreign Affairs said the SAARC Charter required that decisions at all levels were taken on the basis of unanimity, and this applied to the convening of meetings of heads of state or government of SAARC member states as well.
?Peace and security are essential elements for the success of meaningful regional cooperation for the benefit of the people of South Asia.?As a founding member of SAARC, committed to regional cooperation, Sri Lanka hopes that the steps required to ensuring our region?s peace and security will be taken to create an environment that is conducive to the pursuit of regional cooperation,? it said.
?Sri Lanka condemns terrorism in all its forms and manifestations, and stresses in this regard, the need to deal with the issue of terrorism in the region in a decisive manner,? the statement said.
Sri Lanka?s unwillingness to attend comes three days after India, Bangladesh, Bhutan and Afghanistan wrote to Nepal, the current Chair of SAARC, that they are pulling out of the SAARC Summit, citing rising terrorism in the region.(The News International)

SL could face power shortage in 2018: PUCSL
	
The Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL) yesterday sounded a warning that unless the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) implemented the approved generation expansion plan on time Sri Lanka would face a power crisis by 2018.
Director General of the PUCSL, Damitha Kumarasinghe stressed that the demand for electricity was on the rise and the PUCSL had warned about a possible power shortage in 2018. ?Therefore, the timely implementation of CEB?s approved generation expansion plan is the key for Sri Lanka to avoid this crisis,? Mr. Kumarasinghe said.
The power plants listed in the Least Cost Long Term Generation Expansion Plan (LCLTGEP) 2015-2034 should be immediately constructed and operated, to prevent a possible power shortage in year 2018 and beyond, he emphasized.
Mr. Kumarasinghe said the PUCSL had requested the CEB to submit the implementation plan including milestones for each of the power plants identified in the plant schedule for the period of 2017-2020 under the recently approved Least Cost Long Term Generation Expansion Plan (LCLTGEP) 2015-2034.
The implementation plan should be submitted to the PUCSL by the CEB Commission on or before October 28, 2016. The Commission had approved the LCLTGEP 2015-2034 on September 15, 2016.
?The demand for the electricity is on the rise and we have warned the government about a possible power shortage in 2018. So timely implementation of the CEB?s approved generation expansion plan is the key for Sri Lanka to sail through this crisis,? Damitha Kumarasinghe, Director General of the PUCSL said.
?There is no other way. The plants listed in the LCLTGEP for the period of 2017 ? 2020, should be constructed immediately and put into operation to prevent a possible power shortage in the future.?
These plants include two thermal power plants with a capacity of 170 MWs in the South, 105 MW gas turbines, a 300 MW natural gas power plant and several renewable energy power plants with a capacity of 655 MW which include three major hydro-power plants. Accordingly approximately 1,230 MWs would be added to the national grid in the next four years, which would help ensure continuity in the supply of power throughout the country, Kumarasinghe added.

Vandalising Buddist Shrine at K'kulam: CJ steps down from Bench
	
Chief Justice K. Sripavan yesterday declined to be a member of the Bench hearing the fundamental rights petition on the vandalisation of a Buddhist Shrine at Kanagarayankulam in Mankulam.
The Bench comprising the Chief Justice, Justices Buwaneka Aluvihara and K.T. Chitrasiri directed the petitioner to re-issue notice on the respondents indicating the date for support on October 24 for granting of leave to proceed.
The petitioner Dharshana Weraduwage had filed a fundamental rights petition seeking a comprehensive strategy to protect and foster the Buddha sasanaya against any future mischief, attack or threats.
It came in the backdrop of the incident of vandalism of the Buddhist shrine room.
Northern Province Chief Minister C.V. Wigneswaran, Law & Order and Southern Development Minister Sagala Ratnayake, Buddha Sasana and Justice Minister Wijedasa Rajapakshe, Northern Province Governor Reginald Cooray and the AG for President Maithripala Sirisena were cited as resposdents.
Deputy Solicitor General Viraj Dayaratne appeared for the Attorney General.
The petitioner said this was not in any way an isolated incident and over the past few months or even before, there have been many constant demands of the removal of Buddhist Temples, Buddha Statues and shrines located especially in the Northern Province.
He is asking Court to rule that no one can be allowed to interfere negatively or act against the affairs of the Buddha Sasana except as provided for by the Constitution.
He is seeking Court to direct the respondents to take immediate action to investigate the incidents reported and to re-build, restore and refurbish all movable and immovable properties of the Buddhist Shrine. (S. Selvanayagam)
