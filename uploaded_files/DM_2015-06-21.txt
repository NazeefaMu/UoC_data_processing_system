Diaspora Festival- JHU considers  restraining order
	
Opposing the scheduled Sri Lankan Diaspora Festival organised by the Foreign Affairs Ministry, the Jathika Hela Urumaya (JHU) today said they would consider obtaining a Court order restraining the festival unless President Maithripala Sirisena reveal his stance on the event.
JHU Media Spokesperson Nishantha Sri Warnasinghe said Minister Samaraweera had not been given the mandate to hold such an event where they expected national reconciliation would be gravely damaged.
He said since the Diaspora Festival was not mentioned in President Maithripala Sirisenas manifesto or in governments 100 Day programme, Minister Samaraweera had acted beyond his mandate that would strengthen those who still have Eelam mindset.
Commenting on the $ 3.2 million offered by the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) for expenses for the Diaspora Festival, Mr. Warnasinghe said there should be hidden conditions and regulations of the UNHRC to give such amount of money.
Who offers such amount of money for free We cannot trust them because they had already taken action to file war crime charges against our country. The Diaspora Festival is very doubtful to the whole country, he charged.
The JHU urged the Government to make known to the public the real objective of holding the Festival without hoodwinking them, while submitting the country to separatism and extremism once again.
He said Sri Lankans are still afraid of even the word Diaspora what was linked with many stories of LTTE terrorists.
It was hard to believe persons and organisations who supplied financial assistance to the LTTE during the time of war, would offer money and other offering for the development of the country, he said.
Therefore, the Diaspora Festival in which persons of Sri Lankan origin from around the world would participate, would be a threat to national security and national unity, he said. (Piyumi Fonseka)

I will resign if Sajith is found guilty-Thalatha
	
Foreign Employment Minister Thalatha Athukorala said she would resign from politics if Housing and Samurdhi Minister Sajith Premadasa is found guilty of misusing the savings of Samurdhi beneficiaries for political purposes.
Addressing a meeting in Ratnapura, she refuted allegations levelled at Mr. Premadasa and stated that those who accused the minister, of giving funds to financially stable individuals, were engaged in a futile attempt to insult him.
Minister Premadasa is a very honest politician. I have never influenced him to do anything for my electoral division (Nivithigala). These allegations are baseless, she said.
If Mr. Premadasa was proven guilty for misusing Samurdhi funds, Ms. Athukorala said she would definitely resign from her ministerial post as well as politics.
The All Island Samurdhi Development and Agricultural Research Production Assistants Officers Union recently alleged that Minister Sajith Premadasa was granting loans from Samurdhi Banks to people who were not Samurdhi recipients by changing the existing circulars. (Piyumi Fonseka)

Jellyfish: Indefinite bans if issue persits
	
The coastal belt in Matara including the 'bathers paradise' Polhena Beach will be banned indefinitely for all local and foreign tourists if the on-going jellyfish issue persists that left five beach users with infected wounds today.
An official at the Disaster Management Centre in Colombo told the Daily Mirror that necessary instructions had been passed on to law enforcement authorities in Matara to warn and inform the public about the danger.
Since Sunday morning there was a noticeable decline of foreign tourists at the Polhena Beach whereas Police Lifesaving members in numbers were present educating the public to refrain from using the beach.
The Matara District governing body led by its District Secretary, Matara Mayor, members of the Disaster Management Centre, Ocean Scientists as well as senior police officials will discuss today to determine whether to ban the beach area indefinitely until the jellyfish threat is over.
At present the police cannot take any action against people who would bathe irrespective of the warning as there is no directive issued prohibiting the use of the beaches.
Four local adults and a teenage boy of a foreign country were admitted to the Matara Hospital on Saturday with infected wounds all over the body claimed to have been received coming into contact with jellyfish.
They were given immediate treatment and their condition was learnt to be out of danger and were discharged shortly after.
The threat had been caused by a type of jellyfish identified as Physalia Physalis that was found in hundreds either in the water or washed ashore.
According to scientists these creatures that roam in far off seas are believed to have been pulled towards the coast by the strong currents generated due to the rough seas due to the monsoonal season.
An unstoppable itch causing infections leading to wounds on the skin is evident if it comes into contact and subsequently symptoms like tightening of muscles, severe pain, increase heart rate and ultimately death for heart patients. (Kurulu Koojana Kariyakarawana and Krishan Jeewaka Jayaruk)

Keheliya backs MR
	
Parliamentarian Keheliya Rambukwella today pledged to support former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, no matter which party he would contest from at the coming general elections.
Speaking at a press conference in Kandy Rambukwella said that unlike other politicians rallying around the former president, he would not deceive Rajapaksa.
I will be with him throughout and we will win this election, he said. 
He also criticized the remarks made by Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne about Rajapaksa.
Rajitha Senaratne is someone who has joined several parties. He would take several supporters of a party and join a new party after creating problems in his party, Rambukwella said. 
Rambukwella also pledged to defeat the Health Minister in his own constituency.
I am ready to contest from the same constituency and defeat Rajitha at the election, he said.(J. A. L Jayasinghe)

National security will be protected-Ruwan
	
The present regime will never do anything which is harmful to the national security, State Minister for Defence Ruwan Wijewardene said today.
Addressing a Youth get together at Temple Trees the State Minister said there is no truth in the statements that are being made by the Opposition that the LTTE is raising its head in the North because of certain actions by the present regime.
UNP led governments too fought the LTTE in the past, even the late President D. B. Wijetunga was able to wipe out the terrorists from the East and we too are capable of stopping them in the event they try to regroup, Mr. Wijewardene said.
He said the present regime will continue with the democratic reforms as it had done during the recent past. We have allowed the judiciary to carry out its work independently and introduced the 19th Amendment, he recalled while stating that the 20th Amendment is the next price of legislation which will bring about political reforms.( Yohan Perera)

I am in Ukraine: Udayanga
	
Former ambassador to Russia, Udayanga Weeratunga who was accused of supplying arms to Ukrainian rebels has denied all the allegations levelled against him by the Sri Lankan government, BBC reported today.
According to the BBC, Mr. Weeratunga in a letter to them had stated that he was now living in Ukraine.
No criminal investigation against me is being carried out by the Ukrainian government as the Ukrainian Internal Affairs Ministry has informed me in a certificate issued on April 1, 2015, Mr. Weeratunga has said.
A spokesman for the Ukrainian Foreign Affairs Ministry had earlier told BBC that it was not possible to prove the allegation or refute them.
Mr. Weeratunga had said that he was currently living in Kiev, the capital of Ukraine; and he had asked whether he would have been allowed to live there if he had committed such an offence.
Speaking about the suspicious death of Noel Ranaweera, a business partner of Mr. Weeratunga, he had said he died in a road accident and therefore no investigation was being carried out over the death.
He had also said all the official documents issued to him by the Ukrainian and Russian governments were with him.
I do not intend to visit Sri Lanka due to this kind of political revenge, he further said.
Mr. Weeratunga is a close relative of former president Mahinda Rajapaksa.
