Four men on trial for trafficking 492 Lankans to Canada
	
Six years after the vessel-MV Sun Sea-with nearly 500 Sri Lankan Tamils aboard arrived off the coast of British Colombia (BC), four men who were charged with human-smuggling saw their trial open Wednesday in BC Supreme Court in Vancouver, Canada.?
According to Vancouver Sun, Lesly Emmanuel, Kunarobinson Christhurajah, Nadarajah Mahendran and Thampeernayagam Rajaratnam have pleaded not guilty to the offence under the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.
In his opening statement, Crown counsel Peter LaPrairie told a 12-member jury that the migrants were charged a fee, generally a $5,000 down payment, to be on the boat, with an additional $25,000 owing when they arrived in Canada, for a total of $30,000.
?A Sri Lankan national who wishes to enter Canada must have a valid passport and a visa issued by the Canadian government to come to Canada,? said LaPrairie. ?None of the 492 persons aboard the MV Sun Sea had the required travel documents.?
LaPrairie said that the migrants will testify that after leaving Sri Lanka they eventually ended up in Bangkok. Some migrants were housed in apartments in Bangkok after arrangements were made by ?agents? they dealt with while awaiting for the journey on the boat, he said.
When it was time to board the MV Sun Sea, the migrants were transported to the south of Thailand, on the coast, and then put on a fishing vessel and taken out to the cargo ship off the coast, said the prosecutor. Some of the migrants spent several months on-board before the vessel set sail for Canada on July 5, 2010, said LaPrairie.
?When the boat set sail for Canada there were 493 persons on-board. One person became ill during the journey and died at sea. His body was buried at sea.?
Emmanuel was the captain of the vessel, spending his time on the bridge operating the boat and staying in the crew?s quarters, said LaPrairie.
Christhurajah was among the last group to arrive on the boat, the vessel not leaving until he arrived, said the Crown. ?He stayed in the crew?s quarters. He was a person of influence on the boat.? Christhurajah rented apartments for the migrants in Bangkok and supervised the loading of the migrants into vans for the journey to the south of Thailand, said LaPrairie.
Rajaratnam and Mahendran were acting as agents for the migrants and were not aboard the MV Sun Sea when it was intercepted by Canadian authorities off the BC coast, he said. Both Rajaratnam and Mahendran are Canadian citizens.
The Crown portrayed some bleak living conditions for the migrants, who included 380 men, 63 women and 49 children aboard the vessel.
The vessel, which was intercepted by Canadian authorities on Aug. 12, 2010, was designed to accommodate a maximum of 13 crew and ply coastal waters instead of oceans. The small crew on the MV Sun Sea had cabins, a washroom and a kitchen, but the hundreds of male migrants were forced to stay below deck in the cargo hold of the ship, said LaPrairie.
?There were no beds. The men slept on the floor. Food was sent below decks and the men were only allowed on deck for certain periods of time. The women and children slept under tarps on the deck of the boat.?
LaPrairie urged the jury to use common sense and their everyday experience to assess the evidence and determine the outcome of the case.
The trial is expected to run eight weeks.

India offers solar plant in Trincomalee
	
A month after Sri Lanka decided to scrap a coal power project involving the NTPC, in Trincomalee, India has offered to build a solar power plant in the port town.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi brought up the matter in his recent meeting with President Maithripala Sirisena in Goa, on the sidelines of the BRICS summit, highly-placed Indian government sources said.
In September, Sri Lanka?s Ministry of Power and Energy told the country?s Supreme Court that it had decided to drop the plan to build a coal power plant in Sampur, Trincomalee, due to ?serious environmental concerns?.
The Sri Lankan government said it was instead considering options such as Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG), solar and wind power.
Last month, President Sirisena unveiled Soorya Bala Sangramaya (Battle for Solar Energy), an initiative aimed at adding 220 MW of solar power to the island?s energy grid by 2020. The President said he hoped that the project would add 1,000 MW by 2025.
Following Sri Lanka?s shift towards renewable sources, India has offered to build a solar power plant in Trincomalee.
The 900 MW, Chinese-built power plant in Norocholai, 140 km north of Colombo, helps the island meet its power demands. Following a recent breakdown in the facility, the government had imposed island-wide power cuts for a few days.
The island has a total installed power generation capacity of 4,050 MW. (The Hindu)

Indian Foreign Secretary to visit SL this weekend
	
Indian Foreign Secretary S.Jaishankar is to visit Sri Lanka with a business delegation this weekend, to promote Indian business and investment in the island nation in accordance with the Narendra Modi government?s policy of using diplomacy to promote India?s trade and investment abroad.
An unstated but important aim of the visit, which is to begin on Saturday, is to compete with China, which has a large economic footprint in Sri Lanka and other countries in India?s neighborhood.
The Sirisena-Wickremesinghe government in Sri Lanka has shed its initial reservations about Chinese investments and interests in Sri Lanka, and is going all out to woo Chinese investments in several big ticket infrastructure and industrial projects.
Indian officials however made it clear that Jaishankar will not be discussing the proposed Economic and Technical Cooperation Agreement (ETCA) with Sri Lanka. ETCA, a controversial subject in Sri Lanka, is being negotiated by the Commerce Ministries of India and Sri Lanka and only two meetings have taken place so far.
While the Sri Lankan government wants ETCA to be signed by December 2016, the Indians would like to proceed slower and are looking at May 2017 as the more realistic deadline for the conclusion of talks. ?
Foreign Secretary Jaishankar and his team will interact with top Sri Lankan officials and businessmen over three days on possibilities of collaboration and cooperation in a wide range of fields.
India has offered to construct a 500 MW Liquefied Natural Gas- fuelled power plant at Kerawelapitiya north of Colombo in place of the cancelled coal fired power plant of the same capacity at Sampur in Eastern Lanka. At Sampur, India proposes to set up solar energy plants and is awaiting the Sri Lankan government? nod.
Likewise, India will be building highways linking Jaffna with Mannar; Mannar with Trincomalee via Vavunia; and Vavuniya with Colombo via Kurunegala.

Mihin Lanka should not be disbanded: Arundika
	
Tourism Development Deputy Minister Arundika Fernando said today that he would request President Maithripala Sirisena and the Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe not to shut down Mihin Lanka.
Addressing a media briefing at the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) headquarters yesterday Deputy Minister Fernando said shutting down Mihin Lanka was not a good idea. It is hard to create a brand name like Mihin Lanka in the airline industry and the airline had been operated as a profitable service while serving domestically,? he said.
?People with expertise in airline services should be appointed to the top posts rather than filling them with unsuitable individuals. Because of these decisions the airline sector in the country could face a severe setback,? he claimed.
?There were other investors other than SriLankan Airlines that were keen on buying Mihin Lanka. I think the action which was taken regarding Mihin Lanka is wrong, in my opinion. The decision was taken after an unfavourable report was presented by top officials to the President and the PM,? he claimed.
?Many people in the previous government have to bear the responsibility for dragging SriLankan Airlines down. It became unprofitable only after it was taken back by the government during the time the previous regime was in power. Those who were put to manage the airline ruined the airline. Three Air Buses had been sold and that money was shown as the profits earned by the airline,? the minister pointed out. (Chaturanga Pradeep)

Meanwhile, addressing the gathering, Defence Secretary Karunasena Hettiarachchi said the MoD?s Centre for Research and Development had completed these projects spending Rs. 10 million and Sri Lanka had to bear an expense of Rs. 1600 million if they were imported.
?This is the final result of the dedication of the well-skilled officials in the MoD. This would also be a remark in the future of the defence field. As the MoD, we have full faith in these officials. Fortunately, we don?t have any financial or technical issues during this procedure. We have skilled experts in government universities to support us,? he added.
He appreciated the Government?s aid in this procedure and added that the Government generally allocated 10 per cent of the annual budget to the defence sector.

Deputy Minister Ranjan Ramanayake on Tuesday came out against a minister, who had shielded his ministry officers from being interrogated by the FCID when they were called to give a statement.
Mr. Ramanayake said this minister had told the officers not to go to FCID and that he will take care of the investigation carried out by the FCID.
?This is nothing but providing oxygen for robbing public property,? he said.
?Neither my superior, Minister S B Dissanayake nor me would have stopped our officers from going to the FCID. I would give our ministry officers money to spend for their food and traveling if they were called to give a statement,? the Deputy Minister said.
Further he said the police or any other investigating body has the right to call any one to give a statement under the criminal code and there are no provisions for a minister to stop any one from going.
?I have complained about this minister to the President and to the Prime Minister and they were both of the opinion that any public officer is liable to give statements if the FCID or any other body calls upon them to do so,? he added.
Referring to the resignation of Bribery Chief Dilrukshi Dias Wickramasinghe, the Deputy Minister said she should not have rushed in her resignation. ? She should have been able to take criticism,? he added. (Yohan Perera)

The Chairman of SAITM and its Teaching Hospital in Malabe, Dr. Neville Fernando said that SAITM would no longer be responsible for the 26 human body parts recently confiscated by the CID from the SAITM laboratory during a search operation to locate the missing body parts of murdered ruggerite Wasim Thajudeen.
Addressing a media conference at the Neville Fernando Teaching Hospital today, Dr. Fernando said the CID had dispatched several boxes containing 26 human body parts without applying the coating of SAITM to make it impervious.
He said he had made a statement to the CID last week and informed them about this incident.
?They sling mud at the SAITM saying we are keeping skeletal remains of the late ruggerite Thajudeen. I had requested the IGP and the CID to check the SAITM laboratory. One day, some CID officials came and taken off several boxes containing human body parts securely kept in the museum and were being used for teaching purposes only. They did not get our seal on the surface of the boxes. Since only the CID seal is there, they can put in any skeletal remains in and claim that they were Thajudeen?s and had been kept in the SAITM. We are not responsible for those 26 human body parts,? Dr. Fernando stated.
However, SAITM CEO Dr. Sameera Senarathne speaking to the Daily Mirror just after the media conference, confirmed that 15 boxes full of human bones were given for educational purposes by former SAITM Vice Chancellor Professor Ananda Samarasekara when he was serving as the former Colombo Chief JMO following a a request made by the SAITM .
He also said Professor Samarasekara had informed the Health Ministry regarding the dispatching of human bones. (Piyumi Fonseka)

He said such technical apparatus were available at the Geological Survey and Mines Bureau.
The President said he was not aware if it was done by the CID or the FCID and added that whoever did it, police came to disrepute for doing so.

The SEC Sri Lanka is a member of the aforementioned committee (C8) and undertakes extensive investor education programmes such as TV and radio programmes on the capital market, regular articles in newspapers and seminars and workshops for different stakeholders.?

This new TV series will feature an eminent panel well versed in the securities market, who will discuss various timely issues as well as a range of topics relating to investing in the capital market. The discussions will be conducted in an easy to understand manner, providing important information about benefits and risks of investing in equity, debt and unit trusts as well as the current state of the stock market. The series will also comprise of a live studio audience who will have the opportunity to pose questions to the panel.
Despite Sri Lanka having an average literacy rate of 93.3 percent only 35 percent of Sri Lanka?s adult population are financially literate, according to the Standard & Poor?s Ratings Services Global Financial Literacy Survey. Hence, the SEC anticipates that ?Isura? will be able to impart proper capital market knowledge and awareness across all sections of society and will assist the existing investors, potential investors, undergraduates as well as school children to obtain a sound knowledge on investing in the capital market.
The programme will have a dedicated hotline to enable viewers to ask questions. In addition, each programme will feature a quiz and give viewers the opportunity to win Rs.50,000 by accurately answering a simple question, which will be posed during the programme.?

SL will regain GSP+: PM
	
Sri Lanka will regain the GSP plus facility by early next year without a doubt, as the European Union authorities are ready to grant the facility by about that time, said Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe yesterday.
He told journalists in Brussels that Sri Lanka would get the concessionary facility of GSP plus, as the country had managed to ensure good governance and democracy.
?I have met three main leaders of the European Union and will meet three members of other parties later,? he said.
?The European Commission, which is the executive body of the European Union, would first have to agree to our request. This is headed by Jean-Claude Juncker, and I have already had discussions with him,? he said, adding that many issues had been resolved during the meeting. He said a few more issues remained to be resolved.
He said the Sri Lankan delegation and he had had discussions with the European Council. This, he said, included a one to one meeting between him and its chief Donald Tusk.
?We also need to have discussions with all member states of the European Union separately, and President Maithripala Sirisena, I and the Minister of Foreign Affairs will undertake this task in the near future,? he said.
He said Sri Lanka would secure GSP+ status once the European Commission approves a resolution to grant it; as the other bodies in the European Union would approve it once that is done.
In addition, he said, discussions would be held with Conservative and Reformist parties in January next year, and added that former president Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga would also participate in these talks.

SLC stays firm on player contracts: D-Day for players
	
The Sri Lanka cricketers were given time till this afternoon to accept the terms of their contracts after a fresh issue over payments surfaced earlier this week.
Players led by Angelo Mathews met with cricket officials in order to reach a compromise over current impasse but the SLC had stubbornly maintained their stance with a new deadline given to accept contract terms or risk being dropped from the tour of Zimbabwe.
After employing players on tour contracts since February (their 2015-2016 contracts ended in February), SLC offered them a new performance-based agreement which sees a substantial cut in players? annual contract fees, although they have been offered significant win bonuses and individual performance bonuses.
However, players registered their firm disapproval, demanding a increase instead. In addition they were demanding that SLC pay them, 10 percent share of SLC?s income from global events which was agreed by former cricket administrators in 2014. ?
?We have given them time till tomorrow (October 20) to accept the new terms,? said Ashley de Silva, CEO Sri Lanka Cricket. ?We met them this morning (19) and handed over the contract papers to sign. Hopefully by tomorrow (20) they will sign and return it to us?.
?There are some concerns by some players and we are looking at them,? he added.
Players incur a substantial cut on annual contract fees under the proposed agreements, but De Silva is confident it would not lead to any sort of resistance from the players.
?To be honest at least 90 percent of the players are receiving much more than what they were getting last year. I don?t think there will be any issues,? he added.
SLC distributed contract papers to 17 players last morning, including captain and vice-captain while papers will be issued to 13 more players later.
SLC?s decision to introduce pay-cuts was largely motivated by finding the Board had disbursed Rs. 684.85 million - approximately around 33 percent of Board?s income - among the 16 players in the National Squad during the previous contract year.
The possibility that Sri Lanka will send a second string squad for the two-match Test series against Zimbabwe and a subsequent Tri-Series also involving West Indies is real and growing.(Champika Fernando)

Stressing the need to implement the short term recommendations Izsak- Ndiaye said issues relating to the return of land, political detainees and military powers were short term solutions for the government?s commitment towards reconciliation.
As short-term recommendations in this regard, in which the visiting UN Rapporteur wanted to be implemented as soon as possible are to; begin taking necessary steps towards the establishment of an independent, dedicated minority rights mechanism in charge of coordinating minority issues, with the inclusion of representatives of minority communities.
-Ensure that the imminent constitutional reform includes a strong minority rights regime including a fully empowered independent commission.
-Extend full institutional cooperation to, and strengthen the existing independent intuitions and ensure sufficient human and financial resources are provided for the full implementation of their mandates, including the National Human Rights Commission, the Office for National Unity and Reconciliation and the Secretariat for Coordinating Reconciliation Mechanism.
Among her short term recommendations for Sri Lanka, the Rapporteur stated that even though the Prevention of Terrorism Act has been repealed its replacement needed to conform with international standards.
Regarding political detainees, the Izsak- Ndiaye recommended that all cases connected to security-related detainees be reviewed and the government take measures to either release the detainees who could not be prosecuted or draw up chargers against those whom there was evidence of involvement in serious crimes.
Finally, Izsak- Ndiaye stressed that the continued and gradual release or compensation for land under military control to the civilian population was vital in the reconciliation process.
While the government was commended for taking steps towards inclusive public participation in the decision making process, more needed to be done for the voices of minority communities to be heard.
The public condemnation of religious intolerance, holding perpetrators of hate crimes and violence accountable and considering the establishment of a system of community liaison officers, to be placed in every public institution, with the necessary resources required to fulfill their mandate.
Izsak- Ndiaye further recommended the government step up measures and allocate a sufficient budget to ensure the implementation of language policy and also ensure that any future electoral reform ensures proportional representation for all minority groups on the basis of accurate data collection and disaggregation.
Linguistic rights in the Northern and Eastern Provinces, the freedom of religious belief and identity issues relating to the IDP?s, smaller minority groups such as Bhurgers Malays, Sri Lankan Africans, Veddas and Telengus and issues relating to minority women were some issues touched on by the Rapporteur.
