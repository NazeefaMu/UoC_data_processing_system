K.S. Sivakumaran discusses  Lankan Tamil culture
	
A glance at ?Lankan Thamil ulture? by K.S. Sivakumaran is to be reminded of the huge cultural gap that exists between the Sinhalese and Tamils, despite all attempts at cultural exchange.??
?
In 19 concise articles written to newspapers from the 1980s on, Sivakumaran presents a fascinating mosaic of cultural facts about Lankan Tamil literature, journalism, writers, life in the North and history of the maritime adventurers of Velvetiturai.??
The author is a noted film critic but this writing reveals that he has been studying the Tamil cultural canvas as broadly as possible.??
The first chapter on the Sri Lankan novel in Tamil reveals that almost 400 titles were published up to 2004 and introduces diverse literary personalities such as poet and satirist Sillayoor Selvarajan renowned for his public poetry recitals. As the author puts it: ?May I humbly state that on my suggestion, Yasmine Gunaratne invited him to write in English a note on the early Thamil novels in Sri Lanka for the Part One of Ceylonese Writing published in the now defunct periodical Community by C.R. Hensman.???
Selvarajan and his family acted in the Sinhala film ?Adara Kathawa,? a story about multi-ethnic love. Tissa Abeysekara made a short documentary film in Tamil called ?Kamam? (agriculture), with Selvarajan and his second wife Kamalini in it.??
When reading this book, it?s a pleasure to find how one thing leads to another: ?Selvarajan?s erstwhile companion was another fine short story writer and critic, M.D. Rasadurai? during the late 1950s, both Sillayoor and Kavaloor (the names of their respective villages) worked for the former Shell company. One of the fine editors in English and Sinhala, Lakshman Ratnapala was also working for that company then (I worked with Lakshman in the newsroom of the Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation in the 1970s).?? A second bibliography of Sri Lankan fiction in Tamil was compiled by academic N. Subramanium, who says the author of first-ever Tamil novel ?Asanbae Udaya Kathai? published in 1885) was Siddi Lebbe. Sri Lanka has issued a stamp honouring him.??
Chapter five traces the creation of a Hindu encyclopaedia, initiated by Chelliah Rajadurai when he was minister of Hindu Culture and Tamil Affairs, and followed up by Minister P. P. Devaraj. It was compiled and edited by ?indefatigable Tamil scholar? Prof. P. Poologasinham.??
In Chapter seven, titled ?The State and Thamil Culture,? the author remarks on the sorry state of affairs which prevailed wherever minority cultural activities were concerned. As the author puts it: ?This is partly due to the Sinhala only known staffers at the department who do not seem to understand the good intentions of those at the top who are trying to show at least a semblance of accommodating the ?other.???
?
"A second bibliography of Sri Lankan fiction in Tamil was compiled by academic N. Subramanium, who says the author of first-ever Tamil novel ?Asanbae Udaya Kathai? published in 1885) was Siddi Lebbe. Sri Lanka has issued a stamp honouring him? "
?I have had bitter experience earlier when communicating with the staff even when they have asked me to serve them in some specific assignments. You cannot blame them because they are the product of a climate influenced by sections of the Sinhala media and the textbooks prescribed for children where anything other than Sinhala is treated as alien. This is the reality.???
Speaking of the national Tamil drama festival, he remarks that whereas Tamil businessmen were not keen on sponsoring Tamil arts and literature, ?it is Al Haj Hashim Omar (who is very fluent in Tamil) who liberally spends promoting Tamil writers
?and artistes.???
?Subramania Bharathi? discusses a book of essays on the Indian poet by that name. It says that a line from his poem ?Bharatha Desam? was much misunderstood by our censors. ?Sinhala theevinukor Paalam amaipom? means ?let?s have a bridge to the Sinhaladipa.? This was taken out of context and banned from SLBC broadcasts years ago. The line actually meant a cultural bridge between the two countries.? ?
?Portrait of a Plantation Writer? discusses a book by Saral Nadan about C.V. Velupillai who loved hill country Tamil culture and folklore. He was a bilingual writer (Tamil and English) magazine editor, trade unionist and Member of Parliament, and among the first to spotlight the plight of plantation Tamils.? ?
?
"In 19 concise articles, Sivakumaran presents? a fascinating mosaic of cultural facts about Lankan Tamil literature,? journalism, writers, life in the North and history of the maritime? adventurers of Velvetiturai"
?A Note on Vesak on Thamil? about a publication on Vesak in Tamil by the Ministry of Cultural Affairs says: ?Apart from the Mawatha magazine, K.G. Amaradasa is the only other individual in the Sinhala speaking world to have at least introduced to the Sinhala readers what is happening in the Thamil literary scene. We are not suggesting that by familiarising with Thamil artistic activities alone, the widening gap between the ethnic groups in the country can be filled. But such familiarisation can help to understand?each other.???
?Velvetiturai seafarers sail for the US? is a very interesting chapter on the history of the boatbuilders, sailors and navigators of Velvetiturai. A number of them sailed from there, on a locally-built boat called ?Annapoorani? owned by an American, and reached New York 18 months later. The article mentions a book about VVT seafarers by a Jaffna journalist, and traces their history back some 700 years.??
?Lankan Thamil Culture? is published by S. Godage & Brothers Ltd., and is priced at Rs.350.??

Kakiyan:  A crow?s eye view of the world
	
Capt. Elmo Jayawardena?s latest book ?Kakiyan? is a smashing read. Having flown jumbo jets all his adult life, perhaps it is second nature for Capt. Elmo to have a bird?s eye view of the world. But to weave this into the life of an ubiquitous being such as a crow, is no doubt brilliant.? ?
The book fires the imagination and will certainly make us think twice, whenever we see a crow again. His observations of their behaviour will strike a chord in the psyche of all of us who have grown up with crows. The classic head tilt, their mischievous forays into our kitchens, their tangoing in water pools, their funeral rites and even their baptism with holy crow droppings! All these intermingled with delightful insights and human alter egos, and heroes and villains in the world of crows.??
?
"The book fires the imagination and will certainly make us think twice, whenever we see a?crow again"
Thrown in for good measure are little philosophical aphorisms. Whose philosophy it is, though, no one knows. Disconcerting at times, one is led to believe initially that it makes a case for an egalitarian society which the crows supposedly have. But the book is certainly not a recast of the Orwellian Animal Farm and does not push its case. It nevertheless makes a strong case for animal rights in many of its thrusts and should endear itself to those fighting animal cruelty. In this sense, it strikes a similitude to Chris Noonan?s and George Miller?s box office hit, Babe.??
Also, noteworthy is the book?s attack on pretense in any form. The ?Great Ones? seem to be steeped in this flaw. A theme appropriate to Sri Lankan politics and one wishes it addressed this contemporary issue in more shindig. However, such an adventure could have made the story lose its savour and restrict its reach and readership.? ?
Acceptance and commitment to life, its joys and sorrows, seems to be the underlying thread. Modern psychotherapists would welcome this approach. A simplistic approach to live mindfully as crows do, an uncomplicated life of ups and downs. Whether this is if at all possible is anybody?s guess. This withstanding, Kakiyan is easy and insightful, and a leisurely afternoon read.??

Mahinda to resign tomorrow: Lakshman Yapa
	
?
Former president Mahinda Rajapaksa, who was appointed as prime minister by President Maithripala Sirisena on October 26, has decided to resign from the premiership tomorrow?after making a special statement, UPFA MP Lakshman Yapa Abeywardena said today.
Speaking to Daily Mirror, he said Mr. Rajapaksa had informed the President that he would not want to drag the country into further chaos.
?President can?t appoint a prime minister until January 2019. Therefore, Mr. Rajapaksa is of the opinion that the country could not go forward with this political turmoil and anarchy,? MP Lakshman Yapa said.
?However, Mr. Rajapaksa has asked the President to appoint the Cabinet and even a new Prime Minister at his discretion,? MP Lakshman Yapa added.
He said they would give whatever support to the President if required in the future.
Meanwhile, MP Namal Rajapaksa tweeted that ?To ensure stability of the nation, former president @PresRajapaksa has decided to resign from the premiership today after an address to the nation. The SLPP with Frm President, SLFP & others will now work to form a broader political coalition with President Sirisena,?? (Sheain Fernandopulle)

Malinga named Sri Lanka's ODI, T20I captain
	
Sri Lanka's leadership roulette continues with Lasith Malinga now being appointed as the limited-overs captain, and Niroshan Dickwella as his deputy, for the upcoming ODIs and a lone T20I in New Zealand.
In the aftermath of home series defeats to England - first in Tests and then ODIs - Sri Lanka took the decision to overhaul the limited-overs side, particularly the 50-overs one for the way forward.
The board took a big call in reinstating Angelo Mathews into the side, after dropping him for the England series, citing fitness concerns. The Mathews axing episode got quite ugly, with the all-rounder accusing the board of making him the scapegoat of an abysmal Asia Cup campaign.
Sri Lanka will be without their lead spinner Akila Dananjaya, who is under suspension after being called for illegal bowling action. Upul Tharanga, who played just the first two of the five-match series against England (didn't bat in the first, scored a duck in the second) - has also been left out.
The pair of opener Sadeera Samarawickrama and left-arm spinner Amila Aponso - who played three and four fixtures respectively in the England series - also didn't find a place in the 17-man shortlist. SLC went with Danushka Gunathilaka at the top of the order, while Asela Gunaratne also comes in after having played his last ODI in Bangladesh in January this year. Sri Lanka also recalled leg spinner Seekkuge Prasanna who played the last of his 38 ODIs in October 2017.
Top-order batter Kusal Perera has recovered completely from his quad strain that he sustained in the second ODI against England and missed the remainder of the series. Kusal Mendis, who came in as his replacement and scored a half-century, has managed to hold on to his spot.
ODI and T20I Squad: Lasith Malinga (captain), Niroshan Dickwella, Angelo Mathews, Danushka Gunathilaka, Kusal Perera, Dinesh Chandimal, Asela Gunaratne, Kusal Mendis, Dhananjaya de Silva, Thisara Perera, Dasun Shanaka, Lakshan Sandakan, Seekkuge Prasanna, Dushmantha Chameera, Kasun Rajitha, Nuwan Pradeep, Lahiru Kumara

Need an election, but not by hook or by crook
	
It is prudent to have a fresh Parliamentary composition through a mid-term General Election
?
Parliamentarian Namal Rajapaksa, the son of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, has exclaimed in his twitter feed as to why those who make a fuss on democracy were scared of elections. Not only has him, rather this has become a common question posed by the Mahinda Rajapaksa loyalists these days.
In a way, this is an ironic question on their part. They were overjoyed when their leader was appointed Prime Minister on October 26 by President Maithripala Sirisena, in the wake of the withdrawal by the UPFA some MPs from the Government.
They did not call for an election then. They were further overjoyed when the same President dissolved their leader?s Government after two weeks when the latter failed to muster (buy over) Parliamentary majority. Then they wanted an election. They have taken two stances on the elections in two identical situations.
Namal Rajapaksa would not have raised this question had his father bought over MPs sufficient to show the majority power in Parliament after he was appointed Prime Minister in October.
?
"A General Election is not an assurance that the SLPP would win since the majority of voters had voted against the SLPP at LG Polls, despite them winning majority of councils"
Nor would he or any other loyalist of the former President have preferred a general election then. They would then have definitely opposed any suggestion to hold a premature Parliamentary Elections. Also, they would then have preferred to run the country until July 2020 when the term of the current Parliament elapses, during which time they would be able to reverse the legal actions that had already been initiated against some of them.
With his, Tweet Namal seems to argue that elections were the best indication of democracy or they were synonymous with democracy. According to this contention, the more you would have elections, the more would the country be democratic.
One can even contend on this line of thinking that democracy would flourish if you have General Elections once in every three months! One should not forget that Adolf Hitler also came to power through an election. Elections are needed for democracy but are not always sacred.
Rajapaksa loyalists have been campaigning for a General Elections since their sweeping victory at the February 10 Local Government Elections.
Yet, they did not want to go for an election when the Ranil Wickremesinghe government practically collapsed in the evening of October 26, and when President Sirisena sacked Wickremesinghe from the Premiership, a few hours later. Then again they wanted an election when it was clear that they failed in their unethical effort to buy over MPs from other parties.
?
"Rajapaksa loyalists prefer a general election for two reasons"
However, their allegation that the United National Party (UNP) is scared to face a Parliamentary Election was not unfounded. A General Election seems to be anathema to the UNP after the February Local Government Elections. UNP prefers a Presidential Election.
Likewise, the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) group in Parliament led by Mahinda Rajapaksa abhors any election in Parliament. They raised hell in the House last month and even attempted to throw water mixed with chilli powder at the Speaker when it was clear that a vote was to be taken in the House.
They, under various pretexts, have been boycotting Parliament for fear of voting in the House. In their view, the synonymy between elections and democracy does not apply to the Parliament.
?
"Rajapaksa faction has taken two stances on the elections in two identical situations"
Rajapaksa loyalists prefer a general election for two reasons. Firstly, they seem to be confident of their victory in a Parliamentary election given their victory in more than 230 out of 340 local councils in February. And in an event they form the Government, Rajapaksa would be able to (And will attempt to) muster two-thirds of majority in Parliament by unethically buying over MPs from other political parties to bring in the provisions of the 18th Amendment to the Constitution again, so that he can contest future Presidential elections.
Secondly, they shy away from a Presidential election before a General Election owing to the Gota factor, which might rob Mahinda Rajapaksa?s chances to make a comeback as President.
?
"One should not forget that even Adolf Hitler came to power through an election"
However, General Election are not an assurance that the SLPP would win an absolute majority in Parliament since the majority of voters had voted against the SLPP at the February LG Polls, despite them having won a majority of councils.
Hence, there is a danger of a hung Parliament being elected again, though President Sirisena?s Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) have patched up with SLPP recently.
It is owing to this very fact that majority voters had been against the SLPP in February that the UNP is demanding a Presidential election first. Yet, now that political alignments that prevailed in February have drastically changed with SLFP/UPFA which had bagged 1.5 votes at the LG elections aligning with the SLPP, the UNP cannot be so confident of a victory at a Presidential election either.
UNP?s only consolation is the SLPP not having been able to address the minority communities, Tamils, Muslims and the Christians.
With some of the men around the former President having racism in their very genes and being unable to open their mouths without disparaging any minority community, it would take time for the SLPP to win over the minorities.
For instance, we can cite an incident that happened recently during the voting on the motion to suspend funds allocated to the Prime Minister and Ministers.
When Tamil National Alliance (TNA) Spokesman M.A. Sumantiran protested against UNP MP Lakshman Kiriella?s call for a vote by name in Parliament after an electronic vote on the same purpose was concluded, even some of the learned men among the Rajapaksa?s ranks described the incident as Sumanthiran controlling the UNP. Would they have claimed that Kiriella was controlling the TNA, had the incidents happened in other way around?
?
"Elections are needed for democracy but are not always sacred"
What makes Sumanthiran controlling the UNP an issue while Kiriella controlling the TNA does not? Wasn?t this pure racism? They have forgotten that they were routed out at the Presidential and Parliamentary Elections in 2015 mainly by the minorities and their behaviour now points that they do not want to win over the minorities at least now.
However, in the light of the current political and Constitutional issues, it is prudent to have a fresh Parliamentary composition through a mid-term General Elections. Unless the Supreme Court upheld the President?s November 9 decision to dissolve Parliament, the only way out would be a request by Parliament to the President to dissolve through a resolution passed with a two-thirds of a majority. Yet, the need for an election does not mean one should ignore the law of the land, which is tantamount to end justifying any means.??

## Title: Pain, the dreaded symptom

Pain, the dreaded symptom
	
?
Pain is the most dreaded out of all symptoms. Everybody suffers from pain during many instances in his or her life. Also described as a protective mechanism, which points out some sort of harm happening to your body parts, pain is vital for survival. The problem arises when pain becomes constant and severe. In this article I will describe some solutions that are there to alleviate pain, especially arising from joints, muscles and bones.?
?
The pain mechanism
When a body part is injured or at least is facing a threat of being damaged, certain chemicals are manufactured within the affected area. These are called pain mediators. The chemicals are sensed by the body?s own wiring mechanism; the nerves. Then the sensation is converted into pain signals which travel all the way up along several nerves to reach you rbrain?s pain sensing station. The brain attempts to localise the whereabouts of? the injury and also attempts to rescue the affected organ through a response. As doctors we use this signalling mechanism and the wiring system to alter the pain response. Most of the therapies we suggest are meant to reduce the pain chemicals or reduce the pain signals travelling along the nerves.
?
How does pain arise in arthritis?
First of all I will explain what arthritis is. By definition the word ?arth? means joints and ?itis? is inflammation/swelling. But in the modern medical arena we use the term arthritis to describe virtually any condition associated with a joint.
There are many causes of arthritis and the pain response too is triggered by a variety of reasons. In a condition called osteoarthritis which affects mainly the knees, longstanding damage to the joint is sensed by the nerves and produces a lasting pain response. In an inflammatory/ swollen type of arthritis called rheumatoid arthritis, many pain mediating chemicals are made inside the joint which is sensed again by the nerves, hence causing sharper pain.?
In rheumatology we also come across people who have body aches which are felt all over. They complain of not just a few joints, but painful areas over muscles. Conditions like complex regional pain syndrome and fibromyalgia are some of the causes for generalised body aches. Here the underlying cause for pain is damage to the tiny pain nerves. The destroyed nerve ending signals a pain response which is sensed by the brain.
?
What are the types of pain?
Subtypes of pain can be divided by its duration and nature. Long-term pain is defined by symptoms lasting for 12 weeks or more. Long-term or chronic pain is a disturbing condition and causes immense misery in the sufferer. Long-term pain is also harmful in the sense that it can cause other organs like the heart to overwork. Heart disease is seen in people who have this sort of pain as the natural body response would be an increase in the heart rate and blood pressure.
Short-term or acute pain is usually observed after an injury to a joint, muscle or bone. This pain response settles within a short duration when the body is able to heal on its own. If not we have a variety of methods to settle short-term pain.
?
How to cure pain?
One important step in settling pain symptoms is to correctly diagnose the underlying cause. In joint disease, as there are various reasons for pain, exploring the possible avenues to correct the cause is the best therapy. Therefore appropriate details about the onset, duration and other associated symptoms are of paramount importance. The specialist consultant should always listen to the patient, as the information gathered this way through a friendly chat is extremely useful. Without a sound doctor-patient relationship, treatment might not be possible.
Then comes the examination component, where the painful areas are gently examined to find the damage. The muscles are pressed to reveal tenderness and the joints are moved about to get an idea about the severity. Using fingers the affected joints are felt to determine the degree of swelling, the warmth and pain.
We use a range of treatment modalities to sort out pain. Drugs are very important in managing symptoms and if carefully selected to suit the patient, they do not cause any side effects. I prefer to describe ?painkillers? under two broad categories. These are, medication which do not alter the underlying disease, but modify pain and medication which alters the cause for pain.?
Tablets like paracetamol, codeine-paracetamol combined, tramadol and even morphine are medicine which usually do not correct the underlying cause of pain. Having said that I do not wish to undermine the importance of these tablets as they are very useful to provide relief.
Non steroid anti-inflammatory drugs, steroids and disease modifying drugs are common examples of medication used to correct pain and settle the underlying cause. If selected carefully these tables are extremely useful to the patient in pain.?
As for physical treatments for pain relief, it should be noted that medication alone isn?t the most appropriate way forward in curing the pain symptoms. Certain physical treatment if provided side by side with medication are invaluable in the process of cure. Some of these are special exercises, stretching movements and technological therapies like ultra sound/TENS therapy.
For joint pain, exercises are useful to keep the joint steady and movable. If given with appropriate pain relief they enhance the well-being of the patient. In National Health Service in the United Kingdom, I still recall how an exercise programme was integrated to manage severe arthritis, even among 80 year olds. Exercise helps the body to circulate blood,? promotes coordinated breathing,? keeps the muscles healthy and improves the range of joint movement. For a variety of joint diseases in areas like knee, shoulder, back, neck and hand there are simple yet effective exercises.
Stretching of muscles and joints is also important in settling symptoms. Stretching helps the muscles and joints to function normally. Conditions like sciatica, frozen shoulder, back pain are easily relieved by stretching manoeuvres.
Technological therapies are things like ultra sound, infra-red or TENS. Certain wave forms of energy or electrical impulses are sent to the affected area and in turn these reduce swelling and pain. We select the therapies after considering the underlying cause, medication prescribed and the appropriateness. Unmonitored physical therapy can sometimes result in harm, so it is important that a qualified consultant prescribes and guides the patient along these pathways.

Possibility of a quick end: Ajith Perera
	
Stating that there is a possibility of a quick end to the present political crisis in the country, UNP MP Ajith P. Perera yesterday said his party has had discussions with SLFP and with some in SLPP.
?We have been talking to various political parties,? he said while adding that it would be a welcome move if President Maithripala Sirisena had expressed positive sentiments. He was actually referring to a statement that have been made by MP John Amaratunga that there has been positive response from President when he met him recently.
However, he said the party will have to settle matters in the streets on December 17, 2018, if President does not act positively to resolve the crisis. He said what UNP intends doing on December 17 is a Jana Bala Mehevuma at Galle Face Green. ?We will reveal what we will do in Galle Face on that day,? he said.
UNP MP Harshana Rajakaruna said the GCE Ordinary Level paper of 2016 was presented to courts as an evidence. This social studies paper he said asks a question on the powers which the President has to dissolve Parliament and the correct answer according to the marking scheme was that it could be done only when Parliament completes four and a half years of its term and also if a motion is passed in the House with a two thirds majority, calling for such a move.

Responding to the first signs of Deep Vein Thrombosis
	
?
Ever heard of a medical condition which is caused by a blood clot which lodges inside one of those blood vessels (vein), located deep inside your body and causes one-sided swelling, cramping pain and discomfort on the foot, ankle or calves? Sounds a bit creepy, but yes, there is a condition as such-called Deep Vein Thrombosis.
To shed light on this topic, which is not uncommon and has an incidence of around 1 per 1000 annually in adult populations, we had a discussion with Dr Vindya Wellala, Registrar in Medicine, Teaching Hospital Karapitiya, Galle.
?Often affecting deep veins of the legs, thighs or pelvis, Deep Vein Thrombosis has found to be commonly affecting one?s left leg as a result of the compression of left iliac vein through the right iliac artery? says Dr Wellala. As far as the ?multifactorial? causative phenomenon of this condition is concerned medics will be concerned about the following:
?
nDamage to the inner layer of the blood vessel due to inflammation? trauma.
	nVenous stasis (stagnation of blood flow hindering the normal drift) due to conditions like varicosis, external pressure on the extremities and long-term immobilisation usually during long hours in flights, bed ridden patients?
	Hypercoagulability (increase tendency for blood clotting) resulted from increased platelet adhesion and medical conditions giving rise to increased clotting tendency (thrombophilia) play the major role.
?
People exposed to risk
According to the doctor the risk of DVT is unpredictable- but medics would say that if you are suffering from the conditions mentioned below you are exposed to risk. The conditions:
?
History of DVT - There is a 30- fold risk?
	History of Pulmonary embolism which usually happens when a blood clot formed in your leg due to DVT, travels to your lungs and blocks a blood vessel. This will lead to low oxygen saturation in your blood which can ultimately damage the lung and other organs possibly causing heart failure, in the end.
	Immobilisation (Long surgeries, long-distance flights, trauma)-There is 20-fold increased risk
	Age > 60 years
	Malignancy
	Family history of hypercoagulability?
	Pregnancy (a natural state of hypercoagulability which increases the tendency to form blood clots)
	Usage of hormonal contraceptives, Hormone replacement therapy
	Obesity
	Smoking
How patients present with the condition?
Localised and unilateral swelling, feeling of tightness, discomfort or heaviness in limbs particularly calves
	Warmth, erythema, and possibly livid discoloration (signs of inflammation)
	Progressive? dull pain
	Calf pain on dorsal flexion of the foot
	Distention of surface veins
	Possibly palpable cord
	General symptoms like fever
	Possible signs of? distance spread (pulmonary embolism) such as shortness of breath, chest pain.
At certain circumstances they can be associated with other features which are related to systemic disease such as anti-phospholipid syndrome characterised by recurrent miscarriages, migraine like headache.
Many ask whether the pain is felt only the legs? The doctor?s answer is no. ?Some people can rarely develop DVT in the upper extremity as well and can present with symptoms including,
?
Neck and shoulder pain?
	Pain which radiates down the arm to the forearm
	Swollen arms or hands
	Bluish discoloration of the skin around the affected area
	Weakness in the hand on the affected side
?However, the bad news associated with DVT is that some patients would get diagnosed only when they enter hospital due to Pulmonary Embolism- a medical emergency, occurs as a complication of DVT which takes place when a blood clot from the lower extremity, dislodges and places in a blood vessel carrying blood to the lungs. This is why proper awareness about these medical conditions is extremely important, because having few right facts in your head can save lives before they get complicated with unnecessary trouble-even if you are not a health care professional? highlights Dr. Wellala.
?
The process of getting diagnosed
We can visualise blood vessels via imaging such as compression ultrasonography with Doppler, which? is the test of choice when it comes to DVT. This is a test in which a combination of ultrasonography to visualise the vein and Doppler to assess blood flow abnormalities is used.However, there are other options such as,
Blood investigations such as D dimer which indicate you are harboring a possible blood clot? is a product which results from blood clot. D-Dimer testing (95% sensitivity but less than 50% specificity where normal test results rules out DVT yet elevated D-dimers alone are not proof of DVT as it can elevate in some other conditions as well.
	Venography?
	CT Scan in patients suspecting pulmonary embolism or malignancy
Once confirmed with DVT we need to look in to the cause such as hypercoagulable state, internal malignancy, unusual site blood clot specially when there is no provocation factor such as immobilization.
?
Treatment?
According to Dr. Wellala it is important to seek immediate medical advice once you notice the first signs and symptoms of DVT as it can give rise to life threatening complications, in the event there is a delay.
Initial treatment usually needs inward care and intravenous or subcutaneous medications to prevent further blood clotting. Meanwhile oral medication will be continued such as warfarin which is a blood thinner.?
Lysis of the clot or thrombolytic therapy or removal of the clot by a surgery thrombectomy-used in rare instances in massive proximal DVT. Additionally,
Compression therapy with bandages and stockings
	Inferior Vena Cava Filters- These are indicated in patients who are at a high risk of developing pulmonary embolism, but contraindicated to go for anticoagulation, thrombolysis, and thrombectomy, However, these filters can only prevent? clot dislodge from lower extremity vessels to lungs??
?
?Prevention
Regular exercise-Try your best to move and stretch your legs when you have been sitting for sometime
	Early mobilisation after surgery, pregnancy and post delivery?
	Compression stockings and intermittent compression as indicated by a health care professional during pregnancy post-delivery or when bed ridden sate.
	Avoid certain drugs such as hormonal contraceptives (birth control pills) in patients who are at high risk
?
Additional food for thought
There are two subtypes of Deep Vein Thrombosis. They are:
Phlegmasia cerulea dolens
This is a severe form of phlebo-thrombosis which is characterised by the obstruction of all veins of one extremity with subsequent compression of arterial flow and high mortality. In this case you will present with severe swelling, oedema and pain on your limbs associated with coldness, cyanosis (bluish discoloration on the area) and pulselessness.
Complications: Shock, gangrene, acute renal failure (due to Rhabdomyolysis)
Treatment is usually an emergency surgery which is venous thrombectomy or fasciotomy where amputation is kept as the last resort. However Fibrinolysis can be considered in case the surgery fails.
Paget-Schroetter disease (upper extremity deep vein thrombosis)
This is another form of DVT which is defined as the acute thrombosis of a brachial, axial or subclavian vein. Sometimes called as ?Effort-induced thrombosis?, this can be triggered by an extreme activity of the arms during sports, operation of a jackhammer etc. or can be a complication of Thoracic outlet syndrome and lodging a foreign object in veins (central venous catheter, pacemaker lead)
Treatment is usually anticoagulation or fibrinolysis.
Additionally you can develop massive blood clots in your proximal blood vessels which can compress other blood vessels- causing a lack of blood supply to the limb of the affected side, increasing pressure within the limb compartment and causing muscle damage, kidney and impairment. Though it is very rare , it can be a life threatening condition which needs urgent surgery.

Second Canadian detained in China amid row over Huawei extradition
	
?
A? ?second Canadian has been detained in China on charges of ?suspected involvement in activities that jeopardize China?s national security,? increasing fears that Beijing is taking hostages in retaliation for the arrest in Vancouver of a top Chinese business executive.??
Chinese media, citing local security officials, reported that both Michael Kovrig, an analyst for the International Crisis Group, and Michael Spavor, who runs cultural exchanges with North Korea, were detained on Monday.??
Both men worked for non governmental organizations and appear to have been picked up for violating China?s strict new rules aimed at controlling the work that foreign NGOs do in China.??
Canada?s foreign minister declined to draw a line between the men?s detention and the court battle going on over whether to grant bail to Meng Wanzhou, the chief financial officer at Huawei Technologies who was arrested for extradition to the United States.??
But analysts say that it is becoming increasingly apparent that these are acts of reprisal. In a video published Thursday, Hu Xijin, editor of the nationalist Global Times newspaper, warned in English that China?s revenge against Canada ?will be far worse than detaining a Canadian.???
Chrystia Freeland, Canada?s foreign minister, said that ?Canada is deeply concerned? and had raised the cases directly with Chinese officials.? ??

SriLankan Airlines Commission: Mihin had never followed a manual when appointing GSAs
	
Mihin Lanka had never followed a manual or proper agreement when appointing General Sales Agents (GSA) to the airline, it was told at the Presidential Commission of Inquiry (PCoI) on irregularities at SriLankan Airlines, SriLankan Catering and Mihin Lanka yesterday.
Providing the evidence former Head of Mihin Lanka?s Commercial Division Rohan Perera said that there was no manual for appointing GSAs and there was no effort to create one.
He informed the Commission that all the appointments of GSAs were made by the CEO of the airline and there had been no advertising procedure asking for possible companies for bids or evidence of evaluations of GSAs.
?There was no evaluation, former CEOs Sajin de Vaas Gunawardena and Kapila Chandrasena told us about what to do and we followed their orders. Also, most of the GSAs were underperformed but there was no evaluation of their performance,? he said.
Briefing some examples, he told the Commission, when selecting GSA for Dubai in 2007, the Board paper seeking the particular approval has a different name, Trico Travels and Tours, while the agreement was signed with another company named, Ominga International FZE.
He also noted that Mihin Lanka and Ominga International FZE entered into a five-year agreement on March 01, 2007 but the particular company was registered only one and a half month later (April 12, 2007) after the agreement was signed.
During his testimony, witness also said that usually the GSA is only paid a commission but Ominga International FZE was paid 3% on all tickets and unit of cargo space sold in Dubai which it represents. Witness also said that Mihin Lanka has also used the company money for various other expenses. (Yoshitha Perera)

The President must bow to unanimous Supreme Court verdict
	
MPs shake hands with ousted Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe after parliament voted overwhelmingly on Wednesday, expressing their confidence in him and demanding that he be reinstated as prime minister. AFP.
?
he Supreme Court has spoken, justice has been delivered, and the President?s action of dissolving parliament has been declared illegal, unconstitutional and a violation of the fundamental rights of the petitioners. But whether the crisis has ended is still a major question. We hope the President will bow to the unanimous verdict of the seven-member Supreme Court bench which upheld democracy and constitutional governance.?
This column, a fortnight ago, said that even if the economy suffers and the administration grinds to a halt, justice must prevail and democracy should emerge victorious.? Defending democracy, United National Party Deputy Leader Sajith Premadasa in his speech on Wednesday in Parliament quoted John F. Kennedy as saying, ?Let every nation know, whether it wishes us well or ill, that we shall pay any price, bear any burden, meet any hardship, support any friend, oppose any foe to assure the survival and the success of liberty.?
On the one hand, such a stand, however painful, is justified in the interest of democracy. If a democratic order is upheld, generations to come will not only relish the benefit of democracy to the fullest but also will be saved from constitutional conspiracies by power-hungry populist politicians.
On the other hand, we need to understand there is an urgent need to solve the crisis and prevent the country from sinking deeper into the abyss it has been pushed into by the October 26 event.?
It goes without saying that power politics, at the cost of the people?s wellbeing, is hampering a speedy solution to the problem. The question is how long the people can undergo the suffering brought about by the recklessness of a few self-centred politicians at?a humongous cost to the nation?s economy.?
The problem precipitated by President Maithripala Sirisena?s impulsive and arbitrary decision to remove legitimate Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and appoint, in his place, Mahinda Rajapaksa, in a major blow to democratic traditions, has eroded investor confidence, suspended the inflow of foreign aid, made loans expensive?
and negatively affected the tourism industry.??
The crisis is virtually killing the economy. It is said it will take years to restore investor confidence in Sri Lanka to the pre-October 26 level.? Ours is a country which depends heavily, apart from exports, on the inflow of foreign investment, tourism and remittances from Sri Lankan expat workers to offset the trade deficit and avert a balance of payment crisis.? There is no gainsaying that the crisis has also added a heavy strain on debt servicing. If we do not honour the repayment of debts and our sovereign bond commitments by the due dates next year, we will be further downgraded by international credit rating agencies.? Besides, if the crisis is not solved soon and a budget or a vote on account is not passed before the end of this month, hospitals will run out of medicinal supplies, the law-and-order situation will be crippled as Police will have no money to buy fuel, salaries and pensions will not be paid, and state schools will have no money to buy even chalk. Yet, it appears that the power-hungry politicians show no urgency to solve the crisis.? They do not give a damn about the looming catastrophe arising out of the absence of a legitimate government.? Like Nero, they are playing their fiddles while the people ? most of whom are financially and economics-wise illiterate -- are being?
duped into believing their political rhetoric.??
It is unfortunate that the crisis erupted when the economy was showing signs of taking off and the then government was pushing forward ambitious programmes such as Gamperaliya and Enterprise Sri Lanka to fast-track the economic growth, despite hostile local and international factors, such as sharp rises in the prices of oil and the?US dollar.
According to an article published in the Financial Times (Sri Lanka) on November 20, the Sri Lanka Prosperity Index (SLPI) increased to 0.771 in 2017 from the 0.661 in 2016, mainly due to improvements in the Economy-Business Climate and Socio-Economic Infrastructure sub-indices. In the complex ranking order, Sri Lanka occupies the 67th place -- one place below Kuwait and one place ahead of South Africa. But, for obvious reasons, sections of the mainstream media missed the story, deliberately or otherwise, though the report certainly infuses in Sri Lankans reasons to be optimistic about the future.? The positive story goes against the Sirisena-Rajapaksa camp narration that the President had to intervene and appoint a new Prime Minister because Wickremesinghe was taking the economy on the path to ruin.??
Now that the President?s has been proved wrong by the Supreme Court, he should stop being petty and be a full-fledged democrat to solve the crisis by appointing Wickremesinghe as prime minister, as he proved on Wednesday that he commands the confidence of the majority in parliament. The President must not heap further economic burden on the people who, for three long decades, had suffered the devastating consequences of the separatist war. The President should work out a cohabitation arrangement to run the government amicably till a general election is held sooner than later in terms of the constitution.? Otherwise, it will become obvious that the President is playing a power game, putting self before the country and the people.
?
It?s power politics, stupid
Yes, in the core of the crisis is political power. Parliamentarian Mahinda Rajapaksa, one of the chief protagonists of the crisis, in a recent interview with the Daily Mirror, was frank, when he was asked for comments on charges that he grabbed power through the backdoor while he could have won the next general election with much ease. Rajapaksa said:?
?There is no such thing called capturing power through the backdoor. A political party is not meant to be in the opposition forever. It should try to become the ruling party on the very first occasion made available to it. We vowed to topple the government after two Vesak Poyas. One Vesak Poya is over. We toppled the government before the next Vesak Poya. Our duty is to topple the government if it?
is possible?.?
He is right. Power politics knows no moral principles. It is simply dirty and therefore, one has to be animalistic to survive in politics, which is characterised by eternal alertness, mutual suspicion, perpetual competitions, cold blooded conflicts, skullduggery, backstabbing, intimidation, assassinations and countermoves. In power politics, those who have power will not only protect it at any cost but also enhance it to prevent even the distant rival from coming closer to them to stake a claim for power. Those who do not have power, on the other hand, will continue to undermine the plans of those who are in power and plot to overthrow the government given a half chance.
Yes, if Wickremesinghe had been a ruthless power-centric politician, he would have anticipated the backstabbing the President delivered in the night of the long knives on Friday, October 26, and taken countermeasures to fox?
the President.

UNP has to mull coalition again: Susil
	
The United National Party (UNP) would have to think of forming a coalition Government if it were to form a Government, UPFA MP Susil Premajayantha said.
Addressing a news briefing yesterday, he said that although Ranil Wickremesinghe obtained 117 votes at the Vote on Confidence in Parliament, the UNP had only 103 seats in Parliament, when the TNA votes were deducted.
?If the UNP were to form a Government, it will have to ally with the Tamil National Alliance (TNA). However, the TNA had categorically said that it would not join anybody to form a Coalition Government,? MP Premajayantha said.
?When a coalition Government was formed between the UPFA and the UNP in 2015, then the UNP had 106 seats whereas now it is further reduced to 103. It means that it is questionable as to with whom the UNP is going to form a Government,? he added.
Meanwhile, referring to the statement made by Ranil Wickremesinghe in Parliament in which he said they would further strengthen the powers of the Provincial Councils, MP Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena said the existing powers in those councils were quite adequate.
?The 13th Amendment to the Constitution made the Provincial Councils strong, which has caused enough damage to the country. Hence, there is no necessity to grant more powers to them,? he said. (Sheain Fernandopulle)

Way out Via media
	
It is time therefore for Rajapaksa to accede to this repeated compromise Wickremesinghe is offering
?
It is a lingering crisis on two demands for political power. Ranil Wickremesinghe and his UNP are asking for their Government back with their PM. With ITAK leadership providing in writing the TNA would support the UNF with no political conditions attached,?Wickremesinghe is assured of a majority beyond the required 113 votes in Parliament.
Rajapaksa has his demand too. It is an early Parliamentary Election.
He promised an early election as the major promise of his care-taker Government, when appointed PM on October 26 through a special Gazette.
The Supreme Court that sat over 14 FR Petitions was expected to deliver its decision on Monday and then Tuesday (11) but never came even on Wednesday (12), and is still being speculated while this is being written.
Keeping the SC ruling aside for the moment, politically, could there be a compromise to end this impasse in Parliament?
There is a middle ground if the leaders were keen to compromise.?
A compromise is possible on Wickremesinghe having his Government that he says is legitimate and Rajapaksa having the Parliamentary Election he wants in early 2019.
?
"Court vacations from tomorrow till early January would certainly deter such crazy interventions or drag this chaotic situation to 2019 as well"
Those protesting and sitting for Satyagrahas in Colombo demanding this Parliament to continue with its four years and six-month term, demanding that 70(1) of the Constitution be respected, have been left behind by Wickremesinghe for a Parliamentary Election with his condition of a legitimate government attached.
He said the UNP was not afraid of an election under a legitimate Government if other parties agreed. Thereafter addressing a representation of the business community in Colombo, he explained that political stability for economic growth needs a new Parliament.
Wickremesinghe has moved away from his earlier demand of having his Government back and nothing less.?
MP Champika Ranawaka has also tagged himself with Wickremesinghe echoing the same slogan of an election under a legitimate Government.
The Colombo middle-class democrats are now with slogans that have lost their shelf life.
It is time therefore for Rajapaksa to accede to this repeated compromise Wickremesinghe is offering.?
Rajapaksa should accept he cannot gain a majority in this Parliament and therefore cannot decide on an early election on his own terms. He has half a possibility if the SC rules the gazette dissolving Parliament as valid. As it is still speculation, it is prudent for Rajapaksa to accept Wickremesinghe?s condition in lieu of an election, if an election is what he ultimately wants.?
Even if the SC rules the Gazette dissolving Parliament as valid, it would not clear a smooth path for an early election as expected.
It may leave a controversy over the status quo that should thereafter prevail.?
Should it be that before October 26, the UNP would keep demanding or, will it be that before the November 09 Gazette? Whatever the confusion, it would have to wait till the SC proceeds today (14 December) with the appeal against the CA temporary stay order on the Quo Warranto writ application testing the eligibility of persons holding public office.
Constitution under Article 170 interprets public officers like those employed by the Republic excluding Judicial officers and also elected representatives from President to Parliamentarians including PM, Ministers and Deputy Ministers.
Yet, would the status quo spur another round of FR petitions to the SC?
Court vacations from tomorrow till early January would certainly deter such crazy interventions or drag this chaotic situation to 2019 as well.?
In such uncertainty, it would still be worth a compromise between Wickremesinghe and Rajapaksa. Logistics, no doubt have to be agreed upon. Wickremesinghe should have a resolution in Parliament calling for its dissolution and an election to be held within three months before Rajapaksa gives way for his Government and accepts Wickremesinghe as PM.
?
"Compromise is possible Wickremesinghe having his Government and Rajapaksa having the Parliamentary Election"
If that compromise can be worked out clean without individual egos playing out against each other, then President Sirisena will have to go back on his nonsensical decision and appoint Wickremesinghe as PM.?
An election under Wickremesinghe and a new Parliament elected is expected to establish political stability and economic growth.
Political stability, yes for a short while.
That temporary breather, I wrote in these pages not long ago, was necessary for this country right now.
The economic growth, maybe, but certainly not development.
Development and economic growth don?t go together in an insanely open, free market economy.
It was three decades ago, the World Bank too agreed these free markets cannot even promise a trickledown effect, good enough to keep social stability.
That, in fact, is what would make a new Parliament also unstable before long. Before long, the economy that breeds more and more corruption would not leave a Parliament representing People.
Politicians and political parties have long given up on their responsibility to represent and serve People.
That makes me repeatedly use MP Eran Wickramaratne?s recent statement made in front of an audience a few days after the October 26 Gazette that created this mayhem.
?Who has gained in this crisis?? he asked and answered it himself.
?It is only the politician who has gained. It is unimaginable you know, what monies are offered, to actually buy people over.? He says the evidence is there on social media.
Though evidence is not stories shared and liked in Facebook and in other social media,
MP Wickramaratne?s claim was endorsed by no other than President Sirisena himself. President went on record over a week ago saying, Mahinda Rajapaksa failed to collect the necessary numbers as the price of MPs went too high.
Wickramaratne thus stands literally right.
Yet his bland statement ?This is an indictment on our whole society and on the values we hold? is another way of palming off responsibility.
It is the society and not politicians alone. He nevertheless underlines one single, indisputable truth.
?Politicians will never change the destiny of this country?..? he stresses.
?I have been the advisor to many politicians. And after advising them, one day a politician turned to me and said, ?Eran?, a minister said (obviously a UNP Minister), you have been working with me for two or three years, you haven?t still understood something??don?t you realise that this system works for us,? he told me. And why should we change it?....? It is no indictment on the whole society. It is an indictment on politicians without reservations.
He says the whole society as he believes the People as responsible for electing politicians who would never change the destiny of this country and for electing politicians who will not ?change the system that serves them.
?
"It is prudent for Rajapaksa to accept Wickremesinghe?s condition in lieu of an election"
There is no better proof of it than the advisor-turned-politician Eran Wickramaratne MP, who now argues publicly to continue with this Parliament full of politicians, who would never change the destiny of this country and he is a strong advocate of this system that serves politicians only.
How decent and dignified is that politics? It is proof, there cannot be decent and dignified politicians in this system, however professionally and academically qualified they could be or however religiously pious and culturally refined their upbringing is.
It is a system that is being nurtured by the filthy rich born out of the system itself and thus become half-brothers of politicians who wouldn?t change the system that both thrive upon.
People thus have a role to play. They need to find a way out of this unholy system.
They need to discuss to find an alternative to this ?system? which means this awfully corrupt, incurable open market economy. The crisis is much deeper and more complex than what is said in media briefings and electing a new Parliament for a temporary respite. It is a new intellectual debate that this crisis demands.

You are the creator of stroke
	
?
It is with the instructions of the doctor only that the patients who suffer from high blood pressure, cholesterol and diabetes should obtain and stop taking medicine. If an individual stops taking medicine of his or her own accord, then he or she has to suffer due to such actions during his or her lifetime?
?
It?s very rare that an individual who has not contracted diseases, can be found among people who live in the present world. It is common not only to all living beings including animals that live in this world, but also to trees and plants that are subjected to be afflicted by various kinds of diseases. In this context, contraction of diseases is a law of nature, which man cannot avoid.
In the face of a stroke, it is necessary to take appropriate steps to avoid such situation without treating it as a shock. Stroke can be introduced as one of the main diseases which makes people disabled. It is a disease that is connected with nerves in the brain. Therefore, any body with a brain has a tendency to be afflicted by this disease. However, it can be prevented by following medical advice properly while being vigilant by the person concerned and by paying attention to his or her behaviour.
While working with stroke patients who come to Ward No. 16 of the Sri Lanka National Hospital Stroke Unit and during necessary psychological counseling being done, it was able to identify several harmful factors about the person and those that affect him regarding stroke including the preventive action that can be taken in this regard.
?
There are three main facts among them1. Not accepting proper medical advice and not taking medicine properly.
It is with the instructions of the doctor only that the patients who suffer from high blood pressure, cholesterol and diabetes should obtain and stop taking medicine. If an individual stops taking medicine of his or her own accord, then? he or she has to suffer due to such actions during his or her lifetime.
It is important to use medicine properly when he or she intends going out on a picnic or during other festive occasions where the? individual may participate and is away from home for two or three days.?
On such occasions the patient can become a victim of a stroke unexpectedly due to the fact that he forgets to bring medicine or? use it.
You may forget the fact that your life will be at risk due to restlessness or forgetting to take medicine, prescribed to be used daily.You should remember that the medicine that you use is the wick that kindles the lamp of your life.
?
2. Use of liquor , cigarettes and other narcotics:
It is only on a hospital bed that an individual who plays the role of bread winner and father repents regarding the harm that he had caused to himself despite the fact that he works with the objective of strengthening his family life.
Specially, the breakdown of the families of workers such as masons, manual workers , carpenters, helpers in the building industry as well as those who are engaged in tiresome and manual tasks may take place due to liquor consumption. As a result of this behaviour, the children may lose their father and the wife may lose her husband and this situation results in the breakdown of the family life completely.
Further, due to the use of narcotics by long distance bus drivers and cleaners, scooter taxi drivers, heavy vehicle drivers, the younger generation and males, such people will be afflicted by non-communicable diseases in future due to their long-term use of narcotics. Due to the use of narcotic agents, the younger generation may become victims of strokes; thus affecting their personality development and the development of the country adversely.
When inquired from a dumb person who has contracted a stroke about the number of cigarettes that he used each day, the number of fingers in both hands? were not enough for the reply. This goes to prove the magnitude of the harm that has been caused to the younger generation and the adolescents due to the use of liquor, cigarettes and various narcotic agents.
It is due to the destruction of vital organs that they cannot get an opportunity to think of the reasons for the unhealthy situation in which they are embroiled in.
You are your best friend. Therefore, you should love yourself.
?
3.Mental stress that is caused due to various reasons.
We all have to face experiences filled with repentance, disgust, pain and restless situations mostly in the face of incidents in daily life. The way an individual faces various problems is manifold. One may face such a situation successfully while another stresses out mentally. Arising of problems is unavoidable. Therefore, mental stress cannot be stopped completely. It is the mental stress that is behind the success of an individual; it is a part and parcel of life.. But, it can also destroy the peace of your mind.? Therefore, mental stress cannot be nipped in the bud. However, an individual should be powerful mentally, to face any tough situation successfully.The necessary assistance in this regard should be obtained from suitable persons.
A great pressure is exerted on the physical and mental wellness of individuals who suffer from mental stress. It is evident that mental stress is a leading cause for stroke.
During the discussions that were held with some individuals who received medical treatment for strokes,it was proved that they have lived under stressful situations due to some problems in their life. This mental stress differs from individual to individual and the response given by him or her is also different.
However, you have the ability to avoid stroke by paying attention to your mental health. Your life belongs to you. Enjoy mental wellness as well for the enjoyment of your life. Get the help of a counseling service to obtain the relief of mental stress.Stroke creates a disability during one?s lifetime.
On some occasions, it only affects the activity of the organs.Sometimes, the hands of a dancer will become lifeless. Sometimes, a teacher may suffer from the disabilities in speech; An accountant is liable to lose memory and a driver may become blind. These are some symptoms of stroke.
In conclusion, one example is given to you. A camera man by profession who is married and is 32 years of age, having fathered one four-year-old daughter was hospitalised suddenly. He has made arrangements to develop his family life very successfully by carrying out his professional duties efficiently. He has become a patient suffering from stroke without the knowledge of anybody. However, he was able to save his life and many things belonging to his life as he was hospitalised very quickly and given medical treatment. But, he who took photographs of the world using his camera lost his eyesight. Everything came to an end. However, he did not lose hope of his life, but he was satisfied with the things that were left with him for his survival.(The writer is a Counseling Officer (Ministry of Social Services), Stroke Unit of the Sri Lanka National Hospital, Colombo)

You never really cared. Should we?
	
Robert O. Blake
?
By ?Republicans are a bit stupider, more rigid, more doctrinaire in their laissez-faire capitalism than the democrats, who are cuter, prettier, a bit more corrupt ? until recently... and more willing than the republicans to make small adjustments when the poor, the black, the anti-imperialists get out of hand. But, essentially, there is no difference between the two parties.? (Gore Vidal, ?The State of the Union?)??
The tagline for McLarty Associates reads, ?We know diplomacy.? I asked a friend for a comment the other day, and this is what I got: ?They should change it to ?We buy diplomacy.? ? Given the history of the US meddling through lobbies, think tanks and organisations that supposedly stand for (the business of) human rights, the witticism isn?t unwarranted or uncharitable. So when an ex-ambassador attached to such an organisation lets out his thoughts on the present imbroglio in Sri Lanka in a local newspaper, we need to not just read, but also read into what is written.??
Robert O. Blake is not the US Ambassador to Sri Lanka, though he?s identified as such in his piece, just as Mahinda Rajapaksa is not the prime minister here (as far as the Constitution goes, that is). According to his CV, he now ?advises the US business overseas on behalf of McLarty Associates.? Is this the same McLarty whose chairman once wrote that he had hopes for no less a far-right dictator than Bolsonaro? The same chairman who wrote that while Brazilians were entering a ?new chapter full of fear and uncertainty,? global markets are willing to give the man a ?honeymoon phase?? If so, I struggle to understand what the former ambassador, now at McLarty, means when he talks about promotion of human rights and democracy in our country. Where do Brazil and Bolsonaro figure in that scheme of things???
People known for their antipathy towards the US and what it does in/to the rest of the world will no doubt think uncharitable thoughts of Blake, McLarty, the Clintons (with whom the chairman associated), and Henry Kissinger (a friend of the chairman), along with those other officials from the Clinton and the Obama regimes who write diatribes against the Rajapaksas and China whenever Mahinda Rajapaksa makes a statement or does something, anything. Since I?m not willing to entertain uncharitable thoughts like that, Mr. Blake, I?d like to get some points across.??
Mr. Blake, we were not born yesterday. Our politicians like to thump their chests whenever they talk about our 2500 year history, but such pride is, while symptomatic of chauvinism (in your books, at least), understandable, given how we were forced to flirt against our will with colonialism and how we are still trying to recover from the colonial hangover. It?s also understandable given our suspicions about the Colonial Project that?s being touted in the guise of democracy and human rights and what not (call it what you will) today. You will forgive me for saying that a substantial part of that project is, in the opinion of many people from the underdeveloped world, being spearheaded by the country you are working for.? Mr. Blake, if China is indeed colonising this country, through ports and massive investments and aid that come with strings attached, it is not the first to do so and it will not be the last. Just the other day one of our writers penned a letter to the Chinese Ambassador. This writer, if I may put it bluntly, seems to believe that the Chinese are washing their dirty laundry using us. He claims to be a big fan of Chinese literature and films and believes that this qualifies him to accuse that country of undermining ours with the recent deadlock. He also claims that the likes of him are for democracy and that they want to build a socialist Sri Lanka. I?m not sure how a socialist Sri Lanka would sit in with your government, but for the moment let?s forget that.??
The point is that none of this happened yesterday. So please, indulge us: how is the ?Chinese threat? any bigger than the threats from your part of the world? I can go on talking about unwarranted interventions, invasions, and covert projects your part of the world has sponsored to the detriment of those same human rights and democratic ideals you say you are concerned with. I won?t. Instead I?ll talk about a claim you make at the end of your ?analysis.???
The Democratic Party won back control of the House of Representatives. That it had to cede territory to the republicans in the Senate is grist for another debate altogether. You seem to think, in any case, that this blue wave will bring ?added scrutiny? to Sri Lanka. You believe, and I quote, that the ?promotion of human rights and democracy would be a priority? and that ?Sri Lanka should expect more intensive congressional review of its recent actions, which could impact Sri Lanka?s access to financing from the new IDFC or the MCC.? Of course, the IMF and other international lenders have withdrawn support from the government until it resolves the deadlock (read, ?until it installs Ranil Wickremesinghe as prime minister?), but for the moment let?s forget the threat you?ve highlighted there. Let?s talk about the party and what people in this part of the world think of its commitments.??
Dictatorships and totalitarian states (some of which you oppose, others which your government has propped up, because after all, ?in OUR interests!?) are essentially, as you would know, run by monolithic parties. There are no oppositions and if there are, they are undermined. It?s fashionable to term such societies as One Party States.??
What of the US? What of the distinction between republicans and democrats? Is it as simple as the good guy bad guy fights John Wayne gets through? Is it a distinction at all? Gore Vidal once wrote about this and he made the following observation: ?There is only one party in the United States, the Property Party... and it has two right wings.? There are many reasons to agree with Vidal and many reasons to disagree, but on this point, history bears him out. Notice, by the way, that he didn?t place them on opposite sides; he called them both ?right wings.???
?
	"?Dictatorships and totalitarian states essentially run by monolithic parties?
	
	
	?Democrats, in the popular view of many, espouse liberalism?
	
	
	Problem isn?t with President, but legislature?
	
	
	?We were not born yesterday"
	
?
The democrats, in the popular view of many, espouse liberalism. They stand for rights. They believe in welfare. They want decency everywhere. They aspire for democracy in every part of the world (can we call it ?permanent democracy??). The president in power is a man they oppose, so the narrative they?ve built up is one where they, the heroes, are fighting a crusade against a group of bigots, zealots, sexists, and falsifiers. The narrative that the Trump administration has brought out, in other words, is that your president and his cohorts are not American; that they do not stand for what America stands for. Resistance to Trumpism must, according to this, come from the party you were once affiliated to (and still are, going by the tone of your piece).??
But Mr. Blake, that is not how reality works. Resistance to Trump and advocacy of human rights and promotion of democracy in countries like ours is never one party?s preserve. It certainly isn?t yours.??
That is why it confounds me as to why, in this grand, sweeping narrative, people who went on record claiming that the death of half a million children in Iraq in the 1990s was ?worth it? are put on a pedestal as anti-fascists, or how a former First Lady who originates from one of the most marginalised minorities in your country can describe a president alleged to have callously treated that minority during the aftermath of a powerful hurricane her ?partner in crime.? And in a best-seller, too!??
If these are the people whose party you now claim will add more scrutiny to Sri Lanka and help it stick to its human rights commitments and democratic potential, we are left to wonder, ?Quis custodiet????
Anyway, back to the point: given this truth, this undeniable truth, can we really take your word for it that the democrats coming back to power means more scrutiny and more safeguards in terms of democracy for us? Given its history, is the Democratic Party, which by the way is associated with McLarty Associates, the best bet we have? I will not write here about what you weren?t concerned about in the last few years: the postponement of elections, the swearing in of a prime minister who lacked a majority (I am not talking about Rajapaksa), and the austerity measures that made it difficult for people to live, let alone live for democracy. But I must mention them, because your lack of concern about those issues and your sudden upset over the coming to power of the Rajapaksas make me question your motives.??
One final point. You believe that presidential elections could be called next year. But you see, the problem isn?t with the president. It?s with the legislature. Parliament. This deadlock came about because the men and women we elected didn?t correspond to the seats their parties won and lost at the local government elections last February. If ever there was a democracy deficit here in the first place, that was it.??
And yet, you never said you were concerned. You never wrote missives to the papers outlining your worries. You never urged the government to address the issue. Why???
I think we know the answer to that, Mr. Blake. Let me spell it out for you.??
The truth is, you never really cared.??

Strasbourg, (Daily Mail), 13 December 2018 - Heavily armed police swooped on the Neudorf neighbourhood of Strasbourg on Thursday amid a massive manhunt for Christmas market shooter Cherif Chekatt.??
Police cars blocked a street as officers carrying rifles and dressed in body armour gathered in the neighbourhood where Chekatt was dropped off by a taxi driver following his bloody rampage on Tuesday.??
Chekatt killed three people and wounded 12 during an attack on the city?s Christmas Market before fleeing when he was shot through the shoulder.? ?
One French police official said security forces, including the elite Raid squad, are taking action on Thursday based on a ?supposition only? that Chekkat could be hiding in a nearby building.??
A government spokesman confirmed authorities have been told to capture Chekatt ?dead or alive?, and that the most important thing is that he is found quickly.

Almost all reading this article may, no doubt, have had the occasion to experience the feeling at a new place they had visited that it was strangely familiar and that they had been there previously too.?

You may in your dreams find yourselves in strange places meeting strange people or performing acts that are totally unconnected with your real life. How can you account for such strange dreams?

Clues to previous birth in Vedic Astrology
There are several ways of using an individual?s Natal Chart to determine his past birth described in classical works on Vedic Astrology. According to Maha Rishi Parasara, as explained in Brihat Jataka, the past birth can be determined by the ruler of the decanate (Drekanna) occupied by the Sun or the Moon whichever is more powerful. The formula is as follows:? first determine of the Sun and the Moon, which is stronger.?
?If the lord of the decanate occupied by the stronger planet, is Jupiter, the native in his previous birth lived in a Deva Loka, in a realm of deities.? If the decanate is ruled by Venus or the Moon, the person has come from the World of Manes (Pitru Loka). There are several interpretations about what Pitru Loka is. But it is obvious that this Loka is the world of human beings.? If the decanate belongs to Sun or Mars the native is a comer from Tiriyag Loga or the world of animals. If Saturn or Mercury is the ruler of such a decanate, the person had lived in a Naraka Loka, an infernal realm or what we refer to in common parlance as hell.
?
Status of person in his previous birth
The status of the ruler of such a decanate whether it is exalted, ordinary or debilitated provides the clue to the status of the person in his previous birth; if the decanate lord is exalted, the person had held a high position in his previous birth, if the lord is debilitated, he would have occupied a menial position and the lord is ordinary, the person may have led a mediocre existence in his previous birth.??

Battle-weary May gets warm reception from EU leaders
	
?
Brussels, (Daily Mail), 13 Dec 2018 -??
EU leaders heaped praise on Theresa May today as they scrambled to shore her up in the wake of her narrow escape in a Tory no-confidence vote.??
Counterparts including Angela Merkel and Holland?s Mark Rutte held out an olive branch by speaking of their ?admiration? for the PM as they gathered for a summit in Brussels with Brexit high on the agenda.? ?
In a glimmer of hope for Mrs May, draft conclusions emphasised that the Irish border backstop is an ?insurance policy? and only intended to be ?temporary? if it comes into force.??
But EU leaders signalled a tough line by insisting that the legal text of the Withdrawal Agreement cannot be reopened - despite Mrs May urging concessions that can help her get the package ?over the line?.? ?
As she arrived at the summit, Mrs May publicly conceded for the first time that the Brexit crisis will cut short her stay in Downing Street.Mrs May has acknowledged she must get ?legally binding? concessions from the bloc in the wake of the extraordinary Tory coup attempt yesterday which saw more than a third of her own MPs vote?against her.? ?
But Mrs Merkel today again flatly dismissed the prospect of renegotiating the Withdrawal Agreement, while the Finnish PM warned the best she can hope for is ?political? assurances.? ?
Mrs Merkel said Mrs May?s victory in the confidence vote was ?pleasing?, but repeated that there is no prospect of changing the?
Withdrawal Agreement.

Cheating at the exam hall - EDITORIAL
	
?
he news of three impersonators being arrested for helping candidates to cheat at the ongoing General Certificate of Education Ordinary Level Exam must be taken seriously not only by the education authorities, but also by the candidates? parents.?
Now that the impersonators and two candidates who were represented by two of them have been arrested the law will take its course.?
But these cheating incidents at a national exam must be focused upon from the perspective of the student. If a student who cheats is smart he might get away with it, but what would be the future of such an individual?
To begin with, students must take it into their heads that the O? Level Exam is the most important exam of their lives. This is because it is the first real challenge a student faces in terms of an examination which is compulsory. Talking about exams we all know that the Year Five Scholarship Exam is not compulsory. Students really slog for the O?Level Exam and if a candidate fails after genuinely trying, the individual can really assess where he or?
she stands.?
Failing the O?Level Exam isn?t a life and death matter, even though there have been past incidents where students have taken their lives after being unsuccessful at passing this examination.?
The problem with parents is that they fail to provide options to their offspring who study for this exam. Parents often remind their children about the monies spent on schooling and tuition and this puts the students under pressure. Most parents never consider giving some leverage to a weak student which they can by opting to settle for less with the understanding that the child will be given time to bloom at future exams. As much as a week student struggles due to certain developments in life, there are others in places like prisons and institutes-which cater to those with special needs-who are finding it a challenge to complete this first stage of education where sitting for an exam is mandatory. For the record, the 2018 GCE O?Level Exam saw 13 inmates from prisons in Welikada, Watareka and Magazine Prison and as many as 560 candidates who fall into the category of those with special needs apply as candidates. No one who has an iota of knowledge of what these students are experiencing mentally would demand the best results from them at this exam. As with such candidates, merely passing this exam would be equivalent to winning the world.?
To begin solving this menace of cheating at this Government exam, we must identify the week students and have special study sessions for them. What would come in the way of such programmes are the teachers preferring to focus their attention only on the bright ones.?
It is alright to talk about a second option while working with these students who are a little slow in learning. One of the best news that we have heard this year in the form of a Government initiative is the authorities arranging several vocational training courses in collaboration with the Ministry of Skills Development and Vocational Training. As many as 2057 courses are on offer under 28 professional sectors and participants can work their way up from NVQ Certificate Level to that of a Technology Degree. The Government authorities have specified that the candidates who complete the 2018 GCE O Level Exam are eligible to enroll at these courses.?
There was also some positive news during the Yahapalana regime when the then Minister of Education Akila Viraj Kariyawasam said that arrangements would be made in future to release the results of both the GCE O?Level and A? Level exams earlier than expected. This he said would help students reduce the ?waiting time? after sitting for exams. The former minister said that if results are announced early it would help students obtain their degrees and post graduate degrees before they reach age 25.?
School students must be encouraged to face an exam, not cheat and most importantly hang in their when uncertainty clouds the mind. In a worse case scenario they must be told that it?s ok to fail the exam, but it?s unpardonable to borrow from someone else?s mind at the exam hall!

How to handle Irritable Bowel Syndrome
	
?
Irritable bowel syndrome is a functional disorder which refers to the changes in the functioning of the digestive system. It is also can be described as a gastrointestinal disorder characterised by the presence of the cluster of symptoms and signs in adults or children that include cramping, abdominal pain, increased gas, altered bowel habits, food intolerance and bloating. Health Capsule spoke to Senior Medical Officer Dr. A.C. Janaka Gunawardana? at the? Lady Ridgeway Hospital about how IBS affects people.
?In the past this was also called spastic colon or bowel, mucous colitis, nervous colon or functional bowel disease. IBS is a common disorder that affects the large intestine. Only a small number of people with IBS have severe signs and symptoms. Some people can control their symptoms by managing diet, lifestyle and stress. More severe symptoms can be treated with medications and counseling. IBS doesn?t cause changes in bowel tissue or increase your risk of colorectal cancer.?
Causes of IBS
Abnormal movements of the colon and small intestines.
Food sensitives, possibly caused by poor absorption of sugars or acids in food.Reproductive hormones or neurotransmitters may be off-balance in people with IBS.
	Hypersensitivity to pain from full bowel or gas.Psychological conditions such as anxiety or depression.
	Genetics [though it is thought to be a possible cause of IBS, so far this hereditary link has not been proven.]
	Small Intestine Bacterial Growth [SIBO]
	Gastroenteritis [a viral or bacterial infection of the stomach and intestines.
?
Signs and symptoms?
Though IBS is mostly characterised by the abdominal pain and cramping there are some other signs and symptoms:
Increased gad
	Abdominal swelling or bloating
	Abdominal pain or discomfort Nausea
	Cramping pain after eating?certain food
	Loss of appetite
	Unexplained weight loss
	Mucousy or foamy stool
	Constipation
	Diarrhea
? ? Women with IBS may have more symptoms during their menstrual periods. Also 70% of people experience indigestion though it is not technically a symptom.
Diagnosis and treatment
IBS is diagnosed by excluding other GI disorders that can cause similar symptoms. A complete history and a physical check-up are taken to determine the time of the symptoms. Further the duration of the symptoms must be at least six months and should occur at least three times a month. A doctor may also recommend blood tests, stool tests, x-rays or CT scans.
Though there are no specific tests to be done in IBS, there are two relatively new blood tests that may help diagnosing irritable bowel syndrome.
