Ayurvedic spa, a costly appendix!
	

A certain key Ministry has launched a new venture which has nothing to do with the subjects it is entrusted with. It is an Ayurvedic Spa!.

However, this spa, the brain child of a high political authority, is out of bounds for the employees of the Ministry, they say.
A large number of young girls account for the majority of the employees recruited to work at this spa which is providing a variety of therapeutic treatments including massage services. The monthly pay being paid to the girls employed at the spa is higher than even the salary being paid to the manager of the spa. The wide discrepancy between the pay being paid to girl-workers and other employee categories has already led to much unrest among the workforce of the spa, they say.
However, the political authority is said to be keen on running the spa built at a massive cost, come what may.
The political boss is dead set on operating the spa at any cost despite it being in the red, because the fortunes of his family are closely tied to it. But it is a great crime to waste public funds on this loss making venture, said an informed Ministry source.

## Title: CSE to introduce risk-based capital adequacy requirement for stockbroker firms
## Section: Financial News

CSE to introduce risk-based capital adequacy requirement for stockbroker firms
	
The Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) is in the process of implementing a risk-based capital adequacy requirement to all stockbroker firms which are members/trading members of the CSE and licensed by the Securities and Exchange Commission of Sri Lanka (SEC).
The risk-based capital adequacy requirement would replace the minimum net capital requirement of Rs.35 million, which is currently applicable to stockbroker firms.
The net capital is derived by deducting the items which are not immediately realizable from shareholder funds of the stockbroker firm, as set out in the CSE stockbroker rules.
At present, the minimum net capital requirement is fixed for all stockbroker firms regardless of the risk undertaken by each firm. The current minimum net capital requirement does not provide sufficient weightage to different types of risks that a stockbroker firm would be exposed to, such as the risk exposure arising from trading activities and the operations of the stockbroker firm.
Also, the net capital positions are presently reported by the stockbrokers to the CSE and the SEC only on a monthly basis.
The Principle 30 of the International Organisation of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) Objectives and Principles of Securities Regulations (issued in June 2010), which is considered as the benchmark for securities regulation, states: There should be an initial and ongoing capital and other prudential requirements for market intermediaries that reflect the risks that theintermediaries undertake.
Taking into consideration the aforesaid IOSCO principle and the limitations associated with the current minimum net capital requirement, the CSE has in concurrence with the SEC and the stockbroking industry developed a methodology of risk-based capital adequacy requirement.
The risk-based capital adequacy requirement compares the risks of stockbroker firms, arising from the transactions and operations carried out, with the amount of liquid capital that the stockbroker firm must maintain on an ongoing basis. The methodology would identify the amount of liquid capital that a stockbroker firm should maintain as opposed to various types of risks the stockbroker firm is exposed to.
There are four types of such risk factors that have been identified by the CSE when developing the risk-based capital adequacy requirement, namely, operational risk, counterparty risk, large exposure risk and the position risk. The risk-based capital adequacy requirement is measured in the form of a ratio which would be called the capital adequacyratio (CAR).
The minimum CAR ratio that has been recommended by IOSCO and practiced by most of the developed stock exchanges in the region is 1:2. The CSE, taking into consideration the best practices adopted by these markets and upon an analysis of the trading patterns and the operational capabilities of the stockbroker firms operating in the Sri Lankan market, has also recommended a minimum CAR ratio of 1:2 to be applicable to stockbroker firms.
Taking into consideration the limitations of the reporting requirements of the present net capital requirement, all stockbroker firms will be required to compute and report their respective CAR ratios to the CSE and the SEC on a daily basis. The CSE has obtained the feedback of the SEC and the stockbroker firms when developing the CAR methodology. The board of directors of the CSE approved the CAR methodology and the rules on February 8, 2016 and the said CAR methodology and the proposed rules are pending approval by the SEC. The implementation of CAR would be a significant landmark in the regulation of securities in Sri Lanka, which would enhance the financial and operational capabilities of the stockbroker firms.

Govt.in close ties with China
	
Special Assignment Minister Dr. Sarath Amunugama today said Sri Lanka was maintaining close diplomatic ties with both India and China and that most of the Chinese funded projects were carried out by the government.
Dr. Amunugama said Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe was planning to visit China in April and have discussions with the Chinese President and Prime Minister.
It is wrong to claim that the government has ruined the diplomatic ties with china. We are maintaining close ties with China and India, he said.
Referring to President Maithripala Sirisenas visit to Germany, Dr. Amunugama said it was a crucial visit to the Sri Lankan economy as it would help us to find an international market for local products, which was the best alternative.
Dr. Amunugama said Sri Lanka as a country was not in a position to obtain loans as we had obtained loans to the maximum level.
Today we are not given loans or not in a position to obtain loans. We have reached the maximum level of obtaining loans. We have had to find alternative methods and the best alternative is to obtain better prices for our exports. We were unable to implement that strategy for the last 10 years due to the war and the failure of the governments foreign policy, he said.
Dr. Amunugama said the exporters were deprived of due privileges of the European Council because of the previous governments failed foreign policy.
We lost GSP+ due to the failed foreign policy of the government. It was a huge blow to our fisheries trade and garment industry, he said. (Ajith Siriwardena)

The Joint Opposition today slammed the Government for evicting residents of Henmulla Nawa Niwasa Watte and the Kajima Watte down Ferguson Road, Thotalanga without any prior notice to initiate the Megapolis Western Province Development Project.
Opposition MP Vasudeva Nanayakkara told a media conference that the fate of all those working class in the heart of Colombo City would be the same as the residents of Kajima Watte and Nawa Niwasa Watte with the continuation of the Megapolis Project.
Is this how the Government implementing Inclusive Development While the poor is evicted to the corners of the city, the business community that depends on the poor is brought into the centre of the city. The real motive of Minister Champika Ranawaka can be seen now. Those who used to hit out at our government can see how this government is dealing with the poor, MP Nanayakkara said.
He said it is high time the people stood against the injustice done by the Government.
Speaking at the briefing Professor Tissa Vitharana said if the demolishing of the houses, which were recognised as unauthorised constructions were essential, the Government should have given alternative places to the residents without evicting them.
He urged the Government not to make the Megapolis Project a threat or hindrance to the lives of the people. (Piyumi Fonseka and Darshana Sanjeewa)

Meanwhile, a powerful section of the joint opposition has taken up the stance that no member from the former royal family should be picked for the post of national organizer if the former strongman is elected the party leader.
The member of the deposed royal family eyeing the coveted post in the proposed new party is not a popular figure in the joint opposition. His rival Diyawanna member from the South is not well-liked either.

There was no difference between the political period of late Vijaya Kumaratunga and the present political conditions, former President and Parliamentarian Mahinda Rajapaksa said yesterday.
Addressing the 28th commemoration of the late Vijaya Kumaratunga, which was held at the New Town Hall, he said that in his opinion he could state that these types of arrests were common under the United National Partys (UNP) regime.
He said that unfortunately, even he was connected with these as the present Government not only consisted the UNP but also the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP).
Im so pleased to have such an opportunity to recollect the memories of Vijaya Kumaratunga and give knowledge to the public about his era.
Vijaya was one of my personal friends since the 70s. He had offered me his vehicle once I was unable to go to Matara Magistrates Court as there was no vehicle. That day he accompanied me instead of sending a driver. Such personal memories cannot be erased, he added.

Accordingly, 29 families from the area had been given housing units at the Randiya Uyana housing complex, 159 housing units at Modara Uyana housing complex and 74 housing units at Sirisara Uyana housing complex.
The keys were given to the residents in January 12 in the presence of Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake. They were then noticed to vacate their old dwellings by end January. We cant compare this incident to what happened in the past, because the demolition of the establishments was not arbitrary, Minister Ranawaka told a news conference held at the Ministry.
He said only 35 families, who had been living on rent, were still occupying the Ferguson Transitional Land and they too have been informed in early December to find alternative places.
The Minister went on to state that some residents, who had been given housing units, had rented out them and had come back to the unauthorised dwellings.
The residents keep returning with friends and families to these houses, especially during the weekends. New comers too had come to the area and they keep acquiring a large amount of marsh lands. This is why we had to demolish the unauthorised structures, he said.
He said the residents, who had houses of more than 700 square feet, had been given two housing units of 550 square feet at the new housing complexes.
Most of the residents, who spoke to media, in an emotional manner had been given two housing units, Minister Ranawaka said showing their photographs.
Meanwhile, he warned people not to rent out housing units given to the residents from the housing complexes and said the government would seize them if they were rented out. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

Whats sauce for the goose is not sauce for the gander
	

A certain purohita of the previous regime was appointed by a political lackey of his as a director of an important statutory body that came under his purview.

The appointment given was a palpably illegal one for there was no provision made for the post in question. This worthy possessed no qualifications for a high office either. So it was a case of abusing public funds to pay a big monthly salary and provide perks like a vehicle and free fuel to the holder of public office sans legal validity.  
This illegal appointment which constitutes a financial crime is now being inquired into by a high-powered commission appointed by yahapalanaya. This story so far should come as no surprise to anyone.
Now comes the part of the story that could amaze even the worldly-wise.
The political henchman, whose illegal appointment is now being investigated, has been re-appointed as a director of the same statutory board by yahapalanaya. This worthy who was a favourite of the previous regime had managed to become a favourite of yahapalanaya overnight, they say.
The lucky director hails from a township located over 100 kilometres away from Colombo and he is seldom seen at his desk, say the employees.

Why can't SL make a self criticism ; President
	
Visiting President Maithripala Sirisena paid a visit yesterday to the Foundation Monument for the Murdered Jews in Europe at Cora Berliner Strasse 1 and viewed photographs and paintings that vividly depicted the horrors of WW2.
President Sirisena, who was visibly moved after viewing the pictures taken at concentration camps, at Nazi factories and at Auschwitz, asked journalists why Sri Lanka couldn't look back and make a self-criticism in order to forgive and forget.
The monument that commemorates the murder of more than 6 million Jews by Nazi German Leader Adolf Hitler is a popular tourist attraction in the centre of Berlin. It is visited by thousands of tourists every day, and they go through the literature and photographs that show what kind of terror tactics the SS used to exterminate the Jewish population in Europe in the 1930s and 1940s. One picture shows a fleet of heavy tractors dumping thousands of emaciated, nude corpses of Jews into a huge pit.
Meanwhile, Vocational Training and Skills Development Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe, who is a member of the tour party, told Daily Mirror that President Sirisenas state visit had all the necessary ingredients to make it an extremely successful investment and business promotion tour, as German -- Sri Lankan relations are at their zenith today.
Sri Lanka could use this visit to encourage German investors to make use of the attractive opportunities in Sri Lanka to invest in industries and use Sri Lanka as an export hub -- to export the products to South Asia in general, and to the huge Indian market in particular, he said.
In the educational sphere, Germany could increase the intake of Sri Lankan students seeking higher studies. The German Stiftungs Foundation could strengthen assistance to Sri Lanka in the varied development segments. The GTZ has been conducting new livelihood projects to help low income groups in society. Small and medium enterprises and industrial projects could also be assisted. The German government could look afresh at the links forged over the years to enhance the bilateral relations that have existed for more than 64 years, Mr. Samarasinghe said.
Sri Lanka looks to Germany as a progressive partner. The Germans were not invaders or colonisers; they were intellectuals and financiers. Germany is more relevant today politically for Sri Lanka as Chancellor Angela Merkel heads a grand coalition government comprising the Christian Democratic Party (CDU) and sister parties the Christian Social Union and the Social Democratic Party (SPD). This is similar to Sri Lankas consensual government, Mr. Samarasinghe said. (Sandun A Jayasekera in Germany)

Yoshitha bail revision: Objections on Feb.29
	
The Colombo High Court today considering the bail revision applications filed on behalf of Yoshitha Rajapaksa and three others, noticed the respondents to submit objections on February 29.
The revision application sought bail for the suspects over the inquiry conducted at the Kauwela Magistrate on alleged financial irregularities at the Carlton Sports Network (CSN).
In the Revision Applications, Attorney General, IGP, FCID Director, Prison Commissioner General, ASP Serasinghe and FCID unit 3 OIC IP, R.A.C.C. Ranasinghe were stated as the respondents.
When the revision applications were taken up for consideration, the Counsel Kalinga Indatissa PC and Gamini S. Marapana PC, appearing for the petitioners told the Judge that on January 30 the Kaduwela Magistrate had remanded the suspects violating the section 14(2) of the Bail Act by not refusing the bail application and therefore order of remand was illegal.
The counsel said that the Magistrate did not refuse the bail application, but remanded the suspects saying that he would consider the bail application on February 11. The counsel ascertained that under the 14(2) of the Bail Act, the Court should either reject a bail application or accept it.
Without rejecting the bail application giving an order to remand the suspect till February 11, was an error in legal process, since it is also violating the Section 13(2) of the Sri Lankan Constitution, the counsel said.
The Colombo High Court Judge A.A.R. Heiyanthuduwa replied that he must consider the matter after listening to the other party as well and should provide an opportunity for the Attorney General for his opinion on the matter.
Acceding the request of the counsel, Judge gave an order to keep the recorded reports of the case, from January 29  February 1, at the Colombo High Court custody and said he would consider the interim relief request made by the counsel on the next date. (Shehan Chamika Silva)
