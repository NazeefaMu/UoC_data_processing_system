?Arab Spring? compared to  unsuccessful ?Janabalaya Colombata?
	
?
The street demonstrations in Colombo were organized with Namal Rajapaksa as the main coordinator
Most of them were seen reciting verses and slogans criticizing the President and the Prime Minister
?
The recently concluded ?Janabalaya Colombata? was a damp squib according to most of the political analysts in Sri Lanka as well as abroad. It was compared to the Arab Spring but was not at all anywhere near to this uprising which spread to most of the Arab countries in the world.??
I shall try to describe our ?Janabalaya? which was mainly to harass the general public who were out trying to go for employment as well as other day to day activities.
The school children were also prevented from attending schools and some who had exams also suffered. This movement which was supposed to bring down the legitimately elected government in Sri Lanka considered a ?Five Star? democracy.??
I will try to elaborate what the ?Arab Spring? was and then deal with the local ?Janabalaya? as one of the front line ministers of the government stated that ?Namal Baby son of the former President Mahinda Rajapaksa the main organizer of the mobilization of people got the idea after reading a book on the ?Arab Spring?. I wonder how far this is true looking at the complete failure of the?Janabalaya???
?
THE ARAB SPRING
The Arab Spring identified as a ?Year of Revolution? was triggered off in 2010 when a 26-year-old, Mohamed Bouazizi, was getting ready to sell fruits and vegetables in the rural town of Sidi Bouzid, Tunisia.??
Bouazizi was the breadwinner for his widowed mother and six siblings and did not have a permit to sell the goods. When the police requested for the permit which could not be produced and when asked to hand over the cart Bouazizi refused and the policewoman allegedly slapped him. Angered after being publicly humiliated, Bouazizi set himself on fire in front of a government building. This act triggered protests in Sidi Bouzid and within days the protests spread to other parts of Tunisia and about a month later President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali fled the country.??
The above uprising spread to Egypt when a democracy activist known as ?Face book Girl? Esraa Abdel Fattah, fought for a new Egypt and was also an organizer for the major protest in Tahrir Square on January 25 , 2011. The Government was overthrown in February 2011 and President Hosni Mubarak resigned and faced charges of killing unarmed protesters. Elections were held on November 28, 2011 but the protests still continued in Tahrir Square as the people were not happy with the results.??
The Arab Spring spread to Libya when anti ?government protests began on 15 February 2011 leading to a civil war between opposition forces and Muammar Ghaddafi loyalists.Tripoli was captured and the government overthrown on August 23, 2011 and Ghaddafi was killed by transition forces on October 20, 2011. Arab Spring also spread to Syria, Yemen, Algeria, Iraq, Jordan, Kuwait, Morocco, and Oman.??
It is interesting to quote from Raghida Dergham, a columnist and senior diplomatic correspondent for Al-Hayat, one of the leading dailyPan- Arab newspapers who believed that the activists were hijacked by long established Islamist groups. ?When the youths went to Tahrir Square and other places, they wanted a modernist future.? Dergham says ?Suddenly they were encroached upon by the well organized and well experienced Islamist parties - and they won the day.? I would like the readers to compare this situation to our Janabalaya which was led from the back by the politicians from the opposition - SLPP and JO
?
JANABALAYA COLOMBATA ORGANISED BY SLPP YOUTH AND JO
The above street demonstrations in Colombo were organized by the above parties with Namal Rajapaksa as the main coordinator. Political analysts believe that Mahinda Rajaspaksa,the former president is trying to groom his son to take over the Presidency in a few years and it appears there is friction within the Rajapaksa family as the Rajapaksa siblings are also trying to run for the next Presidency. Basil Rajapaksewho is given credit for the landslide victory that the SLPP gained in February 2018 which was mainly due to his organizing skills and political experience as he was a member of the SLFP as well as the UNP and is well versed with their political strategies. It is also reported that Basil advised the organizers of the Janabalaya to postpone it to December as it would have a direct impact on the Provincial Council elections expected in January 2019. However, Namal was so eager to go ahead and his uncle?s advise was ignored resulting in a complete disaster. Namal and his acolytes were so certain about their street demonstrations and openly said that there would be a new government with MR sworn in as Prime Minister on 6 September 2018.??

The Arab Spring spread to Libya when anti ?government protests began on 15 February 2011
?
The organizer from each electorate was requested to bring at least 5000 people and to entice them they were supposed to be given liquor, a packet of rice and a water bottle. However, there was so much of confusion as to where they were heading as till the last moment the venue was not revealed. People brought in buses gathered at Nugegoda, Maradana and Kolonnawa and were asked to march to the Lake House roundabout. However, the main organizer Namal and the former Ministers who were the leaders in overthrowing the Government were billed at Shangri?la, Hilton and Taj Samudra and were watching the dissipated crowds from their hotel rooms.??
The big wigs like the former President and his brother Gotabhaya as well as the other leaders like the Rhodes Scholar and vociferous speakers like Weerawamsa and Bandula were seen with hailers from open vehicles like ?Jack in the Box?. Even the former President?s security detail could not perform their duties as people were seen clinging to his vehicle.??
A Satyagraha was planned around the Lake House Roundabout till 6.00 a.m., but had to be abandoned as most of the people left the venue around 8.00 p.m. thoroughly disgusted and blaming the organizers. The people who were drunk were seen sleeping around street corners as well as on the main roads.??
?
RECOMMENDATIONS AND CONCLUSIONS
I was amused seeing this protest march where there were various categories of people, some on their fours and some carrying placards without any effective slogans. Most of them were seen reciting verses and slogans criticizing the President and the Prime Minister and some unruly crowds also used bad words. A set of film stars were also seen in the crowd. There were also elderly men and women who had come to Colombo for this protest march. The organizers had no plans for their rest and refreshments. I also saw the mob at a large liquor store with liquor bottles.??
The intelligence reports from the districts as well as those from the Police stated that the crowd around Lake House was under 60,000. I would now ask the organizers where were the 200,000 you promised.? There was also an aerial photo of crowds at Nugegoda but these shots were taken in 2016 for Mahinda Rajapaksa?s meeting after his defeat.??
I also listened to a press conference given by the SLPP and one member who is out on bail for financial crimes, who had the audacity to state that they could have brought all the trains, buses and the international airport to a complete standstill if they wanted. This shows to what low levels that our power crazy politicians can go to grab power at the expense of the poor masses.??
There is no way we can compare our Janabalaya to the Arab Spring as the latter was to drive away dictators. However with the Arab Spring there was the military capturing power especially in Egypt in 2011 and elections in 2014. Abdel Fattah el Sisi was elected President after a period of 3 years of military rule. I hope such a situation will not occur in Sri Lanka.??
In conclusion, I would strongly advise the JO as well as the SLPP to organize meetings at known locations if they want to voice their protests against a legally elected government and also wait for the elections in 2019 and 2020 without harassing the general public.??
?Also do not try to mobilize crowds to make the Crown Prince popular as the candidate for the Presidential election. I also like to quote from the political Editor of a weekly newspaper in an article on September 9, 2018 titled ?Namal: The crown prince in a tearing hurry? he states that ?In Disney?s blockbuster animation Lion King, Mufasa, leader of the pride, shows Simba the kingdom that will one day be his. In the movie, the young cub nearly lost it through willfulness and regret.? I will leave it to the readers to judge how true this story is as applied to the local crown prince.??

CDS could not have gone abroad without President's knowledge: Sumanthiran
	
The Tamil National Alliance (TNA) yesterday struck a note of criticism at President Maithripala Sirisena over the incident in which Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) Ravindra Wijegunaratne left the country for Mexico last Monday despite him being called by the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) to give a statement.
The CDS is accused of aiding Navy officer Chandana Prasad Hettiarachchi who is a suspect in a case involving the abduction of 11 persons during the wartime. He had been summoned by the CID to record a statement last Monday.
Commenting on the incident, TNA MP M.A. Sumanthiran told the Daily Mirror that Wijegunaratne could not have gone abroad without informing the President.
?There have been news reports in the Sinhala media that the President had instructed military high officials not to divulge information to the CID. The CID has been asking for details with regard to the abduction of 11 students and murder in Colombo. The CDS is suspected of having aided Hettiarachchi to escape the country. We are concerned about this,? he said.
?The President knows his involvement. These developments concern us. In these matters, the government assured the international community that the rule of law will prevail,? he said.
He said that this kind of interference confirmed that international involvement was necessary for judicial processes here. Mr. Sumanthiran said he enacted to send a strong message before the President reached the UN to address the annual general assembly. (Kelum Bandara)

China welcomes US trade talks offer
	
?
BEIJING AFP Sept13, 2018-
China said Thursday it welcomes the US offer to hold another round of trade talks, and the two sides are discussing the details as fresh tariffs loom large.
?The Chinese side believes that the escalation of the trade conflict is not in the interest of either party,? commerce ministry spokesman Gao Feng told reporters at a regular news briefing.
Beijing ?has indeed received an invitation from the US and holds a welcoming attitude to it?, said Gao, noting the ?two sides are still communicating on the specific details?.
News that US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin had invited top Chinese officials for talks comes just under a week after US President Donald Trump threatened to impose tariffs on all $500 billion worth of imports from China.
Trump?s first round of tariffs this summer hit $50 billion in Chinese goods including high-end technology parts and manufactured goods, while Beijing fired back dollar-for-dollar at US soybeans, autos and other farm goods.
In Washington, White House economic advisor Larry Kudlow sounded a cautious note about the talks possible outcome.

Does SL really need new Hate  Speech legislation?
	
?
What is hate in one country, may not be in the other. What was hate a few decades ago, may not be today
	?
	Speech is the means through which an individual finds his place in society?
	?
	We should ask ourselves whether it was Facebook that caused the riots in 1915, the 1970s, the 1980s
?
The question of hate speech legislation has been revived in Sri Lanka following recent communal tensions in the country. This represents an understandable reaction by the public to vitriolic rhetoric and violence from extremist segments of society. However, there is already an established range of speech laws in Sri Lanka. The incorporation of the ICCPR into domestic law, the speech provisions of the Constitution and the penal code actually provide quite extensive legislative provisions towards speech. The issue is therefore not one of new legislation, but enforcement of existing ones. Unfortunately, the targeting of hate speech often results in nothing but a pyrrhic victory, whilst ignoring the root causes of many problems. It is open to significant abuse and serves as a useful tool for governments wishing to stifle criticism and distract from the real issues.? ?
It is for this reason that at this juncture where Sri Lanka is contemplating the direction of its policy towards speech laws, it is worthwhile to consider the fundamentals of what hate speech is and why is the freedom of speech such an important concept.? ?
?
What is Hate Speech??
In considering this question, we should first consider what ?speech? is. This is something that goes beyond mere verbal communication. It includes what you write, pictures, videos, music etc. According to US case law (Citizens United vs FEC (2010)), even the spending of money in the context of financing political campaign groups is viewed as a form of speech. Speech could therefore be described as the expression of ideas and viewpoints.? ?
?
What is ?Hate? in terms of Hate Speech??
People often assume this is an obvious answer. They assume hate is just bad people saying bad things. But when you bring the weight of the law into the equation, definitions become incredibly important. Clear definitions are vital to ensure that the law can at least attempt to ensure consistency in its application.
It is arguably impossible to give the word hate a conclusive legal definition. The word is influenced by a wide spectrum of subjective, regional and societal factors. What is hate in one country, may not be in the other. What was hate a few decades ago, may not be today.? ?
If you refer to the dictionary, hate is described as an intense or extremely-strong dislike towards someone or something. It would be absurd to take this literally in a legal sense. It certainly should not be hate speech to say that you hate eating vegetables, or you hate our politicians.? ?
This is because true political and ideological discourse cannot exist without opposing parties attacking each others ideas, often laced with hyperbole and extreme dislike for the other person?s viewpoint.? ?
A quick look at the international treaties shows that the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (ICERD) targets speech that justify or promote racial hatred. The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) prohibits any advocacy of national, racial or religious hatred that constitutes incitement. It is clear that the word hate is used as a tool to denote a certain threshold after which certain types of speech becomes unacceptable.?
The problem with this is that this threshold at which speech becomes hate, is determined by societal conventions. There are serious risks in relying on social norms of morality when restricting speech. Social norms are determined through social arguments which are contested through society. It is the interplay between contrasting ideologies that make up culture itself. They are therefore, constantly in a state of flux, where new social norms are born and old ones fade away through public discourse. It is something ever-evolving and is very difficult to officiate.? ?
Racist views used to be an official and accepted part of European cultural norms. In fact, one of the arguments against Jewish communities in Britain was that they could not assimilate into liberal Western culture due to their Old Testament values. In the past, and even today in certain parts of the world, blasphemous speech such as denying the existence of God would certainly be considered hateful -- and would get you imprisoned, or likely worse. Galileo, had to face the consequences of being convicted of heresy for his heliocentric views that it was actually the earth that revolves around the sun, rather than the other way around.? ?
Social norms are disproportionately shaped by the majority opinion. By deciding through legislation what is culturally acceptable based on popular opinion -- the intuitions of the hegemonic class will become entrenched in the societal system, at the expense of minority voices to the contrary. This ends up contradicting the original intention of protecting minority rights, and often could end up as a chimera for control over society.? ?
I will add here that there should at the very least be a distinction between racist and religious speech. The right to offend is something of great value to society, and the particular nature of religion is that it is entirely ideological in nature. It represents the deeply subjective ideas that people hold and any views to the contrary are inevitably offensive to them. The views of an atheist will inevitably be highly offensive to the majority of religious people, but it would be absurd to deem that hate speech.? ?
Hate Speech legislation is something that should be approached with extreme caution. At the end of the day it is a decision to be taken by society as to what degree of control over speech it is willing to give up in the name of security. History and culture often play a role in attitudes towards this -- and Europe?s more restrictive laws on speech can be explained by its colonial and WW2 past as opposed to the US? more free speech-centred, first amendment approach.? ?
Whilst there may be certain instances where restriction is necessary (such as direct incitement to violence) -- mere offensiveness is a dangerous thing to legislate against. The chilling effect on democratic discourse that Hate Speech laws can have in the wrong hands provide plenty reason to be careful.? ?
?
Why is Free Speech so important?? ?
?
?I disapprove of what you say, but will defend to the death your right to say it?
? Evelyn Beatrice Hall??
?
?Think for yourselves, and allow others the privilege to do so, too??
- Voltaire
?
It?s very easy in modern times to take this fundamental right for granted. People might question why they should defend the free speech of people who express views that they find so odious.? ?
Speech is the means through which an individual finds his place in society. By expressing oneself and contributing to public discourse, one is able to clarify what they think and to construct their own understanding of the world and their relationship to it.? ?
The work of John Stuart Mill, written in the 1800s, still remains incredibly-pertinent today. Here are three key points summarised from his essay ?On Liberty?;? ?
?
1) Restricting speech always runs the risk of suppressing ideas which have value to society. It only strengthens the established view.? ?
2) In an argument with opposing sides, usually each side will contain at least some degree of truth. And it is only when ideologies clash that the real truth is revealed.? ?
3) Even if the established view is correct, if people are not repeatedly challenged by opposing views, they will only be indoctrinated and will be unable to justify their
position when faced with the other side. Their ideas will be fragile and they will be unable to construct their own or effectively advocate their own viewpoints.? ?
?
What Mill?s ideas show is that the restriction of free expression from public discourse always runs the risk of the stultification of societal progress.? ?
The thing is, everyone loves free speech. Or at least, their own free speech. It?s the speech of other people that they become most concerned about.?
Hate speech laws have a history of being a rather ineffective way of countering a society?s problems. In the Weimar Republic of Germany, during the rise of the Nazis, there were established hate speech laws in place. Some of the most prominent Nazis such as Joseph Goebbels and Julius Streicher were prosecuted for anti-Semitic speech. The effect of this was that they received the kind of public platform and attention that they would not have otherwise. It ended up reinvigorating their supporters. This isn?t to deny the terrible effect of Nazi propaganda in bolstering anti-Semitic views -- but to show that hate speech laws aren?t always the magical answer to combatting dangerous ideologies.? ?
Here in Sri Lanka, the response to recent communal riots was to temporarily ban social media. An extraordinary move indeed. We should ask ourselves whether it was Facebook that caused the riots in 1915, the 1970s, the 1980s. Or is it a convenient excuse to stifle criticism of the government?s handling of the crisis and to ignore the root causes of these issues. It is often difficult to distinguish between speech that directly causes harmful views, and speech that is symptomatic of certain views developing within society.? ?
Whenever faced with the question of restricting speech, consider who judges the judges of speech? If we can?t even trust the government with the Central Bank,? can we be confident in giving up our personal autonomy to allow the government to decide what you can think and say? Would we give them the power to criminalise ideas over actions???
In the legal field, people call this the slippery slope argument -- that allowing one thing will risk opening the floodgates for all sorts of other bad things. But I would perhaps suggest, that giving up the power over speech to a government such as this, would not only be a slippery slope, but a steep and dangerous cliff indeed.? ?

Dudley Senanayake Commemorative Oration - on September 14 : Dudley, the Only Liberal Democrat  in SL
	
When the Father and Son ?Clashed???
?
?
in May 1915, the Colonial Government arrested Temperance movement leaders under the pretext of controlling?racial riots
	?
	An uncorrupt politician with no malice in his heart; it is very sad that there isn?t a single politician of his calibre in the present Parliament
	?
	He never pleaded for leadership, and never planned to consolidate his place in the party through manipulations
	?
	The father never interfered in his son?s political activities
	?
	he never accepted a powerless PM?s post or power shared with one above him, but as the sole Head of the nation
?
D. S. Senanayake was a man of restricted book education but of incredible sophisticated wisdom. His eldest son an illustrious product of S. Thomas? College, and blessed with an adorable personality, young Dudley Shelton, ?Shelley? to close acquaints, showed little attention to marriage. The Senanayakes of Botale Walawwa in?
Salpitigama Korale were well enriched in politics by the second decade of the 20th century with Senanayake brothers DC, FR and DS spearheading the Independence and temperance movements.? ?
While father D. S. Senanayake supported the second World War effort, Dudley and J R were indifferent; they considered that by extending support to the enemy we could achieve independence quickly. Both of them visited the Japanese Consul in Colombo and expressed their support to Japan. DS, the Head of State was furious over the high-handed act of the two young Ministers, and to their shock and surprise, they were thoroughly chastised by him. Further if not for the father?s influence and excellent relations with the Governor Caldecott, the two radicals would have been arrested and indicted. Apart from this incident the father never interfered in his son?s political activities.??
Our young minister once wrote to father DS, for the senior Senanayake to reply allowing the son full freedom to oppose him at the Cabinet? and criticize him openly; lessons for the present generation of politicians, both the seniors and juniors who think their word should be the final and the rest would have little say....; but follow the leader or face consequences. Dudley wrote:??
?Dear father, the two of us are under the same roof. As your son I find it difficult to act in this manner. Sometimes I cannot agree with some of the proposals made by you to the State Council on behalf of the Board of Ministers. On many occasions I have to steadfastly oppose you. Such a thing happened today also. It caused me severe mental distress. So I have decided to resign from the State Council.? ? Dudley??
Father replied: ?Although you are my son you have full freedom to oppose me at any moment. I brought you up and educated you to enable you to be an independent man and act according to your conscience. I am proud that you have been able to express your views before the State Council in a fearless and forthright manner. It will never harm our relationship as father and son.? ? DS?
?
The ?tiny tot? celebrated father?s arrest
During the height of communal violence? in late May 1915, the Colonial Government arrested Temperance movement leaders under the pretext of controlling racial riots; they feared that the temperance movement would turn out to be a ?freedom fighter? in time to come. One morning the three-and-a-half-year-old Dudley was having an ?encounter? with his maid over breakfast when soldiers arrived at their residence, Woodlands in Borella.? They have come to arrest the 30 year-old D. S. Senanayake. One of the Punjabi soldiers pushed away the ayah who argued, protested and intervened the attempt by soldiers to bundle up her master into a military truck. The three-and-half-year-old Dudley, clueless of what was going on did not apprehend the seriousness of the drama, but only enjoyed the fun seeing his b?te noire at that moment, the maid, lying on the floor being ?punished?- as recalled by this affable man, the sad tale, later in life.??
?
Lessons in politics through horse riding and cricket??
The newly elected member representing Negombo in the Legislative Council (1924), D. S. Senanayake would put the two brothers Dudley and Robert, 13 and 11 respectively on their horses, and tie the pedals to the saddle. As Dudley nervously held on to the saddle, father would whip the horse on its? rear. Dudley was compelled to maintain his balance for fear of a fall; the lesson, ?if you were scared, you would never learn to ride a horse?.??
Players, in the good old days were allowed to go home for snacks during play. Once Dudley was back at home during a cricket match. He was bleeding from the nose. Father DS, a cricketer himself who played for the same school S. Thomas? ignored the minor tragedy and asked the cricketing son,??
?How much did you score????
?Fifty two? said the son??
?Out for fifty two????
?No, retired hurt, a ball hit my nose. I need to rest???
?You see?, a retired hurt batsman can go and bat later in the innings???
Basic treatment with ice for his bleeding nose, and an aspirin for relief from pain; followed by refreshments, he was sent back to the ground by the father for the good batsman to complete his century. Dudley was back at the crease at the fall of the next wicket. Upon his return to the pavilion with a deserving century against his name on the board, the young batsman was greeted by a doctor who the father had sent to attend on the son?s bleeding nose: but, the million dollar question is, was DS successful in his effort to inspire the son with the idea of ?spirit and bravery?? The sensitive man ?Retired hurt? once again in 1953 unable to come to terms with his own conscience for signing the shoot-at-sight order during the violent ?Hartal? of August 12. However, like father, he knew the rules; and played by them.? ?
Both Dudley, and his brother Robert followed the father DS in captaining S. Thomas? College at cricket. Dudley shone in boxing, athletics, football, and hockey. He won the popular Victoria Gold Medal awarded to the Best All-Round Boy and also became College Head Prefect.??
?
Four times as PM: Incomparable
Dudley was a firm believer that public funds should not be used for private expenses as a public official. Throughout all his Premiership tenures he resided at his private residence Woodlands and insisted that expenses incurred in his private home must be met with by his personal funds. As Prime Minister, he twice travelled to the United States and to London for medical reasons but all expenses incurred by him and that of the consultants and para-medics who accompanied him, were met by his own funds ? something that is unheard of today.? ?
He never pleaded for leadership, and never planned to consolidate his place in the party through manipulations, but was selected unanimously; what is significant is not the number of times Dudley became the Prime Minister, but that three times he was elected by the people as the Head of State, [only after father?s death that he was sworn in] he never accepted a powerless PM?s post or power shared with one above him, but as the sole Head of the nation. In that sense Dudley Senanayake is incomparable. In 1952, he was chosen over a more senior member to be the Prime Minister. It happened after the tragic death of father D. S. Senanayake. But he was not contented; the staunch liberal democrat, dissolved Parliament and left the fate of the nation and the United National Party in the hands of the people who overwhelmingly voted him to lead the nation.??
An uncorrupt politician with no malice in his heart; it is very sad that there isn?t a single politician of his calibre in the present Parliament. For the sad state of affairs and what we are undergoing now in Sri Lanka, Dudley, the true statesmen would certainly pray for us.
?
?Fathers and Sons? ?the Sportsman Dudley
Writing to Sunday Observer on 22nd April 1973, was Kirthie Abeyesekera: who says, ?In April 1963, the man who left no offspring and heir to carry the Senanayake name, played for a ?Fathers? Cricket XI. Dudley then Leader of the Opposition took part in a ?by St Thomas? Preparatory, Bandarawela, when the ?sons? played against the ?fathers? - ?I do not know by what stretch of imagination they have included me in this team,? perhaps for the cricketer who led S. Thomas? in the early thirties, the temptation to play the game was too strong to resist, so he accepted the request and played. Abeyesekera added, ?Dudley who declined the captaincy in that match because , ?I really have no right to play at all,? played a grand innings, top scoring with 47, in a hectic bowling spell he took 4 wickets for 23 runs.?? ?
The ?reluctant captain? was a brilliant all rounder in the political field as well, who honoured the rules to the letter and spirit.? ?
?Power has only one duty - to secure the social welfare of the People.? - Benjamin Disraeli??

Exhibiting a nation we can call our own
	
ColomboNationalMuseum
?
The British were smart, all things considered. They didn?t just destroy our cultural artefacts like the Portuguese and Dutch did, they took them away and then turned them into exhibits. I know enough and more people who claim that this is (somehow) proof of their benevolence and that those artefacts are better protected in London than in Colombo. I won?t argue, especially because we don?t have a squeaky clean record when it comes to preserving our own treasures, but I will say this: preserved or not, those treasures are still ours. And preserved or not, it doesn?t erase the fact that their forced eviction from the home country constituted theft. Newspaper editorials which shout whenever Sri Lankans, especially Sinhalese Buddhists, ?allegedly? vandalise cultural sites belonging to other ethnicities seem to go dumb over this hard reality.?
I was thinking of this business of preserving and exhibiting cultural artefacts looted from other countries some time back. I was amazed at the rate at which this industry has grown over the years. Were it not for that industry, Keats may never have written his better known odes (like ?On a Grecian Urn?) and for all we know the world would have forgotten that there was such a thing as a Koh-I-Noor.?
This is not to suggest that the British were doing us any favours by taking those treasures away. Let?s not forget that the British Museum was run to empower the ?other side? of colonialism, and that over the decades it became the repository of orientalism, which as everyone (even the orientalists) know is a polite term for cultural condescension. Still, a few charitable thoughts are, I feel, called for.?
The British Museum is the world?s oldest national public museum. It is not run to yield a profit. It is not run as a corporation. Unlike the Colombo Museum, which charges fees ranging from Rs.30 (for locals) to Rs.500 (for foreigners), it is, barring the occasional exhibition, free. Operated and managed as a non-departmental public body (a public body not attached to a government department), it is financed by donations, legacies, and trading activities including but not limited to onsite retailing, corporate hire, sponsorship incomes, and of course catering. From 2001 to 2018, a space of more than 15 years, grants from the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport have oscillated from 35 to 40 million pounds annually, a figure which has survived the austerity cuts of the David Cameron regime. The British clearly love their artefacts, even if they were looted from the colonies, and they clearly are committed to the preservation of them.?
So clearly, while museums in general have become a profit-driven industry, the British Museum has not become a business by any stretch of the imagination. There are no entrance fees, except for the occasional donation-requirement, and apart from a few items here and there the cost of a visit is virtually zero. And yet, even with this absence of a profit motive, the British Museum is thriving. It has a firm governance structure (with 25 trustees), the largest online database of objects from any museum collection (more than two million object entries). In 2013, it attracted 20% more visitors than it did in 2012, an impressive rise considering that these were years of heavy funding cuts. The British love their history, even if their history is smudged with ours, and their connoisseurship deserves more than just a customary clap.?
Sri Lanka, on the other hand, is not so fortunate. The Colombo Museum has entrance fees, a ready source of income if ever there was one, given that it attracts a sizeable crowd even today, but then as one commentator put it in an article months ago, we still have not been able to transform it into more than just a series of exotic exhibits. Put simply, we exhibit our history the same way we teach it to our children: a set of dates, events, and carefully marked items to look at and note down.?
?
And it?s not just the Colombo Museum. Sri? Lanka presently has three other national museums, in Kandy, Ratnapura, and Galle. Then there are the other subsidiary sites, like the Folk Museum in Anuradhapura and the Independence Memorial Museum in Colombo. They are all run by one government department or the other, including the Department of Archaeological Survey, which oversees 27 such museums. All these departments, moreover, centre around one public authority: the Central Cultural Fund (CCF), established in 1981 to preserve important sites along the Cultural Triangle. For the purpose of comparison, the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport took 16 more years to be established.?
And yet, even with all these bureaucratic safeguards, can one really say that we have opened our cultural artefacts to our own people, let alone outsiders? Isn?t it an irony that while museums in the developed world have been transformed successfully from colonialist enterprises to contemporary institutions, our main public museum remains a pale replica of those colonial era projects? The purpose of such places is to offer the discerning observer a sense of order in the exhibiting and unveiling of history. Is such a purpose being met here?? The problem gets even more complicated when we consider the attitude towards our own history that has been nurtured among us. We spend 10 or 11 years memorising dates and events without being able to identify or make connections between one era and another. We think that by remembering those dates and events, we can remember history. But ?history,? as scholars and amateurs alike will tell you, cannot be boiled down to what can be remembered this way. ?History? is made up of certain cosmetics, and it is those cosmetics which museums must endeavour to reveal and, in a manner of speaking, undress for us.?
There are myths associated with historical events and there are links between certain disparate historical phenomena. Would there have been a massive irrigation network and hydraulic civilisation in Sri? Lanka without the advent of Buddhism, to give just one example? My guess is no, but textbooks hardly delve into why this may be so. To understand what these connections are, you need to go beyond the classroom. And museums are an integral part of that beyond-the-classroom experience. It is an experience that today has become limited to the occasional school visit.?
Professor K.M. de Silva tried over several decades in his ?History of Sri Lanka? to chart the trajectory of our civilisation through those aforementioned links. As of the latest edition, the book tries admirably to sustain our interest in our past, and for this reason it is the definitive work on local history in English. Not that there haven?t been other endeavours of course, but the difference with Professor de Silva?s work is that it offers an entire spectacle, a combination of close-ups and long shots that provides an accurate, if not multifarious, perspective of our heritage.?
Apart from certain biases and prejudices which crop up (in particular, his view of Zheng He, the Chinese maritime explorer, as a crude imperialist who sought to steal the Dantha Dathuwa, when the reasons for his invasion of Kotte and ?abduction? of Vijayabahu VI are much more complex than that), de Silva?s book treats history as a material reality with spiritual undercurrents (which means that even that most hailed of all irrigation equipment, the bisokotuwa, was the definitive product of a civilisation run along Buddhist lines), which I think is a far superior approach to the subject than the series of conquests and defeats we are forced to vomit at the exam hall every year.?
It is said that we have become indifferent to culture. But what is culture? Is it, as the orientalists will have you imagine, a set of unique exotic identifiers that demarcate a non-Western civilisation? Or is it, as the Marxists will have you believe, one of many superstructures through which the real history, the oppression of the underprivileged, is erased if not whitewashed??
I believe it is neither. ?Culture? as is understood in the Western sense is a product or consequence (or baby) of the Industrial Revolution, which as Ananda Coomaraswamy has pointed out managed to differentiate between objects of mass consumption and objects of artistic edification. Coomaraswamy saw this as a debasement of human values. I would agree. In that regard, culture has become an esoteric enterprise.?
It was not always like this, though, since in the early days, there was nothing that could actually be detached from common experience and exhibited in the name of ?art? or ?history.? On the contrary, it was the seamless fusion of the material and the metaphysical which produced the ?culture? our ancestors venerated ages ago. The more we understand this, the more we will realise where we are going wrong, and where the British Museum curators are not. But will it be too late by the time we do realise? I sincerely hope not.?

Facial scars can be removed permanently
	
?
The face is a very important organ in the human body. Maintaining a beautiful face becomes increasingly important with the development of the social status of a country. The face is the main organ involved with social relationships and it contributes a lot to one?s personality. In an interview with Health Capsule, Dr. A. Shashanka Rathnayake, Consultant Plastic & Reconstructive Surgeon Teaching Hospital - Kandy shared his knowledge with us on how facial scars can be removed permanently. Excerpts of the interview:? ?
?
QWhat is the role of the plastic surgeon who treats facial scars?
The face is a very important organ to the human being. It becomes more and more important with the development of the social status of a country. The face is the main organ involved with the social relationships and it contributes a lot to one?s personality.? ?
There is an increasing enthusiasm on the erasing the facial scars and the improvement in the facial aesthetics. The plastic surgeons around the world are involved in the management of facial scars and aesthetics. Their training in the delicate surgery helps in achieving better outcome from the various procedures.? ?

The plastic surgeons around the world are involved in the management of facial scars and aesthetics. Their training in the delicate surgery helps in achieving better outcome from the various procedures
QCan the plastic surgical procedures erase a scar?
?In fact this is the expectation of patients all the time and it is our endeavour too. However there are limitations in some cases. Honestly we cannot erase a scar as it is done after a filming session with an actor who has placed an artificial scar. However, we can minimise a scar.? ?
As you know we have facial creases. These creases are very visible in an old face. If the scars lie in parallel to the facial creases the appearance of the scar would be more pleasing and minimally visible at a distance.? ?
?
QAre there different types of scars?
Briefly there are two types: Hypertrophic scars which means a growing up scar and an Atrophic scar which means of a failure of normal healing.? ?
Hypertrophic scars - In some patients would become angry during the healing process when the scar becomes prominent and protruding above the level of the normal skin. Usually these scars are annoying and aesthetically poor.? ?
?Atrophic scars - These are flat and stretched scars. They usually result in poor repair of the facial injuries. The face has got a muscle layer under the skin which helps in the facial expressions. When there is a deep injury to the face involving the muscle layer it should be repaired carefully, if not the wound healing may not be appropriate and the scar will stretch.? ?
?
QHow do you manage these different types of scars?
The hypertrophic scars can be prevented by applications of a gel at initial stages. But when it is established, it may need surgical removal which will be followed by scar therapy. Some of the hypertrophic scars may respond to steroid injections. But it may be very painful to inject steroids into facial scars.? ?
?The atrophic scars need a redo repair of the facial injury and the applications of the creams are not going to be helpful. If the facial injury lies parallel to the facial, it creases the outcome. Anyway after a proper repair of an atrophic scar one has to follow scar therapy protocols.? ?
?
QDo you have any secrets in achieving better results in plastic surgery?
Well people think plastic surgeons are having secrets in achieving results. It is not unreasonable also to think like that. Anyway it is the delicate handling of the human tissues and attention to detail that gives the best outcomes.? ?
?
QWhat techniques are available to improve the facial appearance?
There is an increasing enthusiasm on the improvement of the facial appearance among the women especially. The skin colour of the face is of primary concern. Many patients request some treatment to become fair. There are several treatments available in achieving a fair skin. However it is important to understand that getting an even pigmentation is the most important thing as per the facial aesthetics are concerned.? ?
?There are injections ( Glutathione) available which will destroy the melanin in our skin cells and are not recommended by the drug authorities. These injections are being used for melanin destruction to relieve symptoms of melanoma ( skin cancer) which has spread all over the body.
The use of these injections in healthy humans who want to have a better appearance could give harmful results and death may result.? Anyway there are drugs which can be used carefully to have a fair and evenly pigmented skin of the face. Use of a sunscreen is very important in a country like ours as the number one enemy of the facial skin is? sunburn.? ?
In addition, there are chemical peels and laser techniques which can improve the appearance of the face.??

Israel reopens its sole people crossing with Gaza
	
?
JERUSALEM AFP Sept13, 2018? -Israel reopened its only crossing for people with the Gaza Strip on Thursday, more than a week after shutting it following a destructive Palestinian protest.??
The reopening follows several days of relative calm, as Egyptian and UN officials attempt to broker a long-term truce between Israel and Gaza?s Islamist rulers Hamas.??
A spokeswoman for the Israeli defence ministry unit that oversees the Erez crossing confirmed it had reopened on Thursday.??
On September 5, the army said that hundreds of ?rioters? had vandalised the Gaza side of the crossing, and that it would remain closed until the damage was repaired.??
Israel has enforced an air, land and sea blockade on the Gaza Strip for more than a decade, but grants permission to a limited number of people to cross.??
An average of around 1,000 Gazans cross through Erez each day, mostly those in need of medical care but also businesspeople, students and others, Israeli authorities say.??
A second crossing with Israel, Kerem Shalom, is for goods only.?

Lucky beneficiaries of special Subha Yogas

?
?
Astrology is the study of the influence that planets and the stars that work on the human beings and all terrestrial events. The Sun and the Moon though not planets in an astronomical sense are treated as planets for the purpose of this study.?
Predictions based on positions of planets
The planets are continuously moving in a circular celestial path called the Zodiac and the horoscope or the Natal Chart cast based on the celestial map showing the positions of the stars and the planets in the Zodiac at a given moment of the birth of an individual is used as a tool to predict the fortunes and misfortunes in store for him or her.?
Zodiac and 12 signs
The Zodiac is divided into 12 divisions called Signs or Rashis and the weakness or the strength of a planet depends on the Rashi it is passing through at a given moment. The degree of the influence that a planet produces on an individual depends on the strength it commands while passing through a Sign.?
A rare phenomenon
It is seldom that two or more planets are found placed at the same time in favourable Signs where they are unusually strong. However, this phenomenon occurred when Venus began its passage in the Sign of Libra at 21.22 hours on September 19, this year where it acquires a special strength called Moolatrikona Swakshetra. This event occurred when Mars was already passing through the Sign of Capricorn powered with a special strength called exalted status.
Mercury to attain exaltation in Virgo?
Meanwhile, Mercury is due to move into the Virgo sign at 04.16 hours on September 19 where it will remain till 12.44 hours on October 6 commanding exalted status. This means the children born during the period from 21.22 hours on September 1 to 12. 44 hours on October 06 should greatly benefit from two especially strong planets Venus and Mars occupying the Libra and Capricorn signs in their horoscope and some of these newborns will gain greater benefit by way of special favourable yogas resulting from these two planets being placed in certain Houses in the horoscope.?
Three planets with special strength?
Meanwhile, the children born during the period from 04.16 hours on September 19 to 12.44 hours on October 06 will greatly benefit from three especially strong planets, Mars, Venus and Mercury and some of them will be beneficiaries of favourable yogas.
The special benefit resulting from Mercury gaining exalted status will cease by October 06.?
However, the newborns will continue to benefit from the special strength of Mars and Venus until the former exits from the Capricorn sign for Aquarius at 08.23 hours on November 06?this year.?
The following tables show the special favourable yogas the newborn natives are due to benefit from Mars, Venus and Mercury gaining special strength, depending on their Lagna (Ascendant).?
Children born from 21.22 hours on September 1, 2018 up to 04.16 hours on September 19, 2018
Mars will cease to produce favourable yogas when it moves into Aquarius sign at 08.23 hours on November 06 although Venus will remain in its exalted status placed in Libra sign until 20.43 hours on January 01, 2019. Therefore, Mars and Venus will continue to produce favourable yogas from 12.45 hours on October 06 to 08.23 hours on November 06 as shown in the Table 1 above.? ?
The benefits of the aforesaid favourable yogas confer are briefly as follows:?Amala Yoga:? ?Fame, good character, a charitable disposition and success in the profession.Bhadra Yoga: Intelligence, high learning, generosity towards relatives and skill in many arts.Harsha Yoga: Physical strength,? happiness and a good temperament.?Malavya Yoga: A graceful appearance, a happy life,? luxuries and a high position in a cultural organization.Ruchaka Yoga: Leadership qualities, boldness and being enterprising.Sarala Yoga:? Longevity, fearlessness, learning, fame and prosperity.Vimala Yoga: An altruistic bent, a sharp perception, a positive outlook, happiness and a sense?of independence.

Namal and the Sinhala Crown Prince Syndrome
	
Janabalaya Kolombata mass protest that immediately had many post-mortems conducted on it, was concluded as one engineered to project young Namal Rajapaksa as the Crown Prince of the Rajapaksas.
Some insanely anti-Rajapaksa social media activists, including those planted for that very purpose, went on a blitzkrieg displaying their ignorance and indecency more than any other.
There was nothing unusual with Namal taking the lead with other JO and SLPP stalwarts sitting around him at media briefings.
Mahinda and Shiranthi as parents planned to make Namal the Crown Prince over a long time. Could that come as reality is a different discussion.
The Hambantota District was ear-marked and reserved for Namal from day one. Thus Chamal Rajapaksa?s eldest son Shashi Rajapaksa was moved to Moneragala and made the Uva Province Chief Minister.
Basil Rajapaksa, who was Private Secretary to Mahinda, when Mahinda was elected Beliatte MP in 1970 and managed all Hambantota election campaigns for Mahinda, went to contest the Gampaha District. Hambantota was from where Namal had to enter politics.
?
In politically intelligent democratic societies, with democratic political parties and democratic traditions, this is not how leaders are elected.
Yet, in our society where democracy is the namesake, procedural and dysfunctional, and continues with feudal values, traditions and bondages, what else can there be?
?
Nothing but feudal
The Anuradhapura kingdom was handed over by King Mutaseeva to his four sons, Devanam Piyatissa, Uttiya, Mahasiva and Mahanaga, who ruled Anuradhapura one after the other, except Mahanaga.
Devanam Piyatissa?s consort Ramadhatta conspired to kill Mahanaga to have her son on the throne?after Mahasiva.
The conspiracy failed but made Mahanaga flee Anuradhapura with his family and establish himself as the first king of Ruhuna.
		
			" Mahinda and Shiranthi planned to make Namal the Crown Prince over a long time "
			?
			
		After King Dutugemunu, the Anuradhapura kingdom was handed over to brother Saddhatissa. His four sons LanjaTissa, Thulattana, Kallata and Walagamba ruled Anuradhapura.
Once deposed by Dravidian rulers, Walagamba who regained power the second time, was succeeded thereafter by his nephew Mahachula Mahatissa and son Chora Naga.
This remained the tradition till the fall of the last kingdom in Kandy. The only deviation was when Queen Anula decided who would sit on the throne as she pleases and that only for a very short period of five years.
?
Modern feudalism
Feudal as we are, this tradition continues to date in our mainstream political parties in post-Independence Sri Lanka.
The first PM of independent Lanka Mahamanya D.S. Senanayake was the first to have his son ascend premiership, after his demise. In 1947, the first Parliament of independent Ceylon with D.S. Senanayake as PM had leading figures like R.G. Senanayake and Sir John Kotalawala, both close relatives of Senanayake and also J.R. Jayewardene and S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike as formidable leaders in his UNP Government.
Bandaranaike having bargained for leadership and disappointed, left the Government in September 1951 to form his own SLFP.
Six months later, PM Senanayake had a tragic death riding his horse at Galle Face Green in March 1952. This created a tussle for Premiership that was intervened with stealth by the then UNP General Secretary Sir Ukwatte Jayasundera, a very respected criminal lawyer, Sir Oliver Gunathilake, always granted to be a top manipulator, and by Sir Ivor Jennings, respected by all parties to have Dudley Senanayake, the son, as PM.
The SLFP differs less. Bandaranaike came to power in a popular coalition with Philip Gunawardena in 1956.
Most tragically he was assassinated in September 1959.
W. Dahanayake was then appointed PM and he dissociated himself from the SLFP forming his own political party the Lanka Prajathanthrawadi Pakshaya (LPP).
After four months of survival politics, a general election was held in March 1960.
Dudley Senanayake had returned to politics to lead the party (Bothale Walauwa had a very strong claim for leadership in UNP), but could not win a majority. The SLFP led by that astute politician C.P de Silva, born in Randombe, Balapaitiya, reduced UNP to 50 seats, winning 46 for the SLFP.
Governor General Sir Oliver Gunathilake, who could have asked C.P de Silva to form a Government (Was possible with many anti-UNP groups counting around 15 MPs) instead called for another election in July 1960.
The SLFP leadership that included very influential politicians like T.B Ilangaratne and Badi-ud-din Mahmud wanted certain victory and believed Sirimavo, the widow of late Bandaranaike, would be the answer.
She was brought on stage and having won the elections, was appointed a Senator to be the first woman PM in the world. The SLFP thus came to be sealed as the property of Bandaranaikes.
Their son Anura Bandaranaike, who came to politics in 1977 contesting the multi-seat Nuwara-Eliya electorate, was made a Senior Vice President of SLFP over and above Maithripala Senanayake, who was even senior to Madam Bandaranaike in the SLFP.
Almost 20 years junior in politics to even Mahinda Rajapaksa, Anura was promoted as National Organiser of the party without any objections.
In 1994 Chandrika Kumaratunga, who defected with her husband Vijaya Kumaratunge, the popular film idol to form the SLMP in 1982 was brought back to the party to lead the 1994 August elections.
Her only qualification, being the daughter of the two Bandaranaike Prime Ministers.
?
When a dynasty folds up
The ancient tradition is such where a dynasty ends with none to succeed, another influential family steps in. With the demise of Dudley Senanayake in 1973 April, J.R. Jayewardene, with a strong claim to UNP leadership took over the party.
In 1975 with amendments to the party Constitution he became its almighty leader.
While promoting young lawyers like Lalith Athulathmudali and Gamini Dissanayake, he also brought his nephew Ranil Wickremesinghe into party hierarchy.
Young Wickremesinghe was never seen in politics until he was elected to Parliament for the first time from Biyagama in 1977.
He was immediately appointed Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs and President Jayewardene felt he should be further promoted and was made a Minister be the youngest in Jayawardene?s Cabinet.
Wickremesinghe?s rise to UNP leadership, no doubt, was due to the untimely and tragic deaths of President Premadasa and 1994 Presidential candidate Gamini Dissanayake.
Yet, it would not have been possible without his kinship to Jayewardene.
Lined up again for UNP leadership is Wickremesinghe?s close relative Ruwan Wijewardne, who was made State Minister of Defence in Ranil Wickremesinghe?s present Government.
The only exception to this long historical tradition is President Premadasa. He left his family totally outside his politics.
That being a very rare exception, the old feudal tradition wasn?t lost even in the Trotskyite Sama Samaja Party.
Having lost all its rich democratic traditions by 1970s, Prof Tissa Vitharana was made Leader of the LSSP as he was a nephew of Dr N.M Perera.
?
With Indian feudalism
Feudalism isn?t absent even in Indian mainstream politics. The Indian Congress that grew with the Indian Freedom Movement formed the first Government in independent India in 1947, with Jawaharlal Nehru the most respected Congress leader as PM.
His stature bound with India?s feudalism brought his daughter Indira Gandhi to Congress leadership and was twice PM of India.
When she was assassinated by a Sikh soldier, the Congress brought her eldest son Rajiv Gandhi to fill her vacancy. The repeat was when LTTE assassinated Rajiv Gandhi.
His Italian born wife Sonia Gandhi was made the Congress leader and their son Rahul Gandhi succeeded as Congress leader.
Seventy years after independence, feudalism in India has Nehru?s great-grandson carrying the family leadership in the Congress.
?
Now with Rajapaksas
The Rajapaksas too have a long political history. Hambantota came to be their bastion of power with D.M Rajapaksa elected to the State Council in 1935. His sudden demise brought his younger brother D.A. Rajapaksa, an idling petty landowner to fill his vacancy.
D.M?s sons, Lakshman and George were still schooling. They both entered politics on their father?s heritage, while Mahinda entered politics after his father?s demise, followed much later by elder brother Chamal.
From D.M?s lineage, Nirupama, the daughter of George Rajapaksa came to politics long after George passed off and Namal is already lined up behind Mahinda.
This is no rural tradition though. Urban professionals in Colombo who believe Gotabhaya should be the next Sinhala Buddhist Presidential Candidate picked on him for his Rajapaksa lineage.
The right to decide who the Crown Prince will be is no responsibility of the urban Sinhala Buddhist Professionals. That is the sole responsibility of the Rajapaksa family.
Though not the eldest in the family, Mahinda is their most popular undisputed political King.
It was Mahinda who therefore decided on the Crown Prince. Once Mahinda decided, though, with reservations, others did accept.
This is no family arrogance as diehard anti-Rajapaksa urbanites keep saying. It is the old feudal heritage this blinded society carries along.
It thus allows political parties to drive along without any answers to the most demanding issues in society. There is no effort made to understand what goes wrong, where and how. In short, this society feels satisfied with a new leader brought on feudal traditions, whatever the shade of the candidate.
Unless this ancient feudal tradition is challenged and concrete answers are demanded on major social issues, Sri Lanka would have to live with lesser mortals every time a leader is?selected and elected.

No email-hacking: SLC
	
Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) officials yesterday said there was enough evidence gathered from its initial internal investigations into the alleged attempt by an employee to embezzle the US $5.5 million of funds due to SLC, to conclude that no email-hacking had taken place.
The employee in question ? who SLC officials refused to identify by name, only stating he was the Head of Finance ? had been put on compulsory leave until the completion of the investigation being carried out by the Criminal Investigation Division (CID), SLC Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Ashley de Silva said yesterday.
The employee had sent an email to Sri Lanka?s international television rights partners Sony Pictures Network with a falsified board paper which stated that a payment due for the upcoming England series be made to an offshore account, along with a falsified invoice with the details of that offshore account in Hong Kong.
?The board paper had been signed by three employees of the Finance Division, but the two other individuals had claimed during the internal inquiry that their signatures had been forged, and therefore there was insufficient proof of their involvement,? de Silva said.
?We have sent the Head of Finance on compulsory leave because he has been corresponding with Sony in the past and also since the email with the falsified information was sent from his account.?
What was sufficiently proven in the internal inquiry, de Silva said, was that the email had originated from within SLC?s servers, which was echoed by SLC?s IT Manager Nadeeshan Suriyaarachchige.
?Fake email addresses, using the names of the CEO (Ashley de Silva) and COO (Jerome Jayaratne) were used. During the initial investigation, we recovered all the digital data and that is how we have evidence that this was not as a result of email hacking,? Suriyaarachchige said.
It was previously reported by the media that the individual, who is now on compulsory leave, had claimed that his email had been hacked and as such was not involved in this attempted fraud.
SLC?s Competent Authority (CA) Kamal Pathmasiri, who is also the Secretary to the Minister of Sports, said that those involved will be punished if enough evidence came to light.
?We will take whatever action necessary (to punish anyone involved) but only after we can prove it within a legal framework,? he said. (Shehan Daniel)

Two chandeliers costing Rs. 4 million had been purchased for the new assembly hall of a main provincial body in the country, they say.
?
The politico ruling the roost at the provincial body has reportedly developed a craze to transform this body into a virtual replica of the country?s august council. And he had been liberally disbursing the council funds to achieve this goal from the time he took the high office.
?What is good for the main august assembly should be good enough for our assembly too,? the politico has been repeatedly telling, they say.

This female white-collar high-up is an intimate of a prominent politico who is expected to assume duties as the political chief in her area shortly.
?
The news that her intimate is about to become the big political boss in the province had re-kindled her hope of gaining a high office she had long coveted. However, it had dawned on her that a certain popular white collar one functioning as a deputy resident manager would become a formidable rival and fearing he would shatter her cherished hope she had gone into action to prevent this eventuality.
The deputy resident manager who had earned a reputation as a people-friendly public servant had suddenly received an order transferring him from his ?sand-mount? zone to a distant ?sand-lake? zone. However, it had become an open secret that the ambitious lady had been behind this transfer order evidently without rhyme or reason.
The People in an area looked on as a historic city, directly concerned over this transfer are reportedly saying, ?Madam has begun her antics!?

Predicament  of Tamil moderates
	
?
Sumanthiran?s statement portrayed as a betrayal of Tamils
	The ordeal moderate politics has to undergo in the face of its respective extremisms
	The TNA would have a further tough time ahead
?
In politics or war, one should not give ammunition to the enemies. But Tamil National Alliance (TNA) Parliamentarian M.A. Sumanthiran who is also the Spokesman of the Tamil coalition has given not just a little ammunition, but an ammunition dump, to his opponents in the North, which the latter seem to be using against him these days, liberally.
The Tamil political parties rival to the TNA are gunning for Sumanthiran after he made a conciliatory statement on the resolution of the ethnic problem through the proposed new Constitution at a meeting held in Sinhalese dominated Galleon August 30.
Responding to a question by a participant of the meeting whether Tamils needed only Federalism, the TNA Spokesman had replied in the negative but explained what they stood for which in fact was Federalism, in essence.
The question posed to him at the meeting might definitely have landed him in a Catch-22 situation.
In a mainly Sinhalese audience, had he answered the question in the affirmative he would have faced a barrage of hostile questions.
On the other hand, he would have to face the wrath of his Tamil opponents and rivals, in the event he said ?no? to the question.
?
The UNP and the SLFP, which faced a humiliating defeat at the February 10 Local Government elections are not likely to take a risk at the next national elections by giving into the TNA demands, in their effort to resolve the ethnic problem
?
Thus, he seems to have chosen not to give an emphatic yes or no answer, but to explain his party?s stance, with a slight pacific slant towards the audience.
?We need not a solution in the form of a Federal set up. Neither do we demand a separate State, which we have abandoned in order to live in an indivisible country.
Therefore, it would be sufficient to make amendments to the Provincial Council system that would provide for the devolution of power in a manner that all communities would live with equal rights,? he had explained, according to Thinakkural.
The event was a seminar organized to create awareness on the progress of the Constitution-making process under the current regime and the 20th Amendment to the Constitution that was to be presented then, in Parliament by the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP). It was the seventh in a series of such meetings.
Two days later, on September 1, Tamil newspapers went public with the story with a headline ?We don?t want a Federal solution - Sumanthiran says in Galle.?
The news item with this headline was carried in Tamil newspapers at a time when Sumanthiran had become a thorn in the flesh of the opponents of the TNA, owing mainly to the fact that he was the one who countered most of their criticisms.
Besides, he is always in the news due to his relatively media friendly and conciliatory approach, apart from his knowledge in all three national languages.
The story might have been treated as a stroke of luck, especially by C.V.Wigneswaran, the Northern Province Chief Minister and Suresh Premachandran, the leader of the Eelam Peoples? Revolutionary Liberation Front (EPRLF), which broke away from TNA coalition last November.
They portrayed the statement as a betrayal of Tamils and questioned whether it was the official stand of the TNA.
They were joined by Gajendrakumar Ponnambalam, the leader of the Tamil National Peoples? Front (TNPF), which also had severed links with the coalition sometimes ago.
Besides, Prabha Ganesan, who is not representing either the North or the East, also had stated that Sumanthiran was planning to annihilate the Tamil Nation systematically.
The Northern rivals of the TNA took this as an opportunity to pit the other constituent parties of the TNA, the People?s Liberation Organisation of Tamil Eelam (PLOTE) and the Tamil Eelam Liberation Organisation (TELO) against the main party of the coalition the Ilankai Thamil Arasu Katchi (ITAK).
They questioned as to what the response was of those two parties to Sumanthiran?s statement, forcing them too to disown it.
On the same day newspapers published Sumanthiran?s statement, he clarified his position at a meeting with the northern journalists at his office in Point Pedro.
He denied that he renounced Federalism, as the headlines of the Tamil newspapers had claimed.
?Replying to a question I said, as usual, that we don?t need the Federalism in the signboard or in wordings which have been distorted to say that I renounced Federalism. I never said and would never say that we do not need Federalism.?
The TNA has been attacked on the same issue - compromising the Federal demand- though not with the same vehemence, since last October when the Interim Report of the Steering Committee of the Constitutional Assembly was submitted in Parliament by the Committee Chairman and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.
The Steering Committee had compiled this report after perusing the reports presented in November 2016 by the six subcommittees that had been appointed by the Constitutional Assembly to recommend Constitutional amendments on various sectors.
The Steering Committee report is not a final document but one for public discourse, it was said.
On the nature of the State, the report had recommended using the term Aekeeya Rajayaya in Sinhala and Orumiththa Nadu in Tamil and both Sinhalese and Tamil nationalists and extremists agitated against it.
Tamils said despite the fact that the Tamil term proposed was ambiguous the Sinhala term clearly represented the Unitary State.
The Sinhalese were up in arms claiming that the term? Orumiththa Nadu was a subtle usage of words to hide the Federal form of governance, in spite of the Sinhala term denoting Unitary State.
The drafters of the Steering Committee report seem to have attempted to pacify both the extreme forces in the south and the north but the conflicting meanings of the Sinhala and Tamil terms provoked both the groups.
However, TNA leader R. Sampanthan accepted the formula saying that he was satisfied with the Tamil term Orumiththa Nadu and it was a victory on the part of the Tamils to call Sri Lanka an Orumiththa Nadu.
From then on the TNA leadership was of the opinion that tags and labels used to describe the nature of the State were not important if the new Constitution provided for the adequate devolution of powers to the Tamils.
It was on this basis that Sumanthiran seems to have made his statement in Galle, but his blunt usage of words backfired.
He has been still defending the statement at various meetings. This incident points as to what an ordeal the moderate politics has to undergo in the face of its respective extremism.
When it comes to the ethnic problem and Constitution-making, the Governments ? present as well as past ? also have been facing the same fate, as both parties of a problem have to compromise their stances if they are to come to a just and durable agreement.
As an exception, President J.R. Jayewardene had to bulldoze through the Opposition, when he introduced the Provincial Council system, the only Constitutional change that was made in respect of the ethnic problem.
The TNA would have a further tough time ahead as the term of the Northern Provincial Council expires next month and the Government is preparing for the next Presidential and Parliamentary Elections.
NPC Chief Minister Wigneswaran is most unlikely to contest under the TNA at the next provincial council election in the light of the conflicts between him and the TNA leadership. This might push Wigneswaran further towards Tamil extremists.
On the other hand, the UNP, headed by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) of President Maithripala Sirisena which faced a humiliating defeat at the February 10 Local Government elections are not likely to take a risk at the next national elections by giving into the TNA demands, in their effort to resolve the ethnic problem.
Then, it would further strengthen the hands of the rivals of the TNA.

Progress of nuclear talks a ?daily concern?: S.Korea
	
?
Daily Mail, Sept 13 2018? -South Korea?s foreign minister said Thursday that making progress on denuclearisation talks with North Korea is a ?daily concern?, as she called for fresh momentum at a joint Korean summit next week.??
The meeting will be the third between the leaders of North and South Korea this year and comes as talks between Washington and Pyongyang over dismantling the North?s nuclear arsenal have stalled.??
US President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un met for a historic Singapore summit in June and pledged to denuclearise the Korean peninsula.??
However, no details were agreed, and Washington and Pyongyang have sparred since on what that means and how it will be achieved. Last month, Trump abruptly cancelled a planned visit by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to Pyongyang in a major setback.??
The new US envoy for the North, Stephen Biegun, said in August Kim had promised ?final, fully verified denuclearisation? at the Singapore summit.??
But Pyongyang has slammed Washington for its ?gangster-like? demands for complete, verifiable and irreversible disarmament.??
South Korea?s Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-wha Thursday urged progress on the talks and said the issue was a central issue for Seoul.??

Taking a close look at this cosmetic abnormality
	
Congenital anomalies are abnormalities that occur from the time of birth itself. Many of them happen due to a slight misstep in the normal, yet extremely intricate pathway of embryo formation where a single cell evolves into a complex human being.? ?
Cleft lip and cleft palate are two of the commonest congenital abnormalities doctors have to deal with. Going hand in hand, these two together can not only deform the face of the baby, but also make breastfeeding difficult or impossible, giving rise to many additional problems. But what is the outlook in these children? Fortunately, as with many other medical conditions, science has found solutions for cleft lip and palate. In this week?s issue of Health Capsule we have consulted Dr. Deepal Perera, Consultant Paediatrician at the Lady Ridgeway Hospital to obtain more information on these two conditions.?
?
Surgery for cleft lip is usually performed when the baby is 3 months old, while the recommended age for surgery for cleft palate is around 6 to 12 months ?
?
Formation of cleft lip and palate
Our skull is a result of fusion of several bones together during the fetal state. Cleft lip and palate occur when some of these bones fail to fuse together. Cleft lip occurs because two processes called maxillary and frontonasal process that participate in forming the facial structure in a fetus does not fuse like in a normal fetus. Cleft lip can be on one side as well as in both sides.? ?
?Similarly, in cleft palate, failure of fusion of two palatine processes forming the nasal bone occurs. According to the doctor, about 8 children among 1000 newborns have a cleft palate. Cleft lip and cleft palate can exist individually as well as together.? ?
?
Causes?
Cleft lip and palate has found to be polygenic, meaning that multiple genetic factors are involved in inheritance of this condition. In addition, this condition can present as a part of a syndrome where there are multiple abnormalities present, as well. One such example is Pierre Robin?s Syndrome. Mother?s health status and habits before pregnancy can also affect the occurrence of this condition. For an example, mothers who are on anticonvulsant medications like carbamazepine and sodium valproate, mothers who have been diagnosed with diabetes before pregnancy have a higher risk of giving birth to a child with cleft lip and palate. Antenatal folic acid supplementation on the other hand is found to decrease the risk of occurrence of the condition.? ?
?
Complications
Why are we so worried about this condition? The cosmetic abnormality in itself will be distressing to the child as well as the parents unless corrected early. In addition, more serious complications can also occur, especially in babies with a cleft palate. Here, since the palate is not fuse, the roof of the mouth is open to the nasal cavity above, which makes it difficult to breastfeed a child. Depending on the severity of the condition, special feeding devices, teats, and techniques can be used in feeding the baby until the abnormality is corrected.? ?
In addition, they are more prone to get middle ear infections, which may even lead to permanent deafness unless treated adequately.? ?
Delay in speech is another problem which is common in children with cleft lip and cleft palate, since the sound may not carry well in these children. In addition, it?s found that dental problems, including caries are also more common in these children.?
?
?
Treatment
Diagnosis of a cleft lip and palate can be made soon after birth or sometimes even when the mother is still pregnant, through an antenatal ultrasound scan.? ?
?Corrective surgery is the definite treatment and even though it will take time, the majority of children get to lead normal life with corrected deformities or complications.? ?
Surgery for cleft lip is usually performed when the baby is 3 months old, while the recommended age for surgery for cleft palate is around 6 to 12 months. Depending on the severity of the condition, multiple surgeries may be required over the course of years, but as previously stated, outlook is quite good in children with the condition.? A multidisciplinary team, consisting of doctors and therapists of various specialities should be involved in managing the child over the years. The team includes plastic surgeons, who will be in charge of determining the timing and other aspects of corrective surgery, ENT surgeons, dentists and speech therapists.? ?
?
Message to parents
Finding out that your child is having a facial deformity at birth will be quite distressing to a parent. But don?t let that diminish the happiness of welcoming the newest member of your family. Despite all the obstacles on the way, with your support and love, and the advanced medicine and surgery, your child is definitely looking towards a bright future.? ?

The brother who is certainly a contender - EDITORIAL
	
Former Defence Secretary and brother of ex-president Mahinda Rajapaksa, Gotabaya, got a hint that he could be the next possible candidate from the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) for future elections.?
Former President Rajapaksa told The Hindu in an interview that though he will lead the SLPP there was the likelihood that his brother could be a candidate from his newly formed party at future elections. Going by the context of elections and what?s been spoken of about his family and future elections this reference to a brother has to be about Gotabaya.?
Now we know for certain of one name in terms of who could be a possible SLPP candidate at future elections. But before his name was mentioned, Gotabaya, fondly known as Gota, went on promoting himself and the Viyathmaga programme he initiated to cement his place in politics.?
Gota officially entered politics just few months ago. Those who appose him will count this period in days; which for a fact is not much. But the people who oppose him know that he is made of substance and can present something impressive at a discussion. The problem would be that fact that this man has a reputation of getting about his work regardless of whether his plan inconveniences others or not. That?s the Gota we knew of when Rajapaksa was Sri Lanka?s president.?
Fast forward the time to 2018 and we now have a Gota who is talking about economic development and the need to work closely with business professionals. Is this change in approach to work now ?real? because earlier, in the role of a government servant, he was used to ordering people around.?
At a Viyathmaga forum held in May, Gota was quoted in newspapers saying that he wanted people to love their country and play their part in the future. These words are impressive, but detractors would say that this man once migrated abroad after quiting his job in the Sri Lanka Army.?
If anybody has thoughts of loving Gota or wants him as the next president, they are backed by the history associated with this person. Some would question whether a war expert is the ideal choice for the task of helping a nation release itself from its debt burden.?
Also Gota is one person questioned regarding the abduction of Keith Noyahr and the killing of Lasantha Wickremetunga, both who were career journalists in Sri Lanka.?
Gota is still to be officially announced as SLPP?s candidate for future elections. For this he has to receive the greenlight from both the party and the coalition, that?s backing Mahinda Rajapaksa.?
Gota?s patriotic talk will not be taken seriously by the wise voter unless he openly says that he would relinquish American citizenship and puts the interest of the country first.?
At this forum he had also stressed on the fact that economic growth and law and order went hand in hand. But others would recall that he once ordered a law enforcement officer in the capacity of a DIG to ?withdraw? when he went to check on a protest which featured Wimal Weerawansa.?
Gota is credited by many for making Colombo beautiful through some mind-boggling development work. But that is his soft side accompanied by the taskmaster he is.?

Threat to world court: Trump provokes emergence of dangerous world order
	
?
Months after United States troops invaded Afghanistan in October 2001, Mazar-i-Sharif earned the notoriety as the city of torture and extrajudicial killings, quite at variance with its worldwide fame as the city of Islamic and Hellenic architectural glory.??
It was also as paradoxical as it is shocking, for at the centre of the torture allegations was the United States, a country which till the September 11, 2001 terror attacks on New York and Washington DC had been seen to be championing human rights and democracy worldwide.
At the Mazar-i-Sharif prison, it is alleged that hundreds of detainees were subjected to severe forms of torture. Many died there or were taken to the nearby desert and killed.? ?Massacre at Mazar? was a name of a documentary Scots film producer Jamie Doran made. It was shown in the Reichstag, the German parliament building in Berlin and the European parliament in Strasbourg in July 2002. What the documentary had exposed was corroborated by a report the US Human Rights Group, Physicians for Human Rights, had released the same year. (https://www.scotsman.com/news/world/us-had-role-in-taleban-prisoner-deaths-1-609624).
The then US government advocated a culture of impunity, supporting even forms of torture such as waterboarding to elicit information from terror suspects, while a majority of US citizens, not in a proper state of mind after the shock of the 9/11, remained silent.? Their silence was licence for the George W. Bush administration to commit human rights violations in total disregard for international humanitarian laws and laws on warfare.
The ugly truth behind the US-led war on terror is that the US has committed war crimes and the US will not allow an international tribunal or another nation to bring US war crime suspects to justice.? Now whatever the faults of the US, since World War II ended, the rest of the world looked to it for global leadership.??
If leadership implies followership, the example the US sets with regard to the issue of war crimes only gives rise to a dangerous trend.? Already, with a maverick president in the White House, the international order is fast hurtling towards chaos because of US misbehavior.??
In yet another outlandish move, on Monday, the White House National Security Advisor, John Bolton, sounded like a bully to warn International Criminal Court judges, prosecutors and investigators that they would face sanctions and even arrest, if the world court took action to prosecute US soldiers for alleged war crimes committed in Afghanistan.??
Bolton, a neoconservative hawk, said to be one of the architects of the United States? illegal invasion of Iraq, has many a time in the past spoken contemptuously about international diplomacy which he has slammed as an affront to the US sovereignty.? He once infamously said if the United Nations building in New York ?lost 10 stories, it wouldn?t make a bit of difference.? Such was his scorn for the UN, though President Bush appointed him as the US ambassador to the UN.
Bolton?s full-scale attack on the ICC is not surprising. That his remarks had the backing of President Trump, who is equally contemptuous about international systems, is also not surprising. After all, Trump, claiming that climate change was a hoax invented by China, had withdrawn the US from the Paris climate deal, the United Nations Human Rights Council and has threatened to end the US membership in the World Trade Organisation.?
The ICC was set up in 2002 after years of negotiations in Rome and elsewhere.? The talks were held at a time when a new world order was emerging after the end of the Cold War. It was a period, when the sole superpower, the US, had been urged to play its global leadership role responsibly -- and more significantly, it was a period when consensus was being built up for an international world order based on respect for and strict adherence to human rights.? This was because the international community was feeling guilty of not taking effective action to stop genocides in Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia. Giving leadership to this campaign was the European Union -- with the US wavering, its eyes wide opened and mind fully occupied with the possible consequences if the Rome Statue was to become a reality, especially with regard to its military plans.??
Though the Bill Clinton administration was somewhat agreeable to the Rome process in principle, the Bush administration, hell bent on launching the neoconservative-scripted wars on nations, was totally opposed to the idea of setting up an international court to try war crimes. The Congress hurriedly passed the American Service-Members? Protection Act to undermine the universal jurisdiction of the ICC.? Washington also began signing bilateral agreements with other nations, preventing them from taking American soldiers to the ICC or trying them for war crimes in domestic courts.??
Even before the 9/11, the US had not been a great respecter of international humanitarian laws or world court judgments. Should we remind ourselves of the US atomic bomb attacks on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the use of Agent Orange chemical weapons in Viet Nam and the use of cancer-causing depleted uranium in Fallujah, Iraq?? In 1984, the US refused to obey an International Court of Justice (ICJ) ruling which found Washington guilty of placing sea mines in Nicaragua?s waters.? Then in 2003, it invaded Iraq in what was later described by the then United Nations General Secretary Kofi Annan as an illegal war.??
On the one hand, alarmed by what it sees as China?s aggressive behaviour or assertive diplomacy with regard to disputed islands in the South China Sea, the US calls for a ruled-based word order.? But on the other hand, feeling no compunction, it flouts international norms and shakes the foundation of international law, painstakingly wrought through decades or centuries by nations which wished to solve disputes through diplomacy rather than bloodshed.? Such double standards indicate that rules are only for less powerful nations, while big powers can do whatever they think is right or wrong to further their national interests.??
Some may justify such duplicity as part of power politics.? But they need to realise that it will only lead to an anarchical global order, where human rights violations and war crimes will be non-issues, with Hitlerite dictators having a field day.??
While, under Trump, the US has squandered its moral right to the mantle of global leadership, China which is gradually replacing the US as the number one world power, is not interested in promoting human rights or democracy.? Perhaps, the only silver lining is the EU, but its outreach is limited.? Need we say more about the evolving world order? The sooner the Americans unseat Trump the better it is not only for them, but also for the rest of the world.?

Employees of a distillery belonging to a businessman involved in a major financial fraud are these days under a constant threat of being laid off at any moment, they say.
?
The businessman owning this distillery, by the way, is a buddy of a leading politico in the country.
The management had been holding the sword of service termination over the neck of the employees ever since the excise sleuths had begun making surprise raids on the distillery.
The raids had begun following complaints that they had been using tabooed artificial base materials and ingredients for producing the brews.??
The management is said to be suspecting that a section of the workforce is behind the complaints to the authorities that had led to frequent raids on the distillery.?

Treating excessive vaginal bleeding
	
?
In this week?s Health Capsule we take a closer look at vaginal bleeding.?
To give more information about the subject to our readers we spoke to Dr. Wasantha Jayalath who is a Specialist in Gynecology and Obstetrics and serves at the Teaching Hospital in Gampola.??
This condition can be described as vaginal bleeding which is excessive, unusual or irregular, compared to normal menstrual bleeding. Even a newly-born girl might bleed from the vagina, but this is rare. This is due to a sudden stoppage in maternal hormones acting on a baby girl?s uterus. This condition gradually subsides without treatment.? ?
If vaginal bleeding occurs in infants, it could be due to a tear or a leach bite or a foreign body inserted into the vaginal (by herself or by accident if it is a foreign body) passage. In such instances there usually is a smelly vaginal discharge after sometime.??
Before puberty (breast development, hair growth in groin and armpits) if there is vaginal bleeding, it is undoubtedly due to an injury or bite or some other?s blood or red-coloured stain that has come on the underwear. Without breast development and hair growth in the armpits and groin, the first menstruation or menarche is unlikely to occur.??
It is not uncommonto see menstruation being irregular after menarche. This is almost always due to hormonal irregularities. This condition usually subdues after maturity of the body at around age 20. In the case of troublesome menstruation, hormonal treatment can be stared for a few months.? It is important to suspect pregnancy-related causes in the case of irregular bleeding after marriage even if you are using contraception. Therefore a pregnancy test is a must before other medications or treatments.??
Hormonal contraceptives are also the cause of irregular menstrual bleeding. The Depo-Provera injection is well-known for this. Long cycles (cycles recurring after 6 weeks or more) or menstruation once in three-four months is a treatable condition and should be tested.? ?
Polyps in uterine cavity or cervix may cause unusual bleeding. After intercourse, if there is bleeding, cervical polyp should be excluded. When abnormal bleeding occurs after 40 years, endometrial malignancy (uterine cancer) should be excluded. But the commoner causes are hormonal irregularities, contraceptives, pregnancy-related problems and polyps. Uterine and cervical cancers are rare causes for this condition.??
But in the case of abnormal bleeding after menopause (cessation of menstruation) the possibility of a cancer is somewhat high. Therefore it is mandatory to take a sample of the inner layer of uterine cavity and examine that under a microscope. But the commonest cause for this condition in women of that age is estrogen deficiency. This must be treated using the estrogen hormone which reduces some other symptoms such as hot flushes (feeling hot flushing of skin frequently) poor sleep, pain during intercourse or loss of sexual desire, loss of memory and increased anger.? ?

?We can?t be complacent about  disaster management? - Dilanthi Amaratunga
	
?
I recently read in the news that some of the early warning towers had been vandalised in Mullaitivu. What would have happened to the people who are relying on that particular early warning tower if a disaster was to take place, on that day
?
Economic losses caused by disasters are increasing
	Private sector?s involvement is vital in disaster risk reduction
	Need to be rid of the silo mentality
	Policy makers brush aside science and research
	Disaster Risk Reduction must be incorporated into development
	Appreciate the commitment made by the Government
?
Dilanthi Amaratunga is a Professor of Disaster Risk Management at the University of Huddersfield, United Kingdom with 27 years of experience in the?
higher education sector. She is a leading expert in disaster resilience, currently leading the Global Disaster Resilience Centre, a global leader in interdisciplinary research, education and advocacy to improve the resilience of countries and communities. Her work recognises that with the growing population and more extensive and interconnected environments, the world?s exposure to hazards is increasing. In a recent interview done with The ,?Dailymirror Prof. Amaratunga discussed challenges, opportunities and concerns related to disaster management in?Sri Lanka.? ?Excerpts:? ?
Q Many global disaster risk reduction campaigns emphasise on the need for immediate action in disaster preparation. Why is this need urgent?
The urban population is increasing at a rapid pace. In Sri Lanka the rural population is still higher, but the urban population is increasing. Globally too, urban populations have risen in numbers and this is quite an alarming trend. On the other hand we have mega cities developing. Even in Sri Lanka people are now migrating to cities in search of economic opportunities. This is actually quite a scary situation as a highly populated city is a recipe for disaster.?
Putting these facts in perspective, natural hazards don?t actually kill people, but most of the time, buildings do. When natural hazards interact with other elements, then disaster occurs. This is the difference between a hazard and a disaster.? ?
Disasters play a key role in every sector of the economy. Hazards can actually wipe away quite a number of systems which have been in place. Because of the very good early warning systems in place, the number of people affected by disasters is decreasing; which is a very good sign. Having said that, the economic losses caused by disasters are increasing. Saving lives of course is the most important aspect, but these economic losses cannot be ignored either. Disasters are capable of exposing people to poverty and making them experience other difficulties. That is why I believe that the time to take action is now.? ?
?
Q How important is disaster risk reduction in order to minimise economic losses?
There is no way that we can prevent natural disasters. The only thing we can do is to be prepared in order to face a disaster situation and make sure that losses are minimal. There?s no science there and anyone should be able to understand this. People need to understand that preparedness is the key. They need to be aware of how best to face a disaster and how to act once it takes place.? ?
In Sri Lanka there is quite a number of small businesses operating. How they would cope after a disaster is an issue which has not really been addressed. This is where the private sector?s involvement is vital. I really don?t see any sort of engagement with the small businesses in Sri Lanka. I also don?t see how they can cope with the aftermath of a disaster. Small businesses especially need the continuity of businesses as it is their lifeline.?
?
Q What is your opinion of the mechanisms put in place by the Government in terms of disaster management?
The issue in Sri Lanka is that it doesn?t treat the subject of disaster management as a multi-stakeholder discipline. Even the public is of the opinion that disaster management is the Government?s responsibility. Of course the state has a major role to play, but it should also be able to bring all stakeholders together.? ?
The Government has recognised the importance of Disaster Risk Reduction and I see this as a very positive move. They have set up the Disaster Management Act, which is headed by the President and the National Disaster Council. The President also graced the launch of the Association of Disaster Risk Management Professionals (ADRiMP), which I believe is encouraging. In that sense I think Sri Lanka has recognised the importance of this field. Certainly there?s lot more to do, but there are some countries in the world where even this recognition does not exist.? ?
?
Q What are the shortcomings you have observed in Sri Lanka?
One of the major issues I have observed is that people are working in absolute silos. The Government, the Disaster Management Centre (DMC), the Meteorological Department they all work as individual entities. We?re currently engaged in a project bringing in the Met and the DMC together. For the first time they have sat around a table to discuss this particular subject. In Sri Lanka I think people are very much used to working in silos. Be it academia or research, there is no space for discussion. That is why they wanted to promote disciplinary approaches through the launch of ADRiMP. I?m not saying that we need to do blue sky research (research without a clear goal) because we need to be adding to the knowledge. But there are certain areas of research that add direct value to the beneficiaries or the rest of the stakeholders.? ?
Similarly, policy makers always brush aside the science and the research. Instead they consult Wikipedia to find out what is happening. Whatever their policies are, they are not based on the actual science or the latest development. That is why I believe, if it functions properly ADRiMP will have a very important role to play, because it will be independent and will be able to facilitate a platform where people can work collaboratively.? ?
?
Q Can you name some areas which needs improvement?
The Government has been funding and supporting the Disaster Management Ministry as well as finding resources for the DMC. The investment in these areas has been very visible. But whether these resources have been used properly remains to be seen. I think it is caused by a lack of coordination between different stakeholders. It is imperative that the public must be included as a stakeholder. I don?t know what sort of role the public are expected to play in Sri Lanka.? ?
The state, policy makers, researchers, local Government, private sector and the public need to come together. I believe ADRiMP provides this opportunity.? ?
?
Q How do you view Disaster Risk Reduction in relation to development efforts in Sri Lanka?
In Sri Lanka, with the construction boom, it is very scary to think about whether they have all the ways of incorporating DRR into their processes. That is why mainstreaming disaster elements into every sector of the economy is very important, but I don?t know if there is a mechanism as such in practice. It would be very interesting to find out what mechanisms are involved.? ?
?
Q In you view, how can disaster awareness and education be mainstreamed?
Education has an integral part to play in disaster management. In the UK, there are elements of disaster management in the curriculum. Japan is a classic example where children are well informed about disasters. But are we in Sri Lanka knowledgeable to that extent? Or are we just getting kids to run behind the grade 5 scholarships?? ?
We need to start this education at the smallest level, in order to raise awareness. Therefore mainstreaming disaster awareness at every level of the society is imperative, which is the only way the general public will take it seriously. Of course when something goes wrong, the people are very good at passing the blame on somebody. What people need to realise is that everybody has a role to play.?
?
Q How prepared do you think we are as a country for a major disaster?
For Sri Lanka, like many other South Asian countries, the eyeopener was the 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami. Prior to this catastrophic we weren?t actually familiar with mega disasters. Soon afterwards there was a great volume of investment made in the name of Tsunami preparations which happened at a good scale at the time.?
However, now the world is beginning to focus on a multi-hazard approach in?managing disasters.? ?
None of the countries can invest on systems for individual hazards as it is very expensive. Therefore the concept of multi hazard preparation has been developed. However I?m not aware of the strategies developed in Sri Lanka as far as the multi hazard concept is concerned or whether we are still dealing with individual hazards.? ?
?
Similarly, policy makers always brush aside the science and the research. Instead they consult Wikipedia to find out what is happening
?
Even though hazards cannot be prevented, we can always prepare for them and minimise adverse effects by communicating it to the general public. The ordinary person needs to know what to do, where to go and what immediate steps they should be taking. This is a primary responsibility of policy makers.? ?
?
Q What is your opinion on the country?s preparedness in the event of a Tsunami?
The Tsunami early warning front has been quite good in the past. I was here as an international observer for the International Tsunami drill on September 5. The drill is conducted in order to test the system. Tsunami wise, therefore Sri Lanka has some form of preparation. On other fronts, particularly in disaster continuity, there?s a lot to be desired.? ?
With the construction boom in Sri Lanka, we sincerely hope there will be no earthquakes or any other form of disaster. After the Indian Ocean Tsunami the entire earth has moved by so many centimetres, which is actually a significant change in terms of geology. Since then, there have been several Tsunamis. This is why we cannot disregard the possibility of yet another Tsunami. We need to be prepared especially because of all the changes happening around us such as the extreme changes in temperature and melting of glaciers. All these things are interlinked.? ?
?
Q Do you think there is room for improvement in terms of technological capacity and expertise in Sri Lanka?
We absolutely can?t be complacent in disaster management. You can never know enough and this attitude is particularly a Sri Lankan problem. We need to be constantly updated with our knowledge.? ?
There needs to be a 100% change of attitude. Why does UNESCO spend millions of money annually training people from all around the world, if it is a futile exercise? I?m one of the professionals of the Indian Ocean Early Warning system training team. If everything is in order there really wouldn?t have been a need to invest billions of dollars in training. This is done because there are changes we need to adapt at any given time. We can never be complacent because we have a very good system in place. The system is only the operational side of it. If the system is not based on the latest findings, then what?s the point of having a system?? ?
I recently read in the news that some of the early warning towers had been vandalised in Mullaitivu. What would have happened to the people who are relying on that particular early warning tower if a disaster was to take place, on that day? Having a system in place is futile if it is not constantly tested. We need to evaluate if the system reflects whatever the latest findings coming in from other directions. Of course, Sri Lanka is still a developing economy and it does not possess the infrastructure nor the capacity like India and Jakarta. But we need to make sure that there is a really good downstream mechanism to pass on the information and to take action on the various levels of warnings.? ?
?
Q What is Sri Lanka?s position in terms of climate change adaptation?
People should know that climate change will have direct and indirect impacts. Direct impacts are quite visible in the form of droughts, floods and changes in seasons. In the past Sri Lanka had been a very prosperous country and we had a really good balance of the sun and the rain. But we are losing that balance now.? ?
What they can?t see and need to be aware of are the things happening elsewhere in the world which can have an impact on Sri Lanka. This is why the public should not be complacent about things. For instance people cannot pacify themselves into thinking that there won?t be another Tsunami in their lifetime. That is a very?
dangerous assumption.? ?
Recently in Indonesia there were two major earthquakes and due to their preparation, they were able to save a great number of lives. If they weren?t prepared I?m sure the number of deaths would have been more. Northern Pakistan for example is full of glaciers. Because of increased temperatures, they have started to melt. Experts have warned that it is a Tsunami in the making because the ocean will not cope. If their predictions are proven true, Sri Lanka is vulnerable to a major impact. Rising sea levels are other areas we really need to focus on. We need to be prepared and vigilant and cannot afford to be complacent about any type of disaster.? ?
?
Q What are the opportunities and challenges you see for Sri Lanka?
I need to admire the commitment of the leadership irrespective of which party they represent. The country as a whole is completely committed and is a signatory to the?Sendai framework.? ?
There is also fairly a decent research base on the subject matter while new courses are introduced at the Colombo and Peradeniya Universities. There?s a lot of building going on in the country and believe that some are very good opportunities.? ?
In terms of challenges, the silo needs to be rid of and public engagement is key. I have observed that the academia is reluctant probably due to a lack of trust. They work in isolation. The practitioners think the researchers don?t share information; therefore the mistrust needs to be cleared. These two groups need to come together which is a very big challenge.? ?

We lost faith in Police, IGP: JO
	
The Joint Opposition (JO) yesterday said that it would not involve in any Police proceeding hereafter because of the alleged conspiracy to kill President Maithripala Sirisena and former Defence Secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa with the involvement of some top Police officials.
JO MP Mahindananda Aluthgamage told a news conference at the ?Dooshana Virodhi Balakaya? on Wednesday revealed that DIG in-charge of the Terrorism Investigation Division (TID) Nalaka de Silva was in an attempt to conspire against President Sirisena and Gotabhaya Rajapaksa.
He said President Sirisena should conduct an investigation into this matter and added that immediate legal action should be taken against DIG Silva.
He said some underworld figures had also been involved in the said conspiracy and added the JO had lost its faith in the Police followed by this revelation.
?It is revealed that the Inspector General of Police (IGP) was also involved in this conspiracy. We cannot trust the Police as well as the IGP because of this issue. Therefore, we will not involve in any Police proceeding and we will not go to the Police over any matter. We will only go to the Courts if there is any issue,? he said.
?These conspirators are in an attempt to favour Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe. We thought that only the Rajapaksas have become victims but at present President Sirisena?s life is also at stake,? he added. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)

## Title: What you should know about a stroke

What you should know about a stroke
	
?
We are constantly entangled in our busy lifestyles that we often forget to have some time for ourselves. Indulging in a healthy meal, taking some time off to warm up your body or to relax your mind have become challenging tasks. In fact, we don?t bother about these lifestyle goals at all. As a result, people may develop unhealthy habits such as drinking or smoking. But have you ever thought what would happen if you are paralysed all of a sudden? Or what if you lose your consciousness? As these are potential signs of an upcoming stroke, it is always better to know what you or those around you should be doing next.? ?
With that in mind the Health Capsule spoke to Dr. Padma Gunaratne, President of the Sri Lanka Association of Geriatric Medicine to find out the causes, symptoms, diagnosis and treatments administered in the event of a stroke.? ?
?
What is a stroke?
A stroke falls into the category of a non-communicable disease and it could happen due to our lifestyles or it could be inherited. In 80% of the cases, a stroke occurs when the blood supply to the brain is impaired. Blood vessels could get blocked due to atherosclerosis thus reducing the elasticity of the walls. This builds up a pressure within the blood vessel damaging its inner walls. Hence a blood clot forms and would block the blood vessel or it would block a blood vessel in a different area. Due to this blockage, a blood vessel has a tendency to burst.??
?
These lifestyle-related factors could in turn contribute to obesity and other conditions such as diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol which could increase a person?s vulnerability to develop heart diseases or a stroke
Causes?
According to Dr. Padma Gunaratne one cause of developing a stroke is due to ageing. ?In 30% of the cases, strokes occur in people less than 60 years of age. Hence it could be prevented if adequate precautions are taken. In this case there are modifiable and non-modifiable factors contributing to the development of a stroke. Modifiable factors could fall into two categories; lifestyle and disease-related.? Lifestyle factors include : Unhealthy diet, lack of exercise, smoking and the excessive intake of alcohol.? ?
?These lifestyle-related factors could in turn contribute to obesity and other conditions such as diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol which could increase a person?s vulnerability to develop heart diseases or a stroke. Non-modifiable factors include genetics and hereditary characteristics. Heart diseases also increase the risk of developing a stroke. In addition to that if your heart vials are affected for example due to rheumatic fever, the heart vials will be damaged and will develop clots. This in turn would also lead to a stroke. If one experiences a rhythm problem there is a possibility to develop a stroke at a young age,? she added.??
?
Symptoms?
Dr. Gunaratne further said that at the onset of a stroke there are few prominent symptoms which a patient has to be aware of. These include :??
Partial paralysis of the body which could include the legs, face or arms.? ?
	Loss of speech ? Here a person may say the wrong words as the speech area of the brain becomes dysfunctional? ?
	Inability to communicate ? One may speak to the patient, but the patient may not be able to respond to what you say. But if you show a gesture to the patient, he or she may respond. This is also known as Receptive/Expressive Dysphasia.? ?
	Loss of vision ? a patient would appear normal, but he or she may lose vision in one eye. Therefore the patient will only see half of your face. This condition is also known as Hemianopia.? ?
	Severe vertigo, difficulty in swallowing and walking ? These conditions could occur if blood circulation is blocked.??
	Severe headache and loss of consciousness ? These symptoms would occur if severe bleeding has taken place within the brain and sometimes one may not regain consciousness.? ?
?
Prevention
Prevention could be primary and secondary. If one develops a stroke they should; stop smoking, reduce the alcohol intake, have a healthy diet and increase consumption of vegetables and fruits. They can also do the following-? ?
Exercise which includes walking for at least half an hour a day if he or she doesn?t get adequate exercise from their day-to-day work? ?
	Check for blood sugar and diabetes and keep those conditions under control if you are between 30-45 years of age? ?
	Take medicine to control these conditions? ?
	Take precautions if you have a history of heart diseases or a stroke? ?
After a person develops a stroke, both the patient and those around him or her are usually aware of how things should be done. In terms of secondary prevention the following could be done :??
People can identify if the person is having a stroke? ?
	Take him to the hospital immediately? ?
	Be aware of neurological rapid onset characteristics? ?
	Continue the intake of prescribed medicine??
	Young people should avoid taking contraceptive pills and hormone tablets which would increase the risk of developing a stroke? ?
	If you have multiple risk factors, the risk also multiplies? ?
Speaking further, Dr. Gunaratne said that a person could be doing anything at the onset of a stroke. ?In most instances they would say that they were alright until they realised that half of their body got paralysed. It happens suddenly and therefore you may not have much time to react. After the stroke the physician would after informing the patient investigate as to how the symptoms developed thereby keeping a record of the patient for future reference.???
?
Diagnosis and treatment?
She further said that studies have shown that one in 100 people in Colombo and suburbs have suffered a stroke. ?Anybody should be able to recognise a stroke based on the previously mentioned symptoms. In fact these symptoms arise all of a sudden. Usually we ask the patient what he or she was doing before the stroke occurred, the time it occurred etc. During a heart attack, the blood vessels that supply blood to the heart get blocked whereas in the case of a stroke, the blood vessels supplying blood to the brain get blocked. Hence we do a CT scan to see if they have bled into the brain. It is important to take a patient to the nearest hospital equipped with these facilities in order to prevent the chances of developing a second attack since the risk is high.??
?If internal bleeding has occurred, there will be a different treatment. But if blood vessels are blocked thrombolysis is conducted within four and a half hours to diffuse the blood clot. In order to experience maximum benefits, it should be given as early as possible. Once a patient is bedridden, he or she needs to be taken care of. If not such patients are exposed to the risk of developing other conditions such as pneumonia, bed sores and may even be dehydrated as they cannot swallow anything. Hence the management of patients is done by a team of experts including the doctor, nurse, physiotherapist, occupational therapist, speech and language therapist, a counsellor and a social service officer.? ? ?

Why didn't MR oppose ETCA and Mattala PPP deal in India: UNP
	
The UNP yesterday questioned as to whether former President Mahinda Rajapaksa opposed the proposed Economic and Technological Cooperation Agreement (ETCA) and the Public Private Partnership deal with regard to the Mattala Airport during his visit to India in the same way he opposed them in Sri Lanka
UNP MP Harshana Rajakaruna told a media briefing that it was funny not to hear reports which said the former President had opposed the proposed deals which the Sri Lankan government is planning to get into with India when he met the Indian Prime Minister on Wednesday. ?We have seen the former President opposing the proposed deals with Indian whenever he is in Sri Lanka. However we did not see such a behavior from him when he visits India,? MP. Rajakaruna said.
?Mr. Rajapaksa had actually stated he had not discussed the Mattala Airport deal when he met the Indian Prime Minister but had only said that he has an issue with the privatization programme of Maithripala Sirisena's government. Why has he not opposed the deal the way he does in Sri Lanka? Why did not he express his objection on the deal when he met Prime Minister Modi?? Mr. Rajakaruna questioned.
UNP MP Thushara Indunil Amarasena who also participated in the news conference said MP Wimal Weerawansa should ask the people to hoist black flags to oppose the former President?s meeting with the Indian Prime Minister. ? Mr. Weerasana asked the people to hoist black flags when Prime Minister Modi was visiting Sri Lanka for the International Vesak festival. He should ask the people to do the same when former President returns to the island after meeting the Indian Prime Minister,? he said.
Both MPs said former President should have opposed the proposed deals between the Indian and the Sri Lankan government if they were genuinely opposing them.
The MPs also responded to the statement made by the former President that one of his brothers will contest for the presidential elections next year questioning as to whether there is no one else to contest for the post other than the Rajapaksas. They also said Mr. Rajapaksa should mention as to which brother of his is going to get the candidature at the next presidential election. (Yohan Perera)
