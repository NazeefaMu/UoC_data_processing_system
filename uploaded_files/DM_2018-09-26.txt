A coming event casting its shadow
	

A senior Blue, this politico has been looked on over the years as the partys Number One in Uva. In fact, the countrys Number Two position had been almost within his reach on many occasions though it had eluded him so far to his obvious disappointment.

His current boss, incidentally a one who had stolen a march over him under fortuitous circumstances, in a bid to stage a comeback, has launched a holistic development programme covering the entire country expecting his loyalists in the party to put their best foot forward in implementing it at the grassroots level. Meanwhile, the other Yahapalanaya partner too has launched a similar programme with the similar objective.
However, our Uva heavyweight, a true Blue from the very outset, is reportedly carrying out the activity planned under the Green party led- programme with heart and soul completely ignoring the Blue programme, they say.
Meanwhile, he is reportedly openly soliciting the support of his Blue party activists in the district for the Green party programme telling them that they could depend on the Green leader to help develop their villages.
The Number One, who had heard about the change come over their Uva Lokka, had remarked that they could now write him off as a goner!

A prospect that brings him happy tears!
	

Theres a top team member hailing from the deep South whom you can still call young and in fact, he is said to be set for a second marriage.

He is reportedly walking on air these days. Confiding the secret of his unusual happy mood in some intimates he has said:
People in my area visiting me these days make it a point to inquire from me as to when I am supposed to take oaths in my new high office and shower their blessings on me. So, I cant help happy tears springing into my eyes!
Although this politico is having high hopes of being elevated to Number Two position one of these days, there are three to four others too nursing the same ambition, they say.
In fact, Number One had occasion to mention some names himself when once the question as to who was good enough for the coveted post had arisen. The post, by the way, seems to be up for grabs these days.

A saga about two projects placed on the backburner!
	

A saga about how two political characters from the South had tried to strike gold from the proposed Gin and Nilwala River Projects is coming out bit by bit these days, they say.

A white-collar advisor in his sunset years too had been involved in this gold-strike bid.
It was the Number One who first came out with a hint of the gold-strike bid and now an audio clip containing a tell-tale conversation has been recovered, they say.
The gold-strike bid had stalled when the two politicos from the South had planned to share the pay dirt between themselves giving no chance to the purohita, handling the subject to cut in on the deal.
The cold war over the sharing of pay dirt had led to pigeonholing the Gin Ganga and Nilwala Ganga Projects proposal placed at the top table months ago and a large section of the peasantry in the South suffering due to long drought spells, targeted to benefit from the two projects is now condemned to a much longer wait for a steady supply of water for irrigation and drinking purposes for no fault of theirs, they say.

Afghanistan, India nail-biter ends in tie
	
A brilliant all-round effort helped the spirited Afghanistan cricketers to tie their last Super Four dead rubber against India played at the Dubai International Cricket Stadium in UAE yesterday.
Afghanistan who had earlier beaten Sri Lanka and Bangladesh in their first-round match, however are out of a Fridays final, having lost their first two Super Four matches to Bangladesh and Pakistan, but shocked the mighty Indians who were at one point racing to victory.
India needed 7 runs off the final over bowled by Rashid Khan with one wicket in hand but having put on the hard yards, Ravindra Jadeja hit the penultimate ball to the mid-wicket fielder erupting wild celebrations in the middle.
Chasing 253 to win, the second string Indian team, captained by M. S. Dhoni for the 200th time suffered a middle-order collapsed that saw them crashing to 166 for four after a century opening stand between Ambati Rayudu and K. L. Rahul by the 31st over.
Indian openers Rahul (60) and Rayudu (57) laid a solid stand of 110 to put the Afghans under tremendous pressure but both departed in quick succession, followed by the wickets of Dhoni (8) and Manish Pandey (8).
Both Rahul and Rayudu dominated the strong Afghan bowling attack early on before Mohmmad Nabi dismissed Rayudu for 57 off 49 balls ending the threatening stand.
He clobbered four boundaries and four sixes while Raul who made 60 before he was trapped leg-before by Rashid Khan.
Dinesh Karthik (44) and Kuldeep Yadav (19) put on 38 for the fifth wicket but both departed with India still needing 47 runs off the last 10 overs.
Deepak Chahar was cleaned up by seamer Aftab Alam to claim his second wicket to drag it to the wire.
Alam returned figures of two for 53 Rashid Khan two for 41 and Mohammad Nabi had two for 40.
India who had already qualified for Fridays final made five changes to the playing XI to test their bench strength.
Skipper Rohit Sharma and Shikhar Dhawan sat out along with bowlers, Yuzvendra Chahal, Bhuvneshwar Kumar and Jasprit Bumrah.
The star of the evening, however was the burley Afghan opener Mohammed Shahzad who lit up the dead Super Four rubber with a scintillating batting effort to take Afghanistan to 252 for the loss of eight wickets.
The wicket-keeper batsman who reached his fifth international hundred and second against an ICC Full Member with a flick to the fine-leg boundary, hit a flurry of sixes and boundaries in his quick-fire innings of 124 that saw the men from the landlocked country setting a formidable target against the most consistent side of this years Asia Cup.

While the rest of the batsmen struggled against the Indian attack, Shahzad seems to be batting on a different track as he dominated the bowling hammering 11 fours and seven boundaries in his 117 ball knock.
He shared 65 for the opening wicket with Javed Ahmadi, but the latter managed just five runs off 30 deliveries, playing second fiddle to marauding Shahzad who was on a roll.
Afghans middle-order could not provide the support expected as wickets fell cheaply until Mohammad Nabi joined at the fall of Gulbadin Naib when the score was on 132 for five. 
But by then Shahzad has scored his century, entertaining the crowd with some brilliant power hitting. When Shahzad finally holed out to the long off-fielder ending his high-octane innings, he had scored 124 of the teams score of 180 by the 38th over. 
Later, Mohammad Nabi hit brisk knock of 64 off 56 with four sixes and three boundaries to ensure that Afghanistan put up a competitive total.(Champika Fernando reporting from Dubai)

The dialogues attempt to touch upon governance, writing in the digital era, science fiction, short films as well as an opportunity for debut writers.
Short Story Competition
A short story competition in all three language  English, Sinhala and Tamil - is being conducted parallel to the literary festival where writers can submit their pieces under the two age categories of 13-18 years and 18 years & above.

The Indian High Commission in Colombo on Wednesday said the Indian national, who had been arrested in Sri Lanka over the alleged assassination attempt of President Maithripala Sirisena, his predecessor Mahinda Rajapaksa and family members has had a history of mental disturbance since 2000.
A Spokesperson of the High Commission said they had seen media reports that an Indian national, claiming to have information about the threat to lives of prominent Sri Lankan leaders, had been detained by Sri Lankan Police.

A senior top team member had the other day summoned the district level high-ups of a leading State-Owned Financial Institution for a conference held to discuss a Ministry project. This political authority hailing from a remote area in the country also holds a top post in the Green Party.

On the very day of the conference, the head of the financial institution had tried to contact over the phone a district high-up for an urgent matter.
Finding the high-up missing from the office, the institution head had inquired about the cause for his absence and learnt that he was attending a Ministry conference in Colombo.
Livid that his district-level subordinates had attended a conference summoned by a Ministry sans his permission, the institution head had asked them to show cause, why disciplinary action should not be taken against them for deserting their posts, they say.

## Title: Did Janabalaya Protest Fail

Did Janabalaya Protest Fail
	
By Rohana R Wasala
The Janabalaya Kolambata held in Colombo by the Joint Opposition (JO) on September 05, 2018 was a roaring success. It was, of course, a foregone conclusion. That it was going to draw huge crowds was clear to all. Through their well attended and meticulously organized demonstration the JO made a direct hit on the government. By trying to forestall it, then to obstruct its progress, and finally to belittle the astounding success that the Janabalaya achieved as a daringly defiant show of people power against all odds, the Yahapalanaya worthies and their cronies have only succeeded in demonstrating their own intransigence against the public will. They have thus scored an own goal in favour of the JO, an instance of poetic justice indeed, in the circumstances! That is locally. Will the deafening roar of protest be echoed in Geneva, where it matters most
To any fair-minded Sri Lankan whose vision is not clouded by racist hatred, personal prejudice and vain arrogance, the Janabalaya protest was the loudest outcry to date against an incumbent government in post-independence Sri Lanka. What the Janabalaya (Peoples Power Demonstration) achieved was that through it the common people gave the government a severe warning that they were fed up with it. They did this in the hearing of the whole world and expressed their earnest desire and their urgent demand for a democratic change. This is a cry that NO government that abides by, or is morally and legally bound to abide by, democratic norms could turn a deaf ear to.
Opponents of the Joint Opposition (JO) deliberately misinterpret the message of the People Power March of September 5. But the reality that the demonstrators experienced at firsthand in Colombo and that we watched on TV and CP screens across the world is in stark contrast to their devaluing assessment. Their farfetched misrepresentation of what actually happened is not of any significance, though, because the whole kit and caboodle who engineered the change of 2015 are now being blamed for it; and the honest few among them who were duped to join in, now suffer from bouts of self-blame. On the other hand, there is enough unmistakable evidence that the impact of the Janabalaya Kolambata March and Rally has already been felt both within and outside Sri Lanka. A couple of days ago, former president Mahinda Rajapaksa was invited by India and given a reception that, as some in the media said, is normally accorded to a visiting head of state (whether the Indian gesture indicates a positive attitudinal change in respect of Sri Lanka is yet to be seen, though); at the Atakalanpanna Multipurpose Cooperative Society elections, all of the 210 seats have been won by the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP), with the UNP and the SLFP having won no seats at all. An independent Sinhala language website had a headline which declared Jala Bala Virodhaya Asarthakai (Water Force Resistance Fails). This was a sarcastic reference to the governments alleged failed attempt, as the organizers were quick to charge, to demoralize the Janabalaya demonstrators and to create public misgivings about the bona fides of their declared peaceful intentions, through a massive display of police presence equipped with a fleet of water cannons, and batons and riot shields that suggested that the authorities anticipated violence. The IGP had previously warned that in the event of any violence occurring, he was going to use not minimum force, but required force!
The protest marchers came from every corner of the island: from Jaffna in the north, from Devundara (Devinuwara), Matara, in the south, from Trincomalee and Baticaloa in the east, and converged in Colombo with others from the western province. People from every community, needless to say, thoroughly disappointed with the present state of affairs, participated in the Janabalaya. A large crowd of Sri Lankan expatriates working abroad, intellectuals, professionals and entrepreneurs from Viyathmaga, retired army generals and other veterans of the military (people who normally do not take part in such public demonstrations) were also reported to be taking part in it. So the marchers were not kasippu (bootleg) guzzling tramps as some opponents of the demonstration wanted us to believe. It must be appreciated that those who sought to scuttle it did everything in their power to make the task extremely challenging for the organizers, and for the two hundred thousand who were said to take part in the demonstration. The participants in the events showed the highest level of discipline and restraint in the face of the active hostility of the spoilers who lacked those qualities. (Some detractors in the media falsely and insultingly claimed that the demonstrators good behavior was due to the massive presence of riot police!)

What the Janabalaya (Peoples Power Demonstration) achieved was that through it the common people gave the government a severe warning that they were fed up with it. They did this in the hearing of the whole world and expressed their earnest desire and their urgent demand for a democratic change

The JOs original date for the protest march and rally was August 17, 2018, which was the third anniversary of the present government. However, considering the fact that it could potentially disrupt the movement of students sitting for the GCE (AL) examination due to be ongoing around that date, the organizers changed it to September 5. The massive Janabalaya was organized by the youth wing of the SLPP, led by MP Namal Rajapaksa, former presidents son. As a precaution against possible legal obstructions that could be imposed on the peaceful nonviolent demonstrators, the organizers kept the routes of the march and the venue of the rally and sit-in protest under wraps until the morning of September 5. The marchers were just asked to descend on Colombo from all quarters. Eventually, the protesters marched along five routes in the city (Kandy, Baseline, Negombo, Maligawatte and Town Hall roads) and congregated at the Lake House Roundabout where they held a satyagraha (a non-violent protest based on truth, demanding justice) . 
Some incredibly anti-people, anti-social strategies were employed in turn to stop it beforehand, to obstruct it while it was in progress, and to declare the mass protest a failure after it ended. The police were used in several places to try to move court to take out bans on the protests on spurious grounds, but the strategy failed, showing that the judges are not for bending the law for serving the political whims of those in power. To harass protesters, the Road Passenger Transport Authority in various provinces ordered private bus services not to accept private tours during the days that they were expected to travel to and from Colombo (September 3 to 7). Several participants were physically attacked while on the peaceful march. At Nittambuwa a trench was dug under some false pretext using Road Development Authority (RDA) workers, which inconvenienced thousands of normal commuters as well as the marchers, MP Udaya Gammanpila said at a post event news briefing. He also claimed that several young men who were decorating a stage in the city on the night of September 4th, were assaulted by an unidentified gang and were hospitalized; a bus carrying demonstrators to Colombo was intercepted at Hali-Ela in the Badulla area and was attacked by hooligans, inflicting grievous injuries on the commuters, and smashing up the bus beyond repair, Gammanpila said. There was also the case of alleged distribution of poisoned or contaminated milk sachets among the protestors on the march. Media reported that action was instituted at a court in Matara by an individual who was affected by this wicked deed. On September 20th The Islands lead headline was Alleged bid to poison JO supporters  Milco admits its milk was spiked. The news report said: Milco Chairman A.C.M. Zuflikar Cader, yesterday, told a group of Joint Opposition members that a needle had been used to introduce something into the packets of milk, distributed among those participating at Jana Balaya Colombata protest, on Sept 5.
Vain attempts to disparage the Janabalaya demonstration are a part of the third or the postmortem phase of the harassment of the public of the country for trying to exercise their right to freedom of expression, the most important form of freedom in a democracy. This writer deems it a national responsibility he owes to his Motherland as a journalist not to stand by while parties that currently wield power, by means of their falsehoods and false claims, continue to feed and perpetuate the many misconceptions about her that the Tamil racist separatists (a minority among mainstream Tamils in Sri Lanka) have spread abroad including the powerful West, which are so injurious to the Sri Lankan state and people as a whole. 
The protestors who came down to Colombo, in brotherhood and humanity, from every part of the island, representing all the ethnic communities that compose the Sri Lankan population, amidst numerous difficulties, in the name of democracy, justice and freedom, demonstrated how peaceful, disciplined, non-violent, but courageous in the face of adversity they are, for all the world to see. They did not come to Colombo to indulge in any fun and frolic as the government media wanted to pretend.
Democracy-loving Sri Lankans deserve better treatment in their own country and at the UNHRC, Geneva.

Embark and Lyceum get together for a brighter future between children and animals
	
A happy day it was indeed when a 31 homeless street dogs found their forever homes in the loving arms of the kind children and adults who visited Embarks Adopt A Dog Day at Lyceum International School, Nugegoda on the 15th of September. Students from grades 1 to 8 were invited to attend along with their families and friends. The organizers were delighted by the fact that all the puppies and adult dogs who had been put up for adoption found good homes and new families in record time. In fact, Embark ran out of dogs as the demand was so high, but this was just the first adoption day of many more to come at the Lyceum Schools, so everyone who missed out can find their forever friends at future adoption days.
Adoption is the best means to stand against puppy mills and factory-style breeding, which regularly puts profit before animal welfare and often leads to horrendous consequences for the animals involved. By adopting a homeless dog, one helps save a life and gains a loyal companion. Adoption provides a beautiful Sri Lankan street dog, who often has little chance of survival on the streets, with a safe and happy life.
Present at the adoption day were Mr. Mohan Lal Grero, the Founder of Lyceum, Mrs. KumariGrero, the Coordinating Principal of Lyceum, Ms. Otara Gunewardene, the Founder/Director of Embark and Ms. NardhyaGrero, the organizer of the event.
Lyceums mission to produce global citizens who will reshape the future merged with that of Embark, which is to improve the welfare of street dogs in Sri Lanka while fostering a harmonious existence between people and animals. What was witnessed between the canines and children was love and harmony in the purest form. After all, what better way to ensure a bright future for people and animals than to teach the next generation to love and care for all animals.

From meditation to Bodhi Poojas!
	

A top one tasked with maintaining law and order is reportedly taking time off his onerous duties these days to hold Bodhi poojas in a bid to ward off looming threats to his precious career.

A group of yahapalanaya Diyawanna members had quite recently slammed the top one for his queer doings and idiosyncrasies. On hearing about the fire directed at him, he had summoned his juniors both male and female and delivered a lecture as usual to vent his spleen during which he had made several obscene gestures to add effect to his harsh comments.
However, some females who attended the lecture had soon afterwards informed the higher authorities about the angry comments and the obscene gestures he had made making the situation worse for him.
Finding that jig was up, he had rushed to a prominent temple in the Kelaniya area and prayed to the deities for a way out of the impending troubles, they say.

Hundreds protest in Delhi against deaths of sewer cleaners
	

REUTERS, 25th SEPTEMER, 2018-The relatives of thousands of Indians who died cleaning sewers protested in the capital on Tuesday, aiming to stop the practice of workers entering underground conduits to unclog drains and remove waste with their bare hands.
Hundreds of protesters shouted slogans accusing the government of delaying compensation for sewer deaths, while others waved banners saying they came as Prime Minister Narendra Modi pushes his Swachh Bharat, or Clean India, programme.
About 1,800 sewers cleaners have asphyxiated to death in the last decade, says the Safai Karamchari Andolan (SKA), a group that is campaigning to eliminate the practice.
Most of the roughly 160,000 workers involved in cleaning human waste are women, it added.
In 1993, India outlawed what it calls manual scavenging, a practice that includes the barehanded cleaning of dry latrines, mostly by women and Dalits, who are at the bottom of Hinduisms social hierarchy.

Dr. Ruvaiz Haniffa is the 125th President of the Sri Lanka Medical Association (SLMA) which is the apex medical professional association of Sri Lanka. It is the oldest professional medical association in Asia and Australasia which brings together medical professionals of all grades and branches.Dr. Haniffa is a Consultant Family Physician and Head of the Family Medicine Unit of the Colombo University Medical Faculty. In an interview with Daily Mirror, Dr. Haniffa spoke about universal health coverage, loopholes in our healthcare system and various breaches of ethics. 
Excerpts:


We have an undisputed role as guardians of the academic, professional, moral and ethical affairs of the medical profession. But we are not punitive. We work through committees. We have a council elected by members. We have standing committees

Q What is the difference between the Sri Lanka Medical Association (SLMA), the Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) and the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC)
The SLMC is a statutory body established by the Health Ministry to govern the academic and professional standards, the ethical conduct of doctors and any other matter related to the profession. It is the body that licenses the practice of medicine in Sri Lanka. Hence, it is regulatory.
Then, doctors need to get together for their interests, for continuing medical education (CME) and so forth. The SLMA is one such organization open to all doctors in this country. They can be specialists, non-specialists, government doctors or in private practice or in the university. They can even be university students. Our membership is open to all medical professionals. We are an apolitical, non-trade union, professional and academic body.
Other organizations are specific. For instance, to be a member of the GMOA, you need to be working in the Health Ministry. I am from the Colombo University. Although I am in government service, I cant become a member of the GMOA because I am not attached to the Health Ministry. We have the Faculty of Medicine Teachers Association at the university. Thats a trade union which lobbies for salary hikes and profession related trade issues.
Other than trade unions, you have specialists professional bodies. If youre a surgeon, you become a member of the College of Surgeons. There are 52 such organizations in Sri Lanka. Due to increased specialization, the medical profession has fragmented. There are both good and bad things in fragmentation. We offer an umbrella for all doctors under these 52 organizations.
We have an undisputed role as guardians of the academic, professional, moral and ethical affairs of the medical profession. But we are not punitive. We work through committees. We have a council elected by members. We have standing committees. Then we have the Sri Lanka Clinical Trial Registry. Without registering with us, one cannot do a clinical trial in the country. This is recognized by the World Health Organization (WHO).
We organize a Run and Walk every year. This time, the theme was Eat Wise, Drop a Size. A lot of people are overweight and use drugs for diabetes, hypertension and similar maladies. As a practising doctor, I can say that one cannot treat ailments by taking drugs. You need to have a lifestyle modification. One way is to have the ideal weight. You need not diet but eat wise.
We also have the Annual International Congress and this years theme was Shifting focus from diseases to patients. There is no point in treating diseases. You must treat people. For instance, when treating diabetes, for many doctors it doesnt matter who has diabetes. In the long-run it does. So you need to treat the patient. He or she might have some other issue along with diabetes. If you dont take that into account, treatment wont be effective. So this is why we thought that the focus should shift from diseases to patients.
The SLMA has been around for 131 years. But the challenge is, will we be there for another 131 years if we go on like this We are at crossroads as a profession. Where are we heading to We have divided ourselves into 52 groups and each demands a separate identity. When I introduced myself, I told you that I was a family physician. I didnt say I was a doctor. I am conscious of my identity and I want to project that. This identity has started to divide us. We are fragmenting. In my profession, I can treat you, your father and even your grandfather. I am a general practitioner. But if Im an obstetrician, can I treat Mr. Perera who comes to me No, I cant. So where is medicine in medicine I am not saying its bad, but we need to get back to how we treat patients. I am an expert in family medicine, but can I care for people You cant care for people if you dont know the art of caring. We should know how to talk and conduct ourselves. We have lost dignity in the profession. We are affluent. As a doctor, you can amass a lot of wealth. But what we have lost is our dignity to care for people. Our identity should be used to unite ourselves, not to divide.
This year, the WHOs health day theme was Universal Health Coverage: Everyone, Everywhere. It is a concept where you want everyone to have access to basic healthcare. We want to promote this concept in Sri Lanka.

QSri Lanka provides basic, free healthcare. What more should be done to achieve universal health coverage
Although Sri Lanka has a free healthcare system, 40% of per capita income goes to health. So, to achieve universal healthcare, you need to give a basic, essential package of care. This will include fasting blood sugar and lipid profile. This cost will be borne by the State. The investigation cost will go down. When it comes to drugs, for instance anti-diabetes, you have to go to a big hospital. So your transportation cost will reduce when it is made available at the primary medical care unit.
We need to improve the quality of primary curative care which includes the vaccines given. When it comes to a cough or a cold, the focus is on how to treat. The key is to train doctors. The centre has to improve. You need the help of Provincial Councillors, MPs and other eminent personalities as this is a policy decision. You need that political and bureaucratic assistance.

QWhat loopholes have you observed in our healthcare system
The biggest loophole is the bypassing phenomenon. For instance, Ragama has a top-class centre. But people dont go there. They bypass that centre and come to Colombo and then the hospital is overcrowded. That has a knock-on effect. Doctors want to come to Colombo too. For instance, those who pass out from the Eastern University dont want to stay there for various reasons like having better schools for their children. This is while theyve been provided with all facilities to work in that hospital.
So, if you can stop the bypassing phenomenon and provide care at the local hospital, that would be the best for the system. There wont be a wastage of money. All resources will be utilized.
The other loophole is maldistribution of medical officers. Most of them are in big hospitals. Doctors based in outstation hospitals dont work the eight hours they are required to. Even at the Colombo OPD, you just work for two hours or so. There should be someone to monitor and look into the working hours of doctors.

QWhat breaches of ethics have you observed in the medical profession today
The biggest misunderstanding and potential cause for negligence happen because the medical officer doesnt take time to sit down and explain what is going on with the ailing patient. The doctor might know what is going on, but not share that information with the patient in a patient-centred way. So the patient goes from pillar to post trying to figure out whats going on. This lack of communication leads to a lot of ethical issues.

QWhen is a doctor liable for medical negligence
Negligence has to be proven in a court. According to medical ethics, we have to act in the interests of patients. We have to do no harm. If youre not skilled enough, you are at a high probability of inflicting harm on patients and being negligent. So number one is to have a good, skilled doctor out there. You need to have a very good regulatory training system. That is the role of the Sri Lanka Medical Council. It will have to investigate these things. This is within the profession. There are categories where the doctor is barred from practice for six months, for life or the doctor might be sent for retraining. Beyond that its a litigation issue.
The negligence can be something as easy as not being able to read and diagnose an ECG. That is being very negligent. Part of our role through the continuous medical education is to see such things dont take place. The primary interest is the public. But as a profession, we want to improve our standards to provide a better care to the public.

QThere is concern over certain doctors promoting particular pharmaceutical products in return for benefits offered by corporates. What are your thoughts on this
As a doctor, I am approached by agents of these companies. I do meet them. That is the reality. But it is up to me to see how I ethically conduct myself. We have given ethical guidelines on how to deal with the pharmaceutical industry. To be fair by the pharmaceutical industry, they too have prepared guidelines on what they can do and shouldnt do with us. But some people from both parties misuse this system. They get undue benefits from each other. This happens. So you have to prevent unethical practice by doctors and the pharmaceutical industry.

We have an undisputed role as guardians of the academic, professional, moral and ethical affairs of the medical profession. But we are not punitive. We work through committees. We have a council elected by members. We have standing committees

QWhen it comes to private practice, people claim that doctors are money-minded and that they dont spend sufficient time with patients. How does the SLMA try to assure that doctors fulfil their duties
Doctors are spread all over the country. If you really analyze the situation, overcrowding and the fact that doctors dont have time is with the busy doctor who has more patients. Why are patients going to particular doctors Because they feel they provide good care. If they think they can get that care in 10 seconds as opposed to an equally-qualified doctor who will give you 45 minutes, its a patients perception of the problem. As far as I am concerned, there are no good or bad doctors. There are doctors with equal qualifications. This is what the SLMC assures. If people consult popular or unpopular doctors, that categorization is not by the profession. It is by the public perception. So where you make the difference is probably how you talk -- the soft skills in the doctor. It is like voting for what you like.
We know that there is overcrowding and doctors are seeing patients late at night. But if there was no demand, doctors wouldnt do that. So its demand-driven because you must understand that doctors are also practising a profession. What we as an association can say is do it ethically. We can only say, but we cannot enforce.

QDo you think euthanasia should be legalized in Sri Lanka
We have a committee on palliative care -- end of life care. Currently, the end of life care does not mean euthanasia itself. Euthanasia is medically assisted termination of life. That includes a lot of medical and social issues, religious beliefs, values and so forth. Euthanasia is a western concept. I know we practise western medicine, but we do it in an Asian culture. In our opinion, we have to take the cultural factor into consideration before recommending anything. You might also ask about abortion.
QI was coming to that
Even there you find a termination of life. In such an instance, it has to be contextual -- in Sri Lanka what do we do As a profession, we can make recommendations. Again, the ultimate decision has to be made by parliamentarians who reflect the public opinion. The doctors opinion is also reflected there. We do a lot of work on end of life care. We want to improve the quality of it in Sri Lanka.

Indian national had not revealed any assassination plot: Police Spokesman
	
Police Spokesman SP Ruwan Gunasekara today said the Indian national had not revealed any assassination plot to the CID on President Maithripala Sirisena and former President Mahinda Rajapaksa but had only spoken of a threat to several individuals following the revelation by Anti Corruption Movements Director Operations Namal Kumara on assassination plot.
He told a news conference that the CID in its B-report filed in the Colombo Magistrates Court on Tuesday had not mentioned anything about an assassination plot revealed by the Indian national.
SP Gunasekara said that the Indian National Mercil Thomas had been arrested by the CID on September 21 on information received by Anti Corruption Movements Director Operations Namal Kumara.
The only thing the suspect had revealed was that he felt about a threat to several individuals after disclosing the video and audio clip of a telephone conversation by Namal Kumara at a press conference and the media reports on the incident. The suspect had said to the CID officers that he visited Namals residence to inquire about it, SP Gunasekara added.
He said the Indian national had arrived in Sri Lanka in January 2017 and added that he had stayed in several places.
However, it was yet to reveal how and from whom he received funds. CID is conducting further investigations on a detention order, he said. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

JO mulls no-confidence motion against IGP
	
A No-Confidence Motion (NCM) would be brought against IGP Pujith Jayasundera to get him removed over his alleged involvement in the alleged assassination plot on President Maithripala Sirisena and ex-President Mahinda Rajapaksa, the Joint Opposition (JO) said today.
JO Leader Dinesh Gunawardane said they had yesterday requested the Speaker to convene the Parliament next week instead of in two more weeks, to discuss the alleged assassination plot, the IGP and also the current economic affairs.
Meanwhile, MP Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena accused it was the nature of the United National Party (UNP) to assassinate leaders with the help of the Police as it could not win elections.
With the help of the Police, the UNP politicians assassinated one of its leaders in the past. It was not the LTTE that killed him. President Premadasa was about to reveal those, who was behind this assassination but he was killed on May Day. Had he revealed this plot, half of Police and political higher-ups would have been ended up in jail, he said.
He said the same set of events were taking place today and said the JO had no confidence in the investigations into IGP Pujith Jayasundera over his alleged involvement.
The IGP is parading with DIG Nalaka Silva, who is also involved in the alleged plot, all over the countryside, he said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

JVP leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake said yesterday that they would prefer the proposed 20th Amendment to the Constitution which was presented in parliament by his party was subjected to a referendum in addition to the approval of a two-thirds majority in parliament.
He told a news conference that various MPs in parliament view the 20A in different perspectives and added that it could be blocked in parliament by certain MPs on their political ideologies.
Dont block it in parliament. Let it go for a referendum so that people could decide whether they need it. We are sure that the people will approve it, he said.
He said they view passing of the 20A in a constitutional and political point of view and added that in a constitutional point of view it must be passed with two thirds in the Parliament and in a political point of view it should be approved by the people at a referendum in addition to the two thirds majority in parliament.
The Constitution should be amended according to the current Constitution. Certain clauses could be amended on a two-thirds majority. We agree with the SC ruling and go for a referendum on the 20th Amendment, he said. (Ajith Siriwardana)

Karu as candidate
	
UNP needs a dark horse-a candidate whose baggage does not carry within itself dark secrets of corruption and nepotism
A dark horse, which had never been thought of, rushed past the grandstand in sweeping triumph.~Benjamin Disraeli

In the last few columns, I have tried, maybe in vain, to make a case for a plausible scenario in which a Presidential Candidate representing the same UNP-led coalition that brought current President Maithripala Sirisena to office could be successful again.
Maithripala Sirisena, although he did not seem to be formidable as a Presidential candidate, eventually proved to be above average and an ideal mix which an unsuspecting electorate would accept.
However, the coalition Government that was formed after the electoral victories in January and August in 2015, though it has managed to survive, the breakage of the relationship between the UNP leader and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and President Sirisena who is barely holding on to the leadership of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP), seems almost finaland done.
That is a very sad ending of a once-promising political partnership that was in the making. The ideological differences alone between the United National Party (UNP) and the Sri Lanka Freedom Party are wide and vast enough and too disparate to survive in nasty and cruel political storms.

The UNP needs a fifth horseman, so to speak who will be seen as a deliverer beyond all expectations

In the meanwhile, the Rajapaksas seem to have woken up from their defeat-ridden slumber that followed the immediate aftermath of the 2015 Presidential Elections.
The sheer magnitude of power and access to the national coffers and the natural proximity to the luxuries of administrative power machinations has apparently awakened them to muster their forces for another game of national ransacking and corruption-ridden governance.
The disqualifying elements of the Rajapaksas and their cohorts have been articulated not only at the last Presidential Elections, the parade of their kith and kin to and from the various investigative bodies has gone a long way to convince a curious electorate as to how and what these political hooligans of the Rajapaksa era corrupted a gullible civil service which ultimately became even more corrupt than their corruptors!
Nevertheless, the following changes and their inescapable cascade of consequential by-events have at times struggled to transform the political landscape of Sri Lanka.
1. The defeat of the Rajapaksa Presidency
2. Election of Maithripala Sirisena as President as a common candidate of a coalition of socio-political forces of Sri Lanka
3. Election of a UNP-led Parliament
4. The evisceration of the 100 Day programme
5. Bond-Scam scandal
6. The eruption of the fissures between President Sirisena and Premier Wickremesinghe
7. Non-event of the Rajapaksa prosecution to an end
8. Local Government Elections
9. Resultant meandering in the political woods

Each of these events and sub-events has engendered another sequence of events which in turn have turned into a cause and thereby producing a never-ending cycle of cause andeffect dynamic.
Whatever happens in the aftermath of each event or sub-event, what one must bear in mind is the universal truth of facts and hard cold facts that definitively have had a serious impact on the lives of all Sri Lankans.
Political pundits and statisticians have gone back to their drawing boards. They ponder, more often than not, on the what-if phenomenon of life and in that maddeningly uncertain socio-political drama, they have repeatedly failed to understand one simple and crushingly ugly fact that facts do matter in the ultimate analysis of politics and its history.
In the context of such an unequivocal brutality of the political life of a nation, the current impasse in todays scenario looks natural and inconsequential. A reversal to a once-defeated power-cabal, which is the Rajapaksa rule, seems, at least to their own political friends and supporters, a vindication of their deeds and thoughts.
Sloganeering that consisted of electric chairs, selfless patriotism and sovereignty of the nation that ruled a frenzied world of delusion and cultivated deceit are looming ominously on the horizon again.
It is going to be extremely difficult and practically impossible to confront an emotion-driven mob and convince them that what occurred in the recent past was corruption, nepotism and the avaricious pursuit of power and is no good for the greater good of the country.

It is no secret that given the right social and political milieu, excessive expression of deeply held prejudices and partialities would be welcome as an open invitation for unrestricted assault on reason and justice

Sloganeering and political branding have its own niche and it has been proven beyond a shadow of a doubt by Donald Trump in another part of the world- an advanced capitalist society such as the United States of America.
Dont ever forget that just before the Nazi takeover Germany was a well-educated, steeped in high cultural and social values. They were a steeply-read nation that enjoyed Wagners serene music and Van Goughs sensitive lines of painting as their pastime.
It is no secret that given the right social and political milieu, excessive expression of deeply held prejudices and partialities would be welcome as an open invitation for unrestricted assault on reason and justice.
We in Sri Lanka experienced this obscenity of political propaganda under the Rajapaksa cabal. Entrenched in a bubble of all-consuming power and greed, the Rajapaksas released within this bubble a force under the cover of patriotism and partisanship for the land, the race and the faith.
The same forces are threatening to raise their ugly profiles today and the unhindered participation of the mob variety of the average men and women in the country do not seem to care.
Forthcoming Presidential Elections are being planned and scheduled against this backdrop. It is no easy task to challenge them.
The UNPs task looks even more desperate. The repeating mistakes and misjudgments are taking the Party of Ranil Wickremesinghe to the edges of extinction and sure death.
Superficial operational adjustments introduced into the traditional structures of the Party do not seem to produce a fundamental change in its very outlook.
The coalition and its operational arms that delivered the Presidency to Maithripala Sirisena need to be mustered and coalesced to a new Presidential candidate. Who could it be That is the proverbial sixty-four million dollar question.
Here are some of the would-be contenders:
1. Ranil Wickremesinghe 2. Sajith Premadasa 3. Navin Dissanayake 4. Dark Horse candidate
Arguments for and against the current leader of the UNP and Prime Minister of the land, Ranil Wickremesinghe have been made almost to exhaustive lengths
and breadths.
In fact, they seem to have been foreclosed. The overwhelming loyalty of the Northern and Upcountry Tamils and Eastern Muslims towards Wickremesinghe is beyond doubt.
It is not conceivable that any other aforementioned candidate would enjoy such uncontested loyalty from the minorities, except perhapsNavin Dissanayake.
The leadership of the Tamil communities, both Northern and Upcountry, has been quite vocal about their political grievances and their adherence to the fundamentals of reconciliation and Tamilhomeland concepts.

A reversal to a once-defeated power-cabal, which is the Rajapaksa rule, seems, at least to their own political friends and supporters, a vindication of their deeds and thoughts.

Political expediency and misplaced sense of patriotism might derail Sajith Premadasa on these fronts, yet he might be of the opinion that his popularity among Sinhalese Buddhists and especially amongst the Buddhist Clergy, cultivated over a decade or so by giving away goodies of sorts to the temples around the countryside, would overcome the deficit that he has with the Northern Tamils.
Yet, one brutal fact that Sajith needs to confront is, despite all these efforts towards pacifying the Buddhist Clergy, he has not been able to translate that gesture into votes.
Even in the recently held LG Elections, he did not win his electorate, nor could he securethe district.
The argument that he is in the SLFP den- Rajapaksa-led Hambantota- cannot hold water as a leader is supposed to carry his own electorate when all other chips are down.
Navin Dissanayake, on the other hand, did manage to win not only his electorate; he managed to win his entire district, Nuwara Eliya which in the context of a Presidential Election is a microcosm of the country.
Nuwara Eliya within its geographical boundaries has some ancient Sinhalese Buddhist villages. Both Kotmale and Hanguranketha from which Navin Dissanayakes paternal grandmother and grandfather respectively hailed, are steeped in tradition and culture that is unmatched by some other such villages in the country.
If the people of such tradition and culture could depart from the rest of the normal pattern of voting, it certainly speaks volumes for such an allegiance to a political leader in the district. Gamini Dissanayake, Navins father, enjoyed such unquestioned and unquestionable personal loyalty from his supporters. Navin, it looks like, has retainedthat loyalty.
Yet, both Sajith and Navin might not be able to gather around them the coalition forces that assembled around Maithripala Sirisena in 2015.
That is not due to a special personal attraction of Sirisena; it is solely due to the fact that the coalition Government that was formed after the 2015 elections failed to deliver on its election pledges.
The UNP and its friends need a dark horse; a candidate whose baggage does not carry within itself dark secrets of corruption and nepotism; a fifth horseman, so to speak who will be seen as a deliverer beyond all expectations.
Only Karu Jayasuriya, the current Speaker of the House of Parliament, fits into that module- a dark horse or the fifth horseman.
I will delve into this possible candidate in my next column, yet could not suppress the urge to throw this thought out for our readers to ponder upon. Fifth horsemen or a dark horse candidate who could possibly mount a formidable challenge to any Pohottuwa candidate, a Rajapaksa or any other, has more than an outside chance of victory in the nextPresidential Elections.

## Title: Living Together is a Blessing - Bishop De Chikera.

Living Together is a Blessing - Bishop De Chikera.
	
Living Together is a resource for all those of us who are interested in inter religious interaction. In time to come we will know whether this book will receive a place in the vast library of books produced on the topic. Hence, this is a celebration of a gift more than the launch of a book, a gift to all Sri Lankans and to all interested persons across the globe. The Bishop of the Anglican Church, Rev. Duleep De Chickera made these observations at the occasion of the launch of the book Living Together by DeepalSooriyaarachchi at the Post Graduate Institute of Management in Borella. The book captures the authors experiences over two decades of living with people from various faiths in different parts of the world meeting over 15 times. The launch event was organized by the PIM Alumni Association. Speakers from Germany and India who had been participating in that Inter Religious Living Dialogue experiment also addressed the audience in addition to the Director of the PIM Prof. AjanthaDharmasiri and Sheik ArkamNooramith an Islamic scholar. The event provided the audience with the taste of inter religious living together.
Speaking further at the occasion Rev. De Chikera said that he would like to consider this book under three themes 
Firstly, this is an extremely relevant book. The theme that runs from cover to cover is a story about a group of people who have come together from time to time to understand each others religions in a spirit of respect, sensitivity and dignity. As you read the book you find the rhythm of encounter and separation each feeding into the other. This is why I see the relevance of this book particularly to the people of this country. Except for a few districts where a mono culture prevails several of us encounter the persons of other religions in our day to day life, whether it is at the market place, school, hospital, work place, wedding or funeral, in the bus, on the train, in our university, parliament etc. the people of this nation have the constant opportunity to encounter and part with the religious other. This book provokes the Sri Lankans of different faiths to use these encounters in the same spirit as the members of the living dialogue described in the book to deepen mutual understanding.
Some weeks ago my sisters husband passed and theirs was a Christian and Buddhist marriage. The the Buddhist monk spoke a few words at the funeral and some of the Christians listened to these words and developed an interest about what Buddhists say about the afterlife. This lead to questions and further clarifications. What we need to do is to use our encounters with one another in small groups such as families, neighbors and colleagues, and talk about each others beliefs and understanding of life. When you meet at a wedding, try to gain an understanding of how different religions approach marriage. Ask questions with respect, receive explanations with respect, or for instance when the elections come ask what different religions have said about governance. We have a tendency to develop a courteous aloofness. So we do not ask questions. But the book invites us to do so.
The second, the strength of this book is that it is extremely timely. Living together among different religions is never an easy thing. Weve been through tense times, were currently facing some tension and will continue to face tension between religions. Hostilities and aggressive agendas upset people and what has our response been so far It has been worthy tolerance but even this strength of tolerance is running out. The book suggests another step, that is engagement. It shows how this coming together has made them stronger in their own faith because of the presence of the other person. So I become a better Christian because of my Buddhist, Hindu and Islamic neighbor. Hence, the presence of people of other faiths is a blessing.
In Christianity we speak of loving thy neighbor. But in Buddhism what is preached is the love of all beings. That includes the neighbor but goes beyond that. Through this conversation I went back to the Bible and found in Creation Theology that it has been there from the beginning, that Jews and Christians have been instructed to care for nature and ecological justice. If not for this encounter with Buddhism I would not have discovered this.
We have all lived our lives either on a campus or down the street where we could hear the bells of the church that ring in the Angelus at six in the morning, at noon and at six in the evening. When we hear them we are supposed to reflect in intercessory prayers for the people of the world. For one year we lived in Rajagiriya, away from hearing distance of the Church bells. I missed the bells. But there was a silver lining, for our house was located in between two mosques. Those mosques would call people to pray five times a day. So I used that instead of the church bells and prayed five times a day and became an even better Christian.
One of the greatest theologians, Paul Nitter expressed these thoughts in a book that got him in to trouble, but the book was very popular among inter faith activists. The name of the book says it all. Without the Buddha I may not be a Christian.
The third theme of the book is that it brings us an uncomfortable challenge. While your group and many in the country and around the world appreciate the dialogue, there are also those in the world who dislike and distrust inter religious dialogue. They think of those who entertain such thoughts as traitors. How can one be a Christian and appreciate Buddhism These are fundamentalists or extremists. In their view one has to convert to their view or they need to be eliminated. They want a world where there is only one type, and that is their kind. What do we do with such people
The spirit of this book says engage with them, however difficult it is. Be patient, be respectful and be strong as well. Try to persuade them that the best option when living in inter religious societies like ours, is to interact with each other and enrich our lives.
I recommend that this book be translated into Sinhala and Tamil, for it needs to reach the far corners of this country.

Mangala denies any revelation on assassination plot by Indian national
	
Finance and Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera said today several media outlets had given wide publicity to false, unattributed claims that the CID had alleged in court that an Indian national had confirmed the existence of a plot to assassinate President Sirisena, former president Mahinda Rajapaksa and his family members.
He said in a statement that the reason CID officers sought to detain Mr. Thomas was to conduct further investigations on a suspicion that Mr. Thomas may have violated Section 5 of the Prevention of Terrorism Act No. 48 of 1978 by failing to report information pertaining to plans to commit an act of terror.
This suspicion was filed in writing by the CID and stated verbally in open court. Further evidence in support of this submission was shared with the Magistrate.
These news reports are false, baseless and inflammatory. The CID has not, at any time, in either written or verbal submissions to the Magistrates Court, made any statement that could lead to the conclusion or inference that an assassination plot has been established or corroborated, whether through Indian national Marceli Thomas or by any other means, he said in a statement.
The Criminal Investigation Department (CID) is conducting investigations into serious allegations of an alleged conspiracy to assassinate President Maithripala Sirisena, former President Mahinda Rajapaksa and former Defence Secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa, amongst others. As of this time, the only source for these allegations is a statement made by Mr. A.M. Namal Kumara. While the Criminal Investigation Department has yet to report any evidence substantiating the existence of such a plot, these allegations are so grave in their implication that CID detectives must take every precaution thoroughly investigate and seek to corroborate their every element, as a matter of national security, the statement added.
He said in the statement that the CID officers on Monday arrested Indian national Marceli Thomas in connection with this investigation.
Mr. Thomas was produced before the Colombo Fort Magistrates Court, and an order to detain him in CID custody was sought and obtained.
Journalists are free to observe any court proceedings in person or to apply for transcripts of proceedings and court filings through the Registrar of the Court. Therefore, it is inexcusable to make such serious and inflammatory statements on a matter of public record without citing any sources or mode of corroboration. Responsible media organisations and public figures alike should restrict their reporting on judicial matters to the written and verbal submissions made by parties before the court. Such caution is all the more paramount with regards to reporting on criminal investigations with serious implications to the security of the state, it said.

Media freedom and social responsibility - EDITORIAL
	
Twenty years have passed since the Colombo Declaration on Media Freedom and Social responsibility was signed by The Editors Guild of Sri Lanka (TEGOSL) in April 1998 together with the Newspaper Society of Sri Lanka and the FreeMedia Movement.
An international conference has been organized from Sept. 27 (tomorrow) to 30 to mark the 20th anniversary of the Colombo Declaration. It is organized by the Sri Lanka Press Institute (SLPI) in partnership with its constituent partners, UNESCO and the Royal Norwegian Embassy. 
The conference will also coincide with the UN designated International Day for the Universal Access to Information (IDUAI). The parley will be formally opened by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe tomorrow, and on Friday, the keynote address on IDUAI will be delivered by Speaker Karu Jayasuriya, followed by an address by Mahinda Gammanpila, Chairman, RTI Commission. Representatives from Australia, Bangladesh, Canada, China, Germany, India, Norway, Pakistan and the United Kingdom will participate. As one can expect one of the items in the agenda is the revisiting of theColombo Declaration.
Colombo Declaration was a result of a tedious effort by the media community in Sri Lanka after a difficult period with disappearances of journalists, long drawn censorship under the name of national security and law suits against the journalists who performed their duty towards the community. It was signed especially in the backdrop of a campaign launched by TEGOSL and other fraternal media organizations to have the laws of criminal defamation repealed after five TEGOSL members had been indicted under the Penal Code forcriminal defamation.
Yet, it did not insist only on the rights of the journalistic community and the media in general, rather it emphasized the responsibility of the industry as well, as its theme Media Freedom and Social Responsibility had signified. 
Hence, the industry took steps to overcome some of the problems within it by creating Sri Lanka Press Institute (SLPI) and two arms under it, the Sri Lanka College of Journalism (SLCJ) and the Press Complaints Commission of Sri Lanka (PCCSL) in order to train its members and enhance the ethical standards of them, while continuing to press the governments to take steps to ensuremedia freedom. 
During the initial years of the SLPI, the International Federation of Journalists after a survey said that only 4 percent of journalists in Sri Lanka had been aware of ethics, leave alone having training on the matter. However, the PCCSL has since conducted dozens of workshops on journalistic ethics for the staff members of the mainstream newspapers and for the provincial journalists in all districts in the country. And the SLCJ provided training to hundreds of journalists, in the form of a diploma course andmid-career courses. 
One cannot be satisfied with the achievements by the industry for the past twenty years, though it had some remarkable outcomes. The awareness it created among the concerned sections of the society had resulted in the abolition of provisions in the Penal Code and the Press Council Act in 2002, the repeal of Section 118 of the Penal Code which had penalized attempts by contumacious or insulting words or signs, to bring the President into contempt and repeal of the 1978 amendment to the Parliamentary Powers and Privileges Act of 1953 which had given Parliament to deal with serious breaches of privilege. Also with the inclusion of right to information in the 19th Amendment to the Constitution which was passed in April 2015 the right to information has become a constitutional right of the people though with a wide rangeof restrictions. 
Yet the majority of laws, the Colombo Declaration wanted to abolish in the interests of the media in particular and the general public in general are still in force and the media community also had to travel through a period of abductions, killing, torture and arson attacks after the signing of the Declaration and its revision at its 10th anniversary in 2008. 
And the industry has to find solutions to the problems such as fake news and hate speech which have taken a dangerous turn after the proliferation of the social media, the politicization of media and the media becoming a tool in the hands of politicians. We hope the three day conference starting from tomorrow would be a milestone in finding solutions tothese issues.

No need of foreign interference; allow us to solve our problems-MS
	
President Maithripala Sirisena on Tuesday called on the international community to allow Sri Lankan people to solve their problems on their own, and said: as an independent country we do not want any foreign power to exert influence on us.
Addressing the 73rd Session of the United Nations General Assembly in New York, he said Sri Lanka is taking action to consolidate peace and forge ahead to develop the economy, and such a nation deserves the support and understanding of the international community. I urge the international community to allow Sri Lankan people to solve their problems on their own, he said.
As an independent country, we do not want any foreign power to exert influence on us. We want to appeal to the international community to give us the room to resolve the problems that we are facing so that the right of the Sri Lankan people to find solutions to their problems is respected,| he said.

Quoting from the Buddhas preaching in the Sallasutta of Samyuktha Nikaye in Thripitaka, he said if a man is pierced with a dart, he will suffer physical pain. When he worries about it, he suffers more pain. Hence, there are two kinds of pains suffered by the man. When it comes to Sri Lanka, it is the people who suffered pain due to war and they continue to feel pain when they think about it. Therefore, I take this opportunity to call upon your support and cooperation, he said.
The President pointed out that the exodus of refugees is a major issue in international politics and urged the United Nations to play a bigger role because of the paramount importance of the issue.

I must mention that today, the whole world is facing challenges posed by severe changes in climate. I would like to propose that the community of nations must focus on implementing the Paris Accord that the world reached in 2015, by further improving the unity that we reached by signing that accord. We must remember that the Paris Accord is critically important to the future of the entire biosphere and humanity, he said.
The President categorically stated that the government is committed to working tirelessly to achieving reconciliation by fostering understanding among all ethnic and linguistic groups while eliminating mutual suspicion and hatred in order to create a society where all can live freely and harmoniously. Further, we are dedicated to ensuring that the country will accomplish economic prosperity.

He said that during the last three and a half years, the government has taken several important steps that are necessary to consolidate democracy, freedom, good governance, media freedom and independence of the judiciary. Through such transformative steps, we have laid the foundation necessary to forge national reconciliation, communal harmony and ensure non-recurrence of conflict in our country, he said.
As a country that has suffered violent conflict for 30 years, we are drawing from experience and lessons learned to strengthen national reconciliation, and we are determined to prevent the recurrence of conflict. We have given priority in this context to consolidate freedom and democracy in our country, and through a strong foundation of national reconciliation forged through unity and friendship among communities, the President said.

Political murders in the world : The asassination of  a lovable Prime Minister
	
Today is the 59th death anniversary of SWRD Bandaranaike


Recorded history reveals that from very ancient times there had been political murders . As an example, during the roman empire, there had been blatant and devastating political murders of the highest magnitude. The assassination of Julius Ceasar on 15th March 44 BC, can be attributed as the most famous political murder in history. He was promoted and ordained as the supreme commander and also as the dictator for life, by his colleagues and friends but differences of opinion culminated among his closest comrades and it led to his murder and he was killed in the name of liberty. 
Brutus was the leading figure, behind the assassination. Cicero, the Roman politician who earned his mark as a philosopher, poet, orator, was not a party to the plot, but was an eyewitness to the murder. 
There had been political murders even in the land of Mother Democracy-in the United Kingdom. The serving British Prime Minister, Spencer Perceval was killed in the Lobby of the House of Commons on 11th May 1812 by John Bellingham, a merchant who blamed the government for his debt. British police records reveals that the militant Irish republicans have assassinated six members of parliament from 1882 to 1990. The first female MP to be assassinated was Helen Joanne Cox, a British Labour party politician who was the member of parliament for the Batley and Spen constituency from her election in May 2015, until her murder in 2016. She was a graduate of Cambridge, specializing in political science. 
She was assassinated on 16 June 2016 by Thomas Mair, a white supremacist. 
In the USA, ABRAHAM LINCOLN, the 16th President was brutally assassinated on April 14, 1865, by a well known stage actor, John Wilkes Booth, while attending the play OUR AMERICAN COUSIN at Fords Theater in Washington, DC.
At the end of 1963, the White House occupied by charismatic President John F. Kennedy and his trusted political advisers were hurriedly preparing for the upcoming presidential campaign. President Kennedy was advised by his closest supporters that a feud among party leaders in Texas could jeopardize his chances of carrying the state in 1964, and one of his strategies was to strengthen the bonds of democrats in the State of Texas. He was also aware of the fact that a small group of disgruntled extremists in Texas was contributing to the political tensions in this state. In Dallas, Texas the US ambassador to the United Nations, Adlai Stevenson was physically manhandled and attacked by a group of extremists a month earlier after making a speech there. However, John F. Kennedy a born political strategist decided to move the people in Texas and jump into the political fray. 
However, THE MAN OF WHITE HOUSE, President John F. Kennedy was killed by a gunman in the evening of November 22, 1963 as he rode in a motorcade through Dealey Plaza in downtown, Dallas, Texas. 
Martin Luther King, the unchallenged leader of the civil rights movement in USA was gunned down at the Lorraine Motel in Memphis, Tennesse on April 4, 1968. He was a Nobel Peace Prize laureate. For this crime, James Earl Ray, a fugitive from the Missouri State, was arrested on June 8, 1968 and prosecuted and was sentenced to 99 years imprisonment. 
On February 21, 1965 another Negro leader Malcolm X took to the stage of the Audobon Ballroom, a site often used for civil rights meetings in USA and was gunned in the presence of his wife and children. Investigations into the murder revealed that the assassination came after a public feud between Malcolm X and the Nation of Islams founder, Elijah Muhammad.

On 25th September 1959, Somarama dressed in a yellow robe gunned down the Prime Minister who believed in the power of the ballot throughout his illustrious life. On the following day, the lovable Prime Minister, the great democrat departed from us

There were a series of attempts to kill the legendary revolutionary leader Fidel Castro by the Central Intelligence Agency and mercenaries but all these attempts were foiled by the intelligence units of the revolutionary armed forces in Cuba. The investigations carried-out so far into the clandestine operations into the killing of Mahathma Gandhi in India and SWRD Bandaranaike in Sri Lanka reveals the fact although there were only two killers directly involved in these murders, there were hidden factors and mysterious ring leaders behind these conspiracies. The motives behind these two murders remains the same. They were motivated by communalism, hatred and greed for wealth.
Extensive research conducted by Larrry Collins and Dominique Lapierre, best illustrated in their thesis, Freedom at Midnight explains in detail why Gandhi was liquidated. It has been proved here, that Gandhis assassination was the outcome of a well planned conspiracy launched by Hindu fundamentalists to eliminate Gandhi from the Indian political scene. Further, scholars and historians like A.G. Noorani have relentlessly written about how V.D. Savarkar, the Hindutva ideologue and former President of the Hindu Mahasabha, were involved in this treacherous act. Further, Noorani referred to communications written by the home minister V. Patel to Prime Minister Jawarharlal Nehru in 1948, conforming that it was a fanatical wing of the Hindu Mahasabha directly under the commission of Savarkar that hatched the conspiracy and saw it through.
The killer Nathuram Vinayak Godse, who pumped three bullets into Gandhis chest was also a Hindu extremist.
Gandhi never wanted a divided India, he wanted A United India in the true sense of the word.
Even in India today, patriotic historians believe that the Hindu extremist ideology which killed Gandhi is the same as the one which threatens India today. Professor Mridula Mukherjee of the Delhis Jawaharlal University is of the view that the communal forces and their divisive ideology which killed Gandhi is the same as the one which threatens India today in the form of the Ghar Wapsi and Love Jihad campaignsThe main objective of communal forces is to increase antagonism between communities. Its their aim to promote the idea that religious identities must be at loggerheads with each other. The vicious atmosphere that was created by them at the time of Gandhis assassination is the same as it is today.


In India, Indira Gandhi and her son Rajiv Gandhi, were also assassinated for political reasons, cemented with a communal anger. In Egypt, President Sadam Hussein was also brutally killed for political grievances. 
In Sri Lanka, S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike who swept to power in 1956 with the backing of the organized left movement in the country took several progressive measures including nationalization, closing of foreign bases in the country, opening diplomatic connections with the socialist camp, paddy lands act and paving the way for a public sector economy, sweeping agrarian reforms by introducing the paddy lands act etc. He made Sinhala, the official language of Sri Lanka and was moving forward to ameliorate the grievances of the Tamil people by implementing the provision of reasonable use of Tamil in government administrative affairs. Further, he signed the Bandaranaike-Chelvanayakam Pact to heal the wounds of the Tamil People. 
Vested interests saw a developing threat to their inherited way of life. Buddharakhitha, very cunningly introduced his nominee to the cabinet, Wimala Wijewardena. Several deals, including setting up of shipping contracts and disposal of scrap iron in a big way were some of the business deals introduced by the vested interests to the Prime Minister, Bandaranaike. Due do the inner struggle, Philip Gunawardena and William De Silva had to leave the government. However, the Prime Minister was not ready to bow down his head to each and every demand of the right-wing forces. 
The struggle came to a final point, where Buddharakkitha and fellow accomplices decided to get rid of the Prime Minister. They made use of frustrated Somarama for the devastating act.
On 25th September 1959, Somarama dressed in a yellow robe gunned down the Prime Minister who believed in the power of the ballot throughout his illustrious life. On the following day, the lovable Prime Minister, the great democrat departed from us.

POLITICAL SCREWUPS AND MIRACULOUS  COMEBACKS!
	

Aside from the Rajapaksa family do we not have any senior political figures or families in the SLFP or our country for Presidential contenders!!! Is it so blatantly obvious that MR does not hesitate to say that his brother Gota is the most likely and the most suitable candidate for the Presidency Apart from this contention, we are looking at all the Ranaviru Officers, who are currently languishing in prison, the most important one being the Admiral, aided by his fellow officers, who fled the country to Mexico quite recently!!!
They are all a disgrace to the uniforms they are wearing because they felt that their uniform would give them the right, the protection they needed to commit crimes!!! LTTEs Prabhakaran once said that the Sinhalese people are capable of forgetting in a week an injury or a crime done to them or done by them!!! This is most applicable in the case of Ravi K because ALL his sins have either been forgiven or forgotten and Ranil is very anxious to bring him back into the Ministerial fold!!! The persistent WHY still rankles!!!

Gone with the wind 
Who questions the sons of the previous regime when they find it necessary to fly to the USA or Singapore for their medical check-ups now Is it because the Minister of Health has not been capable of elevating our Health Service or do they not trust our local Doctors Apart from them, Jaliya went for eye surgery and the poor man has not been able to find his way back here after that!!! No one is concerned and he is not missed either!!! The Doctor at the Colombo Eye Hospital who said nothing could be done for Jaliya in Sri Lanka has gone missing too!!! Oh, but arent we forgetting something here He gave Jaliya the green light to go so WHAT HAPPENED TO THE DOC HOW MUCH DID HE GET FOR THAT VERY STRANGELY NOTHING HAS BEEN SAID OR DONE ABOUT JALIYAS INCIDENT OR THE DOCTOR CONCERNED!!! It has all been conveniently swept under the carpet!!!

Lessons learnt
Borrowing from Robert Frost, The Woods are lovely, dark and deep and I have promises to keep and miles to go before I sleep; sure, the political woods are SO lovely, SO ENTICING, the entire Cabinet has suddenly come wide awake; they have promises to keep and miles to go before they sleep again!!! We have the President himself recalling the entire staff of the Austrian Embassy to teach EVERYONE a lesson!!! Well done, but what an EXPENSIVE LESSON!!! Then we are told that the Moratuwa Municipal Council is making a multitude of suggestions to enhance the lives of the people and make the area liveable and comfortable for the people!!! Better late than NEVER!!! Where were they all this time, sleeping like the rest The UDA is to provide houses island-wide!!! Another glaring election gimmick!!! Akila says the UNP is going to make vital decisions SOON, never NOW!!! About time they did, all our young politicians have not been given a chance to prove their mettle and they should have been!!! Thank God, a lesson is being taught by keeping Johnston behind bars; a much-needed lesson!!!

Sugar sugar
Talk of controversies and contentions and Pages A6 and A8 of the 19th September DAILY MIRROR seem to have a blooper  on Page 6 we are told that the import levy on sugar is to be lifted and conversely Page 8 says Tax on sugar raised by Rs. 18/. Cant they make up their minds as to what is correct The sugar price has definitely been increased!!! Price of a cylinder of gas to be raised by Rs. 190/-but hang on to your seat folks; the wheat flour price hike is to be reversed and 250,000 teachers are to be given a salary hike!!! Thats the icing onthe cake!!!


Hatch catch
There seems to be much hue and cry about the alleged plot to assassinate the President and former Secretary of Defence!!! The JO has agitated demanding the interdiction of DIG Nalaka de Silva and the IGP who have been accused of working with DIGde Silva!!!
Our Prime Minister has very kindly offered security to the former Secretary of Defence and thanked everyone for the interest taken in regard to the Presidents security; he also asked them not to use this to gain unnecessary political mileage!!! The other bone of contention is the take-off of the Admiral who fled to Mexico!!! If there were no crimes hanging over his head, as is being alleged, why did he have to be assisted by his Officers to flee the country What was he guilty of, we would like to know Apparently, the CDS is back, we wonder why


Prison room with a view 
SARPAYA we are told is spitting venom even from prison and culling social media at that!!! His two female assistants seem to be at his beck and call but the Attorney Generals Assistant gets no assistance from any of them!!! It is good to be in Prison these days, you can do what you want, access Social Media, have your own private lines, give directions/orders; get into Prison here and the world is your oyster!!

                                 THE VOICE

Postpone luxury spending by couple of months to stabilize LKR: Dr. Harsha
	
State Minister of National Policies and Economic Affairs Dr Harsha de Silva asked the high-income earners of the country to be socially conscious to help cut the demand at the margin in the face of the rapid rupee depreciation.
Social consciousness of our high income people is also important now; perhaps postpone by just a couple of months that new luxury car or that trip to Alaska. These will all help to cut the demand at the margin, Dr. Silva said in a Facebook post.
The full post;
I feel that the LKR has overshot (depreciated more than) its fair value; it should strengthen somewhat in the coming weeks. But, the fundamental issue is lack of exports.
The LKR is again under pressure. The reasons for the current episode are primarily exogenous; driven mainly by outflows of US dollars from emerging markets due to a robust US economy, gradual tightening (of interest rates) by the Federal Reserve and investors taking refuge in the US with escalating trade tensions with China. While the impact of this shock is being felt across the world, current account deficit emerging countries, like Sri Lanka, are getting battered more than those with healthy trade balances.
However, whether the slide we saw was fully warranted is a question I have in my mind. I feel the LKR at 170 has overshot its market-determined fair value. It could be partly disruptive speculation and partly genuine lack of confidence in the Central Bank to have the situation under control. However, I think both these issues have now been addressed and the LKR will find its equilibrium once the dust settles. Some appreciation of the currency is warranted.
The Central Bank must be credited for being responsible and not burning reserves to defend the LKR at levels earlier not feasible. We saw how during the 2011-12 home made crisis (having held the currency artificially at 110 levels for months) ended up; losing almost USD 4 billion or close to half of the reserves in just a few months and yet the LKR depreciating by close to 13 percent. (Look at the graph)
My view is that the Central Bank could maintain the LKR at a level adjusted slightly upwards to correct for the overshooting.
A criticism, however, is that they should not sterilize the interventions; in other words, the loss of LKR in the market to purchase USD sold by the CBSL should not be replaced with new LKR by the CBSL. The unsterilized defence will lead to some tightening of rates but that is an okay price to pay for a short while to stabilize the markets and build confidence around the new equilibrium exchange rate.
The (brave) decision of our government to introduce the fuel price formula is certainly a huge boost to limit demand and the temporary measure like 100 percent margin on LC for import of cars for personal use will help stem import demand. The social consciousness of our high income people are also important now; perhaps postpone by just a couple of months that new luxury car or that trip to Alaska. These will all help to cut the demand at the margin.
I am not planning on explaining the more fundamental reason for the continuous pressure on the LKR today, but those who follow my writing are fully aware of how strongly I have been arguing for even stronger policy measure to increase the exports to GDP share of Sri Lanka including FTAs and unilateral liberalization of trade to increase investments and more conducive immigration policy to bring in technical expertise to move from producing low value simple products to high value complex products. That is the only sustainable solution to the continuous pressure on the LKR and to create high wage jobs.
When our exports to GDP share started to decline steadily year after year; from around 27 percent in 2005 to around 12.5 percent in 2015 with the Rajapaksa regime dismissing it with talk of economic nationalism the writing was on the wall. What we see today is clearly and absolutely the outcome of that purely short-term populist economic policy of 10 plus years. I shudder to think what could happen if God forbid those who continue to advocate inward-looking policies grab 'power'; where will the LKR stop 500
We are doing our best to turn the declining export ratios. I am happy to note it has finally turned around. WE have succeeded in getting duty free access to the EU via GSP plus and exports are increasing. We have successfully signed the first FTA in decades with Singapore and others are in the offing. We have liberalized trade further and will do so with immigration.

Protest against travesty of justice
	

Expedite investigations 
	Access to family
	Communication

A massive gathering which included family members, friends, human rights activists and other supporters, staged a silent protest at the Independence Square last Tuesday seeking fair treatment and to expedite the investigations into the arrest of alleged terrorist-accused Kamer Nizamdeen. The protesters claimed that Nizamdeen, who has been detained by the Australian authorities, has been framed and is innocent. 
Nizamdeen, a 25 year old PhD student was arrested in Sydney on August 30 by the New South Wales Police. Since then his family and friends have come forward to show support claiming that Nizamdeen has been framed. 
Speaking on behalf of Nizamdeens family, his maternal uncle, Dr. Khaleel Cassim said that the family is very alarmed at the manner in which the formers arrest took place hastily based on flimsy evidence which was a notebook. The Police had allegedly found a notebook that named a number of locations and individuals as potential targets. 

We have utmost confidence in the judicial process in Australia.Kamer has been framed and we have faith that he will be proved innocent

The notebook was not found in Kamers possession at the time of arrest. It was found in his old work station where he had not been working at since August 2, 2018, he said. Since the time of his arrest up to now Kamer has reiterated consistently that the alleged notes in the notebook are not his hand writing, he added. Placards held at the protest read Handwriting is unique. Can be identified instantly. Why is it taking time, Expedite investigation on notebook and 18 days and yet no signs of investigating the notebook. 
The uncle urged the investigators to apprehend the person who actually wrote the statements. We have utmost confidence in the judicial process in Australia.Kamer has been framed and we have faith that he will be proved innocent. At the moment the matter is in the hands of the investigators. The actual culprit is at large and is a danger to life and property in Australia, he said at the protest where around 750 protesters had gathered in support. 
The family has not heard from him since the day he was arrested. Family members have still been denied access to him. Kamer has not been allowed to access telephone calls which he is legally entitled to, and we are deeply concerned. This lack of communication between him and his parents and close family is causing mental agony, stress and hardship to the family. It is tearing our family apart, said the uncle. Placards read 18 days, yet no phone calls allowed. 

Family members have still been denied access to him. Kamer has not been allowed to access telephone calls which he is legally entitled to, and we are deeply concerned. This lack of communication between him and his parents and close family is causing mental agony, stress and hardship to the family tearing our family apart

A public statement issued stated that Kamer Nizamdeen was permitted to contact one family member at the time of arrest, but was denied access to legal counsel and family members immediately thereafter. The statement claimed that he did not have legal representation when he was produced before court to consider granting bail and was denied bail. He had been granted access to an attorney only on September 7, a week after his arrest. It further stated that he has been placed in solitary confinement under high security. 
Human Rights Activist Sandun Thudugala said that the protest was to ensure that Nizamdeen had access to a fair legal process, and his family. Nothing has been proven yet. We are deeply concerned by how some media outlets have reported this incident, he further said. 
Speaking to the Daily Mirror, Foreign Affairs Ministry spokesperson Mahishini Colonne said that the Consul General was working with close cooperation with Australian authorities in this regard. He has been provided consular access, she said. 
Protesters said that the travesty has to be addressed immediately. However, Nizamdeen is to appear in court only on October 24. 
Former Principal of Asian International School (AIS), Goolbai Gunasekara writing in the Daily Mirror said that it was impossible to accept that Nizamdeen was radicalized. 
Kamer was gentle, sweet natured and comfortable with himself. He had no hang-ups. He had a happy home and projected an aura of personal calmness and self control. Perhaps he was too successful at what he did and that upset his contemporaries, she stated.

SLMC confused after SC verdict on SAITM graduates: GMOA
	
Following the Supreme Court (SC) verdict over the SAITM graduates issue, the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) was confused as to whether they should implement the SC verdict or the amended Kotelawala Defence University (KDU) Act, the Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) said yesterday.
Addressing a press conference GMOA Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge said that the SLMC would be liable for contempt of Court in both instances, even if it implemented the SC verdict and violates the KDU Act or implements the KDU Act and disregards the SC verdict.
He said that during the GMOA Central Committee meeting many issues that could arise as a result of the SC ruling had been discussed.
The GMOA represented the case as an intervening party in the case filed by the SLMC. However, the GMOA claimed that both the SLMC and the GMOA were not aware of the date of the ruling and were only informed on the morning of the day when the verdict was given.
We will not challenge the Supreme Court decision. But we urge the President and the Government to intervene in the matter and explain the contradicting terms in the Supreme Court decision and the KDU Act, he said.
Meanwhile, GMOA Assistant Secretary Dr. Nalinda Herath said there should be strong communication and connection among the countrys Executive, the Legislature and the Judiciary.
He said that the GMOA Central Committee had given authority to its Executive Committee to decide on the probable trade union action against the Governments double standards over this issue.
The Supreme Court on Friday (21) upheld the Court of Appeals (CA) judgement issued to allow the graduates of South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM) to be registered with the SLMC.
The CA on January 31ordered the SLMC to allow registration of the SAITM graduates at the SLMC. However, the SLMC challenged this decision at the Supreme Court. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

There were conspiracies to kill us: Gotabaya
	
There had always been conspiracies to kill us. There were death threats even when Prabhakaran was alive. But we endured all these threats due to virtues we posses, former Secretary of Defence Gotabaya Rajapaksa said.
Speaking as the chief guest at the religious ceremony on an invitation of the Chief Incumbent of Embulgama Rajamaha Viharaya-Ven Dankande Bodhiwansa Thera, held in connection with the unveiling of the Samadhi Buddha Statue and the inauguration of Sathara Maha Devalaya at the temple premises he said that one cannot afford to live in fear of death.
"We must do something for the country where we are born. I never asked to strengthen my security - people are there for my protection, he said.
In response to the questions by the media personnel about Minister Sarath Fonsekas remarks about his non-eligibility for security, Gotabaya Rajapaksa said leaders of the country would decide about providing security for him or otherwise. Anyone can express his opinion. I am also aware of a young UNP parliamentarian saying that I deserve protection as well as the president as I have served the country as defence secretary.
When asked whether he was satisfied with investigation on the incident, he said he only knows that investigation has been assigned to CID and believed they would do the duties well as they had done during his period.
Replying to the questions about IGP he said we have to be concerned about ones post and not personally. We have had good IGPs in the past. When forces were engaged in war in the East and the North, police assured the security in other parts of the country. He also reminded about the then IGP who was ready to resign on an incident which happened in Katunayaka.
Various people have various skills-in singing, dancing but we expect nothing of these from an IGP, he said. (K. Budhika Kumarasiri)

They didnt want to court trouble!
	

The Green party Diyawanna group met for the regular stock-taking at the party chiefs official residence the other day.

While the members occupying the front row seats were dwelling on topical national issues one after another, two members in a back row were having an intimate chat of their own.
One of the duo had suddenly told the other: Machang, ask them when they are going to put an end to the accursed oil price formula.
I cant, Machang. You ask the question yourself! was the other members instant reply.
Thereafter, both had fallen into a silence as if they had started mulling over the issue. Presently the first member had opened again. Come to think of it, better not ask the question, Machang. After all, why should we get into unnecessary troubles by asking questions
The other had nodded assent.
However, some members had overheard the brief but interesting dialogue and had leaked it to the media.

UN chief warns of chaotic world order as General Assembly opens
	

AFP, 25th SEPTEMBER, 2018-UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Tuesday opened the worlds largest diplomatic gathering with a stark warning of growing chaos and confusion as the rules-based global order comes under threat of breaking down.
Addressing the opening session of the UN General Assembly, Guterres said trust in the rules-based global order and among states was at a breaking point and international cooperation was becoming more difficult.
Today, world order is increasingly chaotic. Power relations are less clear, Guterres told the 193-nation assembly just minutes before President Donald Trump was to take the podium.
Universal values are being eroded. Democratic principles are under siege. Guterres did not single out a country for criticism, but there are fears among UN diplomats that the world is being carved up into spheres of influence and a return to great power rivalry.
Trumps administration has made clear its distrust of international treaties, having scrapped the Iran nuclear deal, the Paris climate agreement and cut funding to the United Nations.
UN diplomats say the US stance has emboldened Russia and China to push their view of the global order in which human rights take a second seat to development and sovereignty rights.

Why public sector needs to be social media savvy
	

Sri Lankan public policy and public service have never been known to be moving with new trends. They are associated with archaic rules and regulations and snails pace work ethics. Now these very same institutions are faced with adapting to times when download speeds determine everything. Imagine the situation of a public sector worker, used to pushing paper, getting signatures and waiting for the office helper to move the file ten feet to the next clerk now having to deal with emails, Whatsapp messages and PDF documents. 
Some sections of Sri Lankas public sector are adapting to this and doing a good job at it as well. The Foreign Ministry has been one such agency that has paid concerted attention to working on social media. The spokespersons account is one of the most active of government workers and is constantly updated. 
Despite the inherent risks of using social media being amplified by the political nature of the Sri Lankan foreign service, the Ministry, I have been told does in fact encourage its officers to be active on social media. It is also one of the few government agencies that have tried to introduce a social media usage guide for its officers. 

Despite the inherent risks of using social media being amplified by the political nature of the Sri Lankan foreign service, the Ministry, I have been told does in fact encourage its officers to be active on social media

There are few government agencies that have been effective on social media like the Central Bank, the Office of Missing Persons, Secretariat for the Coordinating Reconciliation Process. But almost all of them are using these platforms to disseminate information. But social media is all about interaction. 
Why government bodies are slow to get on to the interactive part is probably due to lack of training and an absence of policy on how to use social media. Also, the fact that this government seems to be woefully lacking convergence on any one message is not helping the cause. 
But very soon this shift would have to be made as the public demands for quick action increases. The next generation of public officers would have to be trained on how to address public queries on Facebook, Whatsapp and Twitter rather than wait to write letters or even emails. 
All over the world social media innovations are revolutionizing the way age old tasks are being carried out. Take disaster response  now hashtags are being used to locate distress calls and provide information. Disaster repose units like the Red Cross, including the Sri Lanka Red Cross have been using social media to update information during disasters as well as gain information about damages and relief needs. 
The local twitter handle @road.lk, better known for its crowd sourced traffic updates also used its network during floods last year to direct relief andrescue missions. 
Now we come to the performance of one of key government departments on disasters management on social media  the Met Department. A close scrutiny of its twitter account showed that the last time it put out any weather updates on twitter was in April last year. Since then the account has continued to put out one tweet per week without fail. 
Last week this was what it said How many followers do you get weekly 10 awesome new followers for me! It is an automated ad on behalf of an app named Cowdfire which helps Twitter users to gain more followers. 

Why govt. bodies are slow to get on to the interactive part is probably due to lack of training and an absence of policy on how to use social media. Also, the fact that athis government seems to be woefully lacking convergence on any one message is not helping the cause

Before we get into why the social media account of an agency like the Met is vital to the nation, the first question is whether it is ethical for a government agency to be a PR forum for a private app provider. The Met Departments Facebook page does better, but only marginally. It puts up its daily updates on the page. 
But the twitter account is a classic example of how government agencies still lack the understanding on the value of social media, net hygiene and simple net etiquette.

Will support Govt. if it brings proposal to dissolve parliament: JO
	
We would support the Government unconditionally if it comes out with an early proposal to dissolve Parliament, Joint Opposition (JO) said yesterday.
Addressing a news briefing, JO member MP Shehan Semasinghe said the only option left open to the Government was to go for a General Election in order to resolve the prevailing economic crisis.
Economy is in a great jeopardy consequent to the continuous deprecation of Sri Lankan rupee against the US dollar and poor economic management. The people of this country cannot tolerate anymore. Hence, the Government should go for a Parliamentary Election, the MP said.
The Government is attempting to create a picture that deprecation of Sri Lankan rupee is not something unique to Sri Lanka because the other countries are also experiencing deprecation of their own currencies. Thats all rubbish, he added.
He said Sri Lanka was in a worse situation compared to developing countries like Zimbabwe and Ethiopia.
The Government should admit its incapability and handover the power to former President Mahinda Rajapaksa who is well capable of handling the economy in a more efficient manner. Mahinda Rajapaksa has proved that how well he has managed the economy under worse circumstances, he added. (Sheain Fernandopulle)
