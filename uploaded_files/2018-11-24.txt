A Pleasing personality - ?Sathi Acca?
	
Sathiyamalar Sinnappo, affectionately called ? Sathi Acca? is known to me intimately for over half a century. She was my lecturer at Palaly specialized Teacher College in 1965. She is also a relation of my wife. From Palaly she went on promotion to Kopay Training College as the principal and retired from there.??
My thoughts are crowded with memories of special moments. Words cannot do justice to her all-round capabilities and achievements. I can visualize her beautifully dressed, walking at a terrific speed, that?s her usual pace, no one can beat her in a walking race, walks into the lecture hall ?dead? on time for the lectures, that was her punctuality.??
It was mainly due to her high degree of discipline, dedication, devotion & commitment to duty that made her an exemplary role model as both a lecturer at Palaly G.T.C and later a Principal at Kopay Teachers Training College earning plaudits. She meticulously planned and executed whatever activity she desired to do at the training college.??
She enjoyed the blessings of all trainees, Co-lecturers and the supporting staff. Her loving, kind, innocent genuine smile will never be forgotten by her loved ones. She never grumbled or inconvenienced anyone. Patience, perseverance, and pleasing manners were her humble way of life. Generations of teacher trainees will treasure her in their hearts.??
Among the qualities she possessed, her loyalty to her family, her friends, her school, her church were bountiful. The hospitality she showed to any visitor whether at home or at college remained par-excellence. The affection she had for people was limitless. She speaks very courteously and her gentle words pierced anybody?s heart.??
She was the manager of the Anglican school - Chundikuli Girl?s College, Jaffna during the most critical days of the war, held almost all the key offices at the anglican church - St. James Church, Nallur, Jaffna and remained in readiness to help the poorest of the poor at all times. Her motto was ?help ever, hurt never, Love all, & serve all ? she lived true to her motto.??
Sad to say, she lived through her life as a worthy ?Spinster? Nevertheless she lived a contented life, she had more than a round dozen of nephews & nieces ? they were the centre of her universe, very specially ?Ravi & Jeyendran? who were the very ?Apples? of her eyes with whom she lived & to them she was ?the mother?. In fact she breathed her last at the entrance of the hospital in the hands of ?Ravi? while being rushed for emergency treatment. Beside these nephews & nieces, she also possessed the teacher trainees who passed through her hands an her own children & they in turn returned her the same love. That was the richness of her heart.??
Life is like a flower that blooms in the morning and withers away in the evening. Sathi Acca will be remembered for leading a harmless and inoffensive life, winning the friendship and respect of all those who came in contact with her.? ?
May her noble soul rest in eternal peace.? ?

Cambodian-UN war crimes trials finally over
	
?
Finally, finally, the over-long, 10-year trials of the leaders of the murderous Khmer Rouge leadership of Cambodia are over. The two defendants, Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan, were each given a life sentence at the end of the first trial in August 2015 for crimes against humanity. Last week, they were convicted of genocide.?
Of the other three who were tried, one, the ex-foreign minister, Ieng Sary died in 2013, one, Ieng Thirith, the wife of Ieng Sary, was too ill with Alzheimer?s to appear and one, Kaing Guek Eav (?Duch?), voluntarily confessed three years ago and was sent to jail for 35 years.
?
From 1979 to 1990, the US recognised Khmer Rouge as the only legitimate representative of Cambodia. Every Western country voted the same way as the US with the exception of Sweden
?
In the twentieth century, two massacres of hundreds of thousands people compete for second place after Hitler?s extermination of Jews, Poles, homosexuals and gypsies. One is Cambodiaand the other is Rwanda. But Cambodia, where the deaths were between a million and a half and two million and the executions around 500,000, carried out by Pol Pot and his Khmer Rouge, probably wins this ugly contest.?
A week after they took power in 1975, they forced as many as two million people living in the capital Phnom Penh to leave the city and work in the countryside. Thousands died during the evacuation. It was carried out in a hurried, ruthless and merciless way, forcing the inhabitants to leave behind all their possessions. Children got separated from their parents and pregnant women gave birth with no professional assistance. A majority of doctors and teachers were killed. The pogrom became known as ?The Killing Fields.??
?
Of the other three who were tried, one, the ex-foreign minister, Ieng Sary died in 2013, one, Ieng Thirith, the wife of Ieng Sary, was too ill with Alzheimer?s to appear and one, Kaing Guek Eav (?Duch?), voluntarily confessed three years ago and was sent to jail for 35 years
?
Khmer Rouge believed this was a levelling process that would turn the country into a rural, classless society. They abolished money, free markets, normal schooling, foreign clothing styles, religious practices and traditional culture. Public schools, Buddhist pagodas, mosques, churches, universities, shops and government buildings were shut or turned into prisons, stables, re-education camps and granaries.?
There was no public or private transportation, no private property and no non-revolutionary entertainment. People had to wear black costumes, work more than 12 hours a day and be married in mass ceremonies with partners chosen by the party. Showing affection to family members was forbidden. Intellectuals ? often singled out because they wore glasses ? were executed. If more than three people gathered to have a conversation, they could be accused of being enemies and arrested and even executed.?
Khmer Rouge ruled until 1979 when they were overthrown by the Vietnamese, their neighbours.?
Khmer Rouge then fled westward and re-established their forces in Thai territory, posing as refugees. Relief agencies including UNICEF were taken in and fed them, enabling them to fight another day.?
?
Samantha Power, formerly the US? ambassador to the UN, wrote in her book ?A Problem From Hell? that she did not find one US official who remembered reading the UN Genocide Convention to see if events in Cambodia matched its requirements
?
The US, still reeling from its defeat at the hands of North? Vietnam, acted on the old adage ?My enemy?s enemy is my friend.? Under President Jimmy Carter, the US in 1979, wanting to punish Vietnam, persuaded the UN to give Khmer Rouge Cambodia?s seat in the General Assembly. Ironically, Carter, who became President in 1977, had said he was making human rights the centrepiece of his foreign policy.?
From 1979 to 1990, the US recognised Khmer Rouge as the only legitimate representative of Cambodia. Every Western country voted the same way as the US with the exception of Sweden. The Soviet bloc voted against (There are cases of a country going unrecognised -- as with the US refusing to give diplomatic recognition to Angola in the 1980s. But Western nations wouldn?t even consider that option.)?
At the same time, many left-wing intellectuals and activists in the West also gave them support. They saw them as a clean communist broom sweeping out the old order.?
Samantha Power, formerly the US? ambassador to the UN, wrote in her book ?A Problem From Hell? that she did not find one US official who remembered reading the UN Genocide Convention to see if events in Cambodia matched its requirements.?
It wasn?t until June 1990 that James Baker, President George H.W. Bush?s Secretary of State, announced a change in policy. Later, the Big Five on the Security Council announced that Cambodia would become a UN protectorate. After labourious negotiations, the UN finally decided to set up a hybrid court with both Cambodian and international judges to put the Khmer Rouge leadership on trial.?
It is a good question as to why the Nuremberg court that tried the Nazi leadership should only take one year and this took ten, costing $ 300 million. During my visit in 2014 to the court, it was the defence lawyers who were dragging it out -- but the judges let them.?
Yet, a sort of belated justice has been done. Fortunately, we now have the International Criminal Court for trying crimes against humanity committed since 2002. It is a much speedier operation, though I would say still not fast enough.?

FIFTY YEARS OF PLANNED TOURISM IN SRI LANKA
	
?
Today the vision for Sri Lanka Tourism is to be positioning Sri Lanka as one of the most sought after tourist destinations in the world
Tourism has now been identified as an important component of the Sri Lankan economy, given its position as the third highest foreign exchange earner
The main tourist generating markets to Sri Lanka were India, U.K., Germany, Maldives, France, Russia, Australia
?
In May this year, Sri Lanka will be completing its 50th year of planned tourism. Although the influx of foreign visitors to Sri Lanka had started during the latter part of the British rule, Sri Lanka was known to travellers all over the world for many centuries. World renowned travellers such as Fahien, Hyun San, Iban Batuta, Marco Polo etc. had visited the country from time to time. Manthai or Mahathitthain Sri Lanka was the main seaport on the Ancient Silk Route from China to Europe.?
However, a systematic approach in planning and development of tourism in Sri Lanka initiated in 1966. Ceylon Tourist Board, the National Tourism Organization (NTO) in Sri Lanka was set up by a Parliament Enactment, namely Ceylon Tourist Board Act No.l0 of 1966, recognizing the economic benefits that tourism could bring to a country. Two years later, Tourist Development Act No. 14 of 1968 was enacted by Parliament to enhance the legislator of the Tourist Board for planning and development of tourism in Sri Lanka.? ?
The principal objectives of the Ceylon Tourist Board as set forth in the Act was:? ?
a) the encouragement, promotion and development of tourist travel;? ?
b) the encouragement, promotion and development of adequate, efficient and attractive tourist services;? ?
c) the doing of all such acts and things as may be necessary conducive to the attainment of the objects specified in paragraphs above.? ?
Today the vision for Sri Lanka Tourism is to be positioning Sri Lanka as one of the most sought after tourist destinations in the world.? ?
			
			Tourism is a force which if not planned & managed could have serious negative impact on environment, culture & society
			
		
The tourism industry in Sri Lanka has gone through good and bad periods over the past 50 years and the industry has survived from several turmoils and setbacks, showing its resiliency. First, it was due to the youth insurrection in 1971, then the Oil crisis. Secondly, ethnic conflict since 1983. Thirdly, terrorists attacks in the Colombo city in 1996 and Katunayake International Airport in 2001. Lately, Tsunami disaster which occurred in December 2004 also caused a severe blow to the industry. However, Sri Lanka tourism has shown its resiliency by the picking up of tourist arrivals no sooner the difficult situation ceased. Tourism has now been identified as an important component of the Sri Lankan economy, given its position as the third highest foreign exchange earner for the country. It is also making a significant contribution to the generation of employment and regional income.? ?
It is believed that the tourism industry in Sri Lanka is now well head up for a boom as the 30 year long civil war in the country ended in May 2009. For Sri Lanka, the year 2015 was the best with 1,798,380 tourist arrivals to the country which was the highest arrival figure reported so far. In the last year, the number of tourist arrivals was 1,527,143. Meantime, Sri Lanka is targeting 2.2 million tourist arrivals in this year which is the 50th year of planned tourism.? ?
At present, Sri Lanka Tourism has gone through restructuring process where with the enactment of the Tourism Act No.38 of 2005 by Parliament, the Sri Lanka Tourist Board was restricted to give away of its legal power to four newly formed tourism authorities such as Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority, Sri Lanka Tourism Promotion Bureau, Sri Lanka Convention Bureau and Sri Lanka Institute of Tourism & Hotel Management.? ?
The main tourist generating markets to Sri Lanka were India, U.K., Germany, Maldives, France, Russia, Australia etc. However, China is also showing signs of becoming one of the major tourist generating markets to the country.? ?
The country has benefited in many ways from tourism during the past 50 years. For Sri Lanka, foreign tourist arrival means an additional source of foreign exchange earnings which helps to lessen the adverse balance of payment situation. It also helps to diversify the main single crop (tea) economy further, tourism industry employs a direct work force of 112,550 and provides indirect employment opportunities to 157,600 persons making up a total of? 270,150.(SLTDA 2014). Tourism is contributing to the national income (GNP) directly through tourist expenditure and indirectly through the operation of the multiplier effect. Further, it contributes to the central and local government revenues by way of direct and indirect taxes & fees, making way for rural development. In addition, growth stimulus provided for underdeveloped sections of the economy e.g. Batik, Handicrafts, Masks, Lace, Gems & Jewellery etc. and has helped to revive of ancient arts & traditions i.e. Kandyan Dancing, Folk arts, Cultural events etc.? ?
In short, tourism is a force which if not planned & managed could have serious negative impact on environment, culture & society. However, if properly planned & managed, it could continue providing great economic benefits to the country, as it has done since 1966 under the guidance of Sri Lanka Tourism.? ? ?

Four killed as gunmen attack Chinese consulate in Karachi
	
The Chinese Consulate in Karachchi came under attack yestarday (Daily Mail)?
?
Four people were killed on Friday when gunmen armed with hand grenades and a suicide vest stormed the Chinese consulate in the Pakistani city of Karachi, officials said. The attack was claimed by a separatist group which branded Beijing ?an oppressor?.? ?
Pakistani authorities said that security forces had secured the area after the attack, the latest assault on Chinese nationals in the country, where Beijing has poured billions of dollars into one of the largest projects in its massive Belt and Road programme.? ?
China ?strongly condemned? the attack and asked Pakistan to take measures to ensure the safety of Chinese citizens and institutions in the country, as well as the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) mega-project.? ?
Three gunmen tried to enter the consulate in the southern port city, but were intercepted by guards at a checkpoint, Karachi police chief Ameer Sheikh told AFP.? ?
??They were carrying Kalashnikovs. First, they hurled a small (grenade) and then started firing,? said a guard at a nearby house who witnessed the attack.?
Police said two of their personnel were killed, along with a father and son from Quetta, the capital of Balochistan, who were seeking Chinese visas and were caught in the crossfire.? ?
At least one of the attackers was wearing a suicide vest which did not detonate, another senior police official said. Islamabad accuses its eastern neighbour India of funding and arming Baloch separatists, and of targeting development projects in the province, particularly CPEC.Delhi, which has denied the claims, swiftly condemned Friday?s attack.

FR against re-convening Parliament
	
The Supreme Court yesterday fixed for support on December 4 the fundamental rights petition filed against the re-convening of Parliament.
The Bench comprising Chief Justice Nalin Perera and Justice Lalith Dehideniya fixed the matter to be supported for granting leave to proceed along with the related petitions.
Former UPFA MP Sarath Weerasekara filed the petition seeking a declaration from the Court that the decision taken by the Parliament Secretary General and the Attorney General to re-convene Parliament was unconstitutional.
He said the SC had already issued an interim order staying the operation of a gazette proclamation issued by the President and that it could only be determined at the conclusion of the main matter and as such the petitioners in the applications are not entitled to claim the result of the final order from an IO.
However, Parliament Secretary General had made arrangements to reconvene Parliament on November 14.
Since Parliament continues to stand dissolved, neither the Secretary General nor the Speaker could summon Parliament before the final determination of the Court.
The Speaker was also cited as one of the respondents.
W.D.Rodrigo PC with Kaniska Vitharana appeared for the petitioner. Deputy Solicitor General Nerin Pulle appeared for the respondents. (S.S.Selvanayagam)

Greenhouse gas levels in atmosphere hit new high: UN
	
?
The levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, the main driver of climate change, have hit a new record high, the United Nations said on Thursday.??
Ahead of the COP 24 climate summit in Poland next month, top UN officials are again trying to raise the pressure on governments to meet the pledge of limiting warming to the less than two degrees Celsius, enshrined in the 2015 Paris accord.??
?Without rapid cuts in CO2 and other greenhouse gases, climate change will have increasingly destructive and irreversible impacts on life on Earth,? the head of the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) Petteri Taalas said in a statement.? ?
The Greenhouse Gas Bulletin, the UN weather agency?s annual flagship report, tracks the content of dangerous gases in the atmosphere since 1750.??
This year?s report, which covers data for 2017, puts the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere at 405.5 parts per million (ppm). That is up from 403.3 ppm in 2016 and 400.1 ppm in 2015.??

Massive development projects for Colombo Port: Minister
	
The Ports and Shipping Ministry will develop Jeya Container Terminal (JCT) of the Port of Colombo at a cost of US$ 25.7 Million (Rs. four billion approximately) by deepening it up to 15 metres, fixing three Gantry Cranes and extending the quay to facilitate two 350 metre ships at a time, Ports and Shipping Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe said.
?Cabinet approval has been granted to offer the contract to supply three Gantry Cranes to the JCT to Shanghai Zhenhua Heavy Industries Ltd. and the contract to deepen the JCT to China Harbour Engineering Co. on the recomendation of the Cabinet Appointed Procurement Committee (CAPC),? Minister Smarasinghe said.
Meanwhile, the Eastern Container Terminal (ECT) will also be developed as the deepest Container Terminal at the Port of Colombo enabling to berth massive ships, container carriers and oil tankers. In three other terminals at the Port of Colombo, Jeya Container Terminal (JCT) South Asia Gateway Terminal (SAGT) and the Colombo International Container Terminal (CICT) don?t have facilities to take big ships. After the development of ECT it will provide facilities to berth the largest ships in the world. Today?s trend is that shipping companies merge themselves to form large conglomerates and build huge ships, containers and tankers to transport large amount of goods and fuel.
Minister Samarasinghe said however, an MOU had been signed to develop the ECT with Indian funding but the government after convincing the Indian government on the necessity to keep the ECT under the SLPA had abandoned the project. The ECT will be developed with the funding of the Sri Lanka Ports Authority alone.
Minister Samarasinghe noted that the trend in the global Shipping Industry was to amalgamate middle and smaller cargo companies and engage in international cargo transportation using mammoth container ships and tankers that could transport several hundred thousand tons of fuel and containers.
?Our target is to meet the global demand in cargo transportation and make Port of Colombo, one of the major ports in Asia for trans-shipment and bunkering and cargo handling,? Minister Samarasinghe stressed. (Sandun A Jayasekera)

Accordingly, he said the Provincial Councils such as Eastern, Sabaragamuwa, North Central, North, North Western and Central had been already dissolved
He proceeded to say that going for either general election or presidential election was optional and it would depend on the prevailing state of affairs.
Meanwhile, he said the nominations for the presidential election should be called for on October 15, 2019 and it was due to be held on December 8, 2019.
?As it is evident, the recent Governments have postponed elections especially the Local Government election. But when it comes to the presidential elections, they can?t do so,? he added. (Sheain Fernandopulle)

Power of storytelling to create change
	
It is the show of shows and the greatest show on earth. On Wednesday, November 21, the United Nations marked World Television Day. In a statement, the world body says that news footage direct from the latest humanitarian crisis; documentaries putting a human face to crucial issues of our time ? human rights, peace, security and development; live coverage of the UN Security Council as it responds to global crises, and of the annual General Assembly when world leaders gather there.?
The UN?s video producers report from locations around the globe ? from peacekeeping missions such as Mali and South Sudan; from political missions in countries like Colombia and Afghanistan; and from the UN?s vast network of operations worldwide.?
Launched in 1947, UN Video is produced in the six official languages of the UN -- French, Spanish, English, Chinese, Arabic and Russian.
Highlights include an Oscar-winning short documentary on people with disabilities; an unprecedented Virtual Reality film on UN peacekeeping; and an urgent call for action on climate-change by UN Secretary-General Ant?nio Guterres, the UN says.?
In recognition of the increasing impact television has on decision-making by bringing world attention to conflicts and threats to peace and security and its potential role in sharpening the focus on other major issues, including economic and social issues, the UN General Assembly in 1996 proclaimed November 21 as World Television Day.?
World Television Day is not so much a celebration of the tool, but rather the philosophy which it represents. Television represents a symbol for communication and globalization in the?contemporary world.?
On November 21 and 22, 1996, the UN held the first World Television Forum, where leading media figures met under the auspices of the UN to discuss the growing significance of television in today?s changing world and to consider how they might enhance their mutual cooperation.?
Television was thus acknowledged as a major tool in informing, channelling and shaping public opinion. Its impact and presence and its influence on world politics could not be denied, the UN says.?
The history of television starts long before screens and broadcast signals, and its end is nowhere in sight. To fully understand TV?s history, we need to understand a bit of its etymology, which happens to be interconnected with its invention, according to a website.?
The Russian scientist and inventor Constantin Perskyl is credited with coining the word ?television? in 1900. The prefix, tele-, meaning ?at a distance? combined with the root, vision, perfectly described what he and several other inventors had created: a way to mechanically transmit and project images.?
The next two decades brought iteration after iteration of this groundbreaking technology. By 1928, the world?s first television station was launched in New York. Electronic TV quickly took over mechanical methods, and by the late 1930s, live broadcast had become a reality.
?
Since those early years, the word ?television? has applied to the entire invention?the transmission medium (or broadcast technology), the programme to be viewed, and the projecting/viewing device.?
The ubiquity of television and an influx of engaging, critically-acclaimed programming earns this decade the moniker, ?The Golden Age of Television.? Advertisers begin marketing products directly to consumers through TV programme sponsorship opportunities -- e.g. ?soap operas? sponsored by cleaning products directed at women watching TV during the day.?
In Sri Lanka, Television was first launched in 1979, and the first station was the Independent Television Network (ITN). Later the government set up the Sri Lanka Rupavahini Corporation. Today we have 38 channels telecasting a variety of programmes in Sinhala, Tamil and English.
Unfortunately, some of the channels do not live up to the values and principles outlined by the UN. Some even use the channels in a biased way relating to current news in support of different political parties. Another negative in Sri Lanka is the prime time given to melodramatic teledramas while important educational programmes for instance are seldom given prime time coverage. Also today, Sri? Lanka has smart TVs while hundreds of thousands of people watch TV programmes on their smart phones. So switch your TV on to be well informed, educated and entertained.?

Ready to form caretaker Govt. if UNP agrees: Lakshman Yapa
	
The government said yesterday it was ready to form a caretaker government with the United National Party (UNP) if it agrees on a general election.
MP Lakshman Yapa Abeywardena said their ultimate goal was to hold a general election.
?If the UNP is not in favour of going for an election when we are in power, we invite them to join us and form a caretaker government. Under a caretaker government which would be formed with the representatives of all parties, we can go for a general election. If the UNP agrees today, we are ready to do this without any conditions,? he said.
The MP said Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa would never object to an election and that he was not keen on holding on to the prime ministerial post.
?If the UNP and others want to appoint someone else as the Prime Minister of the caretaker government, we are ready to accept that. However, the President opposed to Ranil Wickremesinghe as the Prime Minister. Therefore, the UNP might have to look for other options,? he said.
Meanwhile, he criticized the conduct of Speaker Karu Jayasuriya and said the Speaker was acting with a ?common candidate? dream in his mind.
?Speaker Jayasuriya wants to be popular among the UNP crowd because he once left the party. Now is his chance to seize the opportunity and muster the support of the people to become a common candidate,? the MP said.? (Lahiru Pothmulla)

UNF and several other parties to form broad alliance: Rajitha
	
The UNF and several other political parties have decided to form a broad alliance and had decided on a new symbol, UNP MP Rajitha Senaratne said yesterday.
He said this during a media briefing held at the parliamentary complex last afternoon.
?We will come up with a new alliance with a new face and we thank President Maithripala Sirisena for destroying former president Mahinda Rajapaksa's political image and providing us with a suitable environment to form such an alliance," Dr. Senaratne said.
UNP Deputy Leader Sajith Premadsa when asked about the new alliance said he was not involved in the discussions to form a new alliance. ? The first priority will be to remove the present government which is ruling the country illegally,? Mr. Preamdasa said.
He said UNP Leader Ranil Wickremesinghe should be allowed to form a government after removing the present government and when asked whether Mr. Wickremesinghe had a majority to form a government, the UNP Deputy Leader said his party would show the majority at the right time.
When asked whether the UNP was ready to face a general election he said his party was not ready for a poll under the current political crisis. ?What will the MPs who created havoc in the House do if an election is called. They will use this kind of thuggery to win the election,? he said.(?Yohan Perera and Ajith Siriwardana)

Won?t quit if MPs vote down Brexit deal: May
	
?
UK, (Daily Mail), 23 November 2018 -? ?Theresa May today vowed she will not quit if MPs vote down her Brexit deal - as she dismissed Tory rebel claims that her package is worse than staying in the EU.??
The Prime Minister mounted another staunch defence of the settlement she has thrashed out with Brussels, saying it is the ?right? one for the country.??
In a BBC phone in, Mrs May warned that EU is not ?going to give us a better deal? if MPs vote down her settlement.? Torpedoing the plan will just lead to ?more division and uncertainty?, she said.??
Asked repeatedly whether she will resign if she loses in the Commons - as seems inevitable - Mrs May replied: ?No. I?m focusing on ensuring that we get this deal through Parliament?.??
More than half of Tory back-benchers have declared that they will vote against the deal.
