Ammas profound standards were respect, concern and friendship
	
Mrs. Monica Marion Phyllis De Alwis peacefully clasped the blessed hands of almighty God, though unexpectedly, after a life of 96 years on Thursday, April 6. She was the precious life partner of the late senior attorney-at-law Lucian A.P. De Alwis JPUM. Mrs. Monica De Alwis was the third of twelve siblings in the family of the departed well-known criminal lawyer Chevalier C.L.W. Perera and the late Mrs. Esther Perera of Kurunegala. Amma was the doting mother of five sons and six daughters. She was also the fond grandmother to twenty-five children as well as adoring great grandmother of fourteen kids. Amma was the doyen and matriarch of a wide and extended family circle comprising of Doctors, Lawyers, Engineers, Bank and Mercantile executives, Information Technology Professionals and Entrepreneurs. She hailed from a lineage of gentility and repute and was from a conservative ardent catholic background. Amma was always simple and humble, modest and elegant in attire, religious and zealous with no false airs. Her graceful and pleasing ways were the hallmarks of her interactions in society with relations, friends, clergy and colleagues. She was faithful and loyal to her late husband and supported him in all endeavors be it family matters, professional needs, solution of problems and in all aspects of living. They were close and attached to each other, heightened by understanding, trust and hope. The upkeep and upbringing of a large family were no burden to them. Amma actively joined Thaththa in providing the necessities and requirements of the family, ranging from nutrition, medication, clothing, counselling, education, music and sports. She maintained a spic and span household with order and decor. Her domain was of course the kitchen, where she prepared balanced and healthy food with care and attention. Ammas culinary skills were prominently displayed on important and significant occasions with a well laid out grilled and garnished table carrying sumptuous dishes. Featured among them was her appetising beef smore and the delicious seeni sambol. 
The highlight of the marriage of thaththa and Amma was the celebrations of their Fiftieth Wedding Anniversary in 1994 at the Mount Lavinia Hotel in the midst of the family, relations and friends, with joyful toasts and felicitations and bands and music, beginning with a Mass of thanksgiving. The golden era continued for a further five years and ended in 1999 with the demise of Thaththa. Consequent to her husbands death, Amma lived in prayer, remembrance and gratitude for eighteen long years with love, care and support surrounded by a grateful family. 
Amma nurtured a pleasant outdoor environment with the cultivation of exotic plants, paying special attention to flowering varieties. Befittingly her bier was adorned with clusters of varied hues of fragrant roses and dahlias. Her prowess with the needle was the exponent of a unique talent. Her nimble and swift fingers transformed colourful creations of embroidered handiwork which attracted the admiration of many for their execution, neatness and presentation. The image of Santa Claus impressed in thread on chair covers are still exhibited at Christmas. The bedspreads meticulously worked out in patterns of appropriate designs and motifs are still preserved as family heirlooms. 
Another aspect of Ammas profound standards were her respect, concern, friendship and assistance to others including orphanages and elders homes. It was in consideration of others wants as well as an acknowledgement of their success that she moved among people sincerely with ease and freedom not forgetting their birthdays and anniversaries. Amma also took pleasure in presenting gifts and memorabilia at appropriate times. Unforgettable are the splendid Christmas get-togethers when Santa Claus called our names to hug us with a present. 
Ammas departure from earthly shores marked an innings of accomplishments in Love and Fidelity, in Care and Concern, in Goodwill and Sincerity, in Charity and Assistance, in Praise and Trust in God. 
Thank you Amma for the memories you have left and for the good times we have shared. 
The obsequies were conducted by Rev. Fr. Bonnie Fernandopulle and Rev.
Fr. Sriyan Ranasinghe OMI. The mortal remains were laid to rest in her husbands grave at Mount Lavinia Cemetery. 
May Amma be at Peace

Australia to ship dairy heifers to Sri Lanka
	
West Australian cattle exporter Wellard will soon be looking for dairy heifers from Australia to fill contracts it has in Sri Lanka.
The company has sourced 2000 pregnant Friesian-Jersey cross heifers from New Zealand as the first shipment to fill a 20,000 head contract.
Wellard breeding and dairy general manager Colin Webb said the NZ shipment was timed to coincide with the completion of cattle handling and dairies being built in Sri Lanka.
Our next consignment will be sourced from Australia and we will be seeking similar categories of heifers once we start our Australian procurement program, Mr Webb said.
Wellard said the live cattle export program would help Sri Lanka produce fresh milk for the local market rather than rely on expensive, imported milk powder.
The company is also supplying nutrition, herd management, animal welfare, veterinary and milk quality advice as part of the contract.(The Weekly Times)

Consider garbage issue as essential service: Champika
	
The issue of garbage management should be considered as an essential service immediately and a separate authority should be set up to streamline garbage management, Megapolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka today said.
Addressing a news conference held at the ministry flanked by Deputy Minister Lasantha Alagiyawanna and ministry officials over the Meethotamulla mishap, Minister Ranawaka said local government (LG) bodies alone cant solve the garbage issue and therefore, it was vital to have a Central Garbage Management Authority to find solution to the issue.
He said people asked what role the Urban Development Authority (UDA) played when it comes to the issue of garbage and said it had none.
The UDA has no authority over garbage collecting or dumping. Its the LG bodies including the urban councils, municipal councils and Pradeshiya Sabhas which are legally bound to manage garbage. However, given the specialty, the Western province has its own Waste Management Authority, he said.
He said the UDA plays a role when calling for tenders from international firms and companies to implement projects to manage waste in the country as LG bodies are not allowed to call for international tenders. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

Customs seize 32,000 Lt. of Glyphosate
	
A large stock of 32,000 Lt. of Glyphosate which was banned to import to Sri Lanka was seized by the Customs Preventive Unit today, Customs Media Spokesman Dharmasena Kahandawa said.
During the investigations, the Customs officers had found 160 drums containing 200 Lt. Glyphosate. The stock had been imported in two containers from China by a vessel on March 15 by an importer who was identified as a businessman from Colombo 1, Mr. Kahandawa said.
The Glyphosate consignment was declared to the Customs as Non Ionic (Organic Silicon) in an attempt to mislead the Customs. The Customs Preventive officers halted the two containers due to the suspicious name of Non Ionic. After the probe, the Customs officers found that there was no Non Ionic in the container and that the consignment contains undeclared items, Mr. Dharmasena said.
Later several samples of the consignment were sent to the office of the Registrar of Pesticides Department of Agriculture in Gannoruwa, Peradeniya, which later confirmed the consignment was pure Glyphosate.
The consignee was released on a Customs bond and further action would be taken against him, according to Mr. Dhramasena.
While speaking to media at the Customs Grey Line 2 yard in Grandpass, Customs Director General Chulananda Perera said stern actions would be taken against such importers of banned pesticides to the country. Further investigations were carried out by the Chief Assistant Preventive Officer G. M. B. Gajanayaka, Assistant Preventive Officers J. G. A. Sanjeewa, S. V. Kamburugamuwa, A. V. P. Nalaka, W. G. C. S. Amarasinghe and D. L. A. L. A. Dassanayake under instructions from Customs Preventive Director R. A. J. Buddhadasa and Chief Preventive Officer V. Minuwanpitiya. Meanwhile, the investigation team led by Customs Director General Chulananda Perera.
Issuing an extraordinary gazette on October 23, 2015, the Finance Ministry said imports and use of Glyphosate were totally banned under the Import and Export (Control) Act as it was the major contributor to the Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) which is widespread in the country.
The Register of Pesticides had cancelled every licence that was issued for the pesticides containing Glyphosate as active ingredients, the DG of Customs said. (Chaturanga Pradeep)

Cycling from Colombo to England
	
Sixty-two years ago, Colombo-born Henry Merryl Fernando heard of a fellow Sri Lankans feat of riding a bicycle covering a distance of 11,000 miles. 
As a youth this seemed like a challenge to him, and he decided to someday attempt to break this record. As days passed he confided his wish to his best friend Ivan Rathnayake, who encouraged him in this endeavor. Henry was 20-years-old while his friend Ivan was 23. 
They planned their journey and decided to cycle 14,000 miles all the way to England. Their journey would last 14 months as per their itinerary. Before they began the arduous journey, they obtained the blessings of the then Prime Minister of Sri Lanka, Sir John Kotelawala. The Prime Minister also apprised the Sri Lankan ambassadors of the countries they would pass through during their cycling trip to render any assistance to the duo. 
Everything had been well planned. Two Humber bicycles were gifted to them by Sir Chittampalam Gardiner, a reputed entrepreneur in the country at the time. He also gifted them with Rs.1,000 each to meet expenses. They began their journey on March 3, 1955 from Colombo, obtaining the blessings of their parents, family members and a crowd of well-wishers. 
They expected to cover Colombo, Talaimannar, India, Pakistan, Iraq, Iran, Arabia, Turkey, Italy, Switzerland and France before arriving in England. 
It had taken three days for Henry and Ivan to reach Talaimannar. Thereafter they crossed by boat and arrived in India. From there Henry had to proceed alone in his quest as his friend Ivan stayed back in India. 
It was sheer determination and Henry never looked back or faltered although he was alone. He continued cycling through the great cities, basking in the cold weather, feasting his eyes on the colossal buildings in Europe and the breathtaking views of hinterlands. One could just imagine the challenges he would have faced when crossing the borders of Arabian countries and arriving in Europe. Having been educated in Colombo schools, his knowledge of the English language no doubt would have helped him communicate with strangers and explore these countries. He remembers how surprised he was to meet his friend Ivan when he reached Rome, although he did not join him the rest of the way to England. 
Henry cannot forget the difficulties he encountered in the Arabian deserts. Braving an unbearable climate and escaping the gangs of robbers who frequented the route, he finally arrived in England after 16 months of cycling. There may have been many other unforgettable incidents which are yet to be revealed by him. In one instance he remembers parking his bicycle by a wayside boutique in Afghanistan to have his lunch. When he returned, he was shocked to find that his bicycle had been taken away by some thieves. The news of his endurance and the plight he suffered in losing his only mode of conveyance spread all over that country and within moments he was grateful when the authorities presented him with a bicycle, with which he was able to complete his journey. There were news of his feat in most newspapers of the countries he passed through and even our sister paper, Sunday Lankadeepa at the time, carried a story of his untiring efforts. 
On arrival in the city of London, Henry was interviewed over the BBC radio on September 12, 1956 for six minutes. He was well received by the British citizens of that time who greatly appreciated his attempt. 
In London, he received the opportunity of joining the Royal Air Force and after training, was posted to Malaysia by the Air Force for his first appointment. Upon making inquiries, he found that he was given this opportunity as he was a Sri Lankan. He served in the Air Force until retirement and is now a permanent resident there. He married an Italian and is the father of four children who are also employed in England. 
He visited the island recently to meet his three brothers and spent a memorable time with their families. He hopes to get back to England soon. He was sorry to hear about the demise of his friend Ivan three years ago. 
Summing up his great achievement, he said I love the country where I was born. I had an aim in life and through determination and experiencing much difficulties I achieved my goal. In the decision I took with my friend, I was able to achieve that target and bring glory to my motherland but it was regretful to note that the authorities at the time did not bother to appreciate what I did. I believe that everything happens in life only for the good of that individual. 
In conclusion, he advised youth to give first place to believing in oneself. It gives you strength and once you begin your journey, your determination and dedication will carry you through life, he remarked joyfully.

Dumping garbage in Kradiyana; I was not informed: WP CM
	
Western Province Chief Minister Isura Devapriya yesterday said that he was not informed about the decision to temporarily dump garbage collected in Colombo at Karadiyana, after a section of Meethotamulla garbage dump collapsed recently.
Chief Minister Devapriya told a media briefing that he was not able to withdraw the decision since it has been already approved and added that the Colombo Municipal Council was only permitted to dump garbage just for few days at Karadiyana.
I was not informed of this decision by any related-party. But I am not concerned about it at this crucial juncture. It was reported that the residents of Karadiyana have also staged a protest yesterday against this move, he said.
He said that the decision to dump garbage collected in Colombo at Karadinaya was a temporarily decision and added that the residents should not get tensed about it. He also said that the dumping of garbage at Karadiyana would be immediately halted in the coming days.
This issue will not last for a long time. Each and every problem in this country will be solved exactly within two and half years, he said.
Meanwhile, he said that the Municipal Councils should be provided with the ability to reject garbage which has not been separated by the people to recycle. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)

Garbage dumps could be cleared after 3 years: WP CM
	
Western Province Chief Minister Isuru Devapriya today said there are about 25 garbage dumping areas in the Western Province and those areas could be cleared after three years if the government gives full powers to the Western Provincial Council.
Addressing the media at the SLFP Head Quarters, the Chief Minister said several tenders had been called for large scale projects for the initiation of garbage disposal in the Karadiyana and Muthurajawela garbage dumping areas.
The 25 garbage dumping areas were created due to the failure of not building the sanitary landfill in Meepe by the previous politicians, he said.
Special projects like garbage management had arrived to the country during the previous governments too and those projects had been stopped by the then oppositions, he said.
All we have left is signing the agreements for projects by the provincial councils. The Urban Development Authority had taken steps to hand over the Muthurajawela land area to an Indian Company. After initiation the projects we hope to send 500 tonnes of garbage from the Western Province to Muthurajawela garbage management project.
The remaining 500 tonnes of garbage will be provided to investors who have their own lands.
Accordingly, measures have been taken to solve garbage dumping issues in Colombo, Kalutara and Gampaha areas. To initiate these projects it would take at least two and a half years, or maximum three for the construction of the sites and to install the machinery. The Western Provincial Council also hopes to donate at least 50 MW of electricity to the main grid as a result of the projects.
Until the projects are initiated, we can dump the garbage in Karadiyana area. Likewise, if powers were given to nine provincial council chief ministers in the country, they can deal with the garbage and provide solutions to the country, Chief Minister Devapriya said. (Chaturanga Pradeep)

The Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) today threatened to launch a major trade union action within the next fortnight over the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM) issue.
GMOA Assistant Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge told a news conference that they were forced to resort to such a step with the governments continuous inability to provide a justifiable solution to the SAITM issue.
The government is always providing us with false solutions regarding this matter. Several trade unions including the Ports Authority, banking, electricity and teaching sectors have decided to join hands with us in this battle, he said.
He said discussions were going among these trade unions and the GMOA regarding it and added that they would announce their final decision about it next week.
He said this trade union action would highly affect the government as well as the people.
Meanwhile, GMOA Secretary Dr. Naveen De Soyza said they were still hoping for President Maithripala Sirisenas declaration on the SAITM that it should be nationalized.
The President will soon declare it since he has already decided to nationalize the Neville Fernando Teaching Hospital (NFTH). Perhaps, there can be political forces to pressurize him. But we still hope for a justifiable solution to this issue from him, he said.(Kalathma Jayawardhane)

India bans red beacons for VIPs from May 1
	
The Indian government decided on Wednesday to ban red beacons atop cars of all ministers, politicians and bureaucrats, ending a privilege that was seen as the ultimate status symbol.
The ban, effective from May 1, doesnt exempt even vehicles of the countrys top dignitaries such as the President, Prime Minister and the Chief Justice of India.
But ambulances and vehicles of the fire service, police, and army will be allowed to use blue flashing beacons to cut through traffic.
About six categories of beacons  primarily red, blue and yellow  are in use in India. But the red, or the coveted lal batti, has been drawing maximum attention as an elitist VIP symbol since the British rulers introduced it.
Road transport and highways minister Nitin Gadkari called the decision historic, and tweeted: Usage of red beacon tied us back to colonial legacy. With lal batti removal PM Narendra Modis vision of new India took a step forward.
The decision was taken at a meeting of road transport officials with the prime ministers office on April 15. The Prime Minister informed his cabinet about the move on Wednesday.
We have decided to remove the clause from the Central Motor Vehicles Rules, 1989, that gave the Centre and states the power to decide who should be allowed to display red beacons. The road ministry will shortly notify the amended rules, finance minister Arun Jaitley said.
The Centres move follows decisions by the Uttar Pradesh and Punjab chief ministers, Yogi Adityanath and Captain Amarinder Singh, to discard beacons from official cars in their states.
Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal took the lead in 2015 by asserting he would not have the red beacon on his car.
Union ministers such as M Venkaiah Naidu and junior home minister Kiren Rijiju have never used one since they joined the Modis council. Gadkari and Jitendra Singh, junior minister in the prime ministers office, removed theirs on Wednesday.
The opposition Congress welcomed the step, but took a swipe at the BJP, saying it was good to see the ruling party catch up with the progressive policies of the previous government.
The Supreme Court had given its verdict on December 10, 2013 about which cars be allowed and which ones not for use of red beacons. If after three-and-a-half years the BJP is trying to do politics over this and blow the trumpet of morality, then there can be nothing more laughable..., Congress spokesperson Manish Tewari said.
The top court called beacons atop cars of ministers and bureaucrats ridiculous and synonymous with power, and said these should be removed immediately. It advised the Centre and states later to amend the motor vehicles act to trim the list of people who can use beacons.
The road ministry had proposed limiting the privilege to five constitutional authorities  the President, Vice President, Prime Minister, Chief Justice of India, and Speaker of the Lok Sabha. The proposal was not approved.
According to the government, vehicles with beacon lights have no place in a democratic country.
People often saw these flashing lights as shining examples of power and VIP status, more than security aids. Even lower-level politicians and officials misuse the beacons to show off their importance, especially in smaller towns. (Hindustan Times)

Lankan woman in US wins car by kissing it
	
A 30-year-old Austin woman won a new car on Wednesday by keeping her lips locked on it for 50 hours.
Dilini Jayasuriya got the keys to a 2017 Kia Optima LX after winning a drawing that included the six other people who had finished the Kiss a Kia contest held by 96.7 KISS FM radio at Southwest Kia in Round Rock.
Jayasuriya, who is married and works in a state health lab, is a native of Sri Lanka. She said she and her husband were sharing one car since she had to give up on her 1998 Toyota Camry because it broke down too much.
Her husband, Ashan Panagoda, was at Southwest Kia Round Rock on Wednesday morning when she won the car. She called out to him, I want to go to the beach, before he gave her a big hug.
Jayasuriya said she was surprised to win. There were times she felt like giving up during the contest, she said. I had a couple of freak-out moments like something was in my eye, she said. She said she would then tell herself she could keep going.
The car Jayasuriya won is worth $23,108.
The other six finalists who had kept their lips pressed to two cars on and off since 7 a.m. Monday won a variety of prizes, including Austin City Limits passes and tickets to Justin Timberlake, Bruno Mars and the Chainsmokers.
The competition started with 20 contestants but most never made it to the end because they took their lips off the cars they were kissing, either because they fell asleep, got distracted or just wanted to leave.
The contestants had a 10-minute break every hour. They also were required to rotate around the cars they were kissing and had to spend time sitting and standing.
August Kostroun, a 36-year-old draftsman and designer from Round Rock, was one of the finalists. He said the friends and family who texted him during the contest helped him last until the very end. The hardest part was when it was his turn to sit down, he said, because he would lose circulation in his legs and get cramps.
The event drew national attention and part of it was filmed by ABC-TVs Good Morning America.
About 150 people initially entered the contest but a drawing narrowed that down to the 20 people who competed.
Anne Hudson, an on-air personality for the radio station, said she was not surprised that seven people lasted the full 50 hours. They were determined, she said. (mystatesman.com)

LOLC Life Insurance and General Insurance, now as two individual companies, have strengthened their position among the insurance players to reach the top 10 players in less than three years of operations. Our associate, Seylan Bank, now the fourth largest commercial bank in Sri Lanka, also achieved its highest ever net profit of Rs.3.8 billion. Thus, this year exemplified the perfect alignment of strategy and action.
Emboldened by this financial performance, we have been able to negotiate some key deals with foreign institutions, such as a landmark syndication where three LOLC group companies signed agreements with a group of international financial organisations to receive a loan of US $ 247 million, which included the largest ever syndicated loan in the local non-bank financial institution (NBFI) sector.
As part of these loan packages, we also received technical assistance (TA) programmes, which I am excited to announce will enable us to implement an environmental and social management system for the first time in the companys history, as well as a gender mainstreaming programme to empower and enrich our female clients and employees in the microfinance and small and medium enterprise (SME) sectors. Another TA programme played a key role in enhancing the capacity of some of our top-tier management, which culminated in an agreement to train 100 senior managers at the Frankfurt School of Finance & Management (FS) in Germany, as well as 120 of our senior executives by FS trainers in
Sri Lanka.
In terms of the leisure sector, LOLC was able to capitalize on favourable macroeconomic conditions and entered into a strategic partnership with Club Mediterranee, France (Club Med). This agreement gives LOLCs Riverine Resort in Beruwela a flagship status as Sri Lankas first Club Med property, with the collaboration boosting the visibility and strength of Sri Lanka tourism, with the potential to generate valuable employment opportunities within local communities. In line with the LOLC groups motivation to provide a wide range of services encompassing the tourism and entertainment value chain, we have also made strong inroads into the Maldivian leisure sector securing some of the most sought-after real estate in Male and
other atolls.
Closely following our strategic impetus to expand our multi-geographic footprint in microfinance, I can also announce that we are in the final steps of procuring our biggest overseas transaction with PRASAC Microfinance Institution Ltd.
Consolidating our commitment to driving sustainable growth, the LOLC group commissioned the first large-scale solar farm in Sri Lanka with a 10 MW power plant spanning 40 acres in Hambantota, called Saga Solar, which provides valuable support in easing the burden on the countrys national grid.
Capping off the year, the LOLC group was crowned as the overall Gold award winner at National Business Excellence Awards 2016, widely recognized as Sri Lankas highest corporate award, along with a number of other sub-sector awards in the Diversified Group and Hospitality and Tourism categories. This represented a source of renewed vigour and recognition for our young and dynamic team, who work tirelessly in pursuit of the groups overarching vision.
What does 2017 hold for the company and what do you see as potential opportunities
The strategic initiatives taken by the LOLC group have helped build a solid foundation to accelerate the growth of the company in years to come. We hope to prudently expand our reach in line with the national growth trajectory, as Sri Lanka grows into a middle-income nation. In terms of the non-financial sector, we will explore lucrative opportunities offered by the leisure sector through changes in the socio-economic climate, with more strategic investments in popular tourist destinations within South Asia. In Sri Lanka, I am looking forward to the completion of a five-star resort and spa property in Kosgoda, which represents a significant value addition to our leisure sector position. In the financial sector, the onus is on value addition and regional expansion in South and East Asia, with a particular focus on microfinance as it is broadly recognised as a catalyst in the countrys economic aspirations with vast potential and significant untapped market base. Armed with the strong LOLC brand, dynamic team, responsible practices like attaining the Client Protection Principles Certification for LOMC, LOLC Cambodia and PRASAC and the largest array of international funders in Sri Lanka, the future appears bright. We are particularly bolstered by the technical assistance project from the Asian Development Bank (ADB), where there will be an environmental and social management system implemented for LOMC and LOFC to monitor the sustainability impacts of our operation, as well as paving the way towards a gender action plan for greater gender equality within the company as well as clients. We seek to consolidate our position in rural Sri Lanka and presence amongst the urban poor, where we will strengthen our capacity by moulding operations to embrace value chain financing, employee training and tactical investment
in technology.
Could you elaborate on a few industrywide growth prospects going forward
The LOLC groups strategic plan is geared to align itself with the key growth sectors in the Sri Lankan economy and we are also able to enact this vision in a range of industries such as the more traditional primary sector industries such as agriculture, to service industries like leisure and healthcare, with our fully-fledged hospital in the Gampaha District. Given our experience and strength in microfinance, it bodes well for us that this particular sector has been identified by the government as a catalyst for growth  there is much untapped potential in the industry and we are looking to capitalize on the enhanced regulatory structure and increased competition to sharpen our approach and expand the quality and reach of our micro and SME portfolio. With shifts in nationwide mindsets towards energy conservation and favourable government policies, LOLC is also well set to expand on our renewable energy projects, starting with the establishment of our solar farm in the near future. In line with the growth projected in the economy, as well as rises in the per capita incomes, along with greater recognition for Sri Lanka as a top-quality tourist destination, we are confident that our investments in the leisure sector will stand us in good stead going forward.
In your opinion, what challenges do you anticipate in the industry and how do you intend to address them
In the face of the current trends and projected depreciation of the rupee, as well as changes to the regulatory structure, there is expected to be some level of hesitation in the investor market. Increased interest rates also add to the issue and there will be a steeper challenge with respect to sourcing low-cost funding to better serve our clients, especially in the micro and SME-dependent communities. However, LOLC has shown great resilience in challenging conditions and is well-positioned due to our agility and proactive strategy motions formulated, allowing us to focus inwards on optimizing our processes to ensure we remain on our high-paced growth trajectory. Anchored by the solid foundation provided by the ORIX Corporation of Japan, we will ensure our core business of financial services continue to thrive and are exploring the possibilities to leverage the group synergies through our diverse portfolio, helping smoothen the impact of fluctuating economic cycles and catalysing our core growth objectives.
Focusing on the shareholder, what efforts and initiatives are you taking to drive shareholder value
Displaying strong bottom line growth, LOLC is stronger today and better positioned than ever before to deliver long-term value to our shareholders, thanks to our commitment to continuous improvement and uncompromised execution of our strategies. We believe in a continuous learning process, which enables us to maintain our innovative edge in the industries in which we operate. With initiatives such as training programmes with prestigious international educational institutes such as the Frankfurt School in Germany, we are committed to enhancing strategic leadership skills, technical proficiencies and other such knowledge for all our staff to better serve our expanding client base. We are fine-tuning our risk management and asset liability management with the help of foreign consultants, with the first-ever dedicated training provided to the LOLC Treasury Department. This again, was possible due to the strong relationships maintained with our foreign funding partners, which is a key aspect we will look to further hone going into the future.
How has listing on the CSE been beneficial to your company
LOLC has been listed on the Colombo Stock Exchange since 1991 and this has enabled us to enhance our transparency to the stakeholders and standards of compliance with regard to corporate governance. We are now one of the largest listed companies in Sri Lanka, with a market capitalization of Rs.24.6 billion, which I feel is one of the key factors propelling the LOLC group towards its strong, sustainable financial performance. In acknowledgement of the value all stakeholders place on good governance and our commitment to withholding ethical principles, the CSE endorses these ideas and endeavours to embed appropriate practices in the processes and procedures of the company. This has allowed us to gain greater access to capital through the increased investor confidence and accountability ensured through the CSE listing, which has played an important role in attracting our wide array of international funding partners, many of whom now utilize LOLC as their preferred conduit to fulfil their development goals. The LOLC group has also benefitted from an increased presence and accessibility from a global standpoint, complementing our strategic goal of widening the companys international footprint.
Finally, what is your message to the shareholders of your company
Starting off as pioneers in leasing in the nation, the LOLC group has truly come a long way in a short time span. Today, we are not only able to enjoy a position as the largest NBFI in the country, but are also proud to rank amongst the key conglomerates driving the growth sectors of the economy. Most importantly, I am heartened by the catalyst role we have been able to play in inclusive, sustainable development, empowering and uplifting communities beyond financial solutions along the entire value chain. Our accomplishments and accolades would not have been possible without the invaluable input, support, patronage and loyalty of our employees, funding partners, regulators and our clients, so I would like to sincerely thank all of our stakeholders for their dedication to LOLC.

Malaysian HC rejects request to transfer SL envoys assault case
	
The Malaysian High Court today dismissed an application to transfer a criminal trial involving a Sri Lankan envoy from the Sepang court to Kuala Lumpur on security grounds, the Free Malaysia Today reported.
Justice Nordin Hassan said the grounds raised in the application pertained to law and order.
The applicant and the witness could complain to the trial judge and law enforcement agency if they are unhappy about a crowd outside the Sepang court, he said.
Nordin said the same crowd could be in Kuala Lumpur if the trial venue were to be shifted.
This is not a good reason to transfer the case from Sepang, he said.
Last September, three men were charged with rioting and assaulting Ambassador Ibrahim Sahib Ansar at the KLIA airport.
The unprecedented application was filed in January by the public prosecutor, with Ibrahim filing an affidavit in support of moving the court.
The application was made under Section 417 (d) of the Criminal Procedure Code for the High Court to grant an order for the general convenience of a witness.
Ibrahim said he believed that his safety was not guaranteed if he were to attend the trial in the Sepang Sessions Court as witness because large groups of Tamils had gathered there during the last two case managements.
He said he was still traumatised by the brutal Sept 4 attack on him at KLIA, a public area which should have tight security measures.
I fear for my safety and security if the trial is to be continued in Sepang, he said in the affidavit, adding that he had lodged a police report to express his concern.
He said he felt safer to have the trial heard in Kuala Lumpur as security measures there were tighter and better.
Ibrahim said Tamil groups had attempted to harm the staff of the Sri Lankan High Commission and a former prime minister at a Buddhist temple during his visit to Malaysia.
Lawyer M Manoharan, who is appearing for the accused  A Kalaimughilan, V Balamurugan and V Ragunathan  said today the case would be mentioned before the trial judge on May 3.
We will officially inform the judge of todays ruling to fix the trial dates, he said.

Meethotamulla: JVP to take action against those responsible
	
The Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) said today it was planning to take legal action against the authorities responsible for the Meethotamulla catastrophe alleging that the authorities purposely neglected the threat to the lives of residents despite repeated warnings of the danger.
JVP Provincial Councillor Sunil Watagala said they were discussing the matter with some Presidents Counsel about taking legal action against the authorities as it was a case of inflicting death due to negligence.
He said the penal code ordinance, criminal procedure code and the Urban Council Ordinance had been violated in this incident and the tragedy was caused due to the negligence of the authorities.
This is not a natural disaster. It is a murder caused due to negligence. When we visited Meethotamulla on April 11, we saw huge cracks on the ground and concrete floors and informed the relevant authorities such as the Disaster Management Ministry, District Secretary and Divisional Secretary. But they did not pay heed to our complaints. Causing death due to Negligence is a punishable offence under the criminal and penal code, he said.
Mr. Watagala said according to the Urban Council Ordinance, it was the duty of the urban council to collect garbage and dispose them properly.
He said the authorities could have taken action to prevent the possible threat to the lives of the Meethotamulla residents during three occasions when the fire erupted in the garbage dump and during the recent floods in the area. (Ajith Siriwardana)

Modi to discuss Trinco oil tank farm
	
Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi is to have bilateral discussions with the Lankan leaders on the sidelines of UN Vesak Day celebrations here, on matters of mutual interests and concern, including the proposal for joint development of the oil tank farm in Trincomalee, it is learnt.
Mr. Modi will arrive in the country on May 12 on a two-day visit in view of the UN Vesak Day Celebrations in the country. This is his second visit to Sri Lanka during his tenure. He undertook a state visit to the country in March, 2015, two months after the formation of the new government here. According to informed sources, Sri Lanka is the only country in Indias neighbourhood to be visited by him on two occasions. His 2015 state visit was also the first in 28 years by an Indian Prime Minister. 
Currently, the two governments have initiated discussions on the development of the Upper Tank Farm area of Trincomalee under a Joint Venture to be formed for the purpose with Lanka Indian Oil Company (LIOC) which is already using a part of the tank farm according to an agreement signed in 2003. Ahead of Mr. Modis visit, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe will travel to New Delhi for discussions. 
Asked about the current status of the project, LIOC Managing Director Shyam Bohra told Daily Mirror his company had refurbished the Lower Tank farm for Trincomalee Oil Terminal. He said he was awaiting the approval of the Sri Lanka government to develop the Upper Tank Farm area. 
During the past years, LIOC has submitted, from time to time, various proposals to the government of Sri Lanka for development of the Upper Tank farm but the same were not approved. Now, it has been decided at government level that the project shall be undertaken through a Joint Venture. Discussions are being held between the government of India and the government of Sri Lanka, he said. 
Responding to the query about the total cost of the proposed project, he said the rehabilitation of 84 tanks in the Upper Tank farm area, along with pipelines, Jetty and other ancillary facilities, would cost around US $ 300-350 million. 
The project will have to compete with ports like Singapore and Fujairah, and this requires meticulous planning and execution. Tanks will be developed in line with the requirement of Sri Lanka, he said. 
According to the agreement signed in 2003, the Tank Farm should be given on lease to LIOC for 35 years. (Kelum Bandara)

Racist customer spits in Lankan shopkeeper's face in UK
	
This is the shocking moment a vile racist spat in the face of a Sri Lankan shopkeeper in an off-licence - because she did not have the right brand of cigarettes.
CCTV footage shows thug Christopher James Callaghan abusing shop staff and then spitting over the counter in a woman's face.

Callaghan, 30, became angry when staff at Stanley Foods in Bootle, Merseyside, told him they did not have the brand of cigarettes he wanted.
After Nilani Nilalarajah opened the counter to prove to him that the cigarettes were out of stock, Callaghan hurled vile abuse at her and then spat in her face.
A furious Ms Nilalarajah threw an object from the counter back at the yob before calling police.
On Wednesday Callaghan appeared at Sefton Magistrates Court where he pleaded guilty to racially aggravated common assault in relation to the spitting incident on October 10 last year.
He also admitted a racially aggravated offence in relation to a previous incident in the shop, when he hurled racist abuse at Ms Nilalarajah.
The court heard that Ms Nilalarajah was 'disgusted' by Callaghan's behaviour and did not want him in the shop again.
Callaghan, of Roby Street, was jailed for 16 weeks, suspended for two years.
District Judge Miriam Shelvey ordered him to spend 35 days of supervision with the probation service, and to pay the victim <U+62E2>250.
The judge also upheld a restraining order which forbids Callaghan from contacting the victim.
The court heard he had a long criminal record, which included a racially aggravated offence in 2013.
Aksha Shahid, senior district crown prosecutor with the CPS, praised Ms Nilalarajah for being brave enough to come forward and report the offence.
She said after the hearing: 'This was a disgusting assault on a woman who was simply doing her job and providing a vital service to the local community.
'The victim was serving behind the counter at the convenience store in Bootle and Callaghan asked for a brand of cigarettes that the store didn't have.
She told Callaghan this but he wouldn't believe her and became abusive, calling her racist names and then he spat at her.
'We call this offending hate crime and it's often committed against victims that the defendant doesn't even know personally and is motivated by hatred of their race, religion or sexual orientation.
'The court accepted that this was a hate crime and increased the sentence by a year as a result.
'Callaghan was known to be an aggressive nuisance in the shop and he has now been sentenced by the courts for behaviour that will not be tolerated.
'The victim was badly shaken up by the ordeal but supported the prosecution and I'd like to thank her for her courage in coming forward and reporting the incident.
'There is also a restraining order in place to prevent the defendant approaching the victim or the shop for the foreseeable future.
'We hope this case gives others the courage to come forward and report this type of despicable behaviour.'(Daily Mail)

Sanath Jayasuriya is set to secure another term as Head of Cricket Selection Committee but the Board is looking at changes to the rest of the committee as their term will come to an end on May 1.
Jayasuriya and Cricket Manager Asanka Gurusinha, who was recently added to the selection committee will remain in their positions but the positions of the remaining trio hangs in the balance.
Cricket sources revealed that the Board is currently evaluating several candidates to be included into the selection panel. The names have been forwarded by the clubs.
We have got a number of names and we are currently evaluating them. But the biggest problem we have right now is their inability to dedicate time due to other commitments. Anyway, we will forward a list of names during the next few weeks to the Minister of Sports, a top Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) official said yesterday.
The current committee also includes former players in Romesh Kaluwitharana - a World Cup winning cricketer and Jayasuriyas opening partner, seamer Eric Upashantha and Head of Junior Selection Panel Ranjith Madurusinghe.Jayasuriya who resigned following the 2015 World Cup debacle returned to head the selection panel last May.
However, during his third term, the National Team suffered heavily while losing across all formats with the only high point being a 3-0 whitewash against Australia at home.
Sri Lanka also beat a second string South African and Australian sides in two separate Twenty20 series early this year.
During his previous term from January 2013 to March 2015, Sri Lanka won the 2014 World Twenty20 and a Test series in England before suffering a quarter-final exit at the 2015 World Cup.
His committee has also been criticised for lack of consistency in selection as they have tried out a record 44 players in One-Day cricket during the last 12 months.

SDB Bank-NEDA MoU to support MSMEs
	
Sanasa Development Bank PLC (SDB Bank), a pioneering financial institution founded on supporting the grassroots levels of Sri Lanka, recently signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with the National Enterprise Development Authority (NEDA) to further extend its support to the micro, small and medium entrepreneurs (MSMEs) in Sri Lanka.
The MoU primarily aims to encourage and guide the prospective entrepreneurs in the rural communities while further uplifting the existing business players in the MSMEs.
The NEDA, an institution established under the Industry and Commerce Ministry, currently serves the MSME sector with 235 development officers attached to the divisional secretariats, to elevate Sri Lankan enterprises to be an integral part of the economy.
Identifying the role MSMEs play in developing the economy of a country and the importance of empowering citizens to be self-employed, the NEDA has been actively involved in creating awareness among the rural communities about the boundless opportunities unveiled through entrepreneurial initiatives. The NEDA works with entrepreneurs to assist them in executing their business ideas and supports the progress of the business through continuous guidance
and monitoring.
While commenting on the MoU signed with SDB Bank, NEDA Chairman Omar Kamil said, This new partnership will certainly add value to the work being carried out by the NEDA currently as we now stand as a consolidated business development service provider to the prospective entrepreneurs in the country. We selected SDB as our partner in this instance as we identified them as an entity that spoke the same language as us.
Being a financial institution extremely receptive to the needs of the grass roots of our country, their goals aptly complement our vision. Moreover, as we both intend to widen the scope of the SME sector in the country, it was easy to venture into this business partnership and lay out
our objectives.
He further added, There is a range of services we will be extending to the MSME sector through this MoU. In addition to the financial support that will be provided inclusive of concessionary loan schemes with simplified terms and conditions, we will also collaboratively help the prospective entrepreneurs in rural communities with compiling business plans, business registrations and monitoring the progress of the business with constant guidance and training.
The NEDA has been conducting a graduate entrepreneurship programme since the year 2014, where 100 second-year students are selected every year and granted the necessary financial support and guidance to execute their business idea. Our partnership with SDB Bank will strengthen this programme further and help more graduates to venture into the MSME sector, which will considerably reduce the countrys unemployment rate and contribute to the progress of our economy.
We are also working collaboratively with SDB Bank on an incubator technology transfer centre in the Wayamba University, which will facilitate the research process required to test an innovative business idea. The necessary research equipment has been carefully chosen based on the industries in demand in the surrounding areas to optimize effectiveness of this project.
I strongly believe this collaboration between the NEDA and SDB Bank has the potential to reach greater heights in empowering the rural communities and uplifting the MSME sector by sharing our strengths and working
in synergy.

SL maid steals from Emirati sponsor, arrested 7 yrs later
	
A 35-year-old Sri Lankan maid who had allegedly stolen items worth Dirham 200,000 from her Emirati sponsor had been arrested upon her return to the country seven years later, the National UAE reported on Thursday.
The woman is accused of stealing three diamond rings, 10 gold rings, six gold earrings, seven expensive watches, clothes, bags, shoes, two phones, make-up items, food and Dirham 14,000 in cash in 2010.
The Emirati sponsor said that in June, 2010 she was abroad with her mother when her sister called from Dubai and said that the maid had rung up a huge phone bill with calls to her home country, Sri Lanka.
"When I returned to my home in Al Qusais, I cancelled her visa and sent her back home on August 13 that same year, but later started discovering several shipping receipts, all of which were made to Sri Lanka," said the sponsor.
The woman started checking her belongings and discovered a wide range of items are missing, so she called police.
Police tracked down one of the shipments and found that the defendant had sent an 80-kilogram package to her family containing clothes, shoes and other items.
They found a receipt issued by Damas to the defendant after she sold the jeweller some of the jewellery she is accused of stealing.
The maid was arrested upon her return to the UAE after taking up another job as a maid.
The 35-year-old denied the theft charge in court on Thursday. A verdict is expected on April 27.

Trump Armada to North Korea headed in wrong direction, US admits
	

An aircraft carrier the US said ten days ago was sailing to waters off the Korean Peninsula in response to Pyongyangs recent missile launches was in fact heading in the opposite direction, the US armed forces admitted Tuesday. 
The April 8 announcement that the USS Carl Vinson was cancelling a planned trip to Australia and was instead heading north from Singapore prompted speculation about a US pre-emptive strike on North Korea. 
US President Trump even told Fox Business Network, We are sending an armada, very powerful. 
However, on Tuesday the US Pacific Command said that while it had cancelled a planned port visit to Perth, the USS Carl Vinson and accompanying warships had in fact headed to north-west Australia to take part in planned exercises. 
The strike group was now heading north to the Western Pacific as a prudent measure, a spokesperson said. 
The confusion came to light after the US navy posted online a picture of the Carl Vinson passing through the Sunda Strait, the waters between the Indonesian islands of Java and Sumatra, on Saturday. 
The outlet Defense News first reported on the photograph on Monday, noting that the strait is around 5,400 kilometres from the Korean Peninsula. 
A Pentagon spokesman refused to comment on when the strike group, which also included two guided-missile destroyers and a guided-missile cruiser, would arrive off the Korean Peninsula. 
However Defence Department officials cited by the New York Times said the carrier was expected next week.
