	The government hopes to mete out justice to those held in prison under the Prevention of Terrorism ACT (PTA) before the end of the year, Justice Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe assured the prisoners who are currently on a hunger strike calling for their release.
	The Minister who visited the prisoners who were on a hunger strike at the Magazine prison this morning also assured that the government had already begun a process to repeal the PTA and replace it with another legislation to prevent terrorism.
	Responding to a question as to whether the prisoners accepted the assurance given by him, Mr. Rajapakshe said some had accepted while some were continuing with the hunger strike.
	More than 150 prisoners are on a hunger strike in Anuradhapura, Bogambara, Jaffna, Colombo and Batticaloa while six prisoners in the Magazine prison had been admitted to prison hospital while the condition of one inmate in Anuradhapura is reported to be serious.

Video: Hearing postponed after MR?s protest
	
	The public hearing into the ITN controversy fixed for today by the Presidential Commission of Inquiry to Investigate and Inquire into Serious Acts of Fraud, Corruption and Abuse of Power, State Resources and Privileges (PRECIFAC), was postponed for tomorrow.
	The hearing was postponed after the lawyers representing former president Mahinda Rajapaksa raised four matters including the legality of PRECIFAC and the appointment of high court judges to it.
	Minister Susil Premajayantha said the investigations into the allegations would continue after the ruling on the points raised by Mr. Rajpaksa?s lawyers was revealed today.
	Former president Mahinda Rajapaksa, who attended today's hearing, told the media that the advertising agencies had paid the monies owed to the ITN and that the party should be held responsible because it was the party which had selected agencies.
	He said these allegations were being levelled against them as a means of taking political revenge and thus covering up the government?s failure.
	?They act like we have done nothing for the county by giving the impression that they are the ones who have done everything. We are being attacked to cover up the government?s failure. They are betraying the security forces and so far four retired security forces' commanders have been questioned up to now,? Mr. Rajapaksa said.
	Meanwhile, Mr. Rajapaksa's media secretary Rohan Welivita in a statement said Mr. Rajapaksa appeared before PRECIFIC in response to a letter sent to him over five allegations being currently investigated by it.
	He said one of the matters under investigation was the appointment of Anura Siriwardene as the Chairman/CEO of Independent Television Network (ITN) at a time when there were no vacancies for that post.
	Mr. Welivita said the appointment was not directly made by Mr. Rajapaksa but by the Treasury Secretary because the Treasury owns the majority the shares of ITN and that the appointment had been made after the former Chairman had resigned.
	Mr. Welivita said the second matter was about the non-payment of outstanding bills owed to the ITN. But the ITN in a letter dated January 27, 2015 claimed that the outstanding amounts had been settled by the Media Factory in full.
	He said a financial loss of Rs.24 lakhs allegedly caused by an advertising firm known as ?Special Solutions? not paying its dues to ITN was the third matter under investigation. But in this instance too the outstanding amounts due to ITN had been paid by this advertising firm.
	The fourth was the non-telecasting of the then presidential candidate Maithripala Sirisena?s paid advertisements was an internal administrative matter of the ITN.
	Mr. Welivita said all matters connected to the campaign advertisements were handled by the candidate's political party or alliance and as such these matters were not the responsibility of the candidate but of the relevant political party or alliance. (Ajith Siriwardana)

Insurance vital for sustainable national pension framework: AIA CEO
	
From left: Pensions Department Director General Sunil Hettiarachchi, AIA Sri Lanka CEO Shah Rouf, Verite Research Executive Director Dr. Nishan De Mel, J B Securities CEO Murthaza Jafferjee, Institute of Policy Studies Research Fellow Dr. Nisha Arunatilake, Prof. Indralal De Silva of University of Colombo and Moderator Nalaka Gunawardena
AIA CEO Shah Rouf was among the distinguished pensions experts who participated in the panel discussion titled ?Towards a National Pension Framework?, moderated by Nalaka Gunawardena - science writer, journalist and development communication specialist. National Pensioners? Day 2015 was initiated by the Pensions Department with background presentations and a panel discussion as part of the forum?s sessions. ?
The presentations were by Prof. Indralal De Silva Professor of Demography University of Colombo, Dr. Nisha Arunatilaka, a research fellow at the Institute of Policy Studies and Murthaza Jafferjee, CEO of JB Securities. Apart from Shah, the discussion panel included Dr. Nishan De Mel, Executive Director and Head of Research at Verite Research, a think tank, and the Director General of the Pensions Department, Sunil Hettiarachchi.
Prof. De Silva spoke on demographic trends highlighting that life expectancy has risen from 32 years for males in 1920 to 68 in 2002 and 72 today. The elderly population is doubling and more females are living longer. Dr. Nisha Arunatilaka began her presentation with the question, ?Have you thought about your retirement planning today?? She then pointed out that there is a need to change fiscal policies because in other Asian countries the retirement age is higher while Sri Lankans are retiring prematurely and living longer, making a case for raising the retirement age. ?She also pointed out that not even half the female population is in employment and therefore are not entitled to get the Employees? Provident Fund (EPF). Also, 50 percent of senior citizens do not receive a pension and only about 20 percent get a government pension. ? ??
Adding to Jafferjee?s presentation on the four-pillar ?ideal? pension system ? where Pillar 1 is a universal minimum state provided pension, Pillar 2, is a mandatory pension for all (similar to but not same as the EPF), Pillar 3 is a voluntary pension (such as those provided by life insurance companies) and Pillar 4 other incentivised savings that can be drawn upon ? Shah commented that these systems had evolved over time in South America and Eastern Europe in the 1980s and 1990s so there were good templates for Sri Lanka to consider.
With AIA, fast becoming recognized as one of the country?s ?pension experts?, Shah emphasized on the importance that life insurers play as Pillar 3 and 4 providers in a sustainable pension framework. ?We must understand that we are personally accountable for our retirement,? said Shah.?
Shah further commented, ?Even the most advanced sustainable national pension systems can only provide a very basic income and in most cases even that is ?means tested? for the very needy. In such systems the middle classes are encouraged to accumulate funds such as EPF and other long-term savings such as life insurance endowment policies to build up their pension fund. Whether within a framework that incentivises saving for a pension or not, individuals have little choice but to take ownership of their own retirement planning.??

Video: Peacekeeping forces boosting SL image: Brigadier
	
Sri Lanka has deployed nearly 255 Army, Navy and Air Force personnel in several countries -- in the Middle East, Africa and Oceania -- under the UN?s Peace Keeping Operations and that has led to create an extremely positive impression among the global community, particularly among UN member countries regarding Sri Lanka?s armed forces, Army spokesman Brigadier Jayanath Jayaweera said.
Addressing the weekly Cabinet news briefing today Brig. Jayaweera said : ?We have deployed our armed forces personnel in Haiti, South Sudan, Lebanon, Congo, New York, Western Sahara, Central Africa etc and they are doing a good job drawing praise from the UN and the respective governments of the countries they serve in. Therefore, deploying more Sri Lankan armed forces personnel in peace keeping will not be a difficult task.?
He said Sri Lanka?s armed forces personnel were attending to various difficult duties in the countries they served in, varying from combat duty, engineering, transport and relief supply, and added the Sri Lanka Army personnel deployed in Haiti during the 2010 earthquake had been highly commended for their performance.
He said the good name earned by the Sri Lankan Armed forces came as a result of the positive and pragmatic diplomacy initiated by President Maithripala Sirisena, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and Army Commander Crishantha De Silva in the past few months.
Brigadier Jayaweera said that, for over five decades, Sri Lanka had been making modest contributions to UN peacekeeping efforts, and two Combat Transport companies, one Field Engineering company, one Plant Engineering company, three Infantry battalions, two Special Forces companies and one Combat Field Engineering company were on standby in Sri Lanka for future peace keeping operations of the UN.?

Ravi Abeysuriya to transform capital market expansion
	
		 		 
		 
			
Ravi Abeysuriya, the new President of the Colombo Stockbrokers? Association (CSBA), said that the industry has great potential to grow as we have a lot of catching up to do when compared to our regional peers.?
?From one end people need to move towards a culture change to graduate beyond merely saving to investing,? said Abeysuriya.?
On the other hand, listed corporates should further improve on governance aspects to attract savvy investors to participate in the growth of their companies than depending on only bank borrowings. The market intermediaries such as the stockbroking firms and asset managers need to take greater responsibility to ensure a larger number of our population who hitherto are not benefiting from our market directly or indirectly participate in our capital market. ?
?
?Our industry is at a crossroad, largely because investors no longer see the value the industry brings to society and only a meaningful change can restore that trust,? he said. When investors do not trust the stock market, they are unlikely to save and invest for their future and achieve their long-term financial goals. The problem is not the stock market; rather it is the minority of people who have aided to cut corners and incorrectly advised clients on reckless practices when trading for short-term gain. ??
Sri Lanka, being one of the fastest aging countries in the world, Abeysuriya stated, ?There will be a massive social impact to Sri Lanka in the not too distant future unless they start investing. People will have lower quality of life and may have to work longer and will have intergenerational stress.?
Whilst better regulation and enforcement of regulation is required, robust governance requires a focus on ethical culture within financial firms such as stockbrokers and asset managers. To restore trust, we need a shift towards greater integrity and accountability. We need a stronger and systematic ethical dimension. Getting back on the right path requires education and leadership that is sustained over many years.
?Most importantly, it requires investors and financial leaders taking ?values? as seriously as ?valuation? and ?culture? as seriously as ?capital?. Our industry players should serve the interests of our clients for the common good of humanity. We, as an industry, need to become more professional and sell a service and not a product,? he added. ?
The stock market in Sri Lanka is under-owned versus other frontier market peers and as a result, people in Sri Lanka miss out on the ?power of investing?, particularly to build long-term savings for retirement. He said long-term institutional funds such as provident funds, insurance companies and unit trusts collectively own only 6.5 percent of the Rs.3.1 trillion stock market capitalization. Similarly, only 6 percent of Rs.133 billion AUM of unit trusts is in pure equity funds in Sri Lanka and only about 25,000 CDS accounts are active.?
?The stock market offers the means to participate as an owner in the growth of the companies that make up the Sri Lankan economy. What makes it powerful is that companies are motivated to grow their businesses over time. Stock ownership is the way for individuals to participate in that growth. Of course investing takes optimism about future opportunities. It requires investing wisely, taking a reasonable amount of risk and a long-term view and most importantly getting professional help,? Abeysuriya said.
Abeysuriya is the Director/CEO of Candor Group of Companies, a Fellow Member of the Chartered Institute of Management Accountants, UK, a Chartered Financial Analyst, USA and has an MBA from Monash University, Australia.?
He functioned as a permanent member of the Financial Sector Reforms Committee (FSRC), a Prime Ministerial Task Force appointment by Prime Minister Ranil Wickramasinghe. He was also twice appointed as a commission member of the Securities and Exchange Commission of Sri Lanka and was a Director of Sri Lanka Insurance and Chairman of the Investment Committee and was also the former President of CFA Sri Lanka, President of ITESA and Vice President of SLASSCOM.
The Colombo Stockbrokers? Association is an apex industry body, representing the stockbroking companies licensed and regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission of Sri Lanka. ?

	A young female doctor (25), serving at the Chilaw District Hospital, had suddenly fallen ill while on duty and had passed away after admission to the same hospital on Wednesday (14) night.
	The deceased had been temporarily residing in Chilaw. Her parents were said to be living in Saudi Arabia and she was living with a relative living in Mt Lavinia at present.
	It is revealed that she had reported for duty Wednesday morning and had eaten her lunch at the hospital canteen. This fact was confirmed by the nursing staff, who had observed that soon after she had eaten her lunch she had fallen ill. She was rushed to the hospital thereafter. However she had passed away the same night.
	Investigations revealed that the female doctor was not the first person to have a bad reaction to food eaten at this particular canteen that was maintained at the hospital mainly for doctors and medical staff. It was suspected that the food consumed by the young doctor may have caused her death.
	An inquiry was to be held to ascertain the cause of death as well as who was to blame for this tragedy. Chilaw police were conducting further investigations. (Augustine Fernando)

Social Empowerment and Welfare Minister S.B. Dissanayake today said that if good counselling had been more prevalent, a case like that of Kondaya, who was suspected for Seya Sadewmi?s murder, could have been prevented.
Speaking at the National Counselling Day celebration at the Sri Lanka Foundation Institute, the minister requested for a more science-based counselling to be taught to village elders such as Buddhist monks and parish priests so they could provide relief at the village level.
He explained the importance of counselling referring to the murder of Seya.
?Take the case of Kondaya. He was in the forest, lived there. This should have come into the notice of our officials, the head monk of the village, or if it a catholic area; the parish priest or police. A man like this was living in the neighbourhood but was not attended to. They have failed a very important social responsibility.?
?A lot of talent is out there in the village; our field workers should go and find them. Like we found Susanthika and Dasun,? Minister Dissanayake further added, ?Kondaya might have had many skills and talents that we didn?t get to realise.? (Dinali Jayasuriya)WATCH

	The government has gathered information on eight Dollar Accounts held in foreign banks by members of a VVIP family of the previous regime and the names of account holders will be disclosed after the ongoing investigations are over, Cabinet Spokesman and Minister Rajitha Senarathe said today.
	He told the media at the weekly cabinet news briefing that in one account they had deposited US$ 1.86 billion,US$ 1.8 billion in another and US$ 500 million in yet another account.
	When a journalist demanded Minister Senaratne to disclose the names of those allegedly held illegal dollar accounts in the banks in foreign countries, he declined and said it would affect the investigations.
	Responding to a statement made by a member of a VVIP family disowning the dollar accounts, Minister Senaeratne said no one should jump the gun if they were innocent but vowed to disclose the names of account holders at the right time and also to bring them before the law on charges of money laundering and plundering of state resources.
	Minister Senaratne appealed to the media not to give publicity to the investigations on illegal dollar accounts held by Sri Lankans as it would hamper the inquiry and added a few countries had expressed concerns on certain local media reports recently.
	?Many countries have flexible legislations to deal with black money deposited in overseas banks. Only countries like Monaco have strict rigid laws on this matter. Therefore, Sri Lankan sleuths do not find the task impossible and they are confident that they would trace all illegal dollar accounts held by Sri Lankans and those who held them before long,? Minister Senaratne stressed.
	He added that the US Federal Reserve (USFR) was assisting Sri Lanka in the investigations as the USFR had data on each and every dollar account held in any bank in anywhere in the world. (Sandun A Jayasekera)
