An uphill climb on steps of glory
	
Twenty five years of success. The beginning of it all was the dream of a single individual, Mohan Lal Grero. His dream of a Sri Lankan student population proficient in the English Language became a reality with the establishment of the Lyceum International School on June 14, 1993. The dream developed into his Vision and then into his Mission, and the Mission of the school is To enhance the potential of every young soul that passes through our halls, empowering them to be the best they can do.
It seemed then a mission impossible. In reality, however, in proved to be quite possible. As a teacher, who joined the school on September 6, 1993 with the opening of the Primary School and yet works as an AL teacher for the Upper School of Lyceum, I have observed the transition over the years and can now very sincerely state that this mission has been, in every sense of the word, fulfilled. 
Today we boast of 8 branch schools established in diverse parts of the country, namely Kandana, Panadura, Wattala, Ratnapura, Gampaha, Nuwara-Eliya, Anuradhapura and Kurunegala. The significant fact about it all is that equal attention and supervision is maintained with respect to all these branch schools to keep up the standards of every one of them. 
The methodical nature and the meticulous attention given to detail, by the Founder of our school Mr. Mohan Lal Grero and his wife the Principal of the school Mrs. Kumari Grero (a very diplomatic lady indeed), I am by no means surprised.
Lyceum International School which began with the Nursery and Pre-Grade on June 14, 1993 rose up to the AL Commerce and Science streams in its very first two years. Students of all religions were given time for study and prayer. Discipline was maintained to the maximum. And the little-known Lyceum gradually grew into a much sought-after International School. Currently, Lyceum has both National and Cambridge AL and OL streams. Extra-curricular activities were added on. Sports such as Cricket, Basketball, Netball, Soccer, Swimming, Badminton etc. received a very special place. Public Speaking was given a very special place and made part of the school curriculum from Grade 1 itself. 

Students of all religions were given time for study and prayer. Discipline was maintained to the maximum. And the little-known Lyceum gradually grew into a much sought-after International School.

We now have our own Broadcasting and Media Clubs as well and our very special Channel 100.8. Lyceum FM was launched to celebrate the 25th Anniversary of Lyceum Nugegoda. 
Academic excellence naturally comes first. Our father figure Aristotle has given us our school motto: Know Thyself. Our students have amply shown that they certainly have come to know themselves. 
The past 25 years have produced an impressive number of nearly 200 Edexcel and Cambridge Award Winners. Almost 150 out of them have been Top in Sri Lanka Awards and 19 Top in the World Awards. 
The A/L Top in the World Awards have been in the subjects Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Accounting, Computing and Business Studies at both Edexcel and Cambridge International Examinations. Top in the World Awards at O/L Edexcel and Cambridge Exams have been in French, English Literature, Biology, Computing, Human Biology and Maths. The highlight of our Awards came in the year 2006 when three Cambridge O/L students from the same batch won Top in the World Awards in the subject of English Literature --- a record yet unbroken in Sri Lanka. 
Lyceum International School provides ample opportunities for the development of the natural talents of all children. Every kind of sport is available in the school and our students have excelled in all of them. Also, the large number of clubs and societies in existence in the school allows the child to choose which field it is that most interests him. 
A team from Lyceum organised and trained by the English Literary Association (ELA) won the All Island Shakespeare Challenge Trophy in the year 2009. The ELA also held two unequalled variety shows Sub Zero and Ecstatic in 2012 and 2014 spotlighting solely Lyceum student talent. The Lyceum Model United Nations, besides winning many awards, represented Sri Lanka at the World Young Leaders Summit in Washington D.C. The dream has indeed become a beautiful reality. The next question is quite natural. What of the future Yet again, is that a question The Founders son Nikitha Grero and daughter Nardhya Grero are already engaged in the issues of the school. Nikitha, in addition, is a Director and Deputy Coordinating Principal of Lyceum as well as the Principal of the Kurunegala Branch. They would undoubtedly carry on the wonderful work of their parents and keep the flag of Lyceum soaring upwards.

Our prayers are with Lyceum.

CERT receives 1,100 fb complaints, 10 businessmens emails hacked
	
The Computer Emergency Readiness Team/Co-ordination Centre (CERT|CC) had received 1,100 complaints regarding social media issues and ten complaints on fraudsters attempting to hack email accounts of businessmen and lure them into making remittances since January this year, Principal Information Security Engineer Roshan Chandragupta said.
He said that facebook users must take extra care to ensure their safety and security on cyberspace, especially when publishing their photographs, he said.
It is safer to publish photos under the friends only category, he said.
Users of fb should keep in mind to add only those personally known to them and to avoid accepting friend requests from those of unknown origin, Mr Chandragupta said.
He said CERT had reported most cases to Facebook Headquarters. Mr Chandragupta said most of the complaints were made by genuine users of Facebook accounts, saying that their names and photos were used to create fake Facebook accounts.
Meanwhile, Mr Chandragupta said ten people had fallen prey to one of the latest scam techniques, where peoples accounts were hacked. He said these individuals were requested to change their bank account details.
Mr Chandragupta requested people to be vigilant about what was said during email conversations and to update usual contacts with the recipients home telephone numbers.
There were some who felt suspicious over incoming emails. They had made telephone calls to the relevant recipients or the companies about the suspicious emails and managed to save their money, he said.
People should keep in mind to read the contents of their emails. The email addresses cannot be duplicated but making small changes such as changing a letter can make email addresses look similar to the original, he said.
Mr Chandragupta said some people checked their emails after the goods ordered were not received and called the telephone numbers they had contacted earlier, only to realise that they were hoax numbers and that their money was gone for good. (Chaturanga Samarawickrama)

Crime of the century; 152 million child labourers : EDITORIAL
	
World spiritual leaders have warned us that those who abuse children or indulge in child labour would and should be thrown into the deepest ocean with a millstone tied rounds their necks. Children are devastatingly honest and innocent that is why the heavenly realms comprise people who have the honesty and innocence of children. Seen in this light many of our leaders -- political, social, business and even religious leaders -- appear to be sadly lacking in honesty, innocence and a spirit of sincere, sacrificial and selfless service to the people, especially those caught in the poverty trap of a wicked world. Therefore such leaders face a fate that is too horrible to be imagined. 
June 12, was the World Day against Child Labour. According to the Indian Express group some 152 million children are caught up in the torture of child labour with some 73 million being forced to get involved in hazardous work.
The United Nations, which mark this day worldwide is calling for an end to the brutalities of child labour. Despite the efforts made by NGOs and governments, the plight of illegal young labourers is a reality of society that we live in and we need to confront it with all the power at our disposal.
According to the UN, in 2002, the International Labour Organization (ILO) launched the World Day Against Child Labour to focus attention on the global extent of child labour and the action and efforts needed to eliminate it. Each year on June 12, the World Day brings together governments, employers and workers organizations, civil society and millions of people from around the world to highlight the plight of child labourers and what can be done to help them.
In a message, ILO Director-General Guy Ryder says Children are more vulnerable to risk than adults. It is a priority in the wider ILO campaigns against child labour and for safe and healthy work for youth of legal working age  Generation Safe and Healthy . The child labourers are toiling in mines and fields, factories and homes, exposed to pesticides and other toxic substances, carrying heavy loads or working long hours. Many suffer lifelong physical and psychological consequences. Their very lives can be at risk. 
No child under the age of 18 should perform hazardous work as stipulated in the ILOs Conventions on child labour, namely the Minimum Age Convention, 1973 (No. 138) and the Worst Forms of Child Labour Convention, 1999 (No. 182). They require governments, in consultation with social partners, to establish and enforce a national list of hazardous work prohibited for children. Ratification of these Conventions by 171 and 181 ILO-member States respectively -- close to universal ratification  reflects a commitment to end child labour in all its forms. It is time to step up action, the ILO says. 
A new ILO report, Towards the Urgent Elimination of Hazardous Child Labour, finds that certain occupational hazards -- including exposure to psychological stress and to commonly-used chemicals -- are even more serious for children than previously thought. 
Another key finding is that adolescence, as a period of physical maturation, may start earlier and last into the mid-twenties. Within this extended period of growth, children (and young adults), face a range of vulnerabilities that require responses in law and practice. 
In Sri Lanka, child labour may not be as extensive as in many other countries. But sometimes poverty-stricken families who have no means of feeding or giving education or healthcare to their children are forced to send them for household work in the families of rich and ruling elite. Such families need to ensure that the children while helping in the household work are provided education and healthcare facilities. They need to remember that just using or abusing a child is a crime that will bring penalties of hell-fire.

Eat, Play, Love: Sri Lankas children need more to ensure they enter adulthood without a disadvant
	
Jananath Warakagoda and his son Januth
Children in Sri Lanka are at risk of entering adulthood at a disadvantage to their peers, because they have not benefited from the good nutrition, stimulation and protection - known as eat, play and love - that enable a brain to grow to its full capacity by the age of 5 years, warns UNICEF.
Advances in neuroscience have proved that during the early years of life a childs brain grows at an astounding rate which is never again repeated. During this time, neural connections occur at lightning speed, forming the architecture of a childs brains and determining their health, ability to learn and deal with stress, and even influencing their earning capacity as adults. Incredibly, a childs brain grows and develops to 85 per cent of its full capacity by the age of 5.
In these early years brain development depends on three things: good nutrition, play and stimulation in the home environment and in preschools (aged 3-5 years), and love and protection from harm including violence, abuse and neglect.
These can be provided by parents through simple actions, and can make a lasting, positive difference to a childs development. Yet at present too many children in Sri Lanka are at risk of missing out on some or all of these key interventions:
 An estimate 17% of children under five are at risk of poor development due to stunted growth*, resulting from poor nutrition.
 15.1% of children under five are suffering from 'wasting'*, which if untreated can lead to chronic malnutrition.
 73.4% of children aged one to fourteen experience corporal punishment at home by parents**, including children under the age of five.
 Only 48.7% of three to five-year olds attend pre-school***, which when of good quality helps to foster cognitive and language development, social competency and emotional development.
Marking the run up to Fathers Day (17th June) - an internationally recognized moment to celebrate good parenting - UNICEF has launched a new digital campaign to celebrate and inform parents how they can support their childrens optimal brain development. Directed by Ilango Ram and featuring musician Jananath Warakagoda, former Sri Lankan national rugby captain Fazil Marija, and broadcaster K C Pragash, each with their own children, the campaign consists of three two-minute masterclasses that, in a humorous way give key information to parents on how through simple actions, they can help to build their childrens brains.
Fazil Marija and his daughter Liyara
Each masterclass is based on a key insight, including the fact that up to 75% of the energy derived from food goes toward brain development in under-fives, and that five minutes of play can spark 300,000 brain connections in young children.
The science is clear - the first five years of life are absolutely critical to a childs whole future said Tim Sutton, Representative, UNICEF Sri Lanka, adding This means that if we dont enable every child to reach their full brain capacity by age five, we are robbing them, and Sri Lanka of its most valuable resource  the brains of its next generation. At present, too many children are at risk of entering adulthood at a disadvantage. Thankfully, parents can make all the difference. Through eat, play and love they have the power transform their childs future.
Stimulation, in the form of quality preschool learning opportunities between the ages of three and five is also vital to development. A quality preschool is a place where trained teachers help children learn through play, fostering cognitive and language development and social and emotional competencies, yet many, often the poorest, **** do not attend.
To ensure that every child under 5, irrespective of their wealth or location can benefit from at least one year of quality pre-school, giving them the best possible chance to succeed in school and life, UNICEF has launched an online petition at www.unicef.lk/eatplaylove, open to all that will be presented to decision makers in the future. We urge all to sign.

Galavumkaruwano The Redeemer
	
Kamal Dias, a parishioner of St. Michaels Church, Koralawella, received an invitation from the then Parish Priest, Rev. Fr. Leo Camillus to direct a Passion Play for the parishioners. Accordingly, he directed his first drama titled Last Supper in 2012, which was staged at parish premises. In the following year 2013, at the request of Rev. Fr. Eric Madurawela he directed The Redeemer.
Whole of 2014, Kamal devotes his time to study and do a research on passion plays.Passion Plays of Rev. Fr. Jacome Gonsalvez, Duwa, Boralessa and Oberamagu in Germany gives him the required insights. Further he was fortunate enough to receive some books written by Prof. Vijitha Rohana of Kelaniya University on this subject. Subsequently the dramatist becomes very enthusiastic in giving the hidden reality of the passion of Jesus Christ; His sacrificial role of bringing salvation to a fallen humanity. 
By 2015 Kamal succeeds in directing a comprehensive passion play. Promptly he receives he receives full patronage of Rev. Fr. Shihan Indika Perera, present Parish Priest. Another committed parishioner, Roshan Fernando very generously undertakes the production and management. From then onwards Kamal, with the blessings of the Almighty God directs 4 dramas (2015  2018). Script writing, music, recording, sound management and direction are solely by this dramatist. Gradually the hidden talents of this artiste begin to unfold.
Passion play titled, Galawumkaruwanoin 2015 highlights the conversion of St. Paul. Sacred touch of the Lord converts the Roman officer, Saul who persecuted the Jewish Christians to Paul the Missionary. The main theme of this drama confirms the fact that Lord is able to transform anyone according to His Holy Will for His service. Protagonists high standard of acting portrays the message to the society in a powerful way. Galavumkaruwano in 2016 brings to the forefront the character of Barabbas and his change. Character of the thief on the right hand side is also special. The remarkable feature of this drama is how great a sinner is if he repents and turns to the Lord, he will be pardoned by unconditional love and forgiveness of Jesus. This is a call to the audience to repent and practice the noble quality of forgiveness, as done by the Master Himself. 
In 2017, drama takes a different turn as a beautiful presentation. Six young maidens depict the wind (Sulanga). Main theme is, Do not let the Word of God be swept away by the wind. It also shows the obstacles people have to face to encounter Jesus. E.gs. Leader of the Jewish Council, preventing Jairus from meeting Jesus, temptations of Jesus, where satan takes great effort to prevent Jesus from carrying out Fathers Will and His mission. It is difficult to obey the commands of the Lord, but if you do, reward is yours (Peter casting the net and getting a big catch of fish). This drama gives the message to the modern society, which runs a rat race to attain wealth, power and positions. It clearly shows the futility of these efforts. Obeying Gods word and living a life adopting Kingdom values is the key for peace and happiness. This is a comprehensive beautiful drama with rich lyrics and dances.
In 2018, Galavumkaruwano the dramatist introduces two fictitious characters, Gamael and Eliyas. Ancient Jewish society, with a superiority complex treats Samaritans in a degrading manner. They were humiliated and rejected. As a defensive combat Gamael, the Samaritan forms a group to fight against Jews. But the Lord Almighty completely changes this plan. While training this group Gamael, gets struck with leprosy. According to the Jewish custom he goes to the leprosy colony (ostracized). There he meets Elias,the friendly Jew. While associating with him, his hatred towards Jews diminishes. He sees people of various situations, rich and poor, educated and illiterate, just and unjust, Jews and Samaritans, all living in harmony sharing what they get. They expect only Divine Healing for their sins. He also learns about Jesus the Jewish Healer, develops a thirst to meet Jesus. After meeting Jesus and receiving healing he gets a desire to share the peace, joy, healing and his marvelous transformation with others and becomes a missionary. 
Life style of ancient Jewish leaders has a parallel to our modern society and political leaders. At that time hypocritical Jewish religious leaders, burdened the citizens with taxes and hard rules. All these were for their benefit and gain. If we turn the search light to present day happenings, it is very much similar. Dramatist in a subtle way opens the eyes of the audience to the fact that, exploitation of helpless is a great sin. 
According to Kamal all the actors and actresses from 2012 to 2018 are from Koralawella itself. For each drama about 50 of them participate. Also he gets the support of another 80 parishioners during practices and staging the plays. Training period is 2  months. Attendance has been 95% late in the evenings (after work and after school). For all this, he is very grateful to all who co-operated with him. It is with great delight he stated that during drama practices people of different ages and levels of society were bonded in a spirit of brotherhood and commitment, which brought himself satisfaction. He believes that the touch of the Lord Almighty and the guidance of the Holy Spirit which were there throughout made these things a possibility. Therefore his praises and thanks to the Holy Trinity and St. Michael will be there forever. Thus ended our conversation.

Georgias PM resigns after protests and party Infighting
	
The prime minister of Georgia resigned on Wednesday, citing disagreements with Bidzina Ivanishvili, the founder of the governing party and the countrys richest man.
The resignation of Prime Minister Giorgi Kvirikashvili was announced in the wake of a series of antigovernment protests that have disrupted Tbilisi, the capital.
We have had a number of fundamental disagreements with the partys leader over the past months, Mr. Kvirikashvili, who has headed the government since 2015, said in a televised briefing, without going into details. Today is the moment when the partys chairman should have the opportunity to form a team on the basis of his own views.
In May, Mr. Ivanishvili announced his return to politics in Georgia, a former Soviet republic in the southern Caucasus Mountains between Russia and Turkey. Mr. Ivanishvili, a businessman, was elected chairman of the governing Georgian Dream party, which he had founded.
After the collapse of the Soviet Union, Mr. Ivanishvili made billions in the Russian banking and metal industries. In 2012, he founded his own party in Georgia, which defeated Mikheil Saakashvilis United National Movement in a parliamentary election the same year. Mr. Ivanishvili became prime minister, only to step aside in favor of a longtime business associate, Irakli Garibashvili, in 2013.
With his fortune estimated at about a third of Georgias gross domestic product, Mr. Ivanishvili was believed to control the countrys politics from his futuristic palace, which sits atop of one of the hills overlooking Tbilisi.
In a speech at his partys convention, which elected him chairman in May, Mr. Ivanishvili cited economic underdevelopment, disagreements within his party and the hostility of his opponents as reasons for his re-entry into politics.
Olesya Vartanyan, a Tbilisi-based analyst with the International Crisis Group, said both Mr. Ivanishvilis return to politics and the protests were related to diminished public trust in Georgias government.
The Georgian government has been in crisis for quite a long time, Ms. Vartanyan said. Mr. Ivanishvilis comeback and popular protests are just symptoms of this process.
One wave of protests was provoked by the murder of two teenagers, who were killed in a knife fight in central Tbilisi last December. Zaza Saralidze, the father of one of the two 16-year-old boys, accused the countrys prosecutors of a cover-up to protect the assailants.
Since the end of May, Mr. Saralidze has been leading demonstrations, setting up tents in front of Parliament and periodically blocking Tbilisis main thoroughfare. The countrys prosecutor general was forced to resign, but the protesters demanded the resignation of the prime minister as well.
Earlier in May, Tbilisi was the scene of a different kind of protest. Thousands of young people gathered in front of Parliament to protest against a heavy-handed antidrug police raid on two nightclubs in the capital.
That time, however, instead of just shouting political slogans, the protesters also danced to techno music, turning a rally into a party. (NY Times)

Give  children their Childhood!
	

AYEVAC Youth Collective underscores why it is important to be more humane when dealing with children

Children are the fruits of society. While one group of privileged children are pampered with luxuries, another group is left unattended. This group, vulnerable to all sorts of physical and psychological abuse, end up in the gutters of society.
Being looked down as the unprivileged, unfortunate lot, they end up becoming child labour and child employees, fulfilling the needs of others, sacrificing all pleasant experiences a child could have during his or her childhood. In an attempt to eradicate violence on children, the Alliance of Youth to End Violence Against Children known as AYEVAC - a collective of seven volunteer youth organisations has commenced its campaign to protect childrens rights. 

The journey of AYEVAC
AYEVAC consists of several organisations which have been involved in social work. Since it is a start-up organisation, this collective is backed by Child Fund Sri Lanka which provides them with the technical and financial support. Through that, they receive leadership training programmes and other activities to fine-tune their knowledge on photography, drawing posters, cinematography and various other avenues which are essential to promote the campaign. Recently, the AYEVAC Youth Collective, backed by the Abhimana organization at national level succeeded in presenting a petition with 100,000 signatures to Chandrani Bandara, Minister of Women and Child Affairs. The petition also consisted of a proposal to fight against child abuse in Sri Lanka. During an event held to present this document, the efforts taken by the organisation to draw attention to the steps they had outlined was highlighted. The members of AYEVAC had carried out an island-wide door-to-door campaign, raising awareness and amassing public support for the cause. The organisation launched this campaign under the theme Be humane towards children and requested the responsible adults of society to represent and emanate the values of humanity and to rid themselves of inhumane qualities. 


Issues identified
It is not easy to protect children at this day and age of technological advancements. Technology keeps children and the youth addicted to devices and this is one place where they become victims. During their campaign, the AYEVAC Youth Collective has identified several issues relating to child abuse. These include : 

Children experiencing physical and mental trauma. 
	Injustice faced by guardians of children as a result of several loopholes which exist within the judicial process. 
	Lack of adequate regulations to avoid children from being harassed and bullied on social media. 
	Lack of a childs fundamental right to education. 
	Child labour. 

Suggestions
According to the studies conducted by the AYEVAC Youth Collective several suggestions have proposed in order to minimize incidents of violence and abuse towards children. Some of them include : 
Drafting the necessary policies to eliminate physical and mental abuse experienced by children. 
	
	Strengthening the judicial system and establishing childrens courts in every district. 
	
	Introduce new methods of providing evidence such as through videos when the child is being summoned in courts. 
	
	Officials working with children should be given technical training in terms of using social media and modern ways of communication. 
	
	Spreading awareness among parents and teachers in order to join hands with youth groups and children and also increase the number of officials working with children. 
	
	Establishing social and psychological well-being among children who have gone through an abusive experience. 
	
	Including children into the legal process. 
	
	Children staying at home or used for labour should be identified and sent to school. 
	
	The minimum age for a child to be gain employment should be made 16 years. 

Children should be given an opportunity to enjoy childhood
In her comments subject Minister Chandrani Bandara said that children are the assets of this world. The various injustices faced by children were highlighted during this programme. In order to avoid such incidents from recurring, the Abhimana Organization has commenced operations across nine provinces. As the subject minister I have always stood for the children and have fought for their rights. Therefore it is important to join hands with one another and work towards this goal rather than work as individuals. Im proud of this organization and the young minds behind it. The private and the public sector should be involved in these projects in order to strengthen their effectiveness. The Petition handed over to me today has identified several key areas which need to be considered and if we try to find solutions to these issues, we will be able to protect the countrys future generations. One of these solutions includes the establishment of childrens courts and we have already discussed with the relevant minister regarding this matter. This is mainly because we see that childrens cases are piling up, but no actionhas been taken.

It is not easy to protect children at this day and age of technological advancements Technology keeps children and the youth addicted to devices and this is one place where they become victims.

Sometimes these children have become adults and have gotten married by the time their cases are taken up for hearing in courts. We have taken numerous measures to eradicate child labour but it still in a very organized manner. Children should be given a chance to enjoy their childhood at school and with friends and by not working for someone to earn money. Therefore parents have a bigger responsibility in terms of showing them the correct path to tread. Money is not everything and parents have to provide a secure environment in which they could grow up. If they are given the necessary love and care they will be able to excel in their lives. We have seen a drastic progress in terms of development, but with the introduction of social media, children and teenagers are once again a vulnerable group. Therefore those who misuse social media to bully and intimidate the youth need to be identified and produced incourts, she said.
Speaking further she said that there are children who cannot afford to go to school and are being used to work in garages and other non-child friendly environments. We are in the process of conducting programmes to identify these children, discuss with their parents and send them back to school. A childs education is a fundamental right and we as parents should help them to fulfill their dreams. In addition to that, the officials involved in these programmes will be trained to enhance their knowledge through novel and innovative approaches. As such these programmes will contribute in securing achilds future.

The Colombo Branch of the Kandy Good Shepherd Convent Past Pupils Association was launched in 1978 by a few members and founded by the late Enid Perera (wife of the then IGP Earnest Perera). 
The Association grew slowly, and in 1987 with the joining of Shamina Hameed (wife of the then Foreign Minister A.C.S. Hameed), it grew into full bloom and launched the very first fund- raising project Sparkle 87. 
Ever since then our projects have helped the school in various ways and our ongoing pet project - maintaining Ward 24 of the Mulleriyawa Mental Hospital - is a social work activity.

Latest addition to the Fairway Colombo events - Street Latin Night!
	
Fairway Colombo brought about yet another impressive addition to their series of street events with the introduction of Street Latin Night, the first of which took place on Tuesday 12th June at Hospital Street, Colombo 01.
Leading the inaugural event was Sri Lankas own Kasun Dias  founder and principal teacher of Star Latinos Dance Academy. The dancers took to the streets with renditions of Salsa, Bachata and Kizomba, grooving and moving to the Latin music beats.
The special guest for the night, Nelson Campos is the first internationally acclaimed Kizomba teacher/dance artist to visit Sri Lanka. Known as the Kizomba guru, Nelson is the teacher of teachers, the driving force behind many successful Kizomba teachers and dancers in Asia and around the world. He is visiting Sri Lanka to conduct a series of workshops and tantalized the guests with his tasteful and breathtaking foot-work on the very first evening of his stay.
A throng of onlookers gathered around to watch the dancers as well as join in the fun themselves. Regardless of being beginners or professional Latin dancers, guests simply got on their feet to have a fun filled evening, as Kasun led them through a few basic steps and got everyone dancing.
Street Latin Night is Fairway Colombos latest addition to the Hospital Street events calendar, which comprises of the Colombo Street Food Festival, Art & Jazz on the Street, Jam on the Street, Fairway Cultural Show, and Vinyl Night. It will be a regular event taking place on the first Tuesday of every month in collaboration with the National Dancesport Federation of Sri Lanka.
The concept of the street events came from the need to create a great location where people from various walkes of life could come together to celebrate different forms of art and culture. It deviates from the high-end, closed doors cultural events and makes it accessible to everyone by bringing it out in to the streets. The Fairway Colombo Hospital Street events have become equally popular among the locals and foreigners alike. Another unique feature is that all of these events require no entrance fee or cover charge.
Fairway Colombo is a subsidiary of Fairway Holdings, which supports local arts and culture through numerous initiatives.

Let us keep an eye on Uncle Sam
	
Anyone who has read Noam Chomskys What Uncle Sam really wants would not get too excited when a US President, Secretary of State or Ambassador talks about democracy. Neither would they lose any sleep over such worthies speaking in somber tones about individuals, parties or governments they dislike. 
Chomskys book, published in 1993, traces four decades of US intervention in all parts of the world. It is all about the use of subversion and force for economic and political hegemony. To achieve various ends the USA often supported violent regimes and dictatorships, Chomsky shows. For all the bleeding-heart talk about democracy, good governance and peace, the USA has had no qualms over propping up or placing in power, tyrants, autocrats, military juntas and brutal monarchies. 
Right here in Sri Lanka, weve heard one US Ambassador after another reading that tired script, except that theyve been condescending, unapologetic and downright uncouth at times. Essentially they played Viceroy rather than Ambassador. 
At times it is about the USAs economic interests. Teresita Currie Schaffer said at a seminar held at the Agrarian Research and Training Institute in 1993, your food security lies in the wheat fields of North America. That was a time when USAID was pushing the then government to cripple rice cultivation. In more recent years Robert O Blake (2006-2009) did his utmost to sabotage the military offensive against the LTTE, clearly intent on finding ways to ensure that this terrorist organization lives to fight another day. 
His successor Patricia Butenis had a sordid track record in Iraq, Colombia, El Salvador and Bangladesh. At a farewell speech at the Gulshan Club, Dhaka, she had said that though some Bangladeshis believed she was sometimes too outspoken, this was because Ambassadors must be clear about their countrys interests and viewpoints to avoid misunderstanding. I was told that Dr. Abdullah Dewan, Professor of Economics at Eastern Michigan University and a Bangladeshi American had observed: There was no misunderstanding on our part; she was not just outspoken, but openly meddled, apparently beyond her mandated duty, in the internal affairs of a sovereign country and made it look like a client state of America. 
Even if Keshap has not said anything of the sort, it is high time that the people of this country pay careful heed to everything that the US Embassy in Colombo says and does, for none of it is about friendship but all of it is about serving US interests which, as history has demonstrated amply, do not coincide with the interests of the particular countries and citizens
That says it all. And thats why no one should be surprised at outgoing US Ambassador Atul Keshaps tendentious comments on the Sri Lankan political situation and potential presidential candidate Gotabaya Rajapaksa. The comments that appeared at length In a Jaffna-based Tamil daily were translated and posted by well-known political commentator D.B.S. Jeyaraj on his blog. 
Apparently Keshap had told former president Mahinda Rajapaksa that, the US and Other western nations do not welcome the prospects of his brother Gotabaya becoming president and are opposed to such a move. 
Thats speaking his mind, fair enough. He has also threatened, the report says, that the US would not permit Gotabaya Rajapaksa to renounce US citizenship at this juncture, which would make it illegal for him to contest under the restrictions enshrined in the 19th Amendment. Apparently, Gotabaya needs to clear himself of allegations against him over war crimes, crimes against humanity and human rights violations before the US would allow him to renounce US citizenship formally. 
Thats rich. Here we have a representative of a country which was built on and sustained by war crimes, crimes against humanity and human rights violations wearing a halo and waving a saints wand. 
Now its true that we have only the word of the person Jeyaraj has quoted, Nadesapillai Vithyatharan, editor of the Jaffna-based Kaalaikkathir (Morning Sun). Keshap has not, as of yet, denied the story. 
Two things need to be said however, given what the USA was and is. Firstly, if the USA supports any individual, party or government in any country, it should be treated as a red light. Secondly, if the USA vilifies anyone, any party or government, theres a strong likelihood that such entities are likely to have some credence in the eyes of the particular polity, at least to the level that they deserve consideration. 
Gotabaya has not been charged by any US court of law as of now. Not that we trust the US justice system any more than we do ours of course. The issue of citizenship can come into the frame if and only if he is taken to court. If the intention is less about concern over rights violations (and we know the USA is big on talk and lethargic or at best selective on action) than about outcome preferences that are in the interest of the USA, then we need to be concerned. 
Whether Gotabaya is in fact interested in becoming President, we dont know. If he is, and if the USA intervenes along the lines that Vithyatharan reports Keshap has outlined, thats Gotabayas problem first and foremost. The citizens of this country need to have a different take on all this. 
First, knowing the pernicious ways of the USA, we would need to revisit the relevant caveats in the 19th Amendment and amend them forthwith purely on the basis of retaining sovereignty and not allowing foreign governments to dictate this countrys political process. 
Secondly, we need to revisit the entire narrative about the money that the USA has spent on certain candidates and political coalitions. Thirdly we need to treat with utmost suspicion and contempt all those who benefited from the largesse of the US State Department. Today, it is clearer than it was three years ago, that this regime gives not a hoot about things such as democracy, good governance, transparency and accountability (never mind that it is made up of the most incompetent and confused bunch of leaders to rule this country since Independence). That money, even if it was invested for democracy, has delivered crumbs in return. Even if it had yielded much more, its still interference that is clearly an infringement of established diplomatic protocol. 
Finally, even if Keshap has not said anything of the sort, it is high time that the people of this country pay careful heed to everything that the US Embassy in Colombo says and does, for none of it is about friendship but all of it is about serving US interests which, as history has demonstrated amply, do not coincide with the interests of the particular countries and citizens. 
Keshap has had an easy time than did his predecessors because this is a US-friendly regime. The truth is it is a regime that happily genuflects before Uncle Sam. Even if Vithyatharan was mistaken we need not be mistaken about the thinking of the USA. Given the doldrums that this regime is languishing in right now, there is a palpable possibility of regime-change and in a direction that might not be to the liking of the USA. Keshaps successors may have to take on a tougher assignment. 
Perhaps Keshap will give an official farewell speech somewhere. Perhaps he will tell us the truth about this conversation hes said to have had with Mahinda Rajapaksa. I hope he does. I will be listening and I hope all citizens of this country listen too. Such statements tell us a lot.

Machang, no time to respond to every inaccurate news: Keshap
	
Outgoing US Ambassador Atul Keshap, in response to a blogger on the Daily Mirror article on the Ambassadors meeting with former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, said if they responded to every inaccurate news story that appears, they would have little time for anything else.
Tweeting the Daily Mirror article which said US was not in favour of Gotabaya Rajapaksa becoming President, the blogger asked the Ambassador "Machang, Atul, you guys couldn't stop a reality TV show host from becoming your president. Maybe get your own house in order before you dictate terms to everyone else, noh
Ambassador Keshap replied Machang, if we responded to every inaccurate news story that appears, we would have little time for anything else,.
An article about the Keshap-Rajapaksa meeting had initially appeared on Tamil daily Kaalaikkathir which said Ambassador Keshap had reportedly said the US and the Western did not welcome the prospects of Gotabaya Rajapaksa contesting and becoming the President of Sri Lanka.
However, when the Daily Mirror inquired about the meeting from the Embassy earlier, the Embassy remained non-committal.
The Ambassador meets routinely with political leaders, civil society and community leaders. The Ambassador honours the confidence of private meetings and does not discuss the contents of such meetings publicly, it said.
Earlier, the media unit of former President Rajapaksa said false reports were circulating over the meeting held with Ambassador Keshap.
The contents of the cordial discussion held between Mr. Rajapaksa and the Ambassador had been altered in the media reports. We have not issued any official statement over the meeting and we are not responsible for any of these false reports, the media unit said.

## Title: No jail term for 13 Swiss LTTE financiers

No jail term for 13 Swiss LTTE financiers
	
The Swiss Federal Criminal Court has given no prison terms to alleged financiers of the LTTE, the Swissinfo news reported on Thursday. It said the 13 accused were either given suspended custodial sentences or acquitted.
The court on Thursday said accusations of participation in and support of a criminal organisation did not stand and therefore, released all of the accused.
It noted that the hierarchical link between the LTTE and the World Tamil Coordinating Committee (WTCC)was not sufficiently established. The judges also felt there was not enough concrete proof to consider the LTTE as a criminal organisation.
While the federal prosecutor Juliette Noto had asked for prison terms of between 18 months and six years for the accused, the court did not oblige.
Eight of the thirteen on the docks were acquitted of all charges. The others were only found guilty of fraud. WTCCs finance manager and one of the accused who arranged loans from Bank Now (owned by Credit Suisse) on false pretences got a 24-month suspended sentence. The president of WTCC got 21 months while the finance managers deputy got 20 months in suspended sentences.
The whole process is estimated to have cost close to 4 million Swiss francs (CHF) which the federal government will have to bear. In addition to this amount, compensation for those acquitted, as well as lawyers fees total to almost CHF5 million. The accused will have to pay part of their lawyers expenses provided they have the financial means to do so.
During the eight-week trial, which opened in January and closed in March, the federal prosecutor requested sentences of up to six-and-a-half years in prison. The proceedings cost CHF3.8 million.
The 13 defendants - 12 Tamils or Swiss citizens of Tamil origin plus one German - were accused of participating in or supporting a criminal organisation, fraud, forgery, money laundering and extortion.
During her indictment, Juliette Noto, a federal prosecutor, described a sophisticated system used by the WTCC to raise funds largely for armed struggle from the Tamil community in Switzerland. The Tamil community in Switzerland was systematically registered and its ability to pay assessed. Families who refused to pay were threatened, she said.
Noto cast the LTTE, who are represented in Switzerland by the WTCC, as a violent movement "whose effectiveness inspired Al-Qaeda".
Showing a picture of the WTCC leader behind a machine gun and images of child soldiers, she enumerated the attacks and crimes attributed to the Tamil Tigers. The prosecutor sought to demonstrate the informed involvement of the accused in supporting and funding the LTTE.
In their pleadings, the defence invoked the legitimacy of the Tigers' struggle against the Sri Lankan government's repression of the Tamil minority. They argued that the money collected in Switzerland by the accused for the WTCC was mainly used for humanitarian purposes. The defence also challenged the prosecution of the accused at a time when Tiger resistance was collapsing in Sri Lanka.
During the hearings, the accused spoke at length about the repression suffered in Sri Lanka and the atrocities committed by the security forces. They kept silent when asked about their specific involvement.

On Professor Carlo Fonseka for no reason at all
	

With apologies for generalising, I would say that despite decades of free education Sri Lankans are still lazy thinkers; a most gullible lot. Astrologers abound and it is easy to spread a false story. Divine intervention is still widely believed and sought after and clever Kattadiyas make good money. Political leaders shamelessly dash coconuts asking for divine curses on enemies. Faith healing missionaries keep audiences spellbound. Schools do teach science but students are not encouraged to think scientifically. Subject content is studied for exams and the scientific thinking habit ends after uploading the textual content at exams. Science is divorced from lives. (Shyamon Jayasinghe)

I still remember the first time I met him. It was somewhere in 2013. To keep a long story short, I had written a book and owing to my immaturity (I was 18 at the time, after all) I felt he was the best person to write the foreword to it. And why Because the book, a novella (which I have since disowned, so horrendous it is!), delved into the perennial conflict between reason and mysticism and Prof. Carlo Fonseka, a leading light in the Rationalist Movement in Sri Lanka, would have enjoyed reading on that. Or so I thought. What I knew, back then, during that first visit, was that he wanted to meet me. (I had provided him with a first draft beforehand). So I went, rather pompously (I was 18 and immature, let us remember once more), to his residence, a large, sprawling, and yet somewhat un-ostentatious home tucked away in the corner of Pita Kotte, and rang the bell. He was not there, he was in the washroom, and he would meet me in five minutes, I was told. So I sat down and waited, eager and (again, I was immature) rather pompous.

I was not fully aware of the professors contribution to the field, barring a quick perusal of the translation of Abraham Kovoors Gods, Demons, and Spirits (the translation, Deviyo saha Bhoothayo, was by Dharmapala Senaratne

I came to talk about the book, its contents, and what the professor could write by way of penning the foreword. Instead, after he came, the first thing (or one of the first things) he asked me was what I thought about Shakespeare. I was no Shakespeare fan by any stretch of the imagination  besides, I have a poor memory, so remembering those immortal lines of his has always been a tedious, impossible task  but I had seen some film adaptations of the Bards work, and I told him that the play which caught my attention the most was Julius Caesar, hastening to add that I was an ardent fan of the 1953 adaptation starring (of all people!) Marlon Brando. Prof. Fonseka, whom I thought preferred the book to the film (which he did, as he implied later), was astounded, and went on relating his first experience seeing it at the Regal when he was a schoolboy at St. Josephs College, and how he would sacrifice the opportunity of seeing the Big Match to frequent the Regal and watch other movie adaptations of the Bards plays. Shakespeare forged the first demagogue in the history of English literature, in Mark Antony, he told me. The conversation trailed from one play to another, until it struck noon. And no, we didnt talk about the book.
Before I left, he brought a copy of The Island (it was a Sunday) and showed me an article he had written on the indomitable Richard Dawkins, and on rationalism. Back then I was not fully aware of the professors contribution to the field, barring a quick perusal of the translation of Abraham Kovoors Gods, Demons, and Spirits (the translation, Deviyo saha Bhoothayo, was by Dharmapala Senaratne, another firebrand from the Rationalist Movement). I didnt think much about it but after I went home, and in the following days when I checked the archives of the Island and came across his encounters with the inimitable Nalin de Silva, I was fascinated. I could not decide on which side to take, or whether I was meant to take sides. Had I consulted Fonseka, I am sure he would have given the same answer. Like Nalin, he had been an eloquent speaker and moreover a member of the Sinhala Debating Society at his school (Nalin had been the Captain at Royal College). Despite this, they resorted to manifestly different styles and manifestly different tricks. I remember in particular an exchange towards the end of Doramadalawa where the professor, who never loses his cool, replied to his opponent with this aside:

When I checked the archives of the Island and came across his encounters with the inimitable Nalin de Silva, I was fascinated. I couldnt decide which side to take, or whether I was meant to take sides

Naturally enough, this enraged the opponent: He went on and on as the credits rolled. I couldnt resist smiling. So I smiled. Not with all those intellectual salvos, not with all his credentials (and I have found much in those credentials to side with, to agree with) could he withstand that fatal, awe-inducing final remark. That was Carlo Fonseka, cool, witty and resolute.
Over the months and years there have been so many other things about the man that I come across and have agreed and disagreed with, spanning the scientific, the cultural, the political, and the personal. His prose, at once self-explanatory and gradual, never seems to creep away and leave you in the dark. Perhaps its a legacy of his work as a medicine man, but when he writes, he writes so much at length that it seems hes trying to get his point across as comprehensively as he can. Its almost as though hes afraid of leaving something behind, as though the careful reader (as opposed to the common reader) will chide him in his mind should he commit that unforgivable error. And heaven forbid any essay of his which does not include his thoughts on the link between evolutionary science and cultural, social, and political processes! Just take a gander at his pieces on Malini Fonseka, Rukmani Devi, Victor Ratnayake, and the late Amaradeva and Lester James Peries. Hes always bringing up biology, and while critics have taken him to task (some have even penned irate replies to what he has written) over this, I believe he is spot on.
Two years ago, he published a compendium of his writings, fittingly titling it Essays of a Lifetime. I have not read it. I could not. By the time I got around to buying it, it had been sold out. But I have read reviews of the collection by, among others, Laksiri Fernando (I was delighted to know Prof. Carlo Fonsekas popular writings are now published in one volume), Kumar David (Carlo is an N. M. man; I am a Samasamajist), and Shyamon Jayasinghe, whose article I have alluded to at the beginning of this tribute. Shyamon takes to task the contention that erudite as he was, a Fonseka would never have been born after the advent of Free Education and Sinhala Only, and though I only partly agree with this thesis (which has been demolished by many leading intellectuals and critics, top among them Regi Siriwardena, over the decades), I nevertheless am in accord with his stance that there is much in our education system which leaves no room for free thinkers, let alone rationalists and scientists and radicals. Where I also agree with it is the fact that since he took the Rationalist Movement to what it became in the seventies and eighties, people are as gullible as ever. Is this an indictment on the professors own work, which has been criticized by the likes of Nalin de Silva as being blatantly Judeo-Christian as the Christianity and theism it seeks to encounter and flay I am not in a position to say.

Over the months and years there have been so many other things about the man that I come across and have agreed and disagreed with, spanning the scientific, the cultural, the political, and the personal

Ever since that day in 2013, I must have met him about five times, including once in 2016 and again in 2018, the latter about three weeks ago at the Memorial Service for Lester James Peries (where he delivered the eulogy). He has mellowed gracefully. His wit, his way of talking slowly, to the point, and never off the cuff, is still there. They say Lester reminded one of a Bourbon Prince: short, unassuming, and never beset by the arrogance which visits lesser personalities. Well, if that were the case, you can say the same thing of the good professor: short, full of humility, and never even once arrogant. I keep my pride locked up. It escapes only through my work, Lester told me. Again, you can make the same case for Fonseka - his word is his work, and his work is his pride. But that was a different time. A time so different that we cant escape into it. The past, as someone once wisely said, is another world altogether. One would have to be extremely fortunate to have born to it. Lester was. Carlo was. Many others were. We were not.

The Presidential Commission appointed to probe Sri Lankan Airlines, Sri Lankan Catering and Mihin Lanka yesterday directed investigators to inquire as to whether there was an influence from Mihin Lanka or any other body over the BoI to continue with tax concessions for Mihin Lanka, even though it was apparent that Mihin Lanka had violated the BoI Agreement in that regard.

Probe coal scams from 2009 to 2016: Champika
	
Megapolis and Western Development Minister Champika Ranawaka yesterday urged President Maithripala Sirisena to appoint a Presidential Commission with extraordinary powers to investigate the alleged coal scams that took place from 2009 to 2016.
He said the scam which was bigger than the Central Banks Treasury bond scam benefited by many while two million of countrys population still suffering due to high electricity tariffs.
Minister Ranawaka said that he has the relevant documents and facts over the scams and will not hesitate to testify and reveal before a Presidential Commission.
Minister Ranawaka requested to probe why it had been allowed the coal tender to the same company during the period from 2009 to 2016.
In line with the Auditor Generals Report on coal tenders during the stipulated period which had been handed over to Parliamentary Oversight Committee on Energy, the minister urged that the committee should expose those who granted the tenders within the period to the same company and those who benefited by the scam.
Commission should immediately reveal the officials and politicos connected with the scam. It should investigate the role played by the official and non-official agents of the company before the election and after the election period, he said.
He explained said that several media institutions that obtained coal money launched media fascism to sling mud on several politicians including him, therefore, asked to look into those media institutions.
Minister Ranawaka also requested to find who is behind launching the countrys first communication satellite, Supreme SAT and its links with the Torian Co., the coal supplier.
He urged to find out whether a group of LTTEers was sponsored by this fund in 2014 when a coal contract was given to a South African country and asked whether it was any pre-planned programme to boycott the elections in North through LTTE during the 2015 Presidential Election.

Every year a seminar is held by the committee on this day to educate and create awareness among the people on how the use of tobacco leads to cancer. This year we targeted vulnerable schoolchildren as the incidence of smoking has increased among schoolchildren. It was stressed at the seminar that 87% of lung cancer was due to cigarette smoking and that smoking affects not only the lungs but other areas of the body too, such as mouth, ears, eyes, tongue and oesophagus. 
The first speaker Mr Christie Fernando of the Asiri Surgical Laboratory elaborated his address with a power point presentation. Next an eminent doctor from the National Cancer Control Programme (NCCP), Dr. Manoj Karunaratne addressed the gathering. With his wit and motivating ability he kept the children engrossed. The children enthusiastically answered the questions put to them. The response was excellent. There were 117 students and 28 teachers, A file with brochures, pamplets, a book mark with warnings on smoking and a booklet on the hazards of smoking, was given to every participant.

## Title: Sexual bribery in Sri Lanka : Victims continue to Cry in silence

Sexual bribery in Sri Lanka : Victims continue to Cry in silence
	
A recent report carried out by a non-governmental organization stated that 90% of women in Sri Lanka are sexually harassed in public buses and trains.Rape and sexual abuse cases are reported by the mediaand heard by courts in bignumbers every day.A widespread practice,which is relativelyunspoken of,but adds to thelist of howwomen arevictimisedbecause of theirsex is sexualbribery 
Bribery isnt a strange or unconventional activity when considering the institutional structure of Sri Lanka. Hardly anything happens in this country without bribes. 
Although putting a stop to bribery and corruption and institutionalising the practice of prosecuting fraudsters related to monetary bribes more efficaciously have been in the forefront of the Governments policy manifestos, barely anything has been done to identify and punish perpetrators of sexual bribery. Victims keep their traumatic experiences to themselves to avoid social blame, so most often the offenders continue with this practice with the women who come to their assistance. With regard to cases where women have been bold to report matters to the police or other authorities, the biggest punishment given to such corrupt officers hasnt been anything more than a transfer. 
Imagine if one were a single mother, raising a son, and working as an activist in ones community, apart from living alone. She often interacts with the police with regard to community work.
One day when she visits the police station, a senior police officer shakes her hand longer, pinches it, smiles at her in a suggestive way and winks at her. It can be assumed that the majority of the public wont consider this as serious, but just put yourself in the same situation and think whether you should be treated that way Would you think on the same lines as follows if you were a victim 
We take many victims to court, but when it happened to me I did not challenge it in court. I know I could have made a complaint at the Human Rights Commission without going to the police, but I did not do it. I feared that everyone would come to know and start sensationalistic gossip. I have a grown-up boy and if he hears about it, it will be bad because there have been many stories made about me in the community already. It is not easy to live in a community that sets such high moral standard for single women like me. A slight deviation from such moral expectations can lead to us becoming labelled as prostitutes or seen as those desperate for sex.
Suppose there is a 32 year-old woman, crippled by polio, and has her mother as the only member of the family. The livelihood for her and her mother is sewing. The respectable Justice of Peace in the area offers his office to her to sell her products. Her business gives her a satisfactory profit to maintain her family. After sometime, the JP calls her at midnight and starts showing her nude pictures and tries to touch her. Unable to continue with the business at the JPs place, she moves to her home, despite the risk of losing her profits. She is unaware of laws that can help her take legal action. Are you familiar with this explanation 
Well laws can be brought about, but poor people like me cant use them. From where will we get the money to hire a lawyer and then how do we face the society Do we have evidence to prove these things Can I just tell the court that he showed me obscene pictures and touched me What would be the punishment then Even rapists are roaming around freely on the streets these days. When he gets out and wants to hurt me, who will protect me
What if a person is a widow with seven children and earns money to feed the family by making sweets and palmyrah products at home. During her attempts to reconnect the electricity line, the electricity board official whispers in her ear and inquires whether the connection is needed immediately. Since she answer in the affirmative, and having seven kids at home, he says that he would get her the connection, but she will have to do him a favour  the favour being to take care of his needs. As she misconceives the request to be a monetary bribe and asks how much he wants, he responds, you said you have seven children and you dont know what a man needs 
To this date, her house doesnt have electricity and her children study using kerosene lamps.The following sounds like another story which is familiar. 
We are surrounded by disgusting men like him. Just because I have seven children does not mean I am ever ready to have sex with these men. That man will burn in hell fire one day. I told my elder daughter and my mother-in-law about this and now I am telling you. Can anyone help me get electricity by telling this Why should I go around talking about this shameful event
These instances associated with sexual bribes were recalled by some of the women interviewed by the Centre for Equality and Justice (CEJ) as part of an exhaustive survey conducted in different parts of the island. The CEJ has observed the different contexts giving rise to these unfortunate incidents and the reasons behind those who suffered from these experiences not seeking legal advice. 

What is sexual bribery
Sexual bribery is an improper benefit that is sexual in nature, demanded from a person by men in positions of power in exchange for a service or a favour. It is a category under the overarching concept of sexual exploitation (the solicitation of a sexual act in exchange of remuneration) 

Reasons behind the increase in sexual bribery
According to the findings of a study, one obvious reason for sexual bribery of women in Sri Lanka is the patriarchal structure which is applicable to all communities irrespective of ethnicity. It was stated by a subject in the research, who is actively engaged in social and political activities, that women are merely sexual objects in the eyes of men and that females are not appreciated for the work they do.  Gender and ethnicity are other reasons which have given rise to sexual exploitation and bribery. This is particularly true in the war-torn areas where members of the police and the army abuse their power on Tamil women and control their ability to claim rights.  As observed in the study, most sexual bribery cases relate to women who are in vulnerable, destitute positions in life and have tried to access some kind of service from an institute. The absence of a man in their lives has added to their vulnerability and made them targets of men who take advantage of them and seek sexual favours. 
The increasing number of female-headed households caused due to the deaths or disappearances of male family members of war-affected families has also resulted in such women being sexually bribed and exploited. The study underscores the failure of the Government to investigate into and respond to such experiences. There are plenty of such instances associated with the process of resettlement and development plans where the participation of women in the decision making levels has seen women being victimized. The lack of gender-sensitivity in the judicial system along with the lack of efficiency in the law enforcement mechanisms in the country is also catalysts in this process. 

Stigma associated with sexual crimes
As it is evident from the instances mentioned in this article, CEJ observes in an analysis that many women did not even want to talk about the incident to a close friend or member of the family fearing that they would be found fault with for behaving inappropriately. In a few cases the mother, neighbour or mother-in-law have found fault with them with regard to their clothing or having gotten too close to the officer who has demanded sexual bribes. Single women fear that relating their experiences to someone would bring shame upon them because the community expects them to behave in a certain manner. Women with daughters also worry that the same fate would fall on them and would cause them problems when they marry. 

Laws relating tosexual bribery
Currently, in Sri Lanka, the only law which can be used at least remotely is the Bribery Act of 1954. The act criminalises the act of receiving and offering any gratification by a public officer as an inducement for performing a particular task. The punishment stipulated for such an act is a prison term not exceeding seven year and a fine not exceeding Rs. 5000. It is only vaguely possible from a positivist point of view that sexual bribes can be considered as a form of gratification within the meaning of the bribery act. A person if convicted of such an act will be subject to punishment. Yet, in Sri Lanka vs Abdul Rashak Kuthubdeen, it was held by the High Court that demanding sexual favours was held as being covered under the Bribery Act. The merely vague possibility of a sexual bribery to be considered a form of gratification within the meaning of the Bribery Act also discourages victims from reporting their experiences and making them unwilling to bring perpetrators before the authorities. 
The study reveals how people have lost their confidence in the justice system and believe that no good can come out of filing a case. There are grave concerns about lodging police complaints due to the corruption and sexism within these structures with police officers themselves requesting sexual favours. Many do not have a clear idea of where to make a complain and are unaware that sexual bribery is an offence. 

They keep the traumaticexperiences within
CEJ Project Coordinator Ando Anthappan said that in terms of the psychological impact on the women who have encountered these experiences, the impact is intensified by the fact that these women are reluctant to reach out to counselling institutions and relate their experiences. They suffer even more as they keep the traumatic experiences within. Most women tend to blame themselves because they were unaware that it is an offence. The institutions and structures in place are very limited and that is one of the compelling needs we have identified. There are a few places of access provided by the Government; the most accessible ones being the relevant units in Government hospitals, but they are not at all sufficient and sensitive to deal with these issues. We have got down some women to Colombo so that they can meet private psychiatrists here. They should do that, rather than access someone in their area for fear of social blame and because they feel ashamed, said Anthappan. 
Centre for Equality and Justice Executive Director Shyamala Gomez when contacted said, We have approached the Commissioner General of the Bribery Commission, but the common perception is that an amendment to the law is not necessary because of the recorded decision of the High Court where the Bribery Act was interpreted to include sexual bribery as well. But what we lobby for is to bring about a certainty and visibility in the law and acknowledge the issue. The Commissioner has gone public and made a statement calling for representations on what needs to be changed in the law and we seek to capitalize on that. We have also spoken to a member of the Law Commission of Sri Lanka who thoroughly approved our initiative and also assisted us in formulating a definition for sexual bribery to be hopefully adopted into the law. In addition, we have also approached the Human Rights Commission and have reached out to many Government and state officials including the Minister of Justice, said Gomes. When public officials demand for sexual favours in return for public service, those women are deprived of further rights and prevented from receiving the services these institutes provide. Female heads of households are preyed upon the most, in the absence of a male member in the family, added Gomez. 

The law that prevails is more than adequate
Legal, Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption Assistant Director Thanuja Bandara said, Although sexual bribery is not explicitly provided for in the Bribery Act, the law that prevails is more than adequate to make a claim to halt sexual bribery in Sri Lanka. We are currently in the process of receiving representations and proposals from the general public with regard to what changes need to be made to the law regarding bribery. There is a possibility that the meaning of the term gratification be expanded in due course. However, as it has been interpreted by the court, in the case of Kuthubdeen, there is no bar against considering sexual bribery as an offence under the current law. 
Asked about whether one decided case is sufficient to raise awareness among the public about the legal framework, Miss Bandara stated that in order for the public to know about it, awareness will have to be raised by other means.

Significance of Id-ul-fitr
	
Allah Almighty says in the glorious Quran:O you who believe, observing the fasting is prescribed for you as it was prescribed for those before you that you may become the pious
(Quran 2:183)
The Holy Quran makes it obvious by prescribing Ramadan fasting as one of the cardinal principles of Islam. The main object of fasting is to promote righteousness - a progressive cultivation of spiritual values.
Muslims throughout the world celebrate Id-Ul-Fitr (Ramadan Festival after ending fasting during the month of Ramadan.
Before the advent of Islam, Arabs used to celebrate certain days and occasions in an uncivilized way indulging in drinking gambling, adultery etc. But after Prophet Muhammad (PBUM), Islam changed that barbaric pattern of society and introduced a civilized refined and cultured way of celebrating.
Id-ul-fitr is the occasion to demonstrate self-discipline and moral consciousness earned through the devotional exercise of fasting during the holy month of Ramadan
The aim of Id-ul-fitr is to introduce a cultured form of celebration that offers the following benefits to mankind.
Id-ul-fitr gives the true picture of social equality when all the Muslims irrespective of caste, creed and colour, Wealth and position gather together and bow down before Allah the Almighty.
The only greatness in their mind is the greatness of Allah, which they also utter with their tongues.
Allah is the most Great, Allah is the most Great. None is worthy to be worshipped besides Allah. And (IU again declare) Allah is the most Great. Allah is the most Great.
On this great and happy occasion a Muslim does not forget the poor. Charity is the form of Sadagathul Fitr (Commonly known as Fitrah) is compulsory for all Muslims who have an adequate amount of wealth as prescribed in Islamic Law. Id-ul-fitr is the occasion to demonstrate self-discipline and moral consciousness earned through the devotional exercise of fasting during the holy month of Ramadan. To achieve real success in all circumstance in life a disciplined moral-self is indispensable. The day of Id is the starting point of that disciplined life which was fashioned in the form of tasting.
Id-ul-fitr is a valuable occasion through which Islamic values and culture could be transmitted from individual to individual.
At this juncture we must comprehend that social and spiritual bliss cannot be achieved without a strong inner conviction. Honesty cannot be advocated for other if we cannot practice it ourselves Love and affection cannot be strengthened if we ourselves cannot practice it.
Fasting builds up God-consciousness (Thaqwa) in out hearts and it trains ourselves to render a service to mankind.
Let us, therefore, on this important and significant occasion return to this natural and purified state in which God crated us. Let us from this day, Maintain this state freed from sins, so that we can truly without evil and distracting temptations that are reigning mankind. The difficulties of man cannot but by transforming himself from within.
It is only when man has found peace within himself and when he has built up the virtues of tolerance and discipline that he can radically approach and eliminate his problems and fasting helps us to this end. 
This Id-ul-fitr conveys the message of Social quality charity to the poor and self-discipline to all mankind irrespective of their social status and ethnic origins.
As this juncture it is our profound duty as free Muslims to transmit these noble values to other nations. May Allah guide us to achieve these noble aims and grant us the good of this world and the good in the hereafter.

UNP will nominate its own candidate for Presidential polls
	
Lands and Parliamentary Reforms Minister Gayantha Karunatilake speaks about the governments plan for the future and the next presidential election. The excerpts of the interview: 

There is bitterness between President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe. It seems to be high at the moment. How can the government proceed under such circumstances
This is a novel experience. We are going through a unique period. The two main parties that were hostile to each other got together for the first time to form the government. It is a gigantic task. At the beginning, some thought this political marriage would end up in divorce very soon. Yet, we have run the government for three years. We cannot rule out irritants to both sides during this period, though. However, the President and the Prime Minister have undertaken an arduous journey. We delivered a lot to the people. There are major changes introduced to the country after we took office. The public service is devoid of political influence today. There is media freedom. We delivered what we promised to the people. We increased Samurdhi benefits to people. We brought down fuel prices by a huge margin. We did not increase prices for three years. Despite the latest hike, fuel prices are still lower than what they were during the former rule. In fact, we increased payment for public servants by Rs.10,000 a month. 

Those involved in bond fraud should be exposed

Some within the government view the fuel price reduction and the Rs.10, 000 allowance for public servants as economically unwise decisions. What do you feel
There are such views. There is a view that we should have given this pay hike in steps. All in all, we lived up to what we promised to the people during the election time. We did not disregard our election promises after assuming office. We enacted the Right to Information Act. Even the United States says it is one of the best pieces of legislations in the world. We did a whole lot of development work. But, there was scant propaganda for it. The previous government managed to have a publicity blitz for what they did. Yet, we failed in this exercise. We need to carry out propaganda work. Ours is the only government that gave a nutrition package for expectant mothers. We introduced Suraksha insurance scheme for school children. If it had been done by the previous government, they would have won the hearts and minds of parents and children alike. But, our government did not have that ability in terms of propaganda for what it did. 

Again, some people believe that the enactment of the Right to Information Act only facilitated dissent against the government to be published in media. They say media freedom was too much. What is your view
It is viewed from different angles. From the peoples point of view , it is a commendable move. People have the right to know what is happening. It is a unique feature of democracy. We need such laws to root out corruption and frauds from society. I tried hard to bring it. I struggled for it even when I was in the opposition. The then government scuttled our move. It was anathema for the previous rule. Yet, the President and the Prime Minister brought this law fearlessly. 

If you say the government did so much, why was it defeated at the local government elections on February 10, 2018
We did a lot of work. Alongside, there were shortcomings which the people felt. 

All MPs haveto incurblame unnecessarily

What are those shortcomings
After the defeat, we had a review meeting to ascertain the reasons for the defeat. One is the failure to deliver fertilizer on time for the farming community. It is a serious matter for people living in the agriculture areas. People voted against the government as a result. 
Secondly, there were a whole lot of people denied of Samurdhi benefits due to political reasons. These people wanted us to ensure such benefits for them. We could not address it. We have got the Ministry now. We are acting to give such benefits to people who were discriminated due to political reasons. These are deserving people. 

What do you think of the electoral impact of the governments way of dealing with the UNHRC in Geneva
We successfully faced the UNHRC process in Geneva as a country. We fared well in the international arena. Our country had been portrayed in negative light internationally. We changed the situation. We won over the international community. We were entangled in a messy situation in Geneva. We untangled it. There was the talk of an electric chair to execute the leaders of this country. There is no such talk today. Internationally, we are back in action with all the stakeholders. At the last local polls, we received a signal from the people to correct our path. I am happy that we got it in advance. We have to read this message properly. 

There is a Presidential Election scheduled for the end of next year. How does the UNP look to it
Internally, the UNP discussed that the party should field its own candidate. That is the general situation. We will reveal the identity of the candidate when the election is declared. The Working Committee of the party has always been used to announcing it only after the elections are announced.

Candidates identity will be revealed only after the election is announced

However, the partys General Secretary Akila Viraj Kariyawasam said the Prime Minister would be the candidate. What is your view
There are instances where the Ministers make such remarks. Normally, our party is used to announcing the candidate only after the election is declared. 

It is widely perceived today that former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa will be the candidate from the other side. What do you think of his candidacy
It is advantageous for us if he comes forward as the candidate. The minority communities are strongly opposed to him. Likewise, people fear militarization under him. People respect the military for defeating terrorism. However, they have second thoughts on electing military personnel to govern the country. People respected former Army Commander Sarath Fonseka for his role in the elimination of terrorism. Yet, they were not ready to elect him to presidency. 

Have you started political work in view of the presidential elections
We have started some work after the latest reforms. There is a special politburo appointed. I was elected to it. Once a week we meet with the Prime Minister. The key office bearers are also present at such meetings. We discuss certain things there. We believe we can do a whole lot of things. We cannot transform a party within a day or two. We have ample time. During that time, we can correct ourselves. It will not be difficult for us to win the next elections. If you put together the votes polled at the local polls by the parties that were together at the presidential election, it was much higher than the number polled by Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP). 
At a presidential election, it will be advantageous for us as a result. 

In the name of reforms, we saw a change of certain office bearers. Do you believe the party should undergo policy reforms
Yes, of course. I believe even the party constitution should be changed. There were committees of back-benchers appointed to make recommendations on reforms. These recommendations should be taken into account. 

Realistically speaking, is it possible for you to unite the parties which were once together at the presidential election
As for the local government elections, it is more or less the same results we have got.

At the presidential election, President Sirisena and the UNP were together. Now, there is animosity between the two. What is your view
Only a handful of the SLFP backed us at the presidential elections. It is miniscule. There is enough time for us to get ready for the next election. In politics, even one day is a long period. At the local polls, it was a protest vote. We have got a message to correct ourselves. That is it. People expected us to punish those involved in corruption and frauds. We got a mandate for it. 

If Gota comes forward as candidate, it will be good for us

Yet, under the very same government, there was the bond scam. What do you feel about this scam that came out with evidence
I have no understanding about those responsible for it. We have only the information we got from the media. It is a huge black mark on the government. The opposition also played it up. If there is any fraud under whatever government, it has to be investigated. Our government did not try to sweep it under the carpet. The Presidential Commission was appointed. The Prime Minister also discussed it. He gave evidence before the Commission. The Commission appreciated it. In that context, we are happy. 
Politics has been relegated to the lowest ebb because of the latest findings with regard to the bond scam. 

Minister Dilan Perera has called Parliament Arjuna Aloysius and Company. You are the Chief Government Whip. What do you feel about it
There are allegations at the moment. It is better to reveal those responsible rather than keeping on making mere allegations. Otherwise, people are suspicious of MPs who are actually innocent in this case.
