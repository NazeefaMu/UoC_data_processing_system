Abe re-elected as Prime Minister after big election win
	
THE HINDU, 01st NOVEMBER, 2017- Japans Shinzo Abe was re-elected Prime Minister on Wednesday after his ruling blocs big election win last month and days ahead of a visit by U.S. President Donald Trump that is expected to be dominated by concerns over a volatile North Korea.
Mr. Abe, 63, took office in December 2012, promising to reboot the stale economy and bolster defence. His Liberal Democratic Party-led coalition retained its two-thirds super majority in parliaments lower house in the October 22 election, reenergising his push to revise the post-war, pacifist constitution.
Mr. Abe was expected to reappoint current cabinet ministers and tell them to compile an extra budget for the year to March 31, 2018 focusing on child care and boosting productivity.

Anarchy will reign if EP is abolished now: Champika
	
The Jathika Hela Urumaya (JHU) General Secretary Minister Chamipika Ranawaka said yesterday the country would end up in anarchy if the executive presidency was abolished without introducing a stable parliamentary system.
Speaking during the Constitutional Assembly on the proposals to draft a new Constitution, he said the good governance government had acted to curb the extreme powers of the executive presidency by enacting the 19th Amendment and made it more democratic. "Every sector in the country including the provincial council system would be into chaos, if the executive presidency was abolished. What is best for our country is to make the post more democratic," he said.
Minister Ranawaka said the clauses with regard to the unitary state in the Constitution should remain intact in all three languages, Sinhala, Tamil and English. "The unitary character of the State is vital for economic and political stability and to protect environmental sustainability and ensure social harmony. The problems faced by the Tamil people would not be resolved by devolving more powers to the Northern Provincial Council. It could be done only by the political parties representing Tamil people in the North working in conjunction with the central government to ensure success for their people," he said.
He said the ethnic and cultural identity of the Tamils living outside the North and Tamils and Sinhalese and Muslims living in the North could be ensured not through the provincial council system but by giving the necessary powers to the local government bodies.

Artist Vega shows England his love of land
	
Gets ready for the Edinburgh Fringe Festival scheduled to be held next year
Bearded artist Anup Vega is a misunderstood man. The appearance of a mystic, the scraggy thin physique and the wondering eyes he possesses have all contributed towards making all of us pop the question who is this man. 
This is what Vega had to endure when in England recently. Vega entertained the audience there by performing certain rituals accustomed to the farmer folks in Sri Lanka.
He had encountered certain issues at the airport, in England, when the authorities had queried why he had to carry a sackful of items which contained things like lamps, grains of rice and coconut flowers into the country
Vegas strength lies in his presentation, his talk and whatever he celebrates. Within a few minutes he was able to convince officials at the airport that what was in his sack was to be used for a presentation in visual art, the only presentation of this kind at the Edinburgh Music and Art Festival which was held at Sciennes Gallery Summerhall in England from August 2 to September 24. For the record among the artists invited for the festival there were five who were from Sri Lanka origin. 
The theme at the festival was Return in search of stillness. And the direction given to all artists was to make a return after World War 2. But return to what, responded Vega during an interview with the Daily Mirror. 
People dont have a clear idea as to what to return to. People now have money, possessions and power. But I feel that returning to the elementary level of life is the most precious, said Vega as he happily tucked into the rice, dhal and coconut sambol on his plate which comprised his breakfast that day. 
This writer met Vega for breakfast at a wayside restaurant on the road to the Sri Jayawardenepura Hospital. Vegas presentation, connected to the farmer folks, had appealed to the London audience. It was a vibrant show and the whole stage was made fragrant with some of the items he had burned.
I wanted to demonstrate some of the rituals practiced by the farming community because we have such a huge connection with the land. This connection with the land has been severed. Much of the rice Sri Lankans consume is imported now. There was a time when paddy was cultivated here and we used the first harvest for religious purposes. We miss this connection and now suffer, explained Vega. 
There are artists both in the East and the West. The Western artist wishes to move to Asia. On the surface there is contrast, but underneath the texture is the same. Ive noticed the confusion
Vega said that art in the West was associated with comedy and entertainment. This is why he choose to include visual art in his presentations. Most Asians prefer to settle in the West and have the notion that the opportunities and living standards are better there. There are artists both in the East and the West. The Western artist wishes to move to Asia. On the surface there is contrast, but underneath the texture is the same. Ive noticed the confusion. There is so much struggle due to desire, opined Vega. 
These were his thoughts on the West with this trip marking his first appearance in this part of the world. Asked whether he could bloom to his full potential as an artist, here in this island, Vega said, Sri Lanka is not my choice. I was born here. I have lived with ups and downs, he said. 
Vega said that he was elated that his London trip was sponsored by the British Council and Colombo Art Biennale. He was chosen as Sri Lankas first and sole representative at the Edinburgh Music and Art Festival by gallery owner Anoushka Hempel. Vega said that he was overjoyed due to the fact that a sponsors was interested in an artist at a time when corporates are running behind celebrity artistes and top sportsmen to obtain millage for their products. I must thank Anoushka Hempel for playing a huge role in choosing me for the festival, said Vega who is expected to make his second visit to London for the Edinburg Fringe Festival, next year. 
The day this writer met Vega happened to be his 50th birthday. This is an artist who kicked against receiving a classroom education and preferred nature to give him all his lifes lessons. During his 50 years on planet earth he has chosen to be self-taught. The human body has all what you need. Everybody is born with fully equipped senses, he said. Vega said that when he reflected on the years that have rolled by his description of the experience he has had shares similarities with the last words spoken by spiritual leader Osho (Baghavan Shree Rajneesh). Life is a dream, said Vega. 
Its easy to interview this high-profile artist because he seems to have dropped his ego. Another reason why anybody would want to spend some time with him is that there is a sense of celebration in whatever he does. The essence of my work is joy and celebration. Im happy for no reason, said the bearded artist who lives in Pannala and drives around in a rickety old Volkswagen van. 
His beard is lovely. There is sunshine in Vegas eyes. If one were to describe Vega, he prefers to wear a light cloth as his personality and not a heavy metal vest which most successful people today like to display as their personality when they present themselves in public. I like to be introduced as a natural human being, said Vega. 
While interviewing him this writer couldnt refrain from having a peep into those eyes of his which looked like gazing into the horizon. He was physically present here, but those eyes suggested that he was detached from this noisy world we all live in. 
People suspect me to be a criminal when I go to a place and sit there for hours, largely because of my dress and beard. They dont believe me when I say that Im just sitting there waiting to catch a glimpse of first rays of the morning sun, said Vega.

Aussie PM hails SL reconciliation programme
	
Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull today congratulated President Maithripala Sirisena for the great reconciliation programme undertaken by the Sri Lankan government, the Presidents Media Division said.
Mr.Turnbull said this when he held bilateral discussions with President Sirisena at the Presidential Secretariat in Colombo today.
Australian Premier thanked the President for excellent cooperation extended to fight transnational crimes including human smuggling and drug trafficking.
Heassured assistance to further develop Sri Lankas counter-narcotic capabilities.
Australia will also assist to setup aNational Defence College (NDC) in Sri Lanka.
Mr Turnbull said his government would depute a senior military officer for two years to provide administrative and curriculum expertise and to deliver select course modules to the NDC.
President Sirisena thanked the Australian Prime Minister for continuous assistance provided to Sri Lankas development activities and support extended at international forums.
He made a special mention about the field of drugs and narcotics and said that illegal drugs is a major problem for Sri Lanka.
He pointed out that because Sri Lanka is an island, many international narcotic cartels use this country as a hub for smuggling activities.
He thanked Australia for assisting Sri Lankas coastal security operations by providing fast naval patrol crafts in the last few years.
President Sirisena thanked Premier Turnbull for paying this visit to Sri Lanka, though the visit was brief.
Premier Turnbull said that he was glad he could visit Sri Lanka in this 70th anniversary year of diplomatic relations between the two countries.

Broad discussion on Constitution with Mahanayake Theras and people: PM
	
A broad discussion will be carried out on the New Constitution with the Mahanayaka Theras, other religious leaders and with the people as suggested by President Maithripala Sirisena, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe told the Constitutional Assembly today.
We will meet the Mahanayaka Theras and other religious leaders and the people. We will also talk with political parties as the President said. The ultimate objective would be to reach a national consensus. No one can rush for a new constitution as it is a time consuming activity. We will be able to complete all discussions only by the time the next Sinhala New Year. The discussions on the Constitution will have to be stopped during the time of the local government election early next year" the Prime Minister said while highlighting that a broad discussion is needed as per the resolution under which the constitutional assembly was established.
Mr. Wickremesinghe said the government is agreeable to most of the proposals submitted by the Joint Opposition with regard to the Constitution. "You say Ekiya Bawaya should be preserved we agreed to it. You say Provincial Councils should not seek to divide the country, Buddhism should be given the foremost place, Prime Minister should be elected by Parliament, Leader of Opposition should be elected by the Opposition MPs. We are agreeable to all these" he said.
Quoting the JO proposals that no Provincial Council should be allowed to merge with another Council, he said no Provincial Council could be allowed to merge unless the people in the entire country agree. "The number of PCs could be increased up to 10 or 15, or could be reduced to eight only if people want such a thing done. He said the government is open to discuss of other proposals of the Joint o\Opposition as well.
He then went on to explain about the Constitutional Assembly. I have to talk about the Constitutional Assembly. This was appointed through a resolution in Parliament. Some question about this assembly. The steering committee and other sub committees have come out with what they have discussed. All this will be put to the people and religious leaders before preparing the draft. Then it will be presented to the assembly. The Constitutional Assembly will become defunct if it is defeated. The draft will be put to Parliament after Cabinet approval if it is passed with a simple majority at the Constitutional Assembly. It will be presented to Parliament straight if it is passed by a two thirds majority in the assembly followed by other formalities," Mr. Wickremesinghe said.
He recalled that Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa sought a mandate to set up a constitutional assembly and so did the present government. "We also received a mandate to compile a new constitution. Political parties had got mandates for it. Therefore no one could say we are working against the mandate," he said.
The Prime Minister further recalled that several efforts were made to resolve the national issue in the past. He said Bandaranaike-Chelvanayagam Pact which proposed Rata Sabhas did not materialize in the 1950s while the Dudley-Chelva Pact which proposed district development councils suffered the same fate. "There was a protest against this pact and resulted in the killing of a Buddhist monk. "There would not have been an issue today if powers were devolved to district development councils. Unfortunately it could not be done as some went against it. Later the TULF claimed that they got a mandate to separate. Then there was bloody conflict. This conflict however came to an end but the national issue remained unresolved. Therefore, what we have to do is to make use of the opportunity we have before us and bring about a political solution" he said. (Yohan Perera and Ajith Siriwardana)

Buddhism foremost but other religions respected: SLMC
	
Sri Lanka Muslim Congress (SLMC) Leader Rauf Hakeem said yesterday they were not against giving priority to Buddhism in the new Constitution but also highlighted the need to include provisions where other religions are treated with dignity and respect.
"We are not against giving priority to Buddhism but provisions should be included in the constitution to ensure other religions are respected as well and include a ban to differentiate other religions," he said.
Speaking during the debate in the constitutional assembly, he said some people were creating fear among the people about unitary state, the place given to Buddhism, amalgamation of the North and East and a federal State.
"The Sri Lanka Bar Association (BASL) had raised several questions, including the unitary character of the State in the future. I am surprised to hear that a professional organisation like the BASL was posing such questions when it was clearly mentioned in the proposals. I suspect they were acting as a cat's paw to create a wrong opinion among the people," he said.
He said the amalgamation of the North and East was just an alternative proposal of the Tamil National Alliance (TNA) and added that it does not mean that the proposals highlighted the need to do so.
"The TNA has a right to make such a proposal. We have discussed the matter with the TNA. But Tamil leaders have said that they would not do so without seeking the opinion of the people in the East," he said. (Ajith Siriwardana and Yohan Perera)

Former president and MP, Mahinda Rajapaksa said today the time allocated to the joint opposition for the debate on the interim report submitted by the Steering Committee was not sufficient.
He said the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) and the Tamil National Alliance (TNA) were two political parties behind the conspiracy to form the unity government and the joint opposition was the only true opposition party in parliament.
"The JVP and the TNA are engaged in the conspiracy to draft the constitution. The joint opposition which is the true opposition got only about 15 minutes to speak during the debate. Speeches are lined up as UNP, TNA and SLFP and JVP. We get only a few speeches. I stayed the whole day on Wednesday and left," he claimed.
Responding to these allegations Leader of the House, Lakshman Kiriella said 829 minutes had been allocated to the opposition while 673 minutes was allocated to the government.
He said 228 minutes was allocated to the joint opposition. (Ajith Siriwardana and Yohan Perera)

Ceylinco Life Managing Director R. Renganathan (left) receives the FALIA Grandmaster plaque in Colombo


The Foundation for the Advancement of Life & Insurance Around the world (FALIA) Japan, recently hosted the alumni get together in Sri Lanka, at which the title of Grandmaster was conferred on Ceylinco Lifes Managing Director R. Renganathan.
The FALIA get-together was attended by past attendees of FALIA seminars, three dignitaries from Japan, Messrs Toru Nagashima, Managing Director FALIA, Takashi Matsumoto, a former President of FALIA and President of the Federation of National Public Service Personnel Mutual Aid Associations and Yoshitaka Masai, Director of FALIA, and Indrani Sugathadasa, Chairperson of the Insurance Board of Sri Lanka (IBSL).
The life time honorific of Grandmaster recognises three decades of leadership in the development and growth of the life insurance industry in Sri Lanka during which Renganathan set up and steered Ceylinco Life, taking the company to market leadership in 2004, a position it has retained to date.
Over the past 47 years, FALIA has contributed very significantly to the development of life insurance in Asia, Renganathan said. It has helped build the knowledge base of the industry through seminars and training. Ceylinco Life has implemented many learnings from these seminars and I am honoured to be appointed Grandmaster.
As the first and only FALIA Grandmaster in Sri Lanka, Renganathan will liaise with FALIA Japan and the local insurance industry and promote the principles and activities of the Foundation.
A Fellow of CA Sri Lanka and a Fellow of the Institute of Certified Management Accountants of Sri Lanka, Renganathan has functioned as Managing Director/CEO of Ceylinco Life since the companys inception in January 1988.
FALIA was established in March 1970, byDai-ichi Life to further promote the mission of contributing to the development of Asias insurance industry and in doing so to reciprocate some of the generosity received from Europe and the United States after World War II. In April 2012, FALIA was officially certified as a public interest incorporated foundation.

For the love of quizzing, or Angelo Rozairos lesson
	
Angelo Rozairo, who taught French at my school, was the wittiest teacher I ever encountered. He had that rare ability to turn the most banal sayings downside up, to disrupt the processes and structures which organisations flaunted in the name of order, to defend his students if they ever had been misunderstood by authorities. He had a big enough heart and a big enough mind too: open to virtually every field of activity a language could open anyone up to, he could refer to anything substantive, be it from his subject to the latest movie. Teachers like that are rare though. Sadly. 
I remember a particular evening at the school canteen, a few weeks after the Quiz Club had organised an inter-house competition which had, all in all, not gone very well. Monsieur Rozairo, as we called him then, had read the souvenir I had hastily put together for the occasion.
Buried deep within that souvenir was a message I had even more hastily penned: a banal, pretentious essay on the importance of knowing facts, understanding the world, and so on. Monsieur Rozairo had read it, and as I entered the canteen, he stopped me, grinned, and pointed out to me to something I had written in that essay: that true knowledge, like true wisdom, can never harm or unduly benefit anyone. In hindsight that was a rather stupid point to make. But I am digressing. 
Monsieur looked at me, quoted what I had written, and informed me point-blank and candidly, Knowledge is not a weapon, you say. It is not a tool to expropriate from others, you say. But thats knowledge as you understand it, with respect to harmless statistics. Theres a body of knowledge that is a weapon and can expropriate.
Its called blackmail. This was new to me of course, not least of all because it never occurred to me that blackmail could constitute knowledge. Looking back now, I believe that was a failure on my part: knowledge resists compartmentalisation. It includes everything. It excludes nothing, and it opens one to anything, as it should. 
The rift between knowledge and wisdom is so tight that no one, not even a dim-witted halfwit, would consider challenging it. And to a considerable extent, there is a great deal of truth in that dichotomy: while knowledge, as we understand it today, has been reduced to parroting out facts and figures, wisdom entails application, discrimination, analysis, more than mere comprehension.
Its easy to know, tougher to know how to apply what one knows. In turn this is rooted in the rather terrible dichotomy between the thinkers and the doers in our society: the former know what kind of nail your Monet or Degas needs to stay pinned on the wall, while the latter will not know but will be ready to comply with whatever nail is given to them. Which brings me to the subject of this piece: the function and place of quizzes and quiz clubs in our society. 
First and foremost, there are more table quizzes (my definition: a series of rounds whether clearly or vaguely defined which get participants to pen down answers around a table) in here than there ever were before. This sudden proliferation, obviously, has to do with the mass culture we have institutionalised.
Probably no one would have imagined the kind of populist quizzes aired on television today, or those reality shows that test and reward what one knows in front of a live audience. There are traditions embedded in these competitions, however, which not even the most glamorous, technically novel reality show can flounder. In large part, these traditions have been kept and sustained by clubs which bear a long history. Particularly in our schools. 
On Tuesday, November the 7th the General Knowledge Club of Royal College, Colombo will unveil the 27th Blue and Gold Quiz, the longest running school quiz in this country. Incidentally, the Club itself is not the oldest, since that distinction belongs (I believe) to the Club at Richmond College, Galle. Whatever the number of years, the length, or even the distinctions, historical or otherwise, however, these competitions help us understand how the culture of quizzing evolved in Sri Lanka, or for that matter in the world, from a series of casual flings to what it has become today. 
The Blue and Gold Quiz differs from most other quizzes, whether organised by school societies or private institutions, with respect to its format: while most competitions are categorised into rounds dedicated to particular themes (Current Affairs, History, Geography) this tournament is more or less scattered with rounds that dont follow such themes and are a veritable mishmash of written down queries and audio and video clips.
While this can disconcert, it also can push the unwary quizzer: if he has come expecting certain questions to follow a certain format, he will be sorely disappointed, but at the same time his mind will be more sharpened and pitted against every other competitor. Its an exhilarating, open textured format, in other words, refreshingly random, though it has attracted its share of flak over the years. 
27 years isnt a long time when considering that quizzing in Sri Lanka boasts of a longer, richer history, but it is relevant considering that its inception coincides with the flowering of a cohesive culture of quizzing. The oldest school quiz club, as I mentioned earlier, was established at Richmond College somewhere in the late fifties (1957, if I am not mistaken, in which case 2017 marks its 60th anniversary). 
It was from Richmond College that two prominent quizzing personalities emerged. The first of these, Shelton Wirasinha, who later wound up as Principal at Wesley College, became the first Quiz Master in Sri Lanka, when in the 80s he hosted a quiz programme, a must-watch show from the day it started in 1982 to its demise three years later (when Wirasinha passed away). The quiz programme (followed by its Sinhala variant, Soyamu Pilithuru, hosted by Gunaratne Abeysekera) had among its more illustrious participants Saliya Pieris, who won second place in 1984 and who has now become one of Sri Lankas most well-informed fundamental rights lawyers. 
The 80s and the 90s were clearly tumultuous decades and this in particular owing to the rise and maturing of television. It is television, then, that salvaged quizzing, though ironically it was overwhelmed and taken over by the traditional table format we see today, at our schools or at private institutions ranging from the banking to the telecommunications industry. That the Blue and Gold Quiz which began in 1990, then, is not coincidental: the truth is that television had saved our quizzers, but only for a short while. With the turn of the millennium, and the entry of the World Quizzing Championships in Sri Lanka, we returned to the conventional table tournament. 
Which begs the question, naturally: in a context where everything and anything is at our beck and call through the internet, do quiz shows matter Yes and no: yes because Google has all but completely trivialised the need to recall, and no because the argument that the webscape is a substitute for our memory is fallacious since a) it means we are depending on technology, which shouldnt be the case anyway, and b) itis no different to saying that we must let go of the need to remember mathematical calculations and equations because of (what else) calculators.
This latter point was conceded by the second prominent quizzer that Richmond College bred: Lathikka Niriella, currently the Number One Quizzer in Sri Lanka, whose story I will get to. Soon. In this newspaper. For the time being, though, here are some final reflections. 
Like I noted before, there are more school quizzes being inaugurated here than ever before. Two reasons account for this: one, the proliferation of TV shows that market quiz shows like hotcakes, and two, the solid base the activity has been blessed with, thanks to earlier quiz shows organised by older schools.
Whatever the part of the country  from the North to the South  quizzing is an intensely fascinating activity which continues to take in more and more members each year. The fact that the General Knowledge Club remains among the five most popular extracurricular activities at Royal College is a testament to this. I believe the same can be said of Clubs and Societies in other schools, elsewhere. With one caveat: if they arent maintained, if they are made to privilege age and seniority over interest and enthusiasm, they cannot and will not see through the long term properly. That is why there are selection procedures and why students are trained from a young age. 
Magnus Magnusson, who died 10 years ago after a lifetime spent hosting what was then the leading TV Quiz Show, BBCs Mastermind, once quipped on the controversy surrounding memorising nuggets of information: To my mind, there is no such thing as knowledge not worth knowing. This raises another question: should quizzes test you on knowledge alone After all, Ive come to appreciate more hardy questions, the sort that asks you, If a peacock lays three eggs in one hour, how many eggs can it lay in three and laughs at you when you answer Nine when the correct answer should have been Peacocks dont lay eggs, stupid! Perhaps these quizzes, including the Blue and Gold, will get us closer to them. And perhaps what Monsieur Angelo Rozairo told me holds true: theres nothing that cant be called knowledge.

Girl searches for her father in her previous birth
	
Dharshini Navandana Weerakoon, is the third child of Sepalika Ariyawasa and W.M. Weerakoon, a retired serviceman living in Hatharaliyadda.
When she became three years, she could talk about her previous birth and a change in her behaviour too could be noticed. 
She began to question from everyone whom she met to help find her father. Her attitudes when choosing scrumptious meals and fabulous dresses cast a doubt to her parents that whether she was trying to recall about her life in her previous birth. But they did not want to talk or remind her about what they had noticed due to the fear of losing the child.
The parents also noticed little Dharshini kept questioning about her father from the children whom she played with and even from the pigeons and other birds that perched in the compound. She started looking at the sky and asking whether her father could hear her. 
I was seated in the front seat. After passing Botanical Gardens, our cab collided with a bowser and it caused a huge shock to me, and that was all I remembered
As this story reached us, we visited their house on last poya day and asked her who was her father, where was he and what was he doing Then she responded and said My fathers name was Wickramanayake and he taught in Peradeniya campus after he quit the Army. I had three elder sisters and four elder brothers. We were living in a two-storey house near the Peradeniya Botanical Gardens with my mother. I travelled to Hemamali Girls School in a black coloured car owned by my father. 
Our house was protected by a parapet wall and it was blue in colour. It was very beautiful. We used to enjoy watching the Mahaveli River from upper floor of the house. The house had a gate which was black in colour and the dog that we had was also black. 
There were helpers in our house and a driver was also with us. My mother and my elder sister were teaching at Hemamali Vidyalaya and the other elder sister was a nurse.
My elder brothers studied at Dharmaraja and at St. Sylvesters colleges. After getting through my examinations, I entered the Peradeniya university. My father tried his best to fulfil my aim to become a doctor. I was in the team that carried out postmortem examinations in the medical faculty. Finally, after passing all the relevant exams, I became a doctor and joined the Kandy General Hospital. I had many friends there. I do not remember their names now. I was wearing sarees, jeans and frocks during my duty hours. When I received my salary, I used to go to Kandy with my mother and buy clothes. I gave clothes to my siblings too. 
One day, we visited the Pinnawala elephant orphanage in Rambukkana. There I saw some tourists probably they were from Australia who were talking to my father. One of them, while chatting with my father, was looking at me.
On our return from Pinnawala, my father told me that one of the Australian tourists was interested in marrying me, and asked what my opinion was. I agreed because he was a young and smart-looking guy and expressed my willingness to go to Australia as well.
Our marriage took place in a hotel in Kandy. He stayed with us for a month and later we flew to Australia, stayed there for little over a week and returned to Sri Lanka. His parents liked me very much and bought clothes for me. Australia was a very beautiful country. 
After a period of several years, I was conceived and gave birth to a baby boy. We named him Manju. My mother was taking care of my son after her retirement. I continued my duty at the hospital as usual. 
One day, in 2003, I paid a visit to my aunt who was in Peradeniya in our red coloured cab. I was seated in the front seat. Just after passing the Botanical Gardens, our cab collided with a bowser which was carrying water and it caused a huge shock to me, and that was all I remembered. 
As she was finding it difficult to live in this poor surrounding, she was pleading us to offer help to find her father. Nevertheless, her (present) parents also loved her so much. 
When we asked Weerakoon (father), he said he had noticed her crying at nights and saying that she wanted her father and her son Anju. Her behaviour was so peculiar.
Whenever we admonished her for some reasons, she would begin to weep and said her father had never scolded her and he was so loving. She did not like to see me wearing short sleeved shirts, T-shirts or sarongs. She preferred costly and scrumptious food. Once I came home with a bag of vegetables, she threw them away saying that she did not like them. 
One day we took her to Peradeniya and searched for her so-called whereabouts in her previous birth, according to information provided by her. When we went to Rajopavanarama Temple at Gatambe, she said that she used to visit this temple with her father. We spoke to the prelate of the temple too, but was not successful in getting any clue to the question.
She tore the application for admission to Hatharaliyadda primary school and said that she did not like to go to poor schools and preferred to study at Hemamali Vidyalaya. Weerakoon requested from anyone who had any evidence about this, to contact him on his mobile phone (0755435730).
My fathers name was Wickramanayake and he taught in Peradeniya campus after he quit the Army. I had three elder sisters and four elder brothers
Her mother Sepalika expressed similar views. If she would see some one in front of her house, she would ask whether they were going to Kandy, and whether she could accompany them, and never forgot to tell them to bring her father back. She likes to go to school and to the temple. She wants to observe Sil on every poya day. However, at times she was in tears asking for her father. She likes to be left alone. The cream of her fathers earnings is spent on her. When she heard the sound of an aircraft, she jumps out of the house and screams at it to take her to Australia. 
We are still trying to bring her back to her present life, said Sepalika.

New Constitution brought to repress burning issues - JO
	
The main purpose of the government in bringing a New Constitution is to divert the mindset of the people and repress the burning issues of the country, UPFA MP Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena said yesterday.
Addressing a media briefing, he said that there were more significant issues to be addressed rather bringing a new Constitution and added that the government had totally neglected the mandate given by the people in 2015.
We dont say that the new Constitution is not topical. But the fact is that the government should show more keenness on the issues prevailing unsolved in the country. People charge that the cost of living is intolerable. Thus, more consideration should be given to the matters pertaining to the people, Abeywardena stressed.
He proceeded to say that people are burdened with massive tax payments as a result of the Bond scam which plundered billions of rupees of people's money. (Sheain Fernandopulle)

NEW YORK TRUCK ATTACKER WHO KILLED 8  WAS A LONE WOLF
	

Investigators probing the background of the 29-year-old man they say mowed down pedestrians and cyclists on a Manhattan bike path believe he was a lone wolf who radicalized domestically after coming to the United States, New York Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo (D) said Wednesday. 
Cuomo said the attacker became influenced by the Islamic State and its violent tactics after arriving in this country from Uzbekistan. Officials say the suspected attacker, Sayfullo Saipov, left a note declaring his allegiance to the group, but authorities have not found any connections between him and the Islamic State or any other organization. 
The evidence shows . . . that after he came to the United States, was when he started to become informed about ISIS and radical Islamic tactics, Cuomo said during an appearance on CNNs New Day, using one of the acronyms for the group. We have no evidence yet of associations or continuing plot or associated plots, and our only evidence to date is that this was an isolated incident that he himself performed. 
Officials say Saipov climbed into a rental truck and careened down a path along Hudson River on Tuesday afternoon, slamming into numerous people before he was wounded by police and taken into custody. 
At least eight people were killed  among them, five Argentines and a Belgian  in what became New Yorks deadliest terrorist attack since Sept. 11, 2001. Eleven more people were injured along a path of carnage in Lower Manhattan, a route that was strewn with bodies, wreckage and scattered personal items.

Orumitta nadu or ekiya it is not that important: Douglas
	
An unwanted debate has started with regards to the meaning of the Tamil word 'orumitta nadu' and its Sinhala meaning, the word 'ekiya' when it refers to the nature of State proposed in the interim report on Constitution. This debate will create unrest among both Sinhalese and Tamils alike, MP Douglas Devananda told the constitutional Assembly yesterday.
" Harping on these words is unnecessary as including the word 'orumitta nadu' does not mean minorities would get more powers and 'ekiya' does not mean they get less powers" he pointed out. " Some people are named Ganesan after god Gnaapathi, but that does not turn that person into a God " he added.
He said this issue had made things so complicated that even the Maha Nayakes are perturbed over it.
The EPDP leader called for the 13th Amendment to the Constitution to be implemented fully. "The Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution should be implemented even if a new Constitution is enacted. If not the necessary changes should be made to the Constitution," he added. (Yohan Perera and Ajith Siriwardana)

PM required to testify before Bond Commission
	
The Presidential Commission of Inquiry (PCoI) investigating the controversial Issuance of Bonds today said it requires the testimony of Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe in order to "obtain a few clarifications and any other evidence which may be necessary".
Issuing a statement at the commencement of the today's session, the Commission noted that it had perused the affidavit given to the Commission by the Prime Minister and that the Commission had certain clarifications to be made.
"With regard to the questions forwarded to the Hon. Prime Minister by this Commission of Inquiry, we have received an affidavit affirmed to by the Prime Minister. The Commissioners have carefully perused this affidavit and we would like to obtain a few clarifications and any other evidence which may be necessary. Therefore, we will be requesting the Hon. Prime Minister to attend a Hearing of this Commission of Inquiry for that purpose" the statement said.
Accordingly, the Commission said that the date at which the Prime Minister would be required to attend the hearing would be notified in due course after ascertaining "with the Prime Ministers office the availability of the Hon. Prime Minister"
Submitting the affidavit, the Prime Minister earlier expressed his willingness to appear before the commission if necessary. The PCoI yesterday said the decision to summon the Prime Minister was made after thoroughly perusing the affidavit.
Although the statement issued earlier in the day said that the only other hearing would be for the purpose of the testimony of the Prime Minister, it was decided last evening that the Commission would conduct hearings on November 16.
The final report of the commission is due on December 8. In its statement the Commission said that it had to analyse lengthy testimonies of over 70 witnesses and over 450 documents are required prior to December 08, at which point the mandate of the Commission ends.
Full statement:
Statement made on November 2, 2017:
The Commission of Inquiry is holding this special Hearing today for the specific purpose of recording the evidence of a few more witnesses. This evidence has been obtained by the officers of the Hon.
Attorney Generals Department who are assisting this Commission of Inquiry. We have agreed with the submission made by the officers of the Hon. Attorney Generals Department, that this evidence may be relevant to our investigation and inquiry in terms of our mandate. That is why, despite the limited time available to us to prepare and finalize our report, we have decided to hold this special Hearing today.
With regard to the questions forwarded to the Hon. Prime Minister by this Commission of Inquiry, we have received an affidavit affirmed to by the Hon. Prime Minister. The Commissioners have carefully perused this affidavit and we would like to obtain a few clarifications and any other evidence which may be necessary. Therefore, we will be requesting the Hon. Prime Minister to attend a Hearing of this Commission of Inquiry for that purpose. The date on which that Hearing will be held, will be decided in due course and will be notified in the usual manner.
When deciding that date, we have to take in to account the fact that, Justice Jayawardena is recovering from surgery held on 17 October and finds it difficult to attend another Hearing for the next two weeks or so. Further, we think it appropriate to consult the Hon. Prime Minister office to ascertain the availability of the Hon. Prime Minister, when fixing the date of the Hearing.
Finally, at present, we are working very hard to prepare and finalize our report before our Mandate ends on
8 December, 2017
. As mentioned earlier, this complex task requires us to consider the evidence of over 70 witnesses, many of whom have given very lengthy testimonies and to analyse over 450 documents, many of which consist of a large number of pages. All this material has to be carefully read, understood and evaluated in order to make the findings and recommendations which are set out in the Mandate issued to us.(Shehan Chamika Silva)

Repealing PTA: EU says disappointed over slow progress
	
The visiting four-member delegation of the European Parliament today expressed disappointment over the governments failure to execute the assurance given last year to replace the Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA), a requirement for granting GSP+.
The delegation of members of the European Parliament (MEP) led by Jean Lambert arrived in Sri Lanka on Tuesday to explore Sri Lanka's progress on national reconciliation and its implementation of the international conventions applicable to GSP+ concession.
Addressing a news briefing held at the Embassy of the European Union (EU) in Colombo, Ms. Lambert said the higher-ups in the government assured in 2016 when they visited Sri Lanka that the PTA would be replaced with a legislature which is up to international Human Rights standards.
We were told it will be done. We were under the impression that there will be rapid change but there isnt. We hope once the Budget process is out, Parliament will take measures to change this piece of legislature, she said.
She said only because the GSP+ concession was granted, it doesnt mean that the recipient could sit back and relax.
The MEPs expressed concern that the progress achieved has been slower than originally hoped, but that the foundations for that progress were now mostly in place.
The delegation welcomed a number of positive developments that have taken place since their last official visit, such as the decision to readmit Sri Lanka to its preferential trade programme GSP+ and the lifting of the ban on Sri Lankas fisheries exports to the EU market. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

While stating that the latest stand taken by the government regarding the SAITM cannot be regarded as the final solution to the issue, the GMOA today said that they need further clarification on the proposed steps.
The government announced on Sunday that it had decided to abolish the SAITM and convert it into a non-profit making institution coming under the University Grants Commission (UGC).
GMOA Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge told a news conference that there were several points to make clarifications and amendments even though some positive facts were included in the given decision.
He said that the GMOA was attempting to find a final solution to the SAITM issue through the decision given by the government recently.
This decision was announced by the Director General of the Government Information Department. We hope that this decision is the one which President Maithripala Sirisena has guaranteed to provide. We have requested for a discussion with President Sirisena for further clarification several days before. We did not receive a positive response to it yet, he added.
He said that the GMOA was ready to take a step forward by discussing these facts with the government and added that it was questionable whether the government was ready for it.
He said that they would wait a few days for a positive response from President Sirisena and other related authorities with regard to the issues they had raised before and added that the decisive decisions would be taken following the GMOAs Central Committee which would be meeting on Monday.

Sammana account holders can obtain pension on any day they wish: Pan Asia Bank DGM
	
Pan Asia Sammana Account was specially introduced for all pensioners who have given their best years for the country and are now enjoying life in retirement. As a result of the increasing popularity of this product, the bank recently decided to add several new value-added features to same. To uncover more about Pan Asia Sammana account, the following question and answer session was conducted with Nalaka Wijayawardana Deputy General Manager-Marketing and Personal Banking.
Could you explain Sammana pension loan scheme
A few years ago, banks were not very keen on giving out loans to pensioners. Pan Asia Bank realizing this problem set an example for the whole country by coming forward with the Sammana pension loan scheme.
We realized that these individuals who have basically given their lives to serve Sri Lanka still had much more to contribute towards economic development of their country.
We also realized that these individuals had a strong desire and an ability to carry on their lives without being a burden to the country or their own children. It is in light of those reasons that we introduced the Sammana pension loan scheme.
This scheme enables a pensioner to divert his/her pension to Pan Asia Bank and obtain a loan of up to 2 million.
A special feature of this account is the fact that the loan repayment period could be extended up to 10 years. Another unique feature of this loan is that it does not require guarantors.

As a result of introducing this account what progress have you seen
By now, we have facilitated a large number of loans. This has helped many pensioners earn an additional income through self-employment.
The fact that these people dont become a burden to anyone and have the ability to financially support their children and contribute positively to the national economy is source of great pride for us. There are also some who obtain this loan to fulfil their duties towards their children such as bearing the cost of their weddings. Then there are others that utilize this loan scheme to go on pilgrimages. Another special feature is that they get an insurance cover when they take a loan.
Therefore, in an unfortunate event of the demise of a loan applicant, rest of the family is protected as they are not burdened with the repayment of the loan.

What are the new benefits recently introduced into this account
The pension is received on a predetermined day of the month. If a financial emergency arises between two pension payment dates most people find themselves in quite a difficult state.
To help in emergencies such as these, we have introduced a facility by which an interest-free pension advance may be obtained at a nominal fee. As a result, a pensioner could obtain an advance on their pension on any day by visiting any branch of the bank. The maximum a person may borrow through this service is Rs. 30,000 and the minimum is Rs 5000.

What are the other benefits these account holders get
Apart from the above mentioned benefits, we have also introduced a discount scheme for Sammana accountholders.
As a result, they can enjoy great discounts at selected bookshops, opticians and insurance companies etc.

What are the eligibility criteria to get one of these loans
Government pensioners under age of 70 with a monthly pension of Rs. 10,000 or more may instruct their pension to be credited to a Pan Asia Bank Sammana account to avail themselves of those benefits.

How does one get more information and details about this account
Customers can call the banks 24x7/365 customer contact centre on 0114 667 222, or they can visit any Pan Asia Bank branch to get more details.

Senators blast Facebook, Twitter, Google in Russia probe
	

THE HINDU, 01st NOVEMBER, 2017-
Exasperated U.S. senators harshly criticized representatives of Facebook, Twitter and Google at a hearing on Tuesday for not doing more to prevent Russian agents interfering with the American political process as early as 2015. At one point, Sen. Al Franken shook his head after he couldnt get all the companies to commit to not accepting political ads bought with North Korean currency.
The hearing by a subcommittee of the Senate Judiciary panel was moved last week into a cavernous hearing room usually reserved for high-profile events like Supreme Court confirmations. About 50 people waited to get in as senators fired pointed questions and waved at cardboard displays of outrageous ads.
People are buying ads on your platform with rubles. They are political ads, Franken fumed. You put billions of data points together all the time. ...Google has all knowledge that man has ever developed. You cant put together rubles with a political ad and go like, Hmmm, those data points spell out something pretty bad

Things worse for SL if Nat'l question ignored-Leader of the Opposition
	
Things will get worse for Sri Lanka especially in the international arena if the country fails to address the National question, Leader of Opposition R Sampnanthan told the Constitutional Assembly yesterday.
"Sri Lanka knows very well that all the problems it has faced in the international arena, particularly since 2012, is because of its failure to manfully address the National question. Things can only get worse; they cannot get any better if the same attitude remains," Sampanthan said.
"Sri Lanka was able to garner the support of all the important players including the US, European Union and India to defeat the LTTE. The LTTE was banned in all these countries as a result. You made it look to the world that the LTTE terrorists were an impediment to a finding a political solution for the country. You assured the world that an acceptable political solution would be found after the defeat of the LTTE. Ask yourselves whether you can abandon the said assurances and commitments you made to the world," he added.
The Tamil people of the North-East have been absolutely clear in regard to the manner and mode of power sharing. They have advocated a federal arrangement within a united, undivided country in a united Tamil speaking North East region comprising the Northern and Eastern provinces" he added.

Time to give school authorities lessons in pregnancy!
	
There is a popular saying that the best things in society are for childrens use. Despite the presence of many human rights organizations, Womens Groups and NGOs involved in the protection of the childrens rights- especially those of girls- there are less affluent families who suffer enormously due to misdirected priorities of the authorities. It is ironic that the children who are entitled to education have lost this basic right. This is one such tragic tale about the suffering of a female student with the connivance of the Government authorities.
This student had been expelled from her school recently by the disciplinary committee of the school under the impression that she was pregnant. What had led the authorities at the school to take such a decision was her vomiting inside the school premises. The vomiting had been caused because she had attended school that day without having breakfast. She was a grade 10 student of Madatugama Rewatha Maha Vidyalaya in Kekirawa. The Human Rights Commission in Colombo had informed the girls parents in writing to present the student for further investigations. 
The students mother, D.M.Somawathi( 57), said that she had never been to Colombo. Her father N.H. Kiribanda (66) said that he had been to Colombo Fort area in the 1940s to engage in the job of unloading vegetables from lorries. 
The problem these parents face is that they arent in a position to bear even the bus fares necessary to travel to Colombo. This is because they have got used to eking out a living through manual labour. The monies raised this way barely suffice for them to have one meal a day. We went to their house on October 28 (Saturday) evening in order to show their house to three people with lion hearts who arrived from Trincomalee to provide this family with food stuff after having read their woeful story in the newspaper. 
It was only then that we went to Dambulla Hospital. The doctors in that hospital were like Gods. They proved that the allegations levelled against her were false. The fire that had inflamed in my mind had extinguished
At that time, the girl, who had suffered this injustice, and her mother were at home. The mother told us that her daughter wasnt given an opportunity to be enrolled in a school so far. Her mother revealed that several teachers had decided to leave this school if the teachers and parents association decided to readmit the girl concerned back to the school. 
When we inquired from the mother whether this student has a pair of shoes, a school bag and clothes to attend school, they displayed the pair of shoes she used. The shoes were in a pathetic condition. 
She said that her daughter now had no school to attend and that the principal nor any other person had told them that a school will be provided for her daughter. Her former class teacher had promised to take her back, but nothing has happened so far
Her father Kiri Banda said that his family, which lives in the throes of poverty, had to face innumerable hardships. He said that as a result of having to travel to Anuradhapura and Dambulla Police stations regarding various investigations, he was denied of the opportunity to earn his daily wages. 
He further said that he wished there was an inquiry against the teacher who influenced the principal to expel her daughter from school. He added that the principal had merely signed the leaving certificate and the directive to expel her had been carried out by another teacher. 
A young woman who came from Trincomalee had given them Rs.1000 so that they could reach Colombo, as requested by the Human Rights Commission. 
It was on October12 while we were working that we were summoned by the school. Then, another teacher told us that our daughter was pregnant and she could not be kept in school. The teacher concerned scolded us thoroughly and compelled us to remove her from the school. It was only then that we went to Dambulla Hospital. The doctors in that hospital were like Gods. They proved that the allegations levelled against her were false. The fire that had inflamed in my mind had extinguished, said the girls mother. 
She said that her daughter now had no school to attend and that the principal nor any other person had told them that a school will be provided for her daughter. Her former class teacher had promised to take her back, but nothing has happened so far. She had gone to Anuradhapura for various investigations, spending hard earned money, and had to return home starving. 
I have never been to Colombo. Nor have I seen Colombo. How can we get to Colombo We dont know where the Human Rights Commission is. It is a great help if somebody accompanies us to our destination. If we dont go, they would say that our girl is guilty. It is a great trouble. We dont know what we should do, the girls mother said. 
We dont want anything more than a school for our daughter to sit for her examination. The principal was extremely sad regarding this issue because she was the one who gave the leaving certificate. But it was another teacher who scolded her. I had to leave and was unable to listen to what he had told. He spoke in an insulting manner. The parents and the teachers who had participated in the meeting, conducted by the disciplinary committee, had planned to blame us. Nobody spoke to us. We were named as the wrong doers along with the gentlemen who represented the electronic and print media. They blamed us accusing us of creative this situation. We dont harbour a grudge against the principal despite she having signed the leaving certificate of our daughter. This was done under the influence of another teacher. However, we have become the wrongdoers in the end. What can we do This is the outcome of abject poverty, the girls father said. 
Perspectives of professionals 
Children should be afforded the dignity and worth of the human person-Marini De Livera- Chairperson of the National Child Protection Authority (NCPA) 
While this isnt the first time a childs rights have been violated, this incident will certainly be talked about in the history of child rights violations. Speaking to NCPA Chairperson Marini De Livera, the Daily Mirror inquired about the actions taken so far by the authority regarding this incident. The NCPA must take action, so that a similar incident could be prevented from from occurring. 
The preamble of the United Nations Child Rights Convention that Sri Lanka is party to, eloquently declares that a child should be afforded the dignity and worth of the human person. It speaks of the full and harmonious development of the child that the child has to grow up in an atmosphere of happiness, love and understanding. It further states that the child should be brought up in a spirit of peace, dignity, tolerance, equality and solidarity, said De Livera, explaining the extent to which the said allegation has violated the childs rights. 
De Livera mentioned that the NCPA was informed of the incident via its 24-hour child line, the moment it took place. The matter was referred to the ASP in charge of the NCPA Police Unit who is handling the investigation. Statements from relevant parties were obtained. The JMO is due to submit his report and once it is received the NCPAs Law Enforcement Unit will take action after consulting the Attorney General, she said. 
Occasional incidents of rights violation underscore the necessity of taking steps to ensure that such incidents arent repeated in the future. The impact that these violations have on the victims live is traumatic. Therefore it is of utmost importance to take strict measures to prevent such violations. Especially the various reports of student assaults and child abuse that spring up indicate the lack of awareness on the consequences of law violation.
Sensitisation of school principals and Teachers on Human Rights and Duties, especially on Child Rights and Legal Literacy, is important. The strict enforcement of prevailing laws should be made, De Livera stressed. At the end of the day, it boils down to the fact that the protection of the countrys future generation is the duty of every citizen. All members of the community working together to promote and protect the Rights of the Child is necessary to promote the protection of children in the country, she concluded. 
The preconceived accusation that this child is pregnant is unacceptable,- Professor Harendra De Silva-Paediatrician and former chairman of the NCPA 
It is very surprising to learn the extent of action taken regarding the vomiting of a student following accusations not supported with proof. Many questions have been raised regarding this incident. Dr. Harendra De Silva when contacted said, There are many reasons that a child may vomit. It is very rare that the cause behind a child vomiting is due to pregnancy. I find it very irrational and absurd that such a drastic action to expel a student was taken without even investigating into the issue and confirming it, he commented. 
I believe that whoever is at fault should definitely be punished. Teachers should be suspended regarding this kind of behaviour. These kinds of people shouldnt even be allowed to work as teachers, let alone be principals. These kinds of incidents should not be taken lightly and be brushed under the carpet. Strict measures have to be taken against the perpetrators. Once they are found guilty of such violations, the teachers should not be allowed to continue unless they undergo counselling or engage in a rehabilitation programme, Prof. De Silva opined.

It is a fundamental right of a child to learn with dignity. According to Prof. De Silva, a right to education with dignity should be available even if the child is pregnant. Emotionally running down a child is unacceptable. This accusation may have been made due to a personal grudge against the child, the presence of impartiality due to poverty or a previous wrong impression of the child. Whatever the cause, the preconceived notion that this child is pregnant is unacceptable, he accentuated. 
It is reported that the issue will be inquired into by the Ministry of Education. However Prof. De Silva doesnt agree with this ministry conducting an inquiry. I do not believe that the Ministry of Education should be the authority to conduct an inquiry regarding the incident. Inquiries should be carried out by a legal authority. An internal inquiry will prove useless. I am a doctor. It is like asking one doctor to judge the actions of another doctor. Or an accused being judged by ones own relative. Such a judgement would be biased. This case is similar. Normally these types of incidents are brushed under the carpet. But I believe that the perpetrators have to be punished against child rights violations, he stressed. 
This particular incident, where the child was expelled without proof, is an offence under the grounds of cruelty to children. The student should be allowed to continue with her schooling again in another school, which will provide her with a standard education, he continued. There is no doubt about the trauma that a student faces when allegations of such nature are made. This student is a tenth grader. Such an incident can affect a childs mentality and her studies, especially when she is just about to sit for her Ordinary Level Examination. 
Teachers should be able to deal with students sensitively. The root of this problem was a health issue. Even when the child is innocent, the child gets abused. Teachers should be held accountable for their actions. A teacher should be removed from his or her post and appropriate punishment should follow when the individual is proven guilty. Action should be taken regardless of whether the wrong doer is sent to jail or for rehabilitation, he concluded.

## Title: Trump demands Congress terminate diversity immigration lottery

Trump demands Congress terminate diversity immigration lottery
	
President Donald Trump, during a White House Cabinet meeting Wednesday, said he wants to terminate the Diversity Visa Lottery, a program that distributes around 50,000 visas to countries where there is a low rate of immigration to the US.
"I am, today, starting the process of terminating the diversity lottery program," Trump said, seated next to Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Defense Secretary Jim Mattis. "I am going to ask Congress to immediately initiate work to get rid of this program, diversity lottery, diversity lottery. Sounds nice, it is not nice, it is not good. It hasn't been good and we have been against it."
He added: "We're going to quickly as possible get rid of chain migration and move to a merit-based system."
Trump added that based on preliminary information, the attacker in New York "was the point of contact, the primary point of contact for, and this is preliminarily, 23 people, that came in or potentially came in with him and that is not acceptable."
The comments follow Trump's tweets on Wednesday morning that blamed Sen. Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, for the program.
"The terrorist came into our country through what is called the 'Diversity Visa Lottery Program,' a Chuck Schumer beauty," Trump tweeted. "I want merit based."
Schumer was a key shaper of the 1990 legislation that created the program, but also played a lead part in the 2013 Gang of Eight bill that that passed the Senate on a bipartisan basis and included removing the diversity lottery program. The bill would have moved those visas elsewhere in the system and introduced a merit system that took into account multiple factors like family and work skills.
The diversity visa has been a point of contention for years. The 50,000 visas, distributed by random selection among countries where there is a low rate of immigration to the US, were originally designed to diversify the pool of immigrants to the US. The visas offer immigrants green cards, permanent legal residence and a path to citizenship.
Republican Sens. Tom Cotton and David Perdue have introduced a bill, endorsed by Trump, that would eliminate the diversity lottery and certain categories of family-based green cards, and then would transform the remaining employment-based visas into a point system that favors heavily highly skilled, highly educated, English-speaking immigrants.
But while there is consensus around needing to reform the process, limited support exists even within the GOP for Cotton and Perdue's bill.
Sen. Jeff Flake, an Arizona Republican who has been an ardent critic of Trump, noted in a tweet Wednesday that the Gang of Eight bill, had it been signed into law, would have done away with the diversity visa program.
The Cotton-Perdue bill would roughly halve the number of green cards overall per year, a point of contention for many Democrats and Republicans alike, and wouldn't easily allow for low skilled immigrants to come to the US permanently, another sticking point for many.
Trump also labeled the alleged attacker an "animal" to reporters Wednesday, and said the United States must "get much tougher" with terror suspects.
Trump called for "quick justice" and "strong justice" for terror suspects.
"What we have right now is a joke and it is a laughing stock and no wonder so much of this stuff takes place," Trump said.
The President's initial Twitter response to the attack labeled the attacker a "very sick and deranged person" and offered his "thoughts, condolences and prayers to the victims and families of the New York City terrorist attack."
Trump later tweeted that he was ordering his Department of Homeland Security to "step up our already Extreme Vetting Program."
It was not clear what program the President was referring to. Reached Tuesday night, DHS referred all questions on the "vetting" order to the White House, which did not respond to questions.
Soon after Trump tweeted Wednesday morning, Schumer responded with a tweet of his own: "I guess it's not too soon to politicize a tragedy."
Schumer also accused the President of "politicizing and dividing America" and urged him to focus "on the real solution -- anti-terrorism funding -- which he proposed cutting in his most recent budget."
New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat, said at a Wednesday morning news conference that the President's tweets were "not helpful."
"I don't think they were factual. I think they tend to point fingers and politicize the situation," he said. "You play into the hands of the terrorist to the extent that you disrupt, divide and frighten people in the society. The tone now should be the opposite -- on all levels."
Trump's decision to address immigration policy hours after the terrorist attack is markedly different than the tack the White House took after a shooter in Las Vegas opened fire on a concert last month, killing 58.
White House press secretary Sarah Sanders, asked about gun control policy the day after the shooting in Las Vegas, dismissed the idea of talking about policy so soon after a shooting.
"We haven't had the moment to have a deep dive on the policy part of that," Sanders said.
We've been focused on the fact that we had a severe tragedy in our country. And this is a day of mourning, a time of bringing our country together, and that's been the focus of the administration this morning."
Pressed on why Trump brought up the travel ban hours after shootings in Orlando and San Bernardino, Sanders added at the time, "I think there's a difference between being a candidate and being the President."
Tuesday's terror attack in New York was the city's deadliest since 9/11. Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov drove a rented van down a bike path, law enforcement sources have said. The attack killed six victims instantly, while two others died later. New York politicians and officials quickly labeled the incident a terror attack.
Right-wing blogs and publications began blaming Schumer's immigration policies on Tuesday night and Trump's comments track with much of what was written.
"Blame Democrat Senator Chuck Schumer," read a post from the Gateway Pundit.
Breitbart, the right-wing publication run by Steve Bannon, Trump's former chief strategist, was leading with a story about the Diversity Visa Lottery Program, citing an ABC New York story that reported Saipov came to the United States through the program.
Turning to immigration politics shortly after a terrorist attack has become a pattern for Trump.
After a deadly mass shooting in San Bernardino, California, in 2015, then candidate-Trump called for the "total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country's representatives can figure out what is going on."
Trump ran on hard-line immigration policies in 2016, pledging to build a wall along the US-Mexico border, cut down the number of refugees coming into the United States and deporting undocumented immigrants currently in the United States.
After stepping into the Oval Office in January, Trump proposed a sweeping travel ban that banned immigration from a series of countries. The ban, which has been repeatedly altered and fought in court, currently puts increased screening on nationals from Chad, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Venezuela and Yemen. Immigration from North Korea and Syria is suspended entirely.
Democrats slammed Trump on Wednesday for quickly turning to immigration after the terror attack.
"This has become the pattern for President Trump, dating back to the campaign," Rep. Adam Schiff, D-California, told MSNBC. "No matter where an attack happens around the world, whether it's in the United States, Europe, he immediately goes to questions about immigration." (CNN)

Unitary State if under one sovereign legislative body: Patali
	
If Sri Lanka is to be a unitary state, there should be one sovereign legislative body, Megapolis and Western Development Champika Ranawaka said today.
Addressing a Press briefing at the Jathika Hela Urumaya (JHU) head office Minister Ranawaka said there would be no use of being a unitary state if the legislative powers were granted for several institutions by the Constitution.
Therefore, he said the JHU would not believe the word unitary mentioned in the Constitution but only the definition given for it. He said that the Provincial Council system dented the unitary nature however was not demolish completely.
JHU is against the concept of the country should be secular. Sinhala language and the Theravada Buddhism had a great history in this country. Buddhism had given the foremost place by the clause 9 in the Constitution while it had granted equality for every other religion by the clause 10. In fact none of religious leaders asked to remove the foremost position given to Buddhism, he said.
However, the minister said the Provincial Council system should be further amended and the Tamil peoples issues cannot be resolved even though devolving power to the North. Therefore, he said the JHU requested to strengthen the Pradeshiya Sabhas and the Tamil leaders should give up dreaming of a separate independent homeland and join with the government.
Meanwhile, the minister said that there is no executive presidency in the country, and therefore no use of talking on dictator executive body. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)
