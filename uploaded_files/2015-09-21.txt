Salaries of Lankans in Qatar through bank accounts
	
From November onwards, the salaries of Sri Lankans employed in Qatar will no longer be paid in cash but through bank accounts, the Foreign Employment Ministry announced today.
This has been decided by Qatar Labour and Social Services Minister Abdulla Saliya Al Khulaifi after discussions with Foreign Employment Minister Thalatha Athukorala during her recent visit to the Middle East.
The Qatar minister said the new move would ensure that the employees? salaries were safe and secure. He said there had been several complaints when salaries were paid in cash.
"With this move, we hope to resolve complaints about employers not paying the stipulated salariesto employees or failing to pay their salaries altogether," he said.
Minister Athukorala thanked the Qatar Labour Minister and said the ties between Sri Lanka and Qatar would be strengthened with talks to be held in December between the two countries.
She said action would be taken against those who continue to remain in Qatar despite the expiry of their work visas. ?
The minister said though some 145,000 Sri Lankans were employed in Qatar, only107,000 have registered withour Embassy in Qatar.
During her visit, she also met Sri Lankans who were displaced after having had problems with their employers. The minister assured that arrangements would be made to bring them back to Sri Lanka as soon as possible. (Piyumi Fonseka)

Bridge will make SL another Indian State: Gammanpila
	
Pivithuru Hela Urumaya (PHU) General Secretary and MP Udaya Gammanpila today criticised the move by India to create a bridge connecting Sri Lanka and charged the link would only work in favour of India ultimately making Sri Lanka another State of India.
He said India had requested a loan of USD 5.2 billion from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for the project but not once mentioned that Sri Lanka too have to share when paying the loan.
?This is clear evidence that the project if monopolised by India to solve their issues, to send their people to Sri Lanka. Just like there is a Great Wall to protect China, the Indian Ocean protects our island. If the project went ahead, our sovereignty will be destroyed. President Maithripala Sirisena will end up being a Chief Minister of one of India?s States,? MP Gammanpila told a news briefing.
He said that it was not strange to create bridges or tunnels linking countries as there are already such arrangements between France and England as well as between Sweden and Denmark. However, he said if to be linked, two countries should possess similar characteristics.
?The unemployed population in India is about 50 million while there are 400 million of poverty stricken people. India has a habit of sending their unemployed people overseas. If their people who are willing to work for less salary than ours arrive here, we will face grave repercussions. National security and economy will be threatened,? he said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

CAL?s key insights on IPOs ? how to take your company public
	
		 		 
		 
			
Capital Alliance, Sri Lanka?s leading full service investment bank, has enabled several companies in the country to prepare for and successfully execute their Initial Public Offering (IPO). CAL celebrates 15 years of success in Sri Lanka this year and is currently the country?s market leader in IPOs, raising Rs.10 billion for clients since 2010.?
Providing corporates and investors with an in-depth understanding of how IPOs work and benefit companies, CAL Head of Investment Banking Deshan Pushparajah shares his insights.
Pushparajah is an expert at public and private capital markets, both buy-side and sell-side mergers and acquisitions, and enjoys the trust of an established network of clients in the local and international capital markets. He has been with the CAL group since 2007 and has overseen the Investment Banking unit through a challenging post-conflict period. He has also been instrumental to CAL emerging as a market leader in both equity and debt capital markets. Deshan is a CFA charterholder (USA) and a Fellow Member of both the Chartered Institute of Management Accountants (UK) and the Association of Chartered Certified Accountants (UK).?
Understanding what an IPO is and what it entails: Describing an IPO in greater detail, Deshan Pushparajah stated, ?An Initial Public Offering, or IPO, is the first sale of stock by a company to the public. In Sri Lanka, an IPO is offered to the public through the Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE).?
The investors of an IPO range from local and institutional fund managers to retail investors and corporate clients. The shares continue to trade on the CSE subsequent to the offer. An IPO can take the form of an Offer for Subscription, where the company seeks to raise new funds or an Offer for Sale where an existing shareholder choses to divest part of his holding in the company. Companies can also list on the CSE by way of an Introduction, where no shares are offered to the public but they become tradable subsequent to the same.?High-profile global and local IPOs?
Most of the top 10 global IPOs have all hailed from the Asian region, most recently Alibaba, the diversified e-commerce company went public in 2014 and raised a staggering US $ 25 billion ? and became the largest IPO in history. In 2010, the ABC Bank, otherwise known as the Agricultural Bank of China raised US $ 22 billion and ICBC Bank of China, NTT DoCoMo a Tokyo-based telecommunications player, Visa Inc. and AIA, a Hong Kong-based investment and insurance company, all raised over US $ 17 billion with their IPOs. The Facebook IPO in 2012 raised US $ 16 billion and in 2010 General Motors raised US $ 15 billion with its IPO.?
Locally, CAL has handled the largest IPOs in Sri Lanka including the largest post-war IPO for People?s Leasing Company PLC which raised Rs.7 billion and IPOs for other leading corporates such as Laugfs Gas PLC, Renuka Agri Foods PLC and Vallibel Finance PLC amongst many others.IPO benefits?
An IPO has benefits for both the company as well as its existing shareholders.The company benefits from gaining an alternate, significant source of equity capital and greater visibility. Outlining the other benefits of an IPO, Pushparajah stated, ?Through an IPO, the shareholders of a company benefit from being able to establish a value for the asset they have been instrumental in creating whilst also creating ready liquidity should they wish to monetize part of the same. Listings become a transformative period for most companies and during this time, companies can formalize and lay the foundation for future growth. It also helps family companies deal with succession planning and enables them to attract the best talent to the firm.?Risk of losing company control through an IPO
Many companies are hesitant to issue an IPO because they fear that they might lose control of the company. Commenting on this Pushparajah stated, ?This is a common myth when it comes to listings. For an IPO, you only have to dilute a minimum of 10 percent to the public and at best you can dilute up to 49 percent of the company without losing absolute control of the company. Whilst you will now have other minority shareholders, whose welfare you should always be concerned about, they will always be just that ? the minority.?CAL?s role in an IPO
CAL has been a dynamic force in Sri Lanka?s investment banking and finance arena and has helped many leading corporates to successfully issue IPOs and reach new levels of growth and success.?
Commenting on how CAL gets involved in issuing an IPO Pushparajah stated, ?Our role is to hold your hand throughout the entire IPO journey and ensure that it goes as smoothly as possible for you. Starting with helping you to structure your company, we also help you put the house in order and prepare the management for public life. We then put together the complex legal documentation required by the Stock Exchange and the SEC on your behalf.?
However, the main aspect of our value addition is in helping you place a value on the asset that you have painstakingly created and we thereafter engage with investors to convince them of the future potential of your company. We reach out to investors with varying motivations and those across multiple geographies to ensure that you have a nice mix of partners in your future story.?
We don?t stop there though. Subsequent to an IPO, we continue to work with you to ensure a constant engagement with investors and to ensure that the share price fully reflects the present and future success of your company. This will help you return to shareholders even at a later date in order to raise more funds from them.?How to prepare for an IPO
Outlining what needs to be done to issue an IPO, Pushparajah stated, ?The first step is to make the decision to list your company. It is obviously a life-changing one, so we can engage with you from this early stage to prepare you for its implications. Once you make this decision, we can help you navigate the next-steps. Our forte is in family businesses and we have immense expertise in helping them sift through complex family complications in order to deliver the best outcome and ensure the best value for everybody involved.??

	UNP Parliamentarian Hirunika Premachandra today said she was uncertain as how to address former President Mahinda Rajapaksa since he was also now an ordinary parliamentarian.
	?Mahinda Rajapaksa lost his reputation because of his extreme hunger for power. If he stayed at home without contesting the parliamentary election, we could have still addressed him as the former president. Now I am in a dilemma as how to address him, whether to call him ?Manthri Thuma? (parliamentarian), sir or former president. He is just a parliamentarian like any of us now. Other parliamentarians also call him ?Manthri Thuma,? she said.
	Addressing a meeting in Wellampitiya yesterday, she also said the actions of the new government were very silent in comparison with the previous government and added the political culture in the country was now taking a new leap.
	?We like to have decent ministers with simple political principles. They should be able to travel in their vehicle only with their driver and not with a security squad, unless their lives are under threat,? MP Premachandra said.

Video: JVP allocated Rs.10mn for Wijeweera family: Somawansa
	
	Former JVP Leader Somawansa Amarasinghe today said the party Central Committee had decided four years ago to allocate Rs. 10 million to provide a house for the family of its founder Rohana Wijeweera if they were evicted from the Naval quarters in Welisara.
	Commenting on the recent decision to evict Mr. Wijeweera?s family, he said this was the second occasion where an eviction letter had been issued.
	?The same notice was issued while I was the JVP leader four year ago. The party made a decision back then to allocate Rs. 10 million to provide a new house for the family. The funds should still be there, I hope so. It is good thing if the JVP is willing to take the responsibility of the family. All the JVP is left with today is to implement the party decision. It seems they have enough money to spend for electioneering lately so I believe they have no monetary issues,? he said.
	Upon receiving the eviction letter four years ago, he said Mr. Wijeweera?s family had made a plea to postpone the eviction date, which was obliged.
	While claiming that he didn?t see the new eviction letter yet, Mr. Samarasinghe, now the Secretary of the Peoples Servants Party said the government should take responsibility of providing security to the family members of late Mr. Wijeweera.
	He reminded how Mr. Wijeweera?s family handed themselves over to the government on the assurance of providing security following the arrest and assassination of Mr. Wijeweera.
	?We can provide the family a new home but still we can?t provide the security which is being provided by security forces. I still believe there are threats to Mr. Wijeweera?s family members as JVP members who fought against separatism and foreign invasions had not been meted out with justice yet,? he said.
	Mr. Amarasinghe said he had another solution to solve the issue. ?I will reveal it today (22),? he said. (Lahiru Pothmulla and Indika Sri Aravinda)

Limiting vehicle leasing rate: Temporary measure to reduce new vehicles
	
Transport Deputy Minister Asoka Abeysinghe said the government made it compulsory to pay 30 per cent of the value of a vehicle to the leasing company when purchasing a vehicle on lease and it was just a temporary measure to reduce the number of new vehicles registered and not to create hardship to the purchasers of vehicles.
Addressing a meeting of the Atugalpura Journalists? Association he pointed out that one could take away a vehicle on lease without making an initial payment, but now the purchaser should pay 30 per cent of the value of the vehicle.
?Statistically over 5 million families live in Sri Lanka, but 6 million vehicles have been registered. At present 600,000 motorcars, 3.2 million motorcycles, one million trishaws, 100,000 buses have been registered and this has created severe traffic congestion in the main roads. The government has proposed to reduce the staff of the SLTB through voluntary retirement. The SLTB has not paid ETF contributions since 2010. However, 7,000 new employees have been appointed for the period. At present the SLTB has 36,700 employees for 6,500 buses. The government is planning to streamline the affairs of the SLTB? he said. Public transport services in any country are not profit making enterprises but they are not running at a loss. However, in Sri Lanka public transport services are running at heavy losses? he said.

The suspect who pushed his wife and youngest daughter into the sea, in a confession to the police, said that he had wanted to get rid of his wife so that he could marry a woman who he had not even seen.
He said the woman, who had identified herself as Madushika, was from Kurunegala, but he had not even seen her to date. He explained that he had got her phone number by accident, after he dialed a number incorrectly.
He was arrested by the police on charges of pushing his wife and daughter into the sea at Mahapalana in Kosgoda. The child drowned in the sea while his wife survived the fall. He however explained that he had not intended to kill his daughter and that he was forced to do so because when he asked his wife to hand the child over to him she had refused to let go of her and a result both had fallen off the rock after he pushed his wife over.
He had previously asked his wife to take the younger child to the beach with them so as not to arouse suspicion that he was going to harm her. (Hemantha De Silva)

Ms. Wijeweera hits out at JVP attitude towards them
	
	The late JVP leader Rohana Wijeweera's widow Chitrangani today said she wondered how the JVP was now saying that the party would take care of her family, since the party had failed to look into the well-being of her family for the past 26 years.
The widow and children of the late JVP leader had been asked to vacate the Navy quarters they had been occupying in Welisara on October 1.
Earlier, the party?s general secretary Tilvin Silva said the JVP would continue to provide protection to the family. He said the party had been providing them with their requirements in the past as well and would continue to provide such relief and accommodation in the future.
In an interview with the Lankadeepa newspaper yesterday, Chitrangani said she was condemning statements made by the JVP as all of them were just lies. ?We were at the naval headquarters at Welisara for the past 26 years. The JVP didn?t bother to take us out, although they had the chance to do so. Now they are just making these comments for their own benefits,? she said.
?Hereafter I will not shut my mouth, although they managed to shut my mouth and my children during the past 26 years,? she said.
She also said when she requested to send their family overseas few years ago, Tilvin Silva rejected it. ?I also requested the same from Nihal Galappatti and Somawansa Amarasinghe, but they too rejected it,? she said.
She also accused the JVP of not requesting an investigation into the death of their former leader Wijeweera and other murdered members of the JVP in 1989. ?But now they (JVP) are demanding investigations into the deaths of Tamils in the north,? she accused.
She also said that she tried to contact JVP Leader Anura Kumara almost everyday day since he became the leader of the party. ?But he (Anura) didn?t answer my phone knowing that I was calling,? she said.
She said that leaving the Naval quarters at Welisara was upto them to decide as she was going to discuss the matter with the government. ?But I am telling the JVP not to make any comment about us anymore as we will solve our problems somehow, as we don?t have any trust on the JVP anymore,? she added.
Mr. Wijeweera?s widow and six children handed themselves over to the Army Headquarters following the assassination of Wijeweera in 1989.

	Minister of Finance Ravi Karunanayake today denounced the claim made by a consumer rights group that there is a move to increase the import taxes on paper and the taxes charged from the advertisements in electronic media.
	The Minister said one must not waste time responding to these false statements.
	He made this remarks responding to a query made by the Daily Mirror with regard to a statement made by Consumer Rights Protection National Organisation that there is a move to increase the import taxes on paper and the taxes charged from the advertisements in electronic media.
	Consumer Rights Protection National Organization President Ranjith Vithanage told Daily Mirror that increase in import taxes of paper used for printing may result in increasing of newspaper prices as packaging may cost more for the producers. Accordingly he said the price of weekly news papers will increase further from the current price of Rs 60. This he said will indirectly affect the people?s right to information as the news papers is the most common and easy way for the people to get information.
	Mr. Withanage said there is a move to increase the taxes charged for advertisements in the electronic media, the association urged the government to re-think about this decision. (Yohan Perera)
