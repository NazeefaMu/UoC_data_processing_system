Gammanpila predicts a gloomy future for SL
	
Pivithuru Hela Urumaya (PHU) General Secretary MP Udaya Gammanpila today said Sri Lanka would be faced with a great economic collapse in future, even though the government had announced in the 2017 Budget that there would be a positive turnover in the economy of the country next year.
Addressing a media briefing, MP Gammanpila said three main international companies had predicted that the Sri Lankan economy would be collapsed in the future, according to the sequential investigations made by them.
Fitch sequential has stated that the Sri Lankan economy is decreased to B+ from BB and it would be a risk to the country. The Greeks Fitch ratings are also the same. This means the risk of a breakdown in the country's economy, he added.
MP Gammanpila said the investors of the stock market would wind up Sri Lanka because of the pathetic economic condition prevailing in the country: There would be no direct investors from the international market to invest in Sri Lanka with the current economic collapse in Greece. Will they once again invest their funds in our bonds he added.
He said the Standard and Poor's company has also stated Sri Lanka as a country which had risked the B+ stability and added that the Moodys company has also announced Sri Lanka as an economically risked and negatively impacted country in the near future.

Increased fine to minimize road accidents
	
The minimum fine for traffic offenses is to be increased to Rs.2,500 through the 2017 budget in an effort to arrest the increasing number of road accidents, Deputy Transport and Civil Aviation Minister Ashok Abeysinghe said.
He said this when asked about the strike by the Lanka Private Bus Owners Association (LPBOA), which was later called off.
The deputy minister said that by making such demands the private bus owners were requesting us to allow them to drive the buses in a manner that pleases them.
"The number of road accidents continues to increase and this fine would restrain the drivers from driving the vehicles recklessly and maintain road discipline. This increased fine has been imposed to help save the lives and limbs of the commuters, pedestrians, drivers and conductors. In foreign countries the fine amounts to US$150 to 200. In Australia it is about AUD500. Only in our country that a very low fine has been imposed so far," he said.
"See how three-wheelers are driven. They flout all road rules and often end in accidents. The fine was increased purely to minimize the road accidents and to induce the drivers to be more disciplined, he said. (Shiva Bandara)

Land Bank:Govt. to bring all crown land under one body
	
The government is to bring in new legislation providing for the transfer of all the State lands currently remaining under the purview of different bodies to a common institution named State Land Bank for the disbursement of them for development purposes when and where necessary, it is learnt.
For this purpose, the Cabinet Committee on Economic Management has decided to proceed with the draft bill to establish this Land Bank or a register compiling all details of State lands.
If enacted, the bill will also provide for the establishment of the Lank Bank Commission to decide on the lands to be surveyed and registered.
It is learnt that the Committee took into account the concerns over the ownership of land in the Northern and the Eastern Provinces, and issues related to the forest lands.
According to Cabinet sources, the proposed authority is to be empowered for the disbursement of State lands.
Sources said Megapolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka is reported to have said that the powers to be given under the draft bill were bound to clash with the provisions of the proposed Western Region Development Authority Bill.
Therefore, he had requested those concerned to exclude lands to be taken over by the Urban Development Authority (UDA) for low income housing projects in this exercise.
Accordingly, the government has decided to include a provision in the bill that enables the UDA to apply for lands from the State Land Bank if needed for housing projects.(Kelum Bandara)

Motorcyclists requested to wear black arm-bands to protest minimum penalty
	
The Ceylon Motorcyclists Association yesterday requested all motorcyclists to wear a black arm-band from tomorrow to protest against the minimum penalty of Rs.2,500 for traffic offences as proposed in the 2017 Budget.
While criticizing the budget proposal, the association said that the move will badly effect the low-income earners who are forced to ride motorcycles to their work-places and pointed out that the fine itself is higher than the monthly petrol expenses of some motorcycle riders.
It also said the move to increase fines would encourage motorists to offer bribes to the traffic police and thereby defeat the purpose it was meant for.
Therefore, the association requested the government to re-consider the implementation of the minimum penalty of Rs.2,500 for traffic offences.

Sooka calls for UN probe on torture by SL security forces
	
Former member of the UN special panel Yasmin Sooka has said the UN Committee Against Torture (UNCAT) should visit Sri Lanka and conduct an independent investigation into the continued abductions, torture and sexual violence allegedly committed by the security forces, the Indian Express today reported.
Indian-origin Yasmin Sooka is a member of a former UN special panel on Sri Lankas war with the LTTE. She heads the International Truth and Justice Project (ITJP).
Her call has come ahead of the UNCATs meeting in Geneva this week to examine torture in Sri Lanka.
Torture and abduction are so systematic and entrenched in the DNA of the security forces that even a realignment of political parties in parliament and the new government under President Sirisena are not able to stop these crimes.
It requires political will and a commitment on the part of the Government of Sri Lanka to carry out a comprehensive security sector reform programme which is sadly missing in Sri Lanka, Sooka said in a statement.
She was one of three in the panel appointed by the former UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon to advise him on the alleged war crimes in Sri Lanka during the last phase of the war with the LTTE which ended in 2009.
Her International Truth and Justice Project (ITJP) has collected testimony from 36 Tamil victims in three European countries, who have suffered abduction, illegal detention, torture or sexual violence at the hands of intelligence and security officers under the present Sri Lanka government.
In 10 of these cases the victims have already been granted asylum, meaning their cases have already been found credible by foreign governments, she said.
Overall ITJP has more than two hundred statements from Sri Lankan victims of alleged war crimes and post-war torture and sexual violence who have fled the country. The orgnisation has also begun to identify some alleged perpetrators, Sooka said.
I want the outside world to know that torture is still happening in Sri Lanka and the torture that I suffered, the news article said quoting a young Tamil woman allegedly abducted in a white van and gang raped this year in illegal detention in the North.
The international community, including the UN is under an obligation to ensure that the Government of Sri Lanka honours its commitments made in the Human Rights Council in regard to the transitional justice programme in Sri Lanka.
Overlooking the ongoing violations is not doing either the Government of Sri Lanka a favour or the victims, whose suffering should not be swept under the carpet just because of political expediency, Sooka added. (The Indian Express)

TN started training LTTE in 1983
	
Soon after the July 1983 anti-Tamil riots in Sri Lanka and the influx of Tamil refugees into Tamil Nadu, the training of Tamil militants began in Tamil Nadu with the knowledge and patronage of the Tamil Nadu government. Indias national intelligence agencies started their training program only in 1984, when New Delhi felt that Tamil Nadus initiative in the matter might not be in the overall Indian interest, says Air Marshal (Rtd) Bharat Kumar in his book Operation Pawan: Role of Airpower with IPKF. 
The training of Tamil rebels had commenced in Tamil Nadu with full knowledge and in some cases, under the patronage of the state government. New Delhis suggestion to rein in these Tamil groups were not acceptable to Tamil Nadu leaders. Since the Central government could not afford Tamil Nadu invading Sri Lanka, various Indian intelligence agencies also got into the act from 1984 onward. It was better that the Indian state got involved in Sri Lanka rather than the Tamil Nadu government because of obvious repercussions, Bharat Kumar says.
Unlike Tamil Nadu leaders M.G.Ramachandran and M.Karunanidhi, Indian Prime Ministers Indira Gandhi and Rajiv Gandhi were not for an independent Tamil state in Sri Lanka. They saw the arming of the Tamil militants as an instrument to pressurize the Sri Lankan government to find a permanent solution to the Sri Lankan Tamil problem.
This is why, even as the training of Sri Lankan Tamil militants was going on India in 1984, Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi sent, in December that year, an undisclosed number of Indian warships to patrol the Palk Strait.
Quoting Edgar OBallance, The Cyanide war: Tamil Insurrection in Sri Lanka 1977-88, Bharat Kumar says: He (Rajiv Gandhi) also decided to reduce the flow of arms from Tamil Nadu to Tamil insurgents in Sri Lanka. And on 29 March 1985, the Indian Coast Guard began selectively stopping and searching craft suspected of ferrying weapons across the Palk Strait.
However, despite these steps, by early 1987, there were fears of the LTTE becoming too strong. India launched Operation Tiger in November 1986 to disarm LTTE cadres in India and to take over their communication equipment .This action took place just before the SAARC summit in Bangalore. But to generate goodwill before the summit, where Rajiv Gandhi wanted LTTE chief Prabhakaran and Sri Lankan President J.R.Jayewardene (JR) to meet and thrash out issues, the seized equipment were released.
When the JR-Prabhakaran talks broke down with JR saying a firm no to the merger of the Northern and Eastern Provinces to form a single Tamil-speaking province, and Prabhakaran sticking firmly to his demand for an independent Eelam, Rajiv Gandhi developed an aversion for Prabhakarans intransigence, and became more favorably inclined to Jayewardenes views.
By 1986, the LTTE had established its dominance in the Northern peninsula, subjugating the rival Tamil militant groups and at the same time defending the peninsula against the Sri Lankan forces. The situation worsened in January 1987 when the Tigers announced a plan to establish a separate administration in Jaffna and the Sri Lankan government immediately imposed an embargo on food and fuel supplies to the North creating near famine conditions.(Indian Express)
