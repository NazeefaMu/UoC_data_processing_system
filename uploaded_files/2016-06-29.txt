AIA declares outstanding 9.55% dividend for customers
	
Against the economic scenario last year, which showed the country?s gross domestic product (GDP) growth slowing down while inflation increased, AIA Sri Lanka was able to declare an outstanding dividend of 9.55 percent for its policyholders. This showcased the strength and the superlative investment strategy of AIA?s life fund, which now stands at Rs.30 billion.?
Since AIA introduced the system of declaring an annual dividend, the amount declared every year has always been well above the guaranteed amount promised by the company to its policyholders. The dividend is a significant value addition to the insurer?s customers who are already enjoying protection benefits.?
How exactly does AIA?s dividend system work and how does it affect AIA?s customers? ?AIA Sri Lanka Chief Actuary Frank Munro said, ?We are indeed proud to say that this is an excellent proposition we offer our customers, especially during the past three years when our dividend has been consistently higher than the average bank interest rates. Also our policyholders benefit significantly because their premium investments grow with compound interest and not just on a simple interest basis.??
He further explained, ?The premiums all policyholders pay are collected into a single ?pot? ? in other words known as the life fund, which is prudently managed by the company. ?The dividend is a percentage of the investment earned from the life fund and is credited to each policyholder?s individual account after deducting fund management charges. This is a simple, fool-proof and transparent benefit for all AIA customers.? ?
AIA Sri Lanka Deputy Chief Executive Officer and Chief Agency Director Upul Wijesinghe said, ?Our unique dividend system simply translates into a bigger lump-sum for each individual policyholder. It is better than the bonus declared by many other insurers because bonuses are calculated on the life fund profits for the period while our dividends are based on the investment income and are not reduced by operating costs.?
More importantly, bonuses are not guaranteed to be paid while AIA declares a guaranteed dividend rate at the beginning of each year and the dividend amount that is declared at the end of the year is credited to the policyholders? accounts.?

Allure of politics wears thin for her!
	
?
A dainty fair Diyawanna member has grown sick of politics, they say. This fair one who has gone out of the public eye for some time is said to be also unhappy over certain rumours that have gone viral.?
?
She has also publicly charged that a rival politico, whom she describes as the prime author of all her troubles has long been scheming to banish her from the political scene.
A very unpleasant situation she had to face when she was going round the flood-hit parts of her constituency in the recent past added to her woes. Some flood victims blamed her for forgetting them in their worst hour; some others shut their doors on her face, they say.
Disillusioned, the comely lady has vowed not to contest an election again, they say.?

Brexit negatively affect SL economy: Harsha
	
The British exit from the European Union would negatively affect Sri Lankan economy as fluctuation in the share markets in Europe and Asia had begun to occur in the wake of the Brexit, Deputy Foreign Affairs Minister Dr. Harsha de Silva said yesterday.
Dr. De Silva said the instability of the British economy and devaluation of the sterling pound would negatively affect our exports as 35 per cent of the Sri Lankan export to Europe was going to Britain.
?Our exports to Europe is 30 per cent and 35 to 40 per cent of it is going to Britain. Even if we obtain GSP+, we would not be able to gain the full advantage of it as we would not b able to export to Britain without export duty,? he said.
Dr. De Silva said the Sri Lankan Ambassador to Britain yesterday handed over the documents necessary to gain GSP+ in Brussels and the decision regarding it could be expected within six months and added that Rs. 25 billion loss had been incurred due to the non-availability of the GSP+ during the past years.
He said the instability of the British economy would also affect tourism industry in Sri Lanka as 25 per cent of the tourist arrivals from Europe were from Britain.
?The British tourists are the ones who spend most in Sri Lanka and the collapse of the Pound will result in their purchasing power,? he said.
He said the Brexit would also negatively affect the cost of servicing the foreign loans that had been obtained by Sri Lanka as the US$ would increase in the world market and added that the loan interest in the world market would increase, which would affect negatively in obtaining commercial loans.
Dr. De Silva said due to the instability in the British economy, Britain would have to reach in trade agreements with most countries and that Sri Lanka would also have to fast track trade agreement with India, China and other countries in such a situation.
When asked about the campaign by some Sri Lankan politicians against the Brexit, he said they had discussions only with Sri Lankans living there and that it was informal and added that it was not in support of British Prime Minister David Cameron. (Ajith Siriwardana)

ComBank launches Sri Lanka?s first Remittance Card

Sri Lanka?s first Remittance Card has been launched by Commercial Bank of Ceylon to introduce a new dimension in convenience to the process of transferring funds from overseas to local beneficiaries.
A branded debit cum ATM card licensed by Visa Inc. and issued locally by Commercial Bank to recipients of remittances, the new Remittance Card eliminates the need to visit a branch of the bank to collect remitted funds.
Instead, it permits an overseas sender to deposit funds directly into a beneficiary?s account via Commercial Bank?s e Exchange platform. The funds may be withdrawn from any ATM across Sri Lanka at the recipient?s convenience.
The Remittance Card also enables the recipient of the funds to retain all or a portion of the funds in his or her account and use the card to make purchases.
Adding significant value to the card, Commercial Bank said it offers Remittance Card holders an emergency loan facility in times of need. Remittance cardholders will also have additional chances of winning prizes at the consumer promotions conducted by the bank and will be eligible for special loyalty programmes that will reward them based on the amount of money received to their accounts, the bank said.?
?This is a simple and extremely logical solution with several benefits,? Commercial Bank Chief Operating Officer S. Renganathan said. ?It is a secure option for receiving cash and promotes the savings habit while ensuring that the funds are easily accessible 24/7. Additionally, the card may be used for direct purchases at over 15,000 merchant establishments across the country and the holders will enjoy the benefits and discounts offered to debit card holders.?
He also stated that for the first time in the country, remittance recipients have been formally recognised by a bank and been given preferential status. ?The Remittance Card offers them long-term solutions to better manage money received from abroad, thus uplifting their lives while they enjoy many benefits from the bank,? he said.
The first Commercial Bank Visa Remittance card was presented to Sri Lankan Ambassador to Kuwait Kandeepan Bala at a recent event hosted by the bank in the State. It was formally launched in Sri Lanka on June 16, designated International Day of Family Remittances.
The chief guest at this event was Foreign Employment Bureau Deputy General Manager Training Mangala Randeniya, who addressed the remittance recipients in the audience and explained the importance of managing the money received from overseas for better returns.
Commercial Bank is one of the most active players in Sri Lanka in the field of remittances, offering customers a range of options including ?e-Exchange? ? the bank?s own sophisticated real-time on-line money transfer service, as well as the MoneyGram, Ria and Express Money remittance services.

The Parliamentary Committee on Public Enterprises (COPE) is divided on the controversial bond issue, informed sources said yesterday.
"Some members hold a moderate view on the subject, others support the Central Bank Governor and yet others oppose him,? the sources said.
The sources said this would create a crisis within the committee.
The Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) is of the opinion that taking action against the Central Bank Governor is not within the scope of COPE, and that the purpose of COPE is to monitor and look into public enterprises.
JVP leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake expressed this view on behalf of his party and said they should not pass the buck to COPE as it was the duty of the President and the Prime Minister to take action regarding the Central Bank Governor. (Yohan Perera)

Final mechanism will benefit all stakeholders: Mangala tells UNHRC
	
Foreign Minister Mangala Samaraweera, speaking today at the 32nd Session of the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva, said that the mechanism that was finally set up to look into alleged war crimes would be one which had the confidence of all the stakeholders, especially the victims, with fair trial and due process guarantees.
?While dealing with the low-hanging fruit immediately, we have strategies and plans to deal with the more serious and controversial issue of setting up a judicial mechanism with international assistance. Sri Lanka is no stranger to international assistance and participation with many investigative and forensic experts having worked with us in the past,? he said and added ?there are varying views on the nature, level and role of international participation. Divergent views are indicative of a healthy democracy and consultative process. Despite such divergent views, however, I can assure you that the mechanism that is finally set up will be one which has the confidence of the stakeholders, especially the victims, with fair trial and due process guarantees?
He said the Government was united and firm in its commitment to achieve reconciliation, development and ensure non-recurrence while some were waiting for us to fail in our journey of reconciliation.
?There are some who doubt our sincerity to achieve reconciliation, and also a few who want us to fail. For those of our friends who are genuinely concerned, and want Sri Lanka to succeed, every delayed second seems to appear as an eternity, and they fear that the Government has lost its way and the political will to succeed. Then there are others who are misinformed and misled and therefore are unbelievers or are unaware of the achievements so far. And of course there are those who pray that we won?t succeed,? he said in his statement.
The Government recognises that, in order for the transitional justice process to achieve the desired objectives, the necessary mechanisms should be properly sequenced, integrated and coordinated.
Minister Samaraweera rejected claims by some quarters that sequencing of mechanisms was a delaying tactic or means to omit the component of justice.
?Some had started raising alarm bells that sequencing of mechanisms was a delaying tactic or a means to omit the component of justice. This is incorrect. The Secretariat for Coordinating Reconciliation Mechanisms is already consulting experts and is working on obtaining the required training and capacity-building for the relevant mechanisms ? investigating techniques, forensic expertise, prosecutorial strategies ? so that when the designs are in place, following the consultation process, the required expertise for the mechanisms will also be in place,? he said.
He also said while consolidating many of the democratic changes achieved within the first 100 days, the government had begun taking action on all fronts, related to strengthening good governance and the rule of law; promoting and protecting human rights; fostering reconciliation; and achieving economic development; while also engaging and working closely with the international community in a constructive manner that benefits the people of Sri Lanka.

He grudged warm reception accorded to former leader
	
?
The former strongman received a rousing welcome from the compatriot community during his recent visit to the Nippon land.?
?
A certain high-up here had been highly chagrined over the warm reception accorded to the leader now out of power. He is an individual who had found a niche in yahapalanaya as an advisor on political affairs.
This high-up had on his own sent an ?official communication? to the Nippon authorities saying that the Sri Lankan visitor being ?only an ordinary MP now, the state- sponsored privileges be scaled down to his present status.?
On being told about the ?official communication? by an authoritative source and the former strongman had shrugged it off saying: ?Ah! There?s nothing to worry about it.??
The visit over, the former strongman and the five Diyawanna members who accompanied him had called at the Nippon main airport to take a flight back home.
?Later the former strongman had along with others joined a long queue of passengers to take their turn to board the plane. However, the Nippon authorities and the airline officials having spotted the former strongman standing in the queue had greeted him with respect due to a VVIP and escorted him and his entourage to the plane meant for their homeward journey.

They say that this purohita hailing from the country?s backwoods now armed much political clout knows that he can aim high and should no longer bother about minor projects. And he has his eye on a series of mega projects in the pipeline which are to be funded by massive loans pledged by leading international banks.
The purohita was reasonably well off even during the previous regime despite his political ties to a rival party. In fact, a defence authority of the previous regime had awarded a number of road construction and pavement tiling contracts to him. This purohita?s manipulations in the construction industry have placed at least three major firms in great difficulties, they say.?

Leader of the Janasetha Peramuna, Battaramulle Seelarathana Thero lodged a complaint at the Police Financial Crimes Investigation Division (FCID) against the Central Bank Governor Arjuna Mahendran citing non declaration of assets.
Seelarathana Thero met the Deputy Inspector General (IGP) in charge of the FCID Ravi Waidyalankara and had reportedly produced documents supporting his complaint against the Governor.
The DIG had however declined to receive the complaint and had instead directed the Thero to the Inspector General of Police.
When questioned DIG Waidyalankara said that it was not his authority to determine whether it was a complaint to be investigated under the FCID and it was IGP Pujith Jayasundara who would decide which law enforcement agency is most suitable to probe it.
However, the DIG said that it is much likely to be probed under the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption as it is a complaint regarding non declaration of assets. (Kurulu Koojana Kariyakarawana)

Mercantile Investments and Finance PLC?s (MI) recently published annual report and financial results showed the company?s continued business solidity in terms of recording commendable core business growth, whilst posting robust profitability levels for the concluded financial year 2015/16.
MI?s pre-tax profit and post-tax profits stood robustly at Rs.803 million and Rs.505 million, respectively, though dropping by 12 percent and 20 percent, respectively from last financial year. The rising interest rates and the resultant repricing effect continued to impact the LFC sector including MI, in terms of increasing funding cost and exerting pressure on core margins enjoyed. MI to a great degree was able to maintain acceptable core margins by optimizing its attractive diverse lending product mix, moreover focusing its strategy on building its core business of lending.
Despite the vehicle sales market witnessing somewhat challenging conditions mainly due to the high import duty structure, Ml?s lease finance business picked up creditably by 83 percent year-on year.
Managing Director Gerard Ondaatjie said in the midst of a 20 percent total asset expansion, importantly the company managed to safeguard its asset quality, reflective from the decline in Ml?s non-performing lending ratio, which stood at 3.39 percent compared to 4.19 percent recorded previous financial year end. Deposit mobilisation too remained steady with the deposit base growing by 15 percent year-on-year despite the stiff competition among the financial services sector in mobilising savings of people.
Having been in finance business for over 50 years, Ml?s financial strength and stability remained solid, reflective from its strong capital base, which exceeded Rs.7.5 billion. Accordingly, Ml?s core capital adequacy ratio and total risk weighted capital adequacy ratio stood well above the prudential requirements of 5 percent and 10 percent at 19.35 percent and 15.75 percent, respectively.
Mercantile Investments and Finance PLC is a licensed finance company under the Finance Business Act No. 42 of2011, listed on the Diri Savi Board of the Colombo Stock Exchange.

However, Mr. Ratnayake had not requested a transfer.
It is reported that those who worked at Yala National Park with Mr. Ratnayalke are opposed to the ministry's decision to transfer him. (Piyumi Fonseka)

Pan Asia Bank reaches 200,000 Facebook fans
	
Pan Asia Bank recently crossed the 200,000 fan base on the popular social media network, Facebook.
This places Pan Asia Bank among the few domestic banks which have over a 200,000 fan base and is a clear indication of the bank?s intention to leverage social media to bring the banking and financial solutions much closer to today?s digitally-connected customer.
The bank?s ability to reach this milestone within a very short span of time is also a testament to the effective manner in which the bank engaged and interacted with its social media enthusiasts. One of the main reasons for the rapidly increasing popularity of the bank?s Facebook page is the lively and engaging manner in which it interacts with the public.
As the fastest growing commercial banks in Sri Lanka, Pan Asia Bank places great emphasis on realizing the true potential of the social media as a powerful tool that helps to connect with customers. As such, it is committed to maintain presence in all the other popular social media platforms in the Sri Lankan context such as Linkedin, Twitter and Youtube.?
Having well recognized the characteristics of the audience that each social media platform is patronized by, the bank engages them for specific purposes. For example, Linkedin ? the world?s largest professional network ? is used to announce new and upcoming vacancies in the bank and Youtube, the popular video depository and streaming platform, is used to give the public access to company-related videos such as TV commercials.
Most importantly, the bank has made the arrangements to set up the operational platform to receive queries, complains and feedback from the public via these social media platforms and answer them instantly. This has allowed the bank to stay closer to the customers understanding their requirements effectively and offer superior service.?
??As one of the fastest growing banks in Sri Lanka, digital marketing is a vital part of our marketing activities; we use social media as a platform to engage and add value and we are grateful to our fans for their continued support. We are extremely humbled and proud that 200,000 people have chosen to be part of our social media endeavours and help in creating a robust and thriving banking community with true engagement as opposed to simply becoming fans,? said Pan Asia Bank Deputy General Manager Marketing and Card Products Nalaka Wijayawardana.?

Colombo Additional Magistrate Chandana Kalansooriya said today that in the absence of sufficient evidence, Megapolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka could not be named as a suspect in the Rajagiriya accident involving the minister?s vehicle.
Considering the contradictory statements made by witnesses and the police investigations, the Magistrate said there was no way the minister could be named a suspect.(Shehan Chamika Silva)

Private/ public partnership for training youth for jobs: PM
	
A task force is to be appointed to look into developing public/ private partnerships to train youth to become successful players in the job market, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said yesterday.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe who was speaking at the Convocation of the Benedict the XVI Catholic Institute of Higher Education said a task force headed by corporate sector personality Ken Balendran had been appointed to look into the building of public/ private partnerships for job market training.
Further, he said the government is looking towards getting in an agreement with the private degree awarding institutes to produce science, mathematics graduates.
?Science and Mathematics for the GCE Advanced Level examination are taught in limited number of schools. The intention of this government is to expand this. To fulfil this purpose, we have decided to recruit 2,000 graduate teachers. Unfortunately, we cannot find enough graduates in the public university system. Therefore, we have decided to recruit Advanced Level qualified persons to fill the vacancies for science and mathematics teachers. But these Advanced Level qualified youth will be allowed to complete their degrees while teaching,? the Prime Minister said.
He said degree awarding institutes can help by allowing the selected youth for teaching jobs to complete their degrees in their institutes. ?These youth could have a different degree courses to suit their needs,? the Prime Minister said.
He said the government is also faced with finding IT trainers and to find suitable people to teach English.
Further, he said youth should be allowed move higher in the society and to fulfil their dreams. (Yohan Perera)

?T-shirt? envoy gets a dressing-down
	
?
Sri Lankan envoy serving in a predominantly Muslim country located close to Europe came back here recently accompanying the Foreign Minister of the host country.
?
As preplanned the visiting Foreign Minister held official talks with both the Head and the Second in Command of yahapalanaya and at these talks visiting dignitary discussed the nature of development aid his country could extend to ours.?
Incidentally, this envoy hailing from a remote village in the Eastern province had previously served in the same capacity in several other countries as well and had later been confined to the ?pool?.?
The envoy sought an appointment to meet the Big Boss before returning to his post and he was readily granted an audience with the latter one evening.
And the envoy appeared before the new Big Boss at the appointed time dressed in a T-shirt. The Big Boss who naturally felt both affronted and awkward to find the envoy making an official call dressed in casuals later asked the Second-in-Command of Yahapalanaya to give this worthy a good lesson on savoir faire ? dress code in particular.?
The Second-in-Command later sent for the ?T-shirt envoy? and gave him a dressing-down for his callous disregard for professional etiquette, they say.

Thewarapperuma threatens to leave Govt.
	
Deputy Minister of Internal Affairs Palitha Thewarapperuma said today that he would quit the Yahapalanaya Government, if the demands of Meegahathenna Primary School parents were not met.
The Deputy Minister and several parents of the students of the primary school had commenced a hunger strike since Monday (27) outside the Matugama Zonal Education Office, claiming that the authorities had failed to respond to their demands.
Mr. Thewarapperuma said that several parents had gone to the President?s Secretariat to discuss the matter.
?If there is Yahapalanaya, there wouldn?t be such a problem. If the President fails to fulfill the demands, I would leave the Yahapalanaya Government,? he said.

They discover why he remained unperturbed
	
The piece of news that the cockerels led by the King Rooster are set to join the yahapalanaya ranks has ruffled a few feathers in the hill country.
?
There were six members returned to Diyawanna from several political parties, which fought a bitter battle with the cockerel party at the last general poll. These members are highly agitated over the prospect of having to cohabit with the cockerels in case they join the yahapalanya.?
So the leader of the anti-cockerel group the other day called on the Big Boss at his Fort office to lodge a formal protest against taking on board ? their archrivals.
?Sir, we were there in full strength to support you at your hour of need. Why do you want to take on board our rivals who turned against you??
When the Big Boss remained silent without committing himself, the anti-cockerel group leader had played his last trump: ?If they come, Sir, we will go. This also means when you gain two, you will lose six!?
However, the Big Boss had not seemed to have taken this warning seriously either.
Meanwhile, what transpired during the talks between the Big Boss and the Anti-cockerel group leader became the subject of a discussion among several Betel leaf purohitas at the main office in Fort. One purohita said to be farther-sighted than others had analyzed the outcome of the talks thus: ?The six members who threaten to quit are not our members or allies. They are members of the Green party virtually running this government.?
One of the purohitas who listened to this analysis said: ?That explains our Lokka?s nonchalance about the howls of protest being raised by the hill country man.? ?

UNHRC Chief renews calls for int?l participation
	
The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra?ad Al Hussein said today that he was convinced that international participation in the accountability mechanisms would be a necessary guarantee for the independence and impartiality of the investigation process in the eyes of victims, as Sri Lanka?s judicial institutions currently lack the credibility needed to gain their trust.
Presenting an oral update on Sri Lanka to the UN Human Rights Council (UNHRC) during the 32nd session of the UNHRC in Geneva, he said it was also important to keep in mind the magnitude and complexity of the international crimes alleged to have been committed, which the OHCHR investigation found could amount to war crimes and crimes against humanity.
?A key question remains the participation of international judges, prosecutors, investigators and lawyers in the judicial mechanism. In late May 2016, while addressing a large group of senior military officers, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe was reported to have again ruled out international participation in a domestic mechanism. The High Commissioner said he was convinced that international participation in the accountability mechanisms would be a necessary guarantee for the independence and impartiality of the process in the eyes of victims, as Sri Lanka?s judicial institutions currently lack the credibility needed to gain their trust,? he said.
The High Commissioner welcomed the Government of Sri Lanka?s (GOSL) very positive and productive engagement with the United Nations human rights mechanisms, including the standing invitation issued by Sri Lanka to all Special Procedures in December 2015.
He said the full promise of governance reform, transitional justice and economic revival had yet to be delivered and risks stalling or dissipating despite the promise of the National Unity Government to create a political environment conducive to reforms and added that negotiating party politics and power sharing within the coalition had proved complex as the Government seeks to build and retain the two-thirds majority in parliament necessary to reform the Constitution.
He said significant momentum had been achieved in the process of constitutional reform and that the constitutional reform process presented an important opportunity to rectify structural deficiencies that contributed to human rights violations and abuses in the past and reinforce guarantees of non-recurrence.
The High Commissioner also said the Government had also continued to take some important symbolic steps towards promoting reconciliation including the de-listing of a number of Tamil diaspora organisations and individuals who had been proscribed under the Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA), singing the national anthem in both Sinhala and Tamil on Independence Day and replacing the previously hubristic military celebrations of the 2009 victory by a more understated Remembrance Day.
He criticized the fact that the Government had also not moved fast enough with other tangible measures that would help to build confidence among victims and minority communities.
The High Commissioner strongly urged the Government to review and amend the Assistance to and Protection of Victims of Crime and Witnesses Act of 2015 in order to incorporate better safeguards for the independence and effectiveness of the victim and witness protection programme in line with international standards.
