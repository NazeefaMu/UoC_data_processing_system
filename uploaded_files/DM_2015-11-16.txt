Fallen object could be debris of WT1190F
	
	Local and foreign scientists and astronomers believe that the little object that has fallen into a paddy field in Aranayake could be debris of WT1190F which was expected to create a sensation on November 13.
	Dr. G. D. K. Mahanama who was among the local scientists who were assisting the astronomers of European Space Agency (ESA) , International Space Agency (IAC) and United Arab Emirates Space Agency that visited Sri Lanka for the space show which the WT1190F was expected to make said there was a possibility of little left over pieces falling on to the land.  We dont know exactly what the farmer in Aranayake had seen but it could be a little left over piece as there was a possibility of such little pieces falling on land, he said.
	It was reported that a farmer in Aranayake had seen a something like a fire ball coming down and falling into a lake nearby. He had later informed the Aranayake Police.
	Meanwhile, a team of astronomers had captured spectacular images of the object from a high-flying plane over the Indian Ocean very close to the predicted time of arrival. The astronomers who were monitoring the movement of the object from the aircraft Gulfstream 450 had seen the object breaking into two and exploding according to Dr. Mahanama.
	In an airplane window high above the clouds, the crew, which included Peter Jenniskens, Mike Koop and Jim Albers of the SETI Institute along with German, UK and United Arab Emirates astronomers, took video images of the phenomenon.(Yohan Perera)

Govt. planning to handover EPF-ETF to private agency: Bandula
	
The real intention in setting up a private sector pension scheme by merging the EPF and the ETF is to invest these funds in the Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) by handing over their administration to a private fund managing agency, UPFA MP Bandula Gunawardane said today.
He said it was unwise to invest the EPF-ETF funds amounting to Rs.1.7 trillion, the largest fund in South Asia, in the stock exchange because it would put the future of private sector employees at risk.
Investing in the SE is similar to gambling. You never know what will be the outcome. Sometimes you may receive benefits and sometimes you will lose everything. Therefore, it is not acceptable to risk the EPF-ETF fund, Mr. Gunawardane said.
He said the then Finance Minister T.B. Illangaratne who created the EPF appointed the Central Bank as its caretaker. He said the fund which had a balance of Rs.405 billion when the government of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa took over had grown up to Rs.1,442 billion by the time his government took office.
Because of wise investment of the fund, it had increased by 25 per cent annually. Though the government could invest up to 10 per cent in the SE, the previous government had only invested about six per cent. The profits earned last year was Rs.152 billion. And the rest was invested in Treasury Bonds and Bills, Mr. Gunawardene said.
He said if the administration of the fund was handed over to a fund managing agency, it would take the final decision on releasing the funds inclusive of how much the government could use for Treasury Bills.
He said the SLFP should not agree to this move because it was one of SLFP Ministers who created the fund. We request President Maithripala Sirisena, the SLFP Chairman, not to allow this to happen, Mr. Gunawaradne said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

Govt. to sign CEPA in May: Gammanpila
	
Despite protests, the government will be signing the long awaited trade agreement with India entitled the Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA) in May, 2016, Opposition MP and Pivithuru Hela Urumaya General Secretary Udaya Gammanpila alleged today.
He said Minister for Development Strategies and International Trade, Malik Samarawickrama had said the CEPA would be finalised next May while addressing a Young Entrepreneurs Conference held at Waters Edge Hotel recently.
Commenting on the agreement, MP Gammanpila said it will be beneficial only for Indians who would be entering into Sri Lankan trade. Indian businessmen will get an opportunity to buy our markets, he said.
It is clear that everything has been arranged to finalise the CEPA though the government previously rejected reports that they would not be signing the agreement with India. We urge the President not to make Sri Lanka another Fiji where Indians had made up a majority in population. If the CEPA is signed, Sri Lanka will definitely become an Indian colony. We request the Yahapalana government not to let it happen, Mr. Gammanpila said. (Piyumi Fonseka)

PTA to be replaced with fresh legislation
	
	The government is planning to replace the Prevention of Terrorism Act with fresh legislation modelled on the Patriot Act of the United States, it is learnt.
	The PTA was used as a legal tool to deal with LTTE terrorism at that time. However, there were criticisms by some sections over the retaining of the Act even after the war was over. Critics have dubbed it a draconian piece of legislation that undermines individual freedom in the post war context.
	The United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC), in its resolution adopted on Sri Lanka, also calls for the repeal of this law.
	Accordingly, the government is reportedly working out a new legislation to be replaced with the PTA. The Foreign Affairs Ministry, the Justice Ministry and the Legal Draftsmans Department are working in this direction at the moment. A government minister who wished to remain anonymous confirmed this, and said the proposed law would be drafted in line with the Patriot Act of the US.
	The legislation, if enacted, will be consistent with international standards for countering terrorism in any eventuality. The PTA was enacted in 1979 as a temporary measure for three years. Later, in 1982, it was made a permanent.
	It provided for the detention of persons without charge. It was used widely to deal with LTTE suspects. Alongside, the government has now come under pressure for the release of LTTE suspects held without charges in remand custody. Recently, 31 such suspects were released. (Kelum Bandara)

Reports on missing persons submitted to UN group
	
The Dead and Missing Persons Parents Front (DMPPF) yesterday handed over a report to the visiting members of the United Nations Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances (WGEID) at the UN Compound in Colombo.
Ananda Jayamanne, the Chairman of the Front said the report which consisted details on more than 5,000 missing persons, was handed over to a special representative of the WGEID.
WGEID representative accepted our detailed files on the missing persons. There are details that both the Army and the LTTE were responsible for some of the incidents of disappearances. The representative was quite surprised to see the amount of our detailed files and he assured that he would get back to us with the procedures of their future activities into our report, he said.
Earlier, a group of DMPPF members on Saturday visited the UN compound to hand over the report but only Mr. Jayamanne was allowed to submit the report and no representative had been present to accept the report at that time.
The WGEID headed by its Vice President, Bernard Duhaime, arrived in the island last Monday (9) for a 10-day-visit to facilitate investigations into issues related to disappearances.
The mandate of the WGEID is to create a platform between the families of missing persons and the government to address and resolve the issues faced by them and to observe measures taken by governments to prevent future incidents of disappearances.
The WGEID will conclude its activities in Sri Lanka tomorrow (18) and will hold a news conference tomorrow at the UN compound. (Lahiru Pothmulla)
