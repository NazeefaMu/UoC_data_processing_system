Video: BJP will be crucial political force by 2025: BBS
	
	The Bodu Jana Peramuna (BJP), the political wing of the Bodu Bala Sena (BBS) would be a crucial political force in the country by 2025, BBS General Secretary Ven. Galagodaatte Gnanasara Thera said today.
	The thera said that their decision to contest the upcoming general elections as the BJP was intended to spread their ideology among the people and not to make personal gains.?There is political instability in the country at present. Political parties are in shambles and as such we will not join mainstream politics. Current politicians only want what?s best for themselves and their political parties but we will put the country first,? he told a news conference.
	He said the BJP would create a National Political Agenda and that the party?s office bearers and manifesto would be made public in a week.
	Commenting on the upcoming general elections, the thera said they would contest from 15 districts and said they were considering the requests by the people to field at least one monk from a district.
	He said their objective and the ideology would focus on safeguarding Buddhism, the Sinhalese community and the country from the threats they were facing.?We are not attempting to create divisions among communities. The word ?Bodu? in the party name means intelligence. Therefore, as long as the person is intelligent, we will welcome people from all religious and ethnic backgrounds,? he said.
	The Thera said the party symbol ?Cobra? means ?Great? in Pali language and it reflects the protector of water reservoirs. ?Cobra is harmless and it would expand its hood only when someone threatens them in their territory,? he said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

Indonesian military plane with 113 aboard crashes into city
	
	An Indonesian military aircraft with 113 people aboard crashed into a neighborhood in the city of Medan on Tuesday, according to the head of the country?s air force. Forty-nine people were confirmed to have been killed, but the toll appeared certain to rise.
	Air Chief Marshal Agus Supriatna said in a televised interview that there were no signs of survivors from the crash of the C-130 Hercules. He said that 101 of the people on the plane were family members of military personnel. Twelve military personnel were also aboard, he said.
	It was unclear whether people on the ground in Medan, a city of two million on the island of Sumatra, had been killed. Images carried on local television and posted online showed onlookers gathered around burning buildings at the scene of the crash, with several ambulances and fire trucks trying to make their way through the crowd.
	Air Chief Marshal Agus said the crash occurred shortly after the plane took off from the Soewondo air base in Medan. The pilot had asked for permission to return to base, he said.
	The plane was making a routine flight, with multiple stops scheduled. ?It?s normal for family to be transported on these flights,? said Gerry Soejatman, an Indonesian aviation analyst.
	The Indonesian Air Force has had five other plane crashes over the past 10 years, with 155 people killed, according to the Aviation Safety Network website. The deadliest was the 2009 crash of a C-130 near the city of Madiun in East Java that killed 97 passengers and crew members and two people on the ground. That plane hit several houses on its approach to the runway.
	Indonesia has a troubled history of air safety, including several crashes in and around Medan. In 2005, a Boeing 737-200 operated by Mandala Airlines, a low-cost carrier, overran a runway during a failed takeoff there, killing 100 passengers and crew members and 49 people on the ground.
	An Airbus A300 flown by Garuda Indonesia crashed on approach to Medan in 1997, killing 234 people. Miscommunication between the pilots and air traffic control and a thick haze caused by forest fires were blamed in that crash. In December, Indonesia AirAsia Flight 8501 crashed in the Java Sea on a flight from the Indonesian city of Surabaya to Singapore, killing all 162 passengers and crew members aboard.
	In April, an F-16 fighter jet burst into flames on a runway at an air base in Jakarta, the capital. It was one of five F-16s that arrived from the United States last year. The Indonesian Air Force said at the time that it was grounding the four other jets while the cause of the accident was investigated.
	Mr. Soejatman, the aviation analyst, said the military had complained in the past that an American arms embargo, which was put in place in response to abuses in East Timor, had harmed its ability to maintain aircraft. But that embargo was lifted in 2005 and is no longer a valid excuse, he said.
	?We have to look at why this is happening,? he said. ?Back then it was easy to explain. Now we do not have an embargo. We have to see if this is because of a problem or if this was just a mishap.?
	The C-130, an American-built four-engine turboprop, is a workhorse cargo and passenger aircraft for militaries around the world. (New York Times)

Video: JVP to go alone at the election
	
The Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) said yesterday it would contest the general elections on its own and work hard to garner more votes and a majority in the next parliament.
	JVP Propaganda Secretary Vijitha Herath told a media briefing that they were finalising nominations for the election and said JVP Leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake, Politburo Member K.D. Lal Kantha and Lakshman Nipunaarachchi will contest from Colombo District.
	?We have already started our election campaign and at the moment we are consulting experts for advice on formulating our manifesto which will be completed within two weeks,? he said.
	Mr. Herath said he, Bimal Ratnayaka and WPC member Mahinda Jayasinghe will contest from the Gampaha District while WPC Member Nalinda Jayatissa will contest from the Kalutara District, Sunil Handunneththi from Matara, Samantha Vidyaratna from Badulla, Wasantha Samarasinghe from Anuradhapura, Gamini Ratnayaka from Kegalle, Nihal Galappaththi from Hambantota and Wasantha Peiris from Ampara.
	Mr. Herath said their party candidates will contest in all districts with the Northern and Eastern Provinces represented by members of the Tamil and Muslim communities.
	?Ramalingam Chandrasekaran will contest from the Jaffna District and soon complete nominations for the other district as well,? he said.
	While accusing President Maithripala Sirisena of needlessly delaying the dissolution of parliament, Mr. Herath said the President was acting in favour of the SLFP and thus nullifying the aspirations of the people at the January 8 presidential election.
	?The President and the Prime Minister initially promised to do so many things. However, they have only completed half of what they promised.? he said.
	Mr. Herath said the President was working hand-in-glove with several key figures of the Rajapaksa regime, which had been rejected by people.
	Meanwhile, he said the sale of Central Bank Bonds had proved that the UNP was no better than the former regime. ?They are making the country a safe haven for culprits,? Mr. Herath said.(Darshana Sanjeewa)

	The National Council for a Better Tomorrow Chairman Ven. Athuraliye Rathana Thera said today they would not be worried if former president Mahinda Rajapaksa returned to politics by contesting at the general elections.

	?It is not important if he contests or not. We have no intention of teaming up with politicians accused of being thugs, drug dealers, ethanol importers and rapists. We will have nothing to do with the former president if he intends working with the same set of corrupt politicians who were with him till his downfall. We are keeping on the political developments,? the Thera said. (Piyumi Fonseka)
