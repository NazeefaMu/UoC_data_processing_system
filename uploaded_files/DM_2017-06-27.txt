Assigning lotteries boards to FAM: JO seeks legal action
	
The joint opposition (JO) said today it would take legal action against the government decision to place the Development Lotteries Board (DLB) and the National Lotteries Board (NLB) under the purview of the Foreign Affairs Ministry by violating the Financial Act.
MP Bandula Gunawardena told a news conference that according to the Finance Act No.11 of 1963, it was the Finance Minister who was the minister authorized to regulate the NLB.
"Minister means the Minister to whom the subject or function of finance is assigned by the Prime Minister under Section 46 of the Ceylon (Constitution) Order in Council, 1946," he said quoting from the Act.
We ask Foreign Affairs Minister Ravi Karunanayake whether it was legal for him to administer the lotteries boards which came under the Finance Ministry previously. The Act clearly mentions that the members of the lotteries boards should be appointed by the Finance Minister, not the Foreign Minister, he said.
SLPP Chairman G.L. Peiris said not only was it a violation of the Financial Act it was also impractical. What does the foreign ministry or its secretary knows about the lotteries They have nothing to do with the lotteries board, he said.
A special gazette notification was issued on June 9 assigning the Development Lotteries Board and the National Lotteries Board to the Foreign Affairs Ministry. (By Lahiru Pothmulla)

Big Bang theory questioned
	

Stephen Hawkings vision on the creation of the universe are wrong, claims one of his closest friends. 
Professor Neil Turok, director of the Premeter Institute in Canada, has questioned the renowned theoretical physicists ideas on the Big Bang and the origins of the universe. 
Hawkings view that space, time and matter burst into existence at once with the Big Bang, has long been the centre of physics and cosmology studies.Turok has now released research suggesting that Hawkings maths was incorrect, saying that science should re-evaluate the claims. 
Our research implies that we either should look for another picture to understand the very early universe, or that we have to rethink the most elementary models of quantum gravity, Job Feldbrugge, one of Turoks co-authors, said. 
Hawking has disagreed with Turoks new theory, according to The Times.In the 1980s, Hawking and Professor Jim Hartle, from the University of California at Santa Barbara, proposed a model of the universe which had no boundaries in space or time.

Cabinet approval to acquire Dr. Neville Fernando Hospital
	
The Cabinet has approved a proposal permitting the government to take over the Neville Fernando Hospital attached to the South Asia Institute of Technology and Management (SAITM), Highways and Higher Education Minister Lakshman Kiriella said today.
However, he said the government had decided to allow SAITM to function as a non-state medical college despite demands by student unions of state universities and the Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) to nationalize it.
Minister Kiriella told Daily Mirror today that Dr. Neville Fernando was prepared to handover the hospital to be administered by the government and had not sought any compensation for doing so.
The hospital property is valued at Rs.3.5 billion. Yet, Dr. Fernando is ready to hand it over without compensation. It will be administered by a board of management and its ownership broad-based, he said adding that the government would abide by the Court of Appeal ruling and as such SAITM would be allowed to function as a private medical college.
Minister Kiriella and Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne submitted the Cabinet memorandum. (Kelum Bandara)

Chinas fastest bullet train Fuxing debuts
	

THE HINDU, 26th JUNE, 2017 
Chinas indigenous next generation bullet train, with a maximum speed of 400 kmph, made its debut today on the countrys busiest Beijing-Shanghai line. Fuxing, or rejuvenation, a CR400AF model, departed Beijing South Railway Station at 11:05 AM for Shanghai. At the same time, a CR400AF model left Shanghai Hongqiao Railway Station for Beijing. The train took about five hours and 45 minutes to reach Shanghai. On its way, it stopped at 10 stations, including Jinan, Shandong province and Tianjin. The new bullet trains, also known as electric multiple units (EMU), boast a top speed of 400 kilometres per hour and a consistent speed of 350 kilometres an hour, state-run Xinhua news agency reported. The Beijing- Shanghai line, the countrys busiest route, is used by 505000 passengers daily. The train was designed and manufactured by China, the report said. 
The train includes a sophisticated monitoring system that constantly checks its performance and automatically slows the train in case of emergencies or abnormal conditions. A remote data-transmission system, a control centre will be able to monitor the train in real time, it said.

Chronic Kidney Disease and the Presidential Task Force
	
Chronic Kidney Disease of unknown Etiology (CKDu) has been reported from 10 districts in the country. The cases are mostly in the North Central, Uva, North Western and Central Provinces. According to the Health Ministry, the number of CKDu patients in 2010 was 29,336. By 2014, this number increased to around 40,000. The current data is not available but according to press reports, nearly 60,000 people have been affected by CKDu. President Maithripala Sirisena appointed a presidential task force (PTF) in 2014 due to the gravity of the problem. The primary objective of the task force was to take prompt, appropriate action to prevent the spread of this fatal disease in co-ordination with the respective government and non-governmental organizations. Ironically, the number of patients suffering from CKDu has continually and significantly increased. The website of PTF does not indicate the number of CKDu affected people. The disease has now spread to a number of areas such as Mahiyanganaya and Girandurukotte, which hitherto were relatively free from CKDu, indicating the inadequate action taken by the Task Force. 
An International Expert Consultation on CKDu was held in 2016 from 27-29 April in Colombo. This was organized jointly by the World Health Organization (WHO) Country Office for Sri Lanka and the Presidential Task Force on CKDu (PTF). At the conclusion of this meeting, 27 recommendations were made. One of the recommendations of this consultation was to establish community-based disease surveillance to understand the burden, geographical distribution and time trends of CKDu in Sri Lanka. Almost one year has passed since this consultation was held and the PTF appear to not have taken any action to implement this recommendation. 

"The cases are in North Central, Uva, North Western and Central Provinces."
In order to ensure and facilitate implementation of this National Action Plan, a framework for monitoring, implementation and accountability was presented. The PTF is to be the focal point for the proposed inter-sectoral coordinating mechanism, but the PTF appears not to have taken realistic action connected with the proposed three-pronged framework. 
CKDu is considered to be of multi-factorial origin. A recent review by the International Water Management Institute (IWMI) (ref. IWMI Working Paper 158) indicates that no specific substance/compound has been proven to cause CKDu. Research studies carried out to-date indicate that drinking contaminated water is the main cause of this disease. Therefore, it is important to provide clean water to all inhabitants of CKDu affected and surrounding villages. Hence, the PTF needs to have an effective programme to supply good-quality water to those in the CKDu affected areas. But there appears to be no effective plan to supply good quality water to the affected areas. To achieve this objective, it is necessary to know the number of affected people in the different DS divisions. This information is not available. 

"The President appointed a presidential task force (PTF) in 2014 to look into the problem."
During the last few years, hundreds of research studies related to CKDu have been conducted. Contributions on CKDu by professionals are given in the website maintained by the Coordinating Secretariat for Science, Technology and Innovation (COSTI). However, there is no definite conclusion on what causes CKDu. One of the recommendations of the International Expert Consultation was to establish a consortium of national/international researchers to conduct long-term interdisciplinary research on this issue. PTF appears to have taken no action in this regard. 
The 2017 budget allocated Rs.100 million to the National Science Foundation to conduct studies related to CKDu. However no action appears to have been taken by PTF to initiate this study. As the main authority on CKDu in Sri Lanka, it is crucial that the PTF takes relevant action immediately to prevent/control CKDu which is creating hardships for thousands of people.

However, informed sources say that this high-up has bought a Mercedes Benz on hire-purchase involving 60 monthly instalments of Rs.525,000 each when he has already got a Montero jeep in a sound condition at his disposal. This jeep is the vehicle that his predecessor used.

Fintech poised for mainstream adoption on a global scale: EY
	
Levels of financial technology (fintech) adoption among consumers has surged globally over the past 18 months and is poised to be embraced by the mainstream, according to the latest EY FinTech Adoption Index. An average of 33 percent digitally active consumers across the 20 markets in the EY study, now use fintech.
The study, based on 22,000 online interviews with digitally active consumers across 20 markets, shows that the emerging markets are driving much of this adoption with China, India, South Africa, Brazil and Mexico averaging 46 percent.
China and India in particular have seen the highest adoption rates of fintech at 69 percent and 52 percent, respectively. Fintech firms in these countries are particularly successful at tapping into the tech-literate but financially underserved segments, according to the study.
The UK has also shown significant growth, with adoption rates now standing at 42 percent.
Payment services and insurance are driving adoption
The EY FinTech Adoption Index evaluates services offered by fintech organisations under five broad categories  money transfers and payments services, financial planning, savings and investments, borrowing and insurance. It reveals that money transfers and payments services are continuing to lead the fintech charge with adoption standing at 50 percent in 2017, based on the consumers that were surveyed.
Eighty eight percent of respondents said they anticipate using fintech for this purpose in the future. The new services that have contributed to this upsurge include online digital-only banks and mobile phone payment at checkout.
Insurance has also made huge gains, moving from being one of the least commonly used fintech services in 2015 to the second most popular in 2017, now standing at 24 percent. According to the study, this has largely been due to the expansion into technologies such as telematics and wearables (helping companies to better predict claim probability) and in particular the inclusion and growth of premium comparison sites.
Advisory Leader for Sri Lanka and Maldives EY Arjuna Herath says, Fintechs are clearly gaining widespread traction across global markets and have achieved the early stages of mass adoption in most countries. The EY FinTech Adoption Index finds, on average, one in three consumers already consume fintech services on a regular basis.
Fintechs, particularly in the payments and insurance space, have been very successful in building on what they do best  using technology in novel ways and having a laser-like focus on the customer. It really is now a critical time for traditional financial services companies. If they havent already, they need to urgently reassess their business models to ensure they are able to meet their customers rapidly changing needs. Disruption is no longer just a risk  it is an undisputable reality.
Fintech users are also actively using sharing economy and on-demand services
According to the study, 40 percent of fintech users regularly use on-demand services (e.g. food delivery), while 44 percent of fintech users regularly participate in the sharing economy (e.g. car sharing). In contrast, only 11 percent of non-fintech adopters use either of these services on a regular basis.
The demographic most likely to use fintech are millennials  2534-year olds, followed by 3544-year olds. The study revealed that people in this age range are comfortable with the technology and that they also require a wide range of financial services as they achieve milestones such as completing their education, gaining full-time employment, becoming homeowners and having children.
There is however also growing adoption among the older generations: 22 percent of digitally active 4564-year olds and 15 percent of those over 65 said they regularly use fintech services.
The study has also identified a new segment of users, the super-user. These individuals use five or more fintech services and account for 13 percent of all consumers. Super-users generally consider fintech firms to be their primary providers of financial services.
Fintech adoption set to increase to 52% globally
The EY FinTech Adoption Index says that fintech adoption is set to increase in all 20 markets covered by the study. Based on consumers intention of future use, fintech adoption could increase to an average of 52 percent globally. The highest proportional increases of intended use among consumers are expected in South Africa, Mexico and Singapore.
EY Global Fintech Leader Imran Gulamhuseinwala says, There are those who believe that fintechs struggle to translate the innovation and great customer experience that they create into real customer adoption. The EY FinTech Adoption Index suggests that thinking is now outdated.
Fintechs are not only becoming significant players in the financial services industry, but are also shaping its future. Their new propositions are increasingly attractive to consumers and this trend is only set to continue as awareness grows, concerns are allayed and new advancements are made.
Traditional firms, which sometimes struggle to deliver the same seamless and personalised user experiences, will undoubtedly need to step up their efforts to remain competitive. I think its likely that we will see greater collaboration between traditional firms and fintechs in the future.

Govt. says no to LNG power plant in Sampur
	
In a surprising turn of events, the government has decided not to go ahead with the two proposed Indian and Japanese-funded Liquid Natural Gas (LNG) power plants in Sampur, Power and Renewable Energy Minister Ranjith Siyambalapitiya said today.
He said that instead a 50 MW solar power plant would be constructed there.
The agreement to set up a 500 MW coal power plant with Indian investment was signed in August 2011 and the construction agreement was finalized in October, 2013 as a joint venture between the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) and India's Natural Thermal Power Corporation Ltd. (NTPC).
The agreement was later scrapped because of protests from people in Trincomalee, the Tamil National Alliance (TNA) and the anti-coal lobby. Sri Lanka then requested India to convert the coal power plant into an LNG powered power plant to which India agreed but warned of pitfalls in switching over from coal to LNG.
However, there was a heavy pressure from the engineers union of the CEB against the construction of an LNG powered plant in Sampur.
The minister told the media that the CEB would give priority to set up environment-friendly green energy-powered power plants using solar and wind power.
He said 20 investors had been selected to set up 60 small-scale solar power plants of one MWs and the CEB would purchase power from them at Rs.12.73 a unit thus reducing the average price of a unit.
Commenting on the proposed trade union action by CEB employees, the minister said a pay rise was given to engineers in 2015 and a 30% salary increase to all employees in 2015 under the terms of the collective agreement.
It is not an easy task to give across the board pay hikes to all 22,000 employees. We are deeply concerned about their grievances and I will submit a memo at the next Cabinet meeting. I request all CEB employees to maintain restraint and be patient until we find a solution to their problems through dialogue, the minister said.
Deputy Minister Ajith Perera requested the CEB employees to resolve the pay issue amicably without harm to the services provided by the CEB.
We have recruited 6,300 employees who had earlier served the CEB from outsource companies. Our aim is to convert the entire power sector a single smart grid and employee cooperation is vital for that, he said. (Sandun A Jayasekera)

## Title: Growing political sanction for  religious violence  in South Asia

Growing political sanction for  religious violence  in South Asia
	
Apart from poverty and corruption, violence rooted in religious intolerance has become a hallmark of South Asian countries. And, as in the case of poverty and corruption, the State and the polity are complicit in violent religious intolerance. 
In Hindu-majority North India, cow protection vigilantes called Gau Rakshaks lynch Muslims with impunity, alleging that they ate beef or were taking cattle for slaughter. In Sunni-Muslim majority Pakistan, a loosely worded blasphemy law is used to arrest, prosecute and sentence to death non-Sunni Muslim minorities and non-Muslims like Christians and Hindus. Mobs have no compunction about lynching suspects and society and polity view lynching as natural justice. 
In Muslim-majority Bangladesh, secular bloggers, atheists and gay rights activists were branded as enemies of Islam and murdered in cold blood till last year when Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina came down on the perpetrators with an iron hand. In Sri Lanka, the State machinery and the polity are silent spectators as a Buddhist monk freely indulges in hate speech and exhorts his followers to burn Muslim shops and mosques. 
Majoritarianism
Despite claims to the contrary and the existence of democratic structures and laws, the South Asian state is quintessentially an institution of the majority community for the majority community. The State looks on nonchalantly or even approvingly, as members of the majority community attack and even kill minorities and dissenters. The State tacitly approves these acts in the belief that stopping the attackers or punishing them will alienate it from the majority community. 
In India, murdering Muslims for trading in cattle or eating beef is seen by the ruling dispensation as implementation of its Hindutva ideology - the ideology of Hindu nationalism which seeks to establish Hindu supremacy through the subjugation of minorities and dissenters. The perpetrators of violence are either not arrested or are let off the hook. 
In Pakistan, a simple allegation of blasphemy (even in the slightest form), is enough for arrest and prosecution. Since the accuser has the upper hand, the accused is sentenced to death as the law makes it mandatory. The courts themselves deem it a religious duty to be harsh on the accused as blasphemy is deemed an unpardonable crime in Pakistan. 
Alleged blasphemers are sometimes lynched by self-righteous mobs or are killed by fellow prisoners or jail guards. These murders go unpunished as they are deemed by society and the polity to be meritorious. 

"In a society where primordial loyalties are strong, religious affinity proved to be a more attractive and effective rallying point than class interest"

Deep Rooted Communalism
Communalism has been at the core of politics in the Indian sub-continent from pre-independence days and was the basis of the division of the Indian sub-continent into a largely Hindu India and a Muslim Pakistan. But under the enlightened leadership of Mahatma Gandhi and Jawaharlal Nehru, independent India chose to be secular and was largely so, till economic crises and Indira Gandhis authoritarian rule set off political and social unrest which spawned communalism. 
Hindu chauvinistic/nationalist forces, which were dormant after independence, began to find favour among a section of the middle class as the Left of Centre Congress and the Leftist parties jaded in the 1970s and 1980s. In a society where primordial loyalties are strong, religious affinity proved to be a more attractive and effective rallying point than class interest. 
In the 1970s and 1980s, Hindu chauvinistic forces drew sustenance from the rise of fundamentalist Islam emanating from the oil-rich Middle East. In the mid-1980s, Indias arch enemy Pakistan, got highly Islamized under the rule of Gen.Zia-ul-Haq. Its fall out was felt in the Muslim-majority Indian state of Kashmir, where protests against Indian rule reached new heights. 
However, it took several years for the Hindutwa forces to capture State power. The Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) to come to power at the Centre virtually on its own, only in March 2014. 

"Sharpening the Hindu-Muslim divide, Modi as Prime Minister, has given up the long established tradition of holding Iftar parties during Ramazan"

Once ensconced in power, the BJP and its ideological allies called Sangh Parivar set about whipping up Hindu nationalism to consolidate and expand its political base. The easiest way of doing so was to target the Muslims, the quintessential other in India, and the community which broke up India to establish a separate Muslim Pakistan. 
The ancient concept of the Holy Cow and the ban on beef eating were revived, not to safeguard the cow, but to target the Muslims who eat beef and slaughter cows. 
Gau Rakshaks or cow vigilante groups mushroomed to number several thousands by 2016. When tipped off, these vigilante groups would attack and lynch the suspected Muslims. Those killed so far range from 58 year old Mohamand Ikhlaq from Dadri in Uttar Pradesh, to 15 year old Hafiz Junaid in Ballabhgarh near Delhi. 
The State apparatus sides with the vigilantes under the cloak of the Indian constitution which bans the slaughter of milch cattle, though cattle taken for slaughter dont yield milk. A recently passed law, which makes it very difficult to sell cattle in the market, is meant to destroy the meat industry which is largely in the hands of Muslims. According to the Economist armed Gau Rakshaks prey on cattle transporters on highways, extorting money at the rate of Indian Rs. 200 per head of cattle. 

"Communalism has been at the core of politics in the Indian sub-continent from pre-independence days and was the basis of the division of the Indian sub-continent into a largely Hindu India and a Muslim Pakistan"

Marginalization of Muslims
Alienating the Muslims is no longer considered politically costly. Modi proved in the Uttar Pradesh State Assembly elections recently that polls can be won comfortably without fielding a single Muslim candidate. 
Sharpening the Hindu-Muslim divide, Modi as Prime Minister, has given up the long established tradition of holding Iftar parties during Ramazan. He also makes it a point not to attend Iftar parties, even if hosted by the President of India. Taking the cue from him, other parties are also giving up the practice, thus giving up even a symbolic acknowledgment of Indias largest minority and its second largest religious community. 

"The perpetrators of violence are either not arrested or are let off the hook"

Blasphemy in Pakistan
Meanwhile in Pakistan, efforts to revise the blasphemy law, which have led to a rash of convictions and lynching, have failed in the face of opposition from ultra radical Islamic groups and Mullahs who consider it inviolable. 
Those seeking reform or pleading for mercy towards alleged blasphemers are murdered. Punjab Governor Salman Taseer and Minority Affairs Minister Shahbaz Bhatti were assassinated for this, and the assassins were publicly lauded. This despite the fact that a survey conducted by the Nation newspaper found that 68% wanted the blasphemy law repealed. 
In Bangladesh, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasinas zero tolerance of religious killings after the July 1 ,2016 massacre in a posh restaurant in Dhaka, has put an end to such killings, clearly showing what the State could do if it wanted to control religious killings.

While promising to upgrade waste disposal services in the province, Western Province Chief Minister Isuru Devapriya said laws would be introduced to stop people from transporting and dumping garbage.
He told a news briefing that he had requested local government authorities to submit a report on the labour and machinery requirements to provide a comprehensive service with regard to garbage disposal.
We will recruit more labour and purchase more machinery no sooner we receive the relevant information, he said adding that once the necessary infrastructure and an acceptable garbage disposal service was in place, new laws would be introduced banning people transporting and disposing garbage.
Only institutions handling garbage will be given the authority to transport garbage, the CM said.
Referring to the piles of garbage dumped on street corners across Colombo, he said the situation was being gradually resolved.
Local government authorities were not the only ones who dumped garbage at Meethotamulla, there were private parties as well. The new laws will ban them from doing so, the CM said adding that the residents dumping unsegregated waste on roadsides were the other culprits.
We thank the military and the police for arresting these errant individuals and taking legal action against them, the Chief Minister said. (Darshana Sanjeewa)

Insomnia is in your genes, not all in your head
	

(Daily Mail,), 26 June 2017 -  If you toss and turn at night struggling to nod off, you may think stress is to blame for your whirring brain. 
But the real explanation may lie deep within your genetic make-up. 
A Dutch study has identified seven genes that put people at increased risk of developing sleeplessness. 
Their discovery, that a tendency to suffer sleep problems is biological, rather than psychological, is a whole new approach and gives hope to the third of adults who have sleep problems. 
It means that targeted treatments could be developed, rather than the ten million prescriptions for sleeping tablets that are made each year. 
The research, by scientists at Vrije University in Amsterdam, was carried out by mapping the DNA of more than 113,000 people from Britain and the Netherlands.Our research brings a new perspective. Insomnia is also in the genes. The professor, whose work is published in the Nature Genetics journal, said

Irangani Serasinghe: the mother of all our mothers
	
Irangani Serasinghe, the mother of all mothers in our cinema, turned 90 last week. What better time to examine how her performances have had an impact on our movies, culturally and aesthetically.
Irangani Serasinghe is the only actress I can think of from here who has never tap danced, cha-chaed or freestyled to a song in a commercial movie. Nearly everyone else from Malini Fonseka to Swarna Mallawarachchi has done so. Swarna in particular, with Anjana, proved to the public that even the most serious actor has to endure the mainstream, formulaic cinema, a truism which is valid for any film industry, anywhere. Once in a while you do come across a Dhritiman Chatterjee who, by extraordinary resolve, excludes himself or herself from commercial movies and becomes, for the lack of a better way of putting it, a selective player. But being the exception, they are generally hard to find, harder to fit in. 


"Mothers come in different shades. They are products of the myths and fairy-tales we grew up on and to a considerable extent, they are aware of, but pretend to ignore the futility of clinging on to their sons and daughters."

With Irangani you come across a different actor, a different player. Born to privilege, she rebelled against it but never quite abandoned it. She flirted with Marxism in the forties via Professor Ludowyke and moved away when (as she informs us in Kumar de Silvas lighthearted book on her, by her) she felt that Marxism would take her away from the only person she knew well: herself. That sweet, almost nave course of self-discovery (how many Marxists do you know who can give the same reason for their later recantations) is what makes up nearly every later performance of hers. 
Like Marxists, mothers come in different shades. They are products of the myths and fairy-tales we grew up on and to a considerable extent, they are aware of, but pretend to ignore the futility of clinging on to their sons and daughters. The tragedy of societies like ours is that we are confused when it comes to this issue: we want to move on with the rest of the world, but the past always haunts us, stunting our instincts while leaving us with the odd impression that for all their superficial lack of understanding, our mothers probably know more about the past, present and future, than we ever can. And yet we rebel, being the prodigals we are. 
Irangani Roxana Serasinghe, who is a mother and grandmother and has known the poignancy of being both, has played more matriarchal figures than any other actor here. We first saw her in Lester James Peries Rekava, where for all we cared, she didnt have a husband or father to her son. When that brute of a man who is her husband brings home some of the jewels and purses hes robbed, she throws them away with disgust. Rekava was the only production that had her in that milieu, that setting, so she could afford to be disgusted in the coarsest, most vulgar way possible. But the director seemed to have misunderstood the milieu: the fact is that the only thing local about Rekava was Irangani, the first Sri Lankan mother to be featured in a movie. Lester had cast her. And she redeemed him. She was his first choice for the role of Matara Hamine in Gamperaliya but because she was pregnant, he opted for Shanthi Lekha, a temperamentally different performer. Again, the actress redeemed him, this time by accident: even back then, Irangani would have been too assertive to depict her character, as quietly but rigidly traditionalist as she was, the way Lekha did. None of my mothers are ever the same, Irangani told me two years ago. Thats true but she was telling only half the story: those different mothers were variations of the matriarch who was adamant in deciding the destinies of her sons and daughters until she discovered that they were more adamant than her. Matara Hamine was not that kind of figure. 

Right after Gamperaliya, Lester made Delovak Athara with his producer and friend Anton Wickremasinghe, shooting down the idea of filming Kaliyugaya and Yuganthaya. (It was one of those rare instances where a Sri Lankan producers instinct for serious cinema proved to be right.) Delovak Athara was different to say the least: it belonged to Raoul Coutard, the New Wave and the intellectual cinema of the sixties that would dissolve into the political cinema of the seventies. In it he cast Irangani, again as the mother, moving her to a milieu she was comfortable in. When she found her footing there, naturally, she let herself out and became more expressive. 
Because of that, she is a treat to watch in Lesters movie. Not only is she constrained by her social status, she also has only one child, a son, so since shes afraid of losing him, she obsesses over his every move. Theres a sequence where the son (Nissanka, played by Tony Ranasinghe) reveals his role in an accident to his betrothed (Shirani, played by the gracefully rotund Jeevarani Kurukulasuriya) while the latter is to perform at a concert. She breaks down, predictably and Nissankas mother, enraged, confronts the son at home later that night. The father (played J.B.L. Gunasekera) knows about the accident. She does not. Nissanka slowly reveals the truth to her. 

	With Irangani you come across a different actor. Born to privilege, she rebelled against it but never quite abandoned it.
	
	
	She has played more matriarchal figures than any other actor here.
	
	
	The only thing local about Rekava was Irangani, the firstSri Lankan mother to be featured in a movie.
	
	
	She always kept you expecting an argument, an explosion of some sort but never delivered it in fortissimos.
	
	
	None of my mothers are ever the same
	
She sits at once, aghast and looks down. The son goes on about how difficult it has been for him to live with his conscience and to keep it a secret from everyone around him.
He gets up and starts to leave the room, looking at the mother, now numb, now speechless. Youd think shed be numb and speechless for that entire sequence, but no: just as hes about to leave she exclaims, not over the dilemma hes in, but over an entirely different matter: You didnt trust me enough to tell me what youd got yourself into, did you Nissanka has enough on his plate already. Nissankas mother on the other hand, is only bothered by the fact that she wasnt told, which she takes as a sign that he doesnt trust her. This interplay of domination and distrust is what drives much of the plot and the conflicts in Delovak Athara. 

In the sixties and seventies, Irangani got to portray that kind of mother. We knew she was wrong and that as long as she was wrong, her children could never resolve their conflicts. But although she wasnt in the right, she didnt flaunt it. She rarely raised her voice, for instance, because if she did, she wouldnt have been any different to other actors cast as mothers elsewhere. She always kept you expecting an argument, an explosion of some sort but never delivered it in fortissimos. (Part of the reason for that was, I think her slowness when speaking in Sinhala.) Not even in Ran Salu, where she had to endure a daughter who, entranced by a Buddhist nun, takes after a less materialistic, more frugal lifestyle. All she can do is mutter under her breath, since after all it is a Buddhist nun and they are at least nominally Buddhist. 
In the eighties and nineties, she changed. Sometimes she never gets our sympathy, as in Deveni Gamana, where she and Denawaka Hamine unleash the irrational fury of their village at a daughter-in-law who cant prove her virginity. Who told her to engage in those things she angrily asks her son, as he tries to stand up for his wife with the excuse that she used to play basketball and that can explain why she didnt bleed on their first night together. She refuses to see the light: she thinks she knows what is correct, even though we know she may not be correct. 


This wasnt too far away from her roles in the sixties. But then she was undergoing a transformation. She was mellowing, becoming more empathetic, more correct. By the nineties, that transformation was complete. In Doo Daruwo (along with every other Nalan Mendis film), Awaragira and Loku Duwa, she became the obverse of what she was: the most she can do now is to bemoan the disobedient son, the wayward prodigal, who in the latter two happened to be Kamal Addararachchi. 
When Punna in Loku Duwa (Geetha Kumarasinghe) tentatively says that to cut down on expenses, she is willing to marry her fianc (Jackson Anthony) without the obligatory poruwa ceremony, Irangani looks down: Either we do something properly, or we dont do it at all. But there isnt that same sharply delivered bitterness we get from Nissankas or Sujathas mother: she says it not because shes embittered, but because she truly, deeply cares about her child without worrying about their social and economic standing. She never got an only son or daughter in these movies, moreover: there is always more than one, sometimes more than two, and in her oscillating attitudes to them we sense a wider range and virtuosity in her. 
At the heart of those mothers she has depicted a paradox. Caught between two worlds of conformity and of individuality, they have grasped the paradox at the heart of all our mothers: that of standing up for ones offspring while placating an impersonal world. From Rekava to Deveni Gamana, to Loku Duwa and beyond, she has reconciled these two opposites the same way Chaplin did (through Monsieur Verdoux and Limelight) when it came to the funnily good and the starkly evil that coexisted in his world: by ageing gracefully. And elegantly.

Lankan nabbed with Rs. 25mn worth gold jewellery
	
A 35-year-old Sri Lankan man was arrested at the Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA) last night while he was attempting to smuggle gold jewellery worth Rs. 25 million into the country, BIA Deputy Customs Director Parakrama Basnayake said.
He said the suspect was arrested around 11.35 pm with more than two kilograms of gold jewellery at the customs Green Channel after he arrived at BIA from Bangkok. The gold jewellery was found hidden inside his luggage.
The gold jewellery was found with pearls and diamonds embedded in them. The suspect was a businessman from Bandaragama area in Horana, he said.
Mr. Basnayake said this suspect was previously arrested for similar offence and released after Rs. 100,00 fine imposed.
The jewellery (rings, necklaces, bangles and bracelets) was found in four transparent parcels concealed inside one of his baggages. The suspect used to bring the jewellery under the guise of importing shoes.
The jewellery was found when the customs officers tried to expand the luggage. The assessment of the jewellery was done by the Gem and Jewellery Department specialists and valued at Rs. 25 million, he said.
Due to the high customs security at the BIA, smugglers used to seek support of airport officers, security officers and duty free shop employees when transporting their counterfeits, drugs and illegal goods, he said.
The raid was carried out by the Assistant Customs Superintendents Duncan Hettiarachchi, Ajith Ilesinghe and Lasath Dharmasena. The Investigation was carried out under the supervision of Customs Director Rohitha Uduvawala and Deputy Customs Director Parakrama Basnayake. (Chaturanga Pradeep, T.K.G.

May strikes $1.3 billion deal for support from Northern Irish party
	

Prime Minister Theresa May struck a deal on Monday to prop up her minority government by agreeing to at least 1 billion pounds ($1.3 billion) in extra funding for Northern Ireland in return for the support of the provinces biggest Protestant party.
After more than two weeks of talks amid political turmoil sparked by Mays failure to win a majority in a June 8 snap election, May can now be sure her government can pass a budget and Brexit legislation.
May and Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) leader Arlene Foster presided at the signing of a three-page so called confidence and supply deal at Downing Street that is some way short of a more formal coalition agreement.
The deal means the DUPs 10 lawmakers will now vote in support of Mays 318 Conservatives in the 650-seat parliament on the budget, legislative agenda, motions of confidence and Brexit.
In return, May agreed to least 1 billion pounds ($1.3 billion) in extra funding over two years for Northern Ireland, agreeing to raise pensions annually by at least 2.5 percent and to keep universal winter fuel payments for the elderly.
I welcome this agreement which will enable us to work together in the interest of the whole United Kingdom, give us the certainty we require as we embark on our departure from the European Union, and help us build a stronger and fairer society at home, May said in a statement.
May laced her deal with an attempt to end Northern Irelands political crisis by stipulating the money would only be released to a power-sharing executive in Belfast, upping pressure on the DUP to make an agreement with their Catholic nationalist rivals.

## Title: NDBIB becomes first Lankan investment bank to manage an offshore IPO

NDBIB becomes first Lankan investment bank to manage an offshore IPO
	

NDB Investment Bank (NDBIB) successfully raised US $ 28 million (Rs.4.2 billion) via the initial public offering (IPO) of Ooredoo Maldives PLC, a subsidiary of Qatar-based international telecommunications giant Ooredoo Group, which is present in over 10 countries with a total subscriber base of over 138 million.
NDBIB was awarded the mandate to act as the lead financial advisor and manager to the IPO via an international bidding process, which involved the participation of many regional investment banks. This is the first time an investment bank in Sri Lanka has acted as the financial advisor and manager to an IPO on foreign soil. 
The IPO attracted over 10,000 applications and was structured as an offer for sale raising funds amounting to an approximate 10 percent stake in Ooredoo Maldives with NDBIB valuing the company at US $ 287 million. The IPO has resulted in Ooredoo Maldives being one of the largest listed companies in the Maldives and the entity with the largest free-float-adjusted market capitalisation on the MSE.
The transaction assumed greater significance for being the first IPO with a fully online and integrated electronic application process. The prospective shareholders were allowed to apply for shares in Ooredoo Maldives via a special online portal where the depository account opening and shareholder applications were submitted online together with soft copies of all supporting documentation.
The online portal also offered multiple payment options such as credit and debit card payments and mobile money payments. NDBIB along with the company worked in close collaboration with the Capital Market Development Authority of Maldives and MSE to secure expeditious approval for the IPO whilst maximising the retail investor participation via awareness campaigns. 
NDBIB together with Ooredoo Maldives devised an all-encompassing distribution strategy aimed at managing the logistical challenges in the Maldives given the fact that the archipelagos population of over 400,000 is scattered across 1,200 islands.
The distribution strategy included one-on-one meetings with key high-net-worth individuals and institutional investors, local roadshows in main population centres accessed through domestic planes and speed boats and town hall meetings addressing professionals, students and other potential retail investors, staff storming the streets once a week across islands and a wide network of collection points including post offices, bank branches and Ooredoo distribution partners. This strategy reaped successful results by attracting one of the largest ever shareholder bases in listed Maldivian entities exceeding 8,000 applicants where c. 5000 applicants were first time investors.
Ooredoo Maldives has been a trailblazer in the Maldivian telecommunications industry achieving a stellar growth story since commencing commercial operations in 2005 as the second telco operator in the Maldives. Ooredoo Maldives has invested over US $ 194 million since its inception to provide best-in-class 4G connectivity to the entirety of the Maldives. The company recorded revenue of US $ 105 million and profit after tax of US $ 32 million for FY 2016.
The mobile telecommunications industry of the Maldives has achieved a substantial surge in the number of subscribers to 812,128 in 2016 (c.t. 494,351 in 2010) and an increase in smartphone adoption, which have led to a staggering mobile penetration of 229.9 percent in 2016. This mobile penetration rate is amongst the highest in the world due to many users having multiple broadband compatible devices and the prevalence of dual SIM cards among a majority of the population in order to economise their spending on telecommunications services.
Additionally, favourable population demographics, ubiquitous connectivity throughout the archipelago and the increasing consumption of content predominantly due to the Maldives being an island nation have augmented growth in per capita data usage placing Ooredoo Maldives in a position to capitalise on such favourable industry dynamics.
Commenting on the IPO, NDBIB CEO Darshan Perera stated, The exemplary competence and the diverse experience portrayed by our team over the years enabled NDBIB to secure the transaction and successfully execute the same within the stipulated timelines. We deployed a relatively large transaction team to work on different aspects of the IPO and I am delightful to have completed this landmark transaction successfully exceeding the expectations of the client.
He further added, The presence of sound companies in the Maldives and NDBIBs involvement in landmark transactions of this nature, enhances the visibility and enables Sri Lanka to emerge as a regional hub for capital market fundraisings facilitating the proposed dual listing framework of the Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) promoted jointly by the CSE and MSE. 
This transaction comes hot on the heels of many other regional transactions carried out by NDBIB involving cross border mergers and acquisitions and syndicated loans involving both local and foreign financial institutions.

Sagala storms Cinnamon Gardens Police quarters
	
Law and Order Minister Sagala Ratnayake paid a surprise visit to the ten storey quarters building of the Cinnamon Gardens Police Station early yesterday and apparently appalled by its deplorable status, ordered immediate renovations to it, the Daily Mirror learns.
The minister who is said to have taken along Police Chief Pujith Jayasundara with him to the Cinnamon Gardens Police Station around 6.50 am had inspected the entire premises including the 10 storey living quarters of all junior police officers.
Minister Ratnayake who had gone for his morning exercises in the Torrington area early yesterday had reportedly asked IGP Jayasundara to join him in his daily PT session. He had then suddenly decided to visit the Cinnamon Gardens Police Station along with the IGP, with the latter having no knowledge on what the sudden visit was all about, the sources said.
The minister in his jogging kit had virtually climbed to the top floor of the building and checked for its condition which was not at all pleasing. None of the washrooms were equipped with working showers and water connections.
Garbage was found piled up in every nook and corner of the building along its stairway, where discarded cigarette butts and empty liquor bottles too were observed by the minister, the sources said.
The minister was surprised to learn that there was no lift for such a high-rise building that housed around 550 policemen, whose only bathing option was a water tank behind the building on the ground floor. Apart from the officials of the Cinnamon Gardens Police Station the building had been allocated for members of the Judicial Security Division (JSD) and State Intelligence Service (SIS).
After personally inquiring about the matters of the police officers using the building the Minister ordered the IGP to restore it with basic facilities within two months.
The IGP had then summoned all senior officials from ASP to the Senior Deputy Inspector General to the police station and conducted a separate conference for over a couple of hours explaining how to maintain their living surroundings. (Kurulu Koojana Kariyakarawana)

SL to establish diplomatic ties with new countries: Ravi
	
Foreign Affairs Minister Ravi Karunanayake said that the government intends to establish diplomatic ties with several new countries and it is important to give priority for commercial diplomacy.
The minister revealed this on Monday when he paid a courtesy call on the Chief Prelate of the Malwatte Chapter Most Venerable Thibbatuwawe Sri Sumangala Thera.
Minister Karunanayake told the Malwatte Mahanayake Thera that the rule of the Good Governance was able to change the negative image of the country and gain the support of the international community during the last two years.
He said that it seemed that certain diplomats do not take any attempt to create a positive image of the country among the international community and that the government appoints ambassadors to serve the country but not to enjoy a comfortable overseas stay during their tenure.
Steps have been taken to call back several such ambassadors as they have failed to perform their duties. The tax payers money is spent to maintain the staff members of missions who are sent on diplomatic service and, if such officers fail to perform their duty, the government would not hesitate to replace such diplomats, he said.
Responding to the Minister, the Mahanayake Thera said that employing talented youths in Foreign Service, instead of sending retired persons as heads of foreign missions, would be of paramount importance. (By Lahiru Pothmulla)

State lands to tycoon on a platter
	
Vast tracts of state-owned land along the coastal belt north of the town renowned for its pearls in ancient times have been parcelled out to several business tycoons on the orders of high political authorities.
It is a great injustice to give these lands to a few businessmen when there are a large number of people in this area who do not own even a small plot of land to erect a shelter, they say.
The businessmen who received these parcels of land on a platter ware already busy setting up prawn farms on them.

Straight from Ceylonese gardens to the  tea pot
	
Camellia Sinensis in Sri Lanka completes 150 years
Accidentally discovered in 2737 BC by the Chinese Emperor Shen Nung, today, tea is the most popular beverage, next to water with the Americans alone consuming approximately 650 million pounds a day; and over three billion cups are consumed daily worldwide. It was British planter, James Taylor who, at 17 years started a tea plantation in the 19-acre Loolecondera estate in Kandy and in five years he operated a fully equipped tea factory and the first sale of tea was made in Kandy in 1872. An year later the first shipment of Ceylon tea, a consignment of some 23 lb arrived in London. Today, it has since developed into a $1.6 billion export business for the teardrop shaped island nation. 
James Taylor of Loolecondera
44 years ago, and exactly 100 years after the first consignment of 23 pounds of Ceylon Tea was unloaded in English soil the writer happened to be in England on a visit. Then there was little international cricket and terrorism was in its infancy. Almost every young and old Englishmen to whom he was introduced as a Ceylonese, expressed ignorance, while an odd one exclaimed, Ah, thats where tea come from or the first woman Prime Ministers country Our country remained as Liptons Tea Estate to most of them. 
Sri Lanka is the worlds fourth-largest producer of tea. Tea production is one of the main sources of our foreign exchange and accounts for 2% of GDP, and contributed US $1.7 billion to the economy in 2015. Five percent of the population directly or indirectly is involved in the industry. Before Kenya overtook us in the mid-fifties, Sri Lanka was the worlds leading exporter of tea. In the recent pass it recorded a production of 340 million kg, which was the highest so far.

Liptons genius was in the marketing and distribution of the final product and his capacity to create and popularize witty slogans was legendary. Though shipped in bulk form, instead of selling it loose, as was the tradition at that time, Lipton sold his tea in well designed eye-catching packets under the slogan Straight from Ceylonese gardens to the tea pot. Liptons venture into tea was an enormous success. His 300 shops all over England soon could not keep up with the rising demand for his reasonably priced product, and so Lipton teas became popular in other stores around Britain. The name of Lipton became a trademark quickly to be well-known the world-over. Queen Victoria, a great admirer of the Lipton tea brand, in 1897 elevated Thomas Lipton to knighthood. 
Even as Sri Lanka became the worlds largest tea exporter in mid-sixties, the industry was still under the control by the British, who exported the tea in bulk form and branded it overseas.

Branding and Packaging
Early 1970s quite a few local men began dreaming of branding and packaging pure Ceylon tea, leaving out middlemen and generating more profits for island, which officially became known as Sri Lanka in 1972. But was hampered with government introducing two vicious rounds of land reform which delayed those positive steps and nearly wiped out our tea industry, but in 1980s two companies successfully launched their products in value added form, which have become Sri Lankas most recognized international brands. Sri Lankas packeted tea industry comprised 36 per cent of total exports, which is a resentment of the other major exporters, is dependent on the status of the Ceylon origin, thanks to Thomas Lipton who created the conceptCeylon TEA. 
World Tea Council records say, the 340 million kilograms of tea Sri Lanka exported in 2012, as the third highest by volume behind Kenya and China, and when measured in value terms it achieved the number two position. 
The first plant of camellia sinesis brought from China in 1824 by the British, who had colonized the island in 1818 was for display in the Royal Botanical Gardens Peradeniya in the countrys lush central hills. 
Tea Museum in the Hantana hill
There is a Tea Museum located in an abandon Tea Factory in the Hantana hill, a few kilometres West of Kandy, which is fairly popular among tourists but unfortunately only few locals visit the place. There you have the chance of viewing very old machinery used in the production of tea from the times of James Taylor, which is an excellent opportunity for anyone interested in the history or tea. Those who travel to Kandy should visit this Tea Museum which is spread over a few floors it offers an enthralling insight into this famous beverage. The guide will explain the various stages in the process, though not in working condition, showing you very early types of machinery used in the production. It takes four kgs of fresh leaves to produce one kg of dried tea. You need to spend only an hour and you can also enjoy a free cup of Orange Pekoe - Ceylons finest tea. 
The first public tea auction took place in 1883 following the establishment of the first broking firm, John Brothers & Co in 1876. It was held under the guidance of the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce. The Colombo Tea Traders Association was inaugurated in 1894 and the Tea Research Institute was established in 1925. These institutions facilitated boosting the industry in production and export of quality tea in its early stages. 
If we are to maintain and qualify as genuine Ceylon Tea, it must not only be grown, made, and packed entirely in Sri Lanka, but must also obey the rules to strict quality standards laid down and upheld by the Tea Board. Ceylon tea should not be mixed with any of the teas from another origin, as attempted by unscrupulous businessmen and must be completely pure and local. However a new policy has been formulated and presented to the Cabinet Committee on Economic Management by a high-level committee which studied blending of teas in Sri Lanka for the re-export of orthodox teas. According to the committees deliberations there are both risks and opportunities associated with a further liberalisation of theexisting policy. 

Teas that qualify to meet above standards may display the trademark Lion; a sword-wielding lion depicting the bravery of a lion on the Sri Lankan national flag. Sri Lanka is uniquely positioned, with close proximity to the equator that ensures a year round supply unlike in India and China. This has resulted in the ability to produce finest quality conventional black tea with the capability to acquire a quality over other origins. 
When the country changed its name from Ceylon to Sri Lanka in 1972, the tea industry struggled successfully to keep the widely-recognized name for its tea. Ceylon Tea has unique Characteristics being grown in seven regions spanning three levels of altitudes; Sri Lankas tea is Strong, dark, flavourful, complex, citrus and spicy as words frequently used to describe it.
Sir Thomas Lipton
Days of Liptons are forgotten since Unilevers bought over the company. But we are grateful to the entrepreneur, Sir Thomas Lipton for his untiring efforts and the slogan Straight from Ceylonese gardens to the tea pot. Today its Sri Lankan tea that they consume all over Europe and the States. The limited availability of the product, together with enhanced demand from our markets, prices have gone up further during the first quarter of 2017; in fact it had hit the zenith, though the total value of exports in terms of US$ has come down. 
The writers son, unlike his father, did not experience any embarrassments in identifying himself as a Sri Lankan in England. But faced pleasant dimness returning on holiday when all his English friends were reminding him, please do not forget some D. tea a particular brand of locally value-added tea which is extremely popular there. 
The Paradise Island, sun and rain Ceylon, presents the perfect climatic conditions for growing of tea. Sri Lanka brought a new dimension to tea by creating variations in quality, taste, character and appearance. Our tea with its distinct taste and quality has now turned out to be every consumers favourite cuppa. The British cleared the high grounds of traditional farming population and planted coffee, tea and rubber. They imported large numbers of south Indian Tamils as labourers to work in the plantations, who rapidly made up 7% of the countrys population. However, Line-rooms on the tea estates are dirty and unhealthy, congested, with no ventillation and lighting, soggy and cold with leaking roofs. Toilets blocked or broken. Each room is12 by 10 feet, and is built like barracks in two double rows, accommodating 24 housesone family occupying a room.The open drains unlined and clogged with effluent, cesspits overflowing into the living areas; a huge backlog of repairs unattended. Appalling conditions and low pay on tea plantations has been the order of the day until recently. 
Very high levels of malnutrition makes tea workers and their families vulnerable to diseases caused by unhygienic living conditions. The inhumane and abusive conditions were endemic throughout the industry. 
The exclusion of the estate labour from the state health service as in colonial times, the companies continue with substandard medical practitioners called Estate Medical Assistants (EMA), who have only the pharmacists certificate and a special test. They are trained in private hospitals, which lack proper standards.
