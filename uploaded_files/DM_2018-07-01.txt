CPC could halt fuel on credit to SriLankan from Wednesday: Chairman
	
Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) will be compelled to stop issuing aviation fuel on credit to the national carrier SriLankan Airlines from Wednesday (4) if they dont settle what is already owed, CPC Chairman Mr. Dammika Ranatunga said today.
Speaking to Daily Mirror, he said following a Cabinet decision last week, SriLankan had agreed to comply with the credit limit given.
SriLankan has to pay an outstanding of over Rs. 12 billion accrued over a period of three years to the CPC and will have to pay at least Rs. one billion of it before Wednesdays deadline to prevent an interruption to supply of fuel.
Last week the Inland Revenue Department froze CPCs bank accounts after it failed to pay the Value Added Tax (VAT) of Rs. 1.5 billion for the purchase of petroleum derivatives.
CPC has to collect unpaid dues amounting to around Rs. 70 billion, including Rs. 46 billion due to it from the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB).
SriLankan officials said their flight operations would be disrupted and many flights would have to be cancelled if the CPC maintains its hardline stance on the matter. 
Transport and Civil Aviation Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva and Petroleum Resources Development Minister Arjuna Ranatunga are to meet and hope to come to a compromise after Tuesdays Cabinet meeting. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

Pol Pots brothers call me Hitlers brother: MR
	
Those who call me Adolf Hitlers elder brother are Pol Pots younger brothers, former President Mahinda Rajapaksa told a public meeting held at Sri Visuddarama Temple in Mawathagama, Kurunegala.
He denied the allegation made by New York Times in its report, How China got Sri Lanka to cough up a port; he said it was a story planted by the present administration to attack him.
The countrys largest bond scam has created a situation in which various allegations are being levelled against current leaders in the government. To cover up their wrongdoings, they have contacted a paper from overseas and planted a story against us. I have invited them to investigate my bank accounts and even volunteered to provide my account numbers. I told them that if they find any wrongdoings I will take a knife and cut my throat. They are still searching for evidence, Mr. Rajapaksa said.
He said the Government not only wanted to sling mud at him, but also wanted to cover up their wrongdoings.
Mr. Rajapaksa said no international organisation had given them money; these were false allegations.
With regard to the upcoming provincial council elections he said some wanted it held under the previous system while others say that they want a new system.
Whatever method is used we will surely win, he added.
With reference to the 2020 presidential election he said his party would select a candidate who can follow the 'Mahinda Chinthana manifesto. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

Ranjan calls for a debate on New York Times allegations
	
Deputy Minister Ranjan Ramanayake yesterday said he will shortly move an adjournment debate on the New York Times report which alleged that a Chinese company had funded the campaign of Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa in January 2015.
Mr. Ramanayake told Daily Mirror that he intends moving an adjournment debate on the issue shortly as the allegation was serious. One cannot dismiss these allegations easily and therefore I will move for a debate in Parliament soon, he said.
Also he challenged former President Rajapaksa and others who had denied the story to send in a letter of demand to New York Times and then filed action against the newspaper if it fails to carry a clarification.
One local newspaper published a false story about me when I was contesting as the UNP chief ministerial candidate for Sabaragamuwa in 2008 and they compensated me by giving me a full page colour advertisement. Mr. Rajapaksa can do the same and take action against New York Times, he said.
Mr. Ramanayake who had already filed a complaint with FCID said he will also file a complaint with Bribery Commission as well. (Yohan Perera)

Ranjan is spinning what I told him on the phone- NY Times journo
	
South Asia correspondent at The New York Times, Maria Abi-Habib, who had written a controversial article titled How China Got Sri Lanka to Cough Up a Port, has rejected claims by Deputy Minister Ranjan Ramanayake and also said the deputy minister is spinning what she told him on the phone.
She was responding to a statement made by Dy Minister Ramanayake that her article was fully based on the B report given by the FCID.
Interesting because our article is based on many sources & I never tell anyone who my sources are (except my editors). This minister is spinning what I told him on the phone: that I would not help him and didn't want to get involved in political mud slinging. The article speaks for itself, she tweeted.
She also tweeted; Not true. As I did with #LKA media representing the govt and JO, I have declined all interviews & told the minister I wouldnt be involved in his political grandstanding. Article is based on multiple sources & I never reveal identities of sources unless to my editors. Nice try tho.

SL needs a leader who wants all beings to be happy - Sajith
	
Sri Lanka needs a leader who wants all beings to be happy and healthy as it is preached in Buddhism, Minister of Housing and UNP Deputy Leader Sajith Premadasa said over the weekend.
Mr. Premadasa said this during an opening of Sanda Dinu Gama reawaken village in Anuradhapura on Saturday.
We hear statements where some call for a Hitler type administration in this country. Some say the country need a Mussolini type of administration and others call for an Idi Amin type of administration. These are shameless statements, Mr. Premadasa said.
What this country need is a leader who wants beings to be happy and healthy as it is preached in Buddhism. We want people to live in this country, he added.
One should remember that Hitler killed thousands and thousands of Jews by using poison gas. He therefore, questioned as to how one could call for a Hitler type of administration in Sri Lanka.
Some claim that they meant that Buddhism in this county should be safeguarded when they called for a Hitler type of administration.
However, one cannot understand how Hitlers policies and Buddhism could be associated, he also said. (Yohan Perera)
