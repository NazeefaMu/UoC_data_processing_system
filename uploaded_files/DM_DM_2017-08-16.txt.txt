Bid to buy media outfit through a proxy
	

A story coming down the grapevine says that a Malaysian investor set to buy a leading media institution in the country is here now to negotiate the deal.

However, a very high political authority who smelled a rat about the mega dollar deal in the offing has deployed intelligence sleuths to find out whether there is more to it than meets the eye, they say.
By the way, a story that went viral a few months ago said the media institution in question was about to change hands, but that did not come to pass. There is a business network linked to this media institution and one of its entities is being run at a loss, they say. Those at the highest echelons in yahapalanaya are reportedly keen on ascertaining whether the Malaysian investor is a genuine one or a proxy of a certain local firm at the centre of a raging controversy here. They are also interested in making way for a friendly local investor to acquire it.
All present indications are that this media institution will become a bone of contention between the Blues and the Greens at the end of the day, informed sources say.

Constitution does not allow special court
	
Amid pressure from his colleagues, Justice Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe is reported to have ruled out the possibility of setting up a separate court to hear and dispense with cases of fraud and corruption involving members of the previous regime.
The Cabinet discussed what was described as inordinate delay in filing cases against them.
The minister is reported to have told the Cabinet that a separate court could not be set up because of Constitutional restrictions.
The Constitution has to be amended to provide for special courts.
However, he said that a trial-at-bar could be set up to hear these cases if the Chief Justice and the Attorney General were agreed on this matter.
Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne and Regional Development Minister Sarath Fonseka were among the ministers who pushed for speedy action against those accused of wrongdoing during the former regime.
Megapolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka is reported to have said the government had taken much too long to initiate action on these matters and that the cases had been delayed primarily because of political interests.
President Maithripala Sirisena sought the views of newly appointed Foreign Affairs Minister Tilak Marapana. Mr. Marapana also said the Constitution did not provide for a separate court to be set up and pointed out that special arrangements could be made within the current judicial system to hear such cases.

Demonstrating intimacy in public
	

There is a certain purohita who is considered a close confidant of a very high political authority. And now it has become an unofficially recognized practice to reserve for this purohita a seat next to that of the high political authority at all official public functions.

According to the usual procedure, organizers of very important public official functions reserve the two seats on either side of the chief guest for two VIPs high in order of precedence. But nowadays, a seat immediately next to the high political authority is invariably reserved for the purohita in question disregarding the time-honored order of precedence normally observed.
Organizers of public official functions which are to be attended by the high political authority and the favourite purohita are instructed to follow this seating arrangement by certain high-ups well ahead of the event, they say.

Emirates A380 lands at BIA: Proves resurfaced runway fit for any aircraft: Minister
	
The landing of the Emirates A380 aircraft at the Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA) proves that the newly resurfaced runway is suitable for the landing of any aircraft, Civil Aviation Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva said yesterday.
He said several media reports and some politicians had claimed that the runway, resurfaced after 30 years at a cost of Rs.7.2 billion, was not up to international standards and was unsuitable for large aircraft such as an A380 to land on.
The Aviation Ministry said the 3,350-metre-long and 75-metre-wide runway, which was opened for operations in April after a three-month long period of renovation could accommodate an Airbus A380.
I am happy that all misconceptions will be cleared after the landing of the Emirates A380 aircraft on Monday, helping Sri Lanka and the airport to achieve an aviation milestone. It proves that Sri Lanka now has a runway which could handle any aircraft in the world, the minister said.
The special one-off Emirates A380 flight EK654 from Dubai had 524 passengers on board.
The minister said Emirates officials had agreed to operate an A380 flight monthly initially from Dubai to Colombo . It will bring more tourists to the country and help develop the tourism industry as well, the minister said and added that several development projects had been launched at the BIA under the second phase.
He said the Mattala Airport would be developed to function as a popular airpovrt in the country with a project initiated with the Indian investors to bring aircraft to the MRIA.(Darshana Sanjeewa)

Floods kill 175  in India, Nepal and  Bangladesh
	

At least 175 people have died and thousands have fled their homes as monsoon floods swept across Nepal, India and Bangladesh, officials said Monday, warning the toll could rise as the extent of the damage becomes clear. 
Three days of relentless downpours sparked flash floods and landslides that have killed at least 80 people in Nepal, 73 across northern and eastern India and 22 in Bangladesh. 
Around 200,000 people are living in emergency camps in Assam in northeast India, which suffers frequent flooding during the annual monsoon rains. 
Another 15,000 have had to leave their homes in the eastern state of Bihar, which borders Nepal and where one official said seven rivers were at danger levels. 
All trains to the northeast have been suspended until Wednesday, with sections of the track completely submerged in water, Indian railway spokesman Anil Saxena told AFP. 
In Nepal, ariel photos taken by an AFP photographer showed huge swathes of land in the southeast still underwater Monday afternoon. 
Police said over 48,000 homes have been totally submerged by the floods across Nepals southern plains. 
As emergency workers struggled to reach far-flung areas, the countrys home ministry said another 36 people were missing, presumed dead, revising down an earlier count after more bodies were found. 
The Nepal Red Cross warned that shortages of safe drinking water and food could create a humanitarian crisis in the impoverished Himalayan country.

He wanted to hog the publicity
	
A deputy had invited a senior top team purohita to attend as the chief guest a ceremony organized to mark the unveiling of a monument put up in honour of his mother.
The purohita had readily accepted the invitation. However, after attending the ceremony, he had instructed the media institutions to black out the deputy completely from the footage covering the event and to show only the parts that featured him.
The instruction given by the senior purohita had surprised the media personnel not only because of the unusual nature of the instruction, but also because of the well-known fact that the deputy in question looks on this senior purohita as his mentor and political leader.

He expressed these views at an event held to unveil a Buddha statue at Sri Dharma Vijayaloka Maha Viharaya in Pannipitiya yesterday.
Even the Buddha was insulted during that time. There is no wonder that I also have to face insults and slander in this society, which is deteriorating due to commercialization, he said.
The President recalled that Mahathma Gandhi and Srimath S. W. R. D. Bandaranaike were also insulted.
He pointed out that today modern technology is used for disgracing people than using it for the gaining knowledge, social development or building a better society.
He said the young generation should be spiritually developed in order to save them from this harmful social condition.

IGP contemplates legal action against website
	
Police spokesman Ruwan Gunasekara said Police Chief Pujith Jayasundare was mulling legal action against a website that published defamatory remarks about him and a video clip depicting him threatening a minor employee of the Police department.
The video clip that went viral on social media websites took centre stage at the weekly Cabinet news briefing today.
The police spokesman tried his best to defend the Police Chief answering a barrage of questions from journalists.
He also said the IGP would be taking legal action against the website for distorting and publishing the visuals in a defamatory and malicious manner.
Journalist: Why did the IGP attack a lift operators without any provocation
SP: No, no, he never attacked him, only questioned him.
J: The video shows the IGP holding the employee by his collar and nearly hitting him. What prompted the IGP to do that
SP: The Police Headquarters has allocated a few minutes for meditation after the national anthem is sung and before starting our duties. This man has not done that.
J: For what purpose is meditation
SP: For mental tranquility and discipline
J: Does it apply to all those at the Police HQ
SP: Yes
J: In that case, is this the IGP maintains his mental tranquility and discipline
There is laughter at this response.
J: What is this story involving an incidence of sexual harassment of a receptionist
SP: I dont know really. Social media websites act in a malicious manner with vengeance. We are going to take legal action against this institution for defamation. There are 17 lawyers among police officers and they are reviewing this ugly episode and will take appropriate legal action.
J: A recent UN report has said police torture is widely prevalent in Sri Lankan police stations. This incident will reflect badly on Sri Lanka and vindicates what the UN report says.
SP: When the IGP was on his morning inspection round this employee was not there.
J: This minor employee has complained about other incidents of harassment against him also.
SP: I am not aware. There have been no complaints in this regard though he says so. (Sandun A Jayasekera)

Independent Commission bigwig abuses his official clout
	

There is an independent Commission set up under the Constitutional provisions to ensure that appointments, promotions, disciplinary action etc. of a department responsible for maintaining law and order in the country are done free from political or other interference. So naturally the general public expect this Commission to be manned by persons of unquestionable integrity and moral rectitude.

By the way, a certain bigwig of this Commission had entertained the bizarre idea of giving a training in the use of firearms to the members of his family. Being a person hailing from the Kalutara area he knew of a shooting gallery of a training college coming under the purview of the department he is officially concerned with.
Only the departmental personnel are allowed access to this shooting gallery. But the departmental authorities had gone out of the way to allow the family members of the Commission bigwig to conduct shooting practice at this gallery, they say.
Meanwhile, some departmental high-ups had complained to the authorities concerned about the misuse of the departmental shooting gallery causing inconvenience to its legitimate users. No action has been taken so far to stop the use of the facility by the outsiders. But the possible dismissal from service is staring in the face of the officials who made the complaint, they say.

This is a welcome sign that the drought of international cricket in Pakistan is finally ending. Thus, it is high time that the countrys largest city deserves to get at least one match in the upcoming series, said the mayor.
Karachis National Stadium hosted its last ODI and Test match against Sri Lanka in January and February of 2009 in the series which proved to be Pakistans last exposure to international cricket when the Sri Lankan team was attacked on the third day of the Lahore Test near Gaddafi Stadium in March.
The city mayor promised a foolproof security plan for players and officials by effectively engaging police and paramilitary Rangers if a match was awarded to the city.
He thanked the Sri Lanka cricket authorities for sending their players to Pakistan and pledged that the cricket-loving residents of Karachi would shower immense love on the visiting islanders, who, despite what happened in the past are helping us to revive the most popular sport in the country.
Once we host our Sri Lankan brothers, it will surely encourage other international teams to visit us in future.
He said Karachi had been a popular venue, which had witnessed several memorable and thrilling bouts in the past.
Our sportsmanship has been praised by the rest of the world, and it is an open secret that international players felt proud to play in Karachi.

Most Venerable Kotugoda Dhammawasa Uttaritara MahaNayaka Thera
	
Appointed head of the Amarapura Sect, with over 16,000 Bhikkus under its traditionof ordination 
Ever since the introduction of Buddhism to Sri Lanka 23 centuries ago,Buddhism has remained the defining force that has shaped the life and soul of the nation. And the country has been blessed with a lineage of great Theras who have not only guided the people along the Dhamma preached by the Buddha, but also as guardians of the nation. 
The newly inducted Uttaritara Mahanayaka Thera of the Amarapura Mahanikaya, the Most Venerable Agga Maha Pandita Kotugoda Dhammawasa Thera, with his noteworthy contribution to the protection, perpetuation and propagation of Buddhism, has been a towering figure in contemporary Buddhist history of Sri Lanka. Uttaritara Mahanayaka Thera, in keeping with a tradition dating back to the reign of Sinhalese kings, received his credentials from His Excellency President, Maithripala Sirisena, at a state ceremony held at Independence Square on August 3, 2017. 
The Most Venerable Thera was born on the 26th of January 1933 at Kotugoda, in Minuwangoda, to devoted Buddhist parents Endavitharanage Haramanis Rodrigo  a planter by profession and his wife Selestina Rodrigo. His lay name was Sirimevan. 
Young Sirimevan, who inherited the virtue of entering the Buddhist Order, was ordained as Kotugoda Dhammawasa, on the 17th of August 1948, at Sri Dharmapalarama Vihara, Galkissa, under the tutelage of Venerable Unavatune Dhammapala Thera. 
Dhammawasa, the Samanera Bhikku, received his early education at Paramadhamma Chetiya Pirivena, Ratmalana, and his higher education at Vidyodaya Pirivena, Maligakanda. He gained higher ordination in 1954. 
The hallmark of the Most Venerable Thera was the excellent delivery of Dhamma sermons in a distinctive style and expository skills that caught the attention of the audience. Consequently, the name of young Dhammawansa Thera began to rank amongst senior Bhikkus who were well known for Dhamma sermons at the time. Uttaritara Mahanayaka Thera is credited with the distinction of having delivered sermons over national radio for over 50 years. His sermons have also been widely attended by audiences overseas during his great efforts of propagating Buddhism in India, Nepal, China, Japan, Germany, USA, Russia, Singapore, Burma, Thailand, Pakistan and Mongolia. His efforts in spreading the Buddhas word outside Sri Lanka has resulted in the establishment of Buddhist temples overseas such as the Sri Lankarama in Burma and the Charumati Temple in Nepal. 
The Uttaritara Mahanayaka Thera has also been a prolific author, having published more than 36 books on various subjects related to Buddhism since the 1960s. 
In recognition of his services to the Buddhist Order as well as his brilliance as an erudite Buddhist scholar, the then 37-year-old Dhammawasa Thera was elected to the Executive Council of the Amarapura Chapter of the Amarapura Sect in 1970. He was appointed Anunayaka of the Amarapura Chapter in 1990 and Lekhakadhikari in 2001. In 2016, he became the Mahanayaka Thera of the chapter. The Thera has been honoured with numerous honorary titles in Sri Lanka and abroad. They include the Agga Maha Panditha Degree conferred by the Burmese Government, Mahopadhayaya title from the Amarapura Sangha Council, and the honorary titles Thripitaka Visharada, Prawachana Kirthi Sri Shasana Sobhana, Sri Sumangala Vidyawathansa, and Sri Sambuddha Sasana Dharmakathika Kirthidhara. 
Besides his pre-eminent service to the Buddhist Order, Dhammawasa Thera has also been a Guardian God of the Nation, strongly standing against any issue that went against the broader socio-cultural or national interests of the country. 
He was elected Uttararitara Mahanayaka Thera of the Amarapura Great Sect (which comprises all 22 Chapters of the Amarapura Sect, with over 16,000 Bhikkus under its tradition of ordination) in May this year, following the demise of his predecessor Most Venerable Agga Maha Panditha Davuldena Gnanissara Thera. 
Let us wish our Uttaritara Mahanayaka Thera good health and long life for continuation of his great services as a towering figure in the contemporary Buddhist Order of Sri Lanka. 
Sanath Panawennage.

Signs of an easing in tension on the Korean peninsula helped stock markets rally for a second day running even as the United States and South Korea prepared for more joint military drills, which infuriate the North, and experts warned it could still go ahead with its provocative plan.
In his first public appearance in about two weeks, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un inspected the command of the Norths army on Monday, examining a plan to fire four missiles to land near the U.S. Pacific territory of Guam, the official KCNA said in a report.
He said that if the Yankees persist in their extremely dangerous reckless actions on the Korean peninsula and in its vicinity, testing the self-restraint of the DPRK, the latter would make an important decision as it already declared, the report said.
The DPRK stands for North Koreas official name, the Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea.
In photos released with the KCNA report, Kim was seen holding a baton and pointing at a map showing a flight path for the missiles appearing to start from North Koreas east coast, flying over Japan towards Guam. North Korea has often threatened to attack the United States and its bases and released similar photos in the past but never followed through.

Necessity knows no law
	

The Buddhist Association of the yahapalanaya nerve centre had taken the initiative to conduct a religious programme and its office-bearers were putting the final touches to their arrangements when the white-collar high-ups of the place had taken over the task of holding the programme pushing those involved in organizing the event to the background.

These white-collar high-ups had forcibly taken over the responsibility of holding the religious programme in a bid to earn brownie points from a high political authority, they say.

No more holding noses and yelling garbage crisis!
	
Government introduces long-term, effective measures to address the nationwide crisis of waste management
Turning a new leaf in its wake, there seems to be a ray of hope for effective garbage management as the Government plans to introduce long-term measures to address the islandwide garbage crisis in a much organized manner. From the disastrous tragedy of the Meethotamulla garbage dump to the lack of a proper solid waste management plan and the environmental pollution caused, Sri Lanka has faced plenty of challenges in seeking solutions to address the garbage crisis. Therefore, its indeed glad tidings to hear that the Government has finally decided to take a firm stance on addressing the garbage issue with long-term measures, which reflects on brighter prospects with regard to solid waste management.
Areas are maintained and theres no piling of garbage as before

- Colombo Municipal Council (CMC) Commissioner
V.K.A. Anura
The Municipality along with the assistance of the Environmental Police and the Army is playing a proactive role in ensuring that waste disposal is carried out smoothly in the suburbs

Speaking tothe Daily Mirror, Colombo Municipal Council (CMC) Commissioner V.K.A. Anura said that the CMC will be signing an agreement with the Western Power Company on September 14 this year, as a step forward in addressing the garbage issue more effectively in the future. According to the agreement, the company which is expected to receive 700 tons of garbage on a daily basis will be responsible for carrying out a project where the accumulated garbage will be used for the production of long-term power generation. In addition to this project, that is currently under way, the Municipality along with the assistance of the Environmental Police and the Army is playing a proactive role in ensuring that waste disposal is carried out smoothly in the suburbs. If you look around the Colombo suburbs, you would have noticed that most areas are maintained clean and there isnt piling up of garbage as before. We have also initiated several community based awareness programmes to raise more awareness on the need for garbage management and its proper disposal. The public will also have to play a cooperative role to help mitigate this problem, he added. 
Stringent, long-term measures for effective waste management

Media Secretary of Ministry of Megapolis and Western Development,
Dhanushka Ramanayake
Here we discuss the tasks they have carried out within the day. This includes an update on the amount of garbage collected and disposed within the day, the number of lorries that were dispatched to collect garbage daily

When inquired about the governments future plans for long-term waste management, Media Secretary of Ministry of Megapolis and Western Development Dhanushka Ramanayake said that since the official responsibility of addressing the problem of garbage management was entrusted to them recently, the Ministry has taken a firm stand with regard to the implementation of a number of initiatives for a positive progress on the said subject. There were heaps of garbage piled up at different locations within Colombo. The responsibility of collecting and disposing of garbage within Colombo city limits rests with the Colombo Municipality along with Abans and Carekleen.
As a foremost step, we instructed them to ensure that the piled up garbage in Colombo suburbs should be immediately removed within a period of four days. Since July 6, we call a meeting at 7.00 p.m. at the CMC premises daily with the participation of senior officials of the Municipality, Police OICs, the environment police, Public Health Inspectors, engineers and representatives from Abans and Carekleen. Here we discuss the tasks they have carried out within the day. This includes an update on the amount of garbage collected and disposed within the day, the number of lorries that were dispatched to collect garbage daily, how many individuals were fined for illegal disposal of garbage and an update on the number of cases filed due to such misconduct on a daily basis Ramanayake said.
According to him, officials representing the Environmental Protection Unit of the tri forces have been deployed in selected areas, to monitor the situation closely on a daily basis. Its their duty to take pictures of the condition of regular garbage dumping sites within Colombo between the hours of 4.00 a.m - 6.00 a.m in the morning, everyday. A similar routine of taking photographs of the same sites during the evening hours between 3.00  5.00 p.m. will be carried out by these officials. This helps in keeping track of whether the waste accumulated within the day was removed or not by garbage collectors. The progress of collecting garbage is thus monitored very closely in all areas within the Colombo suburb. In any case, if the daily waste isnt collected by the garbage collectors, the surveillance officer in charge will take measures to send a multi media message or a message via the Whatsup or Viber social apps to the relevant authority in the area responsible for garbage collection, along with a picture of the piled up garbage site immediately.
This is done as a means of alerting them of the current situation. However, this initiative has been expanded further, beyond the city limits of Colombo. In addition to the areas in Colombo, these measures are also carried out in Dehiwela, Mt. Lavinia, Moratuwa, from Negombo Road to Kelaniya Municipality, Kotte, Kaduwela and Kolonnawa. Except for the garbage that gets accumulated on a daily basis, measures have also been taken to ensure that the garbage doesnt get piled up anywhere for days. 
Construction work for two waste-to-power plants commenced at Muthurajawela under the patronage of President Maithripala Sirisena
Arrangements have been made for the display of a notice board in every collecting point, apartment area and in villages, specifying the days when garbage is collected, how the garbage should be segregated and disposed according to the days and the time schedule linked with garbage collection in the respective areas. A hotline is made available for public complaints or suggestions; especially if the garbage collectors fail to turn up for waste collection at any location. It should be noted that Abans or Carekleen will be fined a maximum of Rs. 100,000 for a day, if the garbage isnt collected from any given area they are assigned with. We have also initiated a plan to ensure that the garbage collection, that falls under the direct purview of the Colombo Municipality, runs smoothly, he said. As a means of ensuring this, he said that a Key Performance Indicator will be introduced soon to monitor Government officials of the Colombo Municipality. Further career opportunities, salary increments and promotions for such officers will be determined based upon this indicator. 
We have already repaired the garbage collecting tractors and lorries in order to offer a much effective service. This initiative also included the attachment of a GPS tracking system and a colour wash for the vehicles. Moreover, there are certain locations in Colombo where objects wrought of iron are simply dumped. These objects mostly include broken remnants of three wheelers and lorries and other vehicles. In most cases there is no one to claim them. A notice was issued by the Colombo Municipality to houses around such locations, requesting to collect their objects within a period of fourteen days. In the event no one comes forward to claim their properties, these objects will be moved over to another location by us, he added. 
As a foremost step, we instructed them to ensure that the piled up garbage in Colombo suburbs should be immediately removed
	Officials representing the Environmental Protection Unit of the tri forces have been deployed in selected areas
	The progress of collecting garbage is thus monitored very closely in all areas within the Colombo suburb
	Arrangements have been made for the display of a notice board in every collecting point
Energy from WasteA key step forward inwaste management
According to a recent press release issued by the Ministry of Megapolis and Western Development, modern techniques including recycling methods-on par with developed countries- will be employed in the process of handling waste management. The employing of such techniques will be done by giving equal priority to how best recycling of waste can be made use of and how environment friendly, the disposal process is going to be. Keeping focus on this method, the Government has recognized Sanitary Landfilling System as a long term solution for garbage management in the future. A location in Aruwakkalu, Puttaam has been chosen for this purpose.
The sanitary landfills will be carried out in pits that were left abandoned following its excavation of limestone for cement production. The feasibility study and Environmental Impact Assessment for the project have already been completed in this regard. While setting the background for this project is currently under way, it should also be noted that the Ministry has taken the initiation to introduce a project aimed at producing energy from waste. We had an international competitive bidding for the Waste to Energy programme. Out of the 194 bidders who applied for bidding, we have selected three technically, financially and socially viable investors and Muthurajawela and Karadiyana have been selected as the ideal locations for the project.
Keeping focus on this method, the Government has recognized Sanitary Landfilling System as a long term solution for garbage management in the future. A location in Aruwakkalu, Puttaam has been chosen for this purpose
We have already kick started the construction work for two waste-to-power plants at Muthurajawela under the patronage of President Maithripala Sirisena. These waste-to-power plants officially commenced on August 10. Megapolis and Western Development Minister Champika Ranawaka and several ministers participated at the inauguration of this event. The next project is scheduled be held in Karadiyana on August 17, this week Ramanayaka added. 
KHCT Lanka Jang and Western Power have been recognized as the two main companies that would invest on the programme. According to the agreement signed between the Waste Management Authority of the Western Province and KHCT Lanka Jang, the company is expected to receive 700 tons of solid waste on a daily basis from the Authority. Meanwhile, the Colombo Municipal Council will be responsible in making arrangements for the Western Power Company to obtain solid waste from them. A capacity of 10 Megawatts is to be produced by each company by means of waste, which will be connected to the National Grid eventually. Therefore, an overall aggregate of 20 Megawatts of power production is expected from both companies, which will be contributed to the National Grid. 
The project, commenced with a total investment of 27 billion rupees, is expected to conclude its construction work within a span of twenty four months. The successful completion of the project would create the ideal platform for a better and viable solution to battle the challenges of waste management whilst easing the nation of its burden faced by garbage mismanagement, environment pollution and the health risks associated with it.

No threat to national security: Army Commander
	
Army Commander Lieutenant General Mahesh Senanayake said yesterday that despite several incidents being reported from the Northern Province, those incidents were not a threat to national security.
The Army Commander while replying to a question raised by a journalist at a press Conference held in Colombo, that there are around 200 ex-LTTE members who had not been rehabilitated in the Northern Province, stated that those ex-LTTE members were not involved in the recent attacks.
He said after the war ended, 12,190 ex-LTTE members had been rehabilitated and 1,963 of them were from Jaffna. He said some 200 ex-LTTE members might have not rehabilitated for several reason.
"Only one ex-LTTE member involved in an incident in Jaffna where a police constable attached to the security detail of the Jaffna High Court Judge, was shot dead recently" he said.
The Army commander asserted that none of the ex-LTTE members were involved in the activities of the north-based 'Awa' group.
"Though small incident occurred in the North, all are trying to create a big issue out of it. But when similar crimes and incidents happened in other parts of the country, no one is talking about them. I assure you that there is no threat to the national security," Lieutenant General Mahesh Senanayake said.
He said, to curb such crimes in the North, the Police had a major duty which they are already doing at the moment. "It is a relief for Sri Lanka Army if police are able to contain those incidents," the Commander said. (Darshana Sanjeewa)

Not in a position to dissolve the Cricket Board: Sports Minister
	
While admitting that the Sri Lanka Cricket Team is in its lowest ebb in mental and physical toughness and technical abilities, Minister of Sports Dayasiri Jayasekara today said that this was the best possible team available at the moment.
Addressing the weekly Cabinet news briefing, Minister Jayasekara said he has called reports from the physiotherapist, coach, doctor, bowling and fielding coaches to have an idea as to what and where it went wrong to suffer the most humiliating defeat in the history of Sri Lankan cricket at the hands of India in the recently concluded Test series.
We must help the team. If anyone can propose a team or a cricketer better than those in the current Test Cricket Team please go ahead. I have no hesitation to bring him to the National Team if anyone can name a better bowler or a batsman. However, I dont want to intervene in team selection or other affairs of cricket than necessary because the media will target me even for that, Minister Jayasekara added.
Minister Jayasekara said he had a two hour discussion with the team and administration on Tuesday and will individually speak with the cricketers after the ODI series is concluded.
I am not in a position to dissolve the Cricket Board only because our National Cricket Team gets a bashing from India. I cant also appoint an Interim Committee as suggested by Minister Arjuna Ranatunga because it is not the correct thing to do. Dont forget that Mr. Ranarunga was beaten at the last Cricket Board Elections, Minister Jayasekara said.
Minister Jayasekara said all past senior cricketers and captains have given a pledge to him that they would provide their fullest support and cooperation to rebuild the Sri Lanka Test, ODI and T20 Teams into a winning combination. (Sandun A. Jayasekera)

PCoI asks W. M. Mendis & Co. Ltd. to provide account details immediately
	
The PCoI today overruled the objections raised by Counsel who appeared for W.M. Mendis Company and asked them to comply with the directive and submit the relevant financial details within the day.
Presidents Counsel Anuja Premaratne appearing for Perpetual Capital Holdings CEO Arjun Aloysius said yesterday he would also appear on behalf of W.M. Mendis Company's CEO.
Initially, Mr. Premaratne was of the view that they were in the process of asking the banks for the details required by the Commission regarding the company's balance sheets since 2014, details of the bank accounts of the Company and the bank statements since 2014.
He said the PCoI had no mandate to ask for the financial details of W.M. Mendis Company on the basis that it has no reference with the incidental matters inquired by the PCoI.
However, Additional Solicitor General Dappula de Livera said the PCoI has the mandate to call for any particulars with regard to the disposal of profits earned through treasury bonds dealt by PTL and hence the transfer of profits to W.M. Mendis & Company from PTL is within the disposal process and therefore under the PCoI's mandate.
Deputy Solicitor General Milinda Gunathilake said there were some profit transfers from PTL to W.M. Mendis & Co. Ltd., visible in documents provided by PTL CEO Kasun Palisena.
Justice Prasanna Jayawardena was of the view that any of the required details would be available with the company's accounts department and asked the counsel to provide them to the Commission immediately.
PCoI Chairman Justice K.T. Chitrasiri emphasized that in any event W.M. Mendis & Co. Ltd., should submit the required details complying with the previous order within the day. Otherwise we have to make our own inferences because you have been given enough time to provide them, Justice Chitrasiri said.
The PCoI said it would consider the legal argument raised by PC Premaratne on the commission's mandate and give an order today but in the meantime W.M. Mendis & Co. Ltd., should provide the required details. (Shehan Chamika Silva)

Phone recording system does not record time and incoming numbers: PTL CEO
	
Perpetual Treasuries Ltd CEO Kasun Palisena said today the phone recording system placed in the company dealers' room did not record the time or incoming call numbers and as such he was unable to provide the required PTL dealers phone conversations regarding specific bond transactions.
The PCoI also asked him why he did not submit answers in an affidavit as required by the it earlier.
However, in the absence of his legal representative the witness said he was prepared to provide answers on PTL's phone recording system as he had examined the recording system set up in the dealing room by himself prior to giving evidence today.
Additional Solicitor Genaral Dappula de Livera was of the view that the witness, as the CEO of PTL, should have a good knowledge about the recording system. The ASG said he only wanted to know whether the witness can say that PTLs phone recording system reflected the times and calling numbers.
The witness said there were only serial numbers visible in the computer system with regard to the phone conversations and the system did not provide the times or incoming phone numbers.
However, during this query, ASG Livera warned the witness over his tone of voice when answering the questions put to him by the ASG.
However, intervening on the matter Justice Prasanna Jayawardena questioned the witness.
Justice Jayawardena: You are giving evidence under oath, so you know what happens if you give false evidence.
W: Yes
J: Did you give all the call recordings
W: Yes I did
J: Have you looked at the computer system of the phone recording system
W: I checked it personally this morning
J: So everything in the dealer room at PTL is recorded
W: Yes
J: Is the time recorded in the system
W: No
J: Is the call number recorded
W: Not recorded
When questioned by Justice Jayawardena, the witness said PTLs phone recording system was set up by the Metropolitan Company.
J: Have you ever modified the system
W: No
J: Therefore Metropolitan should know the system's capability
W: Yes
J: Was it a customized system
W: I need to check on that
J: Once again that would also be known by Metropolitan
In the meantime, Perpetual Treasuries Ltd concluded the evidence of CEO Kasun Palisena. Presidents Counsel Nihal Fernando said yesterday he would call PTLs back office manager Manju Priyadarshan to the commission to testify on certain technical matters. (Shehan Chamika Silva)

PTL CEO unaware as to what happened to Rs.712 mn paid to PAM as dividends
	
When questioned by Justice Prasanna Jayawardena at the PCoI today, PTL CEO Kasun Palisena said he was unaware as to what happened to the dividends amounting to Rs.712 million paid by PTL to its 100% shareholding company Perpetual Asset Management Limited though he himself was also a non-executive director of that company.
Mr. Palisena submitted to the Presidential Commission of Inquiry (PCoI) the declaration of dividends with regard to the PTL and its share holding companies and explained the ownership structure, under which PTL operated.
It was explained that the dividends paid by PTL to its shareholders out of its profits, was generally paid to the 100% shareholder of the Company.
It was explained that Perpetual Capital Holdings was one time a 100% shareholder of Perpetual Treasuries Ltd while its current shareholder is Perpetual Asset Management Limited.
Justice Prasanna Jayawardena: Who owns Perpetual Asset Management
Witness Palisena: Perpetual Capital Holdings
J: Who owns Perpetual Capital Holdings
W: Perpetual Capital Pvt Ltd
J: And who owns Perpetual Capital Pvt Ltd
W: Arjun Aloysius and Geoffrey Aloysius
When Presidents Counsel Nihal Fernando appearing for Perpetual Treasuries Ltd said there were changes in the ownership, Justice Jayawardena was of the view that he had never seen such a model of change in the ownership of the Companies.
J: Be that as it may, these dividends paid by PTL to its immediate holding company amounts to Rs.712 million
W: Yes
J: What happened to that money That money was paid in cash so what happened to it thereafter
W: That you might have to ask from the Company
J: Are you saying that you dont know
W: I can check and tell
J: Surely as the PTL CEO you paid dividends to your shareholder, so you should have known what they did with that money right
While Justice Prasanna Jayawardena was questioning the witness, the Counsel appearing for PTL, were attempting to comment on some questions that Justice Jayawardena put to the witness. Then Justice Jayawardena cautioned them not to comment about those questions and maintain silence when he questioned the witness.
J: So, you would not know what happened to that money
W: I would not know what happened to that money
At this point PCoI Chairman Justice K. T. Chitrasiri asked the witness whether he was currently a non-executive director of Perpetual Asset Management Limited.
Justice Chitrasiri was of the view that as a director of PTL's share holding company and while attending its board meetings he should have known about it.
The witness said he was only appointed as a director after February 2016. However, Justice Jayawardena confirmed that the dividends were paid after February 2016 to Perpetual Asset Management (100% share holding company of PTL).
Justice Jayawardena: Any director would know what happened to that sort of money, so you can tell us what happened to it, where that money went when you come back to the commission today.
Justice Jayawardena said the Commission would appreciate if the witness could assist the inquiry by providing what exactly happened to that money or else the Commission would have to do a search of the audited accounts.
J: I am telling this seriously and dont want it disregarded, otherwise we will hold you responsible to that.
The witness finally agreed to provide what has been asked by the Commission when he comes back today. (Shehan Chamika Silva)

Rathupaswala victims want bigwigs brought  to book
	
Commemorating the past is great if it brings sweet memories, but not if it brings dark moments like the Rathupaswala incident. The shooting at innocent civilians in Rathupaswala took place on August 01, 2013. People have spent a four-year wait awaiting justice. 
The incident put a black mark on Sri Lankas history because it defamed the much adored Sri Lankan Army. The protesting public was shot at and were injured. Loved ones were lost, but a battle was won. When people in power do nothing to solve the severe problems faced by the public, they themselves stand up against the violation of their basic human rights. The legal proceedings regarding the incident began in court after many years. Court proceedings have been slow. 
The CID noticed the courts on August 9 that some evidence related to the shooting scene had been destroyed
	As many as 30 were injured. Some were disabled as a result of the shooting
	The Police, Divisional Secretariesand local politicians werent involved insolving the issue
Army officers involved in the Rathupaswala incident in 2013 were arrested by the CID and produced in Gampaha Magistrate Court on March 24, 2017. The hearing continued till April 07 and the accused were remanded till the next hearing, which took place on April 26. The case was taken up again on May 03 and May 17 and the CID informed the courts to obtain the testimonies of the Judicial Medical Officers (JMO) who conducted the postmortem of the deceased. On May 17 the hearing was postponed to May 31. Meanwhile, the CID questioned the victims- who were attacked- again and searched for remaining bullets from the scene of shooting. 
When people in power do nothing to solve the severe problems faced by the public, they themselves stand up against the violation of their basic human rights
The period of remand for Brigadier Anura Deshapriya Gunawardena and the three others arrested were extended from June 14 to June 28 and then again to July 12 by the Chief Magistrate D.A Ruwan Pathirana at Gampaha Magistrate Court. Brigadier Deshapriya was arrested on May 25 by the CID for ordering the shooting of unarmed civilians who protested at Rathupaswala. 
The CID noticed the courts on August 9 that some evidence related to the shooting scene had been destroyed due to the neglect of then Gampaha Police Commissioner Ranjith Masinghe. The next hearing is scheduled for August 23. 
As those responsible didnt care to solve the water crisis, they (Villagers) themselves took the initiative to obtaina solution
The weapons possessed by the three suspects have matched the description of the bullets found at the scene of the crime. Its questionable how only three soldiers were arrested when there were more than 200 armed security personnel engaged in the shooting. The two people shot dead were students and they were identified as K.A.D. Akila Dinesh (17) and H.S. Ravishan Perera (18). The other victim, 29-year-old Nilantha Pushpakumara, died due to a blow on the head where his assailants had used a blunt weapon. As many as 30 were injured. Some were disabled as a result of the shooting while private and public property was also damaged. 
The protest was held with the hope of obtaining a solution to the issue regarding drinking water in the area. The villagers were protesting because a factory in the area was releasing harmful chemical filled waste-water into paddy fields. The fields- situated in the proximity of the factory premises- became unsafe for agriculture. The villagers experienced severe problems regarding drinking water. This happened because the PH levels in the water exceeded the specified healthy limit. The Police, Divisional Secretaries and local politicians werent involved in solving the issue.
As those responsible didnt care to solve the water crisis, they (Villagers) themselves took the initiative to obtain a solution. Residents of Rathupaswala, Weliweriya, Nedungamuwa and those living in adjoining villagers held peaceful protests where over 5000 protesters participated. The protests continued until they were attacked by the army troops-commanded by Brigadier Deshapriya Gunawardena-on August 01. The villagers, who ran for their lives, were chased, attacked and fired at. Many were injured. The remanded security personnel were accused of murder, attempting murder and severely injuring people according to sentences 300 and 296 of the Sri Lankan Penal Code. 
I tried to stop the shooting- 
Melan Perera Retired Army sergeant in Weliweriya
I was given seven hundred and fifty thousand rupees on April 08, 2016 as compensation. But nobody can undo the things that happened to me and others. I cant accuse the army or the police even though its true that I acted on behalf of the villagers in their struggle during the incident. They gave me what they promised. The former Government gave one million rupees for every dead person and balanced it somehow, he said. 
Many people are afraid to speak out. I am a former Army Sergeant and I tried to stop the shooting during the incident. I turned away some soldiers advising them not to shoot
Many people are afraid to speak out. I am a former Army Sergeant and I tried to stop the shooting during the incident. I turned away some soldiers advising them not to shoot. Some of them shot me too. Unfortunately, the bullet meant to hit my knee struck my right hip bone because I bent down to protect myself. While I was in hospital for four months my three wheeler was seized by the leasing company. Anyway, I had to mortgage my wifes jewellery to save it. And after that the monies I received as compensation were used to bail out the my guarantors who were jailed. 
I am now 48 years old and they have recommended a hip plate that can be used for a period of 15 years. But I am unable to replace it in the future due to the financial state I am in,he said.
An attacked family tells their tale
Preethika Nilanthi, Rohan Patrick and their three sons who were in the thick of things at Weliweriya
We were told to request for compensation, but we were unable to do so because we didnt have medical reports to prove the damages to us during the attack carried out by the army inside the church. My husband had a severe headache for around three months due to blows to his head with a baton. He couldnt work for some time. Meanwhile, we survived with our sisters help. My sons right arm was cracked in three places because he tried to save his younger brother, aged 9. Our three sons and two sisters were also there and all of us were attacked. 
There were over 70 armed men engaged in the shooting at the church. But why are they punishing only four of them We request justice from the responsible people to punish the guilty, Prithika and her husband opined.

When the Daily Mirror checked the houses of the two students who died in the attack, it seemed that many people were attacked had left the area. 
Rathupaswala villagers were first fighting for their right to have clean water and now they are waiting for justice. It seems they will have to wait a lifetime. 
CID Special Branch OIC Chief Inspector Ranjith Munasinghe and Sub Inspector Upali Bandara are carrying out investigations following instructions of ASP B.S. Thissera, Deputy Director SSP Shani Abeysekera, under the guidance of CID Director Sudath Nagahamulla and the DIG Ravi Senevirathna. 
Punish all who participated in the shooting and those who ordered the shooting
- Suresh Perera Chief organizer of Siyane Environment Conservation Association
A prominent individual among the protests who initiated the protests from the beginning, Suresh Perera, emphasized on the present situation regarding the supply of water to the villagers. The Water Board doesnt provide enough water for everybody to fulfil their needs. Even the Water Board itself has admitted that 28 areas coming under the purview of the Grama Niladhari Administration have been destroyed due to the water being polluted. 
Colonel Solangarachchi first began attacking with a baton and soon the shooting followed. It wasnt just one shot, complete magazines were used to shoot at poor civilians who were requesting for pure water. Three people died and a lot more were injured. The shooting continued till midnight. The helpless people, who ran for mercy to the church, were also attacked, he said.

Its said that the villagers had several dialogues with Gotabaya Rajapaksa to solve the problem. However a political bigwig didnt want Rajapaksa to solve the issue fearing he will gain political mileage. Brigadier Deshapriya Gunawardena came here without a request from anybody and his sole purpose was to attack people. He was there from the beginning. The Geneva reports have given directions to punish those guilty. But the government hasnt punished them yet. 
Even the Central Environment Authority doesnt admit that the pollution of water was caused by this. They are bound to find out what happened here and provide solutions. Individuals holding high positions in government institutions are responsible for the destruction that takes place in the country. The nitrate level recorded in the water is more than 197%, when the permitted amount is 10%. The CEA should find out how this happened. 
The factory was completely shifted by February 2014. We were offered compensation on April 08, 2016. We think we were compensated fairly, Suresh noted. 
We request the authorities to punish the persons who ordered the shooting to the ones involved in the shooting to ensure that this kind of thing doesnt happen again. Its now more than three years. Its only now that they have remanded the shooters, he said.

SAITM controversy: Lalkantha wants PCoI to probe Rajitha
	
Provincial councillor K.D. Lalkantha today urged the government to appoint a commission similar to that of the Presidential Commission of Inquiry (PCoI) on the CB bond issue to investigate Minister Rajitha Senaratne in connection with the SAITM controversy.
He told a news conference that he had valid suspicions that several politicians had been paid by SAITM owner.
It is necessary to set up such a commission to probe these matters. Instead of establishing a special court to probe corruption, a special court should be set up against these ministers, Lalkantha said.
Commenting on the SAITM controversy, he said that instead of understanding the gravity of this matter, the government was attempting to make the anti-SAITM groups apply pressure on the government.
Mr. Lalkantha said the SAITM Virodhee Jana Pawra would continue its battle until they succeeded and added that the government should take the responsibility of the consequences.
About 7,000 university students have not attended their lectures especially in the medical faculties for months over this matter. All state university students have been affected by this SAITM issue. However, the relevant authorities are maintaining silence, he said. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)

Samurdhi report rejected; another being prepared: SB
	
The report on 2.3 million Samurdhi recipients had been rejected after a meeting held at the ministry today, Social Welfare Minister S.B. Dissanayake said.
He said the ministry was collecting information on Samurdhi recipients, who were entitled to receive Samurdhi benefits.
It was a 17-page questionnaire. It included six main criteria and 29 sub criteria. All collected data had to be digitized. During the process of digitizing the data, some pages had been omitted and some files had gone missing, he said.
After the report was published, the Ministry received several complaints that the Samurdhi recipients, really entitled to receive such benefits, had been left out. Even President Maithripala Sirisena had instructed that justice should be meted out to the genuine Samurdhi recipients.
The Ministry has instructed the District Secretariats to re-enter the data properly and include the names of all Samurdhi recipients, who are really need Samurdhi benefits, the Minister said.
Meanwhile, the Cabinet Sub Committee appointed by the President said the public had been misled by false media reports saying that Samurdhi allowance of some beneficiaries had been suspended. (Chaturanga Pradeep)

Son refuses to climb the greasy pole
	

A recent news story said a scion of a well-known political family was being groomed for a role in national politics by his illustrious mother. Taking a cue from this story, a party leader hailing from a political family in the upcountry estate sector too has made a bid to bring his son to the national political scene.

This politico leading the cockerels has asked his young son fresh from the kingdom with a law degree to get ready to make his debut on the political stage.
However, the son had given a firm no saying he was not prepared to climb the dirty grease pole.
The politico who had long planned to hand over his leadership mantle to his son in due course, just as he inherited it from his grandfather, is a highly disappointed man these days, they say.

Taylor Swift vows to donate to sexual  abuse victims
	
DAILY MAIL, 15 August, 2017 - An eight-member jury has sided with Taylor Swift in her counter suit against a fired radio DJ in Denver who is now forced to pay the singer a symbolic $1 after groping her four years ago. 
The pop singer accused former radio host David Mueller of groping her during a meet-and-greet photo session in June 2013 at the Pepsi Center.  After nearly four hours of deliberating, the jury, comprised of six women and two men, ruled in favor of Swift. 
Mueller will be required to pay $1 in damages to the 27-year-old songstress. 
The verdict came after the 27-year-old singer cried in court on Monday as Muellers lawyer claimed in his closing argument that a photo proved the former DJ wouldnt have been able to put his hand under her skirt.

They refuse to board a sinking ship
	

The JO stalwart from Rajarata Chandra clan who was hardly heard of after being shorn of his purohita status has become a busy body in the political scene these days, they say.

This worthy only a Diyawanna backbencher now has often been seen holding hush-hush talks with JO colleagues in the council singly or in groups.
By the way, there is a rumour that the man is on a special assignment given by no lesser person than a high title-holder of the Betel party from Ruhuna to woo the support of his colleagues for the new Blue leadership to form a government of their own.
The rumour also says that he has undertaken this assignment inspired by a promise given to provide instant solutions to some of the personal problems he is plagued with.
Meanwhile, the Rajarata man has begun receiving a hostile reception from a section of his colleagues who have given a firm no to the cause he is promoting saying they are not so stupid as to get on board a sinking ship.
