A typical worker?s lunch ahead of the Workers? Day!
	
?
A purohita who attended his Ministry after the National New Year vacation had to make do with a piece of bread with parippu curry for his lunch.
?
The purohita who called at his Ministry at noon after participating an official conference had felt terribly hungry. However, he soon learnt that there was no place for him to go for his lunch as all hotels and restaurants in the city were closed for the New Year holidays.?
One of his office aides who had looked high and low for a restaurant or a caf? reported that only a pavement ?kade? (eatery) opposite the Ministry was open at the time. ?But they have got only some roast bread pieces and parippu curry!?
?Bring whatever they have got. I am so hungry roast bread with parippu is quite okay!? the purohita had told his aide.

## Title: ?Aloko Udapadi?  The light THAT (ALMOST) AROSE

?Aloko Udapadi?  The light THAT (ALMOST) AROSE
	
Uddika Premaratne, I?ve always felt, was born to play the down-on-his-luck defeatist. I first saw him in a Poya day TV serial years ago. I don?t remember who directed or scripted it, but I remember Uddika. Clearly. He was a cancer patient, having just received news of his imminent death, trying to make amends with his estranged girlfriend and those other acquaintances who misunderstood him, spurned him, and eventually cast him aside. To say the least, I was impressed. ?
I didn?t know his name at the time, but when I saw those eyes of his (for his most characteristic feature is his eyes: half-shut, almost willingly yielding to fate), I thought I?d seen the very personification of dukha and all its religious and secular connotations. Like Dreyer?s Joan of Arc, he suffers and he endures with his face. He is no hero: as his later performances show (even in as quirky a movie as Samanala Sandwaniya), the most he can be is a wearied fighter. Which is why, when he was transformed by some of our directors to a king or a warrior, I was disenchanted. ?
The issue with Aloko Udapadi is that Uddika plays out such a king and warrior. Again. This issue, problematic as it is for me, is compensated for by having him act out a defeated king. When we see him as Valagamba for the first time, therefore, we realise that not only is he a leader who?s soon to be thrown out by enemies from abroad, but also that he is mildly defeatist and needs to assert himself loudly and brashly to compensate for his personal inhibitions. ?
The reign of Valagamba, with its many splits and rifts, not to mention schisms in the religious order, is second to that of Dutugemunu with respect to cinematic value. Jayantha Chandrasiri went ahead with the latter through Maharaja Gemunu. Now we have the son of an established epic moviemaker, Chathra Weeraman, direct the story of Valagamba, with all those splits and rifts, for what I consider as our film industry?s first real attempt at merging religious boundaries and blockbuster values. That doesn?t make it a superior movie (it?s anything but), but as a writer I am willing to give Chathra the benefit of the doubt. So here goes. ?
It?s true that Aloko Udapadi is, as one review makes it aptly clear, terribly unsubtle. If one is to lambast the script or handling of the players over that, however, one must go back to the original story, because in Valagamba, more so than even Dutugemunu, we come across a man who belongs by default to the realm of the larger-than-life. Since we know his story, we know how it will end. But since the demerits of the movie in that regard have been sketched out elsewhere, I won?t bother much with them. On the other hand, those demerits stab an otherwise promising epic. That troubles me. ?
Make no mistake, though, Chathra knows how to compose. His framing, his camerawork, his father?s script (which explains the at times hysterical dialogues and monologues), and his handling of players and locations, all deserve more than a customary clap. Because the plot depends so much on a dignified representation of Buddhism, moreover, he?s resorted to an impressionistic depiction of the Buddhist order: the movie is filled with wide shots of monks reclining in forest monasteries, interspersed with religious chanting highlighting the inevitability of suffering. Visually, then, Aloko Udapadi is a treat. ?
"To lambast the entire production of Aloko Udapadi as symptomatic of the recent trend in our cinema towards Sinhala Buddhist monoliths, consequently, shows how bankrupt we are"
To a considerable extent, this was supplemented by the acting. I have already pointed at Uddika, who despite his incongruent figure does retain some conviction as a warrior. The rest of the cast, while not exceptionally appealing, nevertheless moved me as much, sometimes even more. ?
Roshan Ravindra as one of the Five Chola Emperors (Pilayamara), for instance, intrigued me to such an extent that I wished he were more easy-to-categorise. But no, I realised as he hankered after more power by getting the other Emperors to make him their Don Juan and then fell from their favour: Ravindra, unlike Uddika, was not meant to play easy-to-categorise characters. He frowns so hard that he looks as though he?s refusing to reveal his feelings or what he?s planning to do next. ?
Then there was Dharshan Dharmaraj as Dathika, another of the Five Emperors. Dharshan usually brings to his characters a blend of hot-temperedness and naivet? (think of his performance in Machang), but here he isn?t as complex: in one scene, which might have been an unfortunate afterthought of the director or scriptwriter, he actually twirls his moustache after betraying Pilayamara and revealing that the latter?s courtesan was on his side. It?s as though Dharshan is channelling those villains from South Indian movies, who are endowed with a psychotic face (head down, eyes staring into the camera) and a convenient moustache. Whatever for, I wonder. ?
That latter point, by the way, sums up my disappointment with the second half of the movie. When the first half was done, I knew that the central conflict in the story ? between the prohibition against violence in Buddhism and the necessity of protecting the sasanaya by subverting that precept ? would only add more colour and complexity. Imagine my disappointment when, instead of using it to flesh out the plot, that conflict was used instead to depict a rather black-and-white simplification of the campaign to protect the Buddhist order. ?
Such a simplification, to the best of my limited understanding of our history and of world history in general, does a great disservice to the reality being simplified. We know, for instance, that Valagamba?s story did not end (as it does here) with his order that our oral history be inscribed on Ola leaves (the single biggest accomplishment of his reign, Buddhist scholars will contend): rather, it continued on to the biggest schism in our Buddhist order. He was not a model ruler or for that matter warrior: no less a historical text than the Mahavamsa notes that owing to various personal rifts with his Ministers, he actually left the campaign to regain his throne, thus weakening his army. ?
The problem with monolithic productions, especially in Sri Lanka and more particularly with respect to the recent spate of historic epics here, is that they?re terribly predictable. Simplifying history, and doing away with all its shades and tones of grey, makes them even more predictable. Even in a technically competent movie like Aloko Udapadi, with its spare but overwhelming use of visual effects, that sense of predictability chops off its greater merits. ?
Yes, we know Valagamba will return. We know Dathika will be routed. We know that those wide landscapes will be used for the anthima vijayagrahani satana. We know that conniving courtesan to Pilayamara and Dathika will get her just deserts. We know that when Valagamba rises, time will slow down to such an extent that the entire battle will resemble something the Wachowski Brothers could have perfected with some more CGI. We know that Dathika, after fighting with those other Sinhalese warriors, will wade his way through them like he?s in a jungle when he sees Valagamba. And we know that when the battle ends, it will start to rain. ?
And yet, strangely enough, I am not disappointed. What more can we expect, given our (understandable) fixation with the past? As a friend of mine, Sidath Gajanayaka, told me the other day, South Korea more or less made use of lesser, trivial epics to popularise their country, culture, and movie industry with the Korean Wave. ?That was well orchestrated propaganda,? Sidath told me, adding, ?We have richer stories, we do nothing with them.? What he implied there was that our epics offer a bigger canvas, fuelling not just the box-office but critical appeal as well. I agree. ?
To lambast the entire production of Aloko Udapadi as symptomatic of the recent trend in our cinema towards Sinhala Buddhist monoliths, consequently, shows how bankrupt we are. The fact that even Ranjan Ramanayake?s Maya compelled serious critical discussions by our postmodernist pundits shows that our industry no longer subsists on that fine line between populism and artiness. ?
I am not of course calling Aloko Udapadi populist derogatorily, but I do confess that inasmuch as its technical competence is incongruent with its artistic achievement (or lack thereof), if we keep sidelining that aforementioned spate of epics, we?ll be entertaining the illusion that our cinema should subsist on obscurantism. Thankfully, therefore, Aloko Udapadi does ascertain some value. What that value is will be coloured by our perceptions of our own history, but that?s peripheral to what I?m trying to get at: that Chathra Weeraman?s movie is culturally important. I won?t rate it highly, but I will recommend that you watch it. Right now.?

Bandula to go to SC on Mahendran?s citizenship
	
The joint opposition said today it would file a case in the Supreme Court seeking to clarify whether the duties and responsibilities carried out by former Central Bank governor Arjuna Mahendran were legal on the basis of not being a Sri Lankan citizen but that of Singapore.
Referring to the last week?s Appeal Court ruling disqualifying Geetha Kumarasinghe from being a parliamentarian because of her dual-citizenship, it queried as to how a citizen of another country could hold a top post like that of CB governor when a dual-citizenship holder is disqualified from being an MP.
?Clause 165 of the Constitution states that all public officers should take an oath prior to commencing duties. However, Mr. Mahendran has told the Committee On Public Enterprises (COPE) that neither did take any oath nor did anyone ask him to do so. How can a foreign citizen without taking the oath of loyalty to the country function as the CB governor and continue to sign Sri Lanka's currency notes,? MP Bandula Gunawardane told a news conference.
He said currency notes of Rs.100 and 5,000 signed by Mr. Mahendran were in circulation and the fact that he was a citizen of Singapore raised their legitimacy.
The MP said a citizen of Singapore could not work for the betterment of another country because Singapore does not recognise dual-citizenships. ?As far as we know, Mr. Mahendran is still a foreign citizen and had not abandoned his Singapore citizenship,? he said.
He said he would file action in the Supreme Court after Vesak so as to obtain a determination on this matter and to ascertain whether the currency notes signed by Mr. Mahendran were valid.
Clause 165 of the Constitution says any public officer is required by the Constitution to take an oath of allegiance on taking up office or duties.
?Any such officer of an office failing to take and subscribe to such oath or make and subscribe such affirmation after the commencement of the Constitution on or before such date as may be prescribed by the Prime Minister by Order published in the Gazette shall cease to be in service or hold office,? the Constitution says.

Conflict in South Sudan has displaced 2 million children: UN
	
DPA, 08th MAY, 2017- The civil war in South Sudan has forced more than 2 million children to flee their homes, two UN agencies said Monday. Children make up 62 per cent of the more than 1.8 million South Sudanese refugees who have arrived mainly in Uganda, Kenya, Ethiopia and Sudan, according to the statement by the UN children?s fund UNICEF and the refugee agency UNHCR.
More than 1 million children have meanwhile been internally displaced.
?No refugee crisis today worries me more than South Sudan,? said Valentin Tapsoba, Africa director for UNHCR. ?That refugee children are becoming the defining face of this emergency is incredibly troubling.?
South Sudan was plunged into a civil conflict when a split between President Salva Kiir and his former deputy Riek Machar escalated in December 2013. Tens of?thousands have been killed?
and 3.5 million displaced.

The United National Party (UNP) has requested President Maitripala Sirisena not to reshuffle cabinet portfolios assigned to it.
According to the 19th Amendment to the Constitution, it is discretionary for the President to consult the Prime Minister in the appointment of Cabinet Ministers and assignment of subjects.
In this scenario the President is unable to reshuffle the Cabinet without consulting the Prime Minister who is from the UNP. Earlier, the President said he would carry out major changes in the government before Vesak.

## Title: Dual citizenship issue in Sri Lanka
## Section: News Features
## Date: 9 May 2017 12:05 am
Dual citizenship issue in Sri Lanka
	
Dual Nationality states that a person is a citizen of more than one country, under the laws of those states. There is no international convention which determines nationality or a citizen?s status by national laws.?
The issue could be traced back to 1867 when ?Fenin Rising? an Irish ? American was charged with treason in Ireland. The British recognized perpetual allegations in citizenship issues and American Congress passed the Expatriation Act in 1868, allowing Americans to freely denounce US citizenship. The British followed suit by formulating the British Nationality Law in 1948, removing restrictions on dual citizenship. Sri Lanka follows the British principles and models including Parliamentary procedures and allowed dual citizenship to qualified Sri Lankans. Dual citizenship is applicable to a person whose Sri Lankan citizenship has ceased under S 19/20/21 of the Citizenship Act. This is a privilege extended to a few countries such as Sri Lanka, Switzerland, Israel, Australia, Barbados, Bangladesh, Canada, Cyprus, USA, South Korea, South Africa, Greece, France, Finland, Germany, Iraqi, Ireland, Hungary, Iceland, Sweden, Slovenia,Syria,Serbia, Armenia, Lebanon, Malta, Spain, Tango, Philippines, Sierra Leone, Pakistan, Portugal and Turkey.There are 53 countries with restrictions including India and Japan. Singapore and Nepal are confined to their national laws on the decision on this national issue. This issue has raised new political and legal issues and complications in view of many other members of the Parliament who are alleged to hold dual citizenship, and if so their eligibility to continue to be members of the Parliament. USA, Britain and Israel are pioneers of the concept and the applicability of dual citizenship. In Israel there is a mechanism to obtain citizenship ? dual- (Jus Sanguinis) on condition to abide by the requirement to military services, with the right to return (conditional), though it is said that every Israeli worldwide has the right to be a citizen provided their Jewishness is proven. UK and USA almost follow the same pattern. ?
Dual Citizenship is a privilege and not a right
Dual nationality is not a right but a privilege for a citizen to enjoy the rights and privileges of one or more countries to own properties, invest and conduct businesses and enjoy restricted privileges with the right to denounce or to be taken away by the state at any given stage. In Sri Lanka Dual nationality holders could hold public office and be elected as Members of the Parliament until the introduction of the 19th amendment to the Constitution of Sri Lanka which expressly prohibits a citizen of Sri Lanka who is also a citizen of another country from contesting elections. Today this issue has come to light with the decision of the Court of Appeal on the election of Geetha Kumarasinghe to the Parliament with the allegation that the office was held whilst she was still a citizen of Switzerland. The 19th amendment came into effect on May 15, 2015. Nominations for the Parliamentary elections closed on July 13, 2015; as such it was theoretically possible for election department officials to have rejected nomination papers with a candidate rendered ineligible on account of holding dual citizenship. The election commissioner apparently had no provision to reject the entire nomination list. Now that the MP has appealed against the order, she could continue to be a Member of Parliament until the determination of the appeal. Holding public office by a non-national or dual citizenship holder is a grey area to be resolved with the maize of citizenship issues and anticipated constitutional changes on the table. Appointments of Arjuna Mahandran (Singaporean National) as the Governor of Central Bank and Gotabaya Rajapaksa ( Dual Citizenship holder) as the Defence Secretary may be topics of discussion and controversies that need to be resolved. This may be an important to constitution making and the new dual citizen holders will have an impact on the economy, society and legal system. ?
Legal Basis and issues
Legal basis and issues are still complicated. Like the 18th amendment, 19th amendment is also a hurriedly drafted and passed legislation on various political strategies aiming at individuals rather than political ideologies or polices. It is no secret that the intention of the hurriedly passed legislation is to block Mahinda Rajapaksa and Gotabaya Rajapaksa - the possible contenders in future power struggles- reminds us Mrs. Bandaranaika and her rival J.R. Jayawardena. These are political games manipulating the legal structure for the advantage of those in power. In the present controversy there is also a question on the jurisdiction as to whether the proper method should have been an election petition to the Supreme Court rather than the writ of ?Quo Warranto?, pleaded by the petitioners in the Court of Appeal, and the procedure adopted which will be canvassed heavily in the Supreme Court in the near future. This will open a floodgate of cases of many others with dual citizenship elected before the 19th amendment. The Supreme Court is the final appellate court with enormous powers inherent as well as from the legislature and the decisions taken, considering the supremacy of the Parliament, the intention of the legislature, power of the mandate of the people and the supremacy of the Parliament and its inherent powers. ?
Threat of contempt and constitutionality
Now there is another development and threat to file further documents by the petitioners for contempt of court for citizens. The court/judgment and not complying with the order forthwith. Contempt of court is disobeying, offending and disrespecting the court order undermining the dignity and authority of the court and the grounds of the offence will depend on the facts, circumstances and allegations. The Article is clear in that ?No person shall be elected as a member of Parliament or to sit or vote in Parliament if Article 92 (b), 20 (4) 91 (1 (d) X111 is contravened, subject to appeal and valid explanation to the controller of immigration, and the Speaker of the Parliament.? The misconception that the defendant or/and accused will have no right to comment is a false notion based on hearsay, as there is ample opportunity to criticize the judgment/determination of the court/tribunal with?
the parameter. ?
At a crossroad today
We are in a maze of controversies and a crossroad in the citizenship issue in the absence of a proper nationality laws as in the UK. With the influx of uncontrolled offers of dual citizens, we must expect consequences in the near future. In the UK and US, naturalisation is necessary to acquire citizenship and to convert to dual later. There could be an imbalance in the economy if the floodgate is opened with no control. ?Israeli citizens in the USA are required to take allegiance on oath as patriotic Americans. The Citizenship Act No. 18 of 1948 is outdated and inadequate with the modern trends and challenges and must be redrafted to be compatible with national standards/aspirations and international norms. When all other states are practicing protectionism it is time for us to adopt new measures through the proposed constitution in making. ?

A number of government and opposition politicians attended this birthday party where liquor flowed like water.
The politico in question had a drink too many and was almost in a drunken coma when he groggily walked up to the orchestra and told them that he wished to entertain the audience with a song. Given the nod, the politico broke into a song, but it was a pathetic attempt and the guests highly soaked by now began greeting the politico with loud boos for his vocal cords were making only slurred incoherent sounds.

HNB to empower and enable MSMEs with Webxpay

?
Sri Lanka?s most digitally innovative bank, HNB PLC announced a breakthrough partnership with e-commerce Software as a Service (SaaS) provider, Webxpay, to launch an integrated e-commerce platform aimed at empowering Micro, Small and Medium businesses in Sri Lanka to adapt to e-commerce.
With technology driven paradigms engulfing all walks of life in Sri Lanka, Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) too are seeking cost effective solutions capable of serving as a gateway into the island?s rapidly expanding e-commerce market.?
Having consistently served as a ?partner in progress? to SMEs across the country for decades, HNB announced that it would be launching a island-wide programme across all of its 252 customer centres, the bank is ideally positioned to enable a cashless payments revolution in Sri Lanka.?
Webxpay, a startup who has been in business for about 10 months and who profess to be the ?face of change in Sri Lanka? have already on-boarded over 450 merchants into their platform, and these merchants are transacting and reaching out to not only a larger share of the Sri Lankan market, but also generating sales out of far out markets like the USA.
Commenting on the groundbreaking partnership with Webxpay, HNB Managing Director/CEO, Jonathan Alles said: ?MSMEs are the backbone of the Sri Lankan economy, contributing a significant proportion of for a large slice of the Country?s GDP, despite lagging behind the larger businesses due to limited access to financial services and technology based on cost factors and complexity. This program will provide MSMEs in Sri Lanka a cost effective and easy to use all-in-one solution to compete with their larger counterparts on equal footing?.?
?Apart from the economic benefit to these MSMEs, the socio-economic developmental impact of this programme will be massive, as this programme will sustainably contribute to financial inclusion, inclusive growth, job creation, women empowerment, skill development, access to finance, access to markets, opportunity to compete and poverty alleviation,? he added.
Placing particular emphasis on the island?s booming tourism sector, Alles pointed out that while Sri Lanka had over 7,700 properties listed, in excess of 90 percent of these properties lacked an efficient platform to transact online; another area which he believes HNB?s partnership with Webxpay will yield valuable benefits from SMEs.?
Nazeem Mohamed, the Founder/Director of Webxpay said; ?After being in the payments industry for over 2 decades, together with my co-founders Omar Sahib and Sajith Chanuka, we identified a big void in the marketplace where MSMEs lacked access to a cost-effective solution to compete globally on an equal footing. To fill this void, we developed our suite of cost effective products, and our current portfolio of 450 merchants in a period of ten months (compared to 1,000 businesses transacting through e-commerce over a 13-year period) is testament to our thesis. Our mission is to be the ?face of change in Sri Lanka?, and with support from our ?partner in progress?, HNB we are targeting to increase our merchant portfolio to 20,000 in 5 years. We are privileged to be partnering with HNB in their mission to empower and enable MSMEs in Sri Lanka through e-commerce.?

HSBC partners with GOSL for 11th sovereign bond issuance
	
The Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL), on behalf of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka, successfully launched and raised US$1.5 billion in a 10-year bond.?
The transaction was the 11th US Dollar benchmark offering in the international bond markets by Sri Lanka since 2007. ?The issuance was priced with a coupon of 6.200 percent p.a., maturing on 11 May 2027.?
HSBC, which has been consistently ranked as the No.1 Debt Capital Markets Bookrunner in Asia acted as the Joint Lead Manager, Bookrunner and the Ratings Advisor for this issuance.?
Mark Prothero, CEO HSBC Sri Lanka and Maldives said, ?HSBC is proud to be the only bank to have consecutively partnered the Sovereign on all its bond issuances since 2007. The 10-year bond is another significant achievement for the Sovereign and demonstrates its ability to remain nimble and responsive to investor needs. The wide engagement from different pockets of interest further demonstrates the breadth of the Sovereign?s investor base and confirms its position as a premier issuer in the capital market. Retracing our 125 year history in Sri Lanka, this manifests HSBC?s strong and continued commitment to the economic development of the country.?
Fitch Ratings, Moody?s Investors Service and Standard and Poor?s have rated the both Issues at ?B+?, ?B1? and ?B+? respectively. The final order books stood at in excess of US$ 11 billion with an oversubscription ratio of 7.3 times spread across 500 participating accounts.

Invest SL Forums spark renewed interest among Australian investors
	
Foreign inflows originating from Australia have recorded a marked improvement during the month of April, recording a surge since the recently conducted Invest Sri Lanka Investor Forums in Australia.?
The daily average inflows originating from Australia since the forum has marked an improved to Rs. 23.22 million, rising from an average of Rs. 0.87 million recorded over the preceding 11 months. In total, Australian inflows have contributed a total of Rs. 487.62 million since the events Down Under ? a 94 percent portion of the total purchases originating from the country in 2017.?
The post forum surge in investment from the country has also placed Australia as the 7th largest contributor to foreign purchases in the month of April, a marked improvement from its ranking of 14 prior to conducting the events in 2017 and 19 in 2016.
Commenting on the development, the Head of Market Development at CSE Niroshan Wijesundere said, ?We are pleased to see the events in Australia having a positive effect on the turnover flowing in from the county. This is consistent with a trend that we have experienced with Foreign Investor Forums conducted in the past, where these events almost immediately rejuvenate the interest in the Sri Lankan capital market. The presence of the stock brokers who traveled with the delegation to Australia also played a vital role in following up and securing such investments.??
He also pointed out that partnering with event sponsors and the Sri Lankan High Commission in Australia, the Australian High Commission in Sri Lanka, bilateral associations and business councils was critical to hosting three successful Forums in both Sydney and Melbourne.?
A strong community of individuals with a Sri Lankan origin eager to look at new Sri Lankan investment opportunities and the celebration of 70 years of diplomatic ties between Sri Lanka and Australia presented the CSE with a unique opportunity to promote the capital market in Australia.?
Growth in overall foreign investor contribution to turnover?
Overall foreign investor activity has also recorded a rise in 2017, with a net foreign inflow of Rs.16.5 billion, a vast improvement compared to previous years, which recorded an inflow of Rs. 383.5 in 2016 and an outflow of Rs. 5.3 billion in 2015.?
Foreign investor contribution to total turnover in 2017 stands at 50.1 percent, another improvement in comparison with 42 percent in 2016 and 34.4 percent in 2015, which also points towards a growing interest among foreign investors in the Sri Lankan capital market.
Rise in stock market indices in 2017?
On another note, the share price indices at the CSE have also made consistent gains in the month of April, with The Benchmark All Share Price Index (ASPI), crossing the 6,500 mark on Thursday the 20th of April.?
The index closed at 6,602.44 points by the end of trading for 4th May, a 6.01 percent increase in the index in 2017 (year-to-date). The S&P SL 20 index, which features the CSE?s 20 largest and most liquid stocks has also improved consistently, making a 8.26 percent gain in 2017 (year-to-date) and closing at 3,785.15 points by 4th May.

JO filled only 40% of Galle Face Green: CBK
	
Former president Chandrika Kumaratunge said today that those at the joint opposition May Day rally were confined to a limited area of some 40% of the Galle Face Green.
She said the JO had published photographs in the media in the pretense of giving the impression that the JO was a powerful political force.
She said if all the people who participated in the SLFP May Day parade at Gatambe in Kandy were contained in one ground, the crowd at the SLFP May Day rally would have been much more than that at the Galle Face Green.
?The JO May Day rally was not bigger than the May Day rallies of the SLFP and the UNP. I have the pictures. They did not have a parade. They filled the ground and did not allow the people to move and had tight security right throughout and confined them to the allotted area. They get everyone to take photos and put them in the media with the hope of scaring the people that they are strong,? she told a news conference in Colombo.
Ms. Bandaranaike said the organizers of the SLFP May Day rally at the Gatambe did a foolish thing to allow the people who participated in the May Day parade leave without attending the rally.
?I do not know who organised the rally. They did not allow some people to come inside the grounds. We had a huge May Day parade. It left at about 1.30 p.m. The tail end of the parade was still coming in at about 6.00 p.m,? she said. (Ajith Siriwardana)

Lankan guilty of second-degree murder in Canada
	
A jury in Canada that had been deliberating since last week found Amalan Thandapanithesigar, who came to Canada as Sri Lankan refugee, guilty of second-degree murder for having stabbed his neighbour in C?te-des-Neiges, Montreal in Canada, Montreal Gazette reported.
Thandapanithesigar was originally charged with first-degree murder, but the jury found him guilty of the lesser charge late Monday afternoon. It meant the jury was probably not convinced he planned the murder even though they heard evidence that, a week before the murder was carried out, the victim had made unwelcome advances on Thandapanithesigar?s wife.
During his trial, Thandapanithesigar admitted he stabbed Jeyarasan Manikarajah, was also from Sri Lanka on June 23, 2014. But, he testified, he stabbed the victim in a fit of anger after the victim called him several names during an argument, including a vulgar term for vagina in their shared Sri Lankan language.
The presiding judge in the trial, Jean-Fran?ois Buffoni, asked the seven men and five women if they could reach a unanimous decision on a sentence recommendation. While Thandapanithesigar automatically received a life sentence with the murder conviction his parole eligibility can be set at anywhere between 10 and 25 years. The jury foreman told Buffoni that the majority of the jurors recommended the parole eligibility be set at the 10-year minimum but that a few disagreed. One juror felt Thandapanithesigar?s eligibility should be set at the maximum, 25 years.
At that point, defence lawyer Elise Pinsonneault asked that the jury be asked individually if they all agreed with the second-degree verdict.
?At least two of the jurors won?t stop crying,? Pinsonneault said. ?They keep looking me in the face, with a look of distress.?
When each juror was asked individually they all said they agree with the verdict. However, juror number 12, the same man who recommended Thandapanithesigar serve the maximum 25 years before he is eligible for full parole, hesitated a long time before he uttered ?agree.? It was a sign that the juror was a holdout and was initially convinced Thandapanithesigar was guilty of first-degree murder. Jury deliberations are secret in Canada so it is impossible to know how the decision was reached.
Buffoni will hear arguments on Thandapanithesigar?s parole eligibility on May 29.

Lichens as Bio - indicators
	
Just look around, on tree barks, rock surfaces and even in soil you can find them easily, called as lichens. They are not just single organisms but is a symbiotic association that exist between fungi and one or more species of algae or cyanobacteria. Fungus, mycobiont, mostly can be a ascomycete or rarely can be a basidiomycete protect symbiont which reside inside, from the direct light and from dessication. ?
Algae or cyanobacteria, phycobiont, in turn provide fungus the photosynthates. The lichen body which is also called as thallus is composed of different layers made of parts of fungus mycelium and cells of algae, depending on the differences between these layers there are mainly three types of lichens. Foliose, fruticose and crustose lichens, out of which the most sensitive to the environmental pollutants is the foliose. ? The bio-indicative nature of lichens arise due to the fact, lack of a cuticle as in plant leaves. Therefore absorb all substances. Some gases present in the air and various contaminants may harm the lichen thallus. It may result in differences in the composition of lichen communities. Most air pollutants harm lichens by inducing acid rains. Lichens in response to sulphur dioxide gas concentration in the air show a lichen zonation pattern in the species composition. Due to these effects the morphology of lichens including the diameter, nature of the middle area of the thallus, chlorophyll content may change. The air pollutants such as sulphur dioxide, oxides of nitrogen, ozone, fluorides tolerating ability of different lichen species vary. They act as good air pollutant indicators. ??

?When it comes to heavy metals and trace elements that accumulated in ecosystems due to human activities. They cause a irreversible harm to the lichens, in most cases they are lethal. The major source of the heavy metal and trace elements is the vehicular smoke. Heavy metals accumulate in the thallus, so by the analysis of thallus we can correlate those concentrations with that in the environment so they indicate such contamniants present, which is very important to humans. Lichens act as bio-indicators, are organisms that represents the quality of the environment. Understanding of the tell-tale nature of them is a clue given to found out whether the environment is polluted or not. ??

Thousands of jubilant Emmanuel Macron supporters packed the courtyard of the Louvre as they celebrated his landmark victory in the French presidential election. ??
Crowds waving blue, white and red tricoloure flags, danced, cheered and even kissed outside the iconic Paris museum as the overwhelming victory results were announced with Macron set to be France?s youngest ever president. ? According to exit polls, the 39-year-old former banker, has secured a landslide win as voters are believed to have rejected Marine Le Pen?s populist vision of France. ? Macron?s victory is made all the more impressive by the fact his party En Marche! (?On the Move?) has existed for slightly more than a year.Speaking for the first time since the results were announced, Macron said the election marked the dawn of a new age for France. ?He said: ?A new page of our history has turned.? ??
?I know the divisions of our nations have pushed people to extremes and I know the anger and the doubt in our country. ?
?It?s my duty to listen to this. ?
?It?s about organising solidarity, fighting all forms of inequality and discrimination, ensuring unity and guaranteeing the security of the nation.? Le Pen delivered her concession speech less than 15 minutes after official exit polls confirmed her devastating defeat. ?

People?s Leasing 4Q hurt by sharp drop in leases, compressed margins  and higher VAT
	
People?s Leasing & Finance PLC (PLC), a licensed finance company with an asset base of Rs.150 billion, saw its performance for the March quarter being impacted by narrowing margins, slower growth in loans and leases and higher provisions for possible bad loans.?
But the largest impact came from the higher financial services value added tax (VAT) as full impact of the VAT increase felt on the company?s?
bottom-line.?
According to the interim financial results, the PLC group reported earnings of 71 cents a share or little over a billion rupees for the January - March quarter (4Q17), down 8.0 percent from the same quarter last year.?
The VAT & NBT financial services rose sharply to Rs.377 million from Rs.261 million during the corresponding quarter in 2016.?
The leasing giant had given only Rs.1.3 billion in loans and leases during the quarter as the restrictions on vehicle leasing were tightened while the interest rates also shot up. ?
Meanwhile, for the full year ended March 31, 2017, the PLC group reported earnings of Rs.2.81 a share or Rs.4.26 billion, roughly a 10 percent decline from the last year. ?
For the full year, PLC on a standalone basis grew its loans and other receivables by Rs.24.2 billion or 22 percent. Nevertheless this was more than twice the Rs.11.5 billion growth during the last financial year. ?
During the quarter, the company made Rs.188 million as provisions against possible bad loans from a provision reversal of Rs.24 million a year ago.?
The net interest margin (NIM) appears to have taken a dent during the financial year as reflected by close to 60 percent increase in interest expenses compared to just under 40 percent rise increase in interest income.?
Licensed finance companies are prone to compressing margins than the banks as their leases, which account for a larger share of their asset portfolio, is unable to re-price even if the interest rates rise.?
However in general their NIM is higher than of the banks because they charge higher interest rates.?
According to the segmental results of the company, only the loans segment had recorded positive results.?
The net fee and commission incomes also fell by 8.0 percent year-on-year (YoY) for the quarter probably as a result if lackluster growth in loans and leases.?
Personal expenses rose from Rs.561 million to Rs.823 million for a quarter.?
Meanwhile, during the year, the company?s deposit base grew by little under Rs.11 billion while the short-term borrowings from banks rose by Rs.9.2 billion.?
In April, the Central Bank extended the company the time till March 31, 2018 to complete the amalgamation of its associate company, People?s Merchant Finance PLC. The merger was first announced in July 2016.?
The company also has a fully owned insurance subsidiary, People?s Insurance Limited among others.?
On May 15, 2016, PLC bought 51 percent stake of Alliance Leasing and Finance Company Limited, a finance company in Bangladesh.
The company in November 2016 appointed Ahamed Sabry Ibrahim as its Chief Executive Officer Designate.
As at March 31, 2017, People?s Bank held 75 percent stake of PLC while the state controlled private sector pension fund, Employees? Provident Fund, held 5.43 percent stake.

Prince Philip?s visit to Wilpattu: ?Prince Charming?, an Officer and a Gentleman
	
?
The announcement by Prince Philip of his retirement from public life, brought back memories of his visit to Sri Lanka and Wilpattu when he was President of the World Wild Life Fund. It was a great honour when the late President Jayewardene, our President at the time, asked my late husband, who was the Deputy Minister of Tourism and Wild Life at the time and me, to accompany and host His Royal Highness at Wilpattu on behalf of his government. ??
I went ahead to get the house at Wilpattu ready for the Royal visit, and was at the front door to welcome His Royal Highness, when he arrived at Wilpattu with my husband. I walked up to him and asked him what he would like to drink, he stated his choice of tipple and I walked into the kitchen to get some ice for his drink. To my surprise I found that he was just behind me and insisted on getting the ice himself, stating that it was indeed a pleasant surprise to get ice in the jungle. Contrary to reports in the media about his rudeness, I found him most courteous at all times. ??
?
?
It was just Prince Philip, his valet, the Scotland Yard detective and my husband and I in one bungalow, while the rest of his group were housed in another bungalow. But his group, plus the then Director of Wild Life, Dr. Lyn de Alwis, had their meals with us, at our bungalow. He was a most interesting, knowledgeable conversationalist, well informed and had done his home work well. He knew that I was an Anglican, niece of the late Bishop Lakdasa de Mel who had preached for the Royal family at Windsor and that I was married to a Buddhist. After dinner on our first evening, before he retired for the night, I asked him what time he would like his cup of coffee, in the morning. But, we heard him waking up much earlier, so I dressed quickly, and ran down the stairs to get his cup of coffee. To my horror, I found that the staff of the Lanka Oberoi who were doing the catering had locked up the kitchen and retired to the bungalow, allotted to them. The ASP on duty and I managed to open the door, and I got his coffee ready, in the nick of time, just as he arrived downstairs. I had told the Prince about a Mr. Spendlove at the British High Commission who kept calling me before the visit, insisting that a special bed be sent for the Prince by them to Wilpattu. After that, each time the phone specially installed for his visit rang, he would tease me and say ?that must be Spendlove for you on the phone?. On our drives through the jungle, he often took the wheel of the jeep and would always turn round to me, I sat at the back, my husband sat beside him in front to inquire whether he was driving too fast and whether I was comfortable. He knew the name of every bird we saw, and kept strictly to the rules set for visitors. The only times he got annoyed, was when he felt there was too much security and asked my husband whether their presence was necessary. ?

"He knew the name of every bird we saw, and kept strictly to the rules set for visitors. The only times he got annoyed, was when he felt there was too much security and asked my husband whether their presence was necessary"
?
?One morning, while we were having breakfast, I noticed some photographers a fair distance away, focusing their cameras on us, as we ate on the verandah. I had read that the royal family didn?t like being photographed, while eating and mentioned this to my husband in Sinhala.HRH was quick to pick up the vibes, asked me what I said and remarked, ?Don?t worry, it doesn?t matter they are too far away.? He was familiar with Sri Lanka, having been here during the war, and mentioned that he would like the rest of his party to see Anuradhapura and asked me if it was possible to do so. We promptly adhered to his request and made arrangements with President?s House at Anuradhapura, to have a meal ready for us. He drove there too with my husband and me as passengers, drove to all the historic sites, explaining them all to his staff who followed in another vehicle. He insisted on piloting the plane which belonged to Her Majesty, when we returned to Colombo. An amusing incident during the flight was when he suddenly walked into the cabin where I sat, having given the piloting over to the co-pilot. I stood up so fast that I banged my head. He told me that he took such care when he piloted the plane as I was on it and now I had hurt my head! This remark made my day! ?
Later on, at the farewell banquet hosted in his honour, by President Jayewardene, he made special mention of me to the President, and said he had been looked after well and that all arrangements made for his food and comfort couldn?t have been better. I recall going to the airport the next morning to see him off with my husband and there again, he said, ?I didn?t expect you to come so early in the morning?. He was a real Prince Charming, an officer and a gentleman, and his visit to Wilpattu remains among my most treasured memories. He gave us a book written by him as a memento of his visit, asked us to contact him when we came to London, which we never did and wrote me a letter of sympathy when my husband died. I always enjoyed keeping up with his busy life, by reading about him in UK newspapers and magazines as he is a special kind of person.?
But he deserves a rest and the opportunity to spend more quality time with his children and grandchildren.?
I wish him a happy and contented retirement from public life. ? ?

RTI: Rocky road to Sri Lanka?s new transparency culture
	
It has been three months since the implementation of the Right To Information (RTI) Act and it hasn?t been a smooth ride. Many issues have cropped up, such as the lack of public awareness, people not being able to access the necessary officers to give in their requests, inadequately trained officers, confusion with the application process etc. With the RTI Act citizens can receive information from all public authorities. According to officials the road to Sri Lanka?s new transparency culture will be long and hard, but in order to achieve the end goal, people need to put in the work and effort to incorporate this new culture into our system. ??
?
RTI Process
Explaining the process in which the appeal reaches the RTI Commission, Kishali Pinto-Jayawardena said, ?Firstly, the information request, when filed to the Information Officer (IO), must be considered on the basis of maximum disclosure. If there is a denial of information, the Information Officer is duty bound to show that the harm caused by releasing the information is greater than the public interest. This is because there is a public interest override applying against all the exemptions under which the denial can be made. It would be a mistake for Information Officers to focus on the exemptions rather than the public interest override as the RTI Commission would assess his/her compliance to the RTI Act against that fundamental test in the first instance.? ?
?Secondly, if there is a denial, the matter must first go to the Designated Officer in that public authority. In both these instances the respective officers must state the reasons, the specific section relating to the exemption under which they?re turning down the request and justify it as not falling within the public interest override. Finally, it is only if that denial is upheld by the Designated Officer(DO) that the information requester could appeal to the RTI Commission.? ?
?These are 3 independent and separate steps in the process.The RTI Commission cannot advise the Information Officer or the Designated Officer on whether he/she should refuse or give the information. It is up to those Officers to independently exercise his/her minds. If they don?t exercise their minds properly under the RTI Act, then the Commission will be called upon to make a determination.? ??
?If an information requester skips one stage of the process, for example, if he/she files the request to the Designated Officer not to the Information Officer or files it to the Information Officer then goes directly to the Commission, the request will not be considered as a proper appeal to the RTI Commission and the Commission will refer the matter back to the relevant authorities and the relevant officer in that authority.? ?
?
Appointment of IOs
?The implementation of the RTI Act depends on the Public Authorities. They should do the actual work when the citizens ask for information. Currently, all over the island, the appointed number of IOs is 2776. The following table shows the breakdown of the appointment of IOs,? said Piyatissa Ranasinghe while speaking of the appointment of IOs.
?But unfortunately judicial authorities, universities and higher education institutions except for Peradeniya University, have not reported to us regarding the appointment of their IOs. Among NGOs, only Sarvodaya has informed us of their appointments.? He said.
Regarding the instances where Public Authorities have not yet appointed Information Officers, ?Pinto-Jayawardena said, ?The law is very clear, Information Officers have to be appointed for these public authorities and where one has not been appointed the Head or Chief Executive Officer automatically becomes the Information Officer. The gap here is not in the law, but the implementation process. This is all still very new to Sri Lanka as the Act was operational just three months ago. Other countries would have taken 4-5 years for implementation. These issues may soon be sorted out. But if a Public Authority deliberately resists the requirements of the Act, there will be consequences.? ??
?
"We are a poor developing country. We can?t say how long it would take, but we are monitoring and pushing for things to be done as soon as possible"
Training of IOs
?Our Ministry is responsible for the training of the Information Officers and to improve the understanding of the law among government offices. We have now conducted 7 provincial seminars, except in the North and North Western Provinces which will be conducted in May. After which we will be starting district level seminars for the Executive Officers. The first seminar was conducted in Hambantota, the Polonnaruwa seminar was conducted on May 2nd, the other seminars will be completed by June/July. Currently, nearly 16 national ministries have conducted their training sessions for their Department Heads, Corporation Heads and Ministry Officials. Other ministries too will follow. We are also expecting the start of the RTI resource centre in August/September ? said Mr. Ranasinghe ?
?We have also completed our Information Officer?s Handbook under the USA aid project. At the end of May we will be starting the IO?s 3 day training with the assistance of Sri Lanka Institute of Development Administration, Sri Lanka Institute of Local Governance and Management Development Training Units in the Provinces and other training authorities in the public sector.While these three agencies will provide the training we will provide the intellectual assistance, training material, training curriculum and other facilities,? he added.?
?
Sri Lanka?s Ranking
?Sri Lanka is ranked at No.3 in the world, mainly because of the rules made by the RTI Commission. There are 111 countries who have RTI in the world and each country has a commission that makes the rules. It is based on the content of the Act that the countries are ranked and not the implementation.? ??
Implementation
Speaking of how long it will take to implement the Act properly, Mr. Ranasinghe said,?Even after 10 years India has not implemented their RTI Act properly. Implementation depends on the people?s activities. If the people aren?t actively asking for information and submitting their appeals the Act will not operate. The problem is that most of the people don?t understand the Act and its regulations. It?ll take some time for this knowledge to be absorbed by the general public. Until then the Department of Information which is under the Ministry is using radio, print media and television in order to spread awareness. Other organizations too, such as TISL and Sarvodhaya are working on public awareness.? ?
Contributing to the topic of implementation Ms. Radika Gunaratne stated that, ?Basically, it depends on the political powers and all the people who are needed to implement it properly. For example, for a developed country like the UK it took 5 years to implement the Act. We are still in our first few months, and we are a poor developing country. We can?t say how long it would take, but we are monitoring and pushing for things to be done as soon as possible.? ??
?Implementation is difficult. We need to give the government time in order to integrate this new culture into society. It?s been 10 years since India has implemented their RTI and they?re still facing problems. People need to fight and work hard in order to receive the information they require in order to integrate the Act into our system? She concluded.?
?
?
?What we find is that implementation is not happening as smoothly as expected. It all depends on the individuals concerned. But at the very central levels I believe that there is still lack of training and awareness on the part of the state about the obligations under the RTI. The timeline, the legal obligations and any kind of clarity around the exceptions seems to be lacking.? ??
?In addition to this the state needs to focus on getting its record management in order, which means classifying documents according to whatever index they chose. There are several principles involved in this classification. One is that the state needs to understand that RTI across the world is supposed to be guided by maximum disclosure. It is a matter of giving information as much as possible, whenever possible. Secondly, proactive disclosure, which is where you don?t wait for a request, nor for an interference but you proactively disclose information. Thirdly, is to preserve credibility. For instance, if there was a document with a 100 pages and one page contains the information that the requester needs, the rest too had to be disclosed. So when classifying documents and managing records you need to ensure that credibility is maintained. And later on there needs to be a perception stage from the establishment in order to proceed, which is one of openness and accountability and one that affords protection to honest officials who are accountable and transparent within the RTI framework. The RTI is not only about exposing corruption, it is also about giving retribution to officers who are doing their jobs right.? She added ?
Changes to come
Speaking of the kind of changes the country can expect if the Act is implemented properly Pinto-Jayawardena said, ?We can expect transparency in government and even in the non-government sector along with the corporate and private sector that utilize public money. The Act emphasizes a common principle of accountability that goes beyond the government. Since it was operational, family members of the disappeared in the North and the East to people who have been dispossessed of their land have been across the board filing RTI requests. In the South, parents are filing RTI requests in relation to their children not being admitted to school. The media is using it in terms of investigative reporting.Some provincial politicians have released details of official and personal travel under RTI. The Commissioner of Elections has released financial records of political parties. The Moratuwa Municipal Council, distinguishing itself among municipalities, has proactively given information on its projects and promised to have a dedicated website on RTI.The use of RTI has been quite diverse and I think that is a very positive factor that we have seen in the past couple of months.? ?
Speaking of how the Act can benefit society, Mr. Ranasinghe said, ?If the people use it properly, things such as misappropriation of funds, corruption, misuse of public property should reduce as the people can audit the public authorities. On the other hand people can get results immediately. People can ask relevant authorities about the delays such as collection of garbage, district lighting, supply of water, etc. It can increase the efficiency of the public services and public authorities. People can get answers to their grievances and problems in the area. This will also increase the transparency and accountability of the public sector. However, it?ll take another 5/6 years to turn the society to that culture.? ?
Touching on why the Act is important, Ms. Sankhitha Gunaratne stated, ?One is that RTI is a public agent for information to be disclosed. That is on the premise the information held by the state is the information held in trust on behalf of the citizens. It is the citizens that vote and transfer their power and it is the citizens who pay for the services. In that context, it is the citizens that need to call the shots on how exactly this power that is transferred is used. The Act gives the control that has been given to the state back to the citizens through accountability and transparency so that they can see how our government works. In addition to that it is one of the main tools in transparency and it is also one of the main tools which helps us to participate in the governance.? ??
?How the RTI will affect us depends on how we implement it. If we implement the Act properly, it will be the best tool for transparency. It is good for the monitoring process in the name of public interest and it also means that there will be very few limitations to the availability of information to the public.? added Ms. Radika Gunaratne ?
Complaints on the RTI?
Ms. Radika Gunaratne further stated that,?The RTI helpline, run by the SLPI, is where citizens can call in order to receive guidance on how to file RTI requests and place their complaints on the RTI. We advise people on how and where they can get information from. Most of the calls in the first two weeks were mainly about the construction of roads and the admission of children to government schools. Afterwards people started to complain about how they were not given the information that they had requested for and that the procedures were not followed by the relevant institutions. Now people are getting discouraged. We advise people that if they go to the relevant organizations they will be able to get the information they require. However, practically this doesn?t happen. Under the Act in Section 23 (a) (1) it states that the Head or Chief Officer will automatically be the information officer if the institution does not have one. However, people face a hurdle here too. Thus, people are getting more and more discouraged by this. The problem is that the public authorities are not ready for this yet.? ?
Mr. Ranasinghe further said that the Ministry too have received a number of complaints ? Some organizations are not giving the information. Most complaints are regarding the police department, some national schools and the Road Development Authority. But if those authorities are not cooperating, the citizen should complain to the Commission. The Commission is the appealing authority. Our Ministry does not have the power to hold the institutions responsible. The citizen should appeal to the independent Commission, which is at the BMICH. The Commission will take the necessary action regarding the information.? ?
?
Public Awareness
?Right now awareness is very poor. Some Public Authorities are not aware that they are under the Act. The people are very interested, some even come from places like Matara to check on their information requests. However, most people are not aware of the Act as it has not gone to the grass root level.? said Ms. Radika Gunaratne. ?
Furthermore, she said, ?The SLPI has conducted training programmes for journalists all over the country. We have trained almost 400 journalists an d we have done workshops in media stations. We are training journalists to use this tool. The SLPI has done an enormous role to bring the RTI to the surface from the grassroots level.? ?
Speaking of the Ministries activities Mr. Ranasinghe said ?We have gazetted all the regulations, the RTI Commission has gazetted their rules. We have started our website www.rti.gov.lk. Anyone can go on to the website and see who the Information Officers are for the relevant Public Authorities. They can get details from the website. The Act and all the regulations and the RTI forms are all in the website.? ??
Speaking of their public awareness activities Ms. Sankhitha Gunaratne said, ?TISL is partnering with several other organizations such as Sarvodaya in creating awareness from the grass root level across the country. We also have an RTI bus that we take out where we assist people to file their requests as well as raise awareness. In addition to that we are maintaining our website, www.rtiwatch.lk which is dedicated to RTI and which will work as an implementation assessment mechanism.? ??

## Title: THE BIRTH OF A BUDDHIST NEW YEAR
## Section: News Features
## Date: 9 May 2017 12:01 am
THE BIRTH OF A BUDDHIST NEW YEAR
	
Excerpts of the book
The Vesak festival as celebrated in Sri Lanka today marks a fivefold significance: first, it marks the beginning of a New Year, the Buddhist New Year; second, it marks the birth of an Indian Prince who was later to become Gauthama Buddha, one of the greatest sons of India; third, it marks the day on which this prince attained Enlightenment and became the Buddha; fourth, it marks the day on which the Buddha passed away from this world, never to be born again; and finally, it marks the day on which Prince Vijaya, the founder of the Sinhalese i-ace, landed in this island, accompanied by 700 men. ?
The calendrical importance of Vesak stems from the fact that it reckons another system of chronology, the Buddhist Era, (abbreviated BE), in contrast to two others that are in use today: the Christian Era (BC and AD), and the Muslim Era (ME). ?
The western world recognizes the Christian Era which is based on a calendar known as the Gregorian calendar, named after Pope Gregory XIII who introduced it in 1582. The credit of devising the Christian Era goes to a Scythian monk who lived in Rome in the sixth century AD, Dionysius Exiguus. This Era begins from the date of the birth of Jesus Christ. It is a modification of the Julian calendar introduced by Julius Caesar in 46 BC. ?
?
?
"Modern historians express no doubt about the historicity of the Buddha. That he lived for 80 years has also received unanimous acceptance"
?
The followers of Islam, the religion founded by Prophet Muhammad, go by the Muslim Era, which starts from the year of the Prophet Muhammad?s flight from Mecca, his birth place, to Medina, where he died and was buried. The flight took place in 622 AD. ?
The Buddhists follow a third type of calendar, marking the Buddhist Era (Buddha varsha). The starting point of this Era is, however, not the birth of the Buddha but his death, which took place 80 years after his birth. ?
Modern historians express no doubt about the historicity of the Buddha. That he lived for 80 years has also received unanimous acceptance. But the exact dates of his birth and death are still matters of scholarly debate. There are two main schools of thought. ?
The first school, to which Sri Lankan Buddhists belong, reckons the year 623 BC as the date of the Buddha?s birth, and the year 543 BC as the date of his death. Buddhists of Burma, Thailand, Kampuchea and Laos also subscribe to this view. According to this school, 2000 AD is 2543 BE. ?
The second school, whose majority consists of western scholars, reckons the year 566 BC as the date of his birth, and the year 486 BC as the year of his death. The difference is due mainly to the way they calculate the year of Emperor Asoka?s coronation. ?
?
?
The Sri Lankan tradition is based on dates recorded in the two oldest chronicles of the island, Dipavamsa (the Island Chronicle) and Mahavamsa (the Great Chronicle), both written in Pali, before the sixth century AD. The traditions they follow, it is believed, were taken over from earlier works known as Atthakarhd (Commentaries). ?
The Dipavamsa, the older of the two chronicles, says: ?
dve satani ca vassani attharasa vass?ni ca ?
sambuddhe parinibbute abhisitto Piyadassano (Ch.6, v.1) ?
(218 years after the Sambuddha has passed into parinirvana Piyadassano (Asoka) was conseclared) ?
Thus, the consecration of Emperor Asoka took place 218 years after the death of the Buddha. Asoka had already reigned 4 years before he was consecrated. Sri Lankan tradition maintains that before Asoka, King Bindusara reigned for 28 years, and before him, King Chandragupta reigned for 24 years. The date of ascendancy of Chandragupta has been calculated with reference to Greek sources, and the date of the Buddha?s birth, will thus vary according to these calculations. ?

## Title: Tobacco Consumption and Media?s role
## Section: News Features

Tobacco Consumption and Media?s role
	
?Even the World Bank has recommended that developing countries should not encourage cigarette industries. An economy dependent on cigarettes and liquor will not in any way be a sustainable economy,? the media discussion on ?Exposing the false statements disseminated by the tobacco industry? revealed. ??
?The tobacco industry is publicizing false statements?
?- Dr. Pubudu Sumanasekara - Executive Director of ADIC
?
The Ceylon Tobacco Company (CTC) has made arrangements to increase the price of a cigarette to Rs.50 as a result of increasing the taxes on cigarettes by the government. The tobacco industry is publicizing many article-like ads using print media. Most of these articles help the tobacco company indirectly. They falsely use terms like ?experts say? and ?survey reports?. ??
They are creating a story that the increase in cigarette prices have led cigarette consumers to use beedi. This is false as there is no drastic change in the importing of Tendu leaves needed to make beedi; analysing 20 years? worth data on Tendu leaf imports has revealed this. Tobacco companies have misled the media and the finance ministry purposely, hiding part of the chart showing Tendu leaf imports. The hidden truth is that the tobacco company has other cigarette products such as Capstain priced at Rs.20; but the so-called increase hasn?t affected this products? market. Similarly, to jeopardize the enforcement of laws on legally manufactured cigarettes, tobacco companies are trying to benefit from this by highlighting the illicit cigarette business. It was pointed out that the unseen forces behind the said illicit businesses too are the multinational companies. ??
Though the tobacco company talks of a decrease in government taxes and revenues due to the escalation of cigarette prices, this is false, and tobacco companies are engaged in predicting a collapse in the near future of the tobacco industry. They are trying to discourage and mislead the government?s policymakers by not disclosing the revenues generated by VAT imposed on cigarettes by the government. ??
?
"The government should refrain from entering into partnerships and agreements with the tobacco industry. They should provide assistance to tobacco control legislation. Governments should prohibit the involvement of the tobacco industry in any youth, public education and other tobacco control initiatives"
?Governments should prohibit ?the involvement of the tobacco industry in any youth, educational and other tobacco control initiatives??
- Professor Jennifer Perera, Dean of the Faculty of Medicine, University of Colombo.?
?Sri Lanka is the fourth country in the world and the first Asiatic country to ratify the FCTC (Framework Convention on Tobacco Control) treaty, the first global public health treaty adopted in May 2003 at the 56th World Health Assembly-the decision-making body of the WHO (World Health Organization). The FTCT treaty was powered in 2005. By now, 180 countries have ratified the treaty. It safeguards present and future generations from the social and economic impacts of the tobacco industry. The FTCT gives us the required law enforcement needed to protect public health policies. ??
?The government should refrain from entering into partnerships and agreements with the tobacco industry. They should provide assistance to tobacco control legislation. Governments should prohibit the involvement of the tobacco industry in any youth, public education and other tobacco control initiatives. Governments should prevent tobacco-related conflicts of interest for government bodies, officials and employees. They should also regulate purported ?socially responsible? activities carried out by the tobacco industry. Governments should prohibit incentives, privileges and benefits for the tobacco industry.? ??
Describing the CCT?s (Centre for Combating Tobacco) history, she noted ?The CCT is the regional observatory in the South East Asia region. The organization is the result of negotiations between the WHO and Sri Lanka, especially NATA, (National Alcohol and Tobacco Authority). ADIC (Alcohol Drug Information Centre) and SLMA (Sri Lanka Medical Association) are also in the partnership. ??
?They promote doubt and confusion in society??
- Dr. Mahesh Rajasuriya, Director of CCT
?
?The CCT was established in May 2016. We were doing research into tobacco and controlling it, even before the institution was established. The main mandate of the CCT is to monitor the tobacco industry in the country and the region. Now it is happening in a more systematic manner and on an academic level. This fight is not between smokers and non-smokers but a fight for us - you, me, political leaders and even tobacco company employees. We are fighting with the industry. In our observations we noted that tobacco companies are trying to maintain a good image. However, it has been observed around the world that the reality is very different. One in two smokers will die prematurely. ??
The WHO has the tobacco industry?s so-called conspiracies listed as intelligence gathering (to monitor opponents and social trends in order to anticipate future challenges), public relations (to mould public opinion using the media to promote stances favourable to the industry), political funding (to use campaign contributions to win votes and legislative favours from politicians), funding research including in universities ( to create doubt about the health effects of tobacco use) and smokers? rights groups (to create an impression of spontaneous grass root public support). They are even influencing politicians and scientists and spreading false statements in society. ??
The tobacco industry spreads various other false statements such as ?cigarette usage will reduce if the price is increased?. These opinions affect policymakers? minds while also spreading doubt and confusion in society regarding scientific data and research. ??
?There should be a transparent formula to increase the price of cigarettes??
- Nishan De Mel - Executive Director of Verita Research and Consultant to NATA
?The media has the power to shape public opinion. In 2014, the number of cigarettes sold was 3,560 billion. In 2015 it reported that there was a 10% increase by 3,960 billions and in 2016 cigar consumption decreased with tax amendments to 3,790 billion. Still the cigarette consumption is 7% - 8% higher than in 2014. It is the responsibility of the government to reduce cigarette consumption in the country. Yet the government has not succeeded in bringing the number down to the 2014 level. ??
In 2015 and 2016, cigarette production was higher than the sales. It is important to reduce consumption at least by 20%. It is essential to increase taxes and prices in reducing the consumption. Increasing taxes won?t affect revenue. In 2015, the government tax revenue from cigarettes was 80 billion. In 2016 it was nearly 90 billion. The government expected a tax revenue of more than 120 billion from the budget last year. The President has said the country should not depend on cigarette taxes. It is evident that revenue is increasing even though cigarette consumption has decreased by 25%. ??
Today, 74% of the price of a?
cigarette is taxes. ??
In 2013/2014 they earned Rs.8.40 as profit for each cigarette. Their gross profit was more than 14.5 billion. In 2015, this profit increased to Rs.9.25 and the gross profit rose to 17.5 billion. When the government increased the tax, the cigarette company also increased its revenue from a cigarette by 40%. This data doesn?t include the profits the cigarette company earns through investments. According to their annual report, the gross profit in 2016 was 20.3 billion. Cigarette companies are among the highest income-earners in the stock market. ??
Cigarette companies are far more powerful than the NATA due to their influence and wealth. ??
There should be a transparent formula in increasing cigarette prices and discussion about the absence of one. ??
?Illegal cigarette smuggling is brought up every three months prior to the budget?
?- Dr. Sajeeva Ranaweera of SLMA on illegal cigarette trade
?The illegal cigarette trade has been going on in this country for a while. We are reminded of this every three months prior to the budget. Tobacco companies even release the number of illegal cigarettes smuggled here but the customs and other relevant authorities don?t have this data,? Dr. Sajeeva Ranaweera said. ?
Since the 1950s, it has become clear that cigarette companies have been adding various ingredients into cigarettes and are experimenting with addiction levels. The American government sued the main tobacco companies in America, demanding compensation for the costs of providing treatment to smokers. These companies agreed to pay 225 billion dollars to the American government annually upto 2025. This relates to us because the tobacco company operating in Sri Lanka is a party in one of these four companies and 90% of the profit in tobacco company goes out of the country. And we keep sending money to treat those affected by smoking in America.? ??
Cigarette usage is reducing in European and America while it is increasing in Asia. Tobacco companies around the world are smuggling illegal cigarettes, hoping to break up tax systems and introduce new brands . There is evidence that this illegal cigarette trade is conducted by tobacco companies themselves. ??

Vesak marks fivefold significance for Buddhists in Sri Lanka - Prof. J. B. Dissanayake
	
Emeritus Professor?J. B. Dissanayaka, who researched deeply into Sri Lanka?s customs, cultures and religions, has compiled his booklet ?The Vesak Full Moon Festival? showcasing the spiritual and cultural significance of the event for Buddhists. In fact, he says Vesak gave birth to a Buddhist New Year. It is the first significance. The Buddha?s Birth, His Enlightenment and His Passing Away are the three events. The last one is the arrival of Prince Vijeya with his followers on Vesak day. Excerpts of the interview with him on the importance of the thrice-blessed event: ??
Q How do you analyse the origin of Vesak festival?
The exact beginning cannot be traced as there is no proper study done. From ancient years, we have had celebrations of it, though. Being a Buddhist country, we have had all kinds of celebrations for a long time. When the Sacred Tooth Relic was brought here, we had celebrations in Anuradhapura. From what is called Data Ge, it was taken to Abhayagiriya. There were Peraheras conducted. Chinese monk Fa-Hien described this in his travel records of Sri Lanka. He described how Dalada Perahera was there. Vesak celebration would have been there since time immemorial in this manner. The origin cannot be traced precisely. ??
Q ?How did it come into being then?
Poya Day or the full moon day of the month has always been marked with religious observances. Every Poya Day has some religious significance in our country. Vesak is the most important day marking the Birth, Enlightenment and Passing Away of the Buddha. These are the three events that took place on the full moon day of Vesak. Alongside, Mahawamsa says Vijeya landed in this country on the day the Buddha passed away in India. Mahawamsa describes how the Buddha asked ?Sakra? or the lord of gods? to look after Vijeya and his followers in this new land where his doctrine would flourish. The Buddha asked for this when he was in his death bed. ??
It means the system of kingdom also originated on Vesak Day. According to Buddhist chronicles and stories, the Buddha?s chief attendant Ananda Thera was born the same day. Then, King Suddodhana, the father of the Buddha, had a sister called ?Pamitha?. Her daughter is Yasodhara. Prince Siddhartha and Yasodara were also born the same day. Channa, head charioteer of prince Siddhartha was also born the same day. Kanthaka, the horse, was born on Vesak. By accident or miracle, all were born on the same day. Also, Bo Tree which gave shade for Prince Siddhartha to attain the Buddha-hood had also been born on a similar day. Its age is also similar to the Buddha?s age. We only celebrate the birth of Siddhartha, his becoming Buddha and his passing away. We had celebrated it during the British period even. The colonial rulers stopped it, though. ??
There are two Vesak days. The first day is meant to celebrate it spiritually and the second to celebrate it culturally. When celebrating it spiritually, people go to temples, observe five precepts (Sil in Sinhala and Sila in Pali) and meditate.?
That is a day for spiritual reflection. Five precepts are observed on a daily basis. On this day, this is extended to eight or ten precepts. You control yourself. If you observe Pansil or five precepts, you will be a better person. When this is extended beyond observance of five precepts, you control your senses. ??
The second day is marked with cultural activities- lighting lamps, watching Pandals and dramas. We listen to Bhakti Gee (Devotional Songs). We find street dramas. In the past, we had separate dance performances dedicated to 24 Buddhas (Suvisi Netum). We have drama, poetry, and painting in this manner. Today, technology has been infused for celebration. This is a new phenomenon. If you look at a Pandal, it is magical. ??

Q ?What is unique about Sinhala Buddhist?culture here?
Buddhist couture is common to all the Buddhist countries. When any religion settles on a particular culture, it takes root in that culture acquiring local aspects, however. In China, it is one form and in Tibet another. Our Buddhism is associated with agriculture here. Ours is an agricultural society. In the Himalayas, agriculture is impossible. The Buddhist doctrine - what the Buddha taught, the four Noble Truths, and the Eightfold path-is common. Around them, there are varying cultural habits. ?
Q ?Once you were the Sri Lankan Ambassador to Thailand. From your perspective, how is the cultural link between the two countries?
There are two schools of thought on Buddhism. Theravada Buddhism and Mahayana Buddhism are them. There are five Theravada countries - Sri Lanka, Thailand, Cambodia, Laos and Myanmar. Still Thailand and Cambodia have kings. It means two are kingdoms. In Thailand, in fact, there are two kings - Maharaja and Sangaraja. The head of laymen is Maharaja or the king. The head of all the monks is Sangaraja.Sangaraja is all powerful in that country.

Q ?How is Sri Lanka?s National New Year Celebration similar to that of Thailand?
What we call ?Sankranthiya or transitional period ?is called Sonkran in Thailand. They all go by Shaka years. They sprinkle water on others on the day. Unlike in Sri Lanka, They do not follow ?Nekath? system. From the earliest time, we have had very close links with Thailand. ??
Q ?How do you see the cultural element of the New Year celebration here??
There is confusion in the way we call ?the New Year?. Some call it Sinhala/Tamil New Year and others the Sinhala/Hindu New Year. It shows confusion. Here, actually two new years have got mixed up. It means two New Year concepts have been merged into one. One is the Sinhala New Year. It dawns on the first day of the first month of that year. According to the Sinhala calendar, the first month is Bak. The first of Bak, falls, during the last week of March. It did not happen. Yet, we take April 13 or 14 as the beginning of the New Year. It is actually the beginning of another year called ?Saka New Year?. It means the Sinhala New Year got mixed up with Saka New Year. The Sinhala New Year is based on the lunar calendar. A lunar month has 30 days divided into two phases- Pura and Ava. It means from the waxing moon and the waning moon. Saka New year is based on the astrological movement of the sun. It is an astrological calendar. When the sun reaches the House of Pisces, the last one, and moves to the House of Aries , the New Year dawns. ??
Sighting the new moon is the first ritual associated with the New Year. This time, the full moon day of Bak fell before the New Year days. When Robert Knox was here, he mentioned that the Sinhala New Year was celebrated on March 28. That is correct. ?
Saka is a powerful dynasty. They devised a calendar. They were Buddhists. They came to power 78 years after Christ. The Sinhalese, be they Buddhists and Christians, can celebrate the Sinhala New Year on the first day of Bak. As for Buddhists alone, they can even celebrate the Saka New Year. ??

Wimal?s idea to hoist black flags may be right: BBS
	
The government had done all the preparations to make this country a colony of India and it should be stopped, Bodu Bala Sena (BBS) General Secretary Ven. Galagodaaththe Gnanasara Thera said yesterday.
Addressing a media conference in Colombo, the Thera said MP Wimal Weerawansa may be trying to point out the reason, why we should hoist black flags during the visit of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modiour and when our country becomes a colony of India.
Mr. Weerawansa, at the May Day rally held in Galle Face green, had requested the people to hoist black flags in protest over Modi?s visit and handing over of Trincomalee port to India.
He had stated that Modi?s visit to Sri Lanka during the Vesak festival would not be in favour of the country and therefore, requested to hoist black flags.
The Thera said the President should not deceive the people by issuing statements saying the government would not take any steps to sell the country?s assets to foreign companies.
?Patriotic forces in the country and even the BBS have a doubt on the reasons to invite the Indian Prime Minister to celebrate Vesak and this should be analyzed in a different perspective,? he said. (Chaturanga Pradeep)
