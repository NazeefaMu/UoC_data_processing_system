'Damaged statue restored and back in Museum'
	
In response to a question regarding the damage caused to an antique Buddha statue, Cultural Affairs Minister S.B. Navinna said investigations revealed that a slight jolt had loosened the head of the statue at an event held at Temple Trees.
The Minister said nobody could be taken to task as it was not a deliberate act and asserted that the statue was restored, he said it had been handed over to the Museum.
There were reports that the statue dating back to the Anuradhapura era was damaged when it was taken from the National Museum to grace the exposition of the Buddha's sacred relics brought from Pakistan in view of Vesak Poya.
JVP Leader Anura Dissanayake raised a question in this regard in the House. The Minister replied that the head of this statue , dating back to the 9th century BC , had not been fixed with screws but stuck with a certain adhesive that prevailed in the ancient era.
Over the eras, he said, this bond had loosened, and a slight jolt triggered by the handling of the floor carpet at the event, aggravated it.
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said a board would be appointed to govern the affairs of the Museum and the National Art Gallery.
He said artifacts from the museum were taken out during the previous rule,but they were not returned. (Kelum Bandara and Yohan Perera)

HC orders CID to probe elephant cases individually
	
Colombo High Court Judge Manilal Waidyathilaka today further extended till June 22 the order given by him preventing the handover of the custody of 15 elephants that were being held at the Udawalawe Elephant Transit Home and the Pinnawela Elephant Orphanage, to their owners on bonds.
At the outset the inquiry, Attorneys for Good Governance marked their appearance into the case on behalf of the public and said the issues involved in the case came under the Public Property Act.
They said they would intervene into the matter on behalf of the public.
Senior State Counsel Deleepa Peiris did not object to the intervention of the Attorneys for Good Governance to the case.
State Counsel Peiris complained to the Judge that TV Channel ?Buddhist? was making comments through its channel while a court case was in progress. He asked the Judge to order the TV Channel to refrain from making such comments.
Counsel Prasanna Lal Alwis appearing on behalf of ?Buddhist TV? said all media institutions in the country were giving wide publicity to the case.
However, there was no channel to report the view of the affected party and the channel Buddhist had appeared on behalf of them.
Judge Waiyathilaka ordered the CID to carry out individual investigations on each of the 15 elephants and to come for a settlement if possible.
The matter was taken up for inquiry before the High Court on a revision application filed by the AG to set aside the order made on May 20 by Magistrate Gihan Pilapitiya to release the 15 elephants to its owners on bonds to use them for processions.
The Magistrate had made this directive on considering the submissions made by the Counsel who appeared on behalf of the owners of the elephants emphasizing the need of the elephants by certain temples to use them in processions of religious events.
However the AG had sought a revision to the Magistrate?s order emphasizing that the elephants were productions of the case and further the beasts were public property. Therefore if the beasts were released it would defy the law.
The CID took the elephants to their custody from various locations especially around the Maharagama area during their investigation into illegal capturing of wild elephants by an organized gang headed by Roshan alias Ali Roshan.
It was revealed that the gang had operated the scam conniving with some officers of the Wildlife Department who had assisted Roshan to alter the entries in the elephant register of the Wildlife Department and on forged licenses. T. Farook Thajudeen

I hated 'Sinhala Only Act': CV
	
I boycotted Sinhala language as I hated the Sinhala Only Act, NPC Chief Minister C.V Wigneswaran said.
"I stopped learning Sinhala as I disliked the implementation of the Sinhala Only Act. Hence, I explain our political shortcoming to the Sinhala media in my own broken Sinhala. If I had learnt Sinhala language properly I could have responded to any politician in fluent Sinhala," he said after declaring open the Kalaimagal statue in Kokkuvil Hindu Primary School in Jaffna yesterday morning built at a cost of Rs.700,000.
He said if meaningful reconciliation was to take place one had to learn the other?s language.
"Our people who go to Norway learn their language. Similarly, those who go to France learn French but sadly we ignore the Sinhala language. I started to learn Sinhala in 1955 and stopped learning when the Sinhala Only Act was implemented in 1956. Now I am talking to the Sinhala media about our shortcoming in broken Sinhala," he said.
"Our Sinhala brethren have started to learn Tamil as a compulsory language. Sinhala officers fluent in Tamil will be sent to the North and East very soon. Hence, we have to be cautious. Those who are not fluent in Sinhala language will be sidelined. Therefore forget politics and nurture your knowledge in Sinhala, NPC Chief Minister C.V Wigneswaran said.

MR, Gota responsible for Kosgama blast: Akila
	
Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa and former Defence Secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa should be held responsible for the Salawa Army Camp explosion, UNP Spokesman Akila Viraj Kariyawasam said today.
The former president had said the war would have to be stopped if this blast occurred under his administration.
Even Gotabaya Rajapaksa said arrangements had been made to move the army camp to another location during the tenure of the previous regime but it had to be put on hold when the then regime was defeated.
?The war came to an end in 2009 and in the six years after that they could have relocated the armoury if they wanted to. I challenge the Rajapaksas to show the written and legal documents to the people if they had plans to move the armoury to a safer area,? Mr. Kariyawasam said.
He said if the previous government wanted to remove the armoury, they had to follow internationally accepted procedures of the United Nations.
?Now they are making irresponsible statements without following relevant procedures,? he said.
He said that there were several incidents of blast that happened during the previous government?s tenure such as the Armoury store blast in Vavuniya in 2009 and the blast which occurred in 2014 when the United People's Freedom Alliance (UPFA) was about to topple.
?Without considering those incidents, the Rajapaksas are shedding crocodile tears over the Salawa Army Camp explosion,? he said. (Chaturanga Pradeep)

SL?s rank improves in 2016 Global Peace Index
	
Sri Lanka has moved up 18 notches and ranked at 97th place out of 163 countries in the 2016 Global Peace Index compiled by the Institute for Economics and Peace.
Iceland ranked 1st in the index as the most peaceful country followed by Denmark, Austria, New Zealand and Portugal.
Syria made it to the bottom of the list followed by South Sudan, Iraq, Afghanistan and Somalia.
Sri Lanka?s neighbouring countries India ranked at 141, Pakistan at 153, Afghanistan at 160, Bangladesh at 83, Nepal at 78 and Bhutan at 13.
The index report which was published on Wednesday said Sri Lanka had sought strong gains in both internal and external peace enabling it to jump up 18 positions in the rankings, the second-largest rank improvement overall.
?Improvements in political instability, likelihood of violent demonstrations and number and duration of internal conflicts all contributed to the enhancement in Sri Lanka?s domestic situation. Driving these trends was a strengthening of the country?s democratic institutions during the administration of President Maithripala Sirisena, who continues to make strides in combating corruption and reverse the authoritarianism of the previous administration,? it said.
It said President Sirisena?s government has continued to pursue a strategy of ethnic reconciliation following the end of the civil war in 2009 and that Sri Lanka has also improved its ties with India, which is reflected in an improvement in its score for relationships with neighbouring countries.
?Military expenditure has also been cut as threats to internal stability gradually dissipate, but the country?s impact of terrorism score deteriorated slightly, the report said.
Sri Lanka saw the greatest upswing in its score in the region. The country successfully conducted two sets of elections in 2015?presidential in January and parliamentary in August which brought a reformist administration with a strong mandate.

Standard Chartered conducts session for local compliance officers
	
Standard Chartered recently conducted a training session for compliance officers of local banks on the subject of ?Managing the Regulatory Process?.?
The session was conducted under the auspices of the Association of Compliance Officers of Banks (ACOB) by Standard Chartered for ASEAN and South Asia Regional Compliance Training Head P. Ananthakrishnan (Ananth), with 48 participants from banks including Indian Overseas Bank, Seylan Bank, Axis, ICICI, NTB, DFCC, Public Bank, Sampath Bank, HDFC, Commercial Bank, MCB, Bank of Ceylon, NDB, Union Bank, SDB, Amana, People?s Bank, HSBC and SLS Bank.
Ananth emphasising the importance of putting in place a structured Regulatory Engagement Plan in every bank said, ?A disciplined approach towards meeting regulator expectations is essential. The elements of such a Regulatory Engagement Plan must include correspondence, meetings and regulatory inspections. It is very important to have a process in place for orderly identification and dissemination of regulations to various ?risk owners? within the bank so that regulations can be implemented meticulously.?
The session further reiterated that all regulations should be risk prioritised based on a risk rating of ?high?, ?medium? or ?low?, depending on the impact on the institution, with the maximum importance and attention required to be paid to effective controls around the ?high? and ?medium? risk regulations. Compliance is the responsibility of every employee in the bank and not only of the compliance department, as is generally assumed. Ananth stressed that this message should be sent out strongly by the top management to all staff.
Standard Chartered Compliance Head Inam Cassim said, ?Ananth has generously included Sri Lanka in his exceedingly demanding training schedule every year for the last five years and we are grateful to be able to share his wide expertise with the industry?s compliance officers. We have consistently received very positive feedback and appreciation of these sessions.? ?

Three killed in hand grenade explosion in Thalangama
	
Three people including two women were killed and a nine-year girl was injured in a hand grenade explosion in a house at Deekin Gardens,Talangama today.
Residents of Talangama, Walpola Mudiyanselage Buddhika Neelanyani (40) - a mother of two, her relative Sirimathi Walpola (72) and an exorcist Pradeep Kumara Perera (54) died in the incident.
The nine year old daughter of the deceased Neelanayani was injured and admitted to the Accident Ward in the National Hospital.
Police said Neelanayani?s husband had deserted her and she had sought the help of the exorcist to settle the family dispute and reunite the family through charms and that the exorcist had been a welcome visitor of the house. Before long they had fallen in love and Neelanayani became his paramour.
When the relatives expressed their displeasure about her clandestine relations with the exorcist she had told him not to visit her.
However, he had attempted to continue his relations with the woman and even helped her to sell a land belonging to her expecting a commission of Rs. 1 million, but she had failed to pay the commission as promised. The exorcist who was desperate by failing to continue his clandestine relations with the woman and also not receiving the commission had often clashed with her.
Police said the exorcist had quarreled with the woman and threatened her with death, compelling her to make a complaint with the police. When the police informed him to call over at the station for an inquiry he had come with a hand grenade, and embraced the woman just as he exploded the hand grenade. Her aunt Sirimathi Walpola who attempted to save her daughter was also killed. (Sanath Desmond, Muditha Dayananda and M.I.Edirisinghe)

## Title: Why did Wild Life Department chief resign?

Why did Wild Life Department chief resign?
	
Dr. Sumith Pilapitiya a leading environmental specialist in the South Asia Environment, Water Resources and Climate Change Unit at the World Bank office who was appointed as the Director General of the Wild Life Conservation Department (WLCD) in April made a promise: ? As an environmental professional, during my tenure as director general I will not violate the Fauna and Flora Protection Ordinance or do anything detrimental to wildlife conservation in Sri Lanka. I would rather resign than be instrumental in causing a negative impact on wildlife conservation.?
Many environmentalists extended their gratitude for appointing such an ecologist who had the academic knowledge as well as extensive experience in the World Bank managing its wildlife projects.
Dr. Pilapitiya bade goodbye to his job as the lead environmental specialist for the South Asia Environment, Water Resources and Climate Change Unit at the World Bank office, and undertook this post to work on his passion of wild life specially elephants and to protect this country?s wildlife and fauna and flora. ??
However, on Monday in a controversial manner he tendered his resignation to Wildlife Minister Gamini Jayawickrama Perera. The Daily Mirror in an attempt to findout the real reason for his sudden resignation came across some serious issues which needed more clarifications by the relevant and?responsible authorities.?
According to a WLCD official, a doctor who wished to remain anonymous told the Daily Mirror that there were serious incidents which prompted Dr. Pilapitiya to resign his post.
Dr.Pilapitiya was branded as a ?stubborn? officer: Wlcd official
After Dr. Pilapitiya started his work, he has been branded as a ?stubborn? officer since he had not complied with any illegal directions of politicians or other higher authorities.
The official said so much pressure was placed on Dr. Pilapitiya over various issues and they had allegedly disrupted his work.?
There were issues; one had been regarding the release of some illegally detained elephants and more recently about a raid where a dead tiger and 46 kilos of animal meat found in the Yala National Park. Both these incidents made ?Dr. Pilapitiya to rethink about his job.
?In a previous ?instance, a person, ?representing all private elephant owners who was also holding a religiously and culturally important position of the country, had contacted Dr. Pilapitiya and asked him to release elephants to their private owners claiming they needed to be used for processions in temples. Subsequently, Dr. Piliapitiya had sought the advice of the Attorney General who had intimated that the elephants could not be released. The AG had also said that if the DG sends a request in writing [which can be interpreted as being against the law] , it can be done. Dr. Pilapitiya had refused to do so and had informed the AG that as long as he serves as DG of the Wild Life Department, he would not allow such things to happen,? the WLCD official said.
However, this incident had been reported to the President who had directed Dr. Pilapitiya to issue permits to capture the required number of elephants from forests which are under the administration of the Wildlife Conservation Department.
Dr. Piliapitiya has not agreed to initiate that directive either.?
Real Reason for resignation?
However, this had not been the main reason for the resignation of the WLCD chief. According to the departmental official, an incident when Sustainable Development and Wildlife Minister Gamini Jayawickrama Perera had exerted pressure on Suranga Ratnayake, Warden of the Yala National Park ?to apologise to Minister Sajith Premadasa was the main reason that Dr. Pilapitiya found disagreeable. It had been one of the main reasons for his resignation.?
Wild Life Conservation Department?s employees on Tuesday protested outside the Department Office in Battaramulla against the resignation of WLCD?s Director General Dr. Sumith Pilapitiya and ?political interference? within the department.?
Speaking to the , Suranga Ratnayake confirmed that the particular WLCD official?s claims and said since the day he was appointed as the warden of the Yala Wildlife Park, Minister Sajith Premadasa had allegedly pressurised the then DWC Chief Chandrasiri Bandara and the recently resigned DWC Chief Dr.Sumith Pilapitiya to remove Sunranga from his post.
Suranga Ratnayake had been appointed as the warden of the Yala Park in?February 2016.?
Before that he had been the park warden of Kumana where he worked freely without any political pressure.
?Political pressure was exerted not only on Dr. Pilapitiya but also on all former DG?s of the department. During the previous regime, MP Namal Rajapaksa had also meddled with issues in Yala. It had been a Jeep Owners? Association comprising some of his supporters that handled the administration of the Yala, not the Wild Life Department.
On June 05, I as the warden of Yala Park, sent a group for a raid that was launched on information we had received. During the raid we arrested a man who had 46 kgs of animal meats, an illegal weapon and a dead tiger whose jaws had been removed in his possession. As WLCD officials, we have the power to arrest poachers and produce them before courts. So we produced the arrested poacher before court and he was remanded. On that day, Minister Gamini Jayawickrema Perera called me and admonished me for producing the suspect ?in court without producing him before the police. But, we have the powers to produce suspects directly before a magistrate. Poachers have been killing animals as a practice in Yala for a long time.?
Sixty per cent of ?appointments in the Yala Park were Allegedly made by Minister Sajith Premadasa: Suranga rathnayake
Suranga spoke ?how Minister Sajith Premadasa who was not related to the ministry got involved in the issue.
?Sixty per cent of appointments in the Yala Park were made by Minister Sajith Premadasa. I was not allowed to do my duties by the minister. He kept visiting the park as he wished, without following Wild Life Department?s regulations. One day, I ?spoke directly to the minister [about it]. In response Minister Premadasa said that he had a habit of visiting the park and that just because I had been appointed as the new park warden, such habits could not be changed.?
Minister Jayawickrama asked me to apologise to Minister Premadasa over this incident. But, I didn?t do so, because I had done no wrong. However, after that incident, much pressure was placed on the then DWC Chief Chandrasiri Bandara and the recently resigned WLCD Chief Dr. Sumith Pilapitiya ?to remove me from this post. But, Minister Premadasa had never ?spoken to me directly regarding these issues. However by coordinating work with Dr. Pilapitiya I was able to solve a lot of issues in the Yala Park. After this recent raid we carried out, Minister Jayawickrama asked me to come to Parliament on Tuesday (June 7). In front of many government officials he verbally abused me for carrying out the raid and producing the suspect before court and not before the police. He also asked me to apologise to Minister Sajith Premadasa, but he (Minister Premadasa) was not present in Parliament at that time. I phoned DG Pilapitiya and told him what happened. He told me that as the WLCD Director General, if he could not defend his officers he was not suitable to hold the post any longer and that he would resign from the post. The DG told me that it was a time I should have been commended for catching the poachers. I later submitted my request for a transfer to the ministry, ?Suranga said.
?These allegations are absolute rubbish: Minister Sajith Premadasa
Responding to the claims, Minister Sajith Premadasa said that he refuted all these haphazard allegations, because he was an animal lover from childhood and that he frequently was to Yala sanctuary for the purpose of wild life photography.
?These allegations are absolute rubbish. As an animal lover and I stand against anti-animal activities. I was the one who advised on controlling poaching activities in the Yala National Park. I only want to encourage Wild Life officials in order to protect wild life in our country,? Minister Premadasa said.
He went on to say that he had never violated or intervened in any established rules and regulations of the Wild Life Department of Sri Lanka.
Speaking about the apologising incident, he said he was not even aware of such a thing.?
There was no pressure exerted by me or any minister; Wildlife Minister?
While refuting all the claims levelled by the Yala Park warden and the WLCD official who spoke to the Daily Mirror, the Minister had a different story to tell.
?There was no pressure exerted by me or any minister on the Wild Life officials. Dr. Pilapitiya was an honest and straight forward officer capable of working as the head of the WLCD. I refused to accept his resignation also. I informed the Prime Minister about this. He assured me that he would have a word with Dr. Pilapitiya,?
When asked about the ?main reason? for the resignation of Dr. Pilapitiya, the minister said he only
asked the Yala Park warden to meet him on Tuesday at the Parliament Complex to advise him over not producing the suspect in the June 5 raid to the police before presenting him to court.?
?Allegations are baseless. I should categorically say that an involvement of Minister Sajith Premadasa as alleged did not happen. As a Cabinet Minister and Hambantota being his electorate he has a right to visit the Yala Park. One reason for that is because he is a wild life lover. I don?t think it is fair to point fingers at him based on that. That is not wrong,?
Poaching Mafia operational in?wildlife parks
Commenting on the racket of animal poaching, the Minister Jayawickrama also said such a mafia is in operation in forests belonging to the WLCD and that he was concerned about the issue. He also said he spoke to the Acting IGP S. M. Wickremesinghe and requested him to carry out an investigation into the June 05 incident through the Criminal Investigations Department (CID) to apprehend those behind the racket.
Secretary, Ministry of Sustainable Development and Wildlife R.M.D.B. Meegasmulla said the ministry is to discuss with Dr. Pilapitiya and a decision to re-appoint him to the post is yet in abyance.
A protest urging the authorities to re-appoint Dr. Pilapitiya to the post was launched yesterday by the WLCD staff in Battaramulla. A meeting with the Prime Minister and Dr. Pilapitiya also took place yesterday at the Prime Minister?s residence. Attempts to hear the outcome of the meeting Dr. Pilapitiya?s views failed because he had switched off his mobile phone and was not willing to speak to the media regarding the issue.
