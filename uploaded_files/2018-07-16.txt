A case for  International Relations education  in Sri Lanka
	
This article attempts to use the case of American geo political leadership and its current role in both as the disrupt and creator of global conditions, the focus is on international cooperation through international groupings. The case is made highlighting the emerging complex global relations as a result and the need to create a Sri Lankan citizenry through a robust International Relations education strategy preparing future generations to face and manage global disruptions.
To highlight the importance of such education, two mini case studies of political groupings created during the Cold war by the United States and their current plight are discussed. The focus is on North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) which is an international alliance led by the United States and secondly the Rim of the Pacific Exercise (RIMPAC) a biennial military exercise in the Pacific Ocean conceived by the United States.
Trump on NATO
NATO is a more robust institutional arrangement that is a hard power aggregator and has been the key proponent of strategic bulwark against the Soviet led communist bloc. On the contrary RIMPAC has evolved from being a strategic military exercise to be a soft power projection mechanism of the United States.
The importance of the analysis on how the current President of the United States is on a warpath with its traditional allies in NATO while RIMPAC has attracted significant support and enthusiasm from the same administration. Many American and European analysts use a common concept to explain Trump administration?s foreign and security policy, as ?Incoherence?, they use the term ?incoherent foreign policy? and ?strategic incoherence?.
?Strategic incoherence? seems to be the ideal term to explain our domestic political alignments and constellations, yet the changes in global geo political alliances do have significant impact on countries like Sri Lanka which is already subjected to significant pressure as a result of regional and global great power rivalries.
?
"NATO is a more robust institutional arrangement that is a hard power aggregator and has been the key proponent of strategic bulwark against the Soviet led communist bloc"
Reading through security related documents, reports analysis coming from the Trump administration, there are some consistencies, which are mainly directed at questions of how to contain, and at the same time work with China. There seem to be idiosyncrasies on dealing with Russia.?
Dealing with Russia has divided consensus in Washington at many layers from academic, think tanks, politicians in both democratic and republican parties and the emerging conservative and socialist groups who are gaining influence in the American political system.?
The most telling of these is Trump?s tweets and one liners in his campaign speeches on NATO, a few weeks back at a political rally in North Dakota late last month, President Trump said ?Sometimes our worst enemies are our so-called friends and allies.? This was unprecedented coming from a US president who was about to attend a meeting of NATO leaders.?
?
"Many American European analysts use a common concept to explain Trump administration?s foreign and security policy, "
Trump, even prior to his election was very keen that NATO partners had to commit at least a 2% of their respective GDPs as a financial commitment to the alliance. He was critical that the European partners were not standing by their promise and thus free-riding while America did the heavy lifting.?
Here is a great lesson for any student of geo politics and strategy on the downside of applying a financial benchmark to alliances. Though the allies may have not managed to make the financial commitment they continue to contribute to NATO missions and support the United States in many of its security roles across the globe.?
The best example is France, though it is not meeting the 2% of the French GDP contribution to NATO it is committing troops and military assets into many theatres that do have significant strategic interests for the United States from the Middle East to North Africa, many European military still maintain many weapons platforms that are of American make and are inter-operable giving the United States military industrial complex a significant staying power and providing the US military of a strategic advantage over Russia.
Russia?s moment
Trump?s ambiguity on Russia seems to be one of the greatest undermining factors for the longevity of the alliance. As many are aware of words of first Chief of Staff under Winston Churchill who later served as NATO secretary-general, Hastings Ismay. He proclaimed that the NATO was setup ?to keep the Russians out, the Americans in, and the Germans down.? Though it is not the official motto of the alliance, Ismay?s conceptualization serves as the unofficial driving thread of NATO since its inception.?
Trump seems to be undermining this long term working principle when he is unleashing a barrage of verbal hits on the alliance, making his allies feel extremely uncomfortable while he is reluctant to undermine Putin, thus the Americans are fearing that Trump has given space for Putin to be seen as an equal player when it came to the strategic equilibrium.?
?
"Trump, prior to his election was keen that NATO partners had to commit 2% of their respective GDPs as a financial commitment to the alliance"
NATO allies are worried of the continual American draw down from strategic European spaces.? There are no American Corps forward bases in Europe no logistical support services, Britain has pulled out its troops from Germany, Germany has downsized its military strength significantly since cold war from nearly ten heavy divisions to two at the moment.?
Russia meanwhile has managed to build a sphere of influence around its borders not only with its acquisitions from Ukraine, it has significant support from countries like Hungary and Poland. This article is not attempting to say what Russia is down as wrong but Russia has managed to assert itself in a global stage to certain extent thanks to the incoherence of strategic decision making in the United States.?
Russian sales of the sophisticated S 400 anti-air missile systems to Turkey has made further complications within the NATO alliance, where the alliance purchases weapons systems that are inter-operable and are not of Russian origin. Thus American strategy of incoherence is met with a Russian strategy of coherence and resilience.?
RIMPAC?s relevance?
The RIMPAC exercise which was originally an attempt to thwart Society influence in the Pacific theatre was originally launched by the United States in 1971 with Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the UK. Today it has expanded into the world?s largest multilateral military maritime exercise which is held for the 26th year this year and is featuring 26 nations and about quarter million troops from all contributing nations. The Americans have uninvited China this year based on ongoing tensions and have kept the Russians out since 2014.?
?
"RIMPAC exercise which was originally an attempt to thwart Society influence in the Pacific theatre"
Trump Administration is pouring in troops, assets and seems to have no problems in funding this exercise and with the voracious appetite for military hardware the Asian states seem to have no problems in modernizing their military thus are spending lavishly to that end. While this exercise is a clear message to China about the United States ability to garner the support and at the same time able to lead Asian nations it seems to be entering a phase for a competition for Asia?s leadership.?
Nations that are participating in RIMPAC such as Malaysia,Philippines and Indonesia all have clearly managed to develop foreign policies that do not necessarily align with the United States or but have been smart enough to create foreign policies that enable them to work with both United States and China.?
Towards a globally aware Sri Lanka
From a Sri Lankan perspective observing how United States is dealing with Russia, China and America?s increasing commitments in Asia and the fact that all these are taking place in the context of an ?incoherent strategic compulsion? it is challenging countries like ours to create foreign relations that can manoeuvre in such complex geo political arrangements.?
American global engagement with Donald Trump is starting to create ruptures and disruptions in a global order that was manageable, the ripple effects may take some time to hit us but we should not live and hope to pretend they will not come to our shores, thus Sri Lanka needs a set of policy makers, institutions and academics that have to understand to respond to these shifts and help the country to navigate through the fall out.?
?
"Russian sales of sophisticated S 400 anti-air missile systems to Turkey made complications within NATO alliance"
International relations education needs to streamline soon into our school systems and University systems should have more departments for study and research of global politics.?
Intelligence community, state intelligence analysts need to be brought up to speed of Global transformations, power shifts and with updated tools of analysis our ability to face the future depends on the nurturing of this human capital.

## Title: A Glass of Fresh Milk

A Glass of Fresh Milk
	
?
ri Lanka is considered a lower middle income country by its donors, but many of its children remain hungry. In some schools that I visited in the North, teachers told me that a noticeable number of children are motivated to come to school because of the mid-day meal. Some children they say, even take a part of their lunch for those hungry at home.? ? ?
After the war, the World Food Programme and the Government have had many such school meal programmes in the North. Worryingly, there are reports that suggest such mid-day school meal programmes in the North are to be reduced.?
The need for state nutritional programmes for children is not limited to the North, rather, it is a national problem. The Demographic Health Survey 2016 measuring children under the age of five claims 17% of children are stunted (short for their age), 15 % are wasted (thin for their height) and 21 % are underweight (thin for their age). So, just when Sri Lanka is congratulated for its lower- middle income status due to its higher per capita GDP, the nutritional state of children is shameful for a country with historically high human development indicators despite low per capita GDP.?
In this context, there is recent positive news that the Government is considering a national programme to provide all primary school children with a daily supply of 150 ml of milk. Indeed, when it comes to the nutrition of school children, this would be a welcome initiative.?
I discuss below the production and distribution of milk, as a holistic approach to nutrition and related livelihoods, which are necessary for sustaining such initiatives. I draw on an ongoing study and initiative by the co-operative movement in the North, to both strengthen the dairy sector and contribute towards nutrition in the region.
Milk production
Increasing production of milk towards becoming self-sufficient has been a priority of national policy for some time. However, national supply is far below demand. National milk production in 2016 was 450 million litres of cow and buffalo milk, but an additional 728 million litres of milk and milk-based products were imported to a value of Rs. 36,338 million to meet demand. The Ministry of Health recommends a daily milk intake of 200 ml per person, translating to an annual production target of 1,500 million litres for the population of 20.5 million. With increasing demand for milk, even as local milk production has been increasing, the share of national imports of milk and milk-based products have risen from 53% to 62% from 2013 to 2016.?
?
"The proposed new initiative to provide liquid milk to all schoolchildren will be a major boost for not only nutritional enhancement, but also to propagate the culture of liquid milk consumption"
If we take the Northern Province, in 2016 annual milk production was 39 million litres, contributing 8% to national milk production. Approximately 60% of all milk produced in the North was formally collected, the balance being used for household consumption or sold informally to local shops and consumers. The total annual consumption of milk and milk-based products in the North is approximately Rs. 5 billion. However, Rs. 3.5 billion or 70% of such dairy consumption is in the form of powdered milk with lower nutritional value at higher cost and ultimately resulting in lower levels of nutritional intake for children. The issue in the North as in the rest of the country is the lack of both distributional and refrigeration facilities as well as problematic propaganda resulting in the widespread consumption of milk powder.?
In this context, the proposed new initiative to provide liquid milk to all schoolchildren will be a major boost for not only nutritional enhancement, but also to propagate the culture of liquid milk consumption. Initial discussions for this milk programme lean towards the distribution of UHT milk packets, which can remain unrefrigerated for six months. While such unrefrigerated milk packets can be convenient for distribution, it may not be the best solution for sustaining production, distribution and increasing the consumption of milk in the rural and milk producing districts of the North, and for that matter many other parts of the country.
Livelihoods and consumption
The dairy sector in the North is an important avenue for livelihoods and income generation. In the Vanni districts in particular, many households have cattle, and as with the dairy sector around the world, co-operatives play an important role in the collection and distribution of milk. Therefore, with a major programme as with the distribution of milk to all primary school children, a daily demand of 15,000 litres of milk can be created by the approximately 100,000 primary school children living in the Northern Province. In other words, this programme will create a daily demand for approximately one fifth of the milk formally collected in the region.?
I would argue that if fresh milk consumption has to become part of our way of life, milk production and distribution, have to be linked to the local community. With the network of dairy co-operatives in the North for example, whose members are the parents and relatives of the children who are going to be served with such milk, the collection and distribution of such milk should be done locally.?
One worrying aspect of the proposed school milk programme currently being formulated is that it is large corporations with the capacity to produce UHT milk who are likely to be contracted to distribute 150 ml milk packets purchased at a fixed price of Rs. 21. Alternatively, if local co-operatives are given the opportunity to distribute either fresh milk or refrigerated pasteurized milk packets, they can either supply it for lower costs of say Rs 15 or increase the incomes of local farmers by supplying at Rs. 21.?
Nutritional enhancement is necessarily a long-term initiative. And the Government?s investment in this school milk programme for primary schoolchildren is one in tune with the legacy of free education, which is one of the major strengths of our society. However, both nutrition and education are very much tied to the state of our communities and their livelihoods. When poverty increases both nutrition and education suffer. Would it not be prudent then to ensure that progressive initiatives such as this milk programme for primary school children utilizes local production and distribution, and in the process create a culture of fresh milk consumption?

Death penalty: EU writes to President raising concerns
	
The delegation of the European Union in Sri Lanka as well as the diplomatic missions of Canada and Norway have written to President Maithripala Sirisena to verify the worrying information in the public domain about the intention of the Sri Lankan government to resume implementing the death penalty after a moratorium of more than 40 years.
These diplomatic missions have made known in their letter that they strongly and unequivocally oppose capital punishment in all circumstances and in all cases.
Issuing a statement, the EU Embassy in Colombo said the death penalty is incompatible with human dignity, does not have any proven deterrent effect, and allows judicial errors to become fatal and irreversible.
The diplomatic missions have requested the President to maintain the moratorium on the implementation of the death penalty and to uphold Sri Lanka's tradition of opposition to capital punishment.
The diplomatic missions that wrote this letter are the delegation of the European Union, the British High Commission, Embassies of France, Germany, Netherlands,Romania, High Commission of Canada and the Norwegian Embassy.

Despite a few protesters, majority attended Jaffna meeting: OMP
	
The Office on Missing Persons (OMP) today said a majority of the family members whose loved?ones?went missing and disappeared, attended the OMP meeting held in Jaffna on Saturday despite a few members protesting outside.
Families of the missing and disappeared from the Divisional Secretariat areas of Delft, Kayts, Velanai, Karainagar, Jaffna, Nallur, Uduvil, Chankanai, Sandilipay, Tellippalai, Kopay, Chavakachcheri, Karaveddy, Point Pedro and Maruthankerny attended the meeting held at the Veerasingham Hall in Jaffna.
When the meeting was underway with the participation of OMP Commissioners, some protesters had attempted to obstruct the meeting.
OMP Chairman Saliya Pieris said close to 1,000 family members attended the meeting while a few protested outside.
?Those who were protesting outside were also families of the missing,?who are disappointed?and wanted prompt actions. The OMP is a permanent institution unlike other entities which were there in the past,? he told Daily Mirror.
However, he said only a few families attended the meeting held at the Co-operative Council in Kilinochchi on Sunday as many people were protesting outside the hall.
The next OMP meeting will be held on August 4 and 5 in Batticaloa to share OMP's organisational plan and strategies and also to obtain people's views to incorporate suggestions on the OMP structure and operations. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

From Beddegama to Trincomalee: Are we stuck in an  artistic groove?
	
FILM REVIEW - BURNING BIRDS
?
evena Vihangun? (Burning Birds) is Sanjeewa Pushpakumara?s first feature film and has won several international awards. The director says that the story is based on real-life incidents in the Trincomalee district where he grew up. In reviewing this film, however, we must go beyond the analysis of a film to a soul-searching discussion about the nature of Sri Lankan society and culture, which are the direct sources of themes for artistes, be they filmmakers, writers, dramatists, painters or other.??
The story is the tragedy of one very poor village woman. It can be seen as a tragedy of our country because everything that happens to this woman is the direct result of poverty and political violence, which claims the life of her husband. It is related too, to the failure of our governments to uplift the lot of the poor, especially the rural poor, no matter what statistics say about national growth or median incomes.??
Even beggary can thrive only in cities. A village can?t sustain beggary. It has little to offer to as paid work. Anoma Janadari plays a woman who struggles to feed a family of ten (eight children and her mother in law) after her husband, the village fish vendor, is abducted and killed by a death squad as a JVP suspect. Even if it was possible to beg, she is too proud to do that and prefers to do back-breaking work in a stone quarry. But she is forced to work in a slaughterhouse when the quarry closes down after an accident.??
From that point, the story of sexual exploitation is added to the familiar tale of economic misery, as she undergoes horror after horror ? lured into prostitution, gang-raped, arrested and jailed, while her children are expelled from their school and the family forced to leave the village.??
Sexual exploitation of women is a recurring theme in our cinema and in fiction. It is there, in various guises, from Leonard Woolf?s Village in the Jungle to Dharmasiri Bandaranaike?s film adaptation of Simon Navagattegama?s novel Suddilage Kathawa.?
"If we consider the fiction first, I can?t think any other literature which has produced works with this particular theme (sexual exploitation of poverty-stricken women) with such consistency over such a long time span"
If we take the time frame, Village in the Jungle was first published in 1913, during the colonial era. The story is a classic study of an individual (Silindu) against an unjust system, but Woolf correctly identified the plight of attractive, poverty-stricken village women who become targets of sexual desire by men in positions of power and wealth. Lester?s film version was screened in 1980.??
Navagattegama?s novel was set in the 1950s, after independence but within a structure which is still colonial and feudal in nature, with elements of nascent capitalism. Dharmasiri?s film version of this story was released in 1984 when free-market capitalism was only five years old in the country but sweeping ahead like a juggernaut made of rupees and cents.??
If we now take Devena Vihangun released this year, this is a time span of 105 years (from 1913-2018). If we consider the fiction first, I can?t think any other literature which has produced works with this particular theme (sexual exploitation of poverty-stricken women) with such consistency over such a long time span.??
I am not an authority on world literature (including Latin American, African, and the rest of Asia) and I made the above statement to the best of my knowledge. This does not claim to be a comprehensive survey but I?d like to make a general outline based on my knowledge. The sexual exploitation/violence theme no longer has the same currency in Western literature, though it occurs in some Latin American fiction, for example in the work of Isabel Allende. I am referring to quality fiction, not pulp focused on sex crime and revenge themes.??
Thomas Hardy?s Tess of the d?Urbervilles,the story of an attractive but poor village girl cynically seduced and sexually abused by her rich, playboy cousin was first published in 1891 (Roman Polanski?s film version came in 1980) and was attacked by prurient Victorian critics. Already by the 1920s, however, D. H. Lawrence was exploring the clash of sexuality and ego between men and women on more or less equal terms. In his Lady Chatterley?s lover (1928), the roles are reversed. The woman is rich and powerful, the man a servant in her husband?s estate. But the theme is mutual sexual attraction and unequal love, not sexual exploitation or abuse.??
In American literature, there are examples such as short story writer Flannery O? Conner who provide an exception to the rule. Sexual abuse of female slaves was common during the slavery years, but Afro American writers have tackled this theme only randomly.??
19th Century speaker and reformer Harriet Jacob wrote of her sexual relationships with a white man as a black slave in her autobiography, but hers? is not a tale of abuse. In Richard Wright?s novel, The Native Son a black youth kills a white woman by mistake. But it?s not a sexual crime. Among modern writers, postmodernist Gayl Jones wrote about sexual abuse of black women by a Brazilian plantation owner.
Director Sanjeewa Pushpakumara (left) at the location
William Faulkner, who was white, explored racial bias and conflict in the ?deep south? in some of his fiction. In Ernest Hemingway?s For Whom the Bell Tolls,Maria is raped by the Falangists, but the reasons are political and the story happens in Spain during a civil war. Sexual violence and kidnapping occur in American thrillers (such as No Orchids for Miss Blandish by James Hadley Chase) but that genre is outside this survey.??
Today, the US ranks first among Western countries most dangerous to women, but American literature (and the movie industry) has largely bypassed this issue. Again, I am talking about the serious stuff. Django Unchained, Quentino Tarantino?s 2012 movie, is one exception but the movie industry has a different take regarding this issue.??
In Russian classical literature, we hardly find any serious exploring of this bleak theme. In a short story by Alexander Pushkin, a peasant watches helplessly as his beautiful daughter is kidnapped by a rich nobleman. After many years, he traces her to the nobleman?s St. Petersburg home. Peeping through a window one night, he discovers that she is now married to the nobleman and is living happily, and decides to return home quietly (a happy ending). The only modern Russian writer who made sexual abuse a key element of a major novel is Boris Pasternak ? in Dr. Zhivago,when the ruthless opportunist Komarovsky rapes Lara, and tells her cynically: ?Don?t call this rape, my dear. That would only flatter us both.???
?
"The problem isn?t endemic, but it?s durable. Both Western Europe and North America began moving away in the 19th century from mass level poverty thanks to industrialization (and colonialism, in the case of Europe)"
That doesn?t mean that sexual abuse and exploitation of poor women didn?t exist in pre-industrial England or pre-revolutionary Russia (Dr. Zhivago was first published in 1957, and the story is set just before the revolution). But writers (and filmmakers) somehow didn?t feel the need to bring up the subject so much, and the reasons for that merit a separate discussion. In the West, at any rate, some publishers now refuse to look at manuscripts which include rape.??
The point here is our writers and filmmakers have treated sexual abuse of women (or women becoming victims of male lust) as a serious theme from 1913 to 2018. Anyone analyzing these and other works (the theme of kidnap and/or sexual abuse and violence is there in countless Sinhala commercial films, from Handapana to Hiawatha Neththo and Rajagedara Paraviyo) is bound to conclude that this particular pathology is endemic to Lankan culture. One can argue that only three works of artistic quality are cited, but the important thing is not the numbers but the time frame ? it?s a storyline that has been sustained for more than a century.??
The problem isn?t endemic, but it?s durable. Both Western Europe and North America began moving away in the 19th century from mass level poverty thanks to industrialization (and colonialism, in the case of Europe). That modern Western literature and film-making have moved away from this theme doesn?t mean that sexual exploitation doesn?t exist in Western Europe or the United States. As proof, you only have to look at the post Harvey Weinberg scenario in the US and the luring of women from Africa,Asia and the former Soviet bloc into Western Europe as sex workers or slaves. The root cause of the latter case, in any case, is poverty, and that is the reason why what Woolf saw in Beddegama is still valid in 2018 in the nameless eastern district village that filmmaker Sanjeewa Pushpakumara focuses on. Despite all the bright statistics, many people are still desperately poor.??
That is our endemic problem. Add to this the periodic political instability, and we have a recipe for personal tragedy. President Maithripala Sirisena was the chief guest at the film?s premiere at the Regal. His government, just like our previous governments, has failed to uplift the masses above poverty. But, if he has any conscience, he should consider taking action at least on the following areas.??
?
"The story is the tragedy of one very poor village woman. It can be seen as a tragedy of our country because everything that happens to this woman is the direct result of poverty and political violence, which claims the life of her husband"
Dismantle the shadowy paramilitary apparatus responsible for political kidnappings and death squad murders. It still exists, and his government has done nothing about it.??
Create a stable climate for investment and development which will eliminate the kind of dire rural poverty reflected in this film. It?s nothing new. If we set Woolf?s Beddegama in a contemporary setting,Silindu and his daughters might have a cheap Chinese TV or DVD player, but they?d still be very poor.??
Moderate his hardline views on laws related to sexuality, and sex-related activities. He should recognize the plight of Sri Lankan sex workers and push for legislation that gives them a measure of legal protection.??
Director Sanjeewa Pushpakumara says the film is partly autobiographical. He comes from a family of eight children. But the story is a blend of fact and fiction. The central characters ? the school principal who cynically betrays the fish vendor, the slaughterhouse owner, the widowed young woman who finally becomes a sex worker to feed her children ? all these are characters who sound authentic and familiar.??
Woolf?s characters too, maybe based on real life, as Village In the Jungle has been called a folkloric novel. Simon?s Suddiis a different kind of woman than Sanjeewa Pushkumara?s cinematic character who struggles to remain faithful to the memory of her late husband. Suddi is a more full-blooded character who may actually enjoy sex, which isn?t an unpardonable sin. Transported in time to the eastern province village of Devena Vihangun, she would have consented to the slaughterhouse owner?s advances in the interests of her family. This is neither criticism nor praise, simply a comparison of personality, psychology and body chemistry. I just want to point out that in our writing the sexuality of the women characters has been largely overlooked, overshadowed by themes of exploitation and violence.??
But Suddi?s tragedy too, is finally rooted in her poverty. That really is the bottom line in all three tragedies, and we have been socially, economically and artistically stuck in this groove from 1913-2018 is damning evidence of the failure of our politics to make the country prosperous.??
The director manages to extract excellent performances from his cast, including Anoma Janadari as the tragic mother of eight, Samanalee Fonseka as hier elder daughter and Mahendra Perera as the slaughterhouse owner. The sparse soundtrack reflects the bleakness and harshness of these lives, and Nilendra Deshapriya?s dark palette never releases us from the film?s ominous mood.??
The film is a French-Dutch-Qatar-Sri Lankan co-production. The original script was written by the filmmaker, but was further developed with Jacques Acqoti at the Sam Spiegel International Script Lab in Israel.??

Gaza ceasefire largely holding after day-long flareup
	
?
A ceasefire between Israel and Gaza?s dominant Hamas Islamists appeared largely to be held on Sunday, ending the most intensive flare-up in violence around the Palestinian enclave since a 2014 war.
In a day of fierce fighting on Saturday, Israel carried out dozens of air strikes in Gaza, killing two teenage boys, and militants fired more than 100 rockets across the border, wounding three people in a southern Israeli town.
The ceasefire, the second between the two sides to be brokered by Egypt this year after a previous day-long flare-up in May, came into force late on Saturday.
?Everyone understands that unless the situation is defused, we will very quickly be back to another confrontation,? U.N. envoy Nickolay Mladenov told reporters at his office in Gaza.
Israel said that in the initial hours of the ceasefire militants fired two rockets across the border, of which one was intercepted by its Iron Dome system. There were no reports of an Israeli counter-attack in Gaza, two mortar bombs were fired towards Israel, which responded by striking the launch tube, the military said.
Weekly clashes at the Israel-Gaza border have kept tensions at a high for months. More than 130 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli forces during protests at the frontier held every week since March, including a teenager on Friday, Gaza medics said. There have been no Israeli fatalities.
Israel says Hamas has been orchestrating the demonstrations, dubbed The Great March of Return, to provide cover for militants? cross-border attacks. Hamas denies this.
?Our policy is clear: We hit with great might anyone who harms us,? Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told his cabinet on Sunday. ?I hope that they (Hamas) have gotten the message. If not, they will yet.?

GMOA urges parliamentarians to test urine for glyphosate
	
The Government Medical Officers? Association (GMOA) today urged all parliamentarians to test their urine for residues of the herbicide glyphosate in their system.
Addressing a press conference GMOA Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge said the Government should follow the precedent of the European Parliament which has called for glyphosate to be fully banned by 2022, amid fears the weed killer causes cancer.
The European Green party voted on a resolution objecting the commission's plans to re-approve the substance in Europe, after it was confirmed that over 150 EU parliamentary members tested positive for glyphosate.
He said that the first urine sample should be taken from Plantation Industries Minister Navin Dissanayake and for the sake of the country, the GMOA would bear the cost for testing all the samples.
The GMOA today criticized a gazette notification of the Registrar of Pesticides dated 11 July 2018, which lifted the ban on glyphosate for all crops throughout the country, stating it went beyond the original Cabinet decision to ban the herbicide.
Dr. Aluthge urged the President to reveal all individuals and multinational companies who were part of lifting the glyphosate ban.
The GMOA also called for the immediate resignation of the Registrar of Pesticides for his allegedly irresponsible and arbitrary decision.
In a separate note, GMOA Assistant Secretary Dr. Samantha Ananda said that the adjournment debate is to be held over the Singapore Free Trade Agreement (FTA) in Parliament tomorrow and all public representatives who love the country should oppose the FTA. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

## Title: If we value art and culture, we must support  Basic Income
## Section: News Features
## Date: 16 July 2018 12:01 am
If we value art and culture, we must support  Basic Income
	
It?s a tough world out there for artists. Sustainable support for the arts has been literally non-existent in the past, in Sri Lanka.?
There is a general feeling that stage artists and other forms of art aren?t worth paying for because the gains for the society cannot be computed in monetary terms. In other words the jobs in theatre, drama and the like are not marketable jobs and the artists are more or less pushed into a corner where they have to self-fund productions or spend valuable time fundraising which they would have otherwise spent on creating their artistic productions.?
What this means in real terms is that the one who should have been an artist is forced to become the creative entrepreneur thus changing not only the creative process, but also the character of the art that is produced.? ?
"Basic Income Sri Lanka (BISL) has been working with artists in the theatre world and has initiated a study to explore the effects of Basic Income on their lives"
Ruwanthi de Chickera and Tracy Holsinger, two of the leading dramatists in the country, lead two very significant groups of artists who have produced very remarkable productions that are transforming, educative and informative. Stages Group and Mind Adventure Group are known for their critiquing without criticizing: Their innovative commentary on social issues through the medium of theatre has been an explorative experience for the youth. Their contribution is valuable to art and culture in this country. But the artists, despite their dedication to this art form find themselves in an income trap that they cannot overcome.? ?
Uncertainty plagues them at every step because income is rarely stable even at the best of economic climates. As the whole economy becomes more unstable, the situation gets worse for the average artist who finds it hard to depend on the craft to survive.? ?
"There is a general feeling that stage artists and other forms of art aren?t worth paying for because the gains for the society cannot be computed in monetary terms"
Another concern expressed by the artists at workshops organised by Basic Income Sri Lanka (BISL) is the lack of recognition of the artist?s work as a ?proper job?. The general perception of the theatre art as a hobby makes it necessary for the artists to look for ?real jobs? that give them the image of being gainfully employed thus forcing them to do unfulfilling work to earn the needed cash.? ?
Many more issues were presented by the artists who showed their predicament as being financially vulnerable. There must be a better way to support artists so they can be free to create the works they feel are essential; not just those that will be popular with consumers and donors.? ?
Artists and their unique issues, when studied in earnest, it becomes clear that there needs to be patronage at the state level for art and culture: It becomes obvious that the best solution is to adopt a Basic Income policy which will cover the basic costs of living of the artists. This will give the freedom to the artists to bypass the market, allowing them to choose their message, to create pieces that communicate ideas that might even challenge prevailing socio-political mind sets. A Basic Income supports the choice of artists to be independent to produce and distribute their work on their own terms.? ?
The financial security of the basic income frees them from worry and anxiety and gives them the space to become more imaginative and creative and makes them become socially relevant. A Basic Income would be a transformative policy shift that would not only grant stability and freedom from the income trap, but lead to a thriving cultural sector.? ?
Basic Income Sri Lanka (BISL) has been working with artists in the theatre world and has initiated a study to explore the effects of Basic Income on their lives. The study has selected two of the artists together with a randomized control group and is awarding a Basic Income for 2 years for the two artists. The award ceremony will take place on July 18, 2018 at 4.30 pm at the OPA Auditorium. At this event Dr. Sarath Davala will be the keynote speaker presenting the case of India?s pilot sturdy. He is the coordinator of the India Network for Basic Income (INBI) and will be speaking on ?Emancipatory power of Basic Income. India pilot study and debate.?? ?

MRIA: Proposal before cabinet soon
	
The proposal to develop the Mattala Rajapaksa International Airport (MRIA) into a Public-Private partnership (PPP) with India would be presented to Cabinet shortly, Deputy Minister of Aviation Ashok Abeysinghe said today.
He told a media briefing that Sri Lanka would get a 30 per cent stake of the airport and India the rest.
?Government called for tenders from various countries to find a partner. There were six bids. Some were only interested in using the airport to repair airlines and as the best proposal was from India, we negotiated with them. The Government valuation was $ 326 million. Subsequent to discussions, Although India was originally reluctant, they consented to a share of 70 per cent for India and 30 per cent for Sri Lanka. The government will get a payment equal to 70 per cent of the value and India will bear this loss till it breaks even. This is a win-win situation, as presently the total loss is borne by Sri Lanka. The proposal will be presented to Cabinet shortly and then to Parliament for approval,? the Deputy Minister said.
?Some $ 190 million was borrowed from the Chinese Bank for the Mattala Airport, with an additional spend of $ 39 million. The Sri Lankan government allocated $ 20 million and the total cost has been $ 252 million. The feasibility study was not done in a proper manner. The monthly revenue from the airport was Rs 6.5 million last year whereas the monthly expenditure was as high as Rs. 290 million. Also, we have to pay Rs 1.7 billion per year for debt servicing. Three loan instalments have already been paid out of revenue generated from the Katunayake International Airport. How can we do this for years on end?" he asked.
Loans were obtained for the Hambantota Port and Mattala Airport in 2010. The grace period for Hambantota Port was seven years. Loans have to be settled from 2017. Loan repayments for the Airport have to be repaid from 2015,? he said. (Yohan Perera)

No trust till a hanging is carried out: SF
	
Wildlife Minister Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka on Sunday commented on the death penalty and said he has no trust in the assurance given to hang drug smugglers, until a hanging is carried out.
He expressed these views after visiting the Elephant Conservation Centre at the Lunugamwehera National Park, that spans through 7,000 acres.
Speaking to media, the minister said a number of actions which were said to be taken in the past were not implemented.
?Similar to the polythene and the asbestos ban which were never implemented, I have no faith until I see this for myself. If the death penalty is being implemented, there is no need to select only the convicted who are still engaged in drug smuggling. It doesn?t?matter whether you are inside or out. Action should be taken. I have no trust until it is done. It is commendable, if it happens,? he said. (Aneesha Manage)

On-line bus ticket booking for long distances launched
	
Bus transportation in the country is to undergo significant changes with the launching of online bus ticket booking facility and with the introduction of high-bred and electric buses, Deputy Minister of Transport and Aviation Asoka Abeysinghe said today.
Deputy Minister Abeysinghe said commuters who travel long distances will now have the opportunity of booking bus tickets online through the website www.sltbexpress.lk website and through an app.
He also said the Sri Lanka Transport Board (SLTB) intends importing 500 new buses for $ 20 million under the Indian line of credit. Four hundred 57 seat buses and hundred 35 seat buses will be imported. In addition 1000 low floor buses from Hungary. ?Government is also planning to import 750 high-bred buses and 250 electric buses shortly. High-bred and electric buses will ply by Sinhala New Year 2019.
He also said SLTB made Rs 1.6 billion profit last year for the first time. At the same time, the Minister said SLTB has to bear an additional monthly cost of Rs. 102 million as a result of recent fuel hike. However, he said it is not a loss. He then said there has been no discussion on the bus fare hike yet.
?We have not discussed on a bus fare hike yet. Fuel prices have still not come to the level they were in 2014. Petrol was Rs 157 and diesel Rs 130 a litre at that time. A litre of petrol is Rs 147 currently, the Deputy Minister said
He also said the people will be educated on the proposed fuel price formula shortly. Accepting that fuel prices are adjusted daily in some countries the Deputy Minister said Sri Lanka is not used to such a scenario yet. (Yohan Perera)

Our relationship which was worse, now changed: Trump to Putin
	
US President Donald Trump, speaking alongside Russian President Vladimir Putin at a press conference in Helsinki, Finland, admitted that the relationship between the two countries 'has never been worse' - before adding 'but that changed as of about four hours ago', the Daily Mail reported today.
?We've all been foolish... we've both made mistakes' and that today's summit at the Finnish Presidential Palace was just the beginning of a process of restoring ties, It is in the interest of both of our countries to continue our conversation and we have agreed to do so,?. Trump said, having earlier shot a wink at the Kremlin strongman.
Putin, meanwhile, said he completely trusts Donald Trump and that the feeling was mutual. He said the US and Russia needed to solve problems together and that Moscow was ready for intelligence cooperation with America on terrorism and cyber threats.
In a lighthearted moment, Putin gave Trump a soccer ball from the 2018 World Cup to symbolise North America hosting the tournament in 2026. The US President said his son would like the gift and threw it into the audience - apparently to his wife Melania.
The Russian leader once again denied his country interfered in the 2016 US elections saying that Trump brought the matter up during their talks. U.S. intelligence agencies believe the Kremlin acted to influence the vote, in which Trump won over Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
?I had to repeat that the Russian state never interfered, and does not plan to interfere in internal American electoral process," Putin said, describing the claims as 'complete nonsense'.
He also hailed the 'successful' cooperation between Russian and US security services insisting: 'We are in favour of continuing cooperation in the sphere of the fight against terror and ensuring cyber security.'
Agreeing on the need for increased cooperation Trump said: 'If we are going to solve many of the problems facing our world, we will have to find ways to cooperate.'
He said he had discussed a wide range of critical issues for both countries, including the war in Syria, Iran, global terrorism and nuclear arms control. He also addressed the issue of alleged Russian interference in U.S. elections, he said.
?We made the first steps towards a brighter future, grounded on cooperation and peace,' he said.?Refusing to engage will not accomplish anything,? he said.

Panama Papers exposed leaders, criminals, celebrities... - EDITORIAL
	
ormer Pakistani Premier Nawaz Sharif and his daughter Maryam Nawaz were arrested by National Accountability Bureau (NAB) officials upon their arrival in Lahore on Friday night (13 July), and subsequently whisked away to Islamabad on a chartered flight..? ?
In July 2017, just when Pakistani PM Nawaz Sharif was a year away from becoming the first premier to complete a full term in office, he was ousted. The country?s Supreme Court disqualified him from office and referred the issue of his family?s offshore assets to anti-corruption authorities.??
Former Prime Minister Sharif was sentenced in absentia to 10 years in prison and fined $10.6 million on corruption charges linked to revelations in the 2016 Panama Papers regarding Sharif?s family?s properties overseas.? In April 2016, an International Consortium of Investigative Journalists? (ICIJ) probe based on files leaked from Panamanian offshore provider Mossack Fonseca revealed details of 11.5 million secret files of 140 politicians from more than 50 countries connected to offshore companies in 21 tax havens.? ?
Following investigations after the documents were leaked, Pakistans Anti-Graft Court also sentenced Sharif?s daughter Maryam and his son-in-law Safdar.??
Sharif was sentenced after failing to explain how his family acquired luxury flats in London. The leaked documents showed the Sharif family owned apartments through off-shore companies.? ?
?However Sharif is not the only world leader to be exposed by the ICIJ documents. The documents revealed current and former world leaders in the data include the Prime Minister of Iceland, the President of Ukraine, and the King of Saudi Arabia and a host of others??
Iceland?s Premier Gunnlaugsson was the first political casualty of the Panama Papers -- forced to step down after people took to the streets demanding his resignation.??
Then-British Prime Minister David Cameron?s late father was among those identified in relation to investments set up by Mossack Fonseca. The British PM?s office said the family?s tax affairs were a private matter.? The leak also uncovered a suspected money laundering ring involving close associates of Russian President, Vladimir Putin.??
A close friend of President Putin was put at the top of the offshore empire worth more than $2 billion which has made this circle extremely wealthy. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the reports were aimed at discrediting the Russian President. He also claimed the journalists involved were ?former officials from the (US) Department of State, the CIA and other special services?.? The list does not end here, hidden in 11.5 million secret files of 140 politicians from more than 50 countries connected to offshore companies in 21 tax havens.? ?
Sri Lanka too, found mention in the Panama Papers and there was speculation names of major political players and or other corrupt individuals would be revealed by the government which was elected to power on an anti-corruption ticket.? ?
Deputy Minister of Public Enterprise Development Eran Wickramaratne, said at that time, the names of Sri Lankan politicians and companies featured in the Panama Papers and revelations would soon be made.? ?
Addressing the Media at the Government Information Department on April 7, he said the ?Panama Papers? exposure may help divulge important information regarding local politicians and their friends and relatives whose accounts were circulated through banks in Seychelles and Dubai earlier.??
However, despite two long years having passed, we have yet to hear of Sri Lankan politicians or corporates having been investigated regarding revelations made in the Panama Papers.? ? Nor is it surprising that, Sri Lanka?s then Central Bank Chief Arjuna Mahendran -- infamous for his role in the country?s billion $ bond scam scandal -- in an interview carried in the ?Daily Mirror? saying ?...the authenticity of the so-called leaks was doubtful and therefore, couldn?t reveal any names of individuals, due to privacy laws...??
As a colleague put it, Sri Lanka?s politicians are incorruptible..., our officials are not tainted by corruption, none of our business leaders or corporates is corrupt.? ?
We are an incorruptible people...??
The lyrics in ?Lankawe ape Lankawe?, sung by the popular group ?Gypsies? in their famous sataire come to mind:? ??Where do you find honest and audacious people?... in Sri Lanka... in Sri Lanka???
?Let the Americans and the British come and learn from us...?
Despite the ?writing on the wall? staring us in the face, we Sri Lankans like to make out that we are pure and Lilly-white, like the national dress leading politicos love to don.? ?

Post-war SL needs to re-establish Commission against illicit arms
	
Sri Lanka has been fighting against the global trafficking arms, drugs and wildlife for some time. During the 30 year war Sri Lanka was unable to fully cope with it. But post-war Sri Lanka is unable to cope with it due to some reasons which can be addressed immediately. These include lack of political will, unwillingness to engage with the international community and lack of human and financial resources availability. Sri Lankan authorities should know that such transnational organized crimes are taking place in the country which cannot be addressed alone without international support.?
Addressing the transnational organized crimes taking place in post-war Sri Lanka should be one of the high priorities for the Government of Sri Lanka (GoSL). Otherwise it will sabotage the ongoing peace and reconciliation efforts and badly impact on the country?s human rights record. Addressing this important issue directly will improve the human security of its citizens. There are seven essential issues associated with human security such as economic security, food security, health security, environmental security, personal security, community security and political security.? ?
Sri Lanka ended its 30-year long armed conflict between the Government Security Forces and the LTTE in 2009. By the end of the war Sri Lanka had almost cleared the threat to national security. But unfortunately post-war Sri Lanka has yet failed to address the issues relating to human security and up until now there are no lasting solutions that have been found to address them. But during the war Sri Lanka had some impressive actions particularly against the illicit small arms. Soon after the war ended in 2009 such initiatives were stopped. Now post-war Sri Lanka is facing a spiral of crime taking place on a daily basis.
?
"Post-war Sri Lanka alone will not be able to eradicate illicit arms trafficking"
National Commission Against Proliferation of Illicit Small Arms (NCAPISA) 2005-2008
Since the establishment of the UN the Programme of Action (PoA) on Small Arms and Light Weapons in 2003 Sri Lanka has actively engaged with the PoA. Sri Lanka carried out certain activities with PoA which benefited Sri Lankans at large and was praised by the international community.? With the support of the international community Sri Lanka established the above-mentioned National Commission Against Proliferation of Illicit Small Arms (NCAPISA) in 2005 under the instructions of President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga.
The NCAPISA with the support of civil society carried out activities including the collection of illicit small arms and light weapons in the country except in the war-torn North and East provinces. It has collected over 35,000 illicit small arms and destroyed them at the Independence Square on the International Gun Destruction Day on July 7, 2005. In 2006, the first Review Conference of the PoA was presided by Sri Lanka which brought honour to the country.? The then Sri Lankan Ambassador to the US Prasad Kariyawasam presided over the Review Conference.?
NCAPISA between November 2006 and April 2007, NCAPISA carried out a survey on the Prevalence of Illicit Small Arms which was the first in the South Asian region. The survey report published in 2008 with important recommendations for the NCAPISA,? Executive and Parliament,? Ministry of Defence, Public Security, Law and Order,? Security Forces,? Police,? Civil Security Department, Ministry of Justice/Attorney General?s Department,? Prisons, Government Analyst, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Health Services, Customs, Departments of Forestry, Agriculture and Wildlife, Ministry of Education, Media and Civil society.
?
"If NCAPISA existed today the country could have avoided certain grave crimes"
De-functioning of NCAPISA and proliferation of illicit arms in post-war SL
The war ended in 2009 at the same time the NCAPISA de-functioned. It was unable to carry out any recommendations mentioned in the 2008 Survey Report of the Commission. Since 2008 up until now neither the Government nor any other party has raised the importance of re-establishment of the NCAPISA in post-war Sri Lanka. If this particular Commission existed today the country could have avoided certain grave crimes. Not only people getting killed but also getting disabled physically or mentally and or both due to such gun violence. Small arms cause 90% of civilian casualties. According to the Sri Lanka?s Police Department crime statistics 35,978 grave crimes were reported in 2017.?
Post-war Sri Lanka is directly or indirectly linked to the illicit trafficking of drugs and wildlife on a daily basis now. These two trades have direct links to illicit arms which is linked to the global arms trade. In other words these three trades have strong linkages and are always interlinked to one another. During and after the war in Sri Lanka, underworld groups, political groups and certain individuals have received various types of small arms through several means. It is believed that the LTTE sold such weapons to the South, military soldiers smuggled them, previous governments distributed weapons to politicians but never collected them and arms were smuggled through the sea and airports and harbours.
Due to the circulation of illicit weapons in post-war Sri Lanka underworld activities such as drug and wildlife trafficking, robbing and burgling businesses, ransom takings, contractual killings, rapes and various other atrocities are soaring on a daily basis with the use of such weapons.
?
"It is unfortunate that since 2009 post-war Sri Lanka did not engage with the UN PoA and the ATT"
Post-war SL should seek international support
Post-war Sri Lanka alone will not be able to eradicate the illicit arms trafficking as mentioned above. The international community has already pledged their support for Sri Lanka on this important matter if Sri Lanka is ready to join with them. Before that Sri Lanka should show genuine commitment towards the matter and should carry out two important acts before engaging with the international community. The Survey Report of the NCAPISA recommended? (page 18) that; the Foreign Ministry should continue to play a strong and active role on behalf of the Sri Lankan Government in strengthening international and regional instruments to control small arms, including the UN PoA and the Arms Trade Treaty (ATT).?
The ATT which came into force in 2014 promotes responsibility, transparency and accountability in the global arms trade. Further this Treaty is critical to stopping weapons falling into the wrong hands thereby fuelling human rights violations. The ATT is particularly concerned about women and children who account for the vast majority of those adversely affected by armed conflict and armed violence. Further, the ATT and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of Agenda 2030 share common goals and purpose.?
It is unfortunate that since 2009 post-war Sri Lanka did not engage with the UN PoA and the ATT. Due to post-war Sri Lanka?s not engaging with these two international instruments the country itself failed to address the issue of proliferation of illicit small arms.? From next year onwards Sri Lanka will start hosting the world?s largest international conferences like the Conference of the Parties (CoP) of the Convention on International Trade on Endangered Species of Fauna and Flora (CITES). The CITES always encourages governments around the world to fight against the illicit arms trade which has a direct link to wildlife poaching. Before the 18 CoP of the CITESSri Lanka as the host country should show commitment on the matter and accede to the ATT.
?
"The war ended in 2009 at the same time the NCAPISA de-functioned. It was unable to carry out any recommendations mentioned in the 2008 Survey Report of the Commission"
Way forward
Post-war Sri Lanka should immediately accede to the ATT and re-engage with the UN PoA programme this year. Engaging with these two international instruments GoSL will be able to receive the necessary technical and financial assistance from the international community and carry out some of the important activities within this year and next year. Those are;
A). Re-establishment of the NCAPISA (Reviewing the previous mandate of the Commission with a new work plan).?
B). Carry out an Island-wide survey on illicit small arms and light weapons?
C). Amend the Firearms (Amendment) Act No 22 of 1996 or have a new Act on Firearms.??
D). Review the recommendations set out in the 2008 Survey Report of the NCAPISA.??
E).Public campaign against proliferation of illicit small arms? ?
F).The security forces recovered small and light weapons from the LTTE and since 2007 authorities recovered illicit arms from people which should be destroyed at a public place.?
This could be organized in parallel to the next year 10th anniversary of ending the war between the LTTE and the Government Security Forces.?
Carrying out such activities will help to improve Sri Lanka?s human rights record and strengthen ongoing peace and reconciliation efforts. Post-war Sri Lanka should look for permanent solutions for the issues concerning human security rather than survive on day-to-day short term political tactics on such important issues.?
If post-war Sri Lanka failed to address issues relating to human security no doubt the country would be heading for a lawless state. Implementation of the death penalty alone will not bring the desired results and that will only bring bad publicity for post-war Sri Lanka.? ?

SL remains a ?Priority Country? in UK HR report
	
Sri Lanka has achieved limited progress in the human rights situation and remains a priority country in the United Kingdom?s Annual Human Rights Report 2017, the British High Commission on Monday said.
In a statement, it said Sri Lanka is one of 30 ?Human Rights Priority Countries? (HRPCs); countries where the UK has serious human rights concerns and hopes to engage positively to develop human rights performance.
Particular concerns highlighted by the report include attacks on minority communities and the slow delivery of key human rights and reconciliation commitments.
?The UK remains concerned by the lack of progress on introducing legislation that protects women and LGBT people from discrimination. The UK works with the government of Sri Lanka to support reconciliation and human rights. This continued engagement aims to strengthen democracy and the rule of law through support for police reform, demining, inter-faith dialogue and mediation and the UN?s Peacebuilding Priority Plan,? the statement said.
The Report underlines the UK?s desire to work positively with countries to help them improve their human rights performance.
The 30 HRPCs are: Afghanistan, Bahrain, Bangladesh, Burma, Burundi, Central African Republic, China, Colombia, Democratic People?s Republic of Korea, Democratic Republic of Congo, Egypt, Eritrea, Iran, Iraq, Israel and the Occupied Territories, Libya, Maldives, Pakistan, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Somalia, South Sudan, Sri Lanka, Sudan, Syria, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Venezuela, Yemen, and Zimbabwe.

Take steps to recall UNHRC resolution on SL
	
Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) Chairman Prof. G.L. Peiris said today he would write to the newly appointed British Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt asking him to take decisive steps to call upon the UNHRC in Geneva to withdraw the resolution on Sri Lanka.
Prof. Peiris who is the former External Affairs Minister told Daily Mirror that Sri Lanka co-sponsored this resolution by the United States which was adopted on October 1, 2015. He said Britain played a major role in getting the support of the European Union member states to it.
?It has now come to light that the basis for this resolution is entirely flawed and based on facts which are untrue,? he said.
He said it came to light after Lord Naseby, a prominent member of the House of Lords, revealed falsity of these facts based upon dispatches from the Defence Attach? of the British High Commission in Sri Lanka and the British Foreign Office, during the wartime.
?It is way off the mark,? he said.
He said Neil Buhne who was in charge of UN operations in Sri Lanka had declared that the Sri Lankan security forces were acting to protect civilians.
?The coordinating committee that included the US, Japan and Britain declared that enough food and medical supplies were sent. Therefore, the resolution should not stand,? he said.
Besides, Prof. Peiris said 70 MPs of the opposition would renew their call against Opposition Leader R. Sampanthan. He said 70 out of the 92 opposition members would sign the letter to be addressed to the Speaker in this regard. (Kelum Bandara)

The Rohingya rape survivors? babies are quietly arriving
	
?
Bangladesh, (Hindustan Times), 15 July 2018 -? More than 10 months have passed since Myanmar?s security forces launched a sweeping campaign of rape and other brutalities against the Rohingya in the Rakhine state, and the babies conceived during those assaults have been born in camps across Bangladesh. For many of their mothers, the births have been tinged with fear ? not only because the infants are reminders of the horrors they survived, but because their community often views rape as shameful, and bearing a baby conceived by Buddhists as sacrilege.??
Pictured rape victim ?M? lies on the floor of her shelter uninterested. With her other pregnancies she excitedly counted the days until delivery she said. this time she felt detatched from the life growing inside her.??
When the infant arrived, she said he looked nothing like her other children. In his eyes she see? her rapists. To look at him is reliving the attacks over and over again.?
