Fitch rates HDFC Bank?s Rs.4bn debenture issue at ?BBB(lka)?
	
		 		 
		 
			
Fitch Ratings has assigned Housing Development Finance Corporation Bank of Sri Lanka?s (HDFC Bank; BBB(lka)/Stable) proposed senior unsecured debentures of up to Rs.4 billion a final National Long-Term Rating of ?BBB(lka)?.
The assignment of the final rating follows the receipt of documents conforming to information already received, and the final rating is the same as the expected ratings assigned on 24 August 2015.
The proposed issuance, which will have tenors of five and 10 years and carry fixed and floating coupons, will be listed on the Colombo Stock Exchange. HDFC Bank expects to use the proceeds to reduce asset and liability maturity mismatches.
The proposed senior debentures are rated in line with HDFC Bank?s National Long-Term Rating. The issues rank equally with the claims of the bank?s other senior unsecured creditors.
The issuer rating is driven by Fitch?s expectation that the bank would receive extraordinary support from the state, if needed, given that the state effectively holds 51 percent of the bank.?
It also reflects Fitch?s view of the bank?s quasi-policy role in supporting the state?s initiatives to develop more housing for low- and middle-income families. However, the potential for state support is lower than for larger state-owned banks in Sri Lanka due to HDFC Bank?s lower systemic importance.

India joins SL probe into ?sexual favours? for houses
	
	The Indian High Commission in Colombo and the Sri Lanka Red Cross Society (SLRCS) have launched a joint investigation into a complaint by a war-displaced widow against a Red Cross official for ?soliciting sexual favours? in return for houses in the Indian government-funded housing project in the country?s northern province.
	As the news about the allegation reached New Delhi last week, an angry South Block took the matter ?extremely seriously?, with Foreign Secretary S Jaishankar immediately asking the Indian High Commission for a joint probe with the SLRCS, top sources told The Indian Express.
	According to sources, Indian High Commissioner Y K Sinha quickly approached the Sri Lankan foreign ministry to ensure that officials ? who are being probed in Sri Lanka ? do not leave the country till the probe is completed.
	?We don?t want the accused officials to escape, so the Sri Lankan foreign ministry and their immigration authorities have been informed,? an Indian official said. Another Indian diplomat said that while there was ?no time-frame?, the probe will be conducted ?expeditiously and thoroughly?.
	?India will not condone any such activity by any of the implementing partners of this project. The Government of India ? through its High Commission in Colombo and the consulate in Jaffna ? is conducting a joint probe along with the Sri Lankan Red Cross officials,? an Indian High Commission spokesperson told The Indian Express from Colombo.
	Sources said? this is the first time that such a complaint had come to India?s notice, and? was taken seriously since PM? Modi had handed over houses to some of the war widows during his visit to Jaffna in March this year.
	These women are called ?war widows? as their husbands were either declared killed or went missing during Sri Lanka?s war with the LTTE, which ended in 2009.
	According to a report in Sri Lanka?s Sunday Times, investigations were initiated after ?a war-displaced widow from Mulankavil lodged a complaint against one of the officials at the Kilinochchi branch of the Sri Lanka Red Cross Society, saying he demanded sexual favours from her in order to approve funds for the construction of her house under the project?.
	The report quoted a spokesperson for the SLRCS, Mahieash Johnney, as saying that the management had called for a probe following a written complaint lodged at the Kilinochchi branch last week.
	While an Indian diplomat told The Indian Express that there was only one complaint so far,? SLRCS Kilinochchi branch secretary Thampu Sethupathy claimed in the Sunday Times report that he had received more than 30 written and verbal complaints regarding demands for sexual favours.
	He added that, based on the sensitivity of the issue, he had forwarded 15 of these complaints to the head office in Colombo.
	?For the last two months we have been getting this kind of complaint from the public, particularly women. Initially, we did not consider this as a serious issue until we received some of the complaints which were very sensitive, with a similar pattern. It was thereafter that we brought this to the attention of the head office,? he said.
	The SLRCS, along with the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), is the implementing partner of? India for the project.
	The project is funded by India and implemented through a MoU with Sri Lanka.

Rupee steady in dull trade; stocks up
	
		 		 
		 
			
REUTERS: The Sri Lankan rupee was trading steady in dull trade yesterday as dollar selling by banks offset importer demand for the greenback, dealers said.
?There is not much happening,? said a currency dealer asking not to be named.
The rupee was unchanged at 140.30/40 per dollar at 0701 GMT.
Dealers said importer dollar demand has reduced following government measures to discourage vehicle imports.
Vehicle imports will drop by at least 90 percent after the government changes the way it calculates the value of certain motor vehicles, officials said on Friday.
The government imposed a 100 percent margin on letters of credit for motor vehicles to discourage unnecessary imports, in a move to prevent dollar outflows and further weakening of the rupee currency.
Some dealers said dollar demand from importers is reducing ahead of the government?s budget in November and some new measures to discourage unnecessary imports.
The rupee hit a record low of 141.40 per dollar on Sept. 28, but has recovered over the past few days due to bank dollar sales which followed dollar selling by a state-run bank.
Sri Lanka?s main stock index was 0.22 percent, or 15.28 points, firmer at 7,111.34 at 0703 GMT. Turnover was Rs.481.4 million ($3.44 million).?

Universities globally are ?organisations that perform a key role within contemporary society by educating large proportions of the population and generating knowledge but many universities have taken action to develop a ?third mission? by fostering links with knowledge users and facilitating technology transfer. The latter is what we are interested in and the private sector tourism chambers- SLITO, THASL and ASMET will be the key stakeholders in the partnership said Athukorala.?
The key issues that were identified and shared at the World Tourism day with the university of Colombo were as follows: - Strategies for better management of traffic in wildlife parks
Are the tourist arrival numbers right - case study in Sri Lanka, Building a destination brand in the digital age, Importance hygiene and sanitation when a country attracts top end visitors, Can Sigiriya the 8th wonder be better marketers. Is casinos the best way to attract the top dollar tourist, the need for the Tourism master plan for Sri Lanka, The HR issue in the hospitality industry of Sri Lanka , Why has the Tourism industry not grown like the tea and apparel industry of Sri Lanka, Do Chinese tourist increase the crime rate in a country - case study of Sri Lanka
Should Sri Lanka focus on Golf Tourism? How to moderate online booking companies operating is Sri Lanka, Halal tourism will it work in Sri Lanka? A structured process of new product development for the tourism industry, What is carrying capacity in the Tourism industry? Is there a future for Charters to work in the Sri Lanka's tourism sector, The relationship between infrastructure development and tourist arrivals in a country just to name a few.
All copy research topics that has been approved by the senate will be available at the Sri Lanka Tourism library so that it can be used by the private sector which I will personally monitor commented Dr Athukorala.

Dr. Rohantha Athukorala at the OPA head quarters addressing the gathering
One of Sri Lanka's top professionals Dr Rohantha Athukorala addressing the Young Professionals Association( OPA) on the topic " Sri Lanka Towards a $100 billion economy" pinioned " Tourism gives a country an opportunity to come out with new ideas, new concepts and dreams which no other discipline can give back to a country. Sri Lanka has got that chance now! It's all about what we do together as coalition governments, coalition public sector boards to make Sri Lanka a $100 billion economy he said.
What is required is for the tourism industry policy makers and private sector to rally closer than ever before and behind their respective tourism brand marketing entities said Chairman Athukorala. Tourism must be a major catalyst for change, for the society as a whole and for this to happen we must invest on people and research. We must develop strategic partnerships linking the Tourism industry with top academia both in Sri Lanka and globally so that Sri Lanka become part of the Global value chain( GVC'c) he said.
Tourism must bring a fresh perspective and access to new ideas, concepts, and dreams" let's make this happen together like what we did the Guinness Book of record attempts where three institutions came together- Sri Lanka Tourism, Sri Lanka Tea Board and Sri Lankan Airlines. The launch of the global on line video completion partnering google, the one million tree stories project partnering Rotary that was launched by Miss World Rolene Strauss, the 500 pod blue whales that live 30 km from Kalpitiya endorsed global specialist Andrew Stutton, Sri Lanka Tourism partnering the Dalada Maligama to create awareness on the 1067th Esela Perahera at the largest tourism fair in the east "Japan Tourism Expo 2015 in Tokoyo", Sri Lanka Tourism together with National Gem and Jewellery Association to auction a " blue sapphire" at the largest tourism fair in Scandinavia " TUR international travel fair 2015 to name a few he voiced.
?Athukorala went on to say that "Growth of the tourism industry offers us a chance to take a step forward and to overcome our differences and capitalize on our diversity to connect Sri Lanka into the global value chain. This is our unique DNA . Let's Make this the best year for Sri Lanka tourism he voiced given that we are focussing on the $ 3 billion tourism receipts for 2015 with $250 + per day so end stacking the numbers he said.
"Let's make the tourism industry the the pillar of our economy, demands that our country and its people work in total partnership with the SME sector that is accounting for 49% of the tourism receipts" he said. It's important that the tourism industry to be together and making the policy makers become market driven."If we seize this chance for growth, then tourism can become a major tool for good and for our future prosperity that will account for 22-24% of GDP like many other developed tourism businesses.
We must keep tourism visible as an industry that brings economic stability, provides employment, and keeps the world connected which is why we launched the global online video competition where a ideal dream vacation branded " 365 day holiday". Meaning twenty lucky winners will get a twenty day holiday with a media link to make the vacation memorable. After all 77% of the travellers make decisions with on line data and hence this competition becomes unique said Athukorala.
As at end August Sri Lanka tourism has recorded a 16.8% growth with 1.1 million visitors coming into the country.

Video: Wildlife Dept. accused of worsening human-elephant conflict
	
The Wildlife Department and several NGOs are worsening the human-elephant conflict instead of seeking solutions, alleged an organisation calling itself the National Movement for the Protection of Domesticated Elephants (NMPDE) today.
Staging a protest outside the Wildlife Resources Conservation Ministry in Battaramulla, the organisation said domesticated elephants had become targets.
?The number of human-elephant conflicts reported have increased rapidly and even some journalists had been attacked while reporting the conflict. As the Department and NGOs are responsible for the issue, they should come up with solutions,? asserted the Ven. Magalkande Sudatha Thera, the head of the movement.
He said reports indicated that about 250 wild elephants were killed annually due to various human activities.
?We will not call off the protest until a permanent solution is given by the minister or the secretary. We will even hold a hunger strike if we are not given a solution,? the Thera said.
The Thera further said they had requested the authorities to register all domesticated elephants, including baby elephants, and to implant a microchip in them with their registration and DNA details. (Indika Sri Aravinda)
