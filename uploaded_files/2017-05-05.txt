Indian troops launch major anti-militant drive in Kashmir
	
?
Thousands of soldiers and paramilitaries were Thursday engaged in a huge anti-militant operation in Indian-administered Kashmir, where armed rebels have repeatedly attacked government forces in recent weeks.
??
Police said government forces had surrounded at least 20 villages in the drive, launched early Thursday in Shopian district in the volatile south of the disputed Himalayan region. ??
??It is an unprecedented operation,? deputy inspector general of police S P Pani told AFP. ??
??It is impossible to capture the militants, but we hope there will be contact (exchange of fire) with them in the course of the day.? Suspected militants are frequently killed in shoot-outs with government forces in Kashmir, but are only rarely captured alive. ??
Witnesses said hundreds of residents came out onto the streets in two villages, Sug and Tarkwangan, during the search operations and threw stones at the soldiers. ?
?
One said soldiers had attacked private homes in his village with sticks?
and rocks. ??
??It was scary. Many houses were damaged,? the villager told AFP by phone, requesting anonymity. ??
Witnesses said army helicopters were hovering above the area as the search operations were going on. ??
Kashmir has been divided between India and Pakistan since the end of British rule in 1947, but both claim the territory in its entirety.

## Title: Judging traits and aptitudes by the Thumb

Judging traits and aptitudes by the Thumb
	
By A.S. Fernando
In the previous article, we discussed the three phalanges of the thumb in some detail. In this article, we propose to discuss the thumb as a whole. According to Indian palmistry experts, the thumb falls into three main categories. They are:
1. Obtuse-angled Thumb
2. Right-angled Thumb
3. Acute-angled Thumb
?
1 ?Obtuse-angled Thumb
This thumb makes an angle between 90 and 180 degrees with the Index Finger. This thumb is long and thin. The person having this thumb is sober and gentle. These persons are often artistes and musicians or those performing some work useful to the society.
These persons, despite a childhood of hardship, would succeed in life due to will-power and perseverance.
However, an unusually long thumb is not considered lucky. If the tip of the thumb extends beyond the second phalanx of the Index Finger, the owner lacks intelligence to make his life a success. If the thumb is not too long and is proportionate, the owner would be an intelligent and pragmatic person and a lover of arts. He would put service to the community before self.
?
?
2 ?Right-angled Thumb
This thumb forms a right angle with the Index Finger. This kind of thumb looks like a pillar and does not lean backwards. The owner of such a thumb believes in working rather than in talking. Such persons dislike gossip. They are hot-tempered, but quickly cool down. They are vindictive. They are either good friends or bad enemies.
Right-angled thumbed people are patriots and are prepared to make the supreme sacrifice for the country. They do not make good subordinates, because they do not like to work under others.
?
3 ?Acute-angled Thumb
This thumb makes an angle of less than 90 degrees with the Index Finger. This thumb is comparatively short. The owner of such a thumb is an uncouth and evil-hearted person who is always in a state of frustration. These persons are lazy and would call it a day when a job of work they undertake, is only half-done. However, they are not lazy when it comes to carrying out an illegal or evil deed. They spend far in excess of their earnings and seek to make money by unfair and unscrupulous means. These persons seek the company of cheap women to satisfy their sexual desires. All in all, a personshaving an acute-angled thumb is not an asset to the society.

Kanchana disassociates himself from JO
	
UPFA Matara District MP Kanchana Wijesekera said today he had decided to temporarily disassociate himself from the joint opposition.
In a Facebook post he said he had no intention of joining the government or the ?Maithri faction? of the SLFP or for that matter any other faction which supports the government.
?This decision was taken to obtain a better perspective of the prevailing situation. I will continue to serve the people of Matara and the mandate given to me,? he said.
In a response to one of the comments, he said his decision is in no way against the joint opposition or former president Mahinda Rajapaksa, but against those who misuse the JO platform in the pursuit of earning more money and against those who support such moves.
?I will never sell my soul for a ministerial post or other perks but will continue to fulfil my duties as a Member of the Opposition,? he said.???

If MP Geetha Kumarasinghe disqualified to be a Member of Parliament due to her dual citizenship, former Central Bank Governor Arjuna Mahendran?s duties should also become null because he is not even a citizen of Sri Lanka, the Joint Opposition (JO) charged yesterday.
The Appeal Court on Wednesday ruled MP Kumarasinghe was disqualified to function as an MP owing to her dual citizenship of Sri Lanka and Switzerland.
Addressing a news conference, MP Bandula Gunawardane said the currency notes signed by Arjuna Mahendran, who holds a Singapore citizenship, might also become null. He said there are several MPs who hold dual citizenship and attempt to conceal theirs.
Meanwhile, Prof. G. L. Peiris said the former CB Governor had not even sworn-in for the post he had held because he was not a Sri Lankan citizen.
He also said Ms. Kumarasinghe will file an appeal in the Supreme Court next week against the Court of Appeal's ruling, and she had already informed the Speaker in this regard through her lawyers. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

Nepal SC stays impeachment motion against first woman CJ
	
The Supreme Court of Nepal on Friday directed the stakeholders not to move forward the impeachment motion against Chief Justice Sushila Karki and immediately reinstate her in the judiciary, the Himalayan Times reported today.
Advocate Sunil Ranjan Singh on Wednesday had filed a writ petition, challenging the impeachment motion that the lawmakers of ruling Nepali Congress and CPN Maoist Centre moved against the Chief Justice on April 30. The hearing on the writ had begun yesterday.
A single bench of Justice Cholendra Shamsher Rana issued a stay order against the move today, observing that the allegations made against Chief Justice Karki were not on a par with the spirit of Nepal?s Constitution.
Referring to the principle of balance of convenience, Justice Rana ordered the defendants to put the impeachment motion and the CJ?s suspension letter on status quo, and let Chief Justice Karki to resume her office from today itself.
While moving the impeachment motion, the Nepali Congress and CPN Maoist Centre had accused Karki of interfering with the government?s executive role in the appointment of Nepal Police Chief and failing to bear her responsibilities impartially and efficiently.
Karki faced an automatic suspension after 249 lawmakers moved the motion against her on April 30.
Subsequently, Gopal Prasad Parajuli was appointed the Acting Chief Justice. He took part in the meetings of Constitutional Council that made nominations in two constitutional bodies?Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority and Office of the Auditor General.
Justice Rana?s order is rife with emotional notes.
?While issuing an interim order as sought by the plaintiff,? he said, ?I feel weak, sad and agitated.?
?Since the day the impeachment motion was registered against the Chief Justice,? he added, ?I have seen direct reflection of sadness on the face of all Justices in this institution [judiciary]. Doesn?t anybody have to feel this concern and situation? Isn?t this concern and situation for the independent judiciary established by Nepal?s Constitution??
Justice Rana observed that all three organs of the state ? executive, legislative and judiciay ? as well as political parties and civil society were also agitated over the impeachment motion.
?Can?t the three organs of state sit together to resolve the issue??
?It is said that this country is cursed by Sati. After this order, I feel all have to be careful. To liberate the country and people from the curse, I say, the court is the most sensitive organ of the state.?
Any impeachment motion against the Chief Justice and Justices can be considered constitutional, pragmatic and appropriate if they have deviated from conduct and delivery of justice, and allegations against them are objective and provable, according to the order.
Otherwise, impeachment motion cannot be considered on a par with the spirit of the Constitution?s spirit.
?Nepal?s independent judiciary bases on the very spirit of Constitution, and it continue to remain there. I am also committed to it.?
?Fiddling with the concept of independent judiciary can?t preserve the rights of any agency or people,? he said, adding that he cannot imagine of any situation sans independent judiciary.
?I have felt that it?s my duty to proceed with the beliefs and values that the path of independent judiciary should be preserved for the dignity of independent judiciary and coming generation.?
?The impeachment motion registered against Chief Justice Sushila Karki on April 30, 2017 shows that allegations made against her base on the verdict on the promotion of Nepal Police?s Inspector General, which is sub judice at the Supreme Court. But it did not base on the foundations as discussed above, it is observed at the first sight that the impeachment motion is not on a par with the spirit of Nepal?s Constitution.?

ObamaCare replacement bill approved in House
	
The American Health Care Act (AHCA) passed with a vote to spare, after weeks of cajoling within the Republican party to muster enough support.
Democrats were unanimously opposed and their House leader Nancy Pelosi called it a "cowardly choice".
President Trump predicted this "great plan" would now get Senate backing.
"Make no mistake, this is a repeal and a replace of Obamacare," he said from the Rose Garden at the White House, soon after the vote.
Its safe passage through the US lower chamber provides the new president with his first legislative victory, three months into his term.
And it marks a remarkable turnaround after the bill was left for dead in March when Republicans were unable to agree on its provisions.
But it was a close-run thing - Republicans needed 216 votes in the House and it passed with 217. No Democrats voted in favour. (BBC)

Heated arguments emerged in parliament today when Sports Minister Dayasiri Jayasekara alleged that some government doctors who were on strike in the daytime were working at private hospitals in the evening.
He displayed a receipt showing that GMOA Secretary Anurudda Padeniya had made an appointment at a leading private hospital to treat a patient at a cost of Rs.1,925 at 4.00 p.m. having organised a strike at State hospitals in the morning.
JVP leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake said the minister had no right to talk on that matter as he was not the subject minister.
Mr. Dissanayake said it was not reasonable to express opinions by other than the subject minister or the Prime Minister.
Meanwhile, House Leader Lakshman Kiriella said this was a national issue.
MP Weerawansa said the issues could not be resolved by slinging mud at doctors but the government should engage in discussions with them.
Mr. Dissanayake said private practice was the matter they were protesting against and asked what would happen if lecturers of State universities joined SAITM. (Ajith Siriwardana)

Ranjan gets channel appointment with Dr. Padeniya during strike
	
Social Empowerment and Welfare Deputy Minister Ranjan Ramanayake alleged that Government Medical Officers? Association (GMOA) President Dr. Anurudda Padeniya had attempted to engage in private practice today despite the GMOA?s 24-hour countrywide strike, but refrained from doing so as the Rr. Ramanayake had exposed his double standard on social media sites,
The Deputy Minister said he made an appointment with Dr. Padeniya on Thursday through e-channelling to consult him on Friday at a private hospital in Colombo.
The deputy minister said he paid Rs. 1,925 through his credit card for the appointment under reference no 14845842. The appointment time given was 4.05 pm today.
Later Mr. Ramanayake had posted the receipt of his appointment on his Facebook page this morning.
During a media conference held yesterday the Deputy Minister received a telephone call from the respective private hospital informing him that the doctor was not coming for channeling.
The Deputy Minister questioned the caller from the hospital about their delay in informing him about cancellation of the appointment. He said the doctor should have informed the public at least a day ahead without inconveniencing the patients as he was well aware of the trade union action he had organized.
?The GMOA President is making money through a major strike led by his own association. GMOA Secretary Dr. Naveen De Zoysa recently requested doctors not to engage in private practice during the strike days. I think he has forgotten to make the request from his own association?s president,? Deputy Minister Ramanayake said.
He said he made the appointment to highlight the double standard of the GMOA President and the GMOA?s political agenda, however Dr. Padeniya?s had cancelled his private practice on the strike day as soon as he posted his appointment on the social media.
Further he said former President Mahinda Rajapaksa had visited Dr. Padeniya soon after handing over his nominations at the last General Elections and Dr. Padeniya had appreciated Mr. Rajapaksa for contesting the election.
Mr. Ramanayake said that he was not criticizing all doctors, but Dr. Padeniya?s action had exposed the GMOA?s true intention.
However, Minister Ramanayake said Dr. Padeniya had to reimburse his money.
Responding on the matter GMOA Secretary Dr. Naveen De Zoysa said that Dr. Padeniya had informed the private hospital authorities that he would not attend patients on the day of the strike, but the hospital authorities had failed to update the channeling web page. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

Single phase electricity customers to get ToU tariff
	
The Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL) has approved a time based optional tariff for the single phase domestic consumers, which was earlier limited only for the consumers who have three phase connections and consuming 30A or above, the PUCSL said.
The government recently directed PUCSL to be the regulator for the Electric Vehicle (EV) charging industry through a Cabinet decision with a view to ensure the rights of EV users are protected.
The PUCSL said the Time of Use (ToU) tariff was identified as it would benefited the domestic users and aims to demote power usage during peak hours and promote power usage during off peak hours.
According to the introduced ToU, a consumer will be charged only Rs.13 per unit during off peak hours (2230 - 0530 hrs), Rs.25 per unit during the day (0530 - 1830 hrs) and Rs.54 per unit during peak (1830 - 2230 hrs). A monthly fixed charge of Rs.540 will also be applied to the ToU consumer.
The decision came into light sighting the observation of an increasing fleet of electric vehicles (EV) in the country and the increase of the peak demand on account of their charging load it said.
Speaking to Daily Mirror, PUCSL Assistant Director (Corporate Communication) Anushika Kamburugamuwa said the consumers are eligible to the ToU tariff after a written request made to the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) and the Lanka Electricity Company (Pvt) Ltd., (LECO).
She said the CEB studies undertaken by western utilities have found that uncontrolled natural consumer behaviour for vehicle charging invariably contributes to the evening peak.
Meanwhile, PUCSL Director General Damitha Kumarasinghe said considering the facts of energy efficiency and environmental friendliness, a big wave has been created by people in moving towards electric vehicles around the world, including Sri Lanka.
?The extension of ToU tariff to the single phase domestic users' plans to encourage energy efficiency and will benefit by the EV users in Sri Lanka, where they can charge their vehicles at a lower cost,? he said.
He further said a large volume of consumers have the option of ToU Tariffs and through the process, the peak load demand could be shifted to off-peak helping to implement the demand-based management initiatives as well. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

Strike: President says it is regrettable
	
President Maithripala Sirisena said it is highly regrettable that some people due to their political agendas have resorted to strikes when steps have been taken to solve the SAITM issue.
Speaking at a function in Anuradhapura today, he urged the medical students not to be political paws and to complete their medical education successfully for their benefit as well as for the sake of the nation. He assured that no student would be subjected to injustice.
He said that several steps have been taken to resolve issues with regard to the SAITM and they include to make clinical studies compulsory for SAITM students, SAITM students will have to face examinations approved by the Medical Council and the University Grants Commission, announce minimum qualifications for medical studies, taking over the private hospital, single ownership of the medical college to be expanded into a broad base ownership and appoint a professional council to administer it.
The President stated that those who are poor and marginalized often suffering from this kind of strikes, holding to achieve political gains. He further said that if there is any issue, there is room for any trade union to discuss those issues with the Government. ?
President Sirisena further said that it is a very pathetic situation that several trade unions, including some factions of doctors holding strikes effecting daily life of the people, in an environment where all preparation are being made to hold the UN International Vesak festival.
The President recalled the requests made by someone to hoist the black flag when the Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi arrives in Sri Lanka to attend the International Vesak festival. He also said that everyone must understand that strengthening the Indo-Lanka relationship established since introduction of Buddhism in Sri Lanka, does not mean that Sri Lanka is bowing down to India.
President Sirisena also emphasized that he will not sign any agreement with any country which is detrimental to Sri Lanka and said that he came into power not to hand over a part of the country to another country or to annul the privileges and rights of the citizens by signing unfavorable agreements with other countries.

The Left that almost was
	
?
As I pointed out last week, when we got independence we were bequeathed a government that believed in the status quo as a means of uplifting the country. That status quo subsisted on incomes generated from a stagnating primary sector. Industrialising the country was therefore never a strong point with them, as can be seen by the fact that our debt-to-GDP ratio, which stood at 18% in 1948, would shoot up to 66% by 1966. While this can be attributed to the expansionary policies following the SLFP?s victory in 1956, the truth is that the economy, even under the UNP, had been slugging at a growth rate of 3% in the fifties. ?
Uplifting the economy meant transforming it to an industrial hub. Because the private sector had largely subsisted on the extraction of raw material, this meant that the State had to play a role. Logically, that necessitated the expansion of the State. The political Right did not believe in expanding the State. For that reason, the task of industrialising the country was left largely to the Left. More pertinently, the Old Left. Which is where I get to the subject of my column. ?
?
?
When Colvin R. de Silva, N. M. Perera, and Philip Gunawardena began reforming the economy, they were vilified as trying to ?Sinofy? or ?Russify? the country. To date, this propaganda has worked: the Old Left is seen today by Right as having destroyed our potential to equal Singapore and by the nationalists as having destroyed the Sinhalese entrepreneurial spirit. I will get to the second indictment later. I am more concerned here with the first, because in it we see the self-contradictions of the post colonial bourgeoisie. ?
The LSSP and the Communist Party, with the spate of constitutional reforms initiated by the granting of the franchise in 1931, were given a historical role. This role had two sides: political and economic. I have outlined the first of these in my previous column. With the various splits (ideological and personal) that castrated these parties during the Second World War, however, they could implement any economic programme only through a monolithic party. That party was the SLFP, though it was Sirimavo Bandaranaike, not her husband, who saw in the Old Left an opportunity to revive a deteriorating industrial sector. ?
The Land Reform Act of 1972 was as much an economic necessity as it was a political response. To be sure, it was the government?s way of asserting its socialist credentials after the first JVP insurrection. On the other hand, its detractors consider it as the cause of our economic downfall. What is forgotten here is that the LRA was actually a toned down version of the land ceilings imposed in East Asia (Japan, Taiwan, and Korea). I believe the numbers prove this: while in those other countries the ceiling was as low as two or three hectares, in Sri Lanka it was no less than 10. ?
I spoke the other day with the son of a prominent leftist politician from that era who rationalised the LRA with the following observation: ?It was necessary simply because Sri Lankans were investing in housing at the expense of productive investment. During the Second World War, the British gave concessions to Sri Lankans to start industries. Instead, they invested in housing.
?
"It was necessary simply because Sri Lankans were investing in housing at the expense of productive investment. During the Second World War, the British gave concessions to Sri Lankans to start industries. Instead, they invested in housing. This is why a state industrial sector became crucial, simply because local bourgeois investors wouldn?t put their money into manufacturing."
?
This is why a state industrial sector became crucial, simply because local bourgeois investors wouldn?t put their money into manufacturing.? In other words, it was the Old Left that ironically took the role played by statist, rightwing regimes throughout East Asia with respect to industrialisation.
The failure of the Bandaranaike government to carry these reforms forward, incidentally, has less to do with the failure of the Old Left (inasmuch as it opportunistically caved into chauvinism) than with the shift in the Finance Ministry from N. M. Perera to Felix Dias Bandaranaike.
Perera was the closest we had to a J. K. Galbraith, though their political convictions were different: as H. L. D. Mahindapala noted in 1964 (before the SLFP was routed), if he was born in America, he might have earned a place in the Kennedy administration. Felix Dias was of a different mould: he brought in a blend of authoritarianism and cronyism. Colvin would later fault him for tilting the country to the rightwing excesses that rationalised J. R. Jayewardene?s Open Economy, which to an extent is true.
By the end of his tenure, Felix had appropriated for himself a near-mythical, cartoonish image, the same image that Gamini Fonseka used to lampoon him in Sagarayak Meda (a film which, more than anything else, betrayed Fonseka?s political convictions). That industrial production, which had increased by about 19% annually during the first Sirimavo Bandaranaike government, deteriorated gradually but discernibly after Perera?s departure was only to be expected: Felix simply could not replicate Perera?s reforms.
What most critics of the Old Left in Sri Lanka, whether they be nationalists or pragmatists, therefore miss out is that inasmuch as leftist economics was untenable at a time when neo- liberalism was on the rise, the Left here was combating a real, pertinent issue: the inability of our bourgeoisie to look beyond short-term profits and economic sectors which subsisted on those profits.
By the time J. R. Jayewardene won the presidency, Sirimavo Bandaranaike had wrested the land-based sector from that bourgeoisie. Earlier, for instance, it had been the norm for students from elite schools to join a plantation or an estate: after the LRA, those plantations and estates were opened to less privileged youth, which owing to inevitable class stratifications kept the elite and their children away. That is why the bourgeoisie looked for other channels of earning quick bucks after 1977. They found that channel, not in the industrial sector the previous regime had tried to get them into, but in the Pettah merchant who subsisted on (what else?) short-term profits. The shift from the landowner to the Pettah merchant reflected not only how stunted our bourgeoisie were, but also how incapable they were of aiding the economy even after a horde of tax havens, liberalised foreign exchange laws, and other schemes and incentives had been granted to them.
Moreover, given their slight tilt towards that bourgeoisie, it?s no wonder that even our nationalists, at least the more fiery among them, have an axe to grind with the Left. I leave that for a later column, but I will say this: in Sri Lanka, unlike in the West and the rest of our continent, Marxism and nationalism never really got together. For that, as with everything else I?ve highlighted in this piece, we need to look at the post colonial bourgeoisie. Again.

Why should one be diligent ?
	
?
We are fast approaching this year?s most significant Vesak celebrations. While we prepare for this event, it would be very useful to deliberate on The Buddha?s contribution to mankind for the last two thousand six hundred years which still continues to impress all people the
world over.
The term ?Buddha? is a title, given to imply ?The Enlightened One?. The more new discoveries are made in science today, the more we can marvel at the extent of The Buddha?s knowledge which He generously and with great compassion, imparted on all those who attended His discourses and those who deserved upliftment, during His life of forty five years as The Buddha. He acquired this knowledge by His own endeavour to develop His brain power through meditation, hence the term ?Enlightened One?. None of what science has found so far, is beyond The Buddha?s Teaching. They have only confirmed what The Buddha had already recognised centuries previously. That denotes the depth and comprehensiveness of the knowledge of a Buddha. We are yet to see more correlation between science and Buddhism as further revelations from science uncover facts in years to come. The Buddhist Doctrine we hear today is that of Gautama The Buddha but worry not, as all Buddhas preach the same Truths. The three cardinal Truths. They declare are :1. Anichcha? [Impermanence] 2. Dukkha [ Suffering ? (for lack of a better word)] and 3. Anaththa [No soul].
?
?
If we are not already aware, we should try to be aware - that we are living in a ?special era? as far as the evolution of this Earth is concerned. In the recent past the Earth has faced four ?ice ages? during which time human activity reduced to the minimum, if not ceased completely. Another ice age is said to be on the cards. Similarly, we have had four Buddha-eras in the ?recen tpast? of the Earth?s existence. By ?recent past? we mean that there have been four Buddhas in succession, somewhat in a cluster, at regular but ?short? intervals, starting with Buddha Kakusanda, followed by three other Buddhas, namely Konagamana, Kashyapa and Gautama.
A Buddha arises at a time when human beings are spiritually in their lowest ebb. Another Bodhisatva (someone aspiring to be a Buddha), is said to be in the final process of preparation to be the next Buddha who, when he realises his goal, will become the fifth Buddha in succession. This is a very unusual situation to have five Buddhas consecutively at short intervals; usually there is a long time gap between two Buddhas. During this ?special auspicious era? five Buddhas will have imparted their knowledge on mankind. This era is therefore called ?The Maha Bhadrakalpa? and one might say, all humankind is in a very favourable position to benefit from the Teachings of the Buddha even for the fifth time! So, for those who have ?missed out? on previous occasions to meet a Buddha, there would now ?appear? to have a new opportunity to correct any previous disadvantages. (This needs further discussion for better understanding).? ?
?
?
However, one should take serious note of one important issue here ? the ?time factor?. According to certain calculations the fifth Buddha is not due for another twenty five million years, (if all goes well and the Earth remains intact!) Ordinarily a Buddha appears once in an aeon - a ?phenomenal? period of time from a human perspective. Therefore it may be assumed that it is particularly auspicious for mankind to have the prospect of a fifth Buddha in such a short time as twenty five million years,after Gautama Buddha. So, one might come to the erroneous conclusion that all will be well for oneself once the fifth Buddha appears! Not so, my friends, for several reasons, if we understand the cycles of existence in sansara:? ?
Firstly, if by this time, we have not entered the Noble Eight-fold Path and already have joined ?the stream?, then we will not know where we would be born, to benefit from The Buddha?s Teaching.? ?
Secondly, even if one were born in the vicinity of The Buddha, there is no assurance that one would be a human being in the first instance and even then whether one possesses the necessary cognitive powers for understanding The Doctrine (The Dharma).? ?
?
?
"The term ?Buddha? is a title, given to imply ?The Enlightened One?. The more new discoveries are made in science today, the more we can marvel at the extent of The Buddha?s knowledge which He generously and with great compassion, imparted on all those who attended His discourses and those who deserved upliftment, during His life of forty five years as The Buddha. He acquired this knowledge by His own endeavour to develop His brain power through meditation, hence the term ?Enlightened One?. "
?
Thirdly, even if we had all the requisites for understanding The Dharma, one could not be certain of being even aware of the existence of such a person as The Buddha.? ?
Then, to be born to have a belief or conviction that will not permit the acceptance of The Buddha Dharma, is another impediment to consider. The Buddha dharma is based on exploration of ?Cause and Effect? ? The doctrine of PatichchaSamuppada and not on an almighty force.? ?
Thus you see the predicament one is in, if one were to wait for the next Buddha to arrive, for one?s salvation! Therefore we are advised to be wise and astute, to be ?diligent, as all conditioned things are impermanent and come to nothing?, as Gauthama Buddha declared on His parinirvana (on His passing into Nirvana) to all His followers:? ?
?HandadaniBhikkave, amanth?yamivo
vayadhammasankhara, appamadenasampadetha?.
It is up to us to take the cue and break away from all bondage in this very birth! Will we have the determination to be a stream winner and be at least a ?sotapanna? if not a fully-fledged ?saint??The time is now !

Australian boat fantasies and unlikely returns
	
?
?
?
This photograph of a boat full of 44 Sri Lankan refugees including a pregnant woman and nine children who were discovered by Indonesian Coast Guard en route to Australia, captured international attention. 12.06.2016 Courtesy: AP? 
?
?
?
?Lankawata yanna asai. Ape rata godak mathak wenawa,? (We love to go back to Sri Lanka. We miss our country very much), said by Nandini, one of Sri Lankan Tamil refugees living in Gummidpoondi camp, Chennai. Ninety nine per cent of them expressed their desire to return to their motherland. ??
While some are dreaming about the return, some refugees dream of going to Australia via boats, seeking better lives. Despite knowing it is illegal and have no chance of settling down in Australia, their attempts do not seem to be discouraged.
Very often, these desperate refugees are targetted by agents who are engaged in human trafficking. As hopes of returning to the motherland were fading, Sri Lankan refugees are hoodwinked by such agents who show them a fantasy in Australia. The refugees pay money with the purpose of leaving presumably for Australia. ?
Australia, several times toughened its immigration rules to speed up assessment and deportation of asylum-seekers. It recently toughened the process of obtaining Australian citizenship. As per the existing Australian law, those who are found to be entering the country without valid visa are sent to ?refugee dumping grounds? in Nauru and Papua New Guinea. ?
The refugee issue is now becoming a political issue between Sri Lanka and Australia. Meanwhile, a massive advertising campaign is ongoing in Sri Lanka sponsored? by the Australian government, with the purpose of raising awareness on the reality of boat journeys. The advertising campaign? carried out across all media platforms including television, radio, social media and street posters is telling people not to get caught by smugglers because they have no chance whatsoever to enter Australia.? ?
However, Sri Lankan refugees at Gummidpoondi camp said they got on boats with dreams of having a quality life and giving a quality life for their children.? ?

Aussie citizenship after two years in detention camps - Joyce
Some refugees in Gummidipoondi camp spoke of their boat journeys to Australia.? ?
?19 day boat journey is terrible. We were always anxious at what time the boat would capsize with bad weather. It was very difficult to breathe properly with the fear of death. All we had to do was pray to God and ask to take us to a safer place,? said Joice (53). ?
?We were told that we would be given Australian citizenship after spending two years in detention camps. We agreed to that. Some of our refugees had followed that procedure and are already living in Australia happily. So we keep trying,? she said. ?
The boat whice Joice and 43 others were in, had been captured by Indonesian Coast Guards and brought back to Tamil Nadu. Their boat had an engine problem. ?
There have been several such incidents in the past when Sri Lankan refugees in Tamil Nadu have been rescued after being found stranded in the sea.
?
No routes from TN, boat journey start from?Sri Lanka?- Sakuna
?Our relatives and friends have fled and are living in Australia in comfort and luxury. Moreover, they have freedom of life. We know that entering Australia has become very difficult now. But, we are citizens of nowhere. We cannot hope to go back to Sri Lanka unless we see our future secured there,? says 28-year-old Sakuna whose husband is said to be living in Australia.
Sakuna is living in Gummidipoondi camp with her 7-year-old son. They are waiting till her husband comes to the camp and takes them to Australia.? ?
She went on to say that an illegal one-way boat journey to Australia costs INR 150,000. If by agencies, the refugees have to spend INR 2.5 million to enter Australia via boats. According to Sakuna and other refugees in the Gummidipoondi camp, there are no direct routes from Tamil Nadu to Australia. All have to go to Sri Lanka. That is where the operation is carried out.
?
Facebook reports said Tamil refugees were injected with poisons - Mathews
Some false reports are circulating among these refugees regarding their fate if they return to Sri Lanka.? ?
According to another Sri Lankan refugee, Mathews, some unofficial Facebook pages and websites had reported that Sri Lankan Tamil refugees who had returned to the country from Tamil Nadu camps are injected with deadly poisons. No wehere in Sri Lankan media, such reports are recorded. Nevertheless, refugees who are willing to return, are left frightened and shattered after hearing such news. They have no way to receive correct news from official Sri Lankan media with the lack of communication facilities inside camps. ?
?We are a minority in Sri Lanka. But we want to get our old lives back, rebuild our homes and live in peace and freedom,? Mathews said. ?
?
We need requisite confidence to return?- Samuel
Forty three year old Samuel said they would voluntarily repatriate only after concrete and credible measures are taken by the Sri Lankan government. They state that they should be given adequate verifiable assurances so that they would gain the requisite confidence to return to their native land. ?
The refugees have no confidence about politicians in India and Sri Lanka. They claimed the politicians remember those in camps only when an election was nearing. ?
?They come here only during the election period. They come here, hold meetings and give promises. After winning the election, it is very difficult to even fix an appointment with them if necessary. Sri Lankan politicians are also the same,? he said. ?
Speaking about the recent political developments in the country after the establishment of the government under President Maithripala Sirisena, refugees of Gummidipoondi camp said they now have? hope and it has raised some expectations of reconciliation. Many of the refugees don?t believe they would be able to get back to their villages because there are apprehensions about the presence of the Sri Lankan Army in their home towns. They feel confined in closed camps for decades, the intention of going back to the motherland does not seem to be happening in the near future.
?
Our children have no jobs in India?- Nandini
Most refugees have refused to go back to Sri Lanka saying the government there has not come up with a clear plan for their resettlement and reintegration. They have lost everything in the war and cannot see how to restart their lives if they go back to their motherland without the support of the government. ?
Nandini said that she misses her siblings who are living in Sri Lanka. Nandini is waiting till her daughter Sheena finishes her Msc.?
?Anyway, our children have no jobs in India despite having adequate qualifications. My family is planning to return to Sri Lanka after my daughter finishes her studies. We don?t feel India is our home,? she said. ?
They don?t have a clear picture of the circumstances in Sri Lanka in order to make a final decision to move back home. ?
?We have no idea what is happening in Sri Lanka. Some of our people in camps said Tamil refugees who went back to Sri Lanka were being prosecuted over allegations of having connections with LTTE. I have no idea if I can enjoy a normal life there. I have a lot of queries to be clarified before returning,? said Nandini.

Concerns over Cabinet paper ordering release of detained elephants
	
The government?s decision to handover the elephants involved in court cases back to their owners for a bond of Rs.10 million with a valid license was not merely a violation of the law, but also an encouragement to all those who illegally possess elephants, Environmentalist Jagath Gunawardena said recently.
?Sustainable Development and Wildlife Minister Gamini Jayawickrema has submitted a Cabinet paper ordering the release of 35 detained elephants with the intention of using them for religious events. However, if there were a shortage of tamed elephants for this purpose, then the relevant authorities could hire such elephants from the tourism industry. There is no need to release detained elephants to fill the void by violating several laws including the Flora and Fauna Act,? Mr. Gunawardena told a news conference recently.
Attached with the Cabinet paper is a report, devised by a special committee headed by Minister Sarath Amunugama, which recommends the confiscation of five elephants from the owners who did not hold a valid license.
?There are six cases in courts in connection with the registration of elephants. In many cases, the poor animals die while in captivity. It is however recommended that legal action be taken against those who aid and abet to produce forged documents to acquire the elephants. Most of the accused are wildlife officers,? Mr. Gunawardena said. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

DFCC Bank March quarter profit up on better margins
	
The DFCC Bank PLC group reported a net profit of Rs.1.36 billion or Rs.5.13 a share for its January ? March quarter, gaining 42.5 percent from the corresponding quarter last year as the bank appears to have managed to expand its margins under the rising interest rate scenario but the loans have barely grown, the interim results released by the?
bank showed.?
The provisions against possible bad loans also fell significantly giving a boost to the bottom line.?
The net interest income rose by 44.4 percent to Rs.2.59 billion and the fee and commission incomes also grew by 12.4 percent to Rs.342.9 million from a year ago. The net interest margin was stretched to 3.6 percent from 3.3 percent in December 2016. The bank appears to have repriced its existing loan portfolio in line with the rising interest rates and the bank may have also received higher yield from its gilt-edged investments.
The bank has Rs.46.3 billion in available-for-sale assets, which are in equities and government securities. ?
The loans and receivables grew by only Rs.1.4 billion or 0.73 percent during the quarter. ?
DFCC Bank had predominantly been a project lender but now has a higher focus on consumer lending. DFCC Bank in 2015 absorbed its commercial banking subsidiary, DFCC Vardhana Bank PLC after the proposed merger between DFCC Bank PLC and NDB Bank PLC was abandoned. ?
Meanwhile, the bank?s specific provisions fell to Rs.211.4 million during the quarter under review from Rs.476.8 million reported for the corresponding period last year. However, the gross non-performing loan ratio rose to 3.34 percent from 2.97 percent three months ago. ?
The bank?s deposits base grew by Rs.3.1 billion due to the foreign currency deposit/s but the rupee deposits fell. ??
The low-cost deposits measured by the current and savings account (CASA) ratio, slipped to 18 percent from 20 percent in 2016.?
The bank?s trading book made a gain of Rs.31 million while the marked-to-market losses of its available-for-sale investments declined to Rs.1.69 billion from Rs.2.77 billion a year ago due to positive gains from equity and gilt investments, the bank said in an earnings release.?
Both Tier I and Tier II capital adequacy ratios stood at 12.98 percent and 16.39 percent levels, respectively, significantly above the regulatory minimums of 5.0 percent and?
10.0 percent.?
As of March 31, 2017, the government collectively held a 33.54 percent stake in DFCC Bank via Bank of Ceylon, Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation and the Employees? Provident Fund.?
HNB held a 12.22 percent stake in DFCC Bank being the second?

A person coming under Jamma Shani Erashtaka during his/her childhood would suffer from all diseases that children would normally fall victim to. ?A native would suffer from a fracture, a ligature tear or a severe sprain or an injury in the left leg with the advent of Saturn to the 12th House or the sign previous to the one where the Moon was placed at birth. (We have already explained in the previous article that Saturn?s advent to this sign marks the beginning of his 7 ? year ? Erashtaka period and Saturn?s 2 ? year-transit in the sign where the Moon is posited at birth is the mid-phase of the three-phase malefic period.) ?
If it is an injury that the native suffers, it would remain unhealed for several months even if it is a minor one.?
When a child comes under Shani Erashtaka during the school-going age, he/she would fall victim to a disease or an injury which would affect his/her mobility or he/she would run away from home leading to a disruption of his/her schooling. The child would become mentally unsound and would look on everyone as his/her enemies. ?Once he/she leaves home, he/she would become a vagabond. He/she would visit friends and relatives at odd hours and would become a nuisance to them. ?He/she would wander about half-starved and garbed in a dirty rags. ?Even if he/she is brought back home, he/she would not resume schooling.?
?
Effects of Erashtaka at?young age
When a person at a young age comes under the Erashtaka, if employed he (?she? is also meant wherever the pronoun ?he? is used) would mess up his job. He would be so clumsy in his work; his superiors would decide to terminate his services. Friends and relatives would shun him. ??
He would act as one who has lost his mindfulness. He would suffer from a serious injury or a fracture on the left leg. ?He would go from place to place in search of a job, but he would not get one. ?Once the Erashtaka period is over, the native would secure a job and would settle down to a quiet normal life. ?He might become even rich and make a great success of his life.?
?
How it affects occupation and life after marriage
When a person comes under the Erashtaka after marriage, his wife would fall sick and may not live long, unless there is a powerful planetary combination in her horoscope assuring her of longevity. A native would lose his job and he would be shunned by parents and relatives.?
Even his children would suffer in various ways. ?
They would, for example, become subject to constant illness and their schooling would get disrupted. People who earlier respected him, would look the other way when they see him now. ?If he is a farmer, insects, rodents and various pests would ruin his crops. ?
Flies and birds would destroy his fruits and vegetables. ?If the native happens to be a trader, only customers buying on credit would visit his store or shop. ?If the native is a physician only terminally ill patients would consult him. If the native is a Minister in the State, he would lose his portfolio.

India to supply second vessel to SL Navy
	
India?s Goa Shipyard is expected to transfer an offshore patrol vessel (OPV) to Sri Lanka next month.
India has delivered the second fast patrol vessel (FPV), christened MCGS Valiant, to the Mauritius Police Force?s National Coast Guard couple of days ago and has plans to deliver an offshore to Sri Lanka, Sputnik news reported today.
Mauritius was given the second Fast Patrol Vessel and Sri Lanka is to get an advanced offshore patrol vessel (OPV). The ships to both the countries have been delivered months before schedule.
Goa Shipyard Limited (GSL) has also begun work on the second OPV destined for the Sri Lankan Navy on Tuesday which is scheduled to deliver next year.
"India has the capability to build such vessels and give them to friendly countries. We are cooperating with all our neighboring countries, and wherever we have weapons, we can cooperate and be a partner in their security setup." A K Gupta, Secretary, Defense Production said after the launch of the advanced OPV for Sri Lanka.
"From that perspective, Sri Lanka is a major partner in our bilateral relationship and this OPV is a major milestone in our bilateral relationship," Gupta added.
The Indian government had sanctioned two OPVs for Sri Lanka in 2010 and the contract for the same was signed in April 2013.
The 105.7-meter-long and 13.6-meter-wide vessels have a full-load displacement capacity of 2350 ton, with an overall beam of 13.6 meters, and a hull draught of 3.6 meters.
The OPV can reach a top speed of 24 knots and accommodate a crew of 118, including 18 officers, and a helicopter on its flight deck. (defenseworld.net)
