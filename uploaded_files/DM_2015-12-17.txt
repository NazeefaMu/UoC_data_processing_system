Floating armoury: Court insists vessel be handed over to shipping co.
	
The Galle Deputy Habour Master was ordered by court today to carry out immediately the earlier court order to release the ship that contained the floating armoury to the shipping company or else action would be taken against him for contempt of court.
Galle Chief Magistrate Nilupuli Lankatilleka severely warned the Deputy Harbour Master for his failure to enforce the court order and held that the approval of the Navy or the CID was not required to enforce a court order.
Ceylon Shipping Lines that owned the ship had informed court on several occasions that the ship was in an unserviceable condition and it was liable to develop oil leaks or any other defect causing extensive environmental damage. The court had permitted them to replace the ship and to transfer the armoury and informed the court order to the Habour Master and the Southern Commander of the Navy.
However, when the officials failed to enforce the court order, the Magistrate had made an order for the second time. When the case was taken up on a motion filed by the shipping line that the ship was yet to be released, the Deputy Harbour Master was noticed to appear in court today. The shipping company informed court that the weapons had already been handed over to the Navy. (D.G. Sugathapala)

LB Finance gets A-(lka) with stable outlook from Fitch
	
Fitch Ratings has assigned LB Finance PLC a national long-term rating at A-(lka) with a stable outlook. According to Fitch the rating reflects its established franchise among licensed finance companies, and sustained sound profitability. 
The rating upholds significant efforts and processes put into improve the GRC-(Governance, Risk & Compliance) aspects across the organization. Company has made significant strides in the recent past to improve its risk management capabilities and strengthen independent oversight role of risk management across credit, market, liquidity and operational risk areas LB Finance Executive Director Niroshan Udage said.
The rating reflects Fitchs expectation that LBs profitability remains sufficient to allow for growth, while maintaining capital ratios at the current level. 
Companys cost to income ratio remained the lowest among the peers at 36 percent at end 1H16 on the back of greater scales. The regulatory Tier 1 ratio stood at 16 percent at end FY15.
The rating agency observes that the companys business focus remains on vehicle financing (75 percent of the loan book at end 1H16) with motor cars and three wheelers accounting for 26 percent and 24 percent of the total at end 1H16.
About 60 percent of its motor car and three wheeler loans comprise unregistered vehicles, which is a positive as they are newly imported and are of a better credit quality.
An upgrade of the companys rating, Fitch asserts, is contingent upon achieving stronger capitalization levels along with a moderation of its risk appetite. A more comfortable liquidity position would also support the rating.

NPC not used a cent for development: Douglas
	
The Northern Provincial Council (NPC) had become a meaningless institution as it had not used a single cent out of the funds allocated for it by the Central Government, Opposition MP Douglas Devananda told Parliament today.
Mr. Devananda who is an MP representing the Northern District of Jaffna said the funds allocated for the provincial council even in 2013 and 2014 had not been utilized.
He questioned as to whether the Central government would take any steps to reclaim the unutilized funds from the provincial council.
Mr. Devananda recalled that even the ENDLF and EPRLF alliance which formed the North East Provincial council had failed to fulfil political aspirations of the people in the area.
Further, he said the NPC is special compared to other provincial councils as it has to serve a group of people who had been battered by the war.
Leader of the House Lakshman Kiriella who responded, said Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe would make a statement on the matter in Parliament soon. (Yohan Perera)

Yes, my daughter-in-law is studying at SAITM: Rajitha
	
Cabinet Spokesman and Minister Rajitha Senaratne today admitted that his daughter-in-law was studying at SAITM and added that not only her but that many of his relatives were studying there.
He said the Health Ministry permitted to facilitate clinical training for students at the Malabe private Medical College following a court order on a payment of Rs. 50,000 per student and there was no personal or political consideration involved in that decision.
The Inter-University Students' Federation (IUSF) yesterday said that Minister Senaratne's daughter-in-law (MP Chathura Senaratne's wife), was following a course at the SAITM and that that was why Dr. Senaratne was striving to protect SAITM.
Minister Senaratne said if the Health Ministry did not permit SAITM (South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine) students to have their clinical training at a government hospital, the Health Secretary would be held responsible for contempt of court as the Health Ministry had undertaken earlier to permit SAITM students to provide facilities for clinical training. Subsequently, the Health Ministry permitted then to have clinical training at the Avissawella and Kaduwela hospitals.
SAITM students cannot have clinical training at the Malabe Neville Fernando Teaching Hospital due to lack of sufficient patients or beds there.
Meanwhile, Minister Senaratne questioned as to why the Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) did not oppose the medical college that was set up at the Kotalawala Defence University (KDU).
Was it because former defence secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa gave the GMOA a telephone call asking to explain GMOAs position on the issue he asked. (Sandun A Jayasekera)
