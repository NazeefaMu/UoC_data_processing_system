Bribery Com. DG resigned to avoid action on bond scam culprits: JHU
	
Yesterdays resignation of Bribery Commission (BC) Director General Dilrukshi Wickramasinghe is a move to avoid possible action against the culprits of the Central Bank (CB) bond scam, the Jathika Hela Urumaya (JHU) said today.
The JHU, which has repeatedly criticized the delay when taking action against offenders by the BC, CID and the FCID, said she had proved herself to be inefficient and accused her of carrying out her duties based on political agendas.
She is fond of some of the top government leaders. The COPE report on the CB bond scam is to be published shortly will reveal who the real culprits are. She knows she will have to face difficult times when the case is referred to the Bribery Commission. This is why she resigned in the wake of the Presidents outburst, JHU National Organiser Nishantha Sri Warnasinghe told Daily Mirror.
However, he said the JHU was not aware of the reasons for her resignation but said the Presidents speech was not a cause for her to resign. After all, she shouldnt forget that the President is not a ceremonial President. There is nothing wrong with informing the Leader of the country about the progress of the cases and investigations being carried out, he said.
When the Commission was blamed for being inefficient, Mr. Warnasinghe said the Director complained of inadequate human resources, facilities and salaries. Parliament recently approved a salary increment for her and had attended to the other needs as well, he said.
He said the action taken by the BC with regard to the Avant Garde controvesy was also questionable. Therefore, an efficient and an impartial officer should be appointed to the post of DG, Mr. Warnasinghe said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

MR says surprised over President's FCID remark
	
Former President and Kurunegala district MP Mahinda Rajapaksa said he was surprised to note that President Maithripala Sirisena was unaware of the action of the Financial Crimes Investigation Division (FCID).
Addressing a religious ceremony at a temple in Lunugamvehera on Sunday, he said the Executive President should be strong enough to run the country properly. But during the past two years the government focused only on taking revenge, he said.
He said the government took revenge not only from him and his family members but also from Buddhist monks.
They took Buddhist monks to the FCID. Questioning them on how did they build their temples and who funded them. Then they searched for the funded list and questioned on them how much they funded for the constructions. More than 20,000 people had been summoned to the FCID for questioning. There are 48 Buddhist monks were who sentenced to prison, Mr. Rajapaksa said.
He alleged these moves could be a part of a conspiracy carrying out against a religion. Some people in the government are not ready to accept what the white men accepted. They accepted that Buddhism should be given prominence from the constitution, he said.
He said the judiciary or the responsible officials should think thoroughly before taking action. (Chaturanga Pradeep)
