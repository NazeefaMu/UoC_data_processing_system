Indian fishermen causing damage to marine ecology: PM
	
As many as 1000 Indian trawlers are engaged in illegal fishing in Sri Lanka's territorial waters off the North and the East for the last one month, causing an extensive damage to marine ecology, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said in Parliament yesterday.
The Prime Minister said action would be taken to ban bottom trawling here, and Tamil National Alliance (TNA) MP M.A. Sumanthiran had worked out legislation as a Private Member's Bill providing for it.
He said the subject Minister would take steps to gazette it shortly. The Prime Minister made these remarks in response to a question directed at him by Chief Opposition Whip Anura Kumara Dissanayake. As pointed by Mr. Dissanayake, the Prime Minister said illegal fishing had impacted livelihood of Sri Lankan fishermen of the North.
Outlining measures taken at diplomatic level for the resolution of the fisheries issue between the two countries, he said the government would speak to the authorities of Tamil Nadu.
"Such engagements remained stalled because of elections in Tamil Nadu. We can resume it now," he said.
Asked whether it was decide to specify special fishing zones in Sri Lankan waters for Indian fishermen on allotted days, he said there were various proposals from both sides to find a solution, but none had been agreed upon yet.
"We have to finish off this problem this year. We cannot drag on it any further," he said.
He said a solution, acceptable to northern fishermen, only would be worked out.
Mr. Dissanayake said there should not be any compromise for sharing the fisheries resources of Sri Lanka in any case.
Also, he said India had a similar issue with Pakistan, but action was taken to prevent Indian fishermen encroaching Pakistani waters.
"They designated a boundary line and a GPS system was installed to monitor Indian vessels crossing it,," he said.

?President is the head of the government and therefore has the power to appoint the cabinet. He announced the stand of the government with regard to foreign judges. However, the Minister expressed a different opinion and therefore it is a violation of collective responsibility of the Cabinet," he said.
MP Dallas Alhaperuma who spoke about the shadow cabinet said its purpose of was to monitor the work of the minister. ?Shadow cabinet is a common concept in politics but the shadow cabinet of ours is different as we will be monitoring the work of the ministers" he said.

More air time to criticize govt.: President
	
President Maithripala Sirisena said yesterday private television channels had allocated more air time to criticize the government? instead of showcasing? the development activities carried out by the government.
?It is reported that some private television channels allocate 80% of their air time to criticize the government. They only give less than 20% of the time for acknowledging people about the development activities of the country and the policies of the government?, the President said.
He said this during an inspection visit to the Telecommunications Regulatory Commission of Sri Lanka (TRC) yesterday to look into the activities of the TRC as it comes under the purview of the President.
?There is no problem of criticizing the government. But the media institutions have a responsibility to fulfill for the country by conveying fair and balanced information to the people?, he pointed out.
?It is not a task to alleviate the media, but to give the right to the people for a meaningful media usage?, the President added.

Nalin Bandara complains to FCID over Rs. 4.2 billion fraud
	
UNP MP Nalin Bandara today lodged a complaint with the Financial Crimes Investigation Division (FCID) alleging that more than Rs. 4.2 billion had been defrauded by the authorities of the previous regime by purchasing two ships at a cost of USD 35 million in 2014 though it actually cost only Rs. USD 20 million in the market.
MP Bandara said one ship named Ceylon Breeze (IMO 9734563) had already been brought to the country while the Deputy Minister and Chairman of the Shipping Cooperation had left to bring the other ship to Sri Lanka.
He said even though these two ships were claimed to be brand new, they seemed to be old ships repaired to look new as their IMO numbers, which denotes the date of its year of manufacturing, starts with 97.
Mr. Bandara said former President Mahinda Rajapaksa was the cabinet minister of Ports, Rohitha Abeygunawardane was the project minister of ports while Jayanath Colombage acted as the Chairman of the Ports Authority when the purchasing took place.
He requested the FCID to conduct an investigation into the incident and reveal the culprits behind the corruption. (Ajith Siriwardana)

New constitution may divide country: MR
	
The 'Yahapalana Government' intends to divide the country by passing a new Constitution, former President Mahinda Rajapaksa charged yesterday.
?We have come to know that the government is trying to pass a new constitution. The constitution may include some hidden terms and clauses that will only divide the country and which are detrimental to Sri Lankan Buddhists and Buddhism. The People and especially the Buddhist clergy must be alert to this situation,? he said.
?It is very important for the people to know that 15 Acts are to be presented to Parliament soon. Most of them were promised in the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) in Geneva. Among these proposals is the establishment of hybrid courts to address allegations of war crimes and crimes against humanity during the war,? Rajapaksa alleged.

PM trying to make way for foreign judges: GL
	
In the wake of Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe calling for the Speaker to overrule a Supreme Court ruling, former UPFA MP G.L. Peiris said it looked like an attempt to make way for the appointment of foreign judges to try war crimes against the armed forces.
In the Singarasa case the SC held that the judicial power of the Republic could only be exercised by courts and tribunals set up under the Constitution of Sri Lanka.
Referring to this direction, Mr. Peiris said this power could not be alienated to others.
"That is contrary to both the law and the spirit of the Constitution. It is preposterous to use Parliament and the powers of the Speaker to overturn a judgment. That is a binding judicial ruling," he said. "This is sinister in view of the current controversy with regard to the appointment of foreign judges to try war crimes against armed forces."
Referring to the Paragraph nine of the report on Sri Lanka by the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Mr. Peiris said it advocated the involvement of international judicial personnel.
"This looks like entirely import attempt to pave the way to do something which is contrary to the Constitution of Sri Lanka, which is prohibited by the Supreme Court," he said. (Kelum Bandara)

Removal of natural reef after submission of EFR
	
An Environmental Feasibility Report (EFR) is being drafted by the Minister of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development requesting the removal of the natural reef which claims to hinder the Dehiwela coastal line and to build a breakwater. Minister of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Mahinda Amaraweera has requested for this report and after inspection, the Minister has suggested removing the reef and building a breakwater.
However, Mr. Amaraweera has also pointed out the risks that the people will face once the reef is removed. Therefore soil erosion will take place faster and many houses will be washed away. Once the report is submitted the Ministry will be allocating funds to remove the reef and to build a breakwater and allow the fishermen to engage in their activities.
Eminent environmental expert and systems ecologist Dr. Ranil Senanayake said that if this breakwater is removed Colombo will be losing its last environmental protection against the rising of the sea level. ?The politicians don?t understand the gravity of its impact after it?s removed. For all these years, how did these boats leave to the sea? Why do they suggest that it should be removed all of a sudden? This is completely ridiculous and if future there will be many adverse impacts on climate change if such an action is being taken.?
Aruna Roshantha of the All Ceylon Fisheries Union said that removing the natural breakwater is not a wise thing to be done. ?Fishermen too have their own experiences. If they claim it to be a barrier for them, then the authorities should ensure that they develop favourable conditions for the fishermen to do their fishing. Some of them do fishing during the night and during the days of rough tides, there could be an added risk.
According to the fishermen this reef has caused many deaths while on their voyages and has imposed a huge risk on their lives. So far 6 fishermen have lost their lives as a result of their boats hitting the reef and eventually capsizing. However, the Daily Mirror also learned that over the years, the fishermen have been taking their boats out to the sea through a place named ?kadamaththa?, a U-shaped inversion that has been designed for this purpose. Yet, during the night fishermen usually forget where they have to leave from and at times they are under the influence of alcohol.
A few days back a protest was held by a group of fishermen blocking the railway lines in Dehiwela and requesting the authorities to remove the reef that is obstructing their day-to-day activities. The issue was taken in to consideration by the Minister two months ago and after his visit to the area he has decided to remove the reef and build a breakwater to reduce the rising sea level.
A meeting will be held today at the Ministry to discuss about the removal of the reef with the presence of the Minister and the fishing community. (Kamanthi Wickramasinghe)

However, he said appointing monitoring MPs to each ministry was more appropriate. ?I think former President Mahinda Rajapaksa had also expressed similar sentiments regarding the shadow cabinet,? he said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)
