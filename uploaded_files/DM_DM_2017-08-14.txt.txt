AG to act on 80 major corruption cases soon  PM
	
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe yesterday vowed that the Attorney General would initiate action against more than 80 high profiled persons, including politicians, who have been charged with corruption.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe came out with this information when a group of people approached him outside the Dalada Maligawa, when he was coming out after attending religious ceremonies at the historic temple.
Religious programmes were held at the Dalada Maligawa to mark the 40th anniversary of him becoming an MP.
The people who approached him questioned as when action would be taken against those who had been charged with corruption.
More than 80 investigations on corruption have been completed and had been handed over to the Attorney General and he will take appropriate action in due course," the Premier told the people.
Earlier, he pledged that development work in the hill capital including the constitution of Central Highway would be expedited.
He said the project would be partly funded by the Sri Lankan Government, Japan and China.
Further, he told the Most Venerable Maha Nayake Theras of the Asgiriya and Malwatthu Chapters that the Government would undertake the renovation of Golden Canopy of Dalada Maligawa.
He pledged to renovate the Golden Canopy, which was constructed during the era of late President Ranasinghe Premadasa.
The Most Venerable Anu Nayake Thera, who held an Anusasana said the Buddhist clergy trusted that the Government would not do any harm to Buddhism. (Yohan Perera and J A L Jayasinghe)

BBC puts him in a class of his own
	
Book review - Elmo Fernando, Kolamba Sita
Vijith Kumar Senaratne has written several books about notable media personalities and figures from the entertainment industry. Elmo Fernando, Kolamba Sita (Elmo Fernando, from Colombo) is a new book by him which tries to capture the key moments in the life of one of the best known, and controversial, radio announcers of Sri Lanka. 
Elmo Fernando became controversial because of his unbiased reporting for the BBCs Sinhala service Sandeshaya during the difficult civil war years. His reported impartially in the BBC tradition at a time when media reporting about the war  newspapers, radio and TV  were for the most part biased, sometimes even hysterical, and his factual reporting did not go down well with hard-line Sinhala listeners, or those politically nave. 
The book is not a detailed biography. It is rather an anecdotal account within a biographical framework which manages to capture the key events in Elmo Fernandos life, from his birth in Negombo to schooling and upbringing in Chilaw, where a teacher spotted his talent for public announcing and encouraged him to work in that direction, a route that would make him a household name not only in Sri Lanka but also take him to BBC headquarters in London. 
"The book is anecdotal, but not all of them are touching or funny. The one about his taxi ride to a Tony Blair meeting in London is touching. But some are bleak, including attempts at character assassination and other nasty (and futile) attempts to destroy his career. But what finally emerges is a portrait of an admirable man"


His first job was as a co-operative billing clerk. But Elmo Fernando owed his big break to a chance factor  speaker Shirley Corea, a relation of the SLBCs Vernon Corea, was a neighbour. Elmo told Shirley Corea about his dream of becoming a radio announcer, and the result was a meeting with Vernon Corea, who put him under the tutelage of the legendary Karunaratne Abeysekara. 
He became a relief announcer at the SLBC (then CBC) in 1966. Life was tough at the beginning. Even after some time, his monthly earnings came to Rs. 88 whereas his boarding fees cost him Rs. 90. By 1970, Elmo Fernando was an experienced radio announcer working on contract basis. But political intrigue and back biting of the kind which plagues Sri Lankas government institutions soon became a bigger concern than the financial kind. Elmo Fernando underwent this nasty experience for the first time during the April 1971 JVP insurrection, when he was summarily ordered to leave the radio station by its Chairman Susil Munasinghe. Gossip had taken its effect. Elmos father-in-law, a former policeman, advised him not to leave home until things calmed down, advice which probably saved him from arrest or worse.

Elmo was recalled back to work on April 30, 1971 and the good news was delivered in person by the commercial services programme manager. K. S. Wickremaratne. The conditions under which state radio employees worked is illustrated by this story  the holder of such an important post travelled from his office to Elmos home in Malabe on a bicycle. 
On July 1, 1971, Elmo became a permanent employee of the CBC. Its political pressure cooker, fed by the countrys own volatile politics, eventually affected Elmo, to the point that he became a spokesman for the opposition UNP during its political rallies. The state radio became lawless during election night, when it became clear that the SLFP-coalition government was facing a massive defeat. Elmo Fernando refused to rub salt on the wounds by airing partisan songs. 

"The book is not a detailed biography. It is rather an anecdotal account within a biographical framework which manages to capture the key events in Elmo Fernandos life, from his birth in Negombo to schooling and upbringing in Chilaw, where a teacher spotted his talent for public announcing and encouraged him to work in that direction"
The next stage in his broadcasting career came when he joined the Sinhala service of Veritas in the Philippines, thus widening his horizons. There, he met Dr. Graham Mitten of the BBC, a meeting which proved to be momentous. His long and successful tenure working for Sandeshaya earned him both fame and notoriety, depending on which side of the political spectrum his listeners were.
Sometimes, that reputation required him to go beyond his duties as a broadcaster; for example, when he was asked to join family members of disappeared servicemen on an emotional journey to Kilinochchi to meet Thamil Chelvam. This visit resulted in a backlash from the BBC, launched by employees of its Tamil service, proof that the SLBC has no monopoly on nasty politics. 
The book is anecdotal, but not all of them are touching or funny. The one about his taxi ride to a Tony Blair meeting in London is touching. But some are bleak, including attempts at character assassination and other nasty (and futile) attempts to destroy his career. But what finally emerges is a portrait of an admirable man  admirable because, while some of his peers and contemporaries may have been better, more popular announcers, they worked on relatively safe ground. The challenge Elmo Fernando faced working for the BBC puts him in a class of his own, and shows that he was made of a very hard metal indeed.

BEIJING- China wont come to North Koreas aid if it launches missiles threatening U.S. soil and there is retaliation, a state-owned newspaper warned Friday  but it would intervene if Washington strikes first. 
The Global Times newspaper is not an official mouthpiece of the Communist Party, but in this case its editorial probably does reflect government policy, experts said. 
The stern Chinese warning came as government leaders and politicians around the world urged calm after a series of threats and counterthreats by the U.S. and North Korean governments. The brinkmanship has spread jitters and weighed on global financial markets, which were down Friday for a fourth consecutive day. 
German Chancellor Angela Merkel on Friday called the escalating rhetoric the wrong answer. She pledged her countrys support for any nonmilitary solutions, telling reporters in Berlin, I dont see a military solution to this conflict. 
Russias foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, said there had been an overwhelming amount of belligerent rhetoric from Washington and Pyongyang. The side that is stronger and cleverer will take the first step to defuse tensions, he said.

Muhunthan Canagey, the CEO and Managing Director of the Information and Communication Technology Agency (ICTA) of Sri Lanka has announced his resignation from the agency.
He said he had been asked to resign by President Maithripala Sirisena and the message was communicated to him by Minister Harin Fernando.
His statement is as follows:
As you all know I am a person who has built my career bypure hard work and maintained the highest levels of professionalism and integrity.
I will never be part of aiding and abetting any fraud or corruption or delay in any implementation of Digitization in Sri Lanka. I have been raised from a child to speak my mind, boldly, fearlessly and honestly which are the very basic principles I live by and the rights that should prevail to me and any other human being. I am not willing to let go of that just because I need to protect my job at ICTA.
Under this circumstance it is regrettable that I am tendering my resignation and start commencing my handing over of my duties, he said.

Car plows into street filled with people opposed to the white nationalists
	

By Joe Heim, Ellie Silverman, T. Rees Shapiro, Emma Brown 
CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va. -
Chaos and violence turned to tragedy Saturday as hundreds of white nationalists, neo-Nazis and Ku Klux Klan members - planning to stage what they described as their largest rally in decades to take America back - clashed with counter-protesters in the streets and a car plowed into crowds, leaving one person dead and 19 others injured. 
Hours later, two state police officers died when their helicopter crashed at the outskirts of town. 
Gov. Terry McAuliffe (D), who had declared a state of emergency in the morning, said at an evening news conference that he had a message for all the white supremacists and the Nazis who came into Charlottesville today: Go home. You are not wanted in this great commonwealth. 
State and local officials declined to take reporters questions and abruptly left after making statements. 
Video recorded at the scene of the car crash shows a 2010 gray Dodge Challenger accelerating into crowds on a pedestrian mall, sending bodies flying - and then reversing at high speed, hitting yet more people. Witnesses said the street was filled with people opposed to the white nationalists who had come to town bearing Confederate flags and anti- Semitic epithets. 
A 32-year-old woman was killed, according to police, who said they were investigating the crash as a criminal homicide. 
The driver of the Challenger, James Alex Fields Jr., 20, of Ohio, was arrested and charged with one count of second-degree murder, three counts of malicious wounding, and one count of hit-and-run attempted failure to stop with injury, police said. He is being held without bail and is scheduled to be arraigned Monday, Albemarle-Charlottesville Regional Jail Superintendent Martin Kumer said.

From this week (15th) onwards Ceylinco VIP On The Spot policy holders could enjoy the benefit of Rs.1 million cover on medical, which is introduced as a new innovation to the existing motor insurance policy.
This scheme we are going to introduce along with the motor policy is to cover you from all serious illnesses, if you are a policy holder. Starting from cancer then going into heart diseases and more, Ceylinco General Insurance CEO Ajith Gunawardena said.
This new cover will be valid for new policies, while existing policy holders will be entitled to this new benefit from the date of their next renewal.
Out of the 21 illnesses, kidney failure, major organ transplants, chronic lung, liver diseases, deafness, paralysis are some of the illnesses that would reimburse medical costs incurred in the treatment.
As Sri Lanka does not have a national insurance scheme unlike other countries, Gunawardena said that through this introduction locals could enjoy that benefit be it in a private hospital or a government hospital.
Considering ever increasing medical costs, this benefit will undoubtedly ease the financial burden on our customers to a great extent. Policy holders of motor insurance will have a cover up to Rs.100,000 of their hospital bills.
So thats a great thing because our society doesnt have a national insurance scheme, he said. However, he noted that pre- existing illnesses will not be covered under this product.
With Ceylinco VIP enjoying the major share of the vehicle insurance market, most Sri Lankan users will be entitled to this benefit, he added.
He also noted with Ceylinco On The Spots success in Sri Lanka as well as in their overseas markets, they are trying to bring the time down to 25 minutes when reaching an accident site in any part of the country, which takes 27 minutes at present. Managing Director Patrick Alwis said that comprehensive motorcycle and three-wheeler policy holders will be entitled to a cover of Rs. 100,000 and third party customers too will benefit with a cover of Rs.100,000 under this product.
In the case of individual customers, the insured will be entitled to this benefit, while corporate customers or fleet owners must name an individual as beneficiary. For individual customers with more than one vehicle, the spouse or immediate family members could be named as beneficiaries, it was noted.
Further, it was shared that seeing a 22 percent growth in the first six months of this year, compared to the same period last year, their expectation is to grow up to 30 percent by end of this year.
Ceylinco VIP, which was introduced in 2003, is one of the most comprehensive vehicle insurance policies available in Sri Lanka, offering several additional benefits such as on the spot settlement of claims and a similar replacement vehicle for repairs that exceed four days, a Rs. 4 million emergency hospitalization insurance cover and personal accident cover up to Rs. 200,000 for each passenger.
It was noted that currently they have their products in seven countries including Bahrain, Qatar, Mauritius, Maldives, etc.

CRISPR fixes disease gene in human embryos
	

Scientists have used gene-editing tool CRISPR-Cas9 to fix a DNA mutation responsible for a common inherited disease -- successfully replacing a gene in defective embryos that can cause
heart failure.
The researchers targeted a mutation in a gene called MYBPC3. Such mutations cause the heart muscle to thicken -- a condition known as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy that is the leading cause of sudden death in young athletes. The mutation is dominant, meaning if one parent has a mutated copy, there is a 50 percent chance of passing the disease to children.
The study, published in the journal Nature, used sperm from a man with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and eggs from 12 healthy women, from which the researchers created fertilised eggs. By injecting CRISPR-Cas9, which works as genetic scissors, they were able to snip out the mutated DNA sequence of the male MYBPC3 gene.
The male gene then copied the perfect sequence from the female gene. Out of 58 embryos, 42 emerged mutation-free. The method was not perfect, however, as the remaining 16 embryos had unwanted additions or deletions of DNA.
Potentially, CRISPR gene editing could apply to any of more than 10,000 conditions caused by inherited mutations -- including breast and ovarian cancer linked to BRCA mutations, as well as diseases like Huntingtons, Tay-Sachs, beta thalassemia, and even sickle cell anaemia, cystic fibrosis or some cases of early-onset Alzheimers. -August 3, 2017

HINDUSTAN TIMES, 13th AUGUST, 2017-An Egyptian prosecutor has ordered the detention of the train drivers and their assistants involved in the fatal collision in Alexandria on Friday, state news agency MENA said.
At least 41 people were killed and 133 injured, the health ministry said, when two trains collided in the coastal city on Friday, the latest in a string of crashes have inflamed public anger over an antiquated transport network.
Egyptians have long complained that successive governments failed to enforce basic safeguards for railways.
A witness said the trains rose into the air forming a pyramid as they slammed into each other just outside a suburban station in the Mediterranean port city.
The prosecutor ordered two train drivers and two assistants be held for 15 days and released several other railway employees, MENA said. Blood and urine samples were taken from one driver to check for drug use.
President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi has ordered an inquiry into the crash.

Endowed with fighting spirit
	
Among the basic numbers 9 is the highest.
As the qualities Number 9 person are closely linked to those of Number 9, let us ascertain the things both abstract and tangible that represent Number 9.
Basically this is a number representing Regeneration, Reformation, Enterprise and Energy.
The other things that Number 9 represents are Triple, Trinity, Evolution, Impulse, Development, Dynamism, Creativity, Liberalism, and Philanthropy.

Peculiarity of Number 9
One peculiarity of Number 9 is when it is added to any other number, the basic number does not change. Add 9 to 2 and the basic number is 2. Add 9 to any other, the basic number remains the same.
Positive and negative qualities
Number 9 is presided over by Mars. When Mars is strong in the natal chart, the subject becomes dynamic, persevering, and pragmatic.
Such subjects are generous, philanthropic, and are endowed with dare and courage. These are the positive qualities of Mars: But when Mars is weak in the natal chart, the native would be self-centered, emotional, indiscreet and retreating.

Endowed with a fighting spirit
Number 9 people are mentally strong, and are endowed with a fighting spirit.
They have to go through the mill, so to speak, in their early years. But they achieve success later in life.
Number 9 people make successful military officers. They also acquit themselves well in positions of command and authority.
The general drawbacks of Number 9 people are quick temper, impatience, rashness, aggressiveness and impulsiveness.
Sincere friends and vindictive enemies
Number 9 people are egoistic and have a propensity to dominate others. They aspire to gain positions of authority.
They are sincere friends, but very vindictive enemies.
Number 9 people born on a Tuesday at the planetary hour of Mars and on the 9th, 18th or 27th of any month, particularly between April 14 and May 15 and between October 16 and November 17 would possess positive qualities of the basic Number 9.

Fitch upgrades  Sri Lanka Insurance Corps national ratings
	
Fitch Ratings has upgraded Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation Limiteds (SLIC) national insurer financial strength (IFS) rating and national long-term rating to AA+(lka) from AA(lka) and assigned a
Stable outlook.
The agency has also affirmed SLICs international IFS rating at B+ with a Stable outlook.
The one-notch upgrade of SLICs national long-term rating and national IFS rating reflects Fitchs more positive view of the states 99.9 percent ownership in the company following a recent proposal to exempt SLIC from the regulatory requirement that all insurers must be listed. As a result, there will be no dilution of the states ownership.
The ratings are also supported by its sound profitability and healthy capitalisation. SLICs ratings also reflect its established franchise and market position in Sri Lanka. Offsetting these strengths are significant investments in non-core subsidiaries and a high equity exposure, which weighs on its risk-based capital.
The IFS rating was affirmed as the rating remains constrained by Sri Lankas sovereign rating
(B+/Stable).
Fitch views SLIC as being important to the government of Sri Lanka due to its ownership and the companys strategic importance as the largest state-owned insurer. The strategic investments that SLIC undertake in line with government policy are a rating weakness.
The company continues to operate as a composite insurer.
SLICs regulatory risk-based capital (RBC) ratios improved to 434 percent for life and 198 percent for non-life by end-March 2017 from 427 percent and 186 percent at end-2016, respectively. These ratios were well above the regulatory minimum of 120 percent for each business and compared well against those ofits peers.
The management expects to maintain RBC ratios above 200 percent in the medium to long term. Pre-tax operating ROA including realised and unrealised gains (2016: 8.1 percent, 2015: 2.9 percent) has been consistently high even after adjusting for dividends received from subsidiaries.
The combined ratio for the non-life business improved to 96 percent in 1H17 after worsening to around 99 percent in 2016 (2015: 93 percent) due to
high competition.
Losses stemming from a severe tropical storm in May 2016 were largely manageable as a result of sound reinsurance arrangements in place. The country faced a similar flood in May 2017, but losses were much lower than in 2016 because the 2016 flooding affected mainly industrial zones in the island.
SLIC has a high risk appetite, which is evident from its large equity investment that exposes the company to market volatility. SLICs total investment in equities (including non-core subsidiaries) was 93 percent of shareholders equity at end-2016 (end-2015: 96 percent). The government has announced that it plans to dispose some of these non-core investments, which were funded by profit retention and include interests in the gas, healthcare, leisure and
banking sectors.
The companys dividend payout ratio increased to 79 percent in 2016, largely due to a high extraordinary dividend received from SLICs subsidiary Litro Gas Lanka Ltd. However, excluding subsidiary dividends, SLICs dividend payouts have increased due to higher dividend expectations from the government.
SLIC is the oldest operating insurer in the country and is supported by an extensive network of branches and strategic business units. The companys asset base of Rs.175 billion at end-2016 accounted for around 35 percent of the insurance sectors assets. SLIC has the second-highest market share in life and non-life businesses as measured by gross written premiums (GWP).

Floods, landslides triggered by heavy rain kill 47 in Nepal
	

THE HINDU, 13th AUGUST, 2017-Landslides and flooding triggered by heavy rain have killed at least 47 people in southern Nepal and left thousands homeless, police said on Sunday.
The death toll was expected to go up, with around two dozen other people missing and feared dead after three days of heavy downpours in at least nine southern districts of the Himalayan country, said police spokesman Pushkar Karki. Around 31,000 families have been displaced by the floods and landslides, which began on Friday, he said.
Police said floodwaters toppled telephone towers and power lines, cutting communications and electricity in many areas.
Rescue efforts were hampered by incessant rain and roads that were washed away in many places. Traffic on Nepals main EastWest highway was stopped after parts of the road and some bridges were severely damaged by the floodwaters.
Teams of soldiers and police officers were working together in the rescue and evacuation efforts, said Ram Krishna Subedi, a home ministry spokesman.

Food Poisoning: Your Stomachs Nemesis
	


Food poisoning is an illness caused by eating contaminated food. Its usually very trivial and just about everybody has experienced it, one way or another. Its also a problem that can be easily avoided. Food poisoning is caused when the food item is contaminated with bacteria (such as Salmonella) or a virus (such as norovirus). It can also be contaminated with heavy metals such as mercury or copper or even chemicals such as pesticides. The symptoms that are experienced during food poisoning are usually vomiting, abdominal pain/cramps and diarrhoea. Dr. Enoka Corea, Senior Lecturer, Department of Microbiology, Faculty of Medicine, Colombo, explained how different types of bacteria can contaminate our food and how this can be prevented in the domestic setting. 

Contamination by bacteria 
Starting off with the different types of bacteria that can cause food poisoning, Dr. Corea said,Food poisoning can occur in many different ways. There are certain bacteria that can make toxins (poisons) in the food itself, so that when you eat the food the toxin or poison is already present and you start getting the symptoms such as vomiting and diarrhoea within 2-6 hours after the meal. Bacteria such as Bacillus cereus and Staphylococcus aureus have the property of producing toxins while multiplying in food. Staphylococcus aureus can multiply in salty foods like ham, cheese and mayonnaise and cause this type of food poisoning whereas Bacillus cereus is seen more commonly in rice . 
There are other bacteria that contaminates food and multiplies only when they enter the intestine, after you eat the food. So it takes a while, maybe 12 to 24 hours, before you get the food poisoning symptoms. Bacteria like Salmonella, which are commonly found in eggs and chicken, are common causes of food poisoning which is why we advise people to boil eggs and cook chicken thoroughly, She continued. 
Moving on to more life threatening bacteria she said,E. coli and Campylobacter are other bacteria that can contaminate food. These can be found in meats when they arent cooked properly. For example, meat in a hamburger or barbeque meat. E. coli has become a problem because there is a particular strain called enterohaemorrhagic E. coli O157:H7 which can actually cause complications that can lead to death. Children die from this, even in the richer parts of the world, because this strain can result in kidney failure and subsequent death. This is a very serious type of food poisoning. Most of the other food poisonings are very trivial. 
Food poisoning doesnt always lead to diarrhoea. If your food is contaminated by botulinum toxin you will have constipation and paralysis rather than diarrhoea and may even die of respiratory failure. Botulism is caused by a bacterium called Clostridium botulinum which is found in the environment. Spores of this bacterium can contaminate your food and then the bacteria can multiply and produce the toxin in your food, especially in badly tinned food. This is one of the most poisonous toxins in the world because tiny amounts (nanograms) can kill you, She added. 


From farm to fork 
Dr. Corea further said that proper preparation of the food is important when preventing food poisoning, starting from the farm. To ensure that the food doesnt get contaminated you have to practice very good farming and animal husbandry. The produce mustnt be contaminated with animal faeces and human sewage shouldnt be used as manure. Even in slaughter houses hygiene needs to be maintained. Then, of course, storing and transport of the meat or vegetables must be done in a proper manner using the correct temperature,Dr. Corea added.
She further explained the measures that can be taken at home. At home, there are some very important things we need to practice in the kitchen. You must always wash your hands and your utensils properly in clean water. You must separate raw food and cooked food. You should also have separate utensils, such as knives, for raw food and cooked food. You must cook your food at the proper temperature for the correct period and either eat it hot or cool it fast and store it in the fridge. You must not keep warm food outside for long periods of time. If you are reusing your food from the fridge you must heat it well before eating. Eggs shouldnt be eaten raw or even half boiled. Never drink raw milk, the milk should always be boiled or pasteurized.Those who are handling the food must maintain good personal hygiene and handle the food properly and carefully. People must never try home canning. If you are going on a holiday to another country you must make sure that you have water or drinks that come in a properly sealed bottle or only drink piping hot drinks. High risk foods are chicken,eggs, barbeque meat, mince meat, shellfish etc. she said. 

Treatment 
Dr. Corea stated that generally there is no specific treatment given for food poisoning. What you must do is replace the fluids you are losing through vomiting and diarrhoea and focus on rehydrating the person. A patient maybe given an antiemetic for the vomiting. You must never give drugs to stop the diarrhoea, because diarrhoea is the protective mechanism and flushes out the food poisoning from your system. Only if the food poisoning leads to blood poisoning-which is very rare-that you will have to take antibiotics. But in general, you dont need to take antibiotics. Most food poisoning is self-limiting and you will feel better after a few hours,she concluded.

GMOA Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge said the government would be spending Rs.3, 000 million annually to maintain the hospital which is greater the than the annual income receiving by the Hambantota Port Deal.
This amount is even higher than the value of the Hambantota Port Deal which is only Rs.1, 800 million. Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne had caused a huge loss to the country by agreeing to take over NFTH, he said. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

Govt. to expedite investigations against MR, family
	
The government has reportedly decided to expedite investigations into allegations faced by former President Mahinda Rajapaksa and his family.
This decision follows complaints lodged with the government by backbench UNPers who pointed out that the investigations against the former president and his family members were proceeding at an extremely slow pace and this despite the government having already completed two and a half years in office.
Several ministers have pointed out that for the government to maintain its credibility it was imperative that action was taken to expedite proceedings against those persons who had allegations of corruption levelled against them immediately. These views were expressed at a cabinet meeting held last week.(Ranjan Kasthuri)

Grandfather brings cobra in plastic container for easy identification
	
A child, who had been bitten by a cobra, had been transferred to two government hospitals before it could be treated with proper anti-venom for cobra bite, sources said.
Staff of the Nawalapitiya hospital was shocked when they saw an elderly man carrying the sick child along with a huge cobra in a plastic container.
The elderly man said the child was bitten by the cobra and that he had brought the snake as well to make it easy for the doctors to identify the serpent.
The doctors at the Nawalapitiya Hospital referred the child to the Kandy General Hospital following preliminary treatment.
The child, a resident of the Laxapana area in Ginigaththena, had been bitten by the cobra when he was playing about near the house.
His parents had left the child to the care of his grandfather and gone to work.
The grandfather, who had heard that in case of a snake bite, it was easy for the doctors if they could precisely identify the snake, had caught the cobra with a noose and brought it to the Laxapana hospital with the child.
The child was first transferred to the Nawalapitiya hospital from where it was transferred to the Kandy General Hospital.
Later, the doctors at the Nawalapitiya hospital called a veterinary surgeon at the Peradeniya veterinary hospital, who took the cobra out of the plastic container, cut the noose and released it into the wild.(Suranga Rajnayake)

HDFC Bank placed on Rating Watch Negative
	
Fitch Ratings has placed Housing Development Finance Corporation Bank of Sri Lankas (HDFC Bank) national long-term rating of BBB(lka)on Rating Watch Negative (RWN).
The agency also placed HDFC Banks senior secured and senior unsecured debentures, rated at BBB(lka), on RWN.
The RWN reflects the risk that the state (B+/Stable), as major shareholder, will not raise the banks capital to meet the minimum Rs.5 billion capital requirement by January 1, 2018, in which case Fitch will downgrade the rating to reflect the banks weaker intrinsic strength.
The requirement has been in force since 2016 and Fitch would see a further delay as an indication that creditors may no longer be able to rely on sovereign support in a timely manner, notwithstanding HDFC Banks unchanged linkages with the state.
HDFCs rating reflects Fitchs expectation that the bank would receive extraordinary support from the sovereign, if required. Our assessment captures the states 51 percent effective holding, of which the National Housing Development Authority directly owns 49 percent, the banks quasi-policy role in supporting housing-development initiatives, as well as HDFC Banks low systemic importance.
Fitch estimates that it would take HDFC Bank more than four years to generate the required capital from retained earnings. Its profitability, in terms of return on assets, has been declining because net-interest margins have been contracting due to higher funding costs stemming from the banks short-tenor deposit base, which reprices regularly and its high-cost business model.
The banks profitability, funding and liquidity could also be affected by business restrictions imposed by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL). Fitch expects HDFC Banks asset and liability mismatches to persist due to its longer-tenor loan book and short-tenor deposit base. Its deposit base is also highly concentrated.
Housing loans, mainly to low- and middle-income customers, continue to dominate the banks loan book, accounting for 81 percent at end-1Q17 (2014: 91 percent).
Housing loans to members of the Employees Provident Fund (EPF), which are secured against members EPF balances, accounted for 24 percent of the banks total loans. Non-performing loans (NPL) to EPF members are higher than for the rest of the banks portfolio, but the CBSL annually reimburses HDFC Bank for EPF-backed loans in arrears for more than three months. The reported gross NPL ratio remained high 18.8 percent or 8.9 percent excluding EPF-backed loans, at end-1Q17.
The banks outstanding debentures are rated in line with its national long-term rating and rank equally with the claims of other senior unsecured creditors. Fitch has not provided any rating uplift for the collateralisation on the senior secured debentures as their recovery prospects are considered to be average and comparable with those of the unsecured notes in a developing legal system.

## Title: How to select a walking aid!

How to select a walking aid!
	
In this article, I will attempt to simply explain about the great benefits of using walking aids. Walking aids or assistive devices help people with joint/movement problems to mobilise better. These devices also prevent falls and ease out joint pain by reducing the weight placed on leg joints. 
Walking, although simple, as it might seem, is a complex movement. The leg joints are moved in a rhythmic fashion to propel you forward and the swinging hands support this movement all throughout. The centre of gravity is the exact point through which the weight of the body falls through. The brain balances all movements, so that the centre of gravity doesnt shift way too forward; which will make you fall on your face or shift backwards and make you fall on your back.  Have you ever seen an old person, struggling to take a few steps They are in constant doubt whether they will fall or have joint pain. This overcautious approach to walking creates problems.  Mammals are mostly four legged.
They are stable on four feet. Evolution made us two legged, but with these great powers came several disadvantages. But then again humans, having the ability to solve problems, came up with the idea of using walking aids. These have been in existence for thousands of years. They initially came as simple canes, something which is confirmed when you study the ancient Egyptian pyramid carvings. 
What does it do
There are three things that walking aids (Assistive devices) do. They broaden the patients base of support, improve balance/stability and redistribute the weight so that the joint pain eases. There are a few goals that I target by prescribing walking aids. These are to improve confidence when walking, delay the decline in function of the elderly, reduce disability and also to reduce the burden on caregivers. 
There is research evidence in abundance to show that walkers boost the confidence of patients. They make their users independent as well. 
Nevertheless, the assistive device can adversely affect ones balance as well. The act of lifting and placing the device at a more forward position can itself cause the patient to fall. Also repetitively using the device can cause pain in arm joints and tendons and give rise to a condition called carpal tunnel syndrome. (A nerve gets trapped at the level of your wrist) Therefore, it should be carefully selected, ideally with the help of a joint specialist. 

How to use it
I will explain this in detail, but first of all I would like to highlight certain research findings on the improper use of canes. Studies have revealed that nearly 70 percent of cane/walking sticks in use are damaged, faulty or dont have the propper height. 
Only one third of the patients in the west obtained their device through a medical professional. And out of that only 20 percent received knowledge on how to use them! More than one half of the canes had worn out rubber caps, were used on the wrong side or the height was excessive. And the sad side of the story is nearly 30 to 50 percent of patients stopped using the assistive device within weeks after purchase as they never received instructions regarding usage. 
So on which side should you keep the walking stick Its always on the good side. For example if you have a bad right knee and a relatively normal left knee, the walking stick should be used on the LEFT SIDE (Good side). And what is the ideal height The handle of the walking stick should be at the level of the crease of your waist. When using the stick, the elbow should be bent in such a way that the angle between the arm and forearm is 150 to 165 degrees. 
The walking stick is moved together with the problematic leg. Eg-If the patient has a bad knee or hip on the left side, the walking stick is held on the right hand and moved together with the left leg. The intact or good leg moves independently. Even when climbing stairs, the painful leg moves together with the walking stick and the good leg moves independently. This is the correct way a cane should be used. 

Types ofwalking aids
There are many types of devices and you should select the one that helps you the most. 
Standard cane  Made of wood or aluminum. They are light in weight and popular as the aluminum ones are adjustable. 
Offset cane  This has a curvature along the upper part which distributes the weight to the lower part in a different manner. Suits people who depend more on the arms to mobilise and with knee osteoarthritis. 
Four legged cane  This is for greater weight bearing force as it provides a very stable base. All four legs should be in contact with the ground. Useful for patients who have suffered strokes with weaknesses in one side of the body  The handles of canes ideally should be flat and horizontal. The umbrella handles arent recommended as they can cause a condition called carpal tunnel syndrome.  Now lets discuss about crutches. Crutches bear weight and two crutches can sometimes offload both legs of the entire body weight. 
Axillary crutches (Arm pit crutches)  The cheap traditional pair of crutches that can sometime apply pressure on nerves/blood vessels at the armpit. These are difficult to use. 
Forearm crutches  Have cuffs to fit around the forearms and hand grips to hold on to. Patients using them are less likely to fall because one can rely on the cuff while performing tasks using hands. 
Next we will discuss about walkers. Walkers are meant for patients who have great difficulty in walking. They improve mobility by increasing the base of support. They might prohibit the patient from moving fast and are clumsy to use when climbing stairs. 
Standard walker  Has four legs and no wheels. The patient has to always lift and place the walker in front to move forward. Not suitable for patients with Parkinsons disease. 
Front wheeled walker  This has two wheels on the front. The hind legs have rubber caps. It is good for patients with diseases like Parkinsons where lifting the walker off the ground is difficult. Stability with this type of walker is less as it can slide forward on certain instances. 
Four wheeled walker with handbrakes  Also called Rollators,these are very popular in western countries, but not so popular in Sri Lanka, a land of rough terrain! Its very easy to propel! But it can be slid forwards and become unstable at times. Brakes are designed, so that one can fully lock the wheels. There is a built in miniature seat as well. Its very useful for patients with heart or lung disease, who need an occasional rest. Its not good in terms of bearing weight. 
Always consult your specialist before purchasing the appropriate walking aid/ assistive device. Ideally proper training sessions in walking should be provided to the patient by the doctor prior to the walking aid being put to use. Assistive devices in correct hands provide patients a whole new set of exploring possibilities!

## Title: I spy with my stye eye!

I spy with my stye eye!
	

Eyes are very important organs that deserve that extra effort to be taken care of. When considering medical complications related to the eyes, the list includes both harmless to harmful conditions that could even lead to blindness. A very general eye issue that many people face is styes. Dr. M. Wijetunge, retired Consultant Eye Surgeon of the Ragama Teaching Hospital, explained what styes are and provided answers to generally posed questions that spring up in peoples minds in connection with eye styes. 

Definition
A stye, also known as a hordeolum, is an infection of an oil gland in the eye lid. A stye is a red, tender bump seen at the edge of the eyelid. A stye could appear either inside or outside the eyelid. The eyelashes of the eye comprises lash follicles. These follicles contain sebaceous glands. When these glands get blocked and infected, they lead to styes, explained Dr. Wijetunge. Individuals belonging to any age group can be infected with this infection. Styes can recur in people more than once. In most cases they are harmless and tend to heal taking their own time. 

Causes 
The usual cause for styes is a bacterial infection. The infection is caused by the bacteria Staphylococcus aureus, but is also triggered by various reasons such as poor nutrition, sleep deprivation, lack of water, improper eye hygiene or rubbing of eyes. Dusty surroundings, use of eye cosmetics such as eye liners and even dandruff could lead to stye formations in the eyes,Dr. Wijetunge stressed.

Symptoms 
Dr. Wijetunge listed the clear telltale signs of a stye. A lump on the top or bottom eyelid, localised swelling of the eyelid, pain and redness are common signs of styes, Dr. Wijetunge said. Others include tenderness, irritation of the eye, light sensitivity, tearing and discomfort during blinking . 

Care and treatment 
Dr. Wijetunge stated that a stye usually vanishes on its own without any specific treatment. It could last for a few days or weeks. Warm compressing and gentle massaging of the eye, antibiotic eye ointment or oral antibiotics help treat styes. Cleansing the irritated eye with tap water or mild non-irritating soap such as baby soap is also a step that can be followed. Cleansing must be done gently, explained Dr. Wijetunge. Proper eye hygiene should be followed. Its also recommended not to use eye makeup such as eyeliners, etc , when having developed a stye. The use of lotions and contact lenses are also advised against, as they could aggravate the infection and spread the infection to the cornea in some instances. 

Prevention 
The answer to the stye issue is following proper eye hygiene. Washing hands is very vital, not just to prevent styes, but also to avoid other infections. Applying a warm wash cloth on the eyelids helps reduce the tendency to get infected and thereby prevent the development of styes in the eyes. Through this method the contents of the oil glands of the eyes are kept in fluidity avoiding blockages. Washing the eyes daily with soap water is a good practice to follow, advised Dr. Wijetunge. Its also further recommended to never share eye cosmetic products and tools with others. The removal of makeup every night is advised along with the discarding of old and contaminated eye makeup. Sharing of face towels is a definite no as it could spread the infection among individuals. Dr. Wijetunge also mentioned that if a person suffers from dandruff, appropriate steps must be taken to avoid the condition as the use of an anti-dandruff shampoo, as dandruff, could also lead to the formation of styes. 

Can it lead to other complications 
Styes are generally harmless, but there are rare cases of complications as well. So if a stye condition doesnt tend to heal or if the condition worsens in a matter of weeks, its advised to seek medical treatment. Large styes have to be drained out as they can hinder vision.The most frequent stye complication is the development of the stye to a chalazion. This condition (Chalazions) often requires surgical removal as it could cause cosmetic deformities and
corneal irritation. 
Another possible complication of eye styes is eyelid cellulitis.

Is the relationship with your inhaler a good one
	


Its time to clear the air regarding the little plastic lifesaver-better known as the inhaler- you use. The inhaler is another simple yet invaluable invention of modern medicine. This gadget makes taking treatment for lung conditions less of an encumbrance for both the doctor and the patient. But despite being around for decades, there are still so many misconceptions surrounding inhalers. In addition, a research done in UK has revealed that one in three patients who are using inhalers arent using them properly. 
I remember once a consultant physician recalling his experience while being abroad, where an asthmatic patient-whose symptoms hadnt improved despite the prescribed inhaler- came to him. Yes, she was using the inhaler and twice a day as the doctors recommended. However, when asked to demonstrate how she was using the inhaler, she took out the device and spritz  spritz, sprayed the medicinal cloud under her armpits. Even though our readers are much more aware of the medical world behind them, there are so many little things that can go wrong while using the inhaler. There are also the shadows and the myths that need to be brought to light when making references to this topic.We hope this article will be of some use to both the users of inhalers and the ones who were advised to use an inhaler, but are reluctant, due to various reasons.

Correct use

If you are prescribed an inhaler, make sure that the healthcare worker instructs on the correct method of inhaler use before you leave the clinic.  Take the device with you on your next visit, so that they can review your method of using the inhaler. 
If your inhaler is to be used when you get the symptoms, make sure to keep it with you at all times, because you may need it at the most unexpected time.  Following the exact dose that your doctor recommends is essential. If the doctor recommended two puffs, dont use more than that, because this may cause an overdose of the drug.


Get the best
When you visit a pharmacy, it has on display inhaler devices that come in various designs and a spectrum of colours.Though the choices are overwhelming, your doctor will help you find the best match for yourself. This is done by considering factors like the severity of the disease, age, occupation and affordability. 
All these fancy gadgets can be divided into two groups. Metered Dose Inhalers (MDI) are the commonest and consist of a canister and a plastic holder. The canister contains the medication with a propellent, which, when pressed, deliveres medication in aerosol form. 
The other group is the Dry Powder Inhaler, otherwise known as the DP-haler. These come in various sizes, shapes and trade names, such as turbohaler, accuhaler, cyclohaler etc. With regard to these, you either have to insert a capsule with the powdered medicine or the device will contain a specific number of doses of medicine. They dont have a propeller and depend on the force of the patients inhalation to get medicine into the lungs. 


MDI with spacer device
In cases where the patient is too old or ill or in the case of children, where the above instructions cant be followed, you will be prescribed a transparent bubble like device called a spacer along with the MDI. After attaching the mouthpiece of the inhaler to the spacer device, the drug will be directly delivered to the chamber of the spacer, so you can take smaller more regular puffs of breaths through the mouthpiece of the spacer or through a face mask. 

Avoiding common errors
Make sure that air doesnt escape from around your lips when you are using the device 
	Inhale through your mouth and not through the nose 
	Try to press the canister simultaneously during inhalation to get the maximum dose of the drug into the lungs 
	After inhaling the medicine, hold your breath for around 30 seconds to allow the drug to disperse in your lungs 
	Make sure that the canister isnt empty by checking it periodically.
	
Dispelling myths
Some are reluctant to use inhalers, preferring to continue with oral drugs, thinking they will get addicted to the inhaler. These patients also believe that using the inhaler will make them experience side effects.
Oral medication for a lung condition has to be absorbed from the gut. Its then only that a small percentage of it will be delivered to the lung via blood.
Therefore the dose of the drug that needs to be given to make a clinical effect is comparatively high, unlike with inhalers, where a smaller dose is needed because the drug is directly delivered to the affected site.
Therefore the side effects are much lower compared to the same medication taken orally. Inhaled drugs also act faster and therefore are more suited in the case of acute asthma attacks. 
Inhaler users, whose medications contain steroids, are more liable to get oral thrush. This can be avoided by gargling the mouth well after using the device. Most other side effects are experienced as a result of the drug and not because of the inhaler itself. Children on long term inhaler therapy should be monitored for their growth.
The adults who are on steroids will have an increased risk of osteoporosis among other things and also need monitoring. 
Medicine, weather its western or ayurvedic, arent without side effects. But rather than avoiding taking treatment altogether- for the fear of side effects- its essential to find the point of balance where the therapeutic effects of treatment out weight its bad effects. If we do this the quality of lives would improve drastically.

U.S. President Donald Trumps surprise comments on the Friday may bring the beleaguered Maduro some respite in the region, just as Venezuela was the on verge of becoming a pariah over its recent installation of a legislative superbody, widely condemned as a power grab by the ruling Socialists. 
Following Trumps assertion that military intervention in Venezuela was an option, Maduros critics are caught between backing the idea of a foreign invasion of Venezuela or supporting a president they call a dictator.

Marrying a foreigner or someone outside your community
	
By Sandagomi
A large majority of people in our country still seem to believe in the conventional marriage judging by the contents of numerous marriage proposals advertised in the national weeklies these days.
Parents choosing a life partner
In most of these cases, it is the parents who seek a partner for their son or daughter and they invariably make it a point to mention their ethnicity, religion and caste indicating preference for a bride or a bridegroom from the same community.
Parental initiative takes a back seat
However, there is a growing trend among parents to allow leeway for their children to marry a partner of their choice regardless of ethnic, religious or caste compatibility. Very often, nowadays young men and women meet and fall in love and later seek parental consent to tie the knot. While, the inter-caste and inter-racial marriages are on the increase now, yet another type of unconventional marriage has entered the equation: either a love relationship or marriage with a foreigner.
Foreigners turning bridegrooms
The local- foreigner relationships have begun to increase of late with more and more foreign nationals visiting the country as tourists, investors, and resource personnel on foreign-funded development projects. Another factor contributing to the increase of this type of unconventional marriage is more and more Sri Lankans securing employment in Mid-east and in certain developed countries mostly in the West.
Our present purpose is to discuss the Astrological factors that lead to a local marrying a foreigner throwing all conventions to the four winds.
Rahus role in unconventional marriages
Vedic Astrologers credit Rahu, the shadow planet with causing unconventional marriages, those with foreigners in particular.
Rahu, in fact, is believed to be playing an important role connecting a native with everything foreign. Rahu also plays a major role in timing the unconventional marriages. For instance, a marriage with a foreigner would take place either in the major Dasa period of Rahu or in his sub-Dasa period in the major Dasa lord of the 7th House.
Planetary positions signifying an unconventional marriage
Given below are a few planetary positions that lead to marriage with a foreigner.
The lord of the 7th house in the 12th House or vice versa points to a marriage with a foreigner and taking up residence abroad.
	The lord of the 12th House posited in the 4th House while being aspected by Venus or the lord of the 7th House signifies marriage with a foreigner and living abroad.
	The lord of the 12th house in the 7th House with the lord of the 4th House indicates marrying a foreigner.
	Rahu occupying either the 12th House or the 6th House in the Rashi, Sapthamsa and Navamsa charts would cause the native to marry a foreigner.
	The 12th lord either from the Moon or the Lagna placed in the asterism (Nakshatra) of Rahu would lead to marrying a foreigner.
	Venus, either posited with or aspected by Rahu in the 2nd or the 12th position to each other in the Navamsa chart indicates marriage with a foreigner.

MYTH: You can only solve your hiccups by drinking water. 


BUSTED: There are other ways to cure common hiccups, such as holding your breath. A hiccup occurs when there is an involuntary contraction of your diaphragm muscles. There are two nerve supplies to the diaphragm; the unconscious nerve supply and the other is conscious. So stimulation of the vagus nerve, which is one of the nerves connected to the diaphragm, can stop the hiccup. Measures taken to stop and counteract the hiccup are associated with activating the nerve. So stimulation, in the form of holding the breath, contracts the diaphragm. Adopting this method amounts to doing a counter maneuver to the hiccup, so that may help, explained Professor Arjuna de Silva, Professor in Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Ragama.

On the trail of people with eating disorders
	


There is no doubt that all of us love to have a perfect body with the ideal height and weight. Such bodies have super perfect features and are sharp and toned as well. Of course such an asset can boost our self-confidence. Thanks to social media, we do care about the waywe look morethan before.
According to the latest research studies, the new generations are found to be under so much pressure they tend to carry out bizarre practices in order to achieve a dream appearance. 
In this article, we are going to talk about eating disorders and their nature, so that the next time you witness someone with weird eating habits, it wont be difficult to identify what he is suffering from in order to offer help. 
Anorexia Nervosa and Bulimia Nervosa are so far the commonest, clinically recognized eating disorders identified among people. These eating disorders account for 2/3rds of the individual cases. These people are overly attentive about getting fat and make extreme restrictions on their dietary plans, in order to avoid gaining weight. Also, if there is a failure in maintaining their diet in the expected manner, due to some reason, they get very irritated, upset and reach a psychologically disturbed state. 

What is Anorexia Nervosa
Anorexia Nervosa, is a type of eating disorder where affected individuals tend to avoid food, due to the fear of gaining weight. While there is a significant female predominance, teenagers are known to be the most vulnerable age group. 
Main clinical features 
Fearful thoughts about becoming fat 
	Feeling themselves as obese even if they have become emaciated 
	Refusal to maintain a body weight, which is ideal for age and height and instead trying to lose weight in various extreme ways, such as extensive exercise to burn fat, avoiding food containing carbohydrates and fats, using laxatives or diuretics and cutting down food into small pieces, which will reduce the overall food intake. 

Additionally, anorectic people are considered to be perfectionists and introverts most of the time. They have a history of maintaining poor relationships with others, suffer from low self-esteem, anxiety and depression. More importantly, when people around them question their weird pattern of meals and behaviour, they tend to become extremely rude, irritated and angry. Therefore, they usually become secretive about their lifestyles and prefer to be alone and isolated. 
Even though the exact cause for Anorexia Nervosa hasnt been identified yet, its believed to be a disorder associated with culture, occupation, family history, relationship, negative life events and stressful situations. 

What is Bulimia Nervosa
Bulimia, refers to an eating disorder which is characterized by bingeing on food (eating a large amount of food in a short period of time) which is followed by purging in order to avoid weight gain. Teenagers and women are the most affected group of people. Bulimia often starts during early twenties and lasts until adulthood as a chronic disorder. 
A patient is more vulnerable to have the disease if the family members are obese or having eating disorders, a career which stresses about body size ( ballerinas, models), wanting to imitate media personals who have slim bodies, perfectionism (wanting the life to be perfect and worries about little things) or stressful life events. People with Bulimia are very conscious of their weight and body shape and they try to stick to strict diet plans to lose weight. But when they get hungry after a long period of starving they tend to binge eat. After their meals, feelings of shame, guilt, distress and worry about gaining weight will eventually make them purge. 
They may also try to misuse laxatives, enemas and diuretics. The other special thing about these affected individuals is they arent thin but, normal in body size and they tend to binge eat and purge secretly and always deny that they do so. 
Complications 
Gum disorders 
	Tooth decay 
	Loss of tooth enamel due to acid in the mouth as a result of frequent vomiting 
	Osteoporosis (due to purging) 
	Damage to esophagus due to frequent vomiting and acid reflux 

The difference
Lets focus on the individuals weight and the behaviour after having meals with regard to anorexic people. Such people are very thin or emaciated most of the time and their menstrual cycle is often disturbed by the long term inadequate food intake. On the other hand, Bulimic people usually have an average weight ideal for their height and age or are sometimes obese. 
Meals of Anorexic people arent very heavy or followed by purging like those of Bulimic people. Instead they prefer to starve or eat less.

The process of making a Constitution for South Africa: Tremendous task of  bringing together eleven
	
- Justice Dikgang Moseneke
Former Deputy Chief Justice Moseneke receiving a memento from the Acting Vice Chancellor, Professor E. Lakshman Wijeweera

A rapt audience of University Dons and students of the Faculty of Law, heard Justice Dikgang Moseneke, former Deputy Chief Justice of the South African Constitutional Court, say that he thought that they did not know he was an ex Con, when a question was raised by the audience as to his contact with the icon Mandela. 
Former Justice Moseneke said it was a tremendous task to bring together eleven languages to one platform in the process of making a Constitution for South Africa. He also said the National Anthem represents the major languages of four, by having each verse for one of the languages. What is there so cumbersome to draw up a Constitution for Sri Lanka where there are only two major languages, he questioned, when South Africa could bring about a Constitution for eleven languages of the country onto one platform, Constitutional reforms hold significance in the reconciliation of transitional societies. The post-apartheid South Africas Constitution-making process is one of the most successful and inspirational Constitution making processes of the world. 
Former Deputy Chief Justice Dikgang Moseneke is an eminent judge of South Africa, who was engaged in activism at a young age and therefore had experienced the process and impact of the Constitution-making in South Africa in different perspectives. At a time whern Sri Lanka is also going through the Constitution-making phase of the reconciliation process, it is important to share the experience of South Africa in using the Constitution as a tool to bring divided communities together. 
The Department of Law, Faculty of Arts in the University of Peradeniya in collaboration with the Commonwealth Secretariat Technical Assistance Mission to Sri Lanka, conducted this dialogue with Judge Dikgang Moseneke on the South African experience regarding the Constitution-making in polarized societies, in order to disseminate knowledge on the significance of Constitution making in transitional communities. 

"The National Anthem represents the major languages of four, by having each verse for one of the languages. What is there so cumbersome to draw up a Constitution for Sri Lanka where there are only two major languages, he questioned"

Justice Dikgang Moseneke practised as an Advocate in Johannesburg and Pretoria, and was elevated to the status of Senior Counsel in 1993. He served on the technical committee that drafted the interim Constitution of 1993, and was appointed Deputy Chairperson of the Independent Electoral Commission; which conducted the first democratic election in South Africa. After serving as a judge of the High Court in Pretoria, he was appointed as a judge in the Constitutional Court and in June 2005 as the Deputy Chief Justice of the Republic of South Africa. 
The discussion at Peradeniya focused on the challenges and achievements of the difficult Constitution making process in South Africa as it transited from apartheid into a pluralist democracy. Justice Moseneke emphasized the significance of Constitutional reforms in the reconciliation process under one of the pillars of transitional justice: the guarantees of non-recurrence. 
He said special attention was also given to the mandate and performance of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) of South Africa; which is the only truth commission to have been given powers of amnesty. 
At the rostrum - Professor Lakshman Wijeweera with the delegates 
Justice Moseneke narrated his experience on the drafting process of the South African Constitution. The audience was fascinated to hear how people from different backgrounds were brought onto a single platform to map the future of South Africa by drafting the Constitution. The debate that occurred during the Constitution drafting phase between the recognition of individual rights and group rights were discussed. Special attention was also given to the mandate and performance of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) of South Africa; which is the only truth commission to have been given powers of amnesty. 
This dialogue was held at the Senate Room of the University of Peradeniya, chaired by the Acting and also the Deputy Vice Chancellor of the University Professor R. Lakshman Wijeweera. 
The Head of the Faculty of Law and Senior Lecturer Dr. (Ms) Samanmala Dorabawila introduced former Judge Moseneke. 
Among those who were present were Constitutional Court Advocate Karen McKenzie of South Africa, Counsellor Johannes Van Niekark of the South Afrian High Commission, Head of Human Rights Sumedha Ekanayake and Human Rights Adviser Eleanor Paton were among those present with Ambassador of South Africa Ms.Robina P. Marks. Saman Ratwatte PC was also present.

Video circulating on social media shows IGP manhandling Police HQ staff
	
A video posted by a popular gossip website Lanka e News (LEN) was circulating on social media showing Police Chief Pujith Jayasundara manhandling two minor staffers of the Police Headquarters, who claimed to have disobeyed departmental rules of performing the morning meditation.
Although the video has been posted on the LEN website this morning following a written description pertaining to the visuals it carried, the actual incident depicted on the footage had reportedly taken place on April 11 this year, as mentioned by the gossip site.
The video which seemed to have been captured from the Police Headquarters CCTV cameras fixed in and outside the main elevator of the lobby shows Mr. Jayasundara manhandling a person in civvies by his shirt collar and threateningly gestures to slap another man in plain clothing who acts as the lift operator.
In the second frame it shows the IGP pointing his finger at someone whos remaining beyond the cameras point of view and blaming in a dramatic style.
Although the audio of the footage was not available it was evident that he was expressing his displeasure at the junior staffers.
When contacted Police Spokesman SP Ruwan Gunasekara told the Daily Mirror this was a trivial incident where the IGP as the head of the department reprimanded some staffers who had failed to adhere to the morning meditation sessions.
To cultivate good thoughts and sound mindset of all policemen a ten minute meditation session has been introduced by IGP Jayasundara since assuming office in April last year.
The session is held every morning at 8.30 to 8.45 right after playing national anthem and police anthem. All Buddhists have been instructed to engage in the meditation session whilst the rest of the non-Buddhists had been asked to observe their religious prayers within this period.
This rule had been enforced on all policemen in Police Headquarters and police stations countrywide.
However, those assigned on special duties such as at 119 emergency telephone service, sentry and guard points as well as policemen in charge of receiving complaints at respective stations are exempted from practising this morning rule as it would disturb the general public, the spokesman said.
Since this novel concept is embraced by many optimistic policemen in the department and follow with heart and soul it had helped to make a revolutionary change in the way how police officers approach their daily duties with a sound and positive mindset.
During the period this meditation is practiced and except for those who are exempted from following it, there shouldnt be any activity or movement of staffers allowed within the department including the lift operator. Since nobody is moving during this period it was questionable as to why the lift operator had disobeyed to practice his meditation, SP Gunasekara said.
Emphasizing on certain admirable qualities of the incumbent Police Chief, SP Gunasekara said the former had managed to clear over 8, 000 personal files of various grievances of police officers which had been stagnating for over a decade, within a year of his appointment.
He said he would personally testify that as the Director of Police Discipline and Conduct Division, the IGP had given solutions to all these grievances pertaining to the promotions, transfers, delayed justice of inquiries, pensions etc.
Meanwhile, attempts made to get through to IGP Jayasundara over the phone for his comment was unsuccessful. (Kurulu Koojana Kariyakarawana)
