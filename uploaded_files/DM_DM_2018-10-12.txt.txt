A fox guarding the henhouse
	

A leading political authority has reportedly appointed a black-listed shady character as the head of a financial institution at the periphery.

This discredited character had earlier worked in several banks some of which he had to leave under a cloud.
The man had taken to politics after being compelled to quit the banking sector and had campaigned tirelessly for the political authority in question at the last Diyawanna poll while functioning as the opposition leader of a mini-local body.
Meanwhile, some TU leaders are said to be putting up a brief for the political authority saying that he had made the appointment not knowing the mans track record and adding that action was being taken to relieve him of the high post he had been offered.

A money guzzling road project!
	

The development work on a proposed five-kilometre four-lane- stretch of a road in the main city being represented by a leading politico, taken on hand three years ago is yet to be completed.

This project to develop the road stretch was undertaken under a crash development programme launched under the theme, Let us wake up to develop our city and though a hefty amount running into several billions of rupees has already been spent on this it is yet far behind its schedule, they say.
Meanwhile, the authorities have failed so far to pay compensation to about 1,400 residents, whose lands and other properties were acquired for the widening of the road.
Appeals made by the residents to the authorities concerned to expedite the compensation payments have fallen on deaf ears, they say.

A rare case of extravagance!
	

A nephew of a high political authority has reportedly bought an expensive wristwatch for Rs. 8 million.

This person had bought the costly wristwatch during a visit to the Land of the Rising Sun, they say.
He had developed the craze to wear the wristwatch of the highly expensive model after hearing that a leading politico in a country in the West was sporting a similar wristwatch.
The owner of the multimillion wristwatch is said to be a wealthy businessman, who had made his start with a humble tea boutique.

As a Buddhist I feel sad for Duminda: Hirunika
	
Referring to the Supreme Courts confirmation of the death sentence imposed on Duminda Silva, UNP MP Hirunika Premachandra said today as a Buddhist she felt sorry for him but as a was happy at the court ruling.
The SC on Thursday confirmed the death sentence imposed by the High Court on Duminda and two others who were convicted of the murder of former presidential adviser Bharatha Lakshman Premachandra.
She told a news briefing that she was extremely thankful to the five-judge bench of the Supreme Court who gave the verdict.
This is a historical verdict given by the SC where the independence of the judiciary was clearly seen. If this verdict was to be given during Mahinda Rajapaksa regime, Duminda would have been freed, the MP said.
Meanwhile, she said she was contemplating about lodging a complaint against the FCID over the allegation levelled against her about Rs.20 million given by the Welfare Society of the Maga Neguma Construction Equipment Company to fund her political activities.
I have not been engaged in such third class work. This is a alleged attempt to tarnish my name because I have just started my political career, the MP said. (Sheain Fernandopulle)

Caretaker government Who is fooling whom
	
President Sirisena was furious about the Central Bank bond scam
Was displeased with the way the UNP was managing the economy
Political parties in the country are obsessed these days with speculation about a caretaker Government that is to be jointly formed by the joint opposition headed by former president Mahinda Rajapaksa and the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) headed by President Maithripala Sirisena. 
The speculation got wings after some news items over the matter published in last Sundays newspapers saying that a discussion had been held between the former and the present Presidents on this matter. 
The speculation is being floated with people calling the Government that is said to be under discussion by various names such as caretaker Government (Bharakara Aanduwa), coalition Government (Sabhaga Aanduwa) and interim Government (Antharwara Aanduwa). 
Except for the report in The Sunday Times, all stories in other weekend newspapers on the matter were very vague and too speculative, whereas The Sunday Times report was specific in respect of the participants, venue, and the details of the discussion on the caretaker Government. 
It said that the discussion had taken place on October 3 at the Battaramulla residence of former minister S.B. Dissanayake, who was one of the 16 SLFP parliamentarians, who resigned from the government after supporting the no confidence motion against Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe in April.

According to that story, former economic development minister Basil Rajapaksa has also participated in the discussion where a proposal to appoint Mahinda Rajapaksa as the Prime Minister replacing Wickremesinghe until the next Parliamentary election had been discussed. It must be remembered that Basil Rajapaksa cut short his recent visit to his home in Los Angeles after a call by his brother, the former President to return to the country immediately.
During the talks, according to The Sunday times, President Sirisena had said that the Prime Minister was scuttling many of his efforts and it was extremely difficult to work with him. 
However, this was not a new complaint by the President as it was a well-known fact that he had attempted to remove Mr. Wickremesinghe from the post of Prime Minister in the wake of the February 10 LocalGovernment elections.
The speculation got wings after some news items over the matter published in the last Sunday newspapers saying that a discussion had been held between the former and the present Presidents on this matter

It was also said that at the time the President had sought the opinion of the Attorney General on whether there were provisions in the Constitution to remove the Prime Minister. 
The current scenario is similar to what emerged in the wake of the LG election in February
The President who has been openly criticizing the Prime Minister and the UNP during the LG election campaign has allowed or persuaded his ministers then to negotiate with the Joint Opposition on the possibility of forming a new government. Then the broker for the patch- up effort between the SLFP and the JO was Susil Premajayantha who was then a Cabinet minister. He even discussed the matter with the JO Parliamentary group. The JO suggested to form a minority Government by the SLFP with them supporting from outside. The former President did not prefer his group to take ministerial posts. 
On February 21, the SLFP even announced its divorce from the UNP, bringing up the speculation of a SLFP Government with the support of the JO to a peak. But ludicrously, the SLFP announced next day that it would remain in the Government with the UNP, shattering all hopes of the JO to control the government. The reason cited for the backpedalling by the SLFP was the uncertainity about the numbers needed to form such a Government which was an obvious fact from the beginning. 
But the former president and S.B. Dissanayake had denied that a meeting had been held with the President at Dissanayakes residence. However, the UNP seems to have taken the story seriously. UNP Deputy Leader Sajith Premadasa, in an effort to rekindle the enmity between the President and the former president had recalled a statement made by President Sirisena that he would have been six feet underground had he lost the 2015 presidential election. Premadasa, while praising the President for taking such a risk at the presidential election said the President would not betray the mandate given by the people just for the sake of a caretaker government. And as happened after the LG election some UNP leaders have started to express their willingness to form a Government of their own. 
However, as it had been evident soon after the LG elections, the possibility of forming an alternative to the current SLFP-UNP coalition government seems to be extremely remote, given the strength of the parties in the Parliament. 
Whether the efforts for a caretaker government would end up in fruition or not, all three groups involved in it seem to have different objectives. They will attempt to reach their respective targets, irrespective of what the fate of the proposed caretaker Government is. 
It is the Presidents displeasure with the Prime Minister that has been cited as the main reason for the President to revive his efforts to find an alternative to his coalition with the UNP. The ill-feeling between the President and the UNP has been growing since early 2016. The President had even accused the UNP of defending the corrupt leaders of the former regime and instrumental in delaying and stalling of high profile corruption cases against them. 
The media reported last year that he had lamented at a meeting with UNP leaders that it was he and not the latter who would have to face the consequences of these delays, in the case of a comeback by the Rajapaksas. Also he was furious over the Central Bank bond scam which many UNP leaders had been attempting to cover-up while defending the culprits. 
This is the second time in Sri Lankas history when the Prime Minister is seemingly acting independently of the executive President. A similar situation prevailed when the same UNP leader held the post of Prime Minister during President Chandrika Kumaratungas tenure. Thus, the President seems to have given vent to his frustration over some of the UNP ministers taking decisions ignoring him. He reversed some of those decisions such as the one to allow women to work at liquor shops, by using his executive powers. 
Later he expressed his displeasure with the way the UNP was managing the economy and replaced the Economic Management Committee headed by the Prime Minister with the National Economic Council (NEC) headed by him. Knowing very well that he is unable to oust the UNP from the Government becuase it has the most number of seats in Parliament, he is appearing to at least to tame the UNP. 
On the other hand, a seasoned politician that he is, Rajapaksa also knows that his group and the group headed by the President do not have the necessary numbers in the Parliament to form a government. But he seems to be in a move to pressure the Government to resign by breaking up the ruling coalition, using the Presidents aversion towards the UNP. Hence, he demands the withdrawal of the SLFP from the coalition with the UNP, as a condition for a caretaker government. 
The third group that badly needs a patch-up between the president and the former president is the 16 SLFP MPs including S.B. Dissanayake, who have been left destitute after resigning from the Government in April. They were neither allowed by the UNP to cling on to their ministerial posts nor were they welcomed into the former Presidents fold. Thus their only hope seems to be a patch-up between the two factions of the UPFA. 
Therefore, the attempts to form a caretaker government seem to be nothing but another round of efforts by the concerned stakeholders to hoodwink each other.

Coalition government: MR says only a proposal on the table
	
Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa yesterday said at present there was only a proposal on the table to form a coalition government and re-iterated that there had been no discussions in this regard as yet.
Responding to a question raised by a journalist at the Abhayaramaya in Colombo, Mr. Rajapaksa said there was only a proposal on the table at the moment.
We want to intervene to prevent a crisis in the country in order to help the people. However, there is no talk of a coalition government. There is only a proposal. We dont know until it happens and the chances of it happening are extremely slim. However, if a proposal comes from that side, then we can decide on it as a party, he said.
When asked about the fuel price increase, he said no one even knew anything about the fuel pricing formula or how it is calculated. What is this formula Neither the President nor the Prime Minister know about this formula. Even the Finance Minister has said he doesnt know it so then who is supposed to knowThe rupee depreciation is also a cause for this fuel price increase. This clearly shows the the government is incapable of running the country, he said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

Coming out of this Fools Paradise
	
The dwindling Rupee has jerked the Yahapalana (Good Governance) government wide awake to face the reality they preferred to ignore. Since assuming office in January 2015 and promising a better managed economy and jobs, comfortable living and social stability, the yahapalana rulers are now told by a depreciating Rupee that they have completely failed. On a heavily depreciated Rupee, President Sirisena is now speculating whether to give into Rajapaksas demand to rule the roost. 
Against this backdrop of the latest promise by SLFP rebels to form an Interim Government led by Rajapaksa after defeating the Budget 2019, Yahapalana economics have not been able to stem the Rupee fall. PM Wickremesinghe now says it is a global crisis, not just ours. That clears US President Donald Trump and Rajapaksas Chinese loans of any culpability. If Rajapaksa is able to win his gamble of an Interim Government without any backtracking by Sirisena , the blame for the Rupee decline would be left squarely on Yahapalanaya rule for Rajapaksas convenience.
Yet the story of the Rupee would not come to an end on that or any sooner. Since 1978 with the free market economy, the Rupee came crumbling too. In early 1977, the Rupee was 5.95 for a US dollar. After President Jayewardene devalued the Rupee in late 1977,it was 16.00 per US dollar in 1978. During the Premadasa era it was Rs.25.79. During Madam Kumaranatunges two terms as President the Rupee declined further from 34.92 in 1995 November to 44.39 in end 2005. At the closing of the year 2014 when Rajapaksa went to polls, the Rupee was 131.21. In less than four years of Yahapalanaya rule the Rupee has hit a devastating low of 170 for a US dollar. Despite small and short random appreciations twice or thrice during this whole 40-year period, the Rupee has continually depreciated by 284 per cent under every President and every Finance Minister in every government in this heavily liberalized free market economy.
This free market economy also left an ever widening foreign trade deficit all through 40 years. Ushered in when the foreign trade deficit in 1978 was 68.5 million USD, the deficit grew to 721.0 million,12 years later in 1990. When we stepped into the New Millennium, it was 838 million USD. When elections were fought in end 2014 to oust Rajapaksa the deficit was 8,201.66 million and three years of Yahapalana rule, further increased the foreign trade deficit to Rs.9,600 million USD at the end of 2017.
Against a growing foreign trade deficit, the export income could only cover around 50 per cent of the import cost.Though experts speak of an impressive export growth in 2017, the revenue was only 11.4 billion USD, against an import cost of 21 billion.Success of the apparel industry that is said to earn around 40 per cent of foreign trade income is a total lie. All raw material and accessories for apparel manufacture is imported at around 18 per cent of our total import expense (based on data from World Integrated Trade Solution). In 2017, while apparel export income was boasted as 4.82 billion USD, the cost of imported raw materials was around 3.8 billion.This leaves only aone billion USD gain from apparels. Compared to heavy cost the tax payers incur to provide numerous concessions and benefits to these export manufacturers packaged with an uncivilized, unconstitutional leverage to axe trade union rights of workers, a nett gain of one billion in 2017 is actually a loss. The pathetic side of these much fancied export manufacture revenue earned through FDIs, is told by migrant labour.Young women who slave for a paupers wage in the Mid East included, migrant labour remitted 7.1 billion USD the same year,that amounts to over 60 per cent of the total revenue from all goods exported.
The larger majority though used as voters to periodically elect governments are left in the periphery of the urban centred market. Free market also leaves education, health and public transport almost in chaos with governments not taking responsibility
This continuing perversion in a free market for the filthy rich has left an expanding Colombo city packed with sprawling high-rise apartments, shopping malls, restaurants, private hospital complexes, jogging paths, car parks with snail pace vehicular traffic on all roads. Meanwhile, the vehicle import industry has grown into a disturbing but a high-profit trade. We thus had 1.09 million 3wheelers, 3.5 million motorcycles and 6.6 million vehicles on the roads, end 2016. It also means, an adult population of around 15 million has 11 million private vehicles of two, three or four wheels. High speed commercially expanding Colombo with two or three satellite urban centres around, has left 70.4 million rural lives without decent incomes. Micro finance companies have moved ruthlessly to exploit the desperate efforts of these men and women in finding livelihood opportunities. It had left people as beggars with no social right to beg. They have to struggle to surviveand exist.
The larger majority though used as voters to periodically elect governments are left in the periphery of the urban centred market. Free market also leaves education, health and public transport almost in chaos with governments not taking responsibility. With judiciary and law enforcement accepted as inefficient and corrupt,justice and fair play remains a distant dream without big money or political power to lean on. Free market democracy is not for the two million plus workers. Fundamental right to form trade unions and become members guaranteed by the Constitution under 14(1)(d) in Chapter III is consciously and ruthlessly denied to workers on terms and conditions laid down by employers. This now brings the added threat of losing employment to cheap labour brought from India, Bangladesh, Myanmar and China.The type of bonded labour the Britishers brought for the plantations, a Century and a half ago.
Thats what development is in this free market economy. The passed forty years has proved that development through FDIs and export manufacture is a horrible false promise.Free market performance has only been far worse year on year and cannot even provide for half of our needs. It has also proved that all what the people sacrificed in terms of tax revenue, debts incurred and dwindling rupee with violations of fundamental rights have only led to mega corruption all round and mayhem in governance.
Forty years is no short life in a nation. Forty years of plunder and looting in this free market has left a country, no one can honestly say I am proud to be Sri Lankan, unless paid for commercial advertising. This situation demands, and the people must demand at least a basic programme for socio economic and cultural improvement of life that would reach rural society as well. People should demand a new paradigm in development from political leaders, before listening to their stupid promises about change of governments to save the country. People need to demand a development paradigm based on:
1. Implementation of the APRC Final Report in full within 06 months, after making it a public document for social discourse
2. Ensuring Chapter III, Constitution 14(1) is effectively guaranteed in full with trade union rights included in BOI guidelines as mentioned in the Constitution
3. A five-year national socio economic and cultural development programme with due importance for environmental safety and improvement included and also clear identification of areas that FDIs should be sought for, made public for social discourse before parliament approves it for implementation
4. A disaster management plan for districts identified for possible earth slips and floods with environmental safety nets and development/improvement of the national green canopy
5. An educational reforms committee mandated to propose within a year through public consultations, far reaching reforms in all aspects of formal education including higher education
6. Develop a national health policy with greater emphasis on preventive and community health services,giving provincial administration the power to administer and implement
7. Public commuter transport, both rail and road, to be the responsibility of the government and developed as efficient, comfortable and affordable, combined commuter service
8. Complete ban on vehicle import permits and import of vehicles to be strictly regulated for public and State needs
9. The construction of high rise apartments, condominiums and shopping malls to be immediately controlled and regulated with serious and important focus given to neighbourhood social space and common utilities
10. New cess levy (Rs.10 per litre) on all imported fruit and synthetic beverages/cordials/drinks to be channelled to a legally constituted state of the art Agri Research Centre that should develop new post harvest technologies, value adding processes for shelf life, new crops for commercial farming (Wood apple, Beli fruit etc,) within agreed time frames
11. Develop freshwater fish culturing through cottage level farming with a floor price slapped on fingerlings and a cess levied on all imported (though locally canned) fish to be used for promotion of fresh water fish farming
12. Abolish the present annual decentralised budgeting for members of parliament with equal allocations provided to provincial councils with special development projects with proven feasibility
If society does not take the responsibility to hold political parties and their leaders responsible for holistic development on a clear programme agreed upon through peoples participation, the crumbling Rupee may see the yahapalanaya government crumble too. But that would definitely not bring answers to a crumbling economy and a continuously fooled society living in a fools paradise.

## Title: Early symptoms of cancer

Early symptoms of cancer
	

Previously I have explained why early detection of cancer can significantly improve the chances of a complete cure. Today I will discuss early symptoms and signs of some common cancers which we can keep a lookout for.
Depending on the site of cancer these symptoms and signs vary. However significant weight loss over a short period of time, loss of appetite and the generalised weakness of the body can be seen in many cancers before the actual site specific signs appear.

Breast cancer
The commonest sign is a lump felt in the breast. This can be found anywhere in the breast or even in the armpit. Also look out for changes in the nipple like a change of shape, position or a discharge coming from the nipple when squeezed. Breast cancer can also present with changes in the skin overlying the breast. (Redness, dimpling etc). If there is a persistent pain in the breast or the armpit, these can be an early warning signs. Some of these signs could be due to normal breast changes or due to a benign breast condition. The best example are small lumps appearing or enlarging only during menstrual period. This most likely is due to benign breast conditions.

Cervical cancer
This is a cancer originating from the neck of the uterus and is the second commonest cancer in Sri Lankan women. This is usually seen in older women and the commonest symptom is bleeding from the vagina after menopause. In menstruating women there could be bleeding in-between cycles or after intercourse. Pain in the lower stomach or pelvis could be a sign of advanced disease.

Mouth/ Throat cancer
A whitish patch inside the mouth cavity which cannot be rubbed off could be a pre-cancer which if not treated can transform into a full-blown cancer. Other danger signs are non healing ulcers, bleeding from an ulcer or a lump in the mouth. If the cancer is in the throat there can be pain while swallowing or a change in the voice such as hoarseness. If seen in smokers or people who chew betel for a long time they take an added significance as they are more likely to get oral cancers.

Lung cancer
Persistent dry cough is the number one warning sign. This will usually not settle with normal cough treatment. Coughing can also bring out blood stained sputum. Chest pain specially with deep breathing is also a danger sign. Lung cancer can cause fluid to collect in between the ribcage and the lungs. This will prevent the lungs from fully expanding and cause difficulty in breathing.

Oesophageal / Stomach cancer
Oesophagus is the tube that connects the mouth to the stomach. If a cancer occurs here it will obstruct the swallowed food from reaching the stomach. This difficulty in swallowing will be first seen with regard to solid food and then progress to prevent liquids from being swallowed too. Stomach cancer will occur as a tumour or an ulcer in the stomach. Since the tumour takes up space within the cavity of the stomach it will reduce the amount of food you can eat at one go. When you try to eat more it may cause vomiting. Also tumour eroding the lining of the stomach would cause bleeding which can come out with vomiting or pass with stools. When its passed with stools it usually takes a tar black colour.

Colon / Rectal cancer
Commonest sign is change of bowel habits. This can be constipation or diarrhoea. Feeling of need to go again just after passing stools is an important symptom. Passing of blood with stools is also a danger sign. Specially if the blood is mixed with stools as opposed to passing of fresh blood after stools have been passed. Dull persistent tummy or lower back pain also should not be ignored.

Prostate cancer
Prostate is an organ found only in men and which surrounds the bladder neck. The urethra which takes urine from the bladder to the end of the penis runs through this. This condition is always associated with age and the prostate gland enlarges in size. Most of the time this enlargement is due to a non cancerous (Benign) cause. However rarely it could be due to a cancer. This expansion of the prostate gland can cause pressure on the urethra causing obstruction to the free flow of urine. This will result in the urge to pass urine frequently, feeling of inadequate emptying of the bladder, poor urine flow or need to strain to pass urine etc. If blood is passing with urine it is more likely due to a cancer rather than a benign condition.

Leukaemia / Lymphoma
The symptoms are mostly due to cancer cells invading the bone marrow and preventing the development of normal blood components like haemoglobin, white blood cells and platelets. Lack of haemoglobin would cause pale skin, lack of energy and easy fatiguability. Low platelets would present with bleeding from gums, easy bruising. Low white blood cells can impact the body immunity and make you more prone for infections. With Lymphoma there will be enlarged lymphnodes which can be felt easily. They can be only in one part of the body or involve different areas like neck, armpits, groin etc.

Brain tumours
Commonest symptoms are headaches and vomiting. If you wake up with a headache and it is relived after vomiting that is a sinister sign. Weakness or numbness of an area or adult onset fits are symptoms of advanced tumours.
These are few of the signs and symptoms of some of the common cancers in Sri Lanka. Most of these can be seen not only with cancers, but also in normal people and in benign conditions as well. So no one should get unduly worried if these symptoms are present. Whats important to remember is to seek medical advice as soon as possible. Depending on the severity, combination of symptoms, risk factors present, the medical practitioner would decide whether further investigation is needed. Being aware of the early warning signs and symptoms might help you to nip this dreaded disease in the bud.

FCID returns Ford Mustang imported by Namal to owner
	
The controversial Ford Mustang which was reportedly imported by MP Namal Rajapaksa, was today returned to its current owner by the FCID.
The vehicle was under FCID custody for more than two years after it was seized from Kaduwela in 2016.
Counsel Premanath C. Dolawatta who appeared for the owner said the FCID had not arrested a single suspect in connection with the case.
This vehicle was bought by MP Namal Rajapaksa on a permit issued to him in 2010. Later, W.M. Shanthini bought the vehicle for his son Harshana Silva. When the vehicle was being repaired, the FCID seized it and in a futile attempt linked it to Namal, he said.
The counsel thanked the Kaduwela Magistrate for ordering the FCID to return the vehicle to the current owner.
Meanwhile, Harshana Silva said the FCID had questioned all his family members and even friends about the car which he had legally bought. We went through a period of severe mental harassment, he said.

How the US invents enemies to maintain its dominance
	
Enemies are really friends. This oxymoron serves as a secret motto of some countries, particularly the United States. One wonders whether US Vice President Mike Pences broadside last Thursday at China was part of a bid to fast track the process to make an enemy out of China, if it has still not become one. It came against the backdrop of President Donald Trump taking a series of anti-China measures, including a dangerous trade war, and provocative US warship manoeuvres, like what happened last week, when a US warship in the South China Sea veered into what China calls its territorial waters but the US regards as international waters.
In his broad attack, Pence accused China of predatory economic practices, military aggression against the US and of trying to undermine President Trump and harm his chances of winning re-election.
Though he cited what he called US intelligence reports, he offered no solid evidence to back up his claim, except to cite Chinas alleged military designs in countries such as Sri Lanka. He said Beijing was using billions of dollars in infrastructure loans to countries across the world to tie them to the Chinese government and described this practice as debt diplomacy.
The terms of those loans are opaque at best, and the benefits flow overwhelmingly to Beijing, he said and, referring to Sri Lankas Hambantota Port, he added that it was commissioned by Sri Lanka with Chinese funds in 2010, but when Sri Lanka was unable to pay back its loans, a Chinese state-owned company took ownership. It may soon become a forward military base for Chinas growing blue-water navy, Pence warned.
Pences tirade against China raises a question as to why the US wants to make China a hostile nation. It also gives credence to claims that the US needs an enemy to survive. As a matter of fact, it has always had one, two or more enemies at any given time. The US is not alone. The enemy creation is part of statecraft. The behaviour of Israel and, in our neighbourhood, of India and Pakistan, indicates that states gain many advantages by having an enemy. Once the enemy is found or invented, the enemy perception is whipped up in the minds of the populace while the state seeks to achieve its geopolitical goals. There are domestic political advantages, too. At election times, it is not uncommon to see heightening tensions between enemy states, with campaign speeches full of real or imagined threats from the enemy. Because the enemy exists, politicians are able to inflate their egos and project themselves as the only leaders who could give the enemy a fitting reply.
At the macro level, the bogey factor helps rulers to divert the peoples attention from real issues; from the secret deals and immoral wars they wage with ulterior motives. Remember George W. Bushs wars
Communism as an ideology, and the Soviet Union as its evil face, had been the enemy of the US for some 45 years since the end of World War II. The US fought many wars and propped up dictators in Africa, Asia and Latin America in the name of containment or to prevent Communism from gaining ground, or, in other words, to help capitalists plunder the global resources and to make the rich richer and the poor poorer.
With the collapse of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War in 1991, the US wanted a new enemy to continue its domination of the world through military means and cover up its blatant aggressions, subtle regime change campaigns and profiteering through wars. Imagine the US without an enemy. For a short period after the end of the cold war, it was without an enemy. It was the sole superpower and it came under immense pressure from within and outside the country to give leadership to a world order where peace and justice would prevail and international law would be respected. The post-cold war elation became a rallying point for greater democracy and improving human rights. It was during this period that the campaign for the setting up of a world criminal court gained momentum. Sadly, such a world order was not on the US realpolitik agenda.
Then the US invented an enemy. Radical Islamists, Islamic extremists, Islamic terrorists and jihadists, whatever name one calls them, became the enemy, though they were once the United States allies, armed, trained and financed to take on the rival superpower, the Soviet Union, in Afghanistan during the cold war. They were fondly called the Mujahideen, the plural of Mujahid meaning Jihadist. The Americans called them freedom fighters and compared them with those who fought for US independence.
The friends became foes, just as George Orwell explains in his famous dystopian novel 1984. The 9/11 attacks carried out by the enemy led to the undoing of the progress the world was making in strengthening democracy and human rights. The enemy helped the sole superpower to invade Afghanistan and Iraq, and create chaos in Libya, Syria and the rest of the Arab world.
Now that the so-called Islamic terrorist is on the run or, more or less, wiped out, it is time to find a new enemy. China fits the bill. To put it in a more US-friendly way, while Washington was on the hunt for the Islamic terrorist, China emerged, without much noise, as a possible contender for the US.
Alarmed by Chinas assertive diplomacy in the South China Sea and, of late, in the Indian Ocean, the US is now in a hurried attempt to prepare the American people for a bigger and more intensified campaign against China. It need not be military.
Pences Thursdays speech was largely an attempt to take the case against China to the American people. The American people deserve to know he underlined.
According to Thucydides theory, the dominant world power will not give up its number one position without a fight. Are we witnessing a preamble to such a major confrontation The only solace is that nuclear powers do not go to war if they are ruled by rational leaders.
It appears that China is doing in the South China Sea and parts of the Indian Ocean what the US did in the Caribbean and the Pacific in the 19th century. The 1823 Monroe doctrine, named after the then US President James Monroe, was a virtual warning to European powers, especially Britain, that they should not return to the Caribbean to dominate the region through colonialism or through client states. Just as the US in the 19th century ousted Britain, the then superpower, from the Caribbean or from the US neighbourhood, without a fight and while maintaining friendly relations, China is now on a campaign to oust the US from the seas in Chinas neighbourhood, while maintaining friendly relations. Just as the US resorted to the dollar diplomacy and economic hegemony, China is now resorting to Yuan diplomacy and trying to become a world power through its belt-and-road initiative.
The US is not unaware of these moves. The US will not let the fate that befell Britain in the Caribbean befall it in the South China Sea region. That is the reason why the US keeps challenging Chinas sovereignty over islands and coral reefs in the South China Sea. But at present, the conflict is more a battle of wits than military.

I nominated the most senior and experienced SC Judge: MS
	
For the first time in Sri Lanka's judicial history I have nominated the most senior and experienced Supreme Court Judge to the post of Chief Justice, President Maithripala Sirisena said.
He said this at a ceremony held at Ape Gama in Battaramulla where letters of appointment were handed over to Regional Forest Officers and the Productivity Awards of the Mahaweli Development and Environment Department.
The President said in several instances in the past the Heads of State had appointed Chief Justices not on merit but on political, personal or party considerations.
The Supreme Court judges met me soon after I returned from Seychelles early this week and urged me to nominate the most qualified and senior judge of the Supreme Court as the Chief Justice. They said by doing so the career judges would nurse the confidence that they too will stand the chance of being appointed to the post sans undue influence, he said.
He said he did not submit several names to be considered for the post of CJ but only the name of an official who had served the judiciary for 38 years and 11 months having served as a President of a Labour Tribunal and risen from the ranks to Sri Lanka's apex court. (Sandun A Jayasekera)

India will soon find out: Trump warns of sanctions
	

Washington, (Hindustan Times), Oct 11, 2018 - In his first reaction to India signing a multi-billion dollar deal with Russia for the S-400 missile defence system despite the threat of US sanctions, President Donald Trump said on Wednesday that New Delhi would soon find out about Washingtons response. 
Trump said he would announce soon if he will, or will not, exempt Indias purchase from secondary sanctions under a law that seeks primarily to penalize Moscow for annexing Crimea and allegedly interfering in American elections in 2016. 
India is going to find out, arent they Trump said ominously at a news conference in response to a question from reporters about India signing a $ 4.5 billion deal with Russia last week during President Vladimir Putins visit to New Delhi. 
Youll see, the president said in response to another question about the timing of his decision. Sooner than you think. The US president did not, as noted by observers and experts, say he will waive sanctions as has been requested by India. 
The United States had issued a thinly-veiled warning just the day before Putins arrival in New Delhi that S-400s were a focus area of secondary US sanctions against countries  such as India and other buyers of Russian military hardware  that made significant purchases from designated entities in Russias defense and intelligence sectors. 
US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Defence Secretary James Mattis had earlier argued the case for a waiver to India.

Judging whether your life partner will be a foreign national
	
A new dimension to unconventional marriages

Necessity knows no law, they say.We know that in a wider sense that the necessity does not care about age-old customs, traditions and social norms either.
For example, when a young man and a young woman find that there is a strong emotional and spiritual bond between them formed in the course of sharing common interests or in any other circumstances, they would enter into a life-long partnership disregarding the age-old established norms pertaining to marriage.
Despite, all this marriage is still being widely looked on as a sacred institution, the long-established practice of choosing a life partner from the same nationality, race, religion and the caste appears to be dying out slowly but steadily.
However, a large majority of people in our country still seem to believe in the conventional marriage judging by the contents of numerous marriage proposals advertised in the national weekliesthese days.
Parents choosing a life partner
In most of these cases, it is the parents who seek a partner for their son or daughter and they invariably make it a point to mention their ethnicity, religion and caste indicating preference for a bride or a bridegroom from the same community.

Parental initiative takes a back seat
Nevertheless, there is a growing trend among parents to allow leeway for their children to marry a partner of their choice irrespective of ethnic, religious or caste compatibility. Very often, nowadays young men and women meet and fall in love and later seek parental consent to tie the knot. While, the inter-caste and inter-racial marriages are on the increase now, yet another type of unconventional marriage has entered the equation: either a love relationship or marriage witha foreigner.

Foreigners turning bridegrooms
The local- foreigner relationships have begun to increase of late with more and more foreign nationals visiting the country as tourists, investors, and resource personnel on foreign-funded development projects. Another factor contributing to the increase of this type of unconventional marriage is more and more Sri Lankans securing employment in Mid-east and certain developed countries mostly in the West.
Our present purpose is to discuss the Astrological factors that lead to a local marrying a foreigner throwing all conventions to the four winds.

Rahus role in unconventional marriages
Vedic Astrologers credit Rahu, the shadow planet with causing unconventional marriages, those with foreigners in particular.
Rahu, in fact, is believed to be playing an important role connecting a native with everything foreign. Rahu also plays a major role in timing the unconventional marriages. For instance, a marriage with a foreigner would take place either in the major Dasa period of Rahu or in his sub-Dasa period in the major Dasa lord of the 7th House.

Planetary positions signifying an unconventional marriage
Given below are a few planetary positions that lead to marriage with a foreigner.
Rahu associated with the 7th lord in the 12th House indicates marriage with a foreign national.
	Rahu placed in his constellation or that of the 12th lord occupying the 6th or the 12 House in Rasi (D1), Sapthamsa (D7) or Navamsa (D7) charts points to the possibility of marrying a foreigner.
	Venus, Significator of both marriage and marriage partner, if placed with Rahu or in 2/12 positions with Rahu or is aspected by Rahu, signifies marriage with a foreigner.  
	The lord of the 7th house in the 12th House or vice versa points to a marriage with a foreigner and taking up residence abroad.
	The lord of the 12th House posited in the 4th House while being aspected by Venus or the lord of the 7th House signifies marriage with a foreigner and living abroad.
	The lord of the 12th house in the 7th House with the lord of the 4th House indicates marrying a foreigner.
	Rahu occupying either the 12th House or the 6th House in the Rashi, Sapthamsa and Navamsa charts would cause the native to marry a foreigner.
	The 12th lord either from the Moon or the Lagna placed in the asterism (Nakshatra) of Rahu would lead to marryinga foreigner.
	Venus, either posited with or aspected by Rahu in the 2nd or the 12th position to each other in the Navamsa chart indicates marriage with a foreigner.
Rahu also plays a vital role in timing the marriages with foreign nationals. Such marriages would take place during the Maha Dasa or Antar Dasa of Rahu or failing which in the Dasa period of the 7th lord.

8.3 Million Signaturesto The United Nations To End Cosmetic Animal Testing Globally
	
World Animal Day,The Body Shopand Cruelty Free International brought 8.3 million signatures against cosmetic animal testing to the United Nations Headquarters in New York City to create a global framework to end animal testing while advancing the United Nations sustainable development agenda.

The celebration of these signaturesis a culmination of more than 30 years of advocacy between The Body Shop, the first international beauty brand to campaign against animal testing in cosmetics, and its long-time campaign partner Cruelty Free International, the first global, non-profit organization dedicated to ending cosmetic product and ingredient testing on animals. The joint effort is the most ambitious campaign ever against cosmetic animal testing and serves as a model to inspire action from businesses, governments and citizens to advanceSustainable Development Goal 12 (SDG12): Responsible Consumption and Productionand other key responsible production and consumption issues. Lise Kingo, Executive Director of the UN Global Compact, joined The Body Shop at the UN to discuss how businesses can do more to engage and mobilise consumers in support of the SDGs.

The petition signatures, collected from supporters around the world in just 15 months,call on the countries of the UN to formalize an international framework to end cosmetic animal testing, everywhere and forever.


Cosmetic animal testing is cruel,old-fashioned, expensive and inefficient. Today, there are more reliable alternatives. The Body Shop and many other cruelty-free companies use innovative and effective cruelty-free ingredients in all their products, all tested through innovative non-animal methods.

Although there has been sizable progress, including the European Unionprohibiting all cosmetic animal testing in 2013 as well as the sale of products tested elsewhere, 80 percent of countries still have not made it illegal to test cosmetics on animals. Cruelty Free International estimates that more than 500,000 animals each yearare used in cosmetics testing.

A global framework is the only way to eliminate animal suffering and create a level playing field around the world.

Harmonizing safety testing requirements globally would allow companies to avoid unnecessary bureaucracy and test duplication when accessing international markets to fill the consumer demand for safe and humane cosmetics. Not only would a global framework give confidence to companies that they are producing safe and effective cosmetics while meeting consumer demand for truly cruelty-free products, but also, the global framework would align with the United Nations vision of a world in which,humanity lives in harmony with nature and in which wildlife and other species are protected.
In just 15 months more than 8 millionpeople signed their names in recognition that cosmetic animal testing is outdated, cruel and unnecessary, said David Boynton, CEO of The Body Shop. We are determined to finish what Dame Anita Roddick, our founder, started back in 1989, and today we are hosting a special event at the United Nations to call for collaboration among the cosmetic industry, civil society and governments finally to end cosmetic animal testing everywhere.


Together with the activist spirit of our store teams and customers around the world, we have reached more consumers with this campaign than we ever have before. said Jessie Macneil-Brown, Global Head of Activism at The Body Shop. The support of so many people around the world demonstrates that corporate activism can make a positive impact on a global scale.

People are misinformed about cosmetic animal testing, said Michelle Thew, CEO of Cruelty Free International.The Forever Against Animal Testing petition demonstrates that across the globe, people want this cruel practice to end. A global framework is the only way to truly eliminate animal suffering.

This initiative shows the potential for brands to engage and mobilise consumers at scale in support of the SDGs, and how, by combining business innovation, enabling policies and consumer power, real change can be achieved. The SDGs are everybodys business and we look forward to working with The Body Shop to build and share industry knowledge and insights on how to harness consumers and drive collective action in support of more responsible production and consumption patterns, said Lise Kingo, CEO and Executive Director of the UN Global Compact.  


The Body Shop India made definitive progress towards FAAT, advancing the United Nations vision of a world where humanity lives in harmony with nature.The brand has received tremendous response from across the world with maximum signatures from UK, followed by Canada and third from India. Infact India produced maximum support in Asia by garnering maximum number of signatures in Asia towards supporting the cause.Actress, Philanthropist and Brand Ambassador, The Body Shop India,Jacqueline Fernandez, was also present along with the global team and spoke at United Nations, where the signature campaign was submitted. She said, Its been a most fulfilling journey being associated with The Body Shop as the Brand Ambassador for India for the last five years and champion Cruelty free, 100% vegetarian beauty. I personally believe that real beauty cannot be achieved at the cost of harming anyone, especially animals. The concept of animal testing for cosmetics and its ingredients is outdated, cruel and unnecessary and should be banned forever. A socially responsible world cannot continue testing measures that prove hazardous to anyones health. Today, as we stand vindicated, proud that the campaign has touched a chord with so many across the world, inspired & ignited men & women, customers and fans, young & old, believers and cynics; it is time to take this to its logical conclusion. Its time to ban Animal Testing Forever and everywhere.


Consumers can get involved with the campaign by joining the online rally at-

Opportunism is his bane!
	
A Diyawanna politico, who had been playing a double game by keeping one foot in yahapalanaya and other in the Opposition has now been reduced to a nonentity due to being disowned by both sides, they say.

The politico has already been ousted from the electorate organizer post by the political party in power and the chances of his getting an organizer position from the new party which he had been half-heartedly wooing are said to be remote.
Meanwhile, local activists of the new party have already raised strong objections to offer any responsible position in the party to this politico.
The man is not getting even an invitation to any public function either these days. While being cold-shouldered by his onetime leaders and colleagues, his supporters who used to hang around him for years are also said to be deserting him one by one. 
Given this sudden change of fortune for the worse, the man, reportedly, remains confined to home these days contemplating his political future.

Russia is interested in closer ties with SL: Putin
	
Russia, whichmaintains traditionally friendly relations with Sri Lanka,is interested in closer trade and economic cooperation, including in fishery, agriculture and tourism, President Vladimir Putin has said on Thursday. 
He expressed these views at a ceremony held in the Alexander Hall of the Grand Kremlin Palacewhere 23 newambassadors including Sri Lankan Ambassador Dayan Jayatillekapresented credentials to President Putin.
I would like to note that in September, Russia and Sri Lankasigned a bilateral inter-governmental agreement on military cooperation, the President said.
He said diplomacy is needed to play an active and constructive role, to use the power of words, negotiations and compromise to make a tangible contribution to overcoming the current difficulties in international affairs and searching for responses to new challenges and threats.
Russia is dedicated to a peaceful policy and progressively carries out a responsible course in foreign policy. As a permanent member of the Security Council, Russia defends the basic principles stipulated in the UN Charter: sovereignty and equality of states and non-interference in their domestic affairs. We stand against using politically motivated protectionism measures and sidestepping the norms of international law.Russians want to live in peace; they want Russia to be a strong and independent state. We try to do everything necessary to strengthen global stability and to build a system of equal and indivisible security, he said.

Saudi Crown Prince ordered operation targetting  Khashoggi
	

(c) 2018, The Washington Post  Shane Harris Oct 11, 2018 - WASHINGTON - The Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia, Mohammed bin Salman, ordered an operation to lure Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi back to Saudi Arabia from his home in Virginia and then detain him, according to U.S. intelligence intercepts of Saudi officials discussing the plan. 
The intelligence, described by U.S. officials familiar with it, is another piece of evidence implicating the Saudi regime in Khashoggis disappearance last week after he entered the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul. Turkish officials say that a Saudi security team lay in wait for the journalist and killed him. 
Khashoggi was a prominent critic of the Saudi government and Mohammed in particular. Several of Khashoggis friends said that over the past four months, senior Saudi officials close to the crown prince had called Khashoggi to offer him protection, and even a high-level job working for the government, if he returned to his home country. 
Khashoggi, however, was skeptical of the offers. He told one friend that the Saudi government would never make good on its promises not to harm him.

SL rejects US claims, says no Chinese military base at Htota
	
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe has rejected US' claim that China might set up a "forward military base" at Hambantota Port, describing it as "imaginary", the Economic Times reported on Thursday.
Addressing a programme at London's Oxford University on Monday, Mr.Wickremesinghe said some people are seeing "imaginary Chinese Naval bases in Sri Lanka.
The Hambantota Port is a commercial joint venture between our Ports Authority and China Merchants - a company listed in the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. There are no foreign naval bases in Sri Lanka," he emphasised.
His comments came days after US Vice-President Mike Pence alleged China of using "debt diplomacy" to expand its global influence and said that Hambantota "may soon become a forward military base for China's growing blue-water navy"
Mr.Wickremesinghe said Lankan Navy's Southern Command was being relocated in the Hambantota port to control security and the US Defence Department has been briefed on these developments.
He said Sri Lanka was also concluding a commercial agreement that would see the Airport Authority of India (AAI) taking over the control of the Hambantota airport, which was built with high interest commercial loan from China.
The Prime Minister said, "In this atmosphere of suspicion, many countries fear that the South China Sea issues can spill over, leading to future militarisation and military competition in the Indian Ocean."
"This has resulted in a number of stakeholders intensifying their interest and presence in the Indian Ocean by expanding their fleets, upgrading their bases, securing access to foreign ports, and aggressive naval posturing via joint exercises, extended sorties, and live-fire drills.
"The Indian Ocean region requires a common understanding that will ensure peace and stability within the region.There is also a need to work towards building a regional framework for both trade and security  while ensuring that the region remains free, open and inclusive...The interests of the smaller states are best served by advocating for and upholding a rule-based order in the region," he said.

## Title: Some more cuts on the kadda

Some more cuts on the kadda
	
Years ago, when Malinda Seneviratne and Michael Meyler crossed swords over English Our Way, the debate was between Standard English and Sri Lankan English.
My contention then, as now, was that disagreement with one does not necessarily imply agreement with the other, since such dichotomies dont play out in reality.
If the World Englishs project assumes a world of language practices and standards, it makes perfect sense to acquaint oneself with both default and local variants of those standards. For Malinda, this was a first step in facing the ghost of colonialism. For me, the rationale was simpler: intellectuals who spill ink over the non-speaker assume that the Native Other requires their benevolence. It is to break this cycle of dependence that I believe we must get out of the rhetoric of Sri Lankan English.
The truth is that English Our Way failed because it empowered a community of non-speakers to wield English the way they wanted to without making them aware of the base on which it stood. One can say, Screw it, we dont need English as she should be spoke. One can say, Screw it, we can create our own standards! But to break away from tradition, one must be acquainted with that tradition.

The truth is that English Our Way failed because it empowered a community of non-speakers to wield English the way they wanted to without making them aware of the base on which it stood
All these seem peripheral to the debate over English and how it is perceived by the majority in this country, but these issues are vital to our understanding of the debate because, believe it or not, the subject of English education is never as hard as its cut out to be. As far as languages go, English is, if we are to quote Malinda himself here, eminently learnable. And if it is, then that means that all those other issues pointed out above are, for the lack of a better way of putting it, nonentities which have been turned into profound, self-apparent problems by academics and practitioners.
Sure, its not the easiest language to learn but thats because it operates on two layers: written and spoken. Unlike Sinhala, English does not operate on a rift between these two layers, but in post colonial societies like Sri Lanka, the myth of elocution and its poorer cousin Spoken English has been sustained for so long that spoken and written English remain miles apart. That is why students from Grade Six and even before are sent to two kinds of classes, to write and pass exams and to pronounce.

Unlike Sinhala, English does not operate on a rift between these two layers, but in post colonial societies like Sri Lanka, the myth of elocution and its poorer cousin Spoken English has been sustained for so long that spoken and written English remain miles apart

Parents tend to privilege English during their childrens middle school years, since when the O/Levels and A/Levels are around, they get them to concentrate on more important subjects. Needless to say, tuition Sirs and Madams profit from this trend to such an extent that one hardly, if ever, come across English tuition classes at A/Levels or O/Levels (even though English is compulsory for the latter). The free market, in other words, squeezes money out of student while he is in middle school.
Just what is taught during this period, within and outside the classroom, is a matter of debate. As a subject, it falls into that classic self-contradictory dilemma: children are taught too much, and also too little. The way I see it, this reflects the entire countrys attitude towards the language: we want it, but cant have it, and we want to speak it, and are assailed every day by a pop culture that has democratised the standards of that language (rap, hip-hop, the American thriller film), but still cant find the courage to put two words together. Teenagers who sing the latest Ed Sheeran song start trembling when asked to recite a poem or deliver a speech in front of a class. Its as soft as a rose, as flexible as it can get, and yet, as a language, it is also as hard as steel, if not harder: were told that everyone can penetrate it, that through some magical formula called English Our Way we can master it, but in reality, we cannot.
Part of the reason for that, of course, is the dependency culture weve grown used to. At a basic level, we believe that tuition teachers can deliver. That they can and that the more gifted of them can spoon-feed their students well is another story altogether, but even accounting for this, the fact is that parents believe all it takes for their childrens marks to improve is a visit to the tuition master.

There are young people I encounter who want to learn Spoken English for reasons which exist outside their classrooms. Some of them neglected tuition in their middle school years and regret it. Others heard their friends speak it eloquently. Still others feel that they may be seen as goday if they dont pronounce words properly
For a hard subject that requires memorisation, theres no harm in entertaining such an attitude. A language, by contrast, be it English, Sinhala, Tamil, or Swahili, thrives on more than just rote learning. It thrives on a literature, a culture of connoisseurship that enables the student to wade through using every possible means, including the popular culture. (For pop culture, despite its derogatory overtones, can become, in the hands of the astute student, a means of learning: after all even Shakespeare, before he became the subject of academic treatises, belonged to that culture once.)
There are young people I encounter who want to learn Spoken English for reasons which exist outside their classrooms. Some of them neglected tuition in their middle school years and regret it. Others heard their friends speak it eloquently. Still others feel that they may be seen as goday if they dont pronounce words properly. Either way, they see in English one way of climbing the social ladder. They do not want to master it. They do not even want to speak it eloquently. They only want to speak the language, passably. And they want to get their diphthongs correct, even if they dont practice with marbles in their mouth.
No, they are probably not enthusiastic about the Henry Higgins school of Received Pronunciation (who is), but while they are not students of elocution, they do want to get their accents and inflections correct (regardless of whether or not those accents and inflections are posh). However, even with their feelings of inferiority, for them English is no more than a mode of communication. I understand what people say, Ive learnt the grammar the way I can, but to talk back to those people with the same intensity, the same ease and passion, is what I want is the typical response I get from students when I ask them about what they feel they lack.
Its a paradox at one level. These young people do not want to master the language they hanker after. Advertisement after advertisement preach the virtues of Spoken English (for the Sinhala speaking lower middle class) or Elocution (for the English speaking middle class), and these youngsters are aware that they should speak it, but they want to be through with it quickly. Actually, we do want to speak it [actually figures in the dictionary of the Sinhala non-English speaking youth: the most obvious reason for this I can point out is that, as with words like therefore, they feel every sentence has to be prefixed by it, almost as a matter of etiquette], but you know, we want to speak it really fast, one young man told me.
There lies the paradox and the tragedy: when it comes to the kadda, the non-speaker has been forced to acknowledge its importance through reasons that exist outside the classroom. The textbooks and workbooks they use are worthless, so they resort to the next best thing: the Spoken English class, overseen by teachers whose credentials are, if at all, suspect. And yet, when they resort to it, they want to speak it swiftly. So out of the window goes the need to learn the language by its literature. Out of that same window also goes that culture of connoisseurship, through which a language can not only be spoken, but more importantly also mastered.
At the end of the day, this is the problem English Our Way has not resolved. The free market has castrated English (its castrated Sinhala too, but thats another story).
It has divorced language from literature. It has created a class of wannabe speakers out of the non English speakers, separating them from the snooty writers who, as Malinda once put it, talk about English Our Way over a cup of tea at 2.34 pm in some living room in a non-Sri Lankan English that the people of this country are now being told they dont have to learn. It has messed up everything, turning us at the end of the day into a nation of gandabba English speakers, neither here nor there.
In another essay I shall delve into the mannerisms and characteristics of the young non English speaker, as I have come across him/her. For now, however, I will close with a contentious observation: while the snooty speaker dwells on Sri Lankan English as the way forward for the country, the country is being fragmented by an inadequate and unsuitable level of English education, even as intellectuals whove benefited from the elitist structures it has spawned lament those same structures (and that, I should add, in a rather unsatisfactory, hypocritical way). A tragedy You bet!

Sri Lanka-Bangladesh FTA soon: Minister
	
Bangladesh expects to sign a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with Sri Lanka during the tenure of the incumbent government as both countries have already completed looking into the feasibility, Bangladeshi Commerce Minister Tofail Ahmed yesterdaysaid.
According to TheDailyStar, he has disclosed this followinga meeting with Minister Malik Samarawickramain Dhaka.
We agreed to finalise the joint feasibility study that was conducted by both countries with a view to signing the FTA between the two countries, Ahmed said.
After finalising the joint study, we will sign the FTA within the tenure of the current government, he said.
The national election in Bangladesh may take place in late December or early January.
The nature of the agreement will be a little bit different as it will cover not only the duties but also the services sector and investment, Ahmed said.
MinisterSamarawickramahas said the joint feasibility study has been done by thetwo governments and that it would be completed by the end of this October.
Meanwhile, Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters AssociationPesidentSiddiqur Rahman said a joint working committee would be formed engaging garment exporters of both countries to produce value-added apparel items for exports to European markets.
He said the formation of the committee was still at the very initial stage. When it comes to producing some garment items, Bangladesh is still very weak but Sri Lanka is strong, he said.
In those cases, Bangladesh's manufacturers will produce the basic garments and send them to Sri Lankan garment factories for more value addition under the Made in Bangladesh tag, said Rahman.
Moreover, Sri Lanka is in an advantageous position because of its sea ports, which are closer to European markets than Bangladesh's Chittagong port, he said, adding that Bangladesh would also use the Sri Lankan ports to its benefit.
The BGMEA leader said Sri Lanka is at least two weeks ahead in lead time compared to Bangladesh thanks to its geographical location.
A shorter lead time is very important in fast fashion as buyers always want quick shipment of goods, he added.
Rahman said a delegation from the BGMEA would hold a meeting with Sri Lankan government officials and garment traders next month.
Minister Ahmed said four direct flights between Dhaka and Colombo could be introduced by coming April to improve communication between the two countries.
Last fiscal year, Bangladesh exported goods worth $30.02 million to Sri Lanka while importing goods worth $47.80 million.

Start working out now!
	

Overweight and obesity have become two terms of major concern not only due to their effects on ones outer appearance, but the potential they have in giving rise to hundred and one negative consequences which are related to health. This is of course if you dont understand and managed these issues properly. In case you didnt know there is a special day which brings world-renowned experts in obesity together, to share innovation and breakthroughs in science unmatched around the globe and it falls on October 11th, this year. Health Capsule this week decided to speak to Dr. Solith Senanayake, Registrar-Internal Medicine/Lecturer, Department of Pharmacology, University of Sri Jayawardanapura to shed light on these topics. 
The incidence of people affected by being overweight and obese has rapidly increased over years. This is due to various unaccepted practices in food consumption, sedentary lifestyles and attitudes towards maintaining a weight within the healthy range says Dr Senanayake. 
As far as Sri Lanka is concernedsome of the latest research data published recently shows that overweight, obese and centrally obese categories have been identified to be around 25%, 9% and 26%, respectively. 

The tendency to become fat
Obesity is the amount of excess fat in the body or simply the tendency to become fat. There are various methods or tools which have been developed with the aim of assessing fatness of an individuals body. The most commonly used anthropometric tool is Body Mass index (kg/m2) which is a measurement of the height in kg divided by height measured in m2. 
Although this may sometimes have pitfalls as far as the exact accuracy is considered, it is the most widely accepted method used at present by most of the health care professionals,  underscored Dr. Senanayake. 
So, according to the value you get, 
BMI> 25 over weight 
	BMI > 30 obese
	In Asians, these cut off values are quite different as follows. 
	BMI > 23 overweight 
	BMI > 25 obese 
However, BMI can be affected by other factors too. For an example, if you are visiting the gym frequently and doing your work-outs on a regular basis, you will tend to have more lean muscle mass where your BMI could be high, without being overweight or obese. 
In addition to BMI, there are various other ways of assessing your fatness, which include: 
Waist circumference 
	Waist: hip ratio in females which is a better measurement of central abdominal obesity which is more associated with adverse health outcomes. 
	Skin fold thickness- a measurement of subcutaneous fat 
	The main causes for this rapid upsurge of the incidence of obese individuals are known to be the poor dietary and lifestyle habits where genetics can also play a role to a minor extent explained Dr. Senanayake. 
In fact, a sedentary lifestyle lowers ones energy expenditure, thereby resulting in undue weight gain. Adding more to it, an affluent society with energy-sparing devices in the workplace and at home play a crucial role in reducing the amount of calories burned which will in turn enhance the tendency to gain weight. Of all sedentary behaviours, prolonged television (TV) watching appears to be the most predictive of obesity. 
Furthermore, diets rich in partially hydrogenated fats, red or processed meats, refined carbohydrates and sugar are associated with an increase risk of weight gain, whereas the intake of vegetables, whole grains, yogurt, fruits and nuts are highly encouraged to be added to your daily meals, in order to achieve a healthy weight. 
Some diseases like hypothyroidism, Cushings disease may be associated with an increase weight gain, so it is always better to seek medical advice to what lies underneath, giving you unnecessary trouble. Certain drugs like psychoactive drugs, antiepileptic drugs, anti-hyperglycemic agents are also associated with weight gain, but it is not advisable to discontinue those without medical advice. 
Some might consider obesity as a disease of the rich-owing to the fact that rich people are more into spending money on junk food and sticking to sedentary lifestyles thanks to the capabilities of investments, but according to latest research data, obesity also affects the poor as well, due to things like marketing of unhealthy foods-restrictions in access to food and healthy facilities for cooking which determine two simultaneous phenomena that are two sides of the coin. 
According to what WHO has unearthed, poor people are malnourished because they do not have enough to feed themselves and they are obese because they eat poorly. This creates an energy imbalance. The food they can afford is often cheap, industrialised, mass produced and inexpensive. Dr. Senanayake said. 
The impact on health
With obesity comes increasing risks of, 
Cardiovascular disease (mainly heart disease and stroke)-the leading cause of death, globally, killing 17 million people annually. 
	Diabetes (type 2)-a global epidemic which rapidly invaded every inch of the world 
	Musculoskeletal disorders-Osteoarthritis 
	Malignancies like endometrial cancer, breast cancer and colon cancer 
	Part of metabolic syndrome which include abdominal obesity, hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia, and hypertension. Patients with this combination have a higher risk for cardiovascular deaths and development of type 2 diabetes mellitus. 

Double burden of the disease
Most of the low- and middle-income countries like Sri Lanka have now faced much trouble- the double burden of disease due to being overweight and obese. 
In fact, while these countries continue to deal with issues related to infectious diseases and under-nutrition, they are also experiencing a meteoric upsurge in the risk factors involved in non-communicable disease conditions including obesity and overweight, most significantly in the urban setting. 

Dealing with this problem
Lifestyle modifications with a healthy diet and adequate exercise help in addressing this issue. 
Different people try out numerous diet plans or bizarre diet patterns to lose weight. But most of them are really difficult to carry out long-term. The best recommended diet plan would be a low calorie diet with less carbohydrate and more protein and a modest amount of fat with emphasis on the quantities of each component. 
Its always good to get a proper individualised diet plan which you can follow for a longer duration after consultation with a qualified dietician or medical professional. 
Exercise should be a main part to maintain the weight which you loose through your diet. Exercise alone will not reduce weight (misconception- I exercise a lot but I dont lose weight) so it is highly encouraged to balance the calories you take in through diet and the calories you burn through exercise. 
I do all the household work so I dont need to do exercise is another misconception followed by most Sri Lankans. It is important to know that it is recommended to do 150 minutes of moderate intensity  brisk walking, but if you cant stick to that, do as much as you can as any exercise is better than no exercise. 
In addition to that, quit alcohol and smoking as they have been identified as two of the killer-risk factors for people affected by obesity. There are various support systems available in Sri Lanka if you are looking for help to get rid of these addictions,the doctor added.

Place for surgery
People who have not met their weight loss goals (loss of at least 5% of total body weight between three to six months with a comprehensive set of lifestyle interventions) can go for pharmaceutical weight loss agents, but this should be done with careful guidance of a health care professional-after considering the pros and cons. 
Candidates for Bariatric surgery include adults who are morbidly obese, have several underlying comorbidities and who have not reached weight loss goals with diet, exercise or drug therapy concluded Dr Senanayake.

US budget deficit $782 billion -highest since 2012
	

US, (rt.com), 11 Oct, 2018 - The US Treasury is selling $74 billion of debt this week to fund the rising budget deficit stemming from the Trump administrations massive tax cut introduced last December and the countrys massive overall debt.
In late September, the Treasury sold a combined $106 billion of debt amid cooling demand from investors.
With countries like Japan, China, Russia and Turkey buying less and selling more US debt, foreign purchases at Treasury auctions have slowed down. One of the reasons is the trade war between the US and China, which has given a boost to
the dollar.
Last weeks data shows that the US budget deficit soared to an estimated $782 billion in Donald Trumps first full fiscal year as president. This is the largest fiscal deficit for the US since 2012.
Americas debt currently stands at $21.5 trillion, while the Treasury said the US government paid $523 billion in interest in fiscal 2018, the highest on record.

US-Russian space duo escape malfunctioning spacecraft
	
 Screenshot from AP video
Russian spacecraft are the only link for crews to the space station since the US ended its shuttle programme seven years ago.
The International Space Station is manned by three people: Alexander Gerst, the first-ever German commander, US astronaut Serena Aunon-Chancellor and Russian cosmonaut Sergei Prokopyev, who have been aboard since June.

A botched launch of the Russian spaceship Soyuz narrowly avoided becoming the latest fatal space incident on Thursday. Rescue systems managed to save the lives of two crew members and conduct an emergency landing.
The Soyuz-MS-10 spacecraft was meant to deliver Roscosmos Aleksey Ovchinin and NASA astronaut Nick Hague, members of Expedition 57/58, to the International Space Station (ISS). But 119 seconds after take-off from the launch site in Kazakhstan the Soyuz-FG launch vehicle experienced a malfunction and crew rescue protocols were engaged.
NASA, on its livestream, reported that a problem seemed to have occurred with the booster rocket between the first and second stages of separation. Shortly afterwards, NASA said they were making a ballistic descent
US astronaut Nick Hague and Russian cosmonaut Alexei Ovchinin exited the Russian spacecraft in good condition after parachuting down near the Kazakh city of Jezkazgan, the US space agency NASA reported.
Russia said it would suspend manned spaceflights pending an investigation.
There have been some failures of unmanned, cargo flights to the space station in recent years because of problems with the rockets.

Will the road end for Sirisena  - EDITORIAL
	
President Maithripala Sirisena who was loved, voted for and ushered in with much hope for the countrys future now sees the road ahead of him in politics strewn with obstacles.
Some opine that the president is in dire straits given the unstable economy and the ever widening gulf between him and the Premier. There are also reports that the president has said that Wickremesinghe is stifling the efforts he is taking to carry out his work.
Amidst all these issues and uncertainties associated with the Yahapalana regime what really stirred a hornets nest was the story that did the rounds that Sirisena was going to team up with Mahinda Rajapaksa and form a caretaker Government.
Neither Sirisena nor Rajapaksa has denied having had a meeting in this regard, but the latter has used this opportunity to show that he is still the number one choice to lead a party, the country and the people. Rajapaksa has said that he would respond to forming a caretaker Government only if the call is made by Sirisena himself.
But as it is, that whole story about the emerging of an interim administration has boiled down to being someones made up story. But if there is something good about this speculative story it exposed how vulnerable Sirisena is these days. He is running out of support within the Unity Government where the majority UNPers are talking about fielding their own candidate at the 2020 Presidential Elections. There is little hope for Sirisena even if he leans on the remaining SLFPers given that this party finished a poor third at the last LG Polls. Given this scenario the much hyped up story about a caretaker government being formed gives Sirisena time to think and play his cards right. Critics however point out whether he is left with any!
In political terms he has burnt the bridge as far as his relationships with Wickremesinghe and the UNP are concerned. Going down memory lane we saw how Sirisena was non-committal when the Joint Opposition moved a no-confidence motion against the Premier this year. Some say that Sirisena wished to see the ousting of Wickremesinghe because that would have allowed the president to have an SLFPer as the Premier. Can Sirisena now expect favours from Wickremesinghe in the future battles he has to face in the political sphere
We see clearly that Sirisena is craving to be on the hot seat as president. Given that the majority in the Joint Opposition would snub him in the event he asks for support it is said that he is desperate in working out a way to retain power. Right now, as speculation suggests, the only person he can turn to is former President Rajapaksa. A fact that Sirisena must consider very seriously is that he would be in a weak position in the event he decides to approach Rajapaksa for help. On the other hand the party that Rajapaksa guides-Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP)- is on the verge of handing over the party reigns to him formally. This will increase the clout Rajapaksa has in politics.
In this backdrop UNP Leader Wickremensinghe has asked party seniors to talk to SLFP reps and find out their stance at the upcoming Provincial Council Elections. There are also reports of Sirisena chairing an ex-co meeting of the United Peoples Freedom Alliance (UPFA) where a decision was taken to appoint a sub-committee to review the partys relationship with the UNP.
While Wickremesinghe wants the Provincial Council Elections held soon, those at the meeting that the President chaired had disagreed with the electoral system under which the elections would be conducted. Overall it would be more of a disadvantage for the SLFP to go for elections now given that even the UNP is ahead of them and the SLPP enjoys an overwhelming presence in the political set-up.
Sirisenas political saga, it seems, is coming to a sad end, akin to the bank book of a businessman who has crashed!

Youth must make themselves the priority
	

Exams, assignment submissions, work stress and parental conflicts are some of the external challenges experienced during youth and adolescent phases in life. While some may look at it as a matter of being organised, living the life of a youth is much more than these involvements. It is that stage in life where you feel the urge to explore the world, read a good book, take time off to nap and eat as much as you want. But in a changing, competitive world these behaviours have been replaced with formalities. Hence with underlying traits of depression, stress and other issues in adolescence, this years World Mental Health Day focuses on Youth and mental health in a changing world. In view of this significant day, the Mirror Health Capsule spoke to Licensed Clinical Psychologist Chrishara Paranawithana who shed light on a few areas that the youth need to adjust inthe long-run. 

Challenges
If we are to look at the mental health of youth, we also need to look at the societal, psychological, physical and in particular the kind of brain changes that happen during adolescence, Paranavithana said in her opening remarks. The adolescent phase manifests traits such as impulsivity and risk-taking behaviours. Psychologists consider that adolescence is quite a tricky phase in the mental health cycle due to the
following reasons :

Identity crisis : Here you have a tendency to question about so many things about yourself in comparison to the world. This could be about the convictions you have about sexuality, personal identities etc. This is the nature of development.
 
Hormonal changes
Milestones : Facing high school exams and other milestones during this phase brings a lot of stress 
	Dynamics of peers : During this phase the brain is extra-sensitive to how others view you; particularly people of the same age, whether you belong to a particular group, whether youre considered an outlier, whether the superiors such as parents and teachers respect and accept you for who you are. Peer dynamics play an important role in elements pertaining to depression and anxiety during adolescence . One could also feel he or she is at the centre of attraction. Due to changes in physical features one may also be more conscious about the physical appearance and how the world sees you. 
	Neurophysiological changes in the brain : During adolescence the emotional centres of the brain are very sensitive. This is why they feel more of the emotions and become impulsive, but your reasoning centres mature a bit later. Therefore they predominate against the reasoning and thinking process of the brain. 

Improving coping skills
According to the Psychologist, when considering most adolescents who visit her clinics, she feels that it is important to develop and enhance the coping skills in youth. With the changed dynamics of sociocultural factors and with technology taking a front seat in the life of youth, there is de-individuation from connections and relationships and also the sheer lack of time and space for personnel self -reflections , she added. Therefore this will be the habituated pattern in the brain. This means that the youth may also have a tendency to lose out on the intra-personal reflection  your relationship with yourself. On the other hand you lose out on interpersonal relationships as well. So we need to encourage the youth to focus on their inner strengths and deal with situations. This is also a stage where many hormonal changes will take place and one may also develop attractions towards those of the same sex or opposite sex. At a stage like this if the youth come across various stresses, they should know their strengths as well as weaknesses. They should have an idea about their own coping mechanisms and they should also have an idea about any maladaptive coping mechanisms. We commonly find things like addiction which could be anything from addiction to technology, substance abuse, food or even pornography. Different neurodevelopmental models indicate why youth are prone to experimenting with drugs and other risk - taking behaviours. Research reflects a developmental imbalance between top-down cognitive control (mental control) systems and bottom-up incentive-reward systems. The capacity to resist temptation and urge in favour of long-term goal -directed behaviour is one major form of cognitive control. Being reflective about your own patterns is important at this stage. In addition to that, the caregivers or parents should also understand the limitations as well as the emotional dynamics the youth are experiencing. This is where self-awareness begins and you start to divert the track towards positive health behaviour change,she added.

Exams vs. deadlines
In terms of exams and deadlines, there seems to be a lack of organization. But we need to look at disciplining and training our brain to be more organised, the psychologist added. When it comes to exams and facing practical situations I see that people are not organized. People need to look at new pathways to identify their patterns and then adopt a positive routine. There is also a challenge that you get from your brain. In the brain you get the basal ganglia which is involved in procedural conditioning initially observing your patterns, consistencies, how you respond to the world, your habits etc. After some time the brain takes over and this gets habituated and conditioned. If you have a habit of doing things at the last minute or doing things in an impulsive way, getting ready one or two days before exams, you will continue this pattern. What happens is after some time your brain takes over and these behaviours become automatised as the brain creates pathways. Once you reach this stage it is difficult and challenging to break the cycle. Thus, it is important to be self-reflective and understand your own patterns. Then you need to check on the areas you need to change. Here you need to start a routine change to bring about a positive behavioural pattern where you continue doing it every day at least for one or two months.

Are you socially depressed
Global research suggests that high levels of online activity on social media could be that a person maybe going through social depression or trying to gain acceptance. Therefore the youth needs to know whether they are utilising social media to inflate their self-concept and if so why Is it related to esteem or is it because your friends havent accepted you into their circle In turn you need to be compassionate about your own self to identify these patterns. Maybe its a fear of being ashamed, abundant or it could be a belief to the effect that you are useless. 


The message is to focus on enhancing your inner-dynamics for well-being and training yourself to be happy within your own skin . Because the true feeling of happiness, contentment, joy, and the ability to be at ease with yourself comes from within. 
Ego says, Once everything falls into place, Ill feel peace; Spirit says, Find your peace, Then everything will fall into place.
