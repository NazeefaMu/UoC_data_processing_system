A typical case of self before service
	

The former strongman had been invited to an Arangetram  a debut performance of classical Indian dance and music  to be presented by a daughter of a leading businessman in Kurunegala. Incidentally, the girl is a niece of the former head of the local body in the area as well.

The event was to be held in a convention hall belonging to the Provincial Council and they had no difficulty in booking the hall with an advance payment thanks to their connection to the former local body head. The PC authorities did not know at the time of booking the hall who was to be the chief guest at the ceremony.
The PC chief learnt that the chief guest was to be the former strongman only two or three days ahead of the event. And he went into jitters.
He immediately ordered the booking of the PC-owned hall be cancelled. The businessman and his family members were stunned when they heard about the PC chiefs order for that left them high and dry. The former strongman had accepted the invitation to be the chief guest and the Deputy High Commissioner had agreed not only to attend as the special guest but also to deliver a special talk at the event. And it was too late to change the venue given the pre-publicity given to the event or to book another venue either.
The local body head who heard about the PC chiefs order was furious. He met the PC chief and berated him about the injustice done to his niece. A subdued PC chief told him: Malli, if our former Lokka attends this event he is sure to attack me during his speech. Thats why I ordered the cancellation of the booking. He added: Now that I know you are personally interested in this matter, Ill call off the cancellationBut, Malli, please tell Lokka not to say anything against me when he addresses the gathering.

Attack on envoy;conspiracy to dilute SLFP anniversary: JHU
	
The Jathika Hela Urumaya (JHU) yesterday alleged that the assault on Sri Lankas High Commissioner Ibrahim Ansar at Kuala Lumpur on Sunday could be a conspiracy to divert public attention from the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) 65th anniversary celebrations.
JHU National Organiser Nishantha Sri Warnasinghe told the media that the envoy was attacked while walking to the airport unaccompanied by any of his personal security officers.
The High Commissioner is provided with security officers who should have accompanied him especially because of the tense situation during the visit of former president Mahinda Rajapaksa to Malaysia on Thursday. It is surprising as to why he was roaming around at the airport premises all alone, he said.
Mr. Warnasinghe said attention was diverted to the assault on the High Commissioner from the SLFP's 65th anniversary on Sunday.
That is why we are describing it as a possible conspiracy, he said and added that the JHU condemned the assault on Mr. Ansar and the protests against Mr. Rajapaksa.
Mr. Warnasinghe said Malaysia's image would not be tarnished by this incident which has been interpreted differently by different people.
We must not forget that during the war, Malaysia helped Sri Lanka in several ways, he said and added that the JHU would mark its 13th anniversary on September 24 at the Sugathadasa Stadium under the theme Sawoma Dinana Maha Ratak.
Mr. Warnasinghe said the JHU had intervened at crucial moments even though the SLFP and the UNP were much older than the JHU. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)

Bitter experience of those appointed to run sweet product venture
	

The political authorities have appointed three kinsmen, one each of three purohitas to the directorate of a state-owned undertaking turning out a sweet product essential for every household.

One of these three directors is the brother- in- law of a purohita linked to plantations. Another director is a sibling of a purohita with ties to public administration. The third one is an uncle of a purohita from Uva handling telecommunications.
However, all vital decisions relating to the running of this undertaking are being taken by a high political authority and the directors are expected to rubber-stamp their approval.
The political authority directly handles even the activity like buying and selling.
And finally the director board has revolted against the usurpation of their powers by the political authority. In fact, the director board had not met for the last eight months. The political authority presiding over the subject had asked the directors to quit if they were not happy with their job. However, they had said that they were not prepared to go home just to please anyone.
The unhappy directors are now set to make representations to the Big Boss and the Second in Command about the dubious dealings being carried out by the political authority over their heads, they say.

It further expanded its reach through popular social media networks such as LinkedIn, Twitter and YouTube acknowledging the digital shift within the community, especially among generation Y and beyond.
Now with the understanding of different approaches each platform perform, the bank carries exciting promotional campaigns, shares information on new products, latest financial news and informative videos through these. Certain advertising campaigns were launched initially on the BOC Facebook and before being they were extended to traditional media. 
Along with the banks SmartGen launch on Facebook, it started the very first Facebook interactive promotion, which gave away electronic devices such as pen drives, headsets and power banks to winners. Thereafter, BOC carried another exciting promotion in line with the International Womens Day, where the winners were selected from the Facebook campaign and gave away gifts from Stone and String exclusive collection and 50 other consolation prices. Keeping the momentum, whilst updating the latest information about the banks novel products and value-added services, BOC carried Sinhala and Tamil New Year games and then added a Movie Marathon to spur the interest among movie enthusiasts - especially generation Y.
In Sri Lanka, it is noted that Facebook is the most popularly used social media network among all other such networks. Similarly, BOCs Facebook page is the most interactive social media tool that the bank uses to communicate with its customers on the social media platform. BOCs LinkedIn and Twitter accounts share financial information that is mostly related to professionals who seek to update themselves with financial trends.
With a view to sharing the experience of digital transformation with the public/community, it launched the countrys very first augmented reality advertisement through press in the month of January this year. The banks digital transformation process has now reached its phase of branch transformation where many branches would have digitally-enabled self-serving SmartZones, which include cash deposit machines, ATMs and an online banking facility that are operative 24 x 7.

Cuddly bears show how to close lifes gaps
	
AIAs regional presence in various towns across the island has become much looked forward to events for both children and adults, especially those who are young at heart. The most recent activations were held in two major towns  Kandy, the picturesque hill capital and Galle, the bustling administrative capital of the Southern Province. Residents in both the high-profile cities were able to have an enjoyable day out.
The most important lesson they learnt amidst fun and games was a great eye opener as to whether they were adequately prepared to face lifes ups and downs  be it planning for retirement, the rising cost of education and health services or most importantly, the unforeseen loss of a breadwinner for the dependants. Many visitors to AIAs activity realised there was a yawning gap between what they will most likely have and the amount they will actually need. 
How they discovered the need to plan ahead wisely and carefully was through a range of exciting activities that included giant cuddly bears, Micky Mouse Jim Pappa and other popular characters. The kids were presented with balloons while their parents had a go at the Future Teller machine that calculated how much they would need when they retire to continue to live comfortably. There were interesting workshops for adults on healthy living and for children sitting for the scholarship exams as well as cricket-centred activations for youths.
AIA Head of Marketing Suren Perera commented, Our AIA in Town series of activations have proved to be real value additions to peoples lives. Were delighted by the response we have had from the residents of Kandy and Galle who have participated with great enthusiasm and appreciated our effort to help them understand the importance of preparing to face the future, especially with regard to the education of their children.

Govt. agreed with foreign company to outsource tax collection: JVP
	
Government has already signed an agreement with Hong Kong McKenzie Company Ltd. to outsource tax collection, Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) MP Vijitha Herath charged yesterday.
MP Herath told Parliament that the fees to be paid to the Hong Kong McKenzie Company for its services have already been agreed upon.
The government has not learned a lesson from the privatisation of estate companies and had gone to privatise tax collection" he said while highlighting that privatisation of estate companies had resulted in a delay in signing collective agreements with the unions.
"It's been almost two years since signing of the collective agreements" Mr. Herath said while pointing out that such collective agreements are usually signed once in two years.
Meanwhile, the MP said some private sector organisations have used loopholes to avoid the payment of Rs.2,500 salary increment given to private sector workers.
Government failed to bring in a strict law to force the private sector to give the salary increment" he said. (Yohan Perera and Kelum Bandara)

Govt. says UN Chief didnt referred to a massacre in SL
	
As the Joint Opposition condemned the statement that had been made by UN Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon that he has said there had been a massacre in Sri Lanka, the government argued that Mr. Ban had not made such a statement.
The argument came up in Parliament yesterday when the Joint Opposition moved an adjournment motion to condemn the statement issued by the UN Chief at the end of his Sri Lankan visit.
Joint Opposition MP Dinesh Gunawardane who moved the motion said the UN Chief had wrongly stated that there has been a massacre in Sri Lanka like the ones that had taken place in countries such as Rwanda and Srebrenica.
There is a wrong impression that there has been an ethnic massacre in Sri Lanka" the MP said while highlighting that such a thing never took place in Sri Lanka.
The efforts of the UN and the international community to intervene in Sri Lanka and the government's attitude towards such a move had resulted in Sri Lanka being pushed to a dangerous situation" he said.
MP Keheliya Rambukwella who stressed on the sentiments expressed by the UN chief at the seminar he addressed said the latter had clearly compared the situation in Rwanda and Srebrenica with the Sri Lankan situation. A massacre did take place in Rwanda and Srebrenica but not in Sri Lanka" Mr. Rambukwella said.
Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe who responded said UN Chief never compared the situation in Rwanda with Sri Lanka. He said what Mr. Ki-moon said was that a worse situation occurred in Rwanda.
I was at the event where Mr. Ki-moon made his speech and he never made a comparison. None of the Joint Opposition MPs who make allegations was present at that seminar, the Minister said.
Besides, he said the official statement issued by UN after its visit chiefs visit to Sri Lanka had referred to Rwanda or Srebrenica. Mr. Samarasinghe assured that no foreign judges will be included in any of the probing mechanisms as long as President Maithripala Sirisena remains in office.
Acting Minister of Foreign Affairs Dr. Harsha De Silva also made similar sentiments. We cannot help if the opposition MPs who make allegations cannot understand what Mr. Ki-moon had meant and its not our problem, he said. He said one must note the positive things which Mr. Ki-moon had spoken of during his visits. (Yohan Perera and Kelum Bandara)

A prominent purohita in yahapalanaya holding a high post in his political party as well participated in a media program in Battaramulla area the other day.

The media program over, the purohita was hosted to tea. Meanwhile, several Betel leaf party TU activists of the place took advantage of the VIPs presence to discuss some institutional problems. During the discussion, the purohita observed that the Betel leaf TU leaders at the institution did not appear to be active. He also wondered whether the party unionists here were followers of the former strongman. The TU leaders readily agreed that most of them remained loyal to the former strongman. They boldly added: We too are his supporters!
Affronted by the cheek of the TU leaders, the purohita harangued them and warned that they were no longer welcome at that media institution.
The TU activists did not seem to have taken the purohitas warning seriously. We took the decision to back the former Lokka knowing well the risk we were taking, they said easily.

LG polls likely to be held in Feb.'17
	
The much anticipated local government polls will be held in February next year provided the delimitation committee submits its final report to the Local Government and Provincial Councils Ministry at least by October, Subject Minister Faizer Mustapha said today.
He told a media conference he had given a two-month extension to the five-member delimitation committee chaired by retired senior public servant Asoka Peiris to complete the work.
Elections Commission Chief Mahinda Deshapriya is reported to have said he needs a minimum 65 days to make arrangements for the LG polls from the date it's declared. I hope the report will be submitted before end October so that the elections can be held in February, the minister said.
"All political parties including the UNP, SLFP and the JVP agree that the LG polls should be held under the new electoral system for which the delimitation process has to be completed," he said.
Under the electoral reforms the 335 LG bodies in the nine provinces will elect 482 members from two-member wards and another 27 from three-member wards from the nine provinces.
The number of elected members for local government bodies will thus be increased by 585 from current 4,486 representing 335 local government bodies.
The minister said he wanted a level playing field for all political parties contenting the elections and it was for this reason that he was keen to have an error-free delimitation.
Other members of the committee are S.M. Misbah (UNP) Saliya Mathew (UPFA) Upul Kumarapperuma (JVP) and P. Balasubramaniam (TNA). (Sandun A Jayasekera)

A delegation from a medical association comprising a group of doctors who had imported vehicles using the duty-free permit concession called on the Big Boss recently.

They pointed out that the import tax that was effective at the time they placed their orders for the vehicles had sharply gone up by the time the vehicles arrived and appealed for some measure of relief.
The Big Boss conceded that it was unfair to subject the doctors to this increased tax and he gave them a hand-written memo addressed to the political authority in charge of the subject asking that justice be done to this group of doctors.
The doctors happily departed after profusely thanking the Big Boss and made a beeline to the office of the political authority concerned.
They handed the memo to the political authority sure of a positive response. But they were shocked to hear his response. Who can read this note he demanded. Only a wise guy from  (the name of a village proverbially associated with stupid peasants) may decipher this writing!

The incident happened in the fifth over of Australias innings when Senanayake, after dismissing David Warner, made remarks which could have provoked a reaction from the Australia captain.
After the match, Senanayake admitted the offence and accepted the sanction proposed by Javagal Srinath of the Emirates Elite Panel of ICC Match Referees. As such, there was no need for a formal hearing.

SL Tamils not linked, says JVP
	
JVP leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake, who condemned the assault on Sri Lankan High Commissioner in Malaysia, said in Parliament that there was no nexus between offenders and the Sri Lankan Tamils in the north, and it should be understood.
Associating himself with the remarks by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe that the activists responsible for the assault were not Sri Lankans, Mr. Dissanayake said Tamil people in the north of Sri Lanka declined to heed extremism at the last Presidential Election.
The JVP leader, who is also the Chief Opposition Whip, said extremist forces asked Tamils in the north to boycott the election, but they defied it. He said those extremists outside the country exploited the issues of Tamil people in Sri Lanka for their political ends.
He said this incident could not be linked to the north.
"Northern Tamils are not a party to this incident. So, they should not be linked with it at any cost," he said. (Kelum Bandara and Yohan Perera)

We too deserve to serve as doctors: SAITM graduates
	
Students Union of the first batch to graduate from the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM) said today they too deserve to serve as doctors in Sri Lanka and underscored their competency as being on par with those from State medical faculties.
At a media conference the union representatives rejected media reports and allegations debasing their medical degree.
They said it was disappointing that the Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) and other groups continued to make baseless allegations against SAITM without having a proper understanding of the real situation.
The union said the Government had failed to provide an opportunity to a majority of those who had passed the GCE A/L exam to study for the medical degree. It emphasized the need for government support for SAITM and other private sector medical college.
Piranaby Varathan, a 3rd year SAITM student said they were hurt by claims made by outsiders about their university and their education, because they work so hard to realize their dream to become doctors as much as students who study at state universities.
We are happy and proud to say studied at SAITM, the only place to provide us opportunity to serve our motherland as doctors. If not for SAITM we would have gone aboard for medical studies. We want to serve our country and our people. Those who point fingers at SAITM do not do not care about the real situation. It hurts us because we know how difficult for our parents to send us here, he said.
Tharindu Ruwan pathiranage a SAITM graduate said they were not stupid to jeopardise their education and their lives by joining SAITM.
To a question asked by a journalist he said as far as they were concerned SAITM had not received any news of the Government nationalising the institution. (Piyumi Fonseka )

Informed sources say that the Green leader had taken this complaint seriously and he would report the provincial chief to the authorities in the highest echelons shortly.
