2,500 deaths due to accidents this year
	
More than 2,500 people have been killed in 2,360 road accidents during the first 11 months of this year, according to the National Council for Road Safety (NCRS).
NCRS Chairman Dr. Sisira Kodagoda said of the 2,538 deaths due to road accidents during the period, 760 had been killed in accidents involving motorbikes while 726 had been pedestrians.
He said vehicular traffic had to be streamlined in all roads in the country since the number of accidents and fatalities were rising every year.
Pointing out that the highest number of accidents had taken place on the 3.4 kilometre stretch between Maliban Junction in Ratmalana and Kawdana junction in Dehiwala, Dr. Kodagoda said a special programme to increase awareness of motorists on accident prone areas would be implemented soon.

Jaffna fishermen demand compensation package
	
Fishermen from Jaffna have demanded that the Sri Lankan government frame a comprehensive scheme to safeguard their interests when they experience huge losses caused by poachers.
The need for such a scheme has been felt in the light of a recent incident near Neduntheevu or Deft Island in the Jaffna district wherein 27 out of 30 nets belonging to a Karainagar-based fisherman were said to have been damaged by trawlers run by unknown persons.
On the same day, the Sri Lankan authorities had apprehended four fishermen, hailing from India, along with a trawler, for allegedly poaching in Sri Lankan waters.
The fisherman concerned, Loganathan, claims that even his three other nets are of no use as they too have suffered irreparable damages. In monetary terms, his loss comes to about SLR 2.5 lakh. ?I do not know how I will be able to mobilise this much money and get back to regular fishing,? says Mr. Loganathan.
Replying in the negative to a query whether the government has got any scheme to compensate fishermen who are affected by acts of poachers, M.C. L. Fernando, Director General of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources, says fishermen can join insurance schemes. ?This is only optional. My department has been encouraging them to take insurance policies.?
But, Mr Rajachandran says fishing nets are left out of the ambit of insurance schemes, which cover boats while Mr. Kannah points out says there are genuine difficulties in providing the cover to nets. (The Hindu)

Prices soar in Kataragama
	
An increased demand for accommodation, meals and other items in the Kataragama area following an unexpected influx of devotees during the long holidays has created a scarcity of these needs, with unscrupulous businessmen exploiting the situation charging arbitrary prices.
Most devotees complained that the expenses were unbearable having to pay about Rs.3,000 for accommodation at a makeshift cadjan thatched place with just a single bulb. Hotel rooms that generally cost Rs. 4,000 had shot up to Rs12, 000. Most houses and verandas of small shops were filled with pilgrims, they said.
Hoppers are sold at Rs.40 and Plain tea at Rs 50 in many eateries and hotels while rice with dried fish were sold at Rs.250 in many places.
They also said they had to pay Rs 180 for curd containers filled with about one inch of milk.
Some racketeers had even reserved rooms in advance for 4,000 and rented them out at higher rates making two to three-fold profits.
Meanwhile many devotees seemed to have arrived in their new vehicles to Kataragama in order to offer the poojas dedicated to God Kataragama.
Pilgrims also said there were brokers to reserve places in the queue for the pooja at the Devalaya to those who could afford to pay Rs.1, 000. (Krishan Jeewaka Jayaruk)
