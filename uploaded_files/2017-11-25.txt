Air-dropped packets of tea: Panic in Pannipitiya
	
The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) has said it will investigate an incident where a private company had using a helicopter air-dropped packets of tea in Pannipitiya yesterday resulting in the frightened residents complaining to the CAA.
?The company was only permitted to distribute leaflets and not any objects by the air. They had clearly committed an offence. There was the possibility people being hurt,? CAA Director General and CEO H.M.C. Nimalsiri said.
Meanwhile, the National Movement for Consumer Right?s Protection (NMCRP) yesterday complained to the CAA in writing with regard to this incident where a company had carried out a sales promotion campaign risking the lives of people.
NMCRP Chairman Ranjith Vithanage said the company had airdropped its products using a helicopter in Pannipitiya though the CAA had only permitted this company to distribute leaflets. It is illegal to distribute food items in such a manner. It can cause harm to the people and the environment. (Thilanka Kanakarathna and Kalathma Jayawardhane)

China fully endorses India-SL relations: Marapana
	
Minister Marapana told Daily Mirror that China fully endorsed the various joint ventures Sri Lanka has launched with India, in particular those with strategic importance such as the Mattala Airport Development Project and the Trincomalee Oil Tank Project.
Speaking to Daily Mirror on the outcome of his recent official visit to the Peoples Republic of China (PRC) Minister Marapana said it was sad and indecent that certain political elements were trying to misinterpret Sri Lanka?s warm and friendly links with China and India.
?Their modus-operandi is to create a rift between Sri Lanka and two friendly countries by making unfounded and misleading allegations. I explained in detail to the Chinese side the extremely warm and close cultural, religious and trade contacts Sri Lanka has with both countries and the importance of improving this friendship for the mutual benefits of all, sentiments that China fully endorsed," Minister Marapana stressed.

Discussions with Indian leaders successful: PM
	
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe yesterday said he had a successful round of discussions with Indian leaders on the development projects planned for Sri Lanka with the India's assistance and on the proposed Economic Technical Cooperation Agreement (ETCA) during his visit to the subcontinent.
Mr Wickremesinghe told journalists here before his departure back home that progress had been made on the proposed Economic Technical Cooperation Agreement (ETCA) that is to be signed with India. " I had extensive talks with the Indian Prime Minister and our discussions concluded positively," he said.
The Prime Minister said discussions were also held on the agreement signed between India and Sri Lanka in April this year in which both countries have decided to implement several development projects in Sri Lanka. " Our discussions focused on the delay in implementing some of these projects and certain clarifications on others. Japan will play a part in two of these development projects together with India," he added.
" I met Indian President Ram Nath Kovind, Minister of Foreign Affairs Sushma Swaraj and Indian Congress Party Leader Sonia Gandhi and each of these discussions generally focused on Indo-Lanka ties," he added.
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe returned to the island yesterday (24). He was accompanied by Professor Maithree Wickremesinghe, Prime Minister's Secretary Saman Ekanayake, Additional Secretary Saman Attaudahetti, Minister of Law and Order Sagala Ratnayake and the Prime Minister's special aide Sandra Perera.

EC says polls possible for unaffected local bodies
	
The Elections Commission Chairman Mahinda Desapriya told a JVP delegation yesterday he would inform Court on December 4 that there was no impediment in conducting elections to the local bodies unaffected by delimitation.
A petition has been filed in the Court of Appeal against the implementation of the gazette notification citing irregularities in the delimitation process resulting in the Court issuing a stay order till December 4. This raised doubts about the possibility of conducting the elections in January as earlier hoped planned.
Mr. Desapriya told the JVP that though the final calculation had not been made, nearly 64 out of the total 340 appeared to be affected by the delimitation process.
The Commission will meet today to discuss this matter.
The JVP delegation requested the Elections Commissioner to take steps to hold the elections as early as possible.
JVP General Secretary Tilvin Silva, who attended the meeting, confirmed that the Chairman was of the view that the polls could be held in the unaffected local bodies.
He said his party was not in favour of staggered elections and would prevail upon those who moved court against the gazette notification, to withdraw their cases enabling the elections to be conducted to all the local authorities on a single day.
Meanwhile, Mr. Silva yesterday said after the meeting that the attempts made by the SLFP to postpone the elections would come to naught if the elections were held to these 100 bodies.
"It is against democracy to postpone elections. Those connected to the SLFP went to court to postpone the elections because of a division within the SLFP and wanted to more time till their issues were resolved," he said
Mr. Silva said this conspiracy was carried out by the SLFP with the knowledge of Provincial Councils Minister Faizer Mustapha.
He said the JVP would endeavour to get the elections held in all LG bodies on a single day.
"We will get this issue settled on the road, if we fail to get the election held through the Court. We have organised a series of protest campaigns," Mr. Silva said and added that the petition to suspend elections should be withdrawn before December 4 allowing the elections to be held without delay.

Empowering people by  living the Buddha?s teachings
	
?
It is not necessary to explain, especially for followers of Buddhism, the reality behind joy and sorrow as it had already been preached by Lord Buddha. Buddhism maintains a significant position when analysing the past, present and future of mankind. Buddhism explains in and out of every element of life ? for everyone including followers of other faiths. This beautiful philosophy compels manipulating the use of intelligence and wisdom. It empowers its followers and enlightens them on the fact that anyone can conquer the world, either be it the clergy or laymen.?
Nepal is very close to the hearts of Buddhists because Lumbini, a pilgrimage site in the Rupandehi District of Nepal, is considered the homeland of Lord Buddha. I feel it is important to mention to Sri Lankans about Ven. Maithri Thera who visited Lumbini to help those affected by abject poverty.?
In 1976, the prelate was awarded the higher ordination in Kalutara Seema Malakaya. He was in charge of the Hindi section of Nepal?s programme in the Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation during 1977-1979. A degree holder of the Kelaniya? University, Ven. Maithri Thera has served in the Hindi section from its inception.?
?
Ven. Maithri Thera didn?t give up. He toiled day and night to address these alarming problems. Once, he was a victim of a terrorist attack in Nepal. The writer was taken aback when he heard the attempts made by the Ven. Thera to save his life
?
When Ven. Maithri Thera left for his motherland Nepal on the instructions of his superior Ven. Amithananda Thera in 1980, he launched a programme to guide Buddhists and to ease the various difficulties faced by monks. The Ven. Thera has handed over 400 children to the Buddha Sasana within a period of 10 years. The priest has also extended his invaluable services to Nepal TV and the broadcasting of ?Kathmandu.? Furthermore, the Ven. Thera had initiated the Training School for Bhikkhus upon his arrival in Nepal.?
The priest was compelled to shoulder a greater burden following the demise of Ven. Amithananda Thera. He went to Lumbini from Kathmandu and observed a completely different situation. He saw people suffering from various illnesses. He was entrusted to look after Lumbini ?? however it happened only for a brief three months as communal tensions broke out in the sacred area. The situation was so bad that people started pelting stones at the official residences of monks.
Nevertheless, Ven. Maithri Thera didn?t give up. He toiled day and night to address these alarming problems. Once, he was a victim of a terrorist attack in Nepal. The writer was taken aback when he heard the attempts made by the Ven. Thera to save his life.?
During the height of the problem, the late President R. Premadasa visited Nepal and established the pilgrims rest with funds from the Sri Lankan Government. He held the management of this for some time and later gave up for reasons hitherto unknown. An award has been presented to President Premadasa in Kathmandu, the Capital of Nepal, under the patronage of Ven. Maithri Thera.?
After studying the changes taking place in Lumbini, he spoke about the requirements of the people. He sought assistance from international bodies and empowered people?s representatives.??
Like a smile amidst tears, he mentioned the incident in which the child of a doctor tasted death following a snake bite. We understood in his speech that he put in effort to help the victims of natural catastrophes. He also provided clean drinking water to villages and made arrangements to install tube wells for schools and hospitals. He has been engaged in social work in more than 69 villages in Nepal. He is today the Chief Sangha Nayake.?
The Buddhist Shrine Room built by the Ven. Thera in Lumbini is of pivotal significance for Buddhists. The Katina Ceremony that was held last month displayed cultural features of Buddhists. I always feel that the Ven. Thera is not a Nepalese but a Sri Lankan because he conversed with us in Sinhala.?

JVP should apologize to people: NFF
	
The Janatha Vimukthi Peramu<U+1E47>a (JVP) should apologize to the people for extending their support in bringing the incumbent government into power and casting their vote in favour of the Local Government (LG) Elections Amendment Bill, National Freedom Front (NFF) deputy leader and MP, Jayantha Samaraweera said yesterday.
He said the JVP, having known the repercussions of bringing a UNP government into power, gave its fullest support to the UNP to form a unity government in 2015 resulting in chaos in the country.
?The other reason why the JVP should apologize to the people is for having cast their vote in favour of the LG Elections (Amendment) Bill to secure a two-thirds majority of the government. This has further delayed the PC elections and violated the franchise of the people,? Mr. Samaraweera said.
He said the rumours that were being spread after the resignation of former general secretary Priyanjan Vitharana were absolutely false and added that he had resigned because of ill health. (Sheain Fernandopulle)

Musthapa blames MR Govt for LG polls delay
	
Local Government and Provincial Councils Minister Faizer Musthapha said the joint opposition and the JVP submit no-confidence motions against the previous government and the former subject minister and not against him.
He said the entire controversy surrounding the conduct of the local government polls and all this delay was caused by them.
The minister told Daily Mirror the two parties must first realize who was responsible for the delay and as to who attempted to use the delimitation process to their advantage by hoodwinking the political parties, the voters and the officials.
?The opposition has made me a scapegoat even after I had used my powers to expedite the delimitation process and fast track the conduct of local government polls. Party leaders, including the opposition and the JVP did not protest when I appointed the five-member all party official committee chaired by Asoka Peiris to rectify the shortcoming in the delimitation report released in August 2015. All political parties supported the LG amendments when I presented them in Parliament. Therefore, I don?t understand why they want to submit a no-confidence motion against me after the Court of Appeal stayed the gazette notification on a petition filed by a few,? the minister said. "The delimitation committee report was submitted on June 19, 2015. However, we received more than 1,000 complaints that the delimitation process was flawed. As a government member I appointed a committee to demarcate wards as permitted by law. An all-party conference was also held recently with the participation of the President and the Prime Minister with regard to this matter. The Law is such that the delimitation process is not completed until the appeals are concluded. Therefore, I believe that the Law and the prevailing exigencies demanded that the local government elections be postponed until the finalization of the delimitation process.
The minister highlighted the fact that the delay in conducting LG polls originated from the first delimitation report which was prepared under the previous government.
?It was a report made in an air-conditioned room on the instructions of the former minister Basil Rajapaksa. He wanted to use the delimitation report to keep all LG bodies under the SLFP. That is why all political parties including the UNP, JVP, TNA and all other minority parties vehemently opposed it. I like to ask the JVP and the JO where they were when the Rajapaksa government did this big blunder and thus delaying LG polls for more than two years,? the minister asked.
He vowed to expose all those who were responsible for this situation and challenged the JVP and the JO to win the no-confidence motion if possible. (Sandun A Jayasekera)

HARARE AFP Nov24, 2017-
Zimbabwe?s Emmerson Mnangagwa was set to be sworn in as president on Friday, marking the final chapter of a political drama that toppled his predecessor Robert Mugabe after a military takeover.? ?
Mnangagwa, until recently one of Mugabe?s closest allies, will take the oath of office at the national sports stadium on the outskirts of Harare before thousands of supporters, dignitaries and foreign diplomats.? ?
Mugabe, who ruled the southern African country for 37 autocratic years, was ousted from office when the military intervened after he had sacked Mnangagwa as vice president.? ? Mugabe, 93 and in increasingly frail health, had been positioning his wife Grace as his successor, but the army chiefs acted to halt the plan and usher in Mnangagwa.? ? ??Come and be an eyewitness of history being made, the historic ushering in (of) a new era and better country,? said a statement from the ruling ZANU-PF party calling on people to attend the inauguration.

Petition against Delimitation Gazette: AG assures party leaders to expedite hearing
	
It was reported that Attorney General Jayantha Jayasuriya PC had assured party leaders yesterday that he would move a motion next Monday (27) to take up the petition filed against the delimitation gazette on November 30.
The party leaders meeting was convened yesterday at the speaker?s office presided by Speaker Karu Jayasuriya and was attended by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, Attorney General and the Elections Commission Chairman.
The Prime Minister, party leaders, Attorney General and the Chairman of the elections commission had agreed that the local government elections should be held without delay.
The party leaders are reported to have put forward two proposals - firstly to expedite the case filed in court and resolve the matter related to the case and secondly to pass a special law to rectify the error in the gazette while the case was ongoing.
Another party leader had proposed to cancel the gazette notification. However the UNP had objected to the proposal.
Meanwhile, the Elections Commission Chairman had said that elections should be held in 133 local government bodies which were not affected by the stay order.
He has further said that the decision with regard to that would be taken at today?s election commission?s meeting.
However, even though party leaders had put forward several proposals, they had not reached at a consensus. (Ajith Siriwardana)

Smart condom vending machine in Colombo
	
The Family Planning Association of Sri Lanka (FPASL) has introduced a Smart Condom Vending Machine after considering the difficulties faced by the public when purchasing condoms.
The first Smart Condom Vending Machine is fixed outside the Family Planning Association of Sri Lanka building at the Bullers Lane, Colombo 07.
A FPASL Spokesperson told the Daily Mirror that the Smart Condom Vending Machine was a customized machine manufactured in Sri Lanka and was establish as a pilot project.
He said the FPASL identified the fact that the people were reluctant and shy to purchase condoms even from a pharmacy due to stigma resulting in unsafe sex.
Therefore, he said about 600 to 800 abortions per day had been recorded.
With the Smart Condom Vending, a fully automated machine, the customer can use easy cash and choose a product.
As it is yet a pilot project, only Dialog users can purchase it right now.
However, FPASL is expected to establish Smart Condom Vending Machine across the country after monitoring the first machine?s progress for two to three months.
The machine is expected to promote safe sex by encouraging the people to purchase condoms. (Thilanka Kanakarathna and Pix by Kushan Pathiraja)

Vast majority of suspects in graft probe agreeing to settlement, crown prince says
	
?
THE HINDU, 24th NOVEMBER, 2017-The vast majority of about 200 businessmen and officials implicated in a sweeping crackdown on corruption are agreeing to settlements under which they hand over assets to the government, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman told the New York Times.
We show them all the files that we have and as soon as they see those about 95 percent agree to a settlement, which means signing over cash or shares in their companies to the Saudi Treasury, the newspaper quoted Prince Mohammed as saying.
About 1 % are able to prove they are clean and their case is dropped right there. About 4 % say they are not corrupt and with their lawyers want to go to court.
Prince Mohammed repeated a previous official estimate that the government could eventually recover around $100 billion of illicit money through settlements.
The government said two weeks ago that it had questioned 208 people in the crackdown and released seven without charge. Dozens of princes, senior officials and top businessmen are believed to be held in Riyadh?s opulent Ritz Carlton hotel as their cases are processed.
