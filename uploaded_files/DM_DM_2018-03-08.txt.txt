Canada deeply concerned by violence in SL
	
The Canadian government said it was deeply concerned by the recent inter-communal violence in Sri Lanka and urged all sides to engage in inclusive dialogue and exercise restraint to ensure peace and stability.
Canadian Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland said;
Canada is deeply concerned by recent inter-communal violence in Sri Lanka, in which Muslims were targeted. Canada urges all sides to engage in inclusive dialogue and exercise restraint to ensure peace and stability. We call for an immediate end to hate and misinformation campaigns inciting sectarian violence.
Canada welcomes the Government of Sri Lankas condemnation of the violent acts. Canada calls on the government to ensure the safety and security of all minorities, to protect human rights and fundamental freedoms for all and to hold those responsible for the violence accountable. As we said at the United Nations Human Rights Council last month, frustrations persist among those trying to heal the wounds of Sri Lankas civil war. Ensuring that diversity and pluralism are valued is critical to the work of reconciliation in Sri Lanka.

Celebrating World Womens Day Bringing to light the role played by Women
	
Womens Liberation, the feminist movement, has been an ongoing encounter for over one and a half centuries. March 8 is the United Nations established International Womens Day. 
It is celebrated to bring to light the role and accomplishments of women in the socio-political field. The theme for this years International Womens Day is Press for Progress. The day will be marked with performances, marches, talks, rallies and networking events.
Where womens fundamental rights are concerned, there is more sex-based discrimination
	There are no adequate welfare programmes to assist them, worse, they are not appreciated in our society
International Womens Day looks to celebrate womens achievements, as well as proceed as a vehicle for change when it comes to gender equality. It has been observed for over a century and is now celebrated around the globe. The inaugural International Womens Day was held in New York on 28th February 1909. The event was organised by the Socialist Party of America. It was agreed that an international day should be named as part of a plan to promote womens suffrage and equal rights for them. 
With regard to the progress of womens rights Sri Lanka has a good record compared to other South Asian nations. However, we have to compare ourselves with developed nations. We consented for international standards in the womens convention in 1981. Our constitution has an article on equality. There has been a wearing away of rights with regard to gender based violence. Employment and political involvement are areas that we are yet to make adequate progress in. The laws are in place, but their implementation is extremely weak. 
The Enlightened One was the first guru who gave women equal opportunities in the field of spiritual advancement
Our female migrant workers contribute a high percentage of the total foreign exchange revenue earned by the island. There are no adequate welfare programmes to assist them, worse, they are not appreciated in our society. 
There should be more skills development efforts. These workers are exploited by agencies and foreign employers due to shortcomings in the regulatory structure, which needs to be corrected. 
Where womens fundamental rights are concerned, there is more sex-based discrimination in the private sector than in the state sector, where women have equal opportunity in terms of employment.

Employment Opportunities
There are several areas of employment in which women dont have equal openings. Unemployment statistics related to women are almost double when compared with that of men. This is true even with qualified women. Priority has to given when addressing this need. Most private sector firms are reluctant to employ women for the mere reason that they will ask for maternity leave; a right guaranteed under the constitution. Of course, there are a few women who have achieved great heights by climbing the corporate ladder and have even held posts such as CEO. They must not sell themselves and should take a tough stand against any kind of abuse. 
It was Eleanor Roosevelt who said, Nobody can Make you Feel Inferior without your Permission. Eleanor, the American politician, activist and diplomat and the First Lady of America during the Presidency of husband Franklin D. Roosevelt, made this much quoted statement. 

Gautama Buddha on Gender Equality
Gautama Buddha possessed the strength to compare motherhood to Buddhahood. He said, an excellent daughter is as dood as an excellent son. King of Kosala received a message from his castle that his queen had given birth to their first child and that it was a daughter. The birth of a female child was considered, during that time, as a sign of misfortune. The King hurried to Gautama Buddha and lamented. The Enlightened One appeased him making the above statement. 
When Gautama Buddha made his first visit home to the Kapilawastu castle after enlightenment his former wife declined to greet him. She said, If he is anxious let him come to me. Gautama Buddha, without any hesitation, walked into her chamber together with his two chief disciples. Buddhism teaches the husband to consider the wife as a companion, friend and partner. During those days a wife was expected to be a substitute in the event the husband happened to be indisposed. In Buddhist societies, the wife occupies an equal place with the husband. Gautama Buddha appreciated the social and physiological features that existed. The Enlightened One was the first guru who gave women equal opportunities in the field of spiritual advancement. This he did by purifying their minds which in turn enabled them to realise the bliss of Nibbana.
Under certain situations, Gautama Buddha mentioned in the Samyutta Nikaya, that women are more astute and wise than men. The testimonies of the Theris (Nuns) as described in Theri-gathas speak profusely of this fact. Gautama Buddha categorically laid down duties of a husband towards the wife in Sigalovada Sutta. Here Gautama Buddha emphasized that a husband should be polite and faithful to the wife and not despise her. The great teacher also said that a husband should leave the authority of running the house to the wife and provide her with adornments. 

What is Sexual harassment 
Sexual harassment according to the United Nations Human Rights Commission is an undesirable request for sexual favours, sexual advance, gesture of a sexual nature, verbal or physical conduct or, any other behaviour of a sexual nature that might reasonably be expected or be perceived to cause offence or humiliation to another. Sexual harassment may be unsolicited, deliberate and coercive.
Remember the dignity of your womanhood. Do not appeal, do not beg, and do not grovel; take courage 
- Christobel Roseanne Barr 

Forbidden Subject 
Reporters Without Borders (RSF) have published a report on the difficulties that journalists  both men and women  can encounter when they cover womens rights.
The paper entitled, Womens rights: Forbidden subject says, reporters covering womens rights face risks making it a forbidden subject. It further says, from 2012 to 2017, the rights of at least 90 journalists in around 20 countries were seriously violated because they dared to cover or talk about womens rights or gender issues. Several months of research has yielded the following chilling breakdown of these cases: 11 of these journalists were murdered, 12 were imprisoned, at least 25 were physically attacked and at least 40 others were or are still being threatened on social networks.
Unemployment statistics related to women are almost double when compared with that of men
The editor of the feminist weekly Gauri Patrike, Gauri Lankesh was gunned down on September 5, 2017, for articles that criticized the womans place in the caste system in India. Feminist journalists have been subjected to judicial harassment and imprisonment in Iran in connection with their writing on gender equality. Shojaee and Narges Mohammadi are two such victimsShojaee now lives in exile. However, not just women journalists are persecuted by the enemies of womens rights. Abdiaziz Ibrahim was arrested and sentenced to a prison term on a fake news charge in Somalia, for interviewing a rape victim, the paper adds. 
Journalists should not have to risk their lives in order to cover womens rights in 2018, but unfortunately they do in many parts of the world, the Secretary-general Christophe Deloire of RSF said. This report shows how enemies of press freedom obstruct coverage of womens rights and investigative reporting by journalists. We offer very clear recommendations to ensure that both halves of humanity enjoy the right to equal treatment by the media everywhere, without which we cannot talk of journalistic freedom and pluralism. 
Predators with Many Faces
RSFs report identifies fanatic religious groups such as the Taliban and Islamic State. Journalists who cover abortion rights in the United States receive death threats from pro-life groups. They often seek to silence reporters. Covering the many murders of women in Mexico is particularly risky. Authoritarian Governments led by those in Turkey, China, and Egypt- are also opposed to publishing womens issues for public debate. In Canada and France, and in many other developed countries, hordes of furious Internet users let loose cyber-harassment programmes against journalists. With women victims, the attacks become stronger and usually acquire a sexual dimension. 
In response to the harassment, some journalists have had no option, but to flee into exile, some have closed reporting and a few have chosen to defy. In their report, RSF pay compliment to all these journalists and offer recommendations to states, online platforms, international organizations, and news groups, so that womens rights are no longer observed as a forbidden subject and journalists who want to cover this topic can do so unreservedly. Women, be courageous, forthright and most importantly, honest. Have a target in life, which is within your reach and you must be audacious enough to reach it in spite of all the obstacles in your way.

Conspirators within the govt.: NFF
	
The recent sporadic incidents of violence had been created by a well-known gang with government patronage, National Freedom Front (NFF) National Organizer, Jayantha Samaraweera said.
He said it was a deliberate act of the government to create turmoil in the country with the intention of diverting the people's attention from the prevailing political and economic instabilities.
It is a well known secret as to who is involved in creating communal violence in the country. We are ready to disclose the truth in Parliament if a special Parliamentary session will be convened, considering the prevailing unrests, MP Samaraweera said.
He said the government was attempting to act according to the whims and fancies of foreign countries including the USA and India by creating unnecessary issues in the country.
He said the International Convention on Protection of Persons from Enforced Disappearances Bill which was passed in Parliament on Wednesday, was not applicable and lawful.
The provisions of the constitution are sufficient to penalize those who are involved in the disappearances. But by having extra laws means that the government is acting according to the aspirations of the Tamil Diaspora, he added. (Sheain Fernandopulle)

The government has benefitted from the recent acts of violence in the country, the Pivithuru Hela Urumaya (PHU) said yesterday.
PHU General Secretary and MP Udaya Gammanpila told a news conference that the pressure on political parties including the United National Party (UNP) to remove Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe from his post had now been suppressed due to the spree of terror attacks instigated by communal violence.
The joint opposition will not be benefitted from these incidents in any manner. We, as the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP), have won the majority of votes from the Sinhalese in the recent election. We now attempt to win the votes of the minority groups. The JO or SLPP does not need to attack any community."
"However, the UNP is having a huge benefit over these barbaric acts. If this uncivilized behaviour do not stop immediately, the country will face a huge crisis in future. I am requesting all Sinhalese to intervene and bring this situation under control, he said. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)

J. Walter Thompson Colombo Tapping Into Female Capital
	
J. Walter Thompson Sri Lanka launched 2018 with a preview of Female Tribes, A conversation on Motherhood which is due to be released in full this May. Weve spent the last year in conversation with 100 people about the idea & realities of motherhood said Alyna Haji Omar CEO of J. Walter Thompson Sri Lanka. First time mums, young girls talking about their mums. Young women evaluating the choices before them, single mums, single dads playing double roles, Full-time dads reinventing the rules, LGBT mums, not-mums, celebrity mums. Weve spoken to so many wonderful people & retold these conversation through design, the first preview was launched in January and were thrilled with the reactions to it across the market.
A large proportion of the brands we work with are mainly targeted at women but the masculinity of marketing remains a real barrier in reaching out to women in a meaningful way. We believe in female capital, it highlights the value women bring to the world: as women. We need to know the value of women as leaders, politicians, economists, scientists, pioneers, activists, athletes, actors and artists. This first edition of Female Tribes does that through a powerful and incredibly insightful series of design stories.
Commenting on her journey as the CEO of JWT since June 2015 Alyna said In just over 2 years we have completely transformed the Sri Lanka operation making us a more vibrant, digitally led, strategically rooted creative powerhouse that is in every way ahead of the curve within the local industry. We set out to recalibrate our legacy, we restructured and established new KPIs and drove an entirely different, more aggressive and certainly more progressive agenda, building core competencies around Female Capital was and continues to be a central focus  looking back on the last 2 plus years weve hired 80% women, our teams are equally represented, my leadership team is equally represented, my junior leadership team in dominated by women, 2 out of 3 core departments are led by women, our last winner of the global high potentials program a woman  the ROI is powerful, over 400% growth in just over 2 years. 90% pitch win rate, attrition at a record low, client retention at a record high the future is female! 
Tarun Rai, CEO of J. Walter Thompson South Asia had this to say on JWTs Sri Lankas recent successes Our Sri Lanka operations have been on a roll ever since Alyna took over as CEO. And I am not all surprised at their amazing success. The atmosphere in the office is electric. The energy is palpable. They are trying out new things. And most important, having fun. Alyna was my first appointment as I took over my new role at JWT and I am very proud of her achievements. She is not only the youngest woman agency CEO in Sri Lanka but in the entire South Asia region. And she has a fantastic bunch of very capable, senior women along with her to drive JWT Sri Lanka to even greater success. 
I find that being a women- led agency infuses the team with a powerful blend of empathy and courage that has played no small part in building enduring relationships, not only with our clients but with our partners and colleagues as well, said Michelle Georgesz, Director of Client Services. We believe it is important to break barriers and stereotypes and through our ongoing research, we believe we have found genuine insights and not just pre- conceived assumptions into female behavior.
Asela De Silva,Head of Creative of J. Walter Thompson Sri Lanka, Being a creative in the industry for quite awhile, I have found that when the team is diverse, there is definitely an edge when tapping into insights and the ideas that come out of it, and subsequently the campaigns are more authentic, powerful and resonates with people better.
With over 150 years of experience, the J. Walter Thompson group specialises in creating pioneeringsolutions that transform brands and businessesand change the world. JWT along with Contract, Fortune, Design Sutra and Small Fry Studio offers end to end brand solutions. The group has been in Sri Lanka for over 35 years and handles a diverse portfolio of international & local brands that includes telcos, aviation, tourism, FMCG, healthcare, financial services, construction fashion and sports etc.

## Title: Kamal Addararachchi An actors sensibility

Kamal Addararachchi An actors sensibility
	
When Kamal Addararachchi struts or strolls into a sequence of a film, he is deliberately flamboyant, because he wants to let us know he is THERE. But his flamboyance is not what vindicates him, because for a career spanning 35 years 35 films and roles are all he got, and if flamboyance figured in there he would have got more, much more, than what he ended up with. Within a limited canvas Kamal thus gives the best hes got. He is choosy, more than a little selective and picky, so the few performances we remember with almost sensuous excitement  the hero of Saptha Kanya and Julietge Boomikawa, the prodigal son of Loku Duwa and Awaragira  we remember quite well. Kamals face in this sense has been his biggest strength, or at least one of his biggest strengths, because it can convey infatuation and dislike. That he has teetered between two broad kinds of roles  as mentioned before, the lover and the prodigal son  and variations thereof speaks volumes about the fact that to be a flamboyant performer isnt necessarily to have a diverse range.
And being flamboyant has its pitfalls, moreover: if you dont evoke enough interest in the audience, you will fail them, no matter how many charades and pageants you summon with your physique. Thats why his lesser supporting performances dont stand out  whether as Chandrasoma in Kaliyugaya or as the political son in his debut film, Sagarayak Meda  not because he doesnt try or retain enough conviction, but because hes so apparent and outlandish that we need him to be the star of the vehicle he is in, and in these two films he is not that kind of star. We dont care whether we root for him or oppose him  and he has acted in many movies which have him as a dislikeable son or sister or wayward womaniser  but we do care whether he stands out. By standing out, he defines himself, not in relation to his other characters and how they regard him, but by himself. He operates from a world of his own.
Kamals debut as a thespian was aboard a satirical play titled Ane Ablick, first performed in Colombo in 1978. What happened next was in one sense inevitable: a film producer, having seen him act, got him to meet another Fonseka, no less a figure than Gamini Fonseka, over a film that the two of them were planningon doing
Kamal is serious about his standards and the roles they land him. Apart from one film (each) by Roy de Silva, Sunil Soma Peiris, and Anton Gregory, he hasnt exactly moved into the mainstream cinema. All he wants, in that sense, is to be and to remain pure and pristine, a tough enterprise in a country and industry where popular audiences tend to shirk the halls if those halls arent screening a product from that mainstream cinema. The fact that we endear ourselves to him, no matter what kind of movie hes in, attests to the fact that he is indifferent to this reality in our industry, yet triumphs. We need to see him, and in the end, we measure him up by the strut, the tones, the accent, the inflections, and everything else that he has nurtured and built for himself.
Addararachchige Gunendra Kamal was born on February 5, 1962 to a gem merchant family in Ratnapura. He was sent to Wesley College, Colombo, where he developed an interest in the arts: among other activities, he had been the drummer in a five-piece schoolboy band called Cats Eyes. By his own confession though, neither the theatre nor the cinema held much promise for him. By the time he entered Grade Five, he began acting in dialogues-driven, serious productions, but for his shift to the performing arts, he had to have a guiding figure, a figure of destiny. That figure of destiny was Gamini Samarakoon, who taught him drama in Grade Nine. As Kamal told me around two years ago, More than drama, he taught me miming. That marked my first brush with the medium. With Samarakoon came a horde of other influences: Nimal Fernando, a primary class teacher, Heig Karunaratne, who taught him not just drama but also music as he went up, and Shelton Weerasinghe, the Principal at Wesley who did much to uplift the arts.
The liaison between his school and the outside world, incidentally, was Karunaratne, who advised Kamal to apply for an acting course he had come across in the newspapers. That course was to be conducted by a leading theatre practitioner named Dr. Nobert J. Mayar, from Germany, and was sponsored and organised by the International Theatre for Children and Youth (ITCY). It would span three months and some workshops, almost all of which Kamal enthusiastically took part in. I never regretted Mr. Karunaratnes request. I obliged and I have since looked back with unyielding gratitude. The three-month course got him to meet three people who would figure in his career, as colleagues: Jayantha Chandrasiri and Sriyantha Mendis. All three had, moreover, been tutored by another leading figure: Dr Salamon Fonseka, according to Kamal the first Sri Lankan to have a PhD in drama and theatre.
We need to see him, and in the end, we measure him up by the strut, the tones, the accent, the inflections, and everything else that he has nurtured and built for himself
All that remains in my mind of Fonseka, regrettably, is the image of him as the manservant to the hamu mahaththaya in Parakrama Niriellas Siri Medura, but the truth of the matter is that he was more, much more, than a supporting player in the occasional film. Fonseka, those who studied under him (and there were quite a few: Sriyantha, Prageeth Ratnayake, Palitha Silva, and an acquaintance of mine who doesnt act but knows the field well) will attest, did what no one, not even Gunasena Galappaththy or Dhamma Jagoda before him did: bring method acting to Sri Lanka through a series of structured, academic courses designed to evince Stanislawskys founding principles. While Jagoda and Galappaththy had learnt of the Method in America, Fonseka had gone to Europe itself. No doubt Kamal was enriched by his encounters with the man.
Kamals debut as a thespian was aboard a satirical play titled Ane Ablick, first performed in Colombo in 1978. What happened next was in one sense inevitable: a film producer, having seen him act, got him to meet another Fonseka, no less a figure than Gamini Fonseka, over a film that the two of them were planning on doing. The film, which would mark Gaminis fourth foray into the world of directing, was Sagarayak Meda, and in it the young Kamal would be featured as the Marxist, sloganeering son to the apolitical hero (played by Gamini himself). He was, needless to say, perturbed but also excited: perturbed, because he hadnt opened himself to the cinema and because he knew that his parents would not allow him there; excited, because the next step after stage dramas for a budding actor was the film industry.
In the end, he lied to his mother and father. By the time he was caught, red-handed, and reprimanded, Sagarayak Meda was already being screened in the theatres. From that point on, he revelled in playing out two distinct kinds of characters: the everyman bewildered by fortuitous circumstances (Saptha Kanya, Guerrilla Marketing), and, as I pointed out at the beginning of this piece, the thoughtless, callous, cruel prodigal son. As the former, he compels our empathy and makes us want to win; as the latter, he gets us to envision his own end, as with both Loku Duwa (where hes beaten to a pulp by Gamini Fonseka) and Awaragira (where he is stabbed to death in the end). No matter what his performance is, I sense a subtle intermingling of goodness and badness, so much so that even when he teeters to one side of that big divide, he retains enough from the other side to keep himself from sliding down that forever easy path of being a stereotyped character actor.

Lack of progress in SL: UN could use universal jurisdiction
	
UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Prince Zeid Al-Hussein yesterday said he was alarmed by recent violent incidents in Sri Lanka and said he would encourage UN Member States to explore the use of universal jurisdiction in the absence of progress in accountability and transitional justice in Sri Lanka.
In his annual report and oral update to the 37th session of the Human Rights Councilon the activities of his office and recent human rights developments, Prince Zeid said there should be no impunity, either for the incitement that led to the attacks, or the attacks themselves.
"In Sri Lanka, I am very alarmed by recurring and continuing episodes of mob violence targeting ethnic and religious minorities, particularly Muslims, including the most recently in Ampara and in several locations in the Kandy District, leading to the declaration of a nationwide state of emergency for 10 days, he said.
He said he has repeatedly urged the Sri Lanka Government to advance its implementation of the transitional justice agenda.
"I regret the absence of meaningful progress. It is urgent, for the sake of the victims, that progress be made on accountability and transitional justice. In the absence of such progress I would encourage Member States to explore the use of universal jurisdiction. The Council will be fully briefed in this regard on March 21, he said.

NBTS seeks blood brothers!
	
Donating blood is a meritorious deed that helps save many lives. The National Blood Transfusion Services (NBTS), attached to the Ministry of Health, is a decentralized unit which is the sole supplier of blood and blood products to state hospitals, including private institutions registered under the Ministry of Health. The NBTS recently announced that there is an impending risk of going through a blood shortage from the period of January to April this year. 
According to NBTS Deputy Director Dr. Deepa Saranajeewa, approximately 400 to 450 thousand units of blood from voluntary blood donors are collected annually by the NBTS island wide. Any volunteer between the ages of 18 and 55 with a healthy body weight not less than 50 Kg can donate blood whereas in the case of a regular blood donor, the individual can donate blood up to the age of 60 years. Moreover, it is crucial to ensure that the donor is physically fit and is not under medication for any chronic illness or is not suffering from any disease or infection. It isnt recommended for an individual to donate blood if he or she has traveled abroad within the past three months at the time of the blood donation. While a whole blood donor can donate blood every four months, it should be noted that platelet donors can donate blood after a two week interval. 

Shortage of Blood
Expressing his views to the Daily Mirror, Director of the National Blood Transfusion Services (NBTS) Dr. Rukshan Bellana said that during the period between January and April, a blood shortage is experienced every year. He said that the situation could worsen in the event an election is held during the given period.

It is a usual phenomenon to experience a blood shortage between January and April annually. We experienced this shortage this year too. On top of that, we had the elections in February. During the election period, it is normal to witness a drop in the blood supply. This year, both these factors coincided, Dr. Bellana stated. 
If we dont do anything about it, we will walk into a crisis by next month or April. We have carried out a massive campaign during the past two or three weeks through our blood bank networks, he added. 
The NBTS has been instrumental in carrying out several effective blood donation campaigns throughout the country in a bid to raise awareness on the importance of donating blood while ensuring that the risk of an impending blood shortage would be countered via such an endeavour. Stating that the recent blood campaign that was held in Kaththankudi was a success, Dr. Bellana added that it was the first time in history that a blood donation campaign was held in Kaththankudi. The campaign attracted 600 donors and to date this has been the highest ever statistic associated with a blood donation campaign held in the Batticaloa District. The blood donation campaign at Kaththankudi was organized by a Senior Consultant of Classic Travels (Pvt) Ltd and social worker, Rizwan Hafiz in collaboration with the NBTS. 
We have carried out a massive campaign during the past two or three weeks through our blood bank networks
Among the donors, the majority were represented by the Muslim community. Among them there were also ladies with burkhas who volunteered to donate blood. Their participation has helped dispel recent rumors, that it is considered bad to donate blood according to their religious practice. We held a similar campaign last Saturday (Feb. 17) in the Batticaloa town with nearly 160 donors. Though this campaign didnt attract a big crowd, it was nevertheless a record set for the Batticaloa region when considering statistics of the past couple of years. 
So, we have stepped up the campaign activities and we are seeing some improvement. We are seeing how people are coming and extending support to this noble cause. Given the situation, I hope we might not run into a crisis, but we would have definitely experienced one if we had not acted in advance, Dr. Bellana said. 
A successful blood donation campaign is often a joint endeavor of several groups
Upon inquiring about how Colombo has coped with the situation pertaining to an impending blood shortage, he said that Colombo is always the highest in terms of available blood donors since it is congested with the highest population. However, noting that the same could not be applied in the case of Batticaloa, Dr. Bellana said that this was one of the main reasons why a blood donation campaign was organized in the said region. Highlighting that the situation in Hambantota is very unsatisfactory at present, Dr. Bellana informed that the NBTS is planning to organize its next blood donation campaign in this town in the near future. 
In the overall, we are doing well in certain regions and not so well in other regions. I dont think Batticaloa will be a problem hereafter because we have had a good campaign here. Also, we have raised awareness among people and blood donation has been promoted among them.The blood donated by donors, free of charge, during the campaign is collected and stored. Then we issue this to the public and private sectors for medical reasons as per their needs, he added. 

Accidents and Traumas
Explaining that accidents and traumas make up a high number of cases which demand blood, he added that surgeries which are growing in numbers, and are an everyday occurrence, have a greater demand for blood supply. Thalassaemia and cancer patients also require blood very often.
Not so long ago, we used to supply a lot of blood to treat dengue patients. Now since the treatment patterns have changed, not much blood is required to treat dengue patients although earlier we had a huge demand in this aspect. The number of major diseases, surgeries and accidents has increased at present, which is why we need more blood. It should also be noted when you take the Sri Lankan community, O+ is the type of blood that is mostly available within the community. O-, AB- and AB+ blood groups are very rare in the public, Dr.Bellana said. 

Organizing a Blood Donation Campaign
To take part in this noble venture, it is important to know how to organize a blood donation campaign in ones locality. Deemed to be a meritorious act, donating blood for those in need is indeed a good cause that would save many lives. Enlightening us on the procedure, NBTS Deputy Director Dr. Deepa Saranajeewa shared her views on the subject. She said that it would be ideal to arrange blood donation camps during the April festive season and that blood donors are most welcome to donate blood. 
A successful blood donation campaign is often a joint endeavor of several groups comprising Government and non-government organizations, private institutions, friends and volunteer groups. It should be noted that at least 50 donors should take part in a week day donor campaign whereas a weekend donor campaign is expected to attract at least 100 donors. On the other hand, a volunteer can donate blood at the premises of National Blood Centre Narahenpita anytime between 8.00 am and 6.00 pm. This centre is open all 365 days of the year. Donors can also donate blood at any of the hospital based blood banks between 8.00 am and 4.00 pm, Dr. Saranajeewa said. 
Among the donors, the majority were represented by the Muslim community
Explaining further on how to arrange a campaign, Dr. Saranajeewa said that the camp premise should be a familiar location to donors comprising sanitary facilities such as a washroom in addition to facilities such as parking space, clean and be a calm atmosphere. While laying emphasis that the NBTS doesnt approve anyone except volunteers as donors, she further highlighted that organizers will be called for a meeting by respective blood bank networks prior to hosting the campaign to educate them on the procedures pertaining to organizing the event. The necessary equipment for blood transfusion would be provided by the NBTS. 
Mass blood mobiles with the participation of 1000 to 3000 donors are generally conducted by the National Blood Centre and Cluster Centre blood banks since they have the required capacity. Additionally, the NBTS wishes to invite the public to celebrate their life events by organizing a blood donation campaign at the blood bank premises. Also, those who are willing to donate blood can register themselves at the NBTS, which maintains a donor registry. This is very useful for the NBTS in the event of an emergency, in which case the NBTS can call and request a registered donor to donate blood added Dr. Saranajeewa.

No more grief and tears! International Womens Day falls on March 8
	
We commemorate International Womens Day with a heavy heart. We have fought for the setting up of the Office on Missing Persons and securing 25% reservation for women in the Local Government Elections part from engaging in a myriad of other struggles. While we continue these struggles with a lot of hope, we are witnessing a rise in communal violence which erupted in our neighborhood. 
On March 6, Sri Lanka came under a state of emergency for the first time since it was removed in 2011. It was after 28 years that the state of emergency was lifted, then. On 30th November 2017, as tensions were rising among Muslim and Tamil communities in the East, and online hate speech was rampant, we as women of Batticaloa issued a strong public statement condemning communal violence. As representatives of Muslim and Tamil women we stood together at the sites where tensions had erupted and called for an end to the violence and hate speech. 
Now, in March 2018, the communal tensions are spreading like wildfire. 
In Ampara, On the 26th and 27th of February four shops and a Mosque and other properties were damaged and at least three persons were injured. The violence is said to have erupted after a group of Sinhala youth, alleged that sterilization pills were added to a meal served by a Muslim-owned restaurant to a Sinhala customer. On 3rd March 2018, M.G. Kumarasinghe from Moragahamulla, succumbed to his injuries at the Kandy Hospital after being beaten allegedly by a gang of Muslim men in Theldeniya. This incident happened on the 22nd of February. It is widely believed that the violence resulted due to a conflict that took place following a traffic incident. Four suspects were remanded by the Police until 7th of March. Following his death, on the 5th of March, hundreds of Sinhala persons stormed Moragahamulla village and burned down several Muslim shops. A Buddhist monk from a temple in Batticaloa town was seen in photographs alongside the mobs in Theldeniya. Abdul Fazith, from Digana, Kandy, died when his house/shop was set on fire on the 6th of March. 
We stand in sorrow with the families of both M.G. Kumarasinghe and Abdul Fazith. 
We, as women of Sri Lanka, of diverse ethnic and religious identities, call upon our Government and the opposition parties to respond in a responsible manner. 
We, as women of Sri Lanka, of diverse ethnic and religious identities, call for our government and opposition parties to respond in a responsible and urgent manner. We urge them to maintain law and order without further curtailing democratic rights of citizens. We have learnt many a lesson that to curtail peaceful democratic voices only further deepens social rifts and escalate violence leading to tragic loss.
We call on our brothers and sisters, to reach out across these divisions with love and trust. We call on them to make public symbolic acts of solidarity and support, and to speak out against hate speech online and in everyday life.
This International Womens Day, we want no more violence, no more grief, no more tears. We are Sri Lankan and this violence is not in our name.

Peeping tom got what he deserved
	
A bachelor who was a peeping tom and used to watch women bathing on the sly along with a friend was forced to undergo an embarrassing situation recently.
On this particular day several women were bathing at the well that was surrounded by a brick wall. The two peeping toms as usual placed their coconut branch against the wall and were about to engage in their usual 'thrill'. They had been drinking. One of them climbed up while the other held on to the coconut branch to support his friend. They took turns doing this.
The man holding onto the coconut branch suddenly felt something behind him and looking over his shoulder he spotted a dog that started to come menacingly toward him. In his haste to avoid getting bitten by the dog he let go of the coconut branch, causing his friend, who was 'busy' on top, to lose his balance. As he was about to fall over his friend below regained his composure and tried to grab him. However he was only able to grab hold of his shorts thereby causing him to fall down naked into the midst of the women below, causing them to get alarmed and then become angry when they realised what these two perverts had been up to.
They proceeded to give this peeping-tom just what he deserved, a good hiding. (Upendra Priyankara Jathungama)

Ready to help Govt. to restore normalcy: MR
	
Former President and MP Mahinda Rajapaksa yesterday assured that his party was ready to support the government in their hour of need to restore normalcy in the country.
Addressing a hurriedly arranged news briefing at his residence in Colombo last evening, Mr. Rajapaksa said Joint Opposition (JO) Leader MP Dinesh Gunawardane had phoned both the President and Prime Minister in this regard.
We have no problem about offering our fullest support to the government, if it requires our assistance. In fact, Minister Lakshman Kiriella asked me to speak to the people at this crucial juncture. We request everyone to act wisely, stay calm and be patience in order to maintain law and order in the country, he said.
He reiterated the inaction of the government had aggravated the tense situation and said the government had got it all wrong.
Whenever something went wrong during my tenure, including the violence at Rathupaswala or Aluthgama, the blame was put on me. Today, the government is placing the blame on the police. This only agitates the people as then they have no one to turn to, he said.
When asked about moves by the government to block social media to prevent false news from spreading, Mr. Rajapaksa said it was an unwise move.
Many people, especially those from the business community, have complained to us about how this has affected their businesses, he said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

Role: A Diagnostic Approach to Performance Practical guide for future leaders
	
Business Athlete Founder CEO, Bradley Emerson recently launched his book titled Role: A Diagnostic Approach to Performance in which he discusses a plethora of practical elements contributing to the performance of management practitioners. In the comprehensive guide, business tycoon Emerson avows that though education and experience qualify employees for the role, sustaining the performance largely depends on the external factors influencing the role and internal drivers sustaining performance. Following are several comments made by vibrant personalities on the book:

Framework to ensure individual career success
Prof. Sattar Bawany
Chairman/CEO, Centre for Executive Education (CEE Global) & Strategic Adviser, International Professional Managers Association (IPMA, UK)
There are two things we can say with certainty about the future: it will be different and surprising. Now, more than ever, employees at all levels have to navigate unfamiliar, challenging times, a quickening pace of change, increasing expectations, and a rising tide of rapidly-evolving conditions. I highly recommend this book as it provides a framework on Role  A Diagnostic approach to Performance for every role or job position to ensure individual career success by examining the critical elements will impact performance from both the perspective of the employer (organisation) and the employee.

A must-read for everyone
Datin Malliga Subramaniam
Certified Career Coach & Senior Managing Partner, Shadowdata Software, Sdn, Bhd
This is a must-read for everyone who aspires to progress and maintain control over whats important with their personal development. The diagnostic approach to role breaks down winning approach to understanding any role and ace it.


Behaviour comes before performance
Peter DAlmeida
Managing Director/Chief Executive, N*able
I found it quite fascinating because Bradley draws attention to three things during the course of the book: role, behaviour and performance. First it lays out that the role is beyond a prescriptive role, it goes beyond your job description and he makes the case that in your role there are expectations from a bunch of people whom you may not necessarily be aware of. The book takes on a very unconventional implication that behaviour comes before performance. Bradley says sometimes we behave the role even before we execute it.
He proves that those who perform are those who keep their own future in their minds. If your goals are not aligned to the company goals, either you change and conform or you quit and move on. He implies that the transition from behaviour to performance can be done through visualization and purpose. Unless you are able to make this transition, you will never be a top performer. The book is a good example which proves that we need to focus on the simple things we can do to make a meaningful change in business and in the lives of people of this country. 

Driving performance through individual ownership
Surani Amerasinghe
Head of Human Resources, Lion Breweries PLC
An excellent guide to taking charge of your own destiny, both in your career and personal aspirations. A vital handbook that would assist in driving performance through individual ownership. 





I was in for a pleasant shock
L. Chiranthi Cooray
DGM HR/Chief HR Officer, HNB PLC
Simple, practical and a compelling read. Having scoured through many a management and HR textbook, I picked up the manuscript ready to retire into technical reading and purely to do the honours for a friend and professional peer. I was in for a pleasant shock. I was spellbound by the clarity, simplicity and the forthrightness of the book. It didnt leave my hand until I got to the very end. Bradley has deftly woven decades of leadership experience into an authentic prescription to cure role related dysfunctions, a malaise that strikes many leaders, professionals and organizations today. This is an excellent read for those of us who hover the corporate world, seeking new learning and solutions, what to do and not to do as leaders, provided with practical insights.


Commendable knowledge guide for managers
Dr. Qaisar Abbas - Professor of HRD and Director COMSATS University, Lahore
It is a novel handbook for management practitioners with multiple hats that commendably guides on diagnosing their and that of their teams roles for harnessing excellence in performance in organisational and personal affairs turning this challenge into a simple, precise and achievable practice. This book remarkably integrates and simplifies necessary concepts that managers need to incorporate in routine exercise for paving success towards targeted achievements, goals and self-glory. A commendable knowledge guide for managers with multiple portfolios!

SAITMs continuation as usual except new student admissions
	
The Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) yesterday said the proceedings at the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM ) was continuing as usual except the new student admissions despite the governments policy decision to abolish it.
GMOA Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge told a news conference that the academic activities including the holding of examinations were still conducting in the SAITM in an unlawful manner.
He said the government had already declared a policy decision to abolish SAITM and to enrol all its students to medical faculty of Sir John Kotelawala Defence University (KDU), considering their basic qualifications.
Following this condition, SAITM students are again falling into a trouble and they have been used to accomplish several agendas. What is the validity of these examinations which are holding by the SAITM despite its abolishment, he said.
He said the government should immediately intervene to this issue and to make the needed legal background to solve this confusion. He also said the government to immediately gazette its policy decision on SAITM in order to make it a reality.
Meanwhile, he said SAITM Chairman Dr. Neville Fernando had asked the students to pay arrears and penalty fees with regard to the installments before March 7 in order to continue with their studies.
He said it was dubious whether Dr. Fernando had the lawful authority to make such a notice. He also said it could be considered as a financial fraud.
While referring to the advertisement published in print media on the selling of the Neville Fernando Teaching Hospital (NFTH), he said it was questionable how a private party could sell a property which was already acquired by the government.
He said several authorities including Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne had claimed that the government had acquired the NFTH in July.
The NFTH in the advertisement said Dr. Neville Fernando Teaching Hospital, Malabe, a thousand bed hospital with all modern hi-tech equipment, for immediate sale and it added that the government valuation is Rs. 3.55 billion. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)

The Prime Minister assured that the government would be able to control the situation and to bring in normalcy.
He added that curfew needed to be reinforced in Kandy following a grenade explosion last evening. Summarising what had occurred in Kandy, he said the violence had begun after a driver was assaulted and killed in Theldeniya.

Regional Development Minister Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka today said he was against the appointment of Minister Ranjith Madduma Bandara as the new Law and Order Minister by President Maithripala Sirisena this morning.
Minister Fonseka told the media in Colombo following an event, that this appointment was made without prior information to Minister Bandara.
Minister Bandara was unaware of this appointment. He was summoned to the Presidential Secretariat suddenly this morning and was appointed as the Law and Order Minister. I am feeling disgusted of these kinds of decisions and I strongly condemn them, he said.
Meanwhile, he said many of the Rajapaksas and their supporters were against the governments suggestion to appoint him as the Law and Order Minister since they knew that he would enforce the law in a perfect manner. He also said the corrupt parties attached to the Rajapaksas had considered him as a challenge to them.
He said the United National Party (UNP) was never against the suggestion to appoint him as the Law and Order Minister and added that members attached to the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) and United Peoples Freedom Alliance (UPFA) had also congratulated him in advance.
Only the people who are blessing the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) are afraid of the suggestion to appoint me as the Law and Order Minister, he said.

The city and the hinterland in Singapore
	
I assume that the government is using the Singapore model of economic development, which focuses on services and not on agriculture or industry. In the 1970s when economic development or development economics became the favourite subject of politics and economics I was lucky to do a one year post graduate diploma in Oxford University for government officers. One question raised was How valid is the Singapore model and the short answer given by Robert Mabro, an Egyptian academic who ran the course was: Singapore has no hinterland.
The recent local body elections which took on a kind of national referendum image were in the hinterland and appear to confirm that thesis that the Singapore model is invalid for a country with a hinterland. Singapore is only a city state. The reader can work out for himself what this implies and it includes what the recent local elections have conveyed as a message. 
Lets look back briefly on the history of economic development in the last couple of centuries in our country. Economic development in its transformational mode began with the Colebrooke Reforms of 1832 which freed the country from the feudal system, made the factors of production: land, labour and capital available and mobile for exploitation and development. The Sri Lankan middle class or bourgeousie was a product of this freeing of the economy and society.
Education, employment and a new social and political structure came into being. This macro view is based on the universally accepted proposition popularized by Marx that matter precedes mind. In 2000 AD when the Time Magazine carried out a world survey as to who was the most influential person in the 10 centuries since the year 1000 A.D. the choice was Karl Marx. 
We know how our country adapted to the internal and external changes since 1500. We now have a free and self governing society, based on the rule of law, equality and freedom. The very recent events like the defeat of the Eelamists, consolidation of a unitary state and economy, the political activity based on the separation of powers and one man one vote have strengthened this process. The latest all country round of elections for local authorities has clarified and strengthened the political system.

The results of the local elections illustrate the thesis that the Singapore model of a city state does not fit a country like Sri Lanka, which has a hinterland, independent of the city and able to influence the activity of the city. Even in the case of Singapore we can see in the relationship with Malaysia the strong economic bond with the hinterland, Malaysia. In Ceylon/Sri Lanka however the connection is unbreakable and this is the lesson that the recent local elections has produced. 
The familiar signs of the Singapore model are with us in Colombo. High rise buildings all over the city with no indication of any kind of moderation respecting the wishes of its citizens. I remember a Singapore taxi driver telling me when I told him I was from Colombo a few years ago. 
Colombo. Wonderful place. Lot of room. Can live on the ground. Not in the sky. 
Meanwhile the other worse aspect is also there: digging up the sea and putting iron towers in it. Galle Face was the face of our island beauty. It is now made up of iron structures and both water and sky have given up. The made up maiden is no longer worth visiting. 
Thank God we have a hinterland and that the democratic system expressed the views of the hinterland. And expressed the suppressed wishes of the city.

The typical Jaffna culture has drastically changed
	
Celebrated poet S. Pathmanathan says that overcoming linguistic barriers will help bridge gap between the North and South
Literature should be for the people; and poets and writers should function as the voice of the people representing the vast majority, says S. Pathmanathan, a poet and a translator from Jaffna. Pathmanathan, fondly referred to as SoPa, is a product of Jaffna Hindu College who had had an interest in literature since his younger days. During his career he had served as the Principal of the Palaly Training College from 1993 to 1996 and also travelled abroad to master the English language on several occasions. His collections of poetry include Vadakiruthal (1998), NinaivuChuvaduhal (2005) and Suvattecham (2009) while his translations have appeared in the Journal of South Asian Literature (1987), Penguin New Writing in Sri Lanka (1992), Lutesong and Lament (2001) and A Lankan Mosaic (2002). Having bagged two State Literary Awards, four Provincial Awards, the Governors Award and the Kalabhooshanam Award, SoPa strives to make a positive change in society through literature. While on a recent visit to Jaffna, the daily mirror caught up with this visionary poet. Amidst bell chimes from a nearby kovil, SoPa quite enthusiastically expressed his views about how the language barrier could bridge the North and the South while also elaborating the role of writers.
Excerpts:
Q Tell us about your experiences as a poet in Jaffna.
I was in Government service right throughout my life. For a brief period I was a clerk just to find a foothold. But then I thought this is not what I want to do. I loved to teach and therefore wanted to be a teacher. So when I had the opportunity, I became a teacher in 1964. Then I went for training in English teaching and it became my vocation there onwards. While being a teacher I also entered university, graduated and continued my career, starting from the early 1980s. After that I was appointed as a lecturer at the Palali Teachers College which was a prestigious teachers college in the North. Then for six years I served in the Eastern Province. It was compulsory to serve in the remote areas once we received training and I believe that its a very good system. Thereafter I was offered a scholarship in the UK. This was for Teacher Trainers, which was the terminology in the West. 
In the meantime the war aggravated. The 83 riots took place and the Teachers College got displaced. People started moving up and down and it was chaos. Likewise many things happened between 1983 and 1995. It was the most gruesome and troublesome period in this part of the country. I continued in service till 1999 and retired thereafter. So whenever Im motivated or inspired or feel like expressing myself, I write. There was enough material to write about; the war was reaching the land here and unprecedented things were happening. People were facing difficulties. They were being displaced not to mention the shelling and things which became the order of the day. I have been busy even after retiring in 1999. I didnt want to idle. So I did most of my publications after retirement. 
Q What are you inspired by in your literary career
I have a fairly good grounding in Tamil literature. But my horizons were widened since I learned English literature. Therefore my inspirations were mainly Tamil classics. I have also devoted a part of my writing for translations since I thought there werent many translations done during that time. People dont get through these linguistic barriers. Most of the problems in this country are due to the fact that theres a big language barrier between the North and the South. When we were young it wasnt so because English helped us to communicate with the Sinhalese. Apart from the language problem the two communities were moving further and further away.
Q What are the immediate actions that need to be taken to fix this language barrier
There could be an exchange between the North and South. For example the Government would select 50 best students who have done their O/L Examination to be sent to Japan. In return 50 Japanese students will visit Sri Lanka. But more than such a programme, an exchange within the country would be more effective. This should be given priority. But in terms of sports we should be happy that one girl from Jaffna bagged two gold medals recently in an All Island sports event. Such events would positively contribute in bridging this gap between the North and the South. 
Q You mentioned about Tamil classics and literature which we have seldom heard of. Tell us about some genres in Tamil works of literature.
Tamil literature is rich in Bakthi literature which means devotion. By this we refer to the literature that came around the seventh to the 12th Century mainly in Tamil. We also had out own tradition. People were religious because there are many temples and kovils.
Temple festivals are still a part of our lives. Temples were also not places of worship, but places where religious discourses were taking place. I was inspired by Harikatha which means katha of Hari. This is Krishnas story found in the Ramayana, Mahabaratha and other epics.
Those religious discourses werent speeches, but they were recited and sung to the accompaniment of music. They were so catchy and as a schoolboy I used to sit at these discourses and listen to them. That would be my first inspiration. The uncle who brought me up was a great fan of this programme and I eventually became used to it. Epics are a great storehouse of many stories. 
Q The exchange of heritage and culture in Jaffna was challenged as a result of the war. Nine years after the war, dont you think now is the right time for the North and South to get together
During this war and a little bit afterwards, this rich culture which I grew up in has been subject to many changes. Certain things are already gone.
We grew up the traditional way, but theres nothing I can show my grandchildren today. What one would call the typical Jaffna culture has drastically changed. People started to migrate either to avoid the war or because they were in search of greener pastures. But after the war they would come down only for a visit.
So theres no genuine attempt made to preserve their culture. The Tamils who are now living abroad are the third generation. The first generation had an exposure to the Jaffna culture; the second generation had a mix of both.
But this third generation, who was born and bred there, may not have any idea about the culture here. Because of this war, an elaborate museum has never been in our possession.

Q How likely is it for a person from Jaffna to shift to Colombo on a job transfer or a similar opportunity as at now
Its still a challenge and theres a traditional barrier as well. There is inwardness in us, so we dont like to move out. People in Jaffna used to be all over Sri Lanka doing their businesses back in the day. But times have changed now. They have lost their freedom. Im not blaming the Government, but they could do much more. 
Q What role can literature or literary exchanges play in the reconciliation process
There was one exchange programme back in 2004 or 2005 when there was a brief ceasefire. A team of writers came here and we had a full day meeting with poetry recitals and other items. Then a team from Jaffna travelled to Colombo and conducted another programme. The two communities have been drifting apart and if the writers had played a positive role and made peace their priority without fanning the flames of the war, Sri Lanka would have been a great country. We have lost so much and everybody lost. Nobody wins a war. 
Q Whats your message to the younger generation in terms of appreciating literature.
We have to break through these barriers. One big hurdle is the language barrier. I have been an English lecturer for 35-40 years. I dont mind admitting that teaching English to the vast population has been a failure. Ideally I would say that as a Tamil its easier for me to learn Sinhalese than English. For an average Sinhalese its not difficult to learn Tamil as well because theres so much in common in terms of syntax, word order, vocabulary etc. On top of that we share a common culture. Due to the suspicion and animosity of politicians, people look at Sinhala language as an instrument that is being used to oppress them. Sometimes Sinhalese people may also wonder why they need to learn a language of a minority. But my answer would be that if you learn an extra language you will also learn the culture as well, hence you horizons will broaden. In order to unite this country, we need to have a will and purpose in all our hearts.

We all are safe here- Murali
	
The worlds highest wickets taker in Tests, Muttiah Muralitharan says all his family members are safe in Kandy.
Speaking a day after the Sri Lankan government declared a state of emergency, Muralitharan said, Our countrymen are safe everywhere in Sri Lanka. There should be nothing to worry.
Muralitharan now lives in Colombo but his siblings and parents live in Kandy.
Murali, who recently returned to Sri Lanka after spending more than two weeks in India and the UAE, also rightly requested not to sensationalise the present situation in the country in the media.
His wife, Madhi, is presently in India.
The other famous Kandy cricketer is Kumar Sangakkara and he is in the UAE for the Pakistan Super League (PSL) matches and is scheduled to return by the end of this month, by when the emergency would have ended. In the meantime, Kandys Pallekele International Cricket Stadium remained closed on Wednesday.
As per police order the stadium is closed today and we are not aware when would we be allowed to open it. But everything is safe here in Kandy and there is absolutely no problem here, Janaka Pathirana, the cricket chief at Kandy, speaking exclusively to this reporter, said.
In Colombo, everything seemed to be normal and the Bangladesh team have a new motivator Shakib ul-Hasan (he is on a short visit to Colombo and scheduled to leave for Australia on March 8) who had a practice session at the R. Premadasa Stadium. Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) chief Nazmul Hasan Papon and a few directors are scheduled to arrive in Sri Lanka before the teams important match against India on Thursday.
The Bangladeshi team also remained present during the opening ceremony on the first day of the
Nidahas Trophy. (Bipin Dani)

Will control tense situ if given Law and Order Ministry-Range
	
Minister Palitha Range Bandara told Parliament yesterday that he would bring the prevailing tense situation under control if he was given the Law and Order Ministry for two weeks.
Clause 89 to 96 of the penal code gives police the provision to open fire at those violating the law. I heard the Menikhinna Police had opened fire in the air to control the situation. The police should fire at lawbreakers and not at birds in the sky. If police are not aware of the penal code, then it is time they study it. If I were given charge of the police for a fortnight, I will show how to control this tense situation," he said.
On a different note, he said action should be taken against the officials attached to the State Intelligent Service as they have failed in their duty of providing information regarding any impending danger. (Ajith Siriwardana and Yohan Perera)

Wimal: Sinister move to blame JO MPs
	
There was a sinister move to blame two Opposition MPs for the violence in Kandy, Joint Opposition MP Wimal Weerawansa told Parliament yesterday.
"The Government is trying to get away by blaming Opposition MPs Lohan Ratwatte and Dilum Amunugama for the violence in Kandy," MP Weerawansa said.
He charged that the Police have been advised to prepare the reports accordingly.
"The Government is fully aware as to who is behind the violence," he added.
He said concerns were raised by Sinhalese on the sudden changes of Muslim women's attire and the introduction of Arabian culture to Sri Lanka lately.
He said the present Government had done nothing to defuse the tension. (Yohan Perera and Ajith Siriwardana)
