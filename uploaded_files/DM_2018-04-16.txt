SL joins C'wealth Clean Oceans Alliance to end plastic pollution
	
Countries from across the Commonwealth have yesterday pledged to eliminate avoidable single use plastic in an ambitious bid to clean up the worlds oceans.
Prime Minister Theresa May announced that New Zealand, Sri Lanka and Ghana have joined the UK and Vanuatu-led Commonwealth Clean Oceans Alliance  an agreement between member states to join forces in the fight against plastic pollution.
Britain, together with CCOA joint chair Vanuatu, will call on other countries to pledge action on plastics, be this by a ban on microbeads, a commitment to cutting down on single use plastic bags, or other steps to eliminate avoidable plastic waste.
To drive this forward, the Prime Minister has also announced a 61.4 million package of funding to boost global research and help countries across the Commonwealth stop plastic waste from entering the oceans in the first place.
Environment Secretary Michael Gove said:
When it comes to our seas and oceans, the challenge is global so the answer must be too.
Through this ambitious alliance we will build on the UKs world-leading microbeads ban and 5p plastic bag charge to harness the full power of the Commonwealth in pushing for global change and safeguarding our marine environment for future generations.
Developing countries signed up to the Alliance will also be eligible to bid for partnership support to improve waste management systems and implement other initiatives to stop plastic waste from reaching oceans.
In recognition of the passionate response of the UK public to the issue, from later this year the Department for International Development will also match pound-for-pound public donations to tackle the issue of plastic waste in the worlds oceans and rivers.
International Development Secretary Penny Mordaunt said:
The scourge of plastics is a global environmental challenge  and one that overwhelmingly impacts the livelihoods and health of the worlds poorest people.
We are joining forces with our Commonwealth partners, bringing together global expertise to stop plastics waste from entering oceans  and by matching pound-for-pound the UK publics passionate response to the issue, we can make our shared ambition for clean oceans a reality. (gov.uk)

The SLFP ministers, state and deputy ministers, who voted for the no-confidence motion will remain in the yahapalana government to protect and support party leader and President, Maithripala Sirisena, UPFA General Secretary and Minister, Mahinda Amaraweera said today.
He said they were prepared to quit the government if and when the SLFP Central Committee decided they should do so.
I have been extremely disappointed and hurt over the utterances made by those who voted for the no-confidence motion. I wonder whether it was with them that we worked in the unity government and in the same cabinet during the past three years, the minister said when commenting on the derogatory statements made by some of them.
He said the situation had changed dramatically by the morning of April 4, the day of voting when the political parties and MPs were aware of the fate of the no-confidence motion. "The SLFP and joint opposition members knew they did not have the numbers to pass it. The TNA and SLMC had decided to vote against it. That is why on the instructions of the President we decided to keep away. We cant do anything for the loss of cabinet portfolios of those who voted for the motion. It is their own making," he said.
The minister said the SLFP ministers were ready to leave the unity government at any time when the President and the partys Central Committee decides. (Sandun A Jayasekera)

UN demands Maldives to let Nasheed run for office
	
Maldives must restore ex-President Mohamed Nasheeds right to stand for office, including the office of President, the UN Human Rights Committee concluded in a finding made public today.
In a statement, the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights said the finding of violations of human rights was made in response to two individual complaints by Mr. Nasheed filed in 2013 and 2016. 
Mr. Nasheed, first brought to a Maldivian court in 2012, was ultimately charged with terrorism and sentenced to 13 years imprisonment in March 2015. 
As a result, he was disqualified from running in presidential elections for 16 years -- the term of his sentence plus an additional three years.
The UN human rights experts found that the judicial proceedings in which Mr. Nasheed was convicted were based on vague legislation, contained serious flaws and violated his right to a fair trial under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR).
The Committees decision of 4 April, which was made public today, further directs Maldives to quash the authors conviction, review the charges against him taking into account the present Views, and, if appropriate, conduct a new trial ensuring all fair trial guarantees.
As a party to the ICCPR, Maldives is obliged to make full reparation to individuals whose rights have been violated. We have asked Maldives to inform us within 180 days about the measures they have taken to implement our decision, said Mr. Yuval Shany, Vice-Chair of the Human Rights Committee.

US to impose new sanctions on Russia for supporting Syria
	
United States' Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley said Sunday the Trump administration will announce more sanctions against Russia on Monday, the CNN reported.
On CBS's "Face the Nation," Haley has said the Treasury Department will announce the new sanctions and insisted the US has sent "a strong message" about the use of chemical weapons.
You will see that Russian sanctions will be coming down. Secretary Mnuchin will be announcing those on Monday, if he hasn't already, said Haley.
While insisting the action taken early Saturday morning in Syria was a very strong attack on the chemical weapons programme, Haley hit back on more hawkish critics who argue the US didn't go far enough because it did not change the balance of power in the long-running Syrian civil war.
"Our job was never to take Assad out," Haley said, referring to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.
She added that the conflict must ultimately be resolved through a UN-led political process. "Our job was never to start a war."
