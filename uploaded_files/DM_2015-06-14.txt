ICEU demands Bill gazetted to increase pvt sector wages
	
Inter-Company Employees Union (ICEU) today urged President Maithripala Sirisena to take immediate action to gazette the Bill increasing private sector workers wages by Rs. 2500 as promised in the Interim Budget.
ICEU President Wasantha Samarasinghe alleged that several United National Party (UNP) Ministers were trying to disregard by procrastinating the move till the Parliament is dissolved.
He said it was a shame for the UNP-based government that had said the salary of the private sector workers would only be increased by Rs. 1500, and thereby they had broken a pledge given to the people.
Cost of living is skyrocketing and therefore our request is very fair. We demand the government to do this before the Parliament is dissolved, Mr, Samarasinghe said. (Piyumi Fonseka)

MR denies allegations against wife
	
Former president Mahinda Rajapaksa today rejected the charges that his wife, former first lady Shiranthi Rajapaksa had transferred the funds of the Siriliya Saviya Foundation to her private account and purchased a house in Colombo 5 using the money.
"Former president Chandrika Kumaratunga alleged at a news conference that my wife had purchased a house from the funds of the Siriliya Saviya Foundation. This is a baseless allegation. It was my wife's nephew, Dilshan Wickramasinghe who lent her a sum of Rs. 35 million to purchase the said property,"
Rohan Weliwita, media coordinator of Mr. Rajapaksa said that these facts were recorded in both Dilshan Wickramasinghes and Mr.Rajapaksa's income tax returns. He said the property is being used as astorehouse now.
Mr. Rajapaksa had also rejected the claim that two vehicles belonged to the Presidential Secretariet had been deployed to the Siriliya Saviya Foundation. "The said two vehicles were offered by the World Food Organization (WFO) as a gift. They had been left without using because of the excessive taxes imposed by the Customs," he said. (LSP)
