Cabinet approves draft legislation to issue Certificates of Absence
	
The Cabinet of Ministers today approved draft legislation to issue Certificates of Absence, the Foreign Affairs Ministry said.
Issuing a statement, it said the draft legislation which involves an amendment to the Registration of Deaths (Temporary Provisions) Act, No. 19 of 2010 will now be gazetted and the process of presentation to Parliament will commence.
This measure will help tens-of-thousands of Sri Lankans whose family-members and loved ones are missing and who are unable to address practical issues relating to their disappearance, the statement said.
It said Sri Lanka has one of the largest case-loads of missing persons in the world. Since 1994 alone, the Government Commissions have received over 65,000 complaints of missing persons. 
The suffering of the families of those missing is aggravated as the government does not recognize the status of missing persons. This means that the families of missing persons face many issues including inability or difficulty in facilitation of property transfer and ownership, applying for compensation and accessing frozen assets. Although a number of ad hoc measures have been taken in the past, they have failed to address issues faced by the families of the missing, it said.
Certificates of Absence have been used in a number of countries where there are high incidences of missing persons. This practice has been considered as an effective interim measure that balances the psychological and practical needs of family members and loved ones without dismissing the need for active investigation into cases of missing persons.

Ensure UNHRC proposals wont create new conflicts: China
	
Chinese Ambassador in Sri Lanka, Yi Xianliang yesterday had advised Lankan leaders to see that the reconciliation mechanisms suggested by the UNHRC do not create new conflicts, the Indian News Express said.
Addressing the Regional Center for Strategic Studies in Colombo on Monday, he had reiterated that China is against outside interference in domestic affairs.
It would be ill advised to put reconciliation before development because it is only all round equitable development which will prevent social, political and economic conflicts, he said.
Meanwhile, commenting on foreign investments in Sri Lanka, he said the country will have to put its house in order so that there is policy stability, the procedures are simple and there is no overlapping of authority.
Policies should also not change with a regime change, as was the case when the Rajapaksa regime was replaced by the Srisena-Wickremesinghe government, he said. 
Dispelling the notion that China had exceptionally close ties with the Rajapaksa regime, the envoy said that China deals with Lankan state and not with any particular regime.
He also said the common Lankan and Indian perception that Chinese projects are primarily meant to bolster Chinas strategic interests in the region will be dispelled if they are Joint Ventures with local entities and foreign companies and run as commercial enterprises.
The envoy said that mutual antagonism in South Asia will be mitigated if China, India and Pakistan form an economic alliance and co-opt Lanka and other South Asian nations. Lanka and India should sign the Economic and Technical Cooperation Agreement (ETCA), he said and added that he had discussed a China-India-Pakistan-Lanka business link up with the Indian envoy in Colombo and found him to be responsive.

Fire may have erupted while fire drill was on - Def.Sec
	
The fire that erupted at the Salawa Army Camp may have occurred while a fire drill was being carried out in the camp and that may have been the reason for the minimal number of casualties, Defence Secretary Karunasena Hettiarachchi said.
A Court of Inquiry has been set up to inquire into the causes. Therefore, I cant say anything more. Lets wait till the investigations are over, he said at a media briefing held at the Defence Ministry Media Centre and added that action would be taken according to military law against those found responsible for any lapses.
The explosion at the armoury of the Salawa Army Camp resulted in a major fire killing one soldier and injuring several others on June 5.
Mr. Hettiarachchi said the safety of the people would be prioritised.
Those living in the vicinity of the camp will be allowed to return to their homes after making sure that the area is 100 per cent safe. Most of the residents affected by the catastrophe have now returned home," he said.
Mr. Hettiarachchi said the CID and the Army are investigating the cause of the fire and explosions at the Army Camp. (Darshaha Sanjeewa)

For her never would have been better than being late
	
A fair and lovely politician who once announced that she was prepared to sacrifice her life for the well-being of the people in her native place was seen nowhere in her area when it went under flood waters, they say.

About 20 rounds of discussions regarding provision of relief to flood victims and also taking expeditious measures to rehabilitate them had been held at the Divisional Secretariat, but this fair politician had attended none of these meetings.
This fair one keeping a low profile these days had reportedly told her close associates that she had no intention to contest elections in the future.
The lady had paid a visit to her area when the flood waters were receding and the situation was limping back to normal, and the people on seeing her had greeted her with boos.

Govt. taking steps to reduce taxes: Ravi
	
Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake said today the government was taking steps to reduce taxes and that the increase of VAT was to pay back the loans obtained by the Rajapaksa regime.
The VAT was increased to pay back the loans obtained by the Rajapaksa regime. The loans cannot be used to pay back loans that had been obtained. They can be used only for the future development projects. We use these taxes to pay back the loans obtained by the previous regime, he said. 
Minister Karunanayake said the short term target of the government was to stabilize the economy of the country before reducing the taxes.
The economy we were given was full of loans and the statistics had been distorted. Our short term plan is to strengthen the economy before reducing taxes, he said. (Ajith Siriwardana)

Govt. trying to hide cause of Salawa fire: Wimal
	
National Freedom Front (NFF) Leader and MP Wimal Weerawansa today claimed that the government was attempting to hide the cause of the fire in the armory of the Salawa Army Camp.
He said the fire and the resultant destruction of a large stock of weapons which were to be used by the Army for the next 20 years might have been a government attempt to fulfil the requirements of foreign countries.
We should not consider this as an isolated incident. We saw how this government treated our security forces personnel in the recent past. A naval officer and the our Navy were insulted by Eastern Province Chief Minister NazeerAhamed. Soldiers in the Kilinochchi Army Camp were demoralized when Opposition Leader R. Sampanthan forcibly entered the army camp without prior notice or permission. There are clear facts to prove that the Kosgama fire was carried out to reduce the number of weapons based on foreign orders, he claimed.
He said the government was trying to hide the cause of the fire by preventing the Army Intelligence who are more capable of probing the incident, from taking part in the investigations with the CID.
He urged the government to disclose what happened atthe Kosgama Ammunition Dump and protect the other armories as well.
Just because a lighted cigarette fell on the ammunition or the hot weather could not be a reason for such a major catestrophe in the army camp, Mr. Weerawansa said.
He said damage would have been bigger if former defence secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa had not relocated 50% of the ammunition from the Kosgama Camp.
Meanwhile, Mr. Weerawansa said a former security coordinator of the American Embassy in Colombo has been appointed as the Eastern Navy Commander.
The latest appointment was made soon after the transfer of Eastern Navy Commander Rear Admiral Neil Rosayro to Colombo.
Amidst the recent dispute regarding the Eastern Province Chief Ministers public reprimand of a navy officer, Rear Admiral Travis Sinniah was appointed as Commanding Officer of the Eastern province. Rear Admiral Sinniah resigned from the Navy in 2011 citing family reasons. After that, he had been working as the Security Coordinator of the American Embassy in Colombo for four and half years. He has held responsibility for the defence matters of the Pentagon.
However, this government has taken him back to the Navy claiming his resignation was a political revenge and he had been given a Rear Admiral's post with Rs.4.2 million as compensation. How can such an officer be appointed to such a responsible post in the Sri Lanka Navy, Mr. Weerawansa asked.
He claimed that the US was looking at the Trincomalee Habour to establish their naval activities there, appointment of Travis Sinniah who was once the Security Coordinator of the American Embassy would be a favour to them. (Piyumi Fonseka)

The joint opposition said today they would have discussions with ministers, deputy ministers and state ministers of the SLFP to garner their support for the no-confidence motion against Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake to be taken up in Parliament tomorrow.
MP Bandula Gunawardane said the SLFP ministers, deputy ministers and state ministers who promised to safeguard the rights of the people before the election, should support the no-confidence motion if they are really opposed to the people being burdened.
He said Minister Karunanayke has been found to be the most unsuccessful Finance Minister ever and the JO would reveal in parliament how he has burdened the people.
He said the Finance Minister had created a record by obtaining the highest number of foreign loans totaling up to US$ billion 6.6 at the highest rate of interest since independence. (Ajith Siriwardana)

SLMC refuses to register 30 SAITM students
	
The Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) has reportedly refused to register the first batch of 30 medical students, who had passed out from the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM).
The aggrieved students are said to be preparing a petition seeking redress to be filed in the Supreme Court. The SAITM has been functioning amid protests by some medical professionals and students unions of State universities.
When asked for his views on this matter, Higher Education Minister Lakshman Kiriella told Daily Mirror that he hoped the Supreme Court would mete out justice to the students concerned.
He said about 700 students were studying for their medical degrees at SAITM and were anxiously awaiting a ruling from the SC so that this matter would be resolved once and for all.
The minister said SAITM was a degree-awarding institution recognized by the University Grants Commission (UGC).
SAITM students are in this predicament because of the actions of the previous regime. It is now the responsibility of the present government to solve this matter, he said and added that the government encouraged private sector involvement to develop the higher education sector.
That is how other countries have developed. With World Bank assistance, we hope to introduce quality assurance at State Universities and non-State Higher Education Institutions, the minister said. Today, only 17 per cent of Advanced Level students are admitted to State universities. Students who excel in their A/L studies have been denied access to universities because of the prevailing quota system for underprivileged districts. For example, a student who sits the A/L examination in Colombo and obtains distinctions in all subjects may not be eligible to enter a university while a student with lesser qualifications from an underprivileged district enters the university.
