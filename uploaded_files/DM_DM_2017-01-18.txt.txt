A shining example in humility
	

A commemorative ceremony to mark the birth anniversary of the founder-leader of the Blue party was held at his statue on the Galle Face Green the other day.

The eldest daughter of the founder-leader was the first distinguished guest to attend the ceremony.
The organizers of the event who respectfully welcomed the distinguished guest escorted her to the seat in the front row reserved for her. She sat down in the seat after some hesitation. A few minutes later she beckoned an organizer and told him: The President and other VIPs of the government will soon turn up. Therefore, I should not occupy this seat. Arent the seats of the front row really meant for such VIPs
The organizer who was a little surprised protested: Madam, we have got strict instructions to reserve front row seats for the members of the late leaders family. They are the VIPs on this occasion!
She said: No! No! I should not occupy a front row seat. Please offer them to the VIPs of the government who are expected to attend this ceremony.
Waving off the organizers persistent protests, the lady walked off to take a vacant seat at the rear.
Guests at the ceremony who witnessed the incident found it a good topic for discussion and they all agreed that the good lady set a good example for some of our politicos who would create ugly scenes if they were not accommodated in the front row at public functions.

Acid remark sees them disappear
	

A sanghika dana to more than 2,000 bhikkhus was offered at the Presidents House recently to mark Number Ones second anniversary in office and also the birth anniversary of the Blue partys founder-leader.

Number One himself took a hand in serving food to the monks seated in a long line and he suddenly looked back to find a number of political heavyweights following him obviously in a bid to get into the eye of the whirring video cameras instead of serving alms to the monks.
A visibly annoyed Number One aimed a few verbal barbs at the politicos seeking the limelight neglecting their immediate duty which saw most of them disappear fast from the scene, they say.

Cabinet rejects moves to decriminalize homosexuality
	
The Cabinet is reported to have rejected surreptitious attempts buy some to decriminalize homosexuality.
A new provision has been included, under women's rights, in the draft on the Human Rights Action Plan seeking not to discriminate anyone on sexual orientation. Some ministers are reported to have protested at yesterday's Cabinet meeting saying it was yet another surreptitious attempt to recognize homosexuality.
The HR Action Plan was developed through an inter-ministerial process, with the leading role played by the Foreign Affairs Ministry.
It contains proposals to address Sri Lanka's human rights responsibilities under international human rights instruments, on a voluntary basis. The process adopted to evolve the draft ensures that it represents expectations of all segments of Sri Lankan society, in keeping with the mandate received by the National Unity Government to promote good governance, rule of law, democracy, human rights, and reconciliation, and achieve durable peace.

Egyptian court rejects plan to give islands to Saudi Arabia
	

(c) 2017, The Washington Post
by Heba Mahfouz, Kareem Fahim 
CAIRO - A top Egyptian court on Monday overruled a government plan to transfer sovereignty of two Red Sea islands to Saudi Arabia, dealing an embarrassing and unexpected setback to President Abdel Fattah al-Sissi and his attempts to reward financial benefactors in the Persian Gulf region. 
The verdict, by Egypts Supreme Administrative Court, rejected a government appeal of an earlier court ruling and was final, said Khaled Ali, one of the lawyers who challenged the transfer. 
The plan to hand over the uninhabited islands had sparked unusually large protests in Egypt, shocking officials and defying a ban on demonstrations. Many Egyptians saw the possible loss of territory as overreach by an unaccountable government as well as an intolerable attack on identity, with the islands representing, for some, the countrys steady loss of independence and regional clout.
Saudi Arabia and other Gulf nations have propped up Egypts faltering economy with billions of dollars in aid since 2013, when the military, led by Sissi, ousted President Mohamed Morsi, an Islamist leader from the Muslim Brotherhood and the countrys first democratically elected leader. 
During a visit to Egypt by King Salman of Saudi Arabia in April 2016, the government announced it was transferring the two islands, which sit at the mouth of the Gulf of Aqaba and are called Tiran and Sanafir. Officials said that the islands belong to Saudi Arabia and that Egypt had taken control of them in the 1950s, out of concern Israel would seize them. 

The backlash was immediate, with Egyptians criticizing the decision and mocking the government on social media. The fury of the reaction, which included one of the largest demonstrations in years, suggested that the nationalism Sissis government had stoked for several years to shore up its own legitimacy had suddenly backfired: For many, the giveaway of the islands was a red line, whether they belonged to Egypt or not. 
The judges of the administrative court ruled Monday that Egypts sovereignty over the islands was irrevocable. Celebrations broke out in the courtroom when the verdict was read, and outside the court, protesters chanted against Sissi, according to the Egyptian novelist Ahdaf Soueif, who attended the hearing and posted updates on Twitter. 
The chants are: bread freedom social justice, she wrote, and down down with military rule. 
The future of the proposal remains uncertain. Egypts parliament has been debating the transfer of the islands, and the government, separately, has challenged the jurisdiction of the administrative court to rule on the matter. Also left unresolved is the fate of dozens of protesters who were arrested during demonstrations against the transfer of the islands and are facing criminal charges.

Exposing the  hidden story behind Kandaketiya trial
	
On January 9, in a dimly-lit court room of the Badulla High Court, five police officers and a civil defence officer were sentenced to death over the murder of 17-year-old Sandun Malinga from Megahakiula and assault of four others.
Sandun Malinga, a cheerful and optimistic boy, never hesitated to lend a helping hand to anyone in need. Before his tragic end, he had staged a play in the village temple along with his friends. He had big plans for the play in the year to come but he did not live to witness that day dawn.
On May 7, 2014, Sandun was on his way to purchase a trishaw with his brother and three relatives when the foursome were arrested by the Kandaketiya Police. At the police station, they had been tortured severely by a group of drunken policemen and Sandun sustained internal injuries.
The next day, when his parents visited him, Sandun had told them that he was beaten and was not feeling well. Unfortunately, the parents pleas to hospitalise Sandun fell on deaf ears. When Sandun was produced before the magistrate, the lawyer appearing on his behalf informed the magistrate that he had been tortured. His father said he overheard Sandun complain about his plight. However, the complaint was ignored and he was not hospitalised. Instead, he was imprisoned till May 21. At the magistrates chamber, it was disclosed that he had been charged with treasure hunting. However, a statement released later by the Archaeological Department stated that there was no archaeological importance in the area and there had not been any illegal mining.
Prison authorities had promised to direct Sandun to the hospital. However, Sandun had not received any medical treatment till May 9 when he succumbed to his injuries. He had died in the arms of his older brother who had been arrested alongside him in the Badulla prison.
The autopsy carried out by the Judicial Medical Officer of the Badulla Hospital revealed that Sandun had been tortured. His internal organs had been injured as a result of the beating he had to endure.

Negligence
Philip Dissanayake, the Executive Secretary of Right to Life, a human rights organisation which played a pivotal role in pursuing justice for Sandun, said Sanduns death could have been prevented if the District Medical Officer (DMO), magistrate or prison officials had fulfilled their duties.
If he had been hospitalised within the 48 hours leading to his death, he could have been saved and the policemen would not have been sentenced to death. This shows the shortcomings in the mechanism in executing the law, he said addressing a press conference.
A DMO should submit a report after inspecting the suspect. But the DMO of the Kandaketiya Hospital had asked for the name and address of Sanduns brother, but had not inquired anything from the other suspects. Hence, he has not fulfilled his job, he added.
Right to Life has written to the Medical Council on the role played by the DMO over the death of the youth. However, Mr. Dissanayake charged that there was no investigation conducted.
We wrote to the IGP, the police commission, prisons commissioner and the prison reforms minister at the time to take action against the officer in-charge and other police officers attached to the Kandaketiya police station, he noted.
In 2011, the UN committee against torture recommended that all suspects directed to the magistrate should be questioned as to whether they had been tortured. The government has promised to execute this proposal. But this magistrate did not act according to it, he said.
Accordingly, a letter was sent to the Judicial Service Commission over the non-fulfilment of duty by the magistrate. But Dissanayake charged that there had not been an investigation yet.

Justice Delivered Forthwith
The verdict sentencing R.M.P. Somarathna (SI), D. M. Aberathna (PC), D. P. P. Gamage (PC), L. C. G. Silva (PC), S. M. Pushpa Kumara (PC), D. M. Wijerathna (Police Assistant) and S. M. Jayasundara (Civil Defence Force) was delivered on January 9.
Though we cannot retrieve Sanduns life, we were able to achieve justice. This verdict could be perceived as a positive sign of the supremacy of law and justice, said Dissanayake.
Laws delay is prominent when it comes to criminal cases and usually they drag on for 10 years or more. Sarath Nanda Silva, the former Chief Justice, prior to leaving office said 94% of cases filed under criminal charges were dismissed as they couldnt be taken forward or because defendants were released. Against such a backdrop, this verdict given within two and a half years looks promising, he said.
Writ Mandamus filed
Mr. Dissanayake pointed out that the Attorney General (AG) should have filed a case under the Torture Act No. 22 of 1994 as Sandun died as a result of being tortured. Therefore, he said that for the first time his organisation attempted to file a writ of Mandamus against the AG.
When a government official has not fulfilled his duty, we are able to file a writ of Mandamus. The case was accepted but finally the Court of Appeal informed us that since a criminal case had been filed, there was a difficulty in permitting it, he said.
He added that though the Torture Act was ratified in 1994, cases were filed under the act only during the early part of the 21st century. However, he said it seemed as if there were no cases filed against this Act after 2006. Hence, he added that their effort was mainly to file cases under the Torture Act where such incidents occurred.
Substantiating his claim that the change in government had brought about reforms, he cited the independent commissions, National Police Commission and the Human Rights Commission established through the 19th Amendment.
There has been a relative decrease in the influence made on the Judiciary and the police. We believe this verdict is a result of these changes, he added.

Justice Served Rightly
Amidst tears, Kanda Udagedara Mallika, the mother of Sandun, said though she had lost her son forever, she was saddened to hear the six police personnel being sentenced to death.
Family members of the six cops were present that day and they wailed when the verdict was read out. There were around 30 family members including small children. Though my son was killed, I am heartbroken because six families will become destitute. Now, the culprits must be regretting their actions, she said.
Expressing gratitude to Right to Life for joining them in the bi-monthly case hearings, she also thanked the OIC and other police officers attached to the Badulla Police for supporting them and not siding withthe perpetrators.
My son pointed out three cops who had severely tortured him. We expected punishment for those three police officers and we thought the other three would escape taking advantage of a loophole. But justice was served rightly and they were all condemned to death,
she said.
Sandun had been the strength of their family and helped them in all household chores.
He sold vegetables and spices with me at the Meegahakiula market, the still grieving mother said.
Meanwhile, Gamini Priyantha, the father of Sandun, told Daily Mirror that he received death threats from Police Assistant D.M. Wijeratne. Fearing for their safety, they have moved to Galle. Recollecting fond memories of his son, he said he was economical and did not waste a cent.

Police Torture
As Nandana Weeraratne, the producer of the short documentary portraying the plight of Sandun Malinga commented, Sandun is neither the first nor the last to die in a prison as a result of police torture. Sanduns story remains a powerful testimony to the plight of countless victims who underwent injustice at the hands of the powerful, negligent and irresponsible.

GMOA wants Rajitha to intervene in implementing directives
	
The Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) today urged Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne to intervene in the implementation of the directives on annual transfers of government doctors.
GMOA Media Spokesman Dr. Samantha Ananda told a news conference that a certain director who had been removed from the transfer board was sabotaging the annual transfers of government doctors.
The Health Minister had removed this individual from the transfer board some time ago. But as a result of his continuous intervention to this process, all annual transfers have being delayed for a long period of time, Dr. Ananda said, adding that it was however questionable as to how this individual could act against the recommendations of the Health Minister.
An inquiry is ongoing regarding this director over several issues. The annual transfers for government doctors have been continually disrupted since 2012 due to an administrative lapse. All government medical officers attached to the Health Ministry are subjected to the transfer system, he said.
Dr. Ananda added that the GMOA would be forced to resort to trade union action if the authorities failed to resolve these serious concerns. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)

Katy Perrys chilling PSA against  creating a database of Muslims in the country
	

By Kristine Guerra 
(c) 2017, The Washington Post  
The video opens with the story of 89-year-old Naru Kuromiya, a Japanese-American who spent her childhood on a chicken farm in Riverside, California. 
Sitting on a chair, with a shawl covering her small frame, Kuromiya talks about that fateful day in 1942, when government officials took her father. They were given tags and numbers to wear, she said. Then, they were placed on a train, and Kuromiya, who would have been in her teens then, found herself living in an internment camp. 
We had to leave our business, our homes and our possessions behind, even our pets, she said. We were an American farm family now living in an internment camp. And our constitutional rights were taken away from us. It all started with fear and rumours, then it bloomed into the registration of Japanese-Americans. 
Then, the twist. 
About a minute and a half into the video, Kuromiya stops talking. For a few seconds, she stares directly at the camera. She takes off her glasses and her wig. Nothing can be heard except the sound of a piano. 
Then, she slowly peels off her prosthetic mask, revealing a young woman with black hair and dark eyes underneath the disguise.

Dont let history repeat itself, she said. 
The young woman is played by Hina Khan, a Los Angeles-based Muslim actress of Pakistani heritage, according to the Los Angeles Times. 
#DontNormalizeHate, a nearly three-minute PSA produced by singer Katy Perry, draws parallels between the incarceration of 120,000 Japanese-Americans during World War II and the anti-Muslim rhetoric of not only President-elect Donald Trump, but also of his advisers and picks for Cabinet members. 
Perry, a Hillary Clinton supporter, is among the celebrities who will attend the Womens March in Washington on Saturday, the day after Trumps inauguration. Other attendees are America Ferrera, Cher, Scarlett Johansson, Amy Schumer, Olivia Wildem Constance Wu, Zandaya and Orange is the New Black star Uzo Aduba. 
Trump had proposed a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States. After it was criticized by Republicans and Democrats, Trumps campaign amended it, saying immigration should be suspended from countries compromised by terrorism. 
But in December, Trump suggested that hes standing by the proposal he talked about on the campaign trail in 2015. Trump has made only vague statements to the media about the possibility of creating a database of Muslims in the United States. Those statements also dont draw a distinction between a database of all Muslims in the country, or a registry of just Muslim immigrants. 
On Nov. 19, 2015, for instance, a Yahoo News reporter asked the then-Republican front-runner about registering Muslims in a database or noting their religion on IDs. Trump said, Were going to have to look a lot of things very closely. Were going to have to look at the mosques. Were going to have to look very, very carefully. 
When NBC News asked him again the following day, Trump said he would certainly implement a database of Muslims in the country. 
There should be a lot of systems, beyond databases. We should have a lot of systems, he told NBC News. 
When asked if Muslims would be required to sign into the database, he said, They have to be - they have to be. 
Shortly after, Trump disputed reports that he had endorsed creating a database for Muslims. 
In December, his campaign released a statement staying, President-elect Trump has never advocated for any registry or system that tracks individuals based on their religion, and to imply otherwise is completely false. 
The president-elects choices for attorney general, CIA director and national security adviser also raised fears from Muslim civil rights groups and current and former government officials that the appointments could reinforce perceptions that the United States is at war against Islam itself, The Washington Posts Joby Warrick and Abigail Hauslohner wrote. 
Trump has created an atmosphere of fear for Muslims Americans in the United States, Aya Tanimura, the PSAs co-director, told the Los Angeles Times. The accountability and responsibility for what you say and do now has been lifted so people feel a little freer to be racist, or act upon racism, because there are not necessarily consequences for it - its just acceptable behaviour. If laws are put in place to back that up, it will be pretty scary. 
The PSA, which was posted on YouTube Wednesday, was co-directed by Los Angeles-based filmmakers Tanimura and Tim Nackashi. Tanimura said casting a Muslim actress for the film was nonnegotiable, according to the Los Angeles Times. 
Tanimura and Nackashi were not immediately available for comment Sunday.

New leasing scheme for vehicles based on loan to value ratio, which was proposed in the 2017 budget, came into effect from today, the Finance Ministry said.
It was proposed in the budget that the loan to value ratio should be 25% for three wheelers, 50% for motor cars and vans and 90% for lorries and buses.
Relevant Acts and regulations were introduced as a move to implement a simplified tax system with effect from April 01.
The new regulations, with regard to lease for vehicles are not being applicable to transport service providers and those in the tourism sector. They will be able to enjoy 100% lease out for vehicles.
At the same time, university scholars who conducted researches said that a body to regulate three wheelers was needed.
Budget 2017, which welcomed the argument by university experts has proposed new regulations in leasing out three wheelers and therefore the Central Bank has advised commercial banks and leasing companies to follow new regulations in granting loans for vehicle leasing, including three wheelers.
Earlier, loans can be borrowed after paying 10% of the total value of a three wheeler, which a borrower intended to buy. In the future, under the new leasing regulations, 25% of the total value of a three wheeler should be paid as down payment.
Proposed traffic laws and spot fines are also scheduled to be revised in the near future and the Finance Ministry believes that the new regulations imposed on loans will make an impact on leasing out of three wheelers.
Treasury Secretary R.H.S. Samaratunga had informed Secretaries of all line Ministries to take necessary actions to implement all development proposals made in the Budget for each Ministry.
These proposals in the budget, which have already been passed by Parliament, will be implemented through relevant Ministries and their affiliate institutions. (Chaturanga Pradeep)

New tie-up puts JO on tenterhooks
	

All indications are that the Hambantota Industrial Zone (HIZ) project has run into serious trouble with the JO dead set to upset the apple cart.

However, the second in command in yahapalanaya who has set his heart on this project appears determined to go ahead with it come hell or high water. Having got around the elder sibling  the former Diyawanna chair to support the project, the other day he took the soft-spoken elderly politico along with him on a visit to all Buddhist temples in Ruhuna in a bid to win over the Maha Sangha.
The militants in the JO camp had gone into a flutter on hearing about the elder siblings new tie-up with the second in command and had complained about the new development to their mentor, the former strongman: Sir, when they are battering us, he is getting pally with them
However, the former strongman had expressed his reluctance to intervene in the matter out of his respect of the elder sibling.
Nevertheless, the JO militants had kept mounting pressure on the former strongman who had finally pacified them by sending a message to his elder sibling, they say.

Prelates to preach to uniformed top brass
	

The prelates of the two leading Buddhist temples in Kandy have received several complaints against the uniformed top brass regarding the shabby treatment meted out to the monks who spearheaded the recent protest in Hambantota.

A video footage showing a uniformed bigwig issuing specific instructions as to how the monks participating in the protest should be handled had accompanied one of these complaints. The highly perturbed prelates had later brought this matter to attention of the highest echelons in yahapalanaya.
Meanwhile, the two prelates have decided to summon the uniformed bigwig to Kandy to tell him how the uniformed ones should treat the Maha Sangha, they say.

Ratifying 27 intl conventions the criteria for GSP+: EU
	
The European Union (EU) said today the ratification and implementation of 27 international conventions signed by the Sri Lankan Government was the only criteria to be considered when assessing Sri Lanka's application to re-gain the GSP+ facility.
Issuing a statement, the EU said these conventions were related to international human rights, labour rights, environmental standards and good governance.
Benefitting from GSP+ requires the government to undertake to make further progress in implementing the conventions and to cooperate with us to monitor implementation and address shortcomings, the EU said.
The EU said they have supported the leadership shown by the government in committing to address historic and long-standing problems that have caused conflict and negatively affected the lives and living standards of all Sri Lankans.
This includes the undertakings made, for instance, in the resolution that Sri Lanka co-sponsored at the UN Human Rights Council, the EU stressed.
The EU said they have being working with the government and civil society organisations to structure their support and engagement to positively contribute to the government's national reconciliation and good governance aims.
Currently there are 8 GSP+ recipients including Armenia, Bolivia, Cape Verde, Kyrgyzstan, Mongolia, Pakistan, Paraguay and Peru.

Regulatory authority for three-wheelers and school vans
	
In order to upgrade the service quality of the passenger transportation in three-wheelers and student transportation in school vans, the Cabinet on Tuesday has approved to establish a regulatory authority, Cabinet spokesman, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said today.
The establishment of a regulatory authority for three-wheelers and school vans is a 2017 Budget proposal.
The setting up of the regulatory authority will be done on the consultation of various ministers, institutes and on certain subjects from Provincial Councils. A study should be done with attention on taking relevant measures as well as on responsibility, role, and formulating the mechanism.
Therefore, it was also decided to appoint a committee comprising Secretaries of the Ministry of Transport and Civil Aviation, Local Government and Provincial Councils, Justice, Law & Order and Southern Development, Megapolis and Western Development, Higher Education and Highway, Education, Finance and Health to report regarding the relevant matters to the Cabinet of Ministers within 02 months.

SL will integrate trade in Asian region: PM
	
Sri Lanka is slated to play a significant role in integrating trade in the Asian region through a number of trade ties which are to be signed, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said yesterday.
He made this remark at a media briefing held in line with the World Economic Forum in Davos last evening.
Sri Lanka will tie up with nations such as India, Bangladesh and Vietnam, and thereby bring the Indian Ocean states together and then go in for trade ties with Japan and whole of ASEAN and thus play a role in integrating trade in Asia, he said.
Mr. Wickremesinghe elaborating on the trade agreements which are being lined up said Sri Lanka will go in for separate trade arrangements with five Southern states in India, including Tamil Nadu. Sri Lanka will also go in for a trade pact with Bangaladesh, Vietnam and other Indian Ocean states, he said, In addition he said Sri Lanka would be looking at going in for a trade agreement with ASEAN rather than separate trade pacts with its member states. We will also have trade ties with Japan, he said.
He said the government would come up with a tax incentive plan in March this year.
We hope to complete the negotiations with India, China and Singapore by June this year, said Minister of Development Policies and International Trade Malik Samarawickrama at the briefing.
We expect the existing investors to expand their investments and expect new investors as well, he added. He said the government also expected the Sri Lankan Diaspora to invest.
Mr. Samarawickrama describing the progress made in infrastructure facilities development, said The Southern Highway extension up to Hambantota and the Central Expressway would be commissioned within the next two and a half years.
Minister of Finance Ravi Karunanayake said Sri Lanka cannot depend on a 23 million population but should venture into the foreign markets. The perilous economy which we inherited from the previous regime has been brought somewhat under control, he said.
Minister of Digital Infrastructure Development Harin Fernando said the government would be stepping into an endeavour to introduce an overall digital payment platform this year, while focusing on digital technology education and developing other digital infrastructural facilities. (Yohan Perera)

The Zika virus just quietly spread to West Africa
	

By Robbie Gramer
(c) 2016, Foreign Policy   
One might have thought that 2016 closed the door on the terrible Zika virus. But just weeks into a new year, Zika has reared its ugly head - this time in southwest Africa. 
On Wednesday, Angola announced its first two cases of the virus. Its doubly bad news for a country that is still recovering from both a cholera and a yellow fever epidemic that has killed hundreds. The two cases may not yet be cause for concern, but theyre an ominous reminder of how ripe the region could be for a widespread Zika outbreak. 
Up until two months ago, we didnt have any detected case, but, now, we have two cases of Zika, Health Minister Jos Luis Gomes Sambo said on Wednesday. We have to take preventable measures, especially in the anti-vectorial fight against the mosquitoes, he added. 
One case was reportedly a French citizen on travel, while the other is a 14 year-old in the Angolan capital Luanda, World Health Organization (WHO) regional emergency director Soc Fall told Foreign Policy. 
Even though its just two cases, health officials arent taking any chances. Fall said the WHO is working closely with Angolas government to monitor the patient and investigate any new suspected Zika cases. After West Africas Ebola outbreak in 2014, international health experts are on edge. We didnt wait to react, Fall said. 
And for good reason. Luanda, with a dense population and poor infrastructure, is a ripe breeding ground for disease outbreaks, said New Americas Donna Patterson. 
From there, the virus could spread like wildfire if uncontained. 
This [Zika] strain seems to be much more virulent than ones weve seen in the past, Patterson told FP. And if it turns from two cases to 20 or more rapidly, we know we have real cause for concern for Angola. 
A study in September 2016 found that over 2 billion people in Asia and Africa could be at risk of contracting the Zika virus in Asia and Africa, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa and southeast Asia. Many countries in the region have weak health systems, including Angola, Fall said. That makes it hard for developing countries to respond to outbreaks in time. 
Angola has already learned that lesson the hard way. On Tuesday, the ministry of health said 106 people have died in a cholera outbreak since December. And a yellow fever epidemic killed 400 three months ago. (The yellow fever outbreak jarred the international community so badly that the WHO led a campaign to vaccinate over 12 million people in Angola and neighbouring Democratic Republic of Congo last year). 
And disease isnt the only struggle Angolas beleaguered health sector faces. It also has steep funding problems. In March last year, Angola gutted public spending after laggard global oil prices stifled its economic growth (Angola, one of Africas largest petro-states, relies on oil for 95 percent of its government revenue). The spending cuts targeted vital government services like water sanitation, sewage, and health, which likely exacerbated the disease outbreaks. 
In September 2016, the WHO declared an end to the global Zika emergency, though emphasized the virus remained a threat. 
Before the new Angola cases, 69 countries and territories around the world reported cases of the Zika virus since the outbreak started in 2015, the WHO says, with most reported cases in Central and South America.

Two from the top team put in the dock
	

Number One in Yahapalanaya held a powwow with the front-liners of the Betel leaf party at his official residence recently.

At the outset, two party stalwarts  a vociferous young top team member from Wayamba and an equally vociferous spokesman from Uva - made a request that they be allowed to make some important revelations. And the Number One immediately gave way to them. 
The duo had then begun making serious allegations against two top team members who, they charged were undermining the unity government by resorting to self-seeking nefarious activities.
Asked whom they were driving at, the two stalwarts had named the two top team members they put in the dock and proceeded to describe their charges against them. Of the two top team members who had come under the vociferous duos fire is from the upcountry and the other is from the Colombo district, they say.
After giving an attentive ear to the litany of charges made against the two top team members, Number One had confided in those present the action he proposed to take against the two top team members. As the Betel leaf bigwigs had vowed to guard as a secret what Number One confided in them, they refused to divulge it to us.
As to what action Number One proposes to take against the two top team members facing serious charges  your guess is as good as mine!

Unitary character and devolution: Decision upto Parliament: Kiriella
	
While stating that no decision had been made in the constitutional process regarding the unitary character or devolution of power, Leader of the House and the member of the Constitution Steering Committee Lakshman Kiriella said today the final decision on these matters will be made by Parliament.
Minister Kiriella told a media briefing that the steering committee had not come up with any proposal yet. The steering committee of the constitutional assembly has not prepared a draft constitution yet. What we have before us is the reports of seven sub committees, the Minister said.
The subcommittee reports will be openly debated in Parliament and thereby reject some and accept others and the final draft will be prepared by the House, he added.
Accordingly, the Minister said no decision has been made on the unitary status or devolution of power.
Also he said some have proposed that the power of provincial governors has to be increased while others have proposed that it should be reduced. However all of these decisions will be made by Parliament, he said.
However, he said what the present government intends doing is to fulfil the pledge given by Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa who once said he will accept any solution to the national issue proposal submitted by a parliamentary select committee. The Minister recalled that the former President had pledged for a solution which goes beyond the 13th Amendment to the Constitution.
What we are trying to do is to fulfil what the former President had once proposed and he himself and his supporters are opposing the same today, Mr Kiriella said.(Yohan Perera)
