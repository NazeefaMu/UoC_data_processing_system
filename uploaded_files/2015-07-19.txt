Ex-CJ's argument rubbished by Justice Minister
	
	The United National Party (UNP) today rubbished the argument proffered by ex-chief justice Sarath N. Silva and other UPFA members that under the 19th Amendment, the President did not have the authority to appoint a prime minister.
	He said on Friday that the President had no say in selecting a prime minister other than appointing as PM a member who commanded the majority support in parliament.
	UNP Colombo District Candidate and Justice Minister Wijedasa Rajapakshe told a media briefing that under 19A the President had the authority to appoint anyone whom he thought would be able to win the confidence of a majority of members in parliament.
	He said the ex-CJ was double-talking and behaving in a duplicitous manner.
	The minister hit back at the ex-CJ that during the presidential election he came out with an entirely different opinion when on several occasions he very clearly stated that the then president Mahinda Rajapaksa had to be thrown out of power. The minister also recalled that the ex-CJ Silva had tendered a public apology for having given an incorrect judgement in the 'Helping Hambantota Case' in which the ex-president was charged with committing a financial fraud.
	The minister said that similarly all the other judgments given by Sarath N. Silva during his tenure as chief justice were questionable when considering the apology he made on the 'Helping Hambantota' scam. (Yohan Perera and Dayana Udayangani)

Four SL refugees released
	
Four Sri Lankan refugees lodged in a special camp at the Tiruchi Central Prison, India were released yesterday, The Hindu reported.
V.M.P. Nehru alias Eezha Nehru, K. Ramanan alias Thanigaivendhan, N. Ramesh and Y. Palani alias Jegan were lodged in the camp for violating provisions of the Foreigners Act. They were among the 19 refugees lodged in the camp for allegedly committing various offences. They were released based on an order issued by the State government on July 7.
While thanking the State government for releasing them, Nehru said it was made possible due to a series of agitations undertaken by them in the special camp.
Several other refugees were still languishing in special camps. Some of them were facing serious health problems and the others were undergoing mental agony. Hence, the government should issue order to release all of them.
There were reports that the State had taken a decision not to invoke the Foreigners Act against Sri Lankan refugees. It should be implemented, he said.

UNFGG will create cluster villages- Ranil
	
The United National Front for Good Governance (UNFGG), if elected, would set up a cluster village system in Sri Lanka by putting several villages together and decentralise power to these new units, said Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe over the weekend.
Addressing an election rally in Maho, the prime minister said the cluster village system would be set up under the ?Gamata Ratak' (a country for a village) programme which had been planned by the UNFGG.
He added that these cluster villages would be governed by a committee comprising representatives of the villagers. He added that the public servants would be responsible to the cluster village committees concerning affairs pertaining to the villages.
He said each cluster village would have a modern market place with facilities to store and sell the agricultural products and a business centre.
Referring to the raging kidney disease, he said a UNFGG government would ensure that at least 1000 dialysis machines would be in operation in the hospitals of the affected areas.
Making more promises, he said all those who had no deeds for their lands would be given deeds.
He also promised to set up economic development zones which would generate employment opportunities. (Yohan Perera)
