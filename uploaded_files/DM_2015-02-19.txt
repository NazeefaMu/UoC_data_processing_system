Probe on national carrier
	
	The four-member committee appointed to look into the alleged misdemeanors and mismanagement by the former management of the national carrier SriLankan has been directed to submit its report by March 30 for quick remedial action, Daily Mirror learns.
	The Committee appointed by Ports and Aviation Minister Arjuna Ranatunga will be headed by good governance and human rights activist and senior lawyer J.C. Weliamuna and comprise U.H. Palihakkara, B.A.W. Abeywardana and M.K. Bandara has its other members.
	The Committee has been mandated to investigate whether the national carriers previous senior management had abused their powers during their term of office, whether any irregularities had taken place in the leasing or procurement of aircraft, whether due processes were followed in the procurement of aircraft and the purchasing of goods and equipment and whether any outside pressure or intimidation has been exerted resulting in undermining the smooth functioning of the airline.
	An interim report has to be submitted before March 15 and the final report on or before March 30.
	The SriLankan airlines had plans to replace its entire fleet by 2020 at a cost of US$1.5 billion (or some Rs.930 billion) with new aircraft from Air Bus Industries in France.
	The transaction will be carried out through an international leasing company acting as guarantor to both parties.
	A source, on the condition of anonymity, told Daily Mirror that 13 aircraft comprising A320, A330 and A340 air buses are to be delivered by the Air Bus Industries at a list price of US$1.5 billion by 2020 in line with the agreement signed between the aircraft manufacturer and SriLankan airlines on a staggered basis.
	Seven brand new A350 wide-bodied aircraft are scheduled to be delivered in mid-2016 with the final air bus to be delivered by 2020, he added.
	The objective of modernizing the fleet of aircraft was to lessen the heavy losses incurred by SriLankan airlines resulting from the mounting maintenance costs of the aging fleet.
	The source said Sri Lanka expected to host some 2.5 million tourists by 2020 and the target would not be met if the fleet of aircraft remained obsolete and ground handling inefficient and as such in addition to purchasing new aircraft, the Civil Aviation Ministry hoped to build another terminal adjoining the one at the Bandaranaike International Airport.
	He said the new terminal to be constructed at an estimated cost of 28 billion yen (or Rs.35 billion) will be funded by JAICA and will have the capacity to handle nine million travellers annually once completed by the end of 2016 in addition to the six million passengers handled by the current terminus.

Gunaratnam awaits citizenship decision: FSP
	
	The Frontline Socialist Party (FSP) today said that its leader Kumar Gunaratnam will not leave the country until the authorities declare their decision regarding the citizenship application he submitted earlier this month.
	FSP Politburo member Pubudu Jagoda told the Daily Mirror although the Supreme Court suspension on the deportation order against Gunaratnam expired on Wednesday (18), the FSP leader would not be leaving the country until a decision was issued regarding the citizenship application he submitted to the Immigration and Emigration Department on February 5.
	"Kumar's deportation issue is not a legal dilemma but a political issue - it cannot be solved within legal grounds," Pubudu said.
	He pointed to the Fundamental Rights petition filed by Gunaratnam, which was rejected by the Supreme Courts yesterday and said it was not heard mainly due to the Court not being entitled to decide on matters pertaining to citizenship or the extension of visa.
	"The sole authority lies with the Minister in charge of the subject - in this case Public Order Minister John Amaratunga and the cabinet, he said.
	"If his application is rejected, that again would be another issue because when the current Central Bank Governor Arjuna Mahendran arrived in the country to assume duties in his post, he had been granted citizenship within a matter of a day. So why adopt double standards" Jagoda questioned. 
	However, Immigration and Emigration Controller Nihal Ranasinghe had said that Gunaratnam would be deported from the country by today.
	Jagoda said a debate was due to be taken up in parliament today concerning Gunaratnam's deportation issue. (Lakna Paranamanna)

Customs introduces new door-to door service
	
	Sri Lanka Customs hopes to develop a new proactive, door-to-door delivery service attached to Customs Clearance Department as a means of reducing the high cost incurred by importers and easing their logistical problems, Customs Director General Jagath P. Wijeweera said.
	This new door-to-door delivery service mainly focuses on delivering the goods that arrive at the port through a registered delivery service direct to the importer with minimum effort.
	We have invited several private companies to install goods scanners and to implement a system to monitor the action of the scanners at the Customs office or at the service provider or even from another location, Mr. Wijeweera said.
	He said the next step would be to set up a network and link up with the Immigration and Emigration Department to maintain a record of arrivals and the goods they bring into the country.
	With this facility in place it is going to be make customs clearance uncomplicated and easy. As a result the need to individually check and pass the goods entering the country will not exist in the future, thus saving time and money, Mr. Wijeweera said and added that goods brought into the country without a passport would be cleared without taxes and goods which do not exceed Rs.15,000 would be excluded from taxes and released by Customs.
	The Customs Department hopes that several companies will agree to install these scanners in the next few months. (Chaturanga Pradeep)

IRCON may bid for highways projects in SL
	
	The Indian Railways construction subsidiary IRCON International is poised to bid for highways construction projects in Sri Lanka breaking into an area which, during the previous regime of Mahinda Rajapaksa, seemed to be earmarked for Chinese companies.
	An IRCON official told Express that the company had Indian and overseas experience in highways construction and will be quite happy to bid for projects in Lanka in the light of a recent cabinet decision to discuss Indian participation in highways development in the island nation.
	The cabinet had approved a proposal by Highways Minister, Kabir Hashim, to explore the possibility of entering into agreements with Indian agencies to execute road construction projects and signing MoUs during the visit of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi to Lanka in March.
	Delineating the possibilities in highway development, Deputy Minister of Highways Eran Wickramaratne said that the government is reviewing all the Chinese aided projects and those which do not measure up to the desired norms will be put up for fresh bidding. To begin with the axe has fallen on the Northern Highway projects (between Colombo and Kandy and Colombo and Dambulla).
	Any party, whether local or foreign, can bid. Our criteria will be expertise, experience and ability to bring in finances, Wickramaratne said.
	This is in marked contrast to the situation under the Mahinda Rajapaksa regime when many of the major Chinese aided projects had been handed out without going for competitive bidding. 
	The Chinese executed projects have received flak for being grossly overpriced. According to Dr. Amal S.Kumarage, Professor of Transport at the Moratuwa University, the accepted global norm is to charge US$ 7 million to 10 million per kilometer. But in Lanka, the price ranges from US$ 19 million to US$ 172 million per km. In India, the Mumbai-Nashik highway cost only US$ 4.9 million per km and the Mumbai-Vadodra highway was even less, at US$ 2.9 million per km.
	Given IRCONs good track record in railway construction in Lanka (IRCONs lines are much cheaper than the Chinese ones), the Indian company should be able to put forth a competitive bid for the highway projects too. (Indian Express)

Fishermen associations to join Modi, Sirisena
	
	NEW DELHI: Fishermen associations of India and Sri Lanka will meet on March 6 in Colombo to thrash out a formula to end the dispute over fishing boats from Tamil Nadu encroaching into Lankan waters. The meeting follows discussions between heads of governments of the two nations.
	President Maithripala Sirisena discussed with PM Narendra Modi the long-standing issue and its adverse impact when they met in New Delhi on Monday. Modi and Sirisena discussed the reconciliation efforts undertaken by the new Lankan government for the Tamils, official sources said.
	Sirisena raised the issue of fishermen from TN bottom-trawling in Sri Lankan waters and destroying the island's coral beauty and ocean wealth.
	Giving a presentation, Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne who accompanied the president, claimed the methods adopted by TN fishermen posed a grave danger to the island and hurt the livelihood of its fishermen.
	A senior Lankan official alleged that Colombo had brought these issues to the attention of the previous governments in New Delhi, which failed to act. Modi has realised that this was a serious matter and urgent resolution was necessary, the official informed. Addressing the joint press briefing with Sirisena, Modi said, "we will encourage fishermen's associations on both sides to meet again soon. They should find a solution that can be taken forward by both governments."
	Official sources said the fishermen associations are expected to meet in Colombo on March 6 ahead of Modi's visit to the Lankan capital and Jaffna in mid-March. A formula that the two sides could explore is that TN fishermen have fishing rights for one week in the waters dividing India and Lanka and their Lankan counterparts similar rights for another full week, sources indicated. The two sides are also exploring drawing a boundary in the seas through balloons or similar material. An announcement for the lasting resolution of the issue could be made when Modi visits Colombo next month.
	Government officials said India appreciated Sirisena government's 100-day programme, particularly those involving measures to reach out to Tamil minorities. Modi has lauded measures like appointing eminent civilians as Governors of the Northern and Eastern Provinces in place of military commanders, and deciding to return one thousand acres now under the Army's control to its owners in the northern part of Jaffna peninsula, among other things. Modi could announce additional measures for the Tamils when he visits Jaffna. (Indian Express)

Video: New DG of Bribery Commission promises tough action
	
	The newly elected Director General of the Commission to Investigate Complaints of Bribery or Corruption, Dilrukshi Wickramasinghe, today said that she had put forward an idea of having a separate court to hear such cases related to bribery and corruption because of the sheer number of complaints that the Commission had received.
	She said they had held discussions with the Justice Minister in this regard among others related to the Commission when the minister visited the commission last morning. We are also short of 48 cadres for the Investigation Department among other vacancies that exist. We were assured that we will be given new officers but deploying new officers and utilizing them is the main challenge we face, Ms. Wickramasinghe told a news conference today.
	While stressing the need to safeguard the independent nature of the Commission, she vowed to have zero tolerance towards corruption. She said she would topple the corruption tree in the island with the support of everyone, though it might take a long time to achieve the goal. Our duty is to create a culture where there is a zero tolerance towards bribery and corruption. I repeat zero tolerance, she re-iterated.
	Ms. Wickramasinghe said they were going through about 1,600 complaints at the moment and that a majority of cases had been referred for investigation. She assured that each and every complaint would be looked into and referred to the relevant department. We will not set a case aside just because it was against a legislator. We will go through all the cases separately. However, we have received a considerable amount of complaints which are not under the purview of the Commission. I must also warn those who make false accusations against people that the commission recently lodged indictment charges against three persons for making false complaints, she said.
	Meanwhile, she stressed the importance of putting the Commission in order before looking into the accusations of others. People can complaint on the number 076-7011954 or the e-mail address- dgbribery@gmail.com if they have any evidence against the Commissions officials, she said.(Lahiru Pothmulla and Sanath Desmond)

	The newly appointed Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) National Organiser Susil Premajayantha said Wednesdays Nugegoda rally was a success and it reflected the power of the betel leaf.
	
	He expressed these views at a news conference held at the SLFP head office soon after assuming duties as national organiser. The new SLFP Treasurer S.B. Navinna also assumed duties at the SLFP head office.
	When a journalist asked whether the Nugegoda rally, organised by four political parties of the United Peoples Freedom Alliance (UPFA) was successful, Mr. Premajayantha said, Why not.
	He said the SLFP had some issues about participating at the rally because there were no discussions held with the organisers of the rally.
	We would have arrived at a decision if they had consulted us before organising the rally. But what we received was an open invitation afterwards, he said adding that there was no need to take action against SLFP members who took part in the rally. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

Rs. 1.21 crore bid for Modi's pinstripe suit
	
	Prime Minister Narendra Modi's pinstripe monogrammed bandhgala suit, which hogged limelight during President Barack Obama's visit, went up for auction in the diamond city on Wednesday.
	On the first of the three-day auction, Rajesh Juneja from Surat bid a whopping Rs 1.21 crore for Modi's Navy blue suit. Juneja gave a written bid offering Rs 1.21 crore for the suit which was the star attraction at the auction.
	Juneja, who emerged as the highest bidder for the suit on day one, told a news agency,"I like Modi's hardwork, confidence and that is why he is my role model. I want to keep the suit as a souvenir. If the bid goes up a little further, I will match it. But if it goes up steeply, then I will think about proceeding further".
	Earlier, NRI businessmen Viral Chowksi offered Rs 1.11 crore, while before him textile trader Suresh Aggarwal made an offer of Rs one crore for the two-piece suit.
	The first bid was made for Rs 11 lakh by a Surat-based chartered accountant Pankaj, while few minutes later, second bid of Rs 51 lakh was made by Raju Agarwal, an estate dealer.
	"I have offered Rs 1 crore. This is work of charity and when the Prime Minister is doing for a great cause like cleaning of Ganga, I decided to go ahead and buy the suit," said Suresh Aggarwal.
	Giving a new dimension to the controversy, NRI Gujarati businessman Ramesh B Virani, who had participated in the Gujarat Vibrant Summit, said he had gifted the suit to Modi when had he gone to invite the Prime Minister for his son's wedding.
	"At that time, he (Modi) told me that he has a very busy schedule ahead and also that he will be donating the suit. I said there is no problem with that. I told him that I want him to wear the suit on the day of my son's wedding as a blessing," he said.
	The suit that created waves and kicked up a political storm was auctioned today along with 455 items that Modi had received as gifts during his nearly nine-month long tenure to generate funds for the Prime Minister's ambitious 'Clean India Mission'.
	Among other items up for auction are two T-shirts of Modi, including one gifted to him by Cricket Australia during his visit to Australia in November. The T-shirts were among 237 clothes and textile items put for auction.
	Meanwhile, reacting to the auction, Trinamool Congress leader Derek O' Brien termed the exercise as damage control public relations and said it has nothing to do with Ganga cleaning.
	PM Modi wore the deep blue bandhgala suit for a joint appearance with US President Barack Obama at Hyderabad House when he stepped out for a 'Chai Pe Charcha' meet and a press conference with the US President in New Delhi last month.
	Surat Municipal Commissioner Milind Toravane said the event is being organised at SMC's Science Convention Centre at city-lights road in Surat as the Prime Minister's Office(PMO) had decided to hold the auction event in the city.
	Modi, during his chief ministerial tenure in Gujarat, had initiated a trend to auction the gifts that he received in a year and it was donated to Kanya Kelavani Yojna for girl child education, he said.
	Whether it is with his well-fitted bandhgala suits, his half-sleeved kurta and brightly coloured Nehru jackets or his choice of an orange shawl -- Modi's style statements have always been eye-catching -- so much so that during the Obamas' visit for the country's 66th Republic Day celebrations, he stole the thunder from the US First Lady as far as fashion was concerned.

Prices for EU fresh tuna imports soaring since SL ban
	
	Prices for tuna imported into the UK are rocketing, as the European Union's ban on Sri Lankan fisheries produce nears a month of enforcement, the Undercurrent News reported.
The ban is mainly impacting imports of fresh and chilled yellowfin tuna from Sri Lanka, largely for the foodservice sector, with total imports to the EU valued at 74 million. It has left importers in the UK, and to a lesser extent France  the two main European markets  to turn to other supplies, and it is on these that prices are up.
Prices are up a great deal, Laky Zervudachi, director of sustainability and epicurean with Direct Seafoods, told Undercurrent News. Supplies from the Maldives and southern India are okay at the moment, but limited, hence the price pressure.
Since the ban, price quotes to Direct for Indian tuna have risen around 20%, and on Maldives tuna, 60%, he said.
This puts the latter, as a ball-park figure, cost price, at between 18 and 20 per kilogram.
It's serious. I'm not sure people will be able to keep tuna on their menus at that price, he said.
Tuna species director for New England Seafood International, David Jones, estimated prices for tuna out of the Maldives had seen an increase of over 30%, though identified a 60% increase as being at the the higher end of quotes.
The importer and supplier expects Maldives tuna prices to settle in the medium term at more than 20% higher than prices seen at the start of 2015.
Comptoirs Oceaniques, considered to be Frances largest importer of tuna from Sri Lanka, has also seen a tough market situation.
Prices have gone up by more than 10%; closer to 20%, said Alain Bailly, managing director of the French firm. The supply of fresh tuna, relying on not enough sources, is getting very chaotic now.
People are looking for alternative supplies, and playing things close to their chests, said Zervudachi. We've been a bit lucky with India because an existing relationship has meant our supplier isn't abusing the situation.
Other importers will likely continue to source from existing supply chain, other than Sri Lanka, for the short to medium term, as ensuring new suppliers meet food safety and sustainability standards could be a drawn-out process.
He anticipates trouble in a few months, as the Indian Ocean tends to run into a seasonal monsoon period during Europe's summer.
The boats in the Maldives are mainly small, catching with pole and line  they'll be restricted by the weather.
The Indian fishery is newer, we know less about it, but I imagine they'll have similar issues, he said.
For these reasons Direct is looking for other viable pole and line fisheries. Indonesia might have presented an option, but now is a tricky time as teh government there cracks down hard on illegal fishing, meaning a restructure for all vessels and their crews, said Zervudachi.
There is some 'superfrozen' tuna coming into the UK in small quantities  partly through Direct  mainly going to supermarkets or sushi restaurants, he said.
Only the best tuna is used for that; and on the best grades you compete with Japan, which is willing to pay for top quality.

FSP leader to be deported today
	
	The Controller General of Immigration and Emigration, Nihal Ranasinghe said yesterday that Frontline Socialist Party leader Kumar Gunaratnam (alias Noel Mudalige) would be deported today.
	He said that Gunaratnam had been told to come to the Department of Immigration and Emigration today as he had violated the Immigration and Emigration regulations, having come to the country on a tourist visa and got involved in politics. He had been told that he would be arrested with the assistance of the Police if he failed to come to the Department as instructed.
	Meanwhile, the Supreme Court yesterday rejected the rights petition filed by Kumar Gunaratnam seeking to prevent his arrest and deportation.
	The Bench, comprising Chief Justice K. Sripavan and Justices Priyasath Dep and Eva Wanasundera, held that there was no basis to grant leave to proceed with the rights petition filed by the political activist Premkumar Gunaratnam (alias Noel Mudalige) of the Frontline Socialist Party.
