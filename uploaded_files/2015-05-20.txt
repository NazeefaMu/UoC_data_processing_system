AIA wealth planners visit Stonehenge during Group Convention
	
AIA Insurance Sri Lanka?s wealth planners visited the Stonehenge, a unique world heritage site, during AIA Group?s President Club Convention, which took place in England from late April to early May.?
They entered an alternate realm of planning at the 5,000-year site in Wiltshire, England, which is shrouded in mythical and mystical reference, where the stones are believed to be part of a burial ground with supernatural power. It is said to have been a site for miracle healing and an astronomical observatory.?
Some theories say that it was built by the Druids and is likely to have been a ritual site where people turned to the priests that resided there for advice on life and their futures. ?Here, people would have sought guidance from the seers about their futures and perhaps even their pensions needs,? said the guide at the site knowing the profession of his audience. ?With numerous scientific and mystical theories on the purpose of the Stonehenge and how it came about existing, this unique gateway to the past was a reassertion of the importance people have always placed in their futures.?
The AIA President Club is the most respected annual AIA agency event, acknowledging AIA Group?s top performing producers from across Asia. It gathered around 200 Premier Agency Leaders and Premier Agents from 14 of the AIA markets this year.

	It is the normal thing for an attorney retained in a case to give legal advice to his client, not vice versa.
However, in a bizarre instance an attorney ? in fact, a much sought after one with a lucrative practice ? has agreed to appear for the defence in a well-known case on condition that the client would desist from giving him legal advice. The client in this case is a former powerful Ministerial one and a prominent member of a clan that ruled the roost for a decade.
A group of the kith and kin of this former Ministerial one now on remand and keen on getting the latter released on bail with the least delay approached the counsel to retain him in the case. The group who called on the counsel was surprised when the latter said: ?Your man thinks that he knows the law better than anyone else. I am sure that he will want to offer me also his legal advice. I will handle this case only if he gives a solemn promise not to bother me with his legal advice.?
The former Ministerial one had agreed to abide by the condition and the counsel had agreed to take on the case, they say.

	Also PAC had asked why the fund had failed to gain a profit from another investment of Rs 205.4 million, and the Governor of the Central Bank had informed the committee that fluctuations in the share market were the main reason.
	The committee had also inquired about the action taken against a labour officer who had credited Rs 3.6 million of EPF contributions to a personal account. The EPF authorities had informed it that the money had been recovered from the officer concerned.
	The committee had also asked the police to expedite investigations into the VAT scam and the Inland Revenue Department had assured them that the funds would be recovered from the persons responsible as they have made a confession.

Investing in unit trusts: What you need to know
	
By Dinesh Fernando
Navigating diverse investment tools can be perplexing for the average investor. Investor education is crucial as knowledgeable and empowered investors contribute towards a vibrant market. Unit trusts are one of many investment options available to investors. The following explores the mechanisms and types of unit trusts in the Sri Lankan market.Understanding unit trusts
Think of a unit trust as a pooling vehicle, where you gather relatively small investments from a large number of investors to make one large fund. This pool of funds is then invested in different financial instruments. The income earned from these investments is shared by the respective unit holders in proportion to the number of units owned.
A unit trust and portfolio of investments is typically overseen and managed by a professional fund management company while an independent trustee maintains custody over all the assets. The minimum amount for investing in a unit trust can be as low as Rs.1,000 depending on the fund.
How unit trusts differ from other investment tools
The biggest advantage that unit trusts offer is the diversification to a portfolio of investments, which an individual without a large base of savings will otherwise not be able to obtain on his own. A diversified portfolio has investments in a number of companies, thereby reducing risk while enhancing returns. Because of a large fund base, the asset manager will also be able to negotiate better rates, getting a higher return on his asset pool while bringing in economies of scale.
The management expertise and knowledge of the asset manager is also an added benefit of a unit trust, making it less time-intensive for the investor. An experienced fund manager will be more aware of interest rate movements and know how to minimize risk, generating higher risk adjusted returns over the long term.Role of trustees and regulators
When investing in a unit trust, investors are assured of the active involvement of regulatory bodies and a high level of transparency. An independent entity is appointed as trustee and maintains custody of the fund?s assets, representing the interests of the investors. Moreover, the trustee monitors transactions carried out by the fund on a daily basis. Financial statements are circulated regularly to investors which provide details of the fund?s progress and statement of financial performance. The Securities and Exchange Commission of Sri Lanka (SEC) licenses and regulates unit trust funds, conducts periodic on-site audits and rigorously examines the qualifications of fund managers.Types of unit trusts
There are different unit trusts, each addressing a specific investment requirement. No single unit trust will cater to the requirements of all investors. It is the asset manager?s role to match a specific fund to an investor?s requirements. The main types of unit trusts in Sri Lanka are Income Funds, Money Market Funds, Gilt Edged Funds and Equity Funds.
Income Funds invest in income generating investments such as government securities, debentures, commercial papers, structured debt instruments and even bank and finance company fixed deposits. These funds are suitable for medium to long-term investments, for income generation and capital growth. A well-managed Income Fund will generate higher returns over the long term than equivalent bank or finance company deposits.
Money Market Funds make similar investments to Income Funds, except that all investments mature within one year. ?As a result, the return on Money Market Funds is lower but its attraction is its high level of liquidity. They are good substitutes for savings accounts as your investment can be withdrawn at any time.
Gilt Edged Funds restrict investments to securities issued by the Government of Sri Lanka. Government securities are widely considered risk-free instruments and are suitable for investors wishing to eliminate all default risks associated with an institution. They are the safest investments in terms of payment of underlying principal and interest when due. However, it must be noted that government securities carry ?interest rate risk? and the value of instruments rise or decline based on interest rate changes.
Equity Funds invest primarily in shares listed on the Colombo Stock Exchange. Investments in listed shares have higher risks than investments in fixed income instruments and they can be expected to yield higher returns. They are long-term investments ? ideally an investor should have a five to 10-year investment horizon in mind when investing in an Equity Fund.Sri Lanka?s unit trust industry
Unit trusts were introduced to Sri Lanka in 1991 to provide an alternate investment for people to benefit from the capital market. The SEC, as the licensing authority, has the power to permit a fund management company (fund manager) to launch a unit trust under the SEC Act.
There are currently 14 unit trust management companies in Sri Lanka operating a total of 75 funds as at January 31, 2015, while assets under management in the entire market have grown to Rs.126 billion as at December 31, 2014. The Unit Trusts Association represents the industry to the SEC, Government and Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL).?
It also strives to maintain high professional and ethical standards in the unit trust industry and disseminate information to existing and potential investors about fund managers, performance of current funds and the process of investing in unit trusts.
(Dinesh Fernando has over 20 years? experience covering a wide range of financial service businesses including fund management, research, investment banking, commercial banking and project financing. ?Prior to joining First Capital, he was the Fund Manager at one of Sri Lanka?s oldest unit trust management companies.

When this Diyawanna member learnt that he was facing remand custody, he decided to seek the intervention of a certain Ministerial one spearheading the anti-corruption drive. An excerpt from the missive sent by this Diyawanna member to the Ministerial one in Sinhala (roughly translated into English) runs as follows: ?Sir, why are all so angry with us. What wrong have I done to you, Sir?? Please give me a chance to apprise you of the factual position. Sir, I am not a rogue. Ammapa! (I swear in the name of my mother) I am not a rogue?? He received no response to this missive. And he was arrested a few days later.

The Jathika Hela Urumaya (JHU) today urged the police and security forces to implement the law against the angry mob that tried to take the law into their hands by hiding behind the murder of a student in Jaffna recently.
The JHU said it was evident that another agenda was behind the violent protest campaign carried out by angry mobs by raising black flags, obstructing roads and staging a hartal by hiding behind this incident.
JHU media secretary Nishantha Sri Warnasinghe alleged those angry mobs were threatening the Sinhalese in Jaffna and forcing them to leave that area.
He said racist, separatist and terrorist groups were trying to raise their heads again by hiding behind this incident and added they were resorting to violent acts as well.
Mr. Warnasinghe said the law should be implemented against the culprits who committed the crime.
He said the government and security forces should take steps without any hesitation to implement the law against those who were behind the hartals and resorting to violent acts without allowing separatist and racist groups to disrupt the civilian lives in the North. (Ajith Siriwardana)

We will be looking more into corporate banking sector: NSB Chairman
	
By Chandeepa WettasingheThe state-owned National Savings Bank (NSB) will be looking to increase its presence in the corporate banking sector, a top official said.?
?We will be looking into the corporate banking sector. Particularly how we can augment our dependence on the net interest income,? NSB Chairman Aswin de Silva said.
While the National Savings Bank Act stipulates that 60 percent of the bank?s deposits be invested in government securities and of the remainder, 95 percent is focused on personal banking, with the rest a mixture of foreign exchange, corporate, etc., according to de Silva.
?We can?t bring it down to 60-65 percent like in a commercial bank. We?re a licensed specialized bank. Probably bring it down to 85 percent and replace that with corporate banking and credit finance, fee-based income and foreign exchange,? he said.
De Silva articulated that state banks have to step up to compete with commercial banks in this regard or perish, since commercial banks are now entering into long-term lending.
?We can?t have situations where they are entering into our territory and we are not doing anything to protect that. We have to change with that or we?ll find that the competition has eaten us,? he said.
He noted that the monopolies in certain banking sectors, which existed 40-50 years ago, do not exist anymore.
Meanwhile, de Silva stressed that state banks should immediately adopt the international trends of lending based on a person?s ability to repay rather than through collateral.
?I want to change that credit culture to a more cash-flow driven credit rather than collateralized credit, so that we lend money to a person not because he has a house to mortgage but because he has the cash flows to repay. There might be a situation where his house faces foreclosure. We?re helping him. He loses, we lose,? he said.
He expressed that it would not take long for the state banking sector to adopt these changes if given direction.
De Silva, a Chartered Accountant, took over the Chairmanship in March and is attempting to inject the culture of the private sector into NSB, especially through increased automation and productivity gains to boost profits.
Prior to joining NSB, he was acting in a senior managerial capacity in Sydney, Australia in the corporate sector. He had held prolific posts in the financial sector in American Express, Ceylinco Savings Bank and Associated Motorways.
