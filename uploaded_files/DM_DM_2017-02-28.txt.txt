Kepapaulavu and Pudukuduirippu: President assures release of lands within 2 days
	
President Maithripala Sirisena has assured that the lands in Kepapaulavu and Pudukuduirippu will be handed over to the people in the area within two days, Opposition Leader R Sampanthan said yesterday.
Mr Sampanthan told a media briefing last evening that the President gave this assurance when the TNA MPs met him last afternoon.
Some 54 families in Kepapaulavu have been given permits and 42 of them are reported to be in order according to investigations carried out by the Government Agent. Therefore these families will have to decide whether they are going to reside in these lands in Kepapaulavu or whether they want to go back to their original lands, Mr Sampanthan said.
When it comes to Pudukuduirippu the land will be given to 16 families when the army vacates the area after finding alternative land, he added.
The opposition leader said the President contacted the Army Commander, the acting secretary of defence and other local authorities in their presence and directed them to release all lands within two days. (Yohan Perera and Lahiri Pothmulla)

Mystery gazette on G-Secs unravelled
	
The recently surfaced mystery gazette notification with regard to government securities (G-Secs) is part of an obsolete law, which the Central Bank has been attempting to comply with, and the law would be amended as soon as possible, the countrys economic managers said yesterday.
Central Bank Governor Dr. Indrajit Coomaraswamy said that gazetting G-Sec issuances at the start of a year would have been practical under the administrative basis with which the government had issued G-Secs from 1930s, when the Registered Stocks and Securities Ordinance No. 07 of 1937 was introduced, till 1997 when the auctions started.
Once the operations in issuing the government securities gets a market dimension, it becomes impractical to give advanced notification on how much will be accepted and what the interest rate would be, because once the market forces are introduced into the system, there is more uncertainty and variability, he said.
He said the governments had been able to follow the ordinance in the past since the governments were able to decide the amount, tenures and interest rates of G-Secs at the start of the year, depending on the countrys requirement for the year.
However, Dr. Coomaraswamy noted that despite the impracticality, the Central Bank has complied with the spirit of the ordinance by providing the public with as much information as possible about G-Secs.
The Monetary Board has been publishing the details of the auctions on national newspapers and since the technology became available, on the website, so the Central Bank has substantially complied with the ordinance, he said.
He added that the Central Bank each year has reserved a gazette number from the Government Printer and after issuing all debt for a year, published the details backdated to January 1, 2015, which meant that for that specific year, the then Finance Minister Mahinda Rajapaksas name would have appeared on the gazette.
Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake said that the government was not attempting to divert any blame of the bond scandal to Rajapaksa but remained critical of Rajapaksa continuing to circumvent the ordinance instead of amending it. When our government became aware of the situation, I immediately asked the Government Printer not to publish the gazette for 2016. These gazettes have not come either to the finance minister or the treasury secretary for approval, he said.
He noted that the gazettes had been prepared by the officials in the Central Bank below the level of the Debt Department Superintendent and that it was also unusual that the gazette for 2015, which should have been sent for printing in December 2015, had been sent in November 2016. Why has the hyperactive Auditor General not found this Karunanayake questioned.
Both Dr. Coomaraswamy and Karunanayake said that while the legality of the process would be determined later, all the G-Secs issued in the past are valid and that the investors should not be worried.
All securities issued by the government of Sri Lanka are absolutely safe; they continue to be risk-free and the government of Sri Lanka is fully behind them. So no one should be concerned about the validity of government securities, Dr. Coomaraswamy explained.
Karunanayake said that the ordinance would be amended as soon as possible and if the amendments cannot be completed by March 15, when the bonds would next be issued, an administrative solution would be taken and the details of the auction would be gazetted on the following day.

Need to change school uniform: Akila
	
The Education Ministry was mulling changing the school uniforms and the dress code for pregnant teachers of the State schools, based on the different climates of different districts so as to make it comfortable for the children and teachers, Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam said today.
While addressing a ceremony at the Maliyadewa College in Kurunegala yesterday Minister Kariyawasam said school children were facing a lot of difficulties to keep their white uniforms clean.
School uniforms should be comfortable. Schools may have rights to select their suitable uniform for their children but it still remains a question, as to why those schools dont do so. In the Districts like Moneragala I see school children wearing uniforms with neck ties, the Minister said.
He said there should be a way to get rid of such uniforms and to switch to a more comfortable uniform.
Meanwhile, he also said t hat pregnant teachers used to wear the traditional Saree to school even during the advanced stages of pregnant. He said it would be very uncomfortable and not suitable dress for them.
I was planning to discuss the issue with the committee to take a decision on changing pregnant teachers dress. There are 237,000 teachers in the country and the majority of them are female teachers. The way we approach these issues is wrong, he said.
Other countries have gone too far with new ideas. The time has come to think of a proper education in a proper way to make our education on par with international standards, he noted.(Chaturanga Pradeep)

Only consolation: Sinhala filth foreign to foreign visitors
	

There is a well-known bridge that serves as a gateway to the city which received a rare honour once when a celebrated Sinhala drama was named after it. Thats just an aside. A senior purohita usually conspicuous by his milky white dress the other day took a group of foreign delegates round the ghetto-like shanty area lying under part of this bridge.

The shanty women  the menfolk being away busy with their respective occupations as usual  on seeing the unusual visitors had grown both inquisitive and suspicious. They had tagged behind the strangers walking round their domain. The purohita seemed to be explaining things to the foreigners and the women could not make head or tail of what was being said because they all were conversing in English. Their patience worn out, the womenfolk then asked the purohita why they were visiting their area. However, the purohita ignoring the shanty-folk had kept up his commentary in English for the benefit of the foreign visitors.
Furious that neither the purohita nor any official in the group cared to explain to them the purpose of their visit, the women thereafter ringed the group in a hostile manner and directed at them a stream of profanities.
The purohitas security guards who found the situation was getting out of control took prompt action to take away the purohita and all other members of the group to safety.
Thank God. Our foreign visitors didnt understand the Sinhala filth! the Ministry officials were telling each other while on their way back to office, they say.

Politico to pay for his secretarys sins
	
A prominent politician from the upcountry has become very unpopular among his constituents because of tolerating the antics of his amorous personal secretary, they say.
This personal secretary well known for his weakness for the fair sex had on a number of occasions sought sexual favours from young attractive women who had visited his office. He is said to be corrupt too. It has come to light that he had misappropriated part of a stock of cement bags made available to the politician concerned for distribution among the poor in the area.
People in the area say that the politician has turned a deaf ear to the complaints that they have made against his personal secretary. And they vow to teach the politician a lesson come the next general polls.

Produce Duminda in Court: Magistrate
	
Duminda Silva had been ordered to be produced in court following a report given by a panel of doctors of the Colombo National Hospital.
Colombo Additional Magistrate Ranga Dissanayake directed the Prisons Department to produce Silva before Court.
Examining the suspect's health condition, a panel of consultants in their report said that there was no obstacle to produce the suspect before court.
Earlier the court directed the Prisons Department to produce suspect Duminda Silva before Colombo National Hospital to examine his health condition under a special panel of doctors as to confirm suspect's inability of appearing before court due to his illness.
The suspect was not produced before court by the Prisons Officers earlier for the ongoing three bribery cases over the charges of not declaring his assets and liabilities for three years.
The Bribery Commission had filed three separate cases against Mr. Silva under the Assets and Liabilities Act for not declaring his assets in 2010, 2011 and 2013.
The Bribery Commission had named Parliament Deputy Secretary General P.M. Neil Parakrama and several others as witnesses. Senior Counsel Anuja Premaratne appeared for the defence.
Earlier, the Colombo High Court sentenced him to death after being convicted of the murder of Bharatha Lakshman Premachandra. (Shehan Chamika Silva)

They came uninvited and stole the show
	

A former Deputy from Wayamba recently hosted a political heavyweight in the country to a luncheon at his residence.

The host and his wife were shocked when a sitting Diyawanna member from the same area and his charming wife who were not invited boldly stepped into their residence, walked up to the guest of honour and started a conversation with him.
What was worse was that the former deputy and the Diyawanna member were arch enemies. Some time ago the Diyawanna members supporters had set upon the former deputys son while the member looked. The strained relationship between the two had turned into enmity since that incident.
While the hosts were fuming inwardly, the uninvited guest and his wife were seen enjoying a chat with the political heavyweight who was unaware of the undercurrents.

We are hopeful of a political solution 	- GTF
	
With the commencement of the UNHRC session featuring Sri Lankas case among others, Suren Sirendiran, the spokesperson for Global Tamil Forum, a leading Tamil Diaspora Organisation, articulates the implementation of its resolution, action regarding alleged war crimes and the way forward. The interview conducted by email:

Ahead of the UNHRC session, how do you analyze the progress made by the government in addressing your aspirations
Progress is dead slow and minimal.
It is now obvious that Sri Lanka wouldnt have made any significant progress by March 2017 in implementing the UNHRC resolution that it co-sponsored. Therefore, it is inevitable that Sri Lanka will request an extension to the timeline. It will only be conceivable that the member states will agree to extend, through a new rollover resolution.
Status of implementation of the Resolution A/HRC/30/L.29 by the Government of Sri Lanka will still be work in progress. Therefore, until full implementation of the resolution, somehow Sri Lanka must remain in focus for the Human Rights Council. If that formal focus and monitoring can only be delivered via another resolution, then that is what should happen.
As the co-sponsor of the resolution and the responsible government to implement the resolution on behalf of its people, one would hope that Government of Sri Lanka would bring a resolution to extend the timeline without renegotiating the content of the resolution. I am sure that will be supported by majority of the member states.
It is pertinent to be reminded of the Foreign Ministers speech in September 2015 at the UNHRC, where he said and I quote Dont judge us by the broken promises, experiences and U-turns of the past. My plea to you Ladies and Gentlemen, is trust us and join us to work together and create the momentum required to move forward and take progressive, meaningful and transformative steps to create a new Sri Lanka. 
One of the reasons Government of Sri Lanka may suggest for the lack of progress is the political reality in the country. Blaming and making the Rajapaksa Demon as one of the reasons for the lack of progress is by and large a false pretence. The so called joint opposition has just over 50 in a 225 Members Parliament. In reality, the joint opposition hasnt demonstrated in any significant manner as a threat in any form to the current regime, so far.
We were encouraged when Government of Sri Lanka co-sponsored the UNHRC resolution in Oct 2015, which recognised terrible crimes committed by both parties during the armed conflict  was a turning point for human rights in Sri Lanka. We welcomed the less triumphalist approach adopted during the end of war anniversary on May 18th. We also welcomed the much improved cooperation with UN agencies on human rights mechanisms, and the initiatives taken towards setting up the Office of the Missing Persons  though legislation was passed in the parliament in August 2016, only a few weeks ago it was finally gazetted, nearly five months after. The action of gazetting allows implementation.


Global Tamil Forum (GTF) also formally welcomed the recommendations of the Consultation Task Force on Reconciliation Mechanisms (CTF) released on January 3, 2017.
However, there has been very little visible progress being made on the accountability mechanism. GTF is also disappointed at the governments insufficient efforts in embracing the critically important transitional justice mechanisms, which in our view, should be embedded in the constitutional reform process to permanently end the culture of impunity and to promote genuine reconciliation. A wide range of institutional reforms including the much needed security sector reform, strengthening of the witness protection legislation which at present falls far short of what is required, and genuine consultations with victims and their families in every step of the process to get to truth and justice are vitally important measures ought to be undertaken by the government without further delay. Several of the crimes alleged to have been committed by both sides amount to war crimes and crimes against humanity. These are not recognised as crimes in the current judicial system. Legislations have to be passed by the Parliament to recognise these as crimes. These havent even begun.
Very little or no discourse has begun on reparation.
How hopeful are you that the constitution making process would be a success
The success of implementing a new constitution is the only hope for a successful and peaceful Sri Lanka for our next generations. The current political environment with a unity government with leaders of moderate views in power and a very reasonable Tamil opposition in parliament with people overwhelmingly rejecting extremism from both communities in the last two major elections is probably the best time in the history of Sri Lanka to achieve success in implementing a new constitution. Therefore, we are very hopeful.
There is a lot of objection here to the proposed judicial mechanism with the participation of foreign judges to hear accountability issues What is your stand
President Maithripala Sirisena publicly states that there wont be any international judges in the judicial mechanism to address accountability for the alleged crimes. Recently in a speech in Maharagama, the President said that in his speech at the UN General Assembly he has stated this very clearly and the international community has now accepted that there wont be any international Judges.
Even the Prime Minister said in an interview to an Indian media outlet that there wont be any international Judges. We have serious concerns over this. The lack of political will and courage demonstrated by the Sinhala leaders including the President and the PM to engage in discourse among the Sinhala people for the need to establish the truth of what happened and the importance of accountability for the wrongs that were done against another community of their own citizens, is a serious impediment we believe, to deliver justice to the victims.
The mixed messages relayed to key stakeholders including the victims, military, other citizens of Sri Lanka and international community by senior state officials including the President, PM and Foreign Minister reflect that there is no cohesive and coordinated government policy as yet on this important international commitment.

	UNHRC resolution should not be altered
	
	
	GTF helped in regime change of Sri Lanka
	
	
	International pressure is a sin-quo-non to get justice for victims
	
	
	Concerned over rejection of foreign judges by President, PM
	
	
	GTF disappointed the way MS Govt. handled N/E issues
	
Until there are concerted efforts taken to make understand and accept by Sinhala civil society, Sinhala media and Buddhist clergy that there were gross violations of local and international human rights and humanitarian laws by the military but not by the entire military, during and after the end of war, there can only be marginal perceived successes, in the government implementation of the transitional justice program.
As I said above, by co-sponsoring the resolution the President and his government have committed to all its conditions as stipulated.
Just to remind once again, the resolution 30/1 states and I quote again affirms that a credible justice process should include independent judicial and prosecutorial institutions led by individuals known for their integrity and impartiality; and also affirms in this regard the importance of participation in a Sri Lankan judicial mechanism, including the special counsels office, of Commonwealth and other foreign Judges, defence lawyers and authorized prosecutors and investigators
A credible and impartial judicial process is so fundamental to come to terms with our violent past that is littered with not only the crimes committed against the members of each community, but also on their behalf.
Recommendations of the Consultation Task Force on Reconciliation Mechanisms (CTF) released on January 3, 2017 also very clearly states that foreign participation is required as those who suffered during the conflict had no faith in local judiciary which lacked expertise to undertake such task very much resonates with the victims of the Tamil community.
This is a long-standing view that is further reinforced with the recent verdict on the murder case of former Tamil Parliamentarian Nadarajah Raviraj.
GTF shared its deep dismay by the statements of two responsible ministers in the unity government denouncing the recommendations of the Consultation Task Force on Reconciliation Mechanisms (CTF) calling for foreign participation in the judicial mechanisms.
There are talks about the resurgence of LTTE terrorism. One TNA MP has also received death threats. How is it possible for the LTTE to raise its head again
When asking this question one must remember the history of what really happened to the Tamil people of Sri Lanka since independence and how and why an armed struggle began!
Listed below are a recapture of a few of the circumstances that prevailed prior to an armed struggle that was initiated by the Tamil youth:
Almost a million Tamils of Indian origin were disenfranchised within an year of independence
	Sinhala only as the official language was introduced
	Several (e.g. 1956, 58, 77, 83 to list a few) State-sponsored pogroms which killed thousands of Tamils and burnt down their assets
	State-sponsored colonisation of Tamil land with Sinhala people with an intention to force change the demography of land which historically is the habitat of Tamils
	Several of the protections of minority communities rights that were enshrined in the Soulbury Constitution were abrogated
	The oldest public library in Asia was burnt down by the army with government sponsorship
	Several legislations were passed in the parliament discriminating minorities, particularly targeting Tamils who were performing better than the majority community in education, civil service, industry etc.
	Many of the attempted protests and objections through democratic means since independence until an armed struggle began were summarily suppressed by violent force by successive governments
	Several of the peace pacts that were reached between leaders of communities to resolve these political grievances of Tamil people were unilaterally abrogated by successive Sinhala leaders, parties and governments
To add to some of these same grievances, at present:
There still remains a constitution that safeguards a majoritarian rule with an executive presidency with most political and legislative powers being centralised and which elevates one religion over the rest
	An overwhelming presence of military in the majority Tamil areas
	Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA) still in force
	No judicial mechanism or most demands to serve justice through the UNHRC resolution 30/1 still unaccomplished
	Confiscated private and government land still being occupied by military and people being displaced from their own places of habitat
	Some of the political prisoners who were arrested under the PTA still remain in custody without being charged or due process followed
	Torture and sexual violence, particularly against women still practiced with impunity
	State-sponsored colonisation still being implemented in the north and east of Sri Lanka
	A politicised judiciary that has lost all confidence of victims (e.g. case of former parliamentarian Raviraj, release of suspects in the case of disappearance of journalist Prageeth Ekneligoda and several others) With points above, I will let the readers decide the answer to your question.
The new US administration has a different world view. In that context, how can Tamil Diaspora count more on that country in pursuing action through the UNHRC
Sri Lanka has time and time again shown it is both unwilling and unable to investigate allegations of war crimes against its own forces or hold perpetrators of grave abuses to account. It appears the government is now trying to back away from this commitment. Given the history of failures of Government Commissions and judicial processes, international participation as specified in the resolution is a must to guarantee the credibility and effectiveness of any Special Court.
At such a critical time when the Sri Lankan governments political will and its ability to fully implement the key recommendations of the UNHRC resolution are being questioned, the International Community needs to be resolutely engaged, so that Sri Lanka stays on course towards genuine reform, and implements the resolution it co-sponsored without any exceptions.
In my mind, if there is no international pressure, there wont be any justice served in Sri Lanka for the victims. I think, that is very well understood by most of the member states including the US, UK of the UNHRC, too.
Tamils voted overwhelmingly for President Maithripala Sirisena at the election. How do you see his performance
If I have to describe it in a word, unfortunately I will have to say, disappointing. Most Sri Lankans feel generally let down by this government as several of their manifesto commitments havent been implemented.
This government came to power claiming to clean up corruption and mismanagement that prevailed during the previous regime and bring to justice those who abused their authority in various ways. Unfortunately, neither have they been able to prosecute anyone successfully nor have they been able to run a government without various major corruption charges being levelled against them.
Tamils of North and East voted overwhelmingly for the President and made the biggest difference in bringing him to power hoping that the new government will implement Constitutional reforms to resolve the decades old national question, will deliver justice to people for the wrongs that were done to them in breach of international laws, will publicly pronounce of zero tolerance of sexual violence and torture, particularly by the police and military and proactively investigate and prosecute any such allegations without denying, which had been the Rajapaksa attitude. Tamils believed that most of the occupied lands will be released to lawful owners within months, resettlement of internally displaced people would be prioritised, military presence in the North and East will be reduced to the same levels as the rest of the country, political prisoners will be released or will be charged in a court of law forthwith, the draconian Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA) will be repealed, government will give the war affected provinces a special priority status and create and facilitate investment opportunities to regenerate the areas to be economically at least at par with the rest of Sri Lanka.
The record over the past several months is reflected in the disappointment and despair that these communities feel at present.
However, the overall trajectory remains in the right direction but, just! This government has created democratic space for freedom of expression without fear of reprisals, reversing the 18th Amendment to the Constitution which by and large politicised all independent democratic institutions, initiating a process to introduce a new constitution for the country, agreeing to co-sponsor a resolution at the UNHRC and proactively engaging with the UN and other international institutions, releasing some of the land that were illegally occupied by the military and other state institutions, releasing some of the political prisoners, introducing civilian governors to the Northern and Eastern Provinces.
We hear different voices among the Tamil diaspora groups. How do you respond to it
Let me speak on behalf of GTF; at GTF, we like to think that we also helped in a small way to bring this change of regime in Sri Lanka. GTF believes that through proactive and constructive engagement further changes can be influenced. We have met the Foreign Minister and other state officials several times and met with the President, twice. GTF will encourage the government when progressive steps are being taken but will not shy away to publicly critique the government when repressive or regressive steps are taken or even suggested.
Among all Diaspora organisations GTF has gained recognition within Sri Lanka and internationally in a relatively short time since the end of war. It didnt come easily. Sheer hard and committed work by many brought it to this status. As an organisation we also followed certain basic code of conduct to discipline ourselves. For example we committed ourselves not to comment or contradict in public of statements, actions or activities of another fellow Tamil organisation be it from Sri Lanka or in the Diaspora. As an organisation from our formal inauguration at the UK Parliament in February 2010 we also committed that we will not issue statements for the sake of it or to play it to the gallery. As a responsible organisation largely working in international diplomacy and lobbying, we pride ourselves for maintaining discretion which is fundamental. Some of these behaviours and actions earned respect amongst various media and rights organisations as well as within governments of adopted countries. GTF has always acted honourably and reasonably when articulating grievances of our people in Sri Lanka at international forums. This earned respect from organisations and like-minded people of all ethnicities and religions of Sri Lanka. We have a clear and transparent strategy in how we want to deal with issues and grievances of our people in the island, which we generally refer to as the Four Pillar Programme. They are:
1. Agreeing between Tamil representatives based in Sri Lanka and in the Diaspora a Common Framework Agreement (CFA).

2. Engaging the civil society, political and non-political representatives of the South without discriminating on language, religion, social status or party affiliation to communicate and engage to explain our grievances and understand from them their own grievances and why resolving the political issues including the Tamil National Question is seen or felt as a threat to them. Explain the possible mutual benefits that will be gained by all communities as peace dividends if a durable political solution could be negotiated to the Tamil National Question.
These types of cross community engagements at different levels of the society can also be a way to bridge the trust deficiency that exists between communities in Sri Lanka.

3.  Actively lobby and create awareness within the international community, international institutions and governments regarding the injustices and alleged breaches of international laws, including international human rights and humanitarian laws that amounted to war crimes and crimes against humanity. Lobby for international independent investigation of both sides to establish the truth and obtain justice to enable the people who lost their loved ones to be able to move on, which may allow sustainable reconciliation between communities in the future.

4. To work to resolve the socio economic needs of the people of Sri Lanka, particularly in the war affected areas with international help.
We intend to do all of the above with the help of the people in Sri Lanka, in the diaspora and the international community including India.
Obviously everyone can see that none of these are against the State of Sri Lanka or its sovereignty or any group or particular community of Sri Lanka or promotes violence or terrorism. This enabled GTF to work with like-minded people of all communities, groups, organisations, media and political and non-political parties within Sri Lanka. GTF prides itself as one of the most effective and efficient groups which partners with the elected representatives of the Tamil people in Sri Lanka.

A seat too hot for even family members
	

A state-run body handling public transport in a certain province got its fifth successive head since the yahapalanaya took office in 2015.

The person appointed as the latest head of the authority is said to be the brother-in-law of the purohita in charge of the subject of public transport.
The first appointee to this post under yahapalanaya was the purohitas son-in-law. He quit the job saying that the father-in-law was interfering too much. He was succeeded by a bus magnate. He too did not last long in the post. The third appointee was a former commissioner for co-operatives. He had to go to make way for a close buddy of a onetime powerful politician.

Angoda Loku behind shooting
	
Western Province crimes, road safety and traffic in charge, Senior DIG Nandana Munasinghe, who is leading the investigations into the shooting incident in Kalutara yesterday said according to initial investigations a prominent underworld leader 'Angoda Loku' and several leading underworld figures were behind yesterday's shooting.
We are suspecting that Angoda Loku and several others were behind the shooting and their target was Samayan. This may be a result of a long-lasted revenge between the two factions and the two factions clashed eachother in few occasions earlier. So far evidence found confirming the suspects had waited till the Prison bus arrived more than two hours, he said.
He further said the assassins had come armed and well prepared.
The suspects had come with heavily armed with T-56 rifles and were organized well. They were known that the bus arrives in the usual route.
After committing the crime they had immediately fled the scene using a Van while leaving the vehicle which they have used to obstruct the road, DIG said.
Meanwhile, police media said that five Police units had been deployed to investigate into the yesterdays prison bus shooting incident in Kalutara and to capture the suspects who fled the crime scene, Police said.
The police investigation carried out so far had revealed that the suspects,who were wearing Khaki-suites in the guise of police officers when they carried out the crime, had been identified. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

CMA unhappy over gazette on face-covered helmets
	
The Ceylon Motorcyclists Association (CMA) has expressed displeasure over gazette notice directing motorcyclists including pillion riders to wear protective helmets which do not conceal any part of the wearer's face.
In a letter to President Maithripala Sirisena the CMA said the gazette notice had been issued in contempt of the April 2, 2015 Court order which stayed the ban on face-covered helmets.
The gazette notice issued by Transport Minister Nimal Siripala is an indirect ban on face-covered helmets. A rider has a clear vision by wearing contrasting helmets which obstructs sunlight. The use of such helmets have been banned, CMA Secretary Chirantha Amarasinghe said.
He said even when the government imposed a ban on face-covered helmet there was no drop in road accidents.
Mr. Amarasinghe said the CMA was of the view that the use of helmets should be standardised but wondered whether the gazette notice would impact on full-face helmets such as DOT, Snell and ECE, which are of international standards.
However, the Chairman of the National Council for Road Safety, Dr. Sisira Kodagoda said the normal chin-guard helmets have not been banned.
The gazette notice only has only banned the face-covered helmets used in racing. The reason behind banning the face-covered helmets because the chin guard is too long and obstructs a clear view of the speed 'o meter, he said adding that the ban was meant to ensure public safety.

Deportation of Lankan student halted
	
A university student who faced being deported from the UK to Sri Lanka has had the order halted hours before she was due to board a plane.
Shiromini Satkunarajah, who is studying electrical engineering at Bangor University, North Wales, faced being sent to her country of birth with her mother Roshina on Tuesday morning.
The student, who has lived in the UK since she was 12, faced leaving the UK three months before completing her degree.
The Home Office rescinded her deportation order on Monday, shortly after her local MP Hywel Williams raised a point of order in the House of Commons.
Satkunarajah and her mother were due to be released from Yarls Wood detention centre on Monday evening.
Williams, the Plaid Cymru Westminster leader, said: This is the news weve all been hoping for. Im so very glad that Shiromini and her mum have had this deportation order rescinded and released from the detention centre.
Id like to thank everyone who backed the campaign to have the deportation order lifted. So much has been achieved in so little time.
He added: The outpouring of support from across the country has been staggering, particularly from North Wales, where Shiromini is highly regarded within the Bangor community.
Since the campaign was launched on Friday Ive received messages of support for Shiromini from across the country and Im glad that Bangor University will now be able to welcome one of their best students back.
Of course the campaign to right this unjust situation is not over. There is clearly something seriously wrong with the current system and it is an issue I intend to pursue. (The Guardian)

Govt. not committed to uphold unitary status - Sri Lanka Global Forum
	
Sri Lanka Global Forum, an umbrella organization of Sri Lankans domiciled abroad, says it will work hard for the preservation of the unitary status of the country. In an interviewwith Daily Mirror , its Sri Lanka coordinator Nuwan Ballanthudawa said his organizations would send a delegation to Geneva to lobby against any plan to victimize the security forces that ended the war on terror. Excerpts:
What made you to formSri Lanka Global Forum
Sri Lanka Global Forum is an umbrella organization of the patriotic organizations operating all different countries. We have member organizations in Australia, New Zeeland, Canada, the United Kingdom, France, Italy and Switzerland. Recently, Japan and South Korea also joined us. Those associations remained in these countries for a long time. They were working and campaigning for Sri Lanka. That is to protect the unitary status. They also had a huge struggle against the LTTE propaganda against Sri Lanka from early 1980s. After the election of the new government in 2015, we knew it was installed with the support of pro-LTTE Tamil Diaspora, the US and India. So, we decided to come together rather than working individually. Sri Lanka Global Forum is a new organization, but the members have been working for the same objective for a long time.
The main objective is to protect the unitary status and to defend the security forces which fought for this country. 
As Sri Lankans domiciled abroad, how did you feel such a threat after the election
We realized that this government was supported by the Tamil Diaspora, the US and other countries. Once, MP Jayampathi Wickramaratne told at a Tamil Diaspora meeting in London that a new Constitution would be unrealistic as long as Mahinda Rajapaksa remained in presidency. The whole objective of regime change is to introduce a new constitution. Going by the actions taken by the government right now, specially according to the committee reports published by the Constitutional Assembly  it is not committed to protect the unitary status or to defend the security forces. In fact the reports expressly propose to do away with the unitary system which they consider as an impediment to the provincial councils. During the last couple of years, they have not taken any action to uphold the unitary status or to defend the military.
In your view, what is the responsibility of expatriate Sri Lankan community atthis hour
You know the government secured power with the promise to introduce democratic norms and good governance. It is not the right thing that they are doing at the moment. You have to educate the international leaders about it. Democracy is not implemented despite their pious pronouncements. I met a couple of representatives of the executive committee of the UK Parliament. I told them that the local authorities election has not been conducted for two years now. They were surprised. They said almost all their parliamentarians started their political career at local authorities level. They were here for a training programme. They asked how can you run a country without the local authorities functioning. That is the building block of democracy. Not only that, the Joint Opposition has been denied the role of the main opposition in Parliament despite it having 51 members. We wrote to the Ministers and the local authorities in other countries during the last two months about the deterioration of democracy under the current government. We are now informing the international community about it. Current government is in an unprecedented political conflict of interest. President Sirisena is commanding the party that rejected him with 5.8 million votes. If it is the democracy, he should either bow to the mandate of those 5.8 million or must remain with the UNP coalition. 
Some say the concepts of good governance or democratic norms work marvelously in the western countries. As a person living in such a country, how do you see the applicability of such concepts here
If you look at the international media, you find them as good marketable concepts. Here, for them, these have become marketable slogans. 
These rulers used such concepts for politically marketable purposes during the election time. They are not genuinely interested in implementing such concepts in the real context.
Even the ministerial posts were given to those having their names tainted over corruption allegations. We tell the people that these politicians are not really for good governance. They use this as a marketing slogan. If the government is committed to good governance, why didnt Arjuna Mahendran appear before the Financial Crimes Investigation Division (FCID) The PM is the head of the Cabinet Steering Committee that has the power to refer the matters to FCID.

	GTF is a political front advocating separatism
	
	
	Good governance is only a marketing slogan for Govt.
	
	
	It is not committed to real democratic values
	
	
	13th Amendment is also too much
	
	
	Will lead a delegation to Geneva to campaign for Sri Lanka
	
How organized is the Sri Lankan community living outside the country
Actually, we were organized. We have come together. We even organized a demonstration in Perth during PM Ranil Wickremesinghes visit. The GSLF is a legally registered entity in Italy under EU law. We have established a strong branch network in above countries.
Now, your forum is seen as an outfit formed by the Sinhalese only. How do you accommodate others
We have a great support from Tamils living in Europe. We are communicating with them. For the next session of the UNHRC, we are going to Geneva with a team of experts. We will have some Tamils. We have a strong Tamil voice against the LTTE in Europe. I had a discussion with them. I asked them whether they felt any discrimination in Sri Lanka. They do not demand for a separate State. They want a Sri Lankan government protecting the Tamils minorities and its rights. Nothing other than that.
Is yours an organizationto counter the Global Tamil Forum
It is just a front organization of the separatist movement. Apart from this, they have Tamil Rehabilitation Organization, Canadian Tamil Forum etc. These are front organizations of the LTTE. The LTTE only operated on the ground with a military wing. All the others are political wings espousing the same ideology.
However, the government views the Global Tamil Forum as a moderate outfit. How do you respond
How can one say it is moderate as long as they do not accept reality which is a historical truth about this country All what they do is using different methods to achieve the same final objective.
What they want is a separate state at the end. Up to the period of Appapillai Amirthalingam, they tried to get it through political means. Then, they understood it is impossible. Then, they allowed the LTTE to take up arms and go on a killing spree. They know they cannot achieve the goals by violent means. GTF is a political movement advocating separatism. Only the approach is different.
The government talks about multiculturalism and reconciliation. They cite examples from the west to promote these ideas. How do you see it
I have been in Australia for ten years. The multiculturalism they have is integration. In that country, others are allowed to exercise their identity to a certain extent. You can go to a Buddhist temple, Hindu Kovil or whatever. One cannot ask for a separate state. Here, we have everything. So far, in the Australian Parliament, they have only one member representing the
Aboriginal community.
That community is the original owner of the Australian land. Only in 1969, Australia recognized Aboriginals as citizens. What happened in Sri Lanka We have a different situation Our Chief Justice is a Tamil. We have no any bar. In Wellawatta, you find so many Hindu temples. We do not haveany discrimination.
Are you trying to say that the Sri Lankan systemis unique
Yes. What we say is that we are not asking any minority to leave the country. We do not deny their right to live here. What we are saying is Sri Lanka is a predominantly a Sinhala-Buddhist country. In history, when the country was threatened, it was the Sinhalese who defended it. Others may have contributed to it. Only the Sinhala Buddhists took the leadership to it. They introduced an amazing irrigation system. A land becomes a country with the irrigation culture. We are the people who createdthis civilization.
How do you look at the current Constitution making process
Actually, I had some close involvement with the process. I attended the deliberations of one of these committees. What is happening is not what President Maithripala Sirisena had promised. He said he would go for reforms in consistent with the current Constitution only. It means he did not want to go for reforms warranting a referendum. That is mentioned in his election manifesto. Later, resolution was brought to Parliament to establish the Constitutional Assembly. In that, the PM, who moved it, said the new Constitution would be approved by people at a referendum. It is contradictory to the election pledge. The President got a bulk of his votes from the north and the east. Even those people have given a mandate to the manifesto. He clearly said he would not go for a referendum in the manifesto. The Presidential Election is not the right platform to seek such a mandate. It is meant to elect a person to exercise executive powers. He himself cannot abolish the system. He should refer it to Parliament for abolition. At the 2015 parliamentary election, none of the parties got a mandate to form even a simple majority. To amend the constitution, you need two-thirds. It means it needs wider agreement among the public. The public agreement has to be reflected at the general election. But, not even half of Parliament was elected to go for referendum. Though the government is democratic, it clearly violates the democratic principles. They assume a mandate not given to them. If the President wants a unitary State, in fact, he should go even lower than powers devolved under the 13th Amendment. Even the 13th Amendment is too much.
Do you believe in the decentralization of administrative powers
When it comes to decentralization, this is the delegation of administrative power. When it comes to a Federal state, it involves the devolution of executive, legislative and judicial power. In decentralization, you do not vest these powers with another entity.
There is a lot of talk about the move to set up a judicial mechanism to hear war crime charges. How strong are you to lobby against the Tamil Diaspora pressing forsuch charges
That is what we are going to do in Geneva. There is the UNHRC and other bodies formed under the UN charter. The UN should exist. The states are the members of it. The article II of the UN charter says all the countries have their rights to defend their territorial integrity. The UN Security Council should not intervene in the internal or domestic affairs of a country. The LTTE fought for a separate state. We have every right to counter it. It is the Sri Lanka Army that saved the lives of Tamil people held hostage by the LTTE. It is the Sri Lankan government that even fed the LTTE cadres. We have acted according to the norms in fighting the war.
However, the LTTE was able to establish misconceptions in the western world through their propaganda activities. Whydid you fail
We failed for two reasons. One is on the part of the government concerned. If they had told the world properly that there is no discrimination, the LTTE would not have been able to plant these misconceptions. By remaining in silence, we gave them space. In that context, our association is very important. In Australia, we fought it bravely. In the UK, they did it. Our diaspora is different from theLTTE diaspora. They are involved in peoples smuggling, drugs smuggling etc. Our members earn only through legal means.
How involved are you with the activities of the Joint Opposition
We are in contact with them. When it comes to a common objective, we are together. In the Constitution making process, we believe that it is illegal. It is against the mandate. We want the JO to come out of the process.
It is insisting that it has to be in the process to know what is transpiring. Not only JO, we can cooperate with any other organization that stands by the unitary State.
The GSLF, as a part of a national movement, endures to work for the countrys unity and peace and vow to continue towards thatendless struggle.

Health Minister must state his opinion on AC ruling: GMOA
	
The Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) today wrote to Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne to state his frank opinion on the Appeal Court ruling on the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM) in Malabe instead making contradictory statements.
GMOA Secretary Dr. Naveen D. Zoysa told a media briefing that the Deputy Solicitor General (DSG) who appeared for Minister Senaratne had told courts that the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) was not empowered to visit private institutions such as the SAITM.
It is surprising to note that the Ministers counsel had made such a statement in court while outside Courts he had said the Health Ministry worked according to the recommendations of the SLMC. The minister should clearly state whether he advised the DSG to express the ministers actual opinion on this matter, Dr. Zoysa said.
Dr. Zoysa said a proper inquiry should be launched against the Deputy Solicitor General for acting against the instructions of his client, if he had expressed something that went against Minister Senaratnes instructions. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)

JO says Governor assured MR not responsible
	
The Joint Opposition yesterday said Central Bank Governor Indrajit Coomaraswamy has assured that former President and MP Mahinda Rajapaksa had no involvement in the controversial gazette which is said to have resulted in the Bond Sale Scam.
The Governor had conveyed this to the group of JO MPs who visited the Central Bank yesterday. The MPs visited the Central Bank and met the Governor as it had been two years since the controversial Bond Sale Scam had taken place at the Central Bank.
MP Bandula Gunawardane said the Finance Minister and the government were attempting to put the blame of the issue on Mr. Rajapaksa and to sweep the issue under the carpet.
We inquired from the Governor as to why no action being taken against the Perpetual Treasuries, which is involved in the Bond Sale scam. Meanwhile, the government attempts to drag Mr. Rajapaksa into the blunder. However, the governor said Mr. Rajapaksa was not responsible for the gazette and he was not involved in the bond sale scam, the MP told journalists outside the Central Bank.
He said the JO was hoping to submit evidence with regard to the misappropriation to the special presidential commission appointed by the President to look into the issue.
Speaking to the media, MP Namal Rajapaksa said they had requested the governor to expedite the internal probe into the bond scam. It had been two years without any action. The alleged company still engages in bond sale. Why the CB couldnt at least halt their license temporarily, he questioned. In a surprising move, he said, the Perpetual Treasuries had filed a case against the Central Bank. This is absurd, he said.
The MP said they had requested Governor Coomaraswamy to clear the air over the gazette and Mr. Rajapaksa. We will seek legal action against unscrupulous allegations. The Governor also said allegations are false. We requested him to clarify the issue, he said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

## Title: Kadhapola Thera, a hero of the nation
## Section: News Features

Kadhapola Thera, a hero of the nation
	
The surroundings of the Vihare. 
Viscount Torrington ordered the shooting of a Buddhist Priest in the same saffron robes he had worn the previous day for a dumb military trial. The Thera was to be shot by a firing squad of three but only one shot the Buddhist Priest on August 24, 1848 on the Sacred grounds of Maha Maluwa. The soldiers did not act as their colleagues did with freedom fighter Scotsman Walsh, whose flesh was cut off and thrown all over the streets of Edinburgh. 
The Temple where Kadhapola lived 


The only time the Sacred Tooth Relic was brought out of the Sri Dalada Maligawa was in 1828, to the Maha Maluwa at the insistence of the Governor Sir Edward Barnes, which resulted in the famous Dalada Vatura. 
The Thera also suffered at the hands of the two Maha Vihares, when they denied he belonged to their temples. He lived at Kahalle Temple. Members of the Military forces even shot into the Viharege to bring out the Thera. 
President Maithripala Sirisena is to De-gazette formally on the first of March by signing a document in Kandy to wipe out the stigma of being a traitor of Maha Adikaram Monarawila Keppetipola and those who have been gazetted by the British administration at that time. 
Maha Adikaram Keppetipola was a traitor to the British but not to the Sinhala Nation, although he was in the pay of the British before he went to Uva to suppress the uprising after the shooting of Government Agent Wilson. 


It is an accepted fact that Maha Adikaram Keppetipola and those on the list of the British were only a fragment of those who were in the uprising against the British. What about the thousands who were in the uprising in Sabaragamuwa and Uva What about those who forsook their homeland of Sabaragamuwa and Uva and fled to other areas within the Kandyan Kingdom fearing death at foreign hands They are part and parcel of history and are equal to the Maha Adikaram and others. 
The greatest sacrifice made during the British regime was by a Buddhist monk. The British shot Venerable Kadhapola Thera at Maha Maluwa- the sacred piece of land opposite the Sri Dalada Maligawa. When the British questioned the Chapter to whom he belonged, everyone denied that he was a monk. They did not want to displease the British administration. But even among the British at that time there were persons like the then Queens Advocate H.C. Selby, who is reported to have pleaded with Viscount Torrington that the life of the monk should be spared. His blunt answer was Even if all the lawyers in this place plead, yet he shall die in the morning. Even an appeal was denied to the monk. He was shot in cold blood in the early hours of the morning the day after the trial in August 1848. The shooting was on the Maha Maluwa with his blood oozing out on to the grounds.
The door 



These uprisings against the British really commenced in 1843 with the conviction at Kurunegala of Venerable Chandraguptha, over the knowledge of a Pretender. The Thera was executed and hung on a tree for four days. The simmering currents against the British continued both at Kandy and Kurunegala until Government Agent Buller nailed it with the tax collection. 
What was his charge against Venerable Kadhapola Thera The monk had refused to give evidence against the rioters and name them. In other words, for not spying on his fellow men. The next charge was that he knew where the Pretender could be found - that was the only other charge and the monk was shot. 
That was the only shooting of a Buddhist monk at Maha Maluwa in the history of the country by the British. Of course Viscount Torrington paid for this act with his  Honorable  recall and a Committee of Inquiry by the British Parliament. 
The British Press also critisised the shooting of the monk which created the background for a Committee of inquiry by Parliament. 
Who was this monk He was the first person who threw the ball which began the famous Matale riots against the British. Kadhapola Thera, a member of the Malwatta Maha Vihare, was born at Kahalle in Katugastota. The Thera was young and a firebrand even within the Chapter and was looking out for someone to lead an uprising against the British. He left the Chapter and went to the wilds of Dambulla where it is alleged that he crowned a Pretender, who wanted to oust the British from Kandyan Territory. 

"Who was this monk He was the first person who threw the ball which began the famous Matale riots against the British. Kadhapola Thera, a member of the Malwatta Maha Vihare, was born at Kahalle in Katugastota"
Monks have been freedom fighters to free the land from foreign domination and also from forces within the country. Even administrators have sometimes forgotten that the clergy in the country have been true freedom fighters from within their own temples. The have always lived with people around them, irrespective of their religion or community. 
Two classic examples are the land given to build the present Meera Macan Mosque in Kandy, which is Asgiri Maha Vihare property. Then the Church in the centre of the city - St Pauls Church stands on Sri Dalada Maligawa Land. These two buildings remind us and those who visit Sri Lanka that Buddhists and other religions live side by side in the country. 
The rebellion was initiated by the people of Uva on the death of Government Agent Sylvestor. The Maha Adikaram was ordered by the British to quell the riots of the people. It is here that the people surrounded him and questioned whether he was with them. It was then that the Maha Adikaram sent back the arsenal to Kandy and joined the people. Therefore the people in these areas should also be regarded as freedom fighters and not only those who had been gazetted for death or banishment. 
The President on the recommendation of the Minister of Justice has taken a correct decision which was brewing over for years. The first ball rolled in recent times was made by then Miniser of Heritage Affairs Vijitha Herath under the Chandrika Kumaanatunge government. He was at the Keppetipola Commemoration day during that year, when he made the remark that a traitor stigma of the Maha Adikaram should be removed. It did not reach the light of day, as a number of questions were brought before the government of the day as to how it could be done. 


Thus, it was left to President Maithripala Sirisena to step into this void and make it a reality. It is a fitting tribute to sign this de-gazette or whatever you may call it, the document under the seal of State at the Audience Hall or Magul Maduwa. The President has taken a bold step, making way for the peoples of Uva and Sabaragamuwa to call themselves Freedom fighters of the Nation. 
Asgiri Maha Vihare has always fought for the rights of the people. This Maha Vihare did not take any active role in the so called  Treaty  , but kept away from it . They were not a party. 
In passing, it is important to remember that when Late Madam Prime Minister Sirimavo Bandaranaike was deprived of her civic rights during the reign of the government of J.R. Jayawardene, the person who came forward to protect her rights was Enabler Palipanne Chandananda Thera.
He was a stalwart of the ideology of the United National Party but that did not deter him from spearheading to safeguard the rights of a woman whose stature is even now spoken above all others.
What did President J.R. Jayawardene do He directed the Government Agent A.B. Damunupola to take over the land which once housed the Carpentry complex of the Department of Labour, if I am correct, which had been vested with Asgiriya Maha Vihare. It is on this land which now sits the Pallipanne International Centre.
The land was gazetted and taken over by the government, which was once donated to the Mahanayake of Asgiriya. 
The hole from which a British soldier shot into the Vihare 

To make a long story short, the period came when the then Crown Prince and Princess of Japan was to visit the country and it was the same President who was to escort the Royal couple. They were to attend an exposition of the Sacred Relic as well. Then Late President J.R. Jayawardene realised the gravity of the situation. Should the Mahanayke refuse to attend the exposition, the Royal couple would be deprived of the most looked-forward-to event - the exposition of the Sacred Relic. Had the Mahanayake, Venerable Palipanne Chandananda refused to attend the exposition, they would have been deprived to view the Sacred Tooth Relic because the key to this inner casket was with the Maha Vihare of Asgiri. So he was in constant contact with the Government Agent of Kandy A.B. Dammunupola, whose breed is yet to be seen in contemporary administrators. A man who could speak face-to-face with politicians because he had no gain. So a jittery President continually used to ask the Government Agent whether the Asgiri Mahanayake would open the doors for the Exposition.
The government Agent assured the President. It became a headache to the Government Agent as he was continuallyseeking confirmation. 

"To make a long story short, the period came when the then Crown Prince and Princess of Japan was to visit the country and it was the same President who was to escort the Royal couple"

At this point it should be brought to the notice of the reader that the inner shrine room of the Sri Dalada Maligawa is the right of the two Chapters of Asgiri and Malwatta, where the Diyawadana Nilame plays only second fiddle. 
So on the day of the exposition to the Royal couple, the Mahanayake of Asgiriya came to the Sri Dalada Maligawa, as the custodian of the sixth key to bring out the Sacred Tooth Relic. The exposition was over. On the way out of the Sri Dalada Maligawa, President J.R. Jayawardene before entering into the vehicle, told GA Damunupola to give that land back to the Mahanayake  This was only to portray that the clergy
was not petty. They always stand for the rights of the people, though most do not.  So Venerable Kadhapola Thera, though being convicted wrongly as a traitor, should be published as a hero of the nation for shedding blood to free the country of foreign yoke.
