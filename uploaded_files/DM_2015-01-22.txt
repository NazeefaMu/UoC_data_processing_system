Coup allegations are baseless: Gota
	
	Former Defense Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa rejected allegations of an attempt being made by the Rajapaksa regime to subvert democracy through an election night coup and said they would not have called in the Attorney General if such a plan was being actually hatched at Temple Trees.
	Yes, the Attorney General was called to Temple Trees but that was to discuss the matter of maintaining law and order such as whether it was necessary to impose a curfew, etc. because the Opposition had publicly stated that it will surround Temple Trees. That was a situation that needed to be addressed, he said in an interview with Daily Mirror.
	Mr. Rajapaksa said therefore there was a need to put in place certain measures and provide instructions on the maintenance of law and order during the post-election period.
	He said the AG, the IGP and the service commanders were present at the Temple Trees.
	The AG is entitled to advise the government and if there was an attempt to stage a coup, do you think the AG would have been consulted Mr. Rajapaksa asked adding that these allegations about a coup was false and baseless and was being publicized to discredit the former President and other officials.
	Its nothing more than a political witch-hunt because its very clear that no such thing took place; even before all the results were announced the President and all his staff left Temple Trees, he added. (Lakna Paranamanna)

	The government had not exactly done what it promised, Jathika Nidahas Peramuna (JNP) said today commenting on the fuel price reduction, JNP Leader Wimal Weerawansa told a media briefing that that those who were running the government had not kept its pledge to take away taxes on fuel though the prices were reduced.
	This regime promised to slash taxes during the elections but had failed to do so, he said while recalling that the taxes on fuel were under heavy criticism by those who were in office today.
	Mr. Weerrawansa said the fuel price reduction was a result of a temporary situation in the world.
	Therefore, he said, global fuel prices reduction was a result of a tactic followed by the USA to keep price low in order to pressurize Russia.
	He said it was difficult to predict as to how long the global fuel prices stand low in such a situation.
	Meanwhile, he also criticized the calls for the resignation of Chief Justice Mohan Peiris.
	He said there were certain legal formalities to remove him.
	One could bring in a motion to Parliament seeking the impeachment of the Chief Justice if he is not fit to hold the post, he said.
	Weeawansa said the present government had failed to keep its promise to keep the Cabinet to 25 members by appointing 29 Cabinet Ministers, 11 State ministers and 13 Deputy Ministers.
	He questioned the statement made by the Minister of Foreign Affairs Mangala Samaraweera who had said that the North would be demilitarized.
	Is the government going to close down military camps in the North, he asked. (Yohanh Perera and Sanath Desmond)Video by Sanath Desmond

The present regime has no intention of going on a witch hunt but it will take against anyone proved to have been involved in fraud or corruption, said Mr. Ruwan Wijewardene, the State Minister for Defence yesterday.
Mr. Wijewardene who spoke to journalists at Mihindu Seth Medura in Attidiya, where disabled soldiers are cared for, said reports on the investigations regarding the arms ship and the arms discovered at the BMICH would be handed over to the President and the Prime Minister shortly.
He said many persons had phoned him and made allegations  some true, and some false.
Mr. Wijewardene said the armed forces would not be moved from the North as they were needed there.
He said the development work begun by the previous regime would not be stopped. He said would begin making field visits tomorrow to inspect the welfare facilities provided for the forces in the North. I will undertake field visits all over the country and see what the welfare facilities for the forces are, he said.
Mr. Wijewardene spoke to the disabled soldiers and inquired about their wellbeing and about the shortcomings at the Medura. Most of the inmates were satisfied with the facilities but some wanted transport to travel to and from the establishment. Some wanted their housing problems resolved saying they and their families need shelter.(Yohan Perera and Sanath Desmond)Video by Sanath Desmond
