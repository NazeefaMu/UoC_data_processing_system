Philippines threatened to be pulled out of UN
	
MANILA, AFP, Aug 21, 2016 - President Rodrigo Duterte threatened on Sunday to withdraw the Philippines from the United Nations, as he launched another profanity-laced tirade against the organisation for criticising his bloody war on crime.
More than 1,500 people have been killed since Duterte took office and immediately began his law-and-order crackdown, according to police statistics, triggering fierce criticism from the UN and rights groups.
Duterte, a lawyer famous for an acid tongue who has repeatedly told the UN not to interfere, on Sunday stepped up his rhetoric against the organisation.
?Maybe we'll just have to decide to separate from the United Nations. If you are that disrespectful, son of a whore, then I will just leave you,? Duterte said in a press conference in his home city of Davao.

## Title: Probe into admission of SL Tamil children to Indian school

Probe into admission of SL Tamil children to Indian school
	
The future of 55 Sri Lankan Tamil children aged between 11 and 18 hangs in the balance as the Kancheepuram district administration has launched a probe into complaints that they were falsely labelled as refugees and war survivors to get admission in government and private schools at Acharapakkam in the district.
There are 21 girls in this distressed group. Kancheepuram sub-collector V Anbu Selvan told Deccan Chronicle that he, along with a child welfare committee (CWC) member named Zaheeruddin Mohamed inspected a house at Acharapakkam, about 35 km southwest of Chennai, on Saturday to check on the latter?s allegation that several kids were being kept there without proper documents and sans approval from the CWC.
?The facility is being run by an NGO called Bright Society, which earlier administered a free residential school near Bengaluru for Sri Lankan refugee children. They have shown us some papers, which we are scrutinising. But the question is how did this society get these children? Did they follow norms?? he wondered.
The official, however, assured that no action would be taken to disrupt the education of the hapless kids admitted by the NGO into one private and one government school.
It appears that the private school had told the NGO to take away the wards as they did not get the transfer certificates on being shifted from the schools in Bengaluru.
?There was a small delay in getting the TCs for our children but now we have all the papers with us and there should be no problem in the school taking the children back. We are sure the district administration too will appreciate our situation,? said Bright Society secretary G. Gnanadeepan.
According to him, the NGO was running the Indira Gandhi International Academy School near Bengaluru since 1990 to provide quality education, free of fees, for 223 Sri Lankan Tamil refugees. However, paucity of funds forced the Trust to wind up operations and send back all but 55 of the kids to their families living in the various refugee camps in TN.
?These remaining 55 children have are either orphans or from single-parent homes, so we have decided to keep them in this temporary shelter at Acharapakkam. As we are keen on ensuring they did not lose out on their education, we admitted them to two schools there,? Gnanadeepan said.
Interestingly, Bright Society and Indira Gandhi International Academy School were founded by Gnanadeepan's father, Gnanapiragasam Gnanasegeram alias Paranthan Rajan, founder-member, Eelam National Democratic Liberation Front (ENDLF), which had supported the Indo-Lanka Accord of July 1987 and was a constituent ? with two ministers ? in the northeast provincial government headed by EPRLF?s Varadarajaperumal. With the LTTE branding him a 'traitor' and putting him on the hit-list, Rajan chose to spend most of his time with his Bangalore school.
He had earlier tried to start the school in Tamil Nadu but the state government would not permit it. On the other hand, the Karnataka government helped with some funds but after the Rajiv Gandhi assassination, that dried up and the NGO found it tough to find food and facilities for its children.

SEOUL, AFP, Aug 21, 2016 - South Korea warned Sunday of possible North Korean assassinations and kidnappings in revenge for recent high-profile defections to the South.
With tensions also high before a large-scale South Korea-US military exercise starting Monday, the Unification Ministry in Seoul said Pyongyang was bent on provocation.
A ministry official told reporters the defection to Seoul of North Korea's deputy ambassador to Britain and his family had put the North in ?a very difficult situation?.

UN denies report SL temple may lose heritage tag
	
The UN's cultural agency has denied reports it is considering taking an ancient Sri Lankan cave temple off a list of world heritage sites, as a local conservation official Saturday renewed fears about its status.
On a visit to the island last week, UNESCO Director-General Irina Bokova told reporters she had raised concerns over the maintenance of the Golden Temple of Dambulla with local authorities.
However, Bokova's office later stressed she did not say the centuries-old monastery risked being removed from the list of World Heritage Sites, but rather that UNESCO is in dialogue with Sri Lankan authorities over the temple's condition.
"The Office of the Director-General reiterates that the Organization is engaged in a process of dialogue with national authorities on this matter, and that no reference was ever made to its delisting as a World Heritage Site," the statement released Thursday said.
Sri Lanka's top official in charge of heritage conservation told AFP Saturday he believed the Dambulla temple was in fact in danger of being removed from the list owing to decades of neglect.
"The temple risks losing the World Heritage status for two reasons. One is the new constructions that have been added and the second is the damage to murals and the failure to conserve them," Prishanta Gunawardhana, the head of the government's Central Cultural Fund told AFP.
A resident monk had for more than two decades denied conservation officials full access to the temple but a recent change of chief priest had given authorities hope the decline could be stopped, Gunawardhana said.
"This is a national tragedy. We will take at least five months to assess the damage caused by years of neglect," Gunawardhana said.

US Embassy in Colombo had rejected Northern Province Chief Minister C.V. Vigneswaran?s request to conduct medical checks to verify whether ex-LTTE carders in custody, were allegedly injected with a poisonous drug, TNA Provincial Councillor M. K. Shivajilingam said today.
He said Chief Minister C.V. Vigneswaran had requested American Ambassador Athul Keshap to carry out medical tests by American doctors on ex-LTTE carders.
According to him, the Chief Minister had made the request on August 16, when Ambassador Athul Keshap visited medical clinics conducted by doctors attached to the US Air Force for the general public in the Northern Province.
The America Embassy informed that the American doctors were unable to fulfil the request because they did not have enough facilities to conduct such medical tests, he said. (Romesh Madushanka)

KUNDUZ, AFP, Aug 21, 2016 - Afghan forces have recaptured a district that had fallen briefly to the Taliban, officials and residents said Sunday, after thousands of people fled their homes in Afghanistan's northeastern Kunduz province.
Khan Abad district, which is around 30 kilometres east of Kunduz city -- the provincial capital where militants last year scored their biggest ever victory -- had fallen to the Taliban after they launched a pre-dawn attack on the district centre on Saturday, according to local officials.
Several hours later Afghan special forces were deployed to the area -- a key route to Kunduz city -- to retake the district.
The district was recaptured by government forces on Saturday evening, according to Sayed Mahmood Danish, a Kunduz governor spokesman.

Bombing at wedding kills at least 30 in Turkey
	
A bomb attack targeting an outdoor wedding party in southeastern Turkey killed at least 30 people and wounded 94 others, the Turkey authorities said Sunday.
Deputy Prime Minister Mehmet Simsek said the ?barbaric? attack in the city of Gaziantep, near the border with Syria, on Saturday appeared to be a suicide bombing. Other officials said it could have been carried out by either Kurdish militants or Islamic State extremists.
Photographs taken after the explosion showed several bodies covered with white sheets as a crowd gathered nearby.
Early on Sunday, the Gaziantep governor?s office raised the death toll to 30 from 22. It said the number of wounded remained at 94.
Turkey has been rocked by a wave of attacks in the past year that have been claimed by Kurdish militants linked to the outlawed Kurdistan Workers? Party ? known by its acronym, P.K.K. ? or have been attributed to the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL. In June, assailants suspected of being Islamic State militants attacked Istanbul?s main airport with guns and bombs, killing more than 40 people.
The attack on the wedding came as the country was still reeling from a failed coup attempt last month, which the government has accused Fethullah Gulen, a Muslim cleric based in the United States, and his followers of plotting.
Earlier this week, a string of bombings blamed on the P.K.K. that targeted the police and soldiers killed at least a dozen people. A fragile peace between the group and the government collapsed last year, leading to a resumption of the three-decade conflict.
In an interview with NTV television, Mr. Simsek called the bombing a ?barbaric attack? and said multiple terrorist groups were targeting Turkey. ? God willing, we will overcome,? he said.
Mr. Simsek later went to Gaziantep along with the country?s health minister to visit the wounded and see the site of the attack.
?This is a massacre of unprecedented cruelty and barbarism,? he told reporters there.
He said it was too soon to say who was behind the attack.
Prime Minister Binali Yildirim condemned the bombing, saying it had turned ?a wedding party into a place of mourning.?
?No matter what this treacherous terror organization is called, we as the people, the state, and the government will pursue our determined struggle against it,? he said.
A brief statement from the governor?s office in Gaziantep said the bombing struck the wedding in the Sahinbey district at 10:50 p.m. The statement condemned the ?treacherous? attack, but did not provide additional details.
Mehmet Tascioglu, a local journalist, said on NTV television that a huge explosion could be heard in many parts of the city.
In Gaziantep, the police sealed off the site of the attack and forensic teams began investigating. Hundreds of residents gathered near the site, chanting ?God is great? as well as slogans denouncing terrorist attacks.

Northern people want Navy to remain in the North: Ganesan
	
The people in the North want the Navy to remain there in order to prevent the South Indian fishermen from encroaching into Sri Lankan waters, a Tamil politician said today.
Minister of National Integration, Reconciliation and Languages Mano Ganesan, who was the chief guest at the launch of the Sinhala translation of International Human Rights Charter by Hemachnadra Pathirana in Colombo said the Northern people whom he met recently had informed him that they want the Navy to remain in the North.
?When I visited the North recently the people there want the Navy to remain. When I asked them why they said this is because the Navy could prevent the South Indian fishermen from stealing fish from Sri Lankan waters,? the Minister said.
?I think the country should be aware of these sentiments of the Northern people,? he added.
?At the same time the Minister said the members of the security forces who had done wrong should be penalised. ?A Security Force in any country when engaged in a war tends to commit offences. The Indian Peace Keeping Forces also committed offences and so did the American forces in countries such as Iraq. Also few members of the Sri Lankan security forces have also committed wrong doings in the war,? he said
?Therefore those members of the Sri Lankan security forces who had done wrong should be penalised. One cannot disperse the army or penalise the entire force just because some have done wrong. You don?t dissolve Parliament just because few MPs are corrupt,? the Minister further said.
Minister Ganesan said some including the then former President Mahinda Rajapaksa are talking of betraying the Sri Lankan security forces today forgetting what he did in the past. He said it was the former President who went to Geneva calling for action against the disappearances and killings in 1987/89. The Minister said former President actually went to Geneva against the security forces.
Mr. Ganesan was critical of the TNA MPs as well stating that they fled the country during the last regime without fighting for rights. ?It was I who fought against extra judicial killings and disappearances together with some Sinhalese leaders when all the TNA MPs fled the country,? he said.

In the backdrop of American military doctors giving medical care in the North, the National University Teachers? Association (NUTA) queried today whether these foreign medical practitioners obtained ?ethical clearance permission? from the authorised bodies in Sri Lanka to collect blood samples of Sri Lankan citizens.
NUTA President Dr. Channa Jayasumana told Daily Mirror his Association learnt of measures by these American doctors to collect blood samples of some ex LTTE combatants to determine whether they had been injected with poisonous substance during rehabilitation process.
Dr. Jayasumana, a senior lecturer of Rajarata Medical Faculty, said blood samples of individuals should be collected, for other than treatment purposes, only with ethical clearance permission.
?I direct this question at Sri Lanka Medical Council and the Health Ministry to let the country know whether it was done,? he said.
He said nobody knew whether blood samples of Sri Lankan citizens would be collected in this manner for genetic studies or anything. (Kelum Bandara)
