6000 year grains unearthed
	
A team of researchers from the Archaeological Faculty of the Kelaniya University lead by Prof. Raj Somadewa has discovered a kind of grains of more than 6000 years during excavations on the Ilukkumbura area in Balangoda which was the seat of an ancient civilization.
Prof, Somadewa said it was evident that the staple diet of the earliest inhabitants of the county comprised of rice, herbs and fruits. He pointed out that the kind of paddy he discovered had evolved into the present varieties of paddy cultivated in the country. He refused the notion that the variety of paddy cultivated in Sri Lanka had an Indian origin.
We discovered several kinds of grains including paddy, during excavations. We referred specimens to the Beta Analytics Corporation in Florida for laboratory tests to determine the chronology. They have reported that the history of paddy runs as far back as 4350BC. It is evident that the pre-historic man who lived about 6000 years ago had given up hunting and switched to vegetarian diet. The varieties of paddy might have been improved later into the present varieties, he said.
He also said the botanists in Colombo were not in a position to identify the grains. However the Beta Analytics Corporation had sent their report in two weeks. He said that his team would carry out further research on all wild paddy and other seeds. (Prince Ratnayake)

Ex-LG heads planning new political party
	
Some former heads of local authorities which were administered by the United Peoples Freedom Alliance (UPFA) are in the process of forming a new political party to contest the Local Government elections with the backing of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa.
Former Gampaha Pradeshiya Sabha Chairman Ranjith Gunawardane he and some others met yesterday to lay the ground plan for the new political party. He said they met Mr. Rajapaksa before their meeting.
The Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) is on a politically downhill path after some MPs took up posts in the government. So, we have to resurrect the party by forming a new front to accommodate party cadres, Mr. Gunawardene said.
He said the name of the party and its symbol would be announced after elections were declared. The government has said the elections would be held this year under a mix system of Proportional Representation System and the First-Past-the-Post-System.
Meanwhile, the joint opposition is also known to be throwing its weight behind the new party. Its national organizer and MP Prasanna Ranatunga said the joint opposition would consider a new political alternative at this point of time.(Kelum Bandara)

Sri Lankas domestic mechanism would be a Sri Lankan process with an international element, visiting British Minister of State at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, Hugo Swire said today. 

Speaking of Sri Lankas commitment made in Geneva in September, Swire stated the government was amidst making several proposals for the mechanism, which were most likely to be reviewed and discussed with the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Raad al Hussein during his visit to Sri Lanka this year. 

There is a lot of work going on to come up with some kind of solution to get things going. It will be a Sri Lankan process with an international element, but what that means remains to be discussed and seen. It is not an international system that is being imposed on Sri Lanka, Swire said during a press conference at the end of his three day visit.
 
The British Minister who visited the Northern Province said there was some concern about the pace of land held by the military being returned.

Even though a considerable amount of land has been released to civilians, there are huge expectations from this government to move quicker. The pace of land being returned will accelerate in the future. I believe the land that is returned should be in good condition, which will allow normal community lives to start up again, he said. 

Swire also promised Britains assistance in addressing international issues on human and labour rights, several criterias which needed to be fulfilled, before the country applied for the European GSP scheme.

Britain was eager to re-engage in the Defence sector, where it would provide the Sri Lankan armed forces training on how to operate within a democratic system.
Discussions with the Prime Minister also revealed the Sri Lankan forces would take an initiative in international peacekeeping in the future.

Swire also welcomed the governments intention to sign up to the Ottawa convention on demining.(Nabeela Hussain)

Pakistan, Sri Lanka eye $1bn trade
	
Pakistan and Sri Lanka are striving to boost the bilateral trade to $1 billion from the current $325 million, Pakistan Commerce Minister Khurram Dastgir said yesterday while inaugurating the three-day single-country exhibition in Colombo, along with his counterpart Sri Lankan Minister for Industry Rishad Bathiuddin.
This was stated by the Commerce Minister Khurram Dastgir while inaugurating the three-day single-country exhibition in Colombo, along with his counterpart Sri Lankan Minister for Industry Rishad Bathiuddin on Friday.
An official statement of the ministry said that the exhibition would showcase Pakistani brands in engineering, auto parts, agro food, textile and clothing, designer wear, handicrafts and traditional textiles, cosmetics and herbal products, pharmaceuticals, gems and jewellery, carpets and marble.
The soft launch of the fair, organised by the Trade Development Authority of Pakistan and the High Commission of Pakistan, was performed by the prime minister in Sri Lanka earlier this month.
The exhibition is a key step to materialise the target of increasing the bilateral trade to $1bn.
Negotiations have already started to expand the existing Free Trade Agreement (FTA) to trade in services and investment.
Technical level meetings have detailed out the basic framework for inclusion of new subjects in the FTA.
Pakistan has also sought to enhance the export quota of rice to Sri Lanka from the current 6,000 to 10,000 metric tonnes, response on which is still awaited.
Speaking at the ceremony, Dastgir said that the fair would carve out new business partnerships, strengthen the old ones and enhance trade and commerce between the two countries.(Dawn)

Port city project to resume: SL ambassador to China
	
The green light has been given to the delayed Colombo Port City project, the Sri Lankan ambassador to China confirmed on Friday.
A financial hub connecting South Asia, Southeast Asia and the Middle East is expected to be set up in the Colombo Port City, said Karunasena Kodituwakku, Sri Lankan ambassador to China in an exclusive interview with China Daily.
The $1.4 billion urban complex project will cover 233 hectares adjoining the Port of Colombo. The deal was initially signed between the Sri Lankan government and the China Communications Construction Co in November 2013.
However, it was suspended by the Sri Lankan government early in 2015 after Maithripala Sirisena became the country's president.
A greater environmental impact assessment to allay public concern was needed, which was "not the fault of the Chinese company", reiterated Kodituwakku, the ambassador.
The "incremental environmental impact" by the project is "minimal/negligible at the reclamation site and the coastal zone to the North and South of the site," said an environmental impact assessment report released by the Sri Lankan authorities in December.
"The project will create employment, create tax income, and create indirect opportunity for other services. ... Everybody will benefit," said the Ambassador.
Colombo Port City will become "a high-end urban complex in South Asia concentrating industries, including finance, tourism, logistics and information technology," and the whole project will create more than 80,000 jobs, said China's Ministry of Commerce in November 2013. (China Daily)

## Title: SL keen on India's help for quicker voluntary repatriation

SL keen on India's help for quicker voluntary repatriation
	
		 		 
		 
			
With one more batch of Sri Lankan Tamil refugees returning from Tamil Nadu to their motherland in a few days, the Sri Lankan government is keen on getting assistance of the Indian government to enable quicker voluntary repatriation of the remaining refugees.

We would like the Indian government to help us with regard to housing and road development in places of resettlement, V.Sivagnanasothy, according to Secretary, Ministry of Prison Reforms, Rehabilitation, Resettlement and Hindu Religious Affairs in the Sri Lankan government.

On Tuesday, 41 refugees including 26 women, will reach Colombo from Chennai and Madurai. A senior official in Chennai says: Of late, on an average, 60 persons are returning to Sri Lanka every month compared to 30 or 40 persons in the past.

To facilitate the repatriation, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees provides free air tickets; reintegration allowance of US$ 75 per person; transport allowance US$ 19 per person and monitory non-food grant of US$ 75 per family. The baggage allowance has been increased from 40 kg to 60 kg per person.

A former official of the Rehabilitation Department in the Tamil Nadu government says that if ferry services are resumed early between Talaimannar in the Northern Province and Rameswaram in Tamil Nadu, the number of refugees going back will be much more. Except for a few statements made in the last one year on the resumption of ferry services, there appears to be no tangible progress.

Pointing out that about 1.37 lakh houses are required to be built in the Northern and Eastern Provinces of Sri Lanka, Mr. Sivagnanasothy says the Ministry has prepared a comprehensive project for providing livelihood assistance to those refugees who return home. Under the project, the food component envisages the provision of food for six months. In this regard, the World Food Programme has been approached. In case our project does not get covered under the Food Programme, we will provide dry ration for three months from our budgetary allocation, the official says.

Of 46,000 houses to be built with the Indian governments assistance in the two provinces, 43,800 houses were completed as on December 31, 2015 including 15,878 houses in 2015. The remaining 2,200 houses are expected to be covered in the next few months, says the Indian High Commission in Colombo.

Mr. Sivagnanasothy said that his Ministry will award contracts shortly for a project of building 65,000 houses in the two provinces. While 11,000 houses will be built in the first year, the next three years will see the construction of 18,000 houses each year.
As for the number of Sri Lankan Tamil refugees living in Tamil Nadu, there appears to be lack of clarity. While the Tamil Nadu government and the Sri Lankan authorities say there are over 1,00,000 refugees are living in the State including non-camp refugees, the annual report of the Union Ministry of Home Affairs for 2014-2015 states that as on December 31, 2014, there were about 65,000 refugees living in 110 camps including one in Odisha and 15,000 refugees living outside the camps.(The Hindu)

## Title: SL peace process would have benefitted from greater int'l Effort-Solheim

SL peace process would have benefitted from greater int'l Effort-Solheim
	
		 		 
		 
			
A broader international commitment would have ensured the success of an effort to end an over two-decade-long war between the Sri Lankan military and Tamil separatists, Erik Solheim, a former peace negotiator, said at the Atlantic Council on January 14.
In the absence of such a commitment, the Sri Lankan military continued a fierce offensive against the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) fighters as ceasefire agreements between the warring sides collapsed. In May of 2009, the government announced that it had defeated the separatists, bringing the curtain down on a 26-year war. More than 100,000 people are believed to have lost their lives, at least 40,000 of them in the wars final days.
India, Japan, and Norway offered diplomatic and logistical support during the effort to broker peace between the Sri Lankan government and the LTTE. But, Solheim said, a broader and stronger coalition of outside international players was needed.
Solheim, a Norwegian politician and former chief negotiator in the Sri Lankan peace process, participated in a panel discussion hosted by the Atlantic Councils South Asia Center. Richard L. Armitage, who has served as Deputy Secretary of State in the George W. Bush administration; and Mark Salter, author of To End a Civil War, which recounts the mediation efforts in Sri Lanka, were also part of the panel. Bharath Gopalaswamy, Director of the Atlantic Councils South Asia Center moderated the discussion.
Until its full disbandment in 2009, the LTTE was a highly effective militant organization that specialized in using terror tactics to execute its secessionist operations against the Sri Lankan government. Solheim led a team of negotiators in 2002 to oversee ceasefire talks that broke down in 2006.
In dealing with such an entrenched, polarized, and drawn-out conflict, Solheim said patience was paramount from the first day on the ground: Only if you can be patient and accept that there will be ups and downs then you can potentially have some impact on the path to peace.
Solheim identified specific challenges surrounding the diplomatic missionnamely, the dearth of information his team had on dealing with senior officials in both the Sri Lankan government and the LTTE. We needed a bigger team to tap into Tamil-Sinhala relationships and more importantly, we needed to gain insight into the unique leadership of the Tamil Tigers, he said. At the end of the day it was about this.
A broader coalition of international players would have also helped this effort, he added.
Armitage said constant antagonism and negligence from senior Sri Lankan and LTTE leaders prevented the peace process from seriously progressing. The lesson from Sri Lanka for all of us is that you cant want peace more than the participant parties want peace, he said.
Further, Armitage discussed the importance of engaging all parties in diplomatic discussions despite their combat tactics. Salter agreed. For all the political rhetoric against engaging terrorist groups in diplomatic discussion, the reality on the ground...for this particular conflict was that was precisely what was required, said Salter. In the end, the Norwegian-sponsored peace mission depended on bipartisan unity between the government and the LTTE. In order to achieve this unity, more legitimate engagement with the LTTE leadership needed to occur, he noted.
While Solheim, Armitage, and Salter agreed on maintaining contextual priorities throughout the Sri Lankan peace mediation, they all understood crosscutting political engagement and proper expertise as cornerstones for civil conflict resolution.
The idea of political settlementis about applying international pressure, diplomatic expertise, and foreign assistance, said Salter.
The Sri Lankan army has been accused of committing mass murder of civilians during the war. A United Nations panel of experts found that multiple sources of information indicate that a range of up to 40,000 civilian deaths cannot be ruled out in the wars final days. A Sri Lankan government estimate, however, put the figure at around 9,000.
Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa appointed a Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission to look into the allegations against the military. The commission cleared the military of any wrongdoing, a conclusion Amnesty International dismissed as flawed.
Rajapaksas successor, Maithripala Sirisena, has, however, been credited with advancing the reconciliation process since the end of the war. On Sirisenas first anniversary in office this month, United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said he is encouraged by the government's commitment to a broad reform agenda that aims to realize durable peace, stability and prosperity for the Sri Lankan people.
Despite the ramifications of the failed peace process, including allegations of government corruption and potential war crimes, Solheim remains optimistic.
We are now in the most hopeful time in modern Sri Lankan history...There has never been a better chance at getting it right, he said.
