A new initiative to reconcile the Big Two
	
	
	A new initiative has been launched to bring about reconciliation between the deposed one and the Compassionate One.
The main actor behind the new initiative is said to be a Buddhist monk who once vowed to defeat the strongman and later worked hard to make good the vow. The monk is being assisted by a prominent political commentator who once played a double role in the media field.
The monk said to be unhappy over the peace overtures being made to the Tamil rights diehards by this government has already sounded the Betel leaf rebels on his initiative. Meanwhile, the political commentator who has now lost both roles had met the deposed strongman at the residence of the latters younger sibling. At these talks, the media person had on behalf of the monk submitted a formula for reconciliation which envisages both parties taking a step backwards from their present stiff stands. The former strongman has given his nod to this formula.
The media person is expected to continue to function as the shuttle - emissary until the one-on-one meeting between the Big Two takes place, they say.

A prediction by a reluctant royal astrologer: Stormy times are ahead!
	
	
	The royal astrologer who had to see stars when he discovered on the D-day last January that he had misread the stars, has now confined his practice to reading personal horoscopes
The other day a high political authority of the yahapalanaya government had called on the royal astrologer and asked him to make a prediction about the outcome of the coming general election. But the royal astrologer had told him that he had stopped practicing Mundane Astrology  that is making forecasts about political and natural events in store for countries and their political leaders. After much coaxing and cajoling he had come out with a prognostication for the future of the political leaders and a rough estimate of the showing of each main political party at the coming general election.
Doesnt this mean that a stormy period is ahead for our country was the government authoritys response which had sounded more as a statement than a question. As he walked up to his waiting car, the political authority had his head bent low as if it was weighed down by heavy thoughts, they say.

Another story about another pair of shoes of another kid of a VIP
	
	Once upon a time the news that a brat of a VVIP had gone in for a pair of shoes worth its weight in gold created a sensation in political circles and the public domain and the media pouncing on the news tore up the brat into shreds.
Political opponents of the VVIP grabbed this news as ideal grist to their propaganda mill.
Meanwhile, a story about a much more expensive pair of shoes  valued at one lakh short of one million rupees or the worth of the pair of VVIPs son six times over- acquired by a kid of a yahapalanaya ministerial one is making rounds in political circles these days. The purchase, they say, had been made by the kid when he accompanied his dad on an official visit to a foreign country.
Incidentally, the ministerial father of the lucky kid was among those who pontificated some time ago that it was a crime to spend tens of thousands on a fancy pair of shoes to satisfy a weird whim when the man in the street could not afford one decent meal a day!

Bangladeshi black money invested in SL- Report
	
Sri Lanka is among many countries where the ill-gotten money of several Bangladeshi politicians are being siphoned off and invested in properties and businesses to ensure a secure future for their families, Bangladesh based Daily Star newspaper reported.
The other major destinations of investing black money from Bangladesh are the UK, the USA, Australia, Singapore, the UAE, Thailand, Nepal and Mauritius.
According to Daily Star, a number of leaders of both the Awami League (AL) and the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) are learned to have secured their future overseas by winning citizenship for their families through investment visas or business migration schemes.
Many politicians from top to mid level have invested in properties abroad. They have made the investments in the names of their wives and children, said an AL central committee member, seeking anonymity.
A minister of the last BNP-led government has made considerable investments in Singapore.Sources close to him had told Daily Star that his son invested in a private port in Sri Lanka.
The Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC) officials say they are investigating money laundering cases that have been on the rise in recent years.
According to the ACC annual report in 2013, the commission received several hundred allegations of money laundering, and investigated 118 cases.

BBS boils over noodles
	
	Sri Lanka was becoming the largest garbage food dump in Asia because the food items imported were usually unsuitable for human consumption, Bodu Bala Sena (BBS) General Secretary Ven. Galagodaatte Gnanasara Thera charged today.
	Addressing the media after visiting the Consumers Affairs Authority (CAA) to inquire on the reports of high levels of lead contents in Maggi brand of noodles, the Thera said the CAA officials had no answers to their questions on the issue.
	We inquired whether the noodle could be pulled out of the market at least temporarily as a precautionary measure, until the reports were released on the test carried out on the lead level. The Multi National food company in India had decided to temporarily take its Maggi noodles off the shelves. Several Indian States had banned the product, which was found to contain high levels of lead, making it unsafe for human consumption, the Thera said.
	He said as a good governance government, it should interfere in this issue without a delay.
	He said it was questionable to have the HALAL certificate for Maggi noodles even in 2015.
	The All Ceylon Jamiyyathul Ulama (ACJU) organization had promised to stop the issuance of HALAL certificate for foods. However, today, the HALAL certification is issued as HAC (Halal Accreditation Council), the Thera said.
	He questioned the authorities to look into how the ACJU was given approval to issue the certificate, to obtain money to issue the certificate and what facilities they had to check on the levels of lead in food items. (Chaturanga Pradeep)WATCHPix by Waruna Wanniarachchi

City hawkers to get IDs
	
Street vendors, who have been given permission by the Colombo Municipal Council (CMC) to set up their stalls, would be given an identification card to operate, Colombo Mayor A.J.M. Muzammil said yesterday.
Reiterating that he did not give permission for street vending to take place in all parts of Colombo, he said that permission was given for street vendors only on certain pavements in Pettah.
If street vendors were to set up stalls they are required to produce an ID issued by the CMC. Till a permanent solution is found we have given permission for the vendors only along the by-roads of First Cross Street, the Second Cross Street and Third Cross Street in Pettah to carry out their businesses during the Ramadhan season, he said.
Muzammil said that a decision to issue identification cards was made because street vendors sell the stalls given by the CMC and continue to operate elsewhere without paying their due rates to the municipality.
With the upcoming elections there was a lot of interference by political parties to provide a comprehensive solution for the vendors. Now however it has been sorted and we are carrying out discussions with the relevant authorities to find a permanent solution once the Ramadhan season is over, he said. (Rumana Razick)

The Kachcheri had once been a very familiar place for him because in his youth he had had occasion to call here in his official capacity to meet several Government Agents who headed it from time to time.
	
	
	The conference over, the New Boss went round the Kachcheri and came to a brief stop at the Finance Division. Here he took a walk down his memory lane. It was a chaotic time that followed the 1977 general election which inflicted a bitter defeat on the SLFP- led government, he recalled. At that time, I was serving as a Grama Niladhari. I called at the Kachcheri and I was making it to this Division to collect some payments due to me when a friend warned me: Dont go any further. There is a group waiting to hammer you. Turn back and run for your life. I immediately rushed out of the Kachcheri, mounted my push bike and rode off like mad!

I was not contacted over charges against Kshenuka: Kunanayakam
	
	Despite being a key person who brought the Genevagate controversy before the public, former diplomat Tamara Kunanayakam says no testimony was obtained from her and neither was she contacted by the investigator who recently concluded the probe on the contentious audit report relating to the issue.
	Kunanayakam speaking to Daily Mirror said she was much surprised by the fact that no statement was obtained from her, despite her being the official who requested an audit on the refurbishment of the official residence of Sri Lanka's Permanent Representative to Geneva.
	She also explained that when she met the then president, Mahinda Rajapaksa on the occasion of her visit to Sri Lanka at the behest of the then foreign minister to interact with the Latin American Ambassadors to Sri Lanka who were attending the National Day celebrations, she had orally requested the president to conduct an independent audit into financial irregularities and security lapses at the Permanent Mission.
	Kunanayakam said she could not expect an unbiased probe given that Senevirathne was serving at the time as the Additional Secretary of the MFA -- and it was public knowledge that the Ministry was being run by the former Monitoring MP of External Affairs, Sajin Vass Gunawardena -- a close associate of Senevirathne.
	Although her request for an independent audit was described as a violation of stipulated procedure, Kunanayakam said another reason for her directly approaching the then president on the matter was because it concerned security, which came under the purview of the president.
	She noted that by then she had already received several threats from the LTTE while serving in Cuba as Ambassador, due to her having prevented the establishment of an LTTE network in Latin America and during her tenure as Sri Lanka's Permanent Representative to Geneva. She had been informed by the security officers that they had observed suspicious movements - a fact that had been confirmed by the Swiss Police. She had also received an anonymous threatening letter from Canada during that time.
	"So under these circumstances was it wrong for me to have to have spoken to the former president about my concerns and to have requested an independent audit" she asked, adding that the manner in which the latest inquiry has been conducted (without obtaining her testimony and giving a one-sided account) only confirmed the fact that she was right in calling for an independent audit.
	The former diplomat went on to state that various influential members of the present government, who, while they were in the Opposition, accused the Rajapaksa regime of trying to cover up the Genevagate controversy were now attacking her for having taken the right course of action, even going to the extent of falsely accusing her of having helped the Tigers.
	"From the beginning, there has been an attempt to divert attention away from the Audit Report and from the real issues posed by that report. For instance, why was there no inquiry on the Company, despite the recommendation by the Mission Why did the Ministry choose a company that is 400 km away from Geneva, when there are plenty of construction companies in Geneva Why did the Company not submit a proper quotation Why was a Company, which at the time was known for credit, insurance, and real estate, rather than for construction, selected" she asked, while also noting that, although the Audit report which was released in 2012 recommended that immediate attention be given to the security situation, no action had been taken by the MFA on the matter.
	"This and the new report of the MFA investigator shows that the Foreign Ministry is not interested in finding out the truth or in taking action on the Audit report," she said.
	
	
					Meanwhile, responding to the comments made by Kunanayakam, MFA Spokesperson Mahishini Colonne told Daily Mirror that the officer charged with the investigation had only contacted those whose comments were necessary to obtain the facts that he had been instructed to find."He would not have contacted her because of the nature of what he had been requested to investigate. He was asked to inquire into the allegations levelled against Senevirathne in the audit report and, accordingly, he had contacted the officials who performed the audit, and recorded necessary statements from them," she said.
					Colonne further went on to note that, if a management audit was required, there were certain regulations that had to be adhered to, and that the course of action followed by Kunanayakam was in violation of protocol.
					"If her concern was with regard to security, and if that was why she directly approached the president instead of dealing with the matter internally through the MFA, she should have called for a team of intelligence officials - not a team to perform an audit. As I have mentioned before, the audit which should have been performed by officials of the Auditor General's Department was instead performed by a four member team from the Finance Ministry which is once again an anomaly," she said.

	The Indian External Affairs Ministry on Tuesday informed the Madras High Court in Madurai that it has impressed upon the Sri Lankan Navy to act with restraint, not to fire on Indian fishermen and to treat them in a humane manner, the Hindu reported.
	It also said: During India-Sri Lanka bilateral meetings, including those at the highest levels, India has reiterated its position that the use of force could not be justified under any circumstances and that all fishermen should be treated in a humane manner."
	The submissions were made in a counter affidavit filed on behalf of the Ministry and the Indian High Commissioner in Sri Lanka in reply to a habeas corpus petition (HCP) filed to produce three Rameswaram fishermen who had been missing since August 25 last year. Deputy Secretary K.M.P. Sharma had filed the affidavit stating that the three fishermen were not in the custody of the Sri Lankan authorities and hence neither the Ministry nor the High Commissioner could be made accountable with respect to their production in court.
	Pointing out that the fishermen had gone missing while fishing near Delft Island on the Sri Lankan side of the International Maritime Boundary Line (IMBL), Mr. Sharma said that the Sri Lankan Navy could not trace them despite carrying out an extensive search and rescue operation.
	He also said that the names of the three fishermen J. Wilson, J. Daniel and L. Essron did not find place in the list of Indian fishermen who had been detained by the Sri Lankan Navy on charges such as crossing the IMBL.

	He said Colombo branch of the global consultancy firm KPMG had been enlisted to restructure it following discussions with the President, the Prime Minister, and Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake.
	KPMG is expected to find ways to sustain LANKA SATHOSA in a profitable manner, while giving the best market prices to consumers, Minister Bathiudeen said.
	He said LANKA SATHOSA owed Rs. 10 billion to two banks and another Rs. 3 billion to suppliers.
	Minister Bathiudeen said KPMG had already advised the government on streamlining and regularising LANKA SATHOSA administration and added that the government would foot Rs. 7.5 billion pending bills of organisation.
	This Rs. 7.5 billion is an investment by the government to make it competitive on par with private supermarket chains of Sri Lanka, he said.
	He said the newly revived LANKA SATHOSA would be re-launched on July 7.

	Be it Warnasinghe or any other party, anyone can go courts against the festival. If that happens, I will not even seek the assistance of a lawyer, I will represent myself in courts to defend the event, he said addressing the media at the Information Department last morning.
	
	Minister Samaraweera criticised those shed a negative light on the festival simply due to the use of the term Diaspora.
	
	As pointed out many times earlier as well, the term Diaspora does not refer to LTTE activists. It refers to Sri Lankans of all communities and ethnicities who have migrated.
	
	Our invitation is for those among them, who stand for a united Sri Lanka in which the sovereignty and territorial integrity is preserved. We wish to welcome them and to seek their assistance and expertise in rebuilding this country, he said.
	
	The Minister went on to state that it was only a few narrow-minded individuals, who are trying to paint the event in a negative light to mislead the public.
	
	I have mentioned earlier that Tamil extremism and Sinhala extremism are two factors that continue to fuel each other. . . Rudrakumaran and Warnasinghe are two sides of the same coin.
	
	This new government was elected to cast aside such narrow minded attitudes to gain short term political goals and achieve long lasting reconciliation and peace and we believe this event will help pave the way to that goal, he added.(Lakna Paranamanna)

Secret behind shelving his political ambitions
	
	Once there was much speculation that this former white collar defense bigwig was nursing political ambitions and was planning to contest the upcoming general election.
However, recently this bigwig took all and sundry by surprise when he declared that he had no intention of entering electoral politics.
Meanwhile, the inquisitive ones who have been making discreet inquiries had learnt that the onetime white collar bigwig had given up his political ambitions on the advice of his elder sibling who too once held a powerful position which none could challenge.
But what is more interesting is the reason why the former strongman had dissuaded his younger sibling from taking to politics. They say there are two Betel Leaf front-liners who are having nightmares about losing a good part of their preference votes to the former Defense bigwig if he enters the fray. The twosome are said to be leaders of name board parties highly dependent on the Betel Leaf. One of them is a veteran in politics and the other is a big mouth. They had confided their fears in the elder sibling who had promised to hold his ambitious younger sibling in check.

SL a critical partner: US
	
Sri Lanka would be a critical partner in broadening the United States interests across the Indo-Pacific region, US President Barack Obama's ambassadorial nominee for Sri Lanka Atul Keshap told lawmakers on Tuesday. 
"As we look to advance our interests across the Indo- Pacific, Sri Lanka will be a critical partner," Keshap said.
Noting that there is room for closer cooperation on disaster response and maritime security in the Indian Ocean, he said Sri Lanka is a regional leader in the fight against cybercrime, a contributor to UN Peacekeeping Operations and is focused on disrupting drug trafficking and fighting maritime piracy.
Keshap said the US wanted to build lasting peace and fellowship among Sri Lanka's various religious and ethnic groups, PTI said.
"We want to help build a lasting peace and fellowship among Sri Lanka's ethnic and religious communities, including credible justice, accountability and reconciliation that can facilitate closure for those who suffered and lost loved ones during the war," Atul Keshap, the nominee for US Ambassador to Sri Lanka, told members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee during his confirmation hearing.
"It is important to get this right, and the UN and international community can lend useful insight to the efforts of the Sri Lankan people," Keshap said.
If confirmed by the US Senate, Keshap would be the second Indian-American to be serving in an ambassadorial position in South Asia. Richard Verma is the current US envoy to India.
"We want to help the Sri Lankan people strengthen democracy, civil society, and human rights, including media freedom and freedom of religion," he said.
"Economically, the US is Sri Lanka's largest export market. While our trade volume is relatively low, there is great potential to expand our partnership," he said.
On Maldives, Keshap said a young and dynamic populace is on the front lines of climate change.
"We are worried, however, about the current state of rule of law, due process, and human rights (in Maldives). All citizens should be allowed to exercise their human rights and fundamental freedoms," Keshap said.

US report used with ulterior motives: Ruwan
	
	State Minister of Defence Ruwan Wijewardene said that statements portraying danger to national security citing a recent report by the US State Department were baseless and made by persons with ulterior political motives.
	In a release issued to the media, Wijewardene said that elements were using a report of the United States State Department as a base for such false notions.
	The President, the Prime Minister and I have placed utmost diligence in ensuring and furthering national security. There is not an iota of truth in the notion that national security is in danger. Every person who is promoting such notions in doing so with ulterior political motives, the statement said.
	Wijewardene said that the basis of several visits by Foreign Minister Mangala Samaraweera was to ensure the dismantling of this international network.
	The governments foreign policy is aimed at strategically dismantling the terrorist networks world over and the fact that the LTTE ban has been extended in certain countries is an example of the dividends of this strategy, he said.
	Wijewardene further said that the government was studying the report by the State Department and would pay careful attention to its contents in order to ensure that national security was not endangered.

We are also answerable for your actions, the Thera tells him!
	
	There is a prominent Buddhist monk who played a lead role in the campaign to bring the present government to power. It appeared at that time that he firmly believed that the Compassionate One would work on an agenda based principles aimed at ushering in a just society.
A delegation from an association of university dons that worked shoulder to shoulder with the movement led by this Buddhist prelate in the run up to the January 8 big poll recently called on the latter for an exchange of views on the current political situation. During the discussion that ensued, the university dons expressed their grave concern over a series of blunders committed by this government since taking office. They had further appealed to the prelate to request the New Big Boss to set right certain wrongs done by his administration.
The prelate who himself was quite unhappy with the way the affairs of the state were being run had immediately called the New Big Boss over the phone and expressed his deep disappointment over certain commissions and omissions on the part of the regime. He had added: Mahattayo, what are these doings of your government We promised to reduce the number of ministers. But the number of your ministers is steadily increasing. But thats not the only promise you have broken We kindly request you to consider the position we are placed in as well before taking vital decisions. I am making this request in all earnestness because we are also answerable in respect of the promises held out to our voters at the last election!

Why didn't UPFA govt. reform electoral system - Ranil
	
	Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe yesterday asked why the UPFA government had failed to bring in a new electoral system despite enjoying a two-thirds majority.
	Speaking during an adjournment debate in Parliament, Mr. Wickrmesinghe charged that the UPFA government failed to bring in any fruitful constitutional reforms.
	He said the adjournment debate on the 20th Amendment was moved in Parliament in order to allow all parties to voice their opinion with regard to a new electoral system. Allowing all parties to voice their opinions is the ideology of President Maithripala Sirisena, he said.
	Mr. Wickremesinghe said that what Cabinet had done was to compile a document pertaining to electoral reforms so that a broad discussion would be possible.
	He said the report of the select committee headed by MP Dinesh Gunawardene should also be discussed. He said the best loser system suggested by the Dinesh Gunawardene committee should also be considered
	Responding to allegations by the opposition that the UNP was trying to jettison the 20th Amendment, he said it was those who wanted the no confidence motions taken up first who were trying to jettison it. It will take at least a month for parliament to take up the 20th Amendment for debate if the no confidence motions are taken up first, he said.(Yohan Perera and Kelum Bandara)
