Campaigning for votes on ethnic lines will backfire: CaFFE
	
Political parties had not understood the new mixed electoral system properly, election watchdog Campaign For Free and Fair Elections (CaFFE) Executive Director Keerthi Thennakoon said today.
He told the Daily Mirror that in many areas politicians had resorted inciting communal feelings ignoring the composition of the population in their respective wards, as they had done during the previous elections, which were conducted under the Proportional Representation (PR) system.
"Those days they exploited the communal feelings as they wanted to attract voters of their community from all over the respective local government area or the district, whereas now they have to address all communities in the respective wards, which is good in a reconciliation perspective," he stated.
Tennakoon said that his organisation has initiated an awareness programme around the country to educate the candidates contesting the local government elections scheduled to be held on February 10 on the new electoral system.
Some candidates in the north could face repercussions of using the LTTE propaganda materials in their election campaigns, such as the songs used by the LTTE in their propaganda activities.
"Their campaign will be hampered if one candidate is arrested on the grounds that the LTTE propaganda materials they are using are illegal," he stated.
He added that apart from the SLFP which had played LTTE songs at a meeting in Jaffna last Thursday, several other political parties, as well as independent groups, had been using LTTE songs and slogans in their meeting in Kilinochchi and Mullaithivu Districts, just to exploit the feelings of the LTTE sympathisers among Tamils in those areas.

China Merchant pays second tranche of US$97.3mn in H?tota Port investment
	
China Merchant Port Holdings (CMPort) today made the payment of US$ 97.365 million to the Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA) as the second tranche of its investment in the Public-Private Partnership (PPP).
Sri Lanka formally handed over commercial activities of the Hambantota Port to the Chinese company in December 2017 and received $292 million out of the $1.12 billion deal, as the first tranche.
With the second payment, China Merchant Port Holdings (CMPort) had paid US$ 389.462 million to date.
The final payment is scheduled to be paid within six months of December 9, 2017, when the agreement was signed.
SLPA Chairman Parakrama Dissanayake said CMPort was one of the most successful global companies in the Ports sector, and their investment in the Port of Hambantota could be described as a credible vote of confidence in its potential as well as in the economy of Sri Lanka.
The two companies established in Hambantota plan to invest an additional US$ 400 million to US$ 600 million on Phase I and II of the Hambantota Port, in 2018-19.

Fake media will learn a lesson on Feb 10: Kiriella
	
Certain media institutes were fabricating fake news and they would learn an unforgettable lesson after the February 10 elections, UNP Parliamentarian Minister Lakshman Kiriella said at a UNP meeting in Gurudeniya
?The UNP cannot be defeated by false propaganda and our victory of the election will prove it,? he said.
?President Donald Trump could win the election despite false propaganda campaign carried out by 99 percent of American media. But Donald Trump explained to people about the false propaganda carried by the media using the term Fake News and he also won the presidential election,? Kiriella said.
Minister Kiriella said if the media went beyond their limit of freedom they would learn a good lesson on February 10.
?The UNP will win all the local government institutes in the hill country and it was UNP voters in this area who mostly contributed for the victory of the President and the UNP victory at the last general elections.
?Even in 2005 when Mahinda Rajapaksa won most electorates in other parts of the country he could not win Kandy. This left Kandy being ignored by the last Government. The expressway allocated for Kandy was shifted to the Southern province,? he said.
?Local government institutes capable of developing the area should be elected. This good governance government will continue definitely till 2015,? he said.
Many UNP candidates were also present. (J.A. L. Jayasinghe)

Hathurusingha did right thing by choosing Sri Lanka: Streak
	
Zimbabwe cricket team coach Heath Streak, who shared the Bangladesh dressing room with Chandika Hathurusingha when the Sri Lankan was the head coach of the BCB, thinks Hathurusingha did the right thing by choosing to coach his country.
Streak was appointed by the BCB in May, 2014, around a month after Hathurusingha joined as the Tigers? coach. In May, 2016, Streak decided not to continue as the Bangladesh pace bowling coach right before his contract with the BCB was set to expire.
Hathurusingha?s decision to resign from the Bangladesh job broke out following a disastrous tour of South Africa where the Tigers lost all seven matches across the three formats. Last December, Hathurusingha got appointed as the coach of the Sri Lanka side.
The two former colleagues, Streak and Hathurusingha, are currently touring Bangladesh for the tri-nation ODI series, scheduled to start Monday.
I wasn?t here but obviously, at the end of the day, Chandika is a Sri Lankan. The opportunity to coach your own country is always a big thing. I am sure if it was a Bangladeshi coach in another country and he was offered the opportunity to coach his country he?d have done it,? said Streak during Zimbabwe?s arrival press conference at Mirpur Sher-e-Bangla National Cricket Stadium in Dhaka Saturday.
?Most people would find it hard to turn down the opportunity. I think Hathurusingha did a really good job for Bangladesh; people mustn?t forget the successes they have had under him. Whilst he did sign a three-year contract, I think it is also difficult when you don?t (have your family close). He lives in Australia and his family is there. Coaching is difficult when you are away from your family for extended periods of time. Country is always a prestigious thing to coach; everyone aspires to coach their own country,? Streak explained.
Hathurusingha is touring Bangladesh for the first time since his resignation. The tri-series will be followed by two Test matches and as many T20Is between the Tigers and the Lankans.(Dhaka Tribune)

Parliament fracas: PM to seek disciplinary action
	
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe would seek disciplinary action against UNP MPs who behaved unruly in Parliament last week, State Minister of Defence Ruwan Wijewardene said over the weekend.
Responding to a question made by a journalist at a function held in Gampaha on Saturday (13), the State Minister said the issue was not scripted by the involved parties as speculated by some.
He said the incident occurred when UNP MPs came to the front to protect the Prime Minister, when Opposition members attempted to obstruct the PM?s statement.
He said the incident was not a good example to the country and that the MPs were not elected to Parliament to fight but to find solutions to people?s problems. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)
