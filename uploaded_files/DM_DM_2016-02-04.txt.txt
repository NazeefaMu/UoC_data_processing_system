Black flag campaign in Vavuniya
	
A group of Tamils in Vavuniya held a black flag campaign this morning saying the Tamils in the Northern Province were unable to celebrate the 68th Independence Day in freedom.
The protest was launched by the Collective of the Families of Disappeared Persons and the citizens committee in the Vavuniya district.
Even though the war has come to an end, many Tamils are detained as political prisoners. The Government is still not able to provide any information about the people who disappeared during the war and resettlement in the north has not been completed. In such a situation, Tamils in the North are not in a position to celebrate Independence Day in freedom, the protestors claimed. (Romesh Madushanka)

Passenger missing after mysterious mid-air explosion
	
A passenger on the flight forced to land at Somalia's Mogadishu airport after a large hole appeared in the fuselage has been confirmed missing by the airline.
Daallo Airlines had previously said that all the passengers had been accounted for.
It is thought that the man fell out of the hole, which appeared shortly after take-off from Mogadishu on Tuesday.
There have been fears that the damage to the flight was caused by a bomb.
But the exact cause is still not clear and Somalia is currently investigating what led the hole to appear on the Djibouti-bound Airbus 321.
Daallo Airlines head Mohamed Ibrahim Yasin Olad told the BBC Somali service that he hoped the investigation would be over soon so that his flights could resume but with tighter security at Mogadishu's airport.
He said that he has given the details to security officials investigating the incident.
Mohamed Hassan, a police officer in Balad, an agricultural town 30km (18 miles) north of Mogadishu, said residents had found the body of a man who might have fallen from the plane.
Security officials say two passengers were also hurt in the incident.
Serbian captain Vlatko Vodopivec said he and others were told the explosion was caused by a bomb, though civil aviation authority officials said they had found no evidence so far of a criminal act.
"It was my first bomb; I hope it will be the last,'' Mr Vodopivec said. He said the blast happened when the plane was at around 11,000ft (3,350m).
"It would have been much worse if we were higher," he added.
Daallo Airlines flies regularly from its base in Dubai to Somalia and Djibouti.
Somalia is battling militant Islamist group al-Shabab that has been carrying out deadly attacks in its quest to establish an Islamic state. (BBC)

## Title: President should be questioned, if outsiders appointed

President should be questioned, if outsiders appointed
	
The legal expert and respected civil servant Prof. Nihal Jayawickrama said yesterday that according to the 19th Amendment to the Constitution, the Constitutional Council should question the President if outsiders are appointed bypassing the most senior officers to top posts.
The internationally renowned independent legal consultant said a complicated situation had arisen as procedures had not been formulated with regard to the appointments and recommendations made by the newly appointed Constitutional Council.
Dr. Jayawickreme asked whether, if the President appointed some outsider or a junior officer (instead of the officer who is next in line) to the vacant post, the Constitutional Council should not ask why the President overlooked the person who was next in line. However Dr. Jayawickreme pointed out there is serious question if an outsider or a junior officer is appointed as the Attorney General disregarding the present Solicitor General, as the latter had was twice been appointed by the same Council as the acting AG.
If he is not suitable why he was appointed as acting AG he asked.
When asked about a situation where the most senior person in a department (such as the Attorney Generals Department or the Auditor Generals Department) was overlooked, Dr. Jayawickrama said Without laid down procedures how do they know suitability of a person for a given position.
At present there is question with regard to the non-appointment of the most senior officer of the Department as the Attorney General, Daily Mirror learns. It is rumoured that attempts are being made to appoint an outsider or junior officer, bypassing the most senior officer -- the Solicitor General -- who is next in line. 
If the most senior officer is ignored and an outsider or a junior officer from the same department is appointed, the Constitutional Council should explain why the senior officer was overlooked.
However, if an outsider or junior officer is to be appointed as the Attorney General, there should be a proper procedure: those eligible should be interviewed and a fair hearing should be given to all of them, said Dr. Jayawickrema, a former Permanent Secretary to the Justice Ministry and former Professor of Law at the University of Hong Kong.
The Constitutional Council must justify its ruling that the most senior officer is unsuitable for the post. There should be a proper procedure, he said.
Otherwise the CC would appear to be simply rubberstamping the decisions of the President, he said.
Meanwhile, another constitutional expert who did not want to be named said: With the 19th Amendment coming into force, the prerogative powers hitherto exercised by the Executive President are now subject to judicial review under the article 126 of the Constitution, namely, fundamental rights.
Now the crucial question that comes up for discussion is whether, in exercising its powers, the Constitutional Council could act in an arbitrary manner, violating the principles of natural justice, he said.
For example, once the Executive President makes a recommendation to the Constititional Council to fill the vacancy of a scheduled officer such as the Auditor General or the Attorney General, and if that person is not acceptable to a majority of the members (or to one or two members) of the council, could that recommendation be rejected without a proper inquiry and without affording an opportunity to the person concerned to meet any allegations made against him in an arbitrary manner he asked
He further said that, if they could thus resort to such action, it was inevitable that such action would lead to disarray, stultifying the idea of introducing the 19th Amendment.
In the meantime, the Legal Association of the Attorney Generals Department has unanimously decided that they should be given an opportunity to meet President Maithripala Sirisena to discuss the issues relating to the filling of the vacancy in the Attorney Generals Department. At the same time they intend to raise the issue, with both the President and the Prime Minister, of the unfair criticism of the Department (and attacks on the departments integrity) by certain politicians.

Where is genuine freedom FSP
	
The Frontline Socialist Party (FSP) today questioned whether there was genuine freedom in the country as pledged by the Good Governance and said the freedom had become a privilege limited to the accomplices of the Government.
Staging a protest in Pettah (Colombo), the FSP said the government came into power promising to take action on the incidents such as the disappearance of journalist Prageeth Eknaligoda, political activists Lalith and Kugan and the murder of newspaper editor Lasantha Wickrematunge but it had not delivered justice to any of these incidents so far.
FSP Central Committee Member Duminda Nagamuwa said both the President and the Prime Minster had previously promised to release political prisoners but they had failed to do so after coming to power.
Now the government says that there are no political prisoners and they have been arrested on charges of terrorism. Yahapalanaya assured that there will be no political victimization but today they have arrested our member, Kumar Gunaratnum, only because he voiced against the governments opinion. He is a political prisoner today, Mr. Nagamuwa told Daily Mirror. (Lahiru Pothmulla)
