Al Haj Deshabandu Sir Abdul W.M. Ameer A striking and unassuming personality
	
Sir A.W.M Ameer, a businessman by profession, a diplomat as a Consul General and an invisible politician  specially one who backed up others in order to safeguard the interests of Muslim community- is fondly remembered by many although he left us 17 years ago. He passed away on October 25, 2001. 
Late Sir Ameer was engaged in the field of Hospitality Management and was the Chairman of Hotel Ranmuthu, a star-classed hotel in the 70s and early 80s during which tourism industry in Sri Lanka was just emerging. Thus he was one of the pioneers who contributed to the countrys tourism and Hospitality industry. 
Sir Ameer represented The Dominican Republic as the Honorary Consul General of Sri Lanka. Every year in October, Sir Ameer organized the Columbus Day in order to mark the discovery under the aegis of the Sri Lanka-Latin America-Caribbean Friendship Society (SLLACFS) for which he was the founder president and was the dean of the Honorary Consular Corp. He strove to promote understanding and friendship between Sri Lanka and The Dominican Republic. 
His exceptional forty years of continuous being as the Consul General was very significant in the whole world diplomatic services. It was in recognition of his great, longest and enthusiastic services to Dominican Republic and to human kinds in general, that he was knighted with the title Sir by the State of the country. 
He was a member as well as the president of the Colombo Central Rotary Club.
Sir Ameer was a vice president of the English Speaking Union of Sri Lanka.
He was a senior member of the all Ceylon Moors Association. He served as a vice president of the Moor Islamic Cultural Home until the time of his demise. 
He was an invisible politician. That is to say, he backed up many Muslim politicians to be the voice for this minority community.
Sir Ameer was the Chief founder of the Refugees Relief Organization (RRO). He personally visited all the refugee camps in many parts
of the Island.
Sir Ameer was amiable, striking and unassuming personality, who always dedicated to his area of work. May Allah, the almighty grant him Jannathul Firthous.

Could there be an alternative  US foreign policy
	

At last a book that attacks the Blob and holes it below the water line. Whether it can sink it is another matter. Im talking about a book published last week by the Harvard professor of international affairs, Stephen Walt, The Hell of Good Intentions.
The Blob is a wonderful word conjured up by President Barack Obamas Deputy National Security Advisor, Ben Rhodes. It means the group of congressmen, generals, industrialists, academics and journalists who specialize in foreign policy and have an influence promoting what Walt calls Liberal Hegemony.
This, he defines, as the default setting for US foreign policy by the ingrown foreign policy establishment. Open-ended efforts to remake the world in Americas image give them plenty to do, appeals to its members self-regard and maximizes their status and power. Its a full employment policy (by those who were thrown out of work at the end of the Cold War, I should add) for the foreign policy elite and the path of least resistance for groups seeking to convince the US Government to do something far away on behalf of somebody else.

Proponents of Liberal Hegemony dont believe that a liberal order arises spontaneously or sustains itself automatically. For them the goal has to be enforced when necessary

Walt is as severe on his home country as any Harvard professor can be: A few States have caused more harm to others in recent years that the US has, but not very many. And he is just not talking about the regime of President Donald Trump. He goes back through the eras of Barack Obama, George W. Bush, Bill Clinton, George H.W. Bush, Ronald Reagan, Jimmy Carter, Gerald Ford and Richard Nixon.
Proponents of Liberal Hegemony dont believe that a liberal order arises spontaneously or sustains itself automatically. For them the goal has to be enforced when necessary.
The goal Its a liberal order where most States are governed according to liberal principles: democracy, the rule of law, religious and social tolerance and respect for human rights. At the international level it means economic openness, relations between States regulated by law and institutions such as the World Trade Organisation, the Non-Proliferation Treaty and multilateral alliances such as NATO.
But the concept often fails -- as it has in Vietnam, Central America, Iraq, Afghanistan and Yemen. It exaggerates Americas ability to reshape other societies and underestimates the ability of weaker countries and movements to thwart it. Its also, too often, built on deception of the public, and self-deception of the initiators.
Not every high official has been a paid-up member of the Liberal Hegemony group. One dissident is General Colin Powell, a former chief-of-staff of the military, along with his fellow realists such as Brent Scowcroft, National Security Advisor to George H.W. Bush, his Jimmy Carter counterpart, Zbigniew Brzezinski, two former ambassadors to the Soviet Union, George Kennan and Jack Matlock. All of them opposed the expansion of NATO in the way it came about, which, as Kennan put it, was a tragic mistake, the worst since the end of World War II.
The commanding heights of American journalism have a lot to answer for. Theyve made serious errors and then, when their advocacy was proved wrong, not held themselves accountable. Both the New York Times and Washington Post published many false stories about Iraqs alleged possession of weapons of mass destruction. There are no major, well-placed columnists consistently advocating an alternative point of view to Liberal Hegemony.
Trump, during his campaign, appeared to criticise the Liberal Hegemony advocates. But with his inchoate world view, he was unable to overcome their advocacy and has quickly fallen into line.
Hes faced a formidable opposition: the quiet resistance of his own staff and the civil and military services, well-funded conservative think tanks, congress with its links to a powerful business community and a network of conservative non-governmental organisations.
Walt has an alternative, one that appears to resonate with the new millennial generation who perceive less foreign dangers, are less patriotic and are decidedly less supportive of military solutions. One sees this in the ongoing presidential campaign of Senator Bernie Sanders. Walt calls it offshore balancing.
He defines it this way: Instead of trying to remake the world in Americas image, foreign policy should focus on US position in the global balance of power. So it calls for the US to deploy its power abroad only when there are direct threats to US interests. As long as theres no potential threatening hegemon in Europe, the Gulf or Northeast Asia, then theres no need for a military interest. This is how it is at the moment.
If America had done this, Russia would by now be partly integrated into NATO, there would have been no pushing the boundaries of NATO, it would have ended the containment of Iran, and if its military had left Saudi Arabia after the first Gulf war, there might have been no 9/11.

How Sampanthan Made Wigneswaran The TNA Chief Candidate In 2013
	
By
D.B.S. Jeyaraj

Gratitude is a virtue that is greatly valued in Tamil society and culture
Discussions at the TNA office in Bambalapitiya established a clear demarcation of battle lines
Provincial Councils enjoy a certain quantum of devolution

Blow, blow, thou winter wind, Thou art not so unkind, As mans ingratitude - William Shakespeare As You Like It.
Its official now!
Canagasabapathy Visuvalingam Wigneswaran has announced the launch of a new political formation known as the Thamizh Makkal Koottani meaning Tamil Peoples Alliance (TPA). The retired Supreme Court judge who was until a few days ago the Northern Province Chief Minister has split from the Thamizh Thesiya Koottamaippu or the Tamil National Alliance (TNA) and declared his intent to form the TPA which is expected to electorally-target the TNA. Some may even argue that the raison detre for the new TPA is the objective of politically undermining the old TNA.
The Tamil National Alliance is the premier political configuration of Sri Lankan Tamils. The chief constituent of the TNA is the Ilankai Thamil Arasu Katchi (ITAK) referred to in English as the Federal Party (FP). The TNA contests under the House symbol of the ITAK in elections. C.V. Wigneswaran contested the Northern Provincial Council elections in September 2013 as the chief ministerial candidate of the TNA. He contested as the ITAK candidate in the Jaffna District with the backing of other TNA constituents at that time, namely the TELO, PLOTE, TULF and EPRLF.
Current leader of the opposition and veteran Tamil politician Rajavarothayam Sampanthan was the President of ITAK and Parliamentary group leader of the TNA in 2013. It was Sampanthan who was primarily responsible for selecting Wigneswaran as the TNA chief ministerial candidate. This he did against much opposition within party folds. Sampanthan was aided in this exercise by MP M.A. Sumanthiran. Sampanthan was at one point even prepared to quit his position if Wigneswaran were not nominated. The NPC election on September 21, 2013 resulted in a massive victory for the TNA which romped home the winners with 30 of 38 seats. Wigneswaran garnered over 132,000 preference votes. The TNA victory was a joint success of Sampanthan and Wigneswaran. Both were crowned with flowers at victory celebrations.
Much was expected of C.V. Wigneswaran when he was first elected chief minister of the Northern Province. Sadly those hopes turned into dupes very soon. Wigneswaran adopted a confrontational political approach that left much to be desired. Projecting himself as a Tamil hardliner, the ex-chief minister engaged in all types of disruptive politics while the Northern Provincial administration deteriorated. The Northern Provincial Council (NPC) became the worst-run provincial administration in the country.
The provincial councils of Sri Lanka do enjoy a certain quantum of devolution. They may not have maximum devolution but the powers available are adequate to plan and implement a reasonable amount of development projects. The provincial council representing the war-afflicted people of the war-ravaged North had an extra responsibility and duty to harness all available resources for the betterment of the province. But this was not what happened. Instead of passing necessary statutes, the NPC busied itself with passing hundreds of useless, irrelevant resolutions. Finances allocated by the Treasury for development work in the province were under-utilised resulting in the remainder being returned to the Treasury. When major projects with international aid for the benefit of the North were initiated by the government in Colombo, the NPC did not cooperate and instead obstructed them. When concerned Sri Lankan expatriates came up with blueprints to establish employment-oriented, income-generating schemes, they were rebuffed and rejected. The credo adopted by Wigneswaran and his cohorts was Abilaashaigalae Mukkiam, Abhiviruthiyalla (Aspirations are only important not development).

TAMIL PEOPLES COUNCIL
Moreover in a classic exhibition of political backstabbing, C.V. Wigneswaran began working -- covertly and at times overtly -- against the TNA in general and the ITAK in particular. He floated a rival outfit called the Tamil Peoples Council (TPC) in association with a motley group of political elements and said the TPC would not contest elections. Now after the end of his chief minister tenure, Wigneswaran has announced the formation of the TPA to contest elections. It has now become blatantly clear that the arch-disciple of Swami Premananda has kicked away the TNA ladder on which he climbed to reach the top.
Wigneswaran delivered a lengthy address in Nallur the erstwhile capital of the Jaffna Kingdom ruled by the Arya Chakkaravarthy dynasty many centuries ago. The ex-chief minister read out the speech drafted by him personally. The political significance of the speech was not in what was said but in what was left unsaid. One would have expected a retired Supreme Court judge to have the elementary courtesy of acknowledging the TNA/ITAK which elevated him to great heights in politics. One would have expected the former chief minister to have the basic grace of at least thanking Sampanthan for having selected and nominated him as the TNA chief ministerial candidate. Nothing at all was mentioned. It was as if Canagasabapathy Visuvalingam Wigneswaran had entered politics and become chief minister without any aid or assistance of Rajavarothayam Sampanthan .
It is against this backdrop therefore that this column will focus on how and why C.V. Wigneswaran was picked and backed by R. Sampanthan to be the TNA chief ministerial candidate in 2013. When it became known that elections to the Northern Provincial Council would be held in 2013, it became clear that the Tamil National Alliance would fare best at the polls. The immediate questions were how many seats would the TNA win and who would be the first Northern chief minister. Initially the latter question had many contenders vying to be the answer.
Among the names being bandied or talked about as potential chief ministerial candidates were retired Jaffna University ProfessorS.K. Sittambalam, ex-Jaffna Municipal Commissioner C.V.K. Sivagnanam, Colombo University Law Professor V.T. Thamilmaran, retired Jaffna High Court Judge E.T. Vicknarajah and newspaper Editor N. Vithiyatharan. If these were spoken of as contenders outside active politics, there were aspirants from within political parties too. Somasuntharam Senathirajah alias Maavai of ITAK, Kandiah Premachandran alias Suresh of EPRLF, MK Sivajilingam of TELO also evinced interest in the chief ministerial stakes at one point of time. Other possibilities for the chief ministerial post were veteran politician Veerasingham Aanandasangaree of the TULF and Dharmalingam Siddharthan of the PLOTE. Two other names spoken about were former Mannar MP Philip Soosaithasan (who has since passed away) and S.C. Chandrahasan, the son of respected Tamil leader S.J.V. Chelvanayagam or Thanthai Selva.

CHIEF MINISTERIAL CANDIDATE
It appeared that the prevalent fragile unity of the TNA might shatter over the huge competition to be chief minister. It was in this situation that TNA leader Rajavarothayam Sampanthan thought of bringing in a complete outsider with exemplary qualifications and unimpeachable credentials as chief ministerial candidate. His choice was retired Supreme Court Judge C.V. Wigneswaran whose name had been proposed to the TNA leadership by members of the Tamil elite in Sri Lanka and abroad.
Justice Wigneswaran though of Jaffna origin had grown up in Colombo studying at Royal College. He had a distinguished record at the bar before mounting the bench. Essentially a cosmopolitan, Wigneswaran also retained strong Hindu links.
Sampanthan felt that Wigneswaran was the ideal choice for a number of reasons. Given his qualifications and experience and his track record while on the bench and afterwards, Wigneswaran was sure to attract votes immensely in the North.
It was also felt it was necessary to have a man of eminence like Wigneswaran as Northern chief minister at that historic juncture. The new chief minister would have to meet with the Colombo Government on a number of matters. He needed to negotiate with the government for more powers, resources and functions for the council. He should have the ability to interact on equal terms with the governor and military hierarchy in the North. He must also be able to deal with international leaders, diplomats and media personnel. These required extraordinary attributes and ideally, Wigneswaran seemed to fit the bill. Besides, Wigneswaran possessed legal acumen and expertise that could be of crucial importance.
More importantly, Sampanthan also felt that the quibbling over chief ministerial stakes in the TNA would end once Wigneswaran was picked. He expected the other contenders to bow out gracefully when a man of Wigneswarans mercurial stature became available. Thus, internal dissension on this account could be avoided.
When approached Wigneswaran himself was reluctant to get into active politics. He preferred to be in the background and be an adviser rather than face hustings. Also he was fully aware of the internal differences in the TNA and did not want to get enmeshed in a political web. He wanted a united invitation from all five TNA constituents. Wigneswaran also entertained the notion that he could lead an independent united list of Tamils rather than that of a political party. With such options being ruled out, Wigneswaran respectfully declined the offer.

AN UNCONTROLLABLE PERSONALITY
Other currents too were flowing across the Elephant Pass isthmus even as Sampanthan was wooing Wigneswaran. While the Jaffna elite was delighted with the choice of Wigneswaran, other political elements in the ITAK were not greatly enamoured of the ex-Supreme Court judge. The party machinery was doubtful whether the independent Wigneswaran would fit into the Jaffna political scene and abide by the decisions of the TNA. He was seen as an uncontrollable personality (ultimately these fears were proved true).
Sampanthan however did not give up on Wigneswaran. Sampanthan apparently believed in not taking no for an answer. The octogenarian Tamil leader aided by TNA National List MP M.A. Sumanthiran persistently wooed C.V. Wigneswaran and finally the Hulftsdorp born Wigneswaran whose parents hail from Maanipaai in Jaffna said Om (yes).
The interlude between Wigneswarans refusal and acceptance had been utilised to mount a campaign promoting the then ITAK General-Secretary and senior Jaffna District MP Somasundaram Senathirajah known as Maavai Senathirajah as chief ministerial candidate. He is now the ITAK President. Senathirajah who maintained silence as the campaign gathered momentum announced after a while that he was prepared to contest to serve the people if the people wanted it. However, he qualified his willingness by saying it depended on approval from the party. After Wigneswaran consented to contest, Sampanthan expected Senathirajah to bow out from the race gracefully and wind up his candidacy campaign. Senathirajah kept a discreet silence on this without committing himself either way. While not asserting his claim to Sampanthan, Maavai also did not announce a withdrawal.

Sampanthan felt Wigneswaran was the ideal choice for a number of reasons
TNA victory a joint success of Sampanthan and Wigneswaran
The major difference of opinion that emerged between Sampanthan and Senathirajah over the Northern chief ministerial post was one that could have been averted. Had both leaders met in private beforehand and engaged in an honest discussion the potential crisis may have been resolved through a mutually acceptable compromise. This did not happen. So here was Sampanthan expecting Senathirajah to bow out from a race that had not begun and also convince his backers to back out and there was Senathirajah determined to stake what he regarded as his rightful claim to be the first chief minister of the Northern Provincial Council. However, the differences between Sampanthan and Senathirajah were not serious enough to be described as a rift.
It was against this backdrop that the TNA Coordinating Committee first met on July 11, 2013 at the ITAK office in Bambalapitiya to select the chief ministerial candidate. Representatives of the five parties in TNA began discussing. Sampanthan chairing the meeting let others talk first. In a complicated reversal of roles the non -- ITAK parties, namely the EPRLF, TELO, PLOTE and TULF -- proposed the name of the ITAKs Mavai Senathirajah and spoke in support of his candidacy.

SOMASUNTHARAM MAAVAI SENATHIRAJAH
In a further twist, the ITAK to which Senathirajah belonged proposed Wigneswarans name instead of their Secretary-General. While MP Shritharan was in Canada, the others, Selvarajah (ex-Batticaloa MP) and Sumanthiran spoke in favour of Wigneswaran. Somasuntharam Maavai Senathirajah adopted a conspicuous silence letting his nonITAK colleagues of the TNA do all the talking in his favour. Sampanthan as chair remained silent throughout the proceedings until his turn came at the last. Thereafter, Sampanthan waxed eloquent in support of Wigneswaran. Instead of being critical of Senathirajah explicitly, Sampanthan chose to espouse the merits of Wigneswaran and how the ex-judge would prove ideal to meet the challenge of being chief minister of the North at this critical juncture (how wrong Sampanthan was). Sampanthan also stated unambiguously that Wigneswaran himself had not wanted to be Northern chief minister and that it was he (Sampanthan) who wanted Wigneswaran to be chief minister.
The meeting ended inconclusively as Sampanthan wound up his address. Thereafter, it was arranged to reconvene the following day and finalise the issue. Heated discussions continued on the second day too without any visible shift in previous positions. At one point of time, the ITAKs Sumanthiran appealed to Senathirajah directly and appraised the senior MP of the problems likely to be faced by the new chief minister. Sumanthiran explained in detail as to why Wigneswaran was better equipped than Senathirajah to face such challenges in the present context (again how wrong Sumanthiran was).
The discussions at the TNA office in Bambalapitiya established a clear demarcation of battle lines. The EPRLF, TELO, TULF and PLOTE were on one side espousing the name of Senathirajah. While Senathirajah remained silent, his colleagues from ITAK were supportive of Justice Wigneswaran. Despite Sampanthan and Sumanthiran making powerful, intellectually convincing arguments in favour of Wigneswaran, the supporters of Senathirajah would not budge. They were adamant that Senathirajah should be the choice regardless of merit.
The essence of their argument however was that Wigneswaran though of Jaffna origin was now a Tamil resident in Colombo who was born and bred there. Senathirajah on the other hand was a son of the Jaffna soil. Furthermore, Wigneswaran was not a member of the ITAK and had no political experience. Senathirajah however was involved from his youthful days in the Tamil political struggle. He was also a founding member of the TNA. In a nutshell the argument was that the insider Senathirajah should be preferred over the outsider Wigneswaran regardless of the individual merits of both. Parachutists from outside were to be debarred.
These points were well articulated by former TELO Parliamentarian N. Srikantha who is also a lawyer. While arguing that the Northern chief minister should be a member of the TNA and not an outsider, Srikantha deftly promoted himself also as a potential contender. Srikantha said if Senathirajah was deemed inappropriate because he was not a lawyer then the TNA should turn to those in the alliance before resorting to outside nominations.


EVOKED A STRONG RESPONSE
Srikantha evoked a strong response from Sampanthan who posed the question whether the TNA was to remain stagnant without any infusion of fresh new talent for ever and ever if the policy was to be no outsiders This meant that the party could not even register any ordinary new members. Sampanthan also pointed out that Srikantha and Senathirajah from Jaffna had at one time parachuted into Trincomalee and Ampara Districts as candidates. Sampanthan made it crystal clear that his choice was Wigneswaran only. Although he did not express it openly, it appeared that the veteran politician was even ready to quit the TNA leadership if his choice was rebuffed.
It was then that Senathirajah broke his silence and spoke out aloud. In a bid to show that he was not a seeker of office for the sake of power the man from Maaviddapuram reiterated that he was seeking nomination only because many people within and outside Sri Lanka were pressing him to contest. Not even one person who spoke to me said I should not contest, said Senathirajah. He then said that he valued Wigneswaran very highly and suggested that it was possible for both of them to work together in the future. The second day meeting ended on this positive note by Senathirajah. It was decided that the discussions should continue in the afternoon of Saturday, July 13, 2013.
The concluding remarks of Senathirajah gave room for optimism that a satisfactory compromise could be worked out. Quiet unofficial discussions among individuals and groups within the alliance began at different levels. TNA national list MP Sumanthiran began working out a scheme where Wigneswaran could be chief minister for the first half of the term and Senathirajah for the second. Sampanthan however was not in favour of such an adjustment saying it would convey contrary impressions to the voter and could be counterproductive. Senathirajah too was not very receptive to the idea saying it would be practically difficult to implement such an arrangement. Senathirajah being a Parliamentarian was not comfortable with the idea of going into the Provincial Council and waiting patiently till Wigneswarans tenure was over. Unofficial discussions continued.
Sampanthan and Sumanthiran continued with their efforts in promoting the candidature of Wigneswaran. Sampanthan spoke to Suresh Premachandran of EPRLF and Adaikalanathan of TELO. Both agreed in principle to Wigneswaran being the chief ministerial candidate but wanted Senathirajahs concurrence. Sumanthiran began engaging Senathirajah in talks over the subject. As a result of these unpublicised discussions a new move was initiated.
A meeting was arranged where Sampanthan, Senathirajah, Sumanthiran, Suresh Premachandran and Selvam Adaikalanathan were to visit Justice Wigneswaran at his residence and discuss pertinent issues concerning the nomination. It is noteworthy that the former Supreme Court judge had not in anyway participated in the TNA discussions tasked with selecting a chief ministerial candidate. Although he had agreed to be the candidate if the TNA chose him, Wigneswaran had not tried in any way to press his claim. When people spoke to him about the protracted discussions within the TNA the ex-judge had simply laughed it off saying let them give it to anybody.

TNA CANDIDATE UNDER ITAK SYMBOL
Selvam Adaikalanathan was not able to attend the meeting on Saturday morning with Wigneswaran but the other four did so as planned. The meeting with Wigneswaran went off very well with some doubts being cleared. Wigneswaran stated clearly that he was prepared to contest as the TNA candidate under the ITAK symbol and not as head of an independent list of candidates. He also said that his only request was for all TNA constituent parties to agree to his candidacy.
The third round of talks scheduled for July 13 evening was put off for the morning of Monday, July 15. When the meeting began the representatives from the EPRLF, TELO, TULF and PLOTE spoke in favour of Wigneswaran as being the most suitable candidate at this juncture. Yet they did not ask Senathirajah to withdraw from the contest. Each one who spoke added a rider after praising Wigneswaran as the more suitable choice. The rider was that Wigneswaran could be the choice provided Senathirajah was amenable. Senathirajah himself resolved the dilemma by speaking out formally.
Explaining the reasons behind his intent to contest, Senathirajah emphasised that he had done so only because of requests by the people. He then thanked his TNA colleagues for their support and announced that he was standing down in favour of Wigneswaran because he did not want to disrupt the unity and strength of the party. Senathirajah also praised Wigneswaran and said he was endorsing the ex-judges candidature. With Senathirajahs magnanimous withdrawal the problem ended. Wigneswaran became the unanimous choice.
Thereafter representatives from all five parties of the TNA led by Senathirajah went to Wigneswarans residence and conveyed the glad tidings of great joy to him. Wigneswaran was happy that the choice had been approved by all five parties who had come together to formally inform him of it. He was particularly thankful to Senathirajah for his magnanimous conduct and stated that he was expecting his cooperation and support in the future. And then they all smilingly posed for the camera!
Canagasabapathy Visuvalingam Wigneswaran was named by the Tamil National Alliance (TNA) on the ides of July as its chief ministerial candidate for the forthcoming Northern Provincial Council election. The TNA issued a terse press release announcing the selection of Wigneswaran. It was unanimously resolved that the candidate for the post of chief minister at the forthcoming Provincial Council elections for the Northern Province would be C.V. Wigneswaran, a retired judge of the Supreme Court of Sri Lanka. Other nominations will be finalised in due course by the TNA, the communiqu stated. It further said C. V. Wigneswaran is a much respected public personality and we appeal to the voters in the Northern Province to wholeheartedly support C. V. Wigneswaran, the chief ministerial candidate of the TNA and all other candidates who will be nominated for election.

ILANKAI THAMIL ARASU KATCHI
However there was another minor theatre of conflict within Ilankai Thamil Arasu Katchi(ITAK) ranks over Wigneswaran being selected as chief ministerial candidate. The selection of Wigneswaran was done by the coordinating committee of the TNA where all four non-ITAK constituents had been in favour of Senathirajah. But parliamentarians from the ITAK - Sampanthan, Sumanthiran and Selvarajah had been supportive of Wigneswaran. This was rather ironic with Senathirajah being supported by other parties but not his own the ITAK. Thus the stage seemed to be set for an internal clash within the ITAK over the chief ministerial selection issue. It appeared that a showdown was on the cards when the working committee of the ITAK met in Vavuniya. So it was expected that the sparks would fly in Vavuniya. Some felt that the chief ministerial candidacy issue would be reopened and that the ITAK would demand that Wigneswaran be jettisoned and Senathirajah crowned.
This however did not happen but the sparks did fly! While Senathirajah maintained poignant silence the big gun that boomed against Sampanthan was Emeritus Professor S.K. Sittampalam. Sittampalam harshly disapproved of the decision to designate Wigneswaran as chief candidate. He was followed on the same lines but with more restraint by C.V.K. Sivagnanam. Others too followed suit but were not too critical of Sampanthan. Some tried to balance their views and a few spoke in support of Sampanthan. It was however apparent that the party disapproved of the TNAs unanimous choice (how right the ITAK was). The essence of the anti-Sampanthan viewpoint was that party loyalists were being ignored or overlooked and that outsiders and other party members were being given prominence at the expense of ITAK. If this trend continued the ITAK would cease to exist was the widespread lament.
Sampanthan listened to all these views and then responded. It was a masterly exhibition of powerful oratory by the legal eagle turned politico. Sampanthan demolished the arguments outlined against him. He explained very clearly the reasons for Wigneswaran being chosen. He also pointed out that Senathirajah had stood down in favour of Wigneswaran thus compelling Senathirajah to openly acknowledge the fact that Wigneswaran was the better candidate in the current context.
Finally Sampanthan quelled critical opinion by a meaningful statement. He said in Tamil that the Tamil people in Sri Lanka were in dire straits facing extinction but the gathering here was not talking of that. I did not hear even one person talking of the Tamil people. All I heard was talk about party, party and nothing else, Sampanthan said. Speaking further, he pointed out that the party was for the people and that the future of the people mattered more than the party. If the people diminish can the party flourish, he queried rhetorically.

TWO RESOLUTIONS PASSED
Having transformed the mood in his favour, Sampanthan went on to suggest that two resolutions be passed. The first was to approve the selection of C.V. Wigneswaran as the chief ministerial candidate for the Northern Provincial Council and extend full support. The second was to commend the magnanimity of Senathirajah in withdrawing from contesting for the chief ministerial candidacy. Both resolutions were passed unanimously. Sampanthan had not only weathered another inner-party crisis but also enlisted unanimous party support for Wigneswaran his choice and confined Senathirajah firmly to non-contestant status.
This then is the tale of how C.V. Wigneswaran got nomination as the chief ministerial candidate of the TNA. Contesting under the ITAK house symbol, the ex-judge won handsomely and became chief minister. After enjoying the perks and privileges of the powerful chief minister post for five years, Wigneswaran has now ditched the TNA and opted to launch the TPA. In the unkindest cut of all, he has let down his one time political benefactor Sampanthan badly.
Gratitude is a virtue that is greatly valued in Tamil society and culture. The Thirukkural written by Thiruvalluvar is regarded as a great Tamil literary work on ethics and morality. The Thirukkural emphasizes the importance of gratitude and warns in a couplet that there is no redemption for those who display ingratitude. The political fate of Wigneswaran and the TPA remains to be seen.

## Title: Mental ill-health the latest NCD

Mental ill-health the latest NCD
	
The World Health Organisation (WHO) marked the World Mental Health Day this month with the theme being young people and mental health in a changing world. The aim is to raise global awareness of mental health issues and to stimulate advocacy. 
According to the WHO, this theme is of vital concern because about 1 in 5 adolescents experience mental and behavioural problems in any given year. Moreover, half of all mental health problems in adulthood have their onset during or before adolescence.
Dr. Bente Mikkelsen, WHOs/Europe Director of the Division of Noncommunicable Diseases and Promoting Health through the Life-course states, It is important to protect the younger generations as they are the future leaders. We need youth at every table. We need their voices to shape their future in the right way, using their creativity and energy to make change.
With the recent release of 2 WHO/Europe reports, Situation of child and adolescent health in Europe and Adolescent alcohol-related behaviours: trends and inequalities in the WHO European Region, 20022014, the health and well-being of young people is high on the regional agenda.
Dr Mikkelsen notes that the area of mental health is still misunderstood, but now there is momentum and the highest possible recognition of mental health.
At the third United Nations General Assembly high-level meeting on noncommunicable diseases (NCDs), held last month in New York, mental ill-health was endorsed as the fifth NCD alongside cardiovascular diseases, cancer, diabetes and respiratory diseases.
According to the WHO, half of all mental illnesses begin by the age of 14, but most cases go undetected and untreated. In terms of the burden of the disease among adolescents, depression is the third leading cause. Suicide is the second leading cause of death among 15-29 year-olds.
Harmful use of alcohol and illicit drugs among adolescents is a major issue in many countries and can lead to risky behaviours such as unsafe sex or dangerous driving. Eating disorders are also of concern.
In Sri Lanka, till recently, there was an imbalance in our thinking with those with known mental disorders being marginalised or even condemned as Mulleriyawa cases. In a derogatory manner, many also would often say someone should be sent to Angoda referring to the area where the public mental hospital is situated. But thinking patterns now are generally more enlightened because most of us are aware that almost all people have some form of mental disorder. This is natural because we suffer far more mental injuries than physical injuries. Each time we are hurt, sidelined or otherwise ill-treated, we suffer mental injuries. 
On Tuesday, the government took an important step to curb the possibility of mental problems among children by making non-compulsory the highly competitive Grade 5 Scholarship examination. During the past few decades especially with subtle forms of selfishness and self-centredness growing in a competitive globalised capitalist market economic system -- many parents perhaps unknowingly pushed their children too much to get high marks in the Grade five scholarship exams. In Grades four and five, tens of thousands of children are known to have been forced to study till late and go for tuition class after class with little or no time for play or recreation. As a result many children are known to have suffered mental health problems which later manifested in more deadly forms like heroin addiction or suicidal tendencies. 
According to research done by social science lecturers M.A.S. Irfana and K. Kanesarajah, physical, mental, social and spiritual related problems have been identified among the students sitting the grade five scholarship exam. The researchers say though more students suffer from phobias like anxiety, grief, tension, stress and personality disorders, they are still forced to sit for this exam. Although they have been some positives such as outstation students getting higher marks than those in prestigious Colombo schools, the negatives are many and it would be a plus point for the society if the government totally scrap the Grade 5 Scholarship competition.

Miss Charlotte Wanigasekera She was known for her hospitality
	
Miss Charlotte Wanigasekera came from a Baptist family from Mugunuwatawana, a small village of Madampe in North Western Province. 
She had two sisters and four brothers. When I met her in 1971 she was the principal of a school in Nawalapitiya. 
She saw to it that the brothers got their education. She encouraged them to get on with their jobs and do well in life. 
She was a selfless lady and opted to remain a spinster. She did a lot for the family. 
I met her, because one of her brothers was married to my husbands sister. She had encouraged this brother to join the education service after his secondary education at Carey College, Colombo. After his training he ended up as an Asst. Zonal Director of Education. 
She loved the Lord and wanted to serve him. She was a of member of the YWCA and I remember the members of the National YWCA telling me, that they loved the trips to Madampe, where meetings were held. 
Miss Charlotte was an affectionate woman and loved to be hospitable. If we visited her she would never send us off without giving us a meal. We remember her sumptuous meals, not forgetting a super duper cashew curry, prepared by Miss Charlotte and her team. 
It was a real shock when we got the news of her demise just three months ago. Two days before she passed away she spoke to me on the phone to inquire about my husband who was in hospital. She told me do not worry. 
She had many nieces and nephews and she was Mamma to them and sister to us.
She was a disciplined lady and this is what she imparted to the next generation. She was much loved and respected by not only by the family, but by all who knew her. 
She was an active member of the Baptist womens League and nurtured a young group of women.
Her dream was to have a little Baptist Church in her Village, Mugunuwatawana. 
God permitted it to lake place before she was called to a better home. There is a small Baptist church at Mugunuwatawana, looked after by a very active young worker. To God be the glory for the great things He has done. 
She was 96 years of age when she left us. May her soul rest in peace.

English and Tamil translations of the report submitted by the Presidential Commission of Inquiry to Investigate and Inquire into Serious Acts of Fraud, Corruption and Abuse of Power, State Resources and Privileges (PRECIFAC) was tabled in parliament yesterday.
Both government and opposition members have asked in parliament why the debate on the PCoI and PRECIFAC reports were being delayed.
The debates on these reports were to be taken up in Parliament on February 20 but postponed indefinitely because of the non-availability of the English and Tamil translations of the PRECIFAC report.
The reports were tabled in Parliament on January 23.
PCoI report was tabled in English while the PRECIFAC report was tabled in Sinhala. However, according to Standing Orders, the reports must be in all three languages if they are to be taken up for debate.
Party leaders had agreed to hold the debate if they were available in English as well but the PRECIFAC report was not available in English and this resulted in the postponement. (Ajith Siriwardana)

Teaching profession  needs new thinking
	

It is interesting to note that the Minister of Education has decided to reduce the number of subjects for G.C.E (Ordinary Level) students.

The philosophy behind this decision has been aimed at reducing the stress levels of the students. 
In my humble opinion this is only seeing the tip of the iceberg. 

Teachers should highlight the importance of investing on time wisely. Students must be taught how to use of time efficiently and avoid time wasting. This will make the students find time to engage in studies

We need to dwell upon finding solutions to the other hidden key factors as well, which would provide a comprehensive solution to reduce stress besides aiding the progress of the students, so that they can reach higher echelons. 
Everything is in the hands of the teachers. Hence, the Ministry of Education should also provide relief to teachers in order to reduce their stress levels. 
The teachers salaries need to be revised, as they struggle to survive at present with the mediocre remuneration they receive. 
Due to this they are depressed. How can we expect them to function normally and provide a better service. Hence, this problem has to be ironed out immediately. 
If these changes are done teachers will fully focus on their duties and produce valuable students to this nation. 
Unfortunately, at present, in most cases, the role of a teacher is limited to inculcating knowledge only. 
They teach keeping with the syllabus and managing the time table and assume that they have done their job. 
They should change with the changing times. 

The teachers are responsible for moulding the characters of their students. They should also inspect the other values mentioned under personal life such as discipline.These are the needs of the hour to turn the people of this country into well-balanced individuals.

Stress
The ultimate objective of the Teaching Profession has to  Produce multi talented students to supersede them. 
Let us now look at the hidden factors which are contributing to the stress in students. 
They are personal Life, work Life. (Studies), family Life, social Life, religious and Spiritual Life. 
Personal life comprises of Personality, Leadership, Attitude, Self-discipline, Behaviour, Punctuality, Regular Attendance, Compassion, Honesty, Hard Work, Self-motivation,Time Management, Communication Skills and Character. 
We hear from those who represent the younger generation that they do not have adequate time to attend to things. 
Teachers should guide them to find time. 
Generally, time is divided into 3 components: Time Investment ( ex: Studying and working productively), Time Spent (ex: Travelling) and Time Wastage (ex: gossiping and idling). 
Teachers should highlight the importance of investing on time wisely. Students must be taught how to use of time efficiently and avoid time wasting. This will make the students find time to engage in studies. 
Imparting knowledge is only a part of the service rendered by teachers.

The other three areas of interests should be developing skills, inculcating values and attitude and making these as habits. 
The teachers are responsible for moulding the characters of their students. 
They should also inspect the other values mentioned under personal life such as discipline. These are the needs of the hour to turn the people of this country into well-balanced individuals. 
The second area under discussion is Work Life. 
i.e : Studies 
Teachers should make the students possess the following values while studying and provide direction. 
Emphasis must be on dedication, determination, discipline and meeting deadlines.
 
They should reiterate the values of hard work and preach to them that there is no substitute for hard work. 
These values if properly inculcated will definitely make the students live a stress-free life at school and at home. 
The third area I would like to emphasise on is Family Life. 
Teachers should teach their students how to be obedient to their parents and elders, how to behave within the family and with their siblings and about the need to uphold family values. 
If they are brought up in this manner it will improve their quality of living besides making this country a better place to live in. 
The fourth area in my focus is Social Life. 
values
The teachers should help find good friends at school. They should also teach the values of true friendship. 
The Teachers should foster Team Work among students. 
They should encourage the students to join in voluntary service associations and clubs, such as Scouting and Literary Associations. 
By learning the values from being in these associations the students will have service oriented minds even when they become adults. 
We need them to serve our motherland in the future. 
The Teachers should teach them how to behave in the neighbourhood and society. 
They should educate their students on the dangers of smoking, alcoholism anddrug addiction, 
So that when they grow up in the society they will have only good habits. 
These lessons are vital as we are witnessing a disgraceful youth society at present. 
The fifth area of my interest is the Religious or Spiritual Life. 
The relationship with our Almighty God through prayers should be taught to students. To do this you need not be the religion teacher. 
The power of prayers should be preached to the students effectively. 
When praying students should not focus on material gain as this is the number one stress builder. 
Rather, they should pray for knowledge, wisdom, peace, harmony and tranquillity. 
Further, the teachers should teach their students that Prayers can move mountains. 
Having read the above contents of my article, I am sure that you would have gathered a fair idea on what needs to be done to reduce stress among students. 
The above suggestions and recommendations will not only lead to a stress-free life, but make us live a whole and prosperous life. 
The need of the hour is a holistic approach to your noble profession. 
By fulfilling the duties outlined in the article, I am confident that you would produce students superseding you. Make them future leaders. 
Hence, I call upon the teachers to play a pivotal role in the lives of our future generations. Their future is in your hands! 
I urge the Ministry of Education to consider the recommendations and create a platform for teachers and also allocate a budget for programmes on the recommendations expressed in the article besides revising their salaries. 
We have been brought up by Teachers of high calibre and we are grateful to our teachers and Alma-Mater for moulding us to reach the current status.

Wickrema de Alwis A gentleman par excellence
	

The curtain came down on the life of Wickrema De Alwis (Wick) on 20th October leaving friends and family to reflect on the qualities of a man that made him not just one of the finest Tea planters the industry had known, but also a true gentleman in every sense of the word. 
My association with Wick as he was fondly known goes back to the mid seventies when as a young Executive at George Steuarts. I was assigned the awesome task of handling the desk of the Companys most prestigious charge viz  The Standard Tea Company, which comprised six remarkable Estates, three in Uda Pussellawa and the balance in Bogawantalawa/Lindula.
Wick was the Superintendent of one of them, viz Kotiyagala Group in Bogawantalawa, a highly profitable property with a popular selling mark which he took great pride in . His leadership was by example, combining the highest level of Integrity with a  No Nonsense  approach to work and ethics that were impossible to surpass and yet worthy to emulate.
Not surprisingly every young planter who served under him went on to reach great heights in their own careers.
Following the nationalisation of Plantations in 1975/76 Wick was appointed to chair a Regional Board by the Government where his expertise and high standards benefited a cluster of estates. 
He became a much sought after Visiting Agent.
His official residences had beautifully manicured lawns surrounded by exotic roses while his impeccably maintained homes were a joy to visit.
In retirement he lived initially in Watapuluwa off Kandy.
He followed our nations cricketwith a passion.
He was blessed in his domestic Saveria , a faithful  Man Friday  of almost forty years whose loyalty and respect for his master remained unwavering throughout that period....a rare occurrence indeed and yet a reflection of a large and caring heart that Wick hid under a strict and exacting exterior.
Sadly the collapse of the Golden Key Finance Company where he had a major part of his life savings, cruelly devastated his life and took inevitable toll of his health. He was compelled to move to a retirement home in Bolgoda where he spent his final years in decline.
Though miles away Wick, you are very much in my thoughts.

May you find  Peaceful Rest  as you deserve. 
S. Skandakumar,
(Sri Lankas High Commissioner in Australia) Canberra
