Anger within JO against 16-member SLFP group is natural - GL
	


The JO consists of several parties. These parties have their distinct identities. They work together under the leadership of former President
They want the government to deliver what it promised
JO will agitate for early parliamentary dissolution
16-member group is not homogeneousat all
The situation in the country is totally chaotic. The government is dysfunctional even at the basic level

Chairman of Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) Prof. G.L. Peiris speaks about the current political situation and what his party plans for the future. The excerpts of the interview: 

QThere are reports about a split in the camp of the Joint Opposition. In certain instances, there are some sort of open confrontations. Why is it
There are no splits in the Joint Opposition (JO). That is a complete misunderstanding. The JO consists of several parties. They are Mahajana Eksath Peramuna (MEP), Vasudeva Nanayakkaras party, Pivithuru Hela Urumaya, the National Freedom Front, Lanka Samasamaja Party, Sri Lanka Mahajana Party etc.
The youngest party is Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) that came into existence a year and a half ago. These parties have their distinct identities. They work together under the leadership of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa towards common objectives. That is how it evolved since January, 2015 when the change occurred. The Nugegoda rally was the beginning. A strong characteristic of it is the close collaboration among these different parties. They will contest elections under the SLPPs lotus bud symbol. There is no difference of opinion on those fundamental matters. 

We should work with these 16 people in order to evolve a strategy in Parliament against the government. It is obvious that the days of the government are numbered
QYet, there are reports about differences of opinion on the accommodation of 16 Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) MPs who defected from the government. What is your response
With regard to them, what is happening is very natural. There is no reason for anyone to be astonished. It is to be expected. These are people who strongly backed President Maithripala Sirisena and accepted office under him. They were part and parcel of the government which carried out policies bringing down the country to the brink of ruin. They came only after the public opinion became very clear from the results of the elections on February 10, 2018. What the younger people in the Joint Opposition feel is this. There are strong feelings in this regard. They attacked the SLPP. They belonged to the government that pursued the Rajapaksa family and the SLPP leadership. Therefore, these feelings are to be expected. 
However, there is the consideration that we should work with these 16 people in order to evolve a strategy in Parliament against the government. It is obvious that the days of the government are numbered. But, the various forces that installed this government are determined to get their agenda implemented during the short period available today. The chief item on that agenda is constitutional reforms. They want the government to deliver what it promised. The only way to thwart that exercise is to deprive the government of two-thirds in Parliament. Then, all these other initiatives become a nonstarter. For that, we have to receive people of the government into the rank of the opposition. From that point of view, the arrival of these 16 MPs is a salutatory move. It makes sense to work together with them in Parliament towards that objective. 
The 16-member group is not a homogeneous group. Some members like Susil Premajayantha and John Seneviratne only said they would back the candidate to be nominated by Mahinda Rajapaksa. Others in the group said they were staying with the SLFP. They continue to accept the leadership of President Sirisena. There is a great deal of confusion.

The driving force will be Mahinda himself. Mahinda will spearhead and lead the campaign. There is no doubt about the results

QSome of JO MPs did not vote for MP Sudarshani Fernandopulle to be appointed as the Deputy Speaker. She is a member of the 16-member group. Why is it
It is not a division with regard to the course of action to be followed at elections. One from the 16 member group came over. All the members who are with Mahinda Rajapaksa were requested to support. They had certain reservations about doing it. It is human feeling. In politics, one has to conquer these feelings, though. 
QYou said earlier that the JO would launch a campaign targeting the dissolution of Parliament for snap general elections. How are you going to do it
The situation in the country is totally chaotic. The government is dysfunctional even at the basic level. It is simply not possible to go that way. The President is publicly attacking the Prime Minister. The two parties are pointing fingers at each other for the failure of Yahapalana administration. In the midst of all these public bickering, it is the people of the country who have to pay a heavy price. It is quite evident that nothing useful to the people can be accomplished by the government that is so much at loggerheads. The need of the hour is a fresh beginning. That is possible only after a parliamentary election. The rupee value has depreciated to 160 against the dollar. The most acute hardships are with regard to the cost of living. There is the crippling burden of taxation. There is the ever burgeoning expenditure for luxuries for the Ministers and government MPs. There is absolutely no restraint for that. Let the people have the opportunity of deciding for themselves! 
It is legally possible in terms of the 19th Amendment. That is by the adoption of a resolution by Parliament with two thirds. All the parties in the opposition are of that view. People are waiting to cast their vote and throw the government out of office. The clamour for a general election is going to be very popular. There is very strong opposition to the alienation of public assets. All these factors are there. 
QSome opposition parties such as the JVP and the Tamil National Alliance (TNA) co-operate with the government overtly or covertly. How practical is it for you to muster two-thirds for dissolution of Parliament when the government has enough numbers to block it in that sense
All these parties have significant fissures within them. The UNP is also not monolith at all. Some of the younger party members have made public statements. They are profoundly dissatisfied with the party and its leadership. They want fundamental changes. When the No-confidence motion against Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe was brought, the feeling was that they could not allow their rivals to throw their Prime Minister out. That is contrary to the culture and discipline of the party. They said they would rally around the Prime Minister to defend him. Yet, there was one condition. They said there should be radical changes in the party soon after that. The Prime Minister makes such promises when he is in difficulty. He forgets all of them when he is strong. This has resulted in huge disillusionment within the rank and file of the UNP. 

The President is publicly attacking the Prime Minister. The two parties are pointing fingers at each other for the failure of Yahapalana administration
The situation in the TNA is even more acute. The TNA has dropped 34 percent of their votes from the parliamentary elections in August, 2015 to the local polls on February 10, 2018. Now, of course, the drop could be even greater. How are they going to face their people in the North After September, this year, the chief instrument of devolution ceases to exist. The east does not have a provincial council for eight months. 
The TNA is losing ground there. The other elements are coming up there. We have sharp differences of views between the TNA and Northern Province Chief Minister C.V. Wigneswaran. The Chief Minister is backed by other forces. It is in everyones interest to see the dissolution of Parliament. We will work towards that with the single-minded sense of focus. 
QThe Presidential Elections is scheduled to be conducted at the end of next year. Why do you agitate for a parliamentary election in between
That is still 16 months ahead of now. The harm that can be inflicted on the country during that period is enormous. People simply cannot make ends meet. There is a limit to human patience. The people cannot put up with this state of anarchy for a year and half. It is a long period in which they have to suffer. 
QThere are different names being mentioned about prospective candidates. What do you think about it as the chairman of SLPP
All this talk about the identity of the presidential candidate is a red herring across the trail. That is to divert public attention from other burning issues. The focus should be on current issues. Former President Rajapaksa said that, at the right time, he would decide who should be the candidate. He would announce it at the right time.
The driving force will be Mahinda himself. Mahinda will spearhead and lead the campaign. There is no doubt about the results. 
QIf you were in office, what would you do regarding the bond scam
First and foremost, we will ensure that Arjun Mahendran is brought back to the country. The government is not interested in doing it at all. On the contrary, the government wants him to live in Singapore or elsewhere as long as he wants. The Prime Minister said, as in the media reports, he had no knowledge of where Mahendran was. 
His presence is necessary to recover money lost to the country. Arjun Aloysius and Kasun Palisena did not do it on their own. 
When the No-confidence motion against Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe was brought, the feeling was that they could not allow their rivals to throw their Prime Minister out


QAs for the 20th Amendment brought by the JVP, there is objection to it today. Yet, the political parties, starting from 1994, have vowed to abolish the executive presidency. Now, are you opposed to it Why is it
Not that we are opposed to it. There is a parliamentary process at the moment considering all aspects of constitution making. It is a holistic process. It is not considering one component in isolation. The current 20th Amendment deals with one element. That is executive presidency. That is not realistic. If you take it away without doing anything to the totally flawed electoral reforms in operation at present, the result will involve a huge distortion. Executive presidency is one stabilizing factor. It has downsides though. In order to strengthen Parliament and effective governance taking place, you must deal with the issue of electoral reforms.

Attempts by wildlife officials, dy. min. to save cow elephant fail
	
An exhaustive attempt by Wildlife officers assisted by Wildlife Deputy Minister Palitha Thewarapperuma to save a female elephant who had been injured by a trap gun in Horowpothana, failed as the animal succumbed to the injuries it had sustained at the hands of poachers.
The villagers had spotted the injured elephant near the Diyathiththawewa in Horowpothana and informed the wildlife department. A team of wildlife officers and the deputy minister spent several hours trying to save the animal but to no avail.
The deputy minister had even taken the unusual step of bring Buddhist monks from a nearby temple and had them chant 'Seth Pirith', hoping to bring healing to the animal. However, all attempts failed and the animal died on Sunday. Later wildlife officers and Deputy Minister Thewarapperuma arranged to bury the animal with funeral rites being administered with the Maha Sangha also present. (Pathum Dharshana)

Cabinet endorses reparation bill
	
As part of implementing the resolutions by the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC), the Cabinet endorsed a Bill to be enacted by Parliament for the payment of reparation in respect of war-affected and missing persons.
However, there was resistance within the Cabinet for the reparation formula which includes benefits to families of former LTTE combatants. The formula has been worked out by Rehabilitation, Resettlement and Hindu Religious Affairs Minister D.M. Swaminathan.
Some ministers including Patali Champika Ranawaka opposed benefits being provided to families of ex-LTTE cadres.
The Cabinet memorandum was prepared by the Foreign Affairs Ministry.
The UNHRC, in its resolution on Sri Lanka called for proposals for transitional justice in Sri Lanka. The establishment of the Office of Missing Persons was one such step.(Kelum Bandara)

Coming event casting its shadow
	

A leader of a minor political party, a constituent of yahapalanaya coalition, was a guest at a function held at the official residence of the former strongman the other day.

The function over, the minor party leader lingered to have a heart-to-heart chat with the former strongman.
Expressing his general unhappiness over the affairs in the country and the government, the party leader said: This government is rudderless. Theres none in control. There were problems during your time too. But there was someone to give a hearing to these problems. Now there is none to whom we can tell our problems!
The party leader who had a lengthy discussion with the former strongman bade adieu to the former strongman promising to meet him again, they say.

DFCC Bank recently announced that it will continue to run its SahayaHamuwa workshops in 2018, which focuses on aiding and uplifting micro, small and medium size businesses and entrepreneurs across the island.

## Title: Diplomacy and Foreign Judges
## Section: Opinion

Diplomacy and Foreign Judges
	
Could there be a keener pleasure than to sit around a fire and discuss diplomacy with a diplomat Of course, there is no fire; just coffee, and that only in plastic cups, which nevertheless provides the fire, inside, instead of outside, but with the same cheering and relaxing power.
Its after the coffee break at the Education Institute and Ambassador Palihakkara has invited questions. You said we cannot operate in isolation. But we have opposed the intervention of foreign judges in HR issues. As a diplomat how do you view this a student asks. Palihakkara makes it clear that he views it with disfavour, and concern and has no doubts that the same degree of disfavour would be forthcoming from every country, were such a thing suggested to them. 
I have probably spent around 20, 25 years at the HR Commission and the UN and Council and I have not seen a single country who wants foreign judges to come. I think the foreign judges are being suggested on the basis that the judiciary of that country is not independent. So if you show that your judiciary is independent, no one can ask foreign judges to come. Personally, I think having foreign judges will create more problems than solutions.
If we are up to showing that our judiciary is independent, we can take a firm stand that our judiciary meets international standards. So we dont needforeign Judges
Not everyone feels this way. I have met Sri Lankan patriots who feel differently. I have always argued; how do we set up a credible mechanism to inquire into this, credible to the Tamils, credible to the rest of the world, and credible to ourselves I dont think you can do that exclusively with a local system. You need to bring credibility to the system you are setting up by bringing in an international panel of experts to preside over, but dont lose control over the process. I think it can be done. Foreign judges are basically judges who will apply the law, Godfrey Gunatilleke, Chairman Emeritus, Marga Institute said to me in 2015, when I interviewed him for Sunday Island.
Under the influence of that memory, I question Mr. Palihakkara. I think this whole issue of being against foreign judges goes against the grain because theres a huge credibility issue in countries like SL, third world countries. Credibility is only achieved when foreign assistance is obtained, I begin coherently enough but muddy the waters somewhat by mentioning, Scotland Yard assistance, foreign coaches, foreign technical assistance as fait accompli arguments in favour of foreign judges.
There is a distinction between technical assistance and judges, Mr. Palihakkara asserts gently. He is all for getting foreign technical assistance for forensic and investigative activity and think it will enhance credibility and efficiency. Getting foreign judges for judicial verdict is different. Obviously, the former commissioner of the Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission feels strongly about this. Perhaps its a matter of national pride and honour, though the ambassador never puts it in such emotional terms. There have been a lot of complaints about the judiciary, I agree with you. But we must rectify it here. We must allow the judges to work independently, not intimidate them. Politicians should stop telephoning them. Those are the things we must do. You cant ask white gentlemen or ladies to come here and tell the judges that. You know our judges are literate people, educated, if they are allowed to work without telephone calls, intimidation and various other methods, they will work.
Yes definitely national pride is an issue here. But not the only issue which plagues Mr. Palihakkaras mind If you have foreign judges, there will be conflict, says this foreign service mandarin who became Foreign Secretary, Permanent Representative of Sri Lanka to the United Nations and retired as Governor of Northern Province. The idea of foreign judges according to Mr. Palihakkara generates too many open questions Personally, I think having foreign judges will create more problems than solutions. How are the foreign judges going to operate In conjunction with local judges or sitting in judgement of judgements delivered by local judges. Does our legal framework permit such things Do we have to enact new legislation or is it possible to get the legislation through parliament I remember in Cambodia they had foreign tribunals that was a failure. Some people criticized this for being a waste of UN money.
You know our judges are literate people, educated, if they are allowed to work without telephone calls, intimidation and various other methods, theywill work
Again, I have sat around a different fire and heard a different reaction to foreign judges, treating all anticipated problems as so much gristle to be cut away to reach the metaphorical meat- a solution to the credibility issues which would plague a purely domestic judicial process. 
Hybrid as given in the OHCHR report suggests something in which foreign judges will be nominated by them like in Cambodia and Lebanon. We wont have that. We wont have UNHRC nominating our judges. The choice is ours. It wont be hybrid in that sense. It will be hybrid in the sense that we will be bringing in international expertise to give credibility to this mechanism. I am with it, Godfrey Gunatilleke had said sitting around our interview fire. 
We wont have UNHRC nominating our Judges. The choice is ours. It wont be hybrid in that sense. It will be hybrid in the sense that we will be bringing in international expertise to give credibility to this mechanism
As I sit around this current fire and listen to Mr. Palihakkara, I am conflicted. How to break the deadlock between these two stances Whats the clinching argument Whats so wrong with foreign judges If they will help bridge the trust deficit why not have them What harm can they do, what danger do they inherently carry that no country will have them voluntarily Can the trust deficit be addressed without incurring this sort of danger

Yes, according to Mr. Palihakkara, if we are up to showing that our judiciary is independent, we can take a firm stand that our judiciary meets international standards. So we dont need foreign judges If we dont take this sort of firm stand, the ambassador cautions, our local human rights problems get internationalised. Foreign judges mean you are internationalizing it. 
Yet resolution A/HRC/RES/30/1 co-sponsored and presumably containing text pre-negotiated and agreed upon by Sri Lanka, Welcomes the recognition by the Government of Sri Lanka that accountability is essential to uphold the rule of law and to build confidence in the people of all communities of Sri Lanka in the justice system, notes with appreciation the proposal of the Government of Sri Lanka to establish a judicial mechanism with a special counsel to investigate allegations of violations and abuses of human rights and violations of international humanitarian law, as applicable; affirms that a credible justice process should include independent judicial and prosecutorial institutions led by individuals known for their integrity and impartiality; and also affirms in this regard the importance of participation in a Sri Lankan judicial mechanism, including the special counsels office, of Commonwealth and other foreign judges, defence lawyers and authorized prosecutors and investigators; 
According to Mr. Palihakkara however, this resolution does not render us optionless by mandating foreign judges. Its not obligatory. It says having foreign assistance and judges would be important. So the option is left here
The resolution being co-sponsored, doesnt it mean that Sri Lanka too has affirmed the importance of the participation in a Sri Lankan judicial mechanism of foreign judges It would appear not, to judge by the curt repudiation of the idea by the President of Sri Lanka in his January 21, 2016 interview with BBC Sinhala service, just months after Resolution 30/1. Displaying decisive body language and barely concealed impatience with even the suggestion of international participation or foreign judges in investigating HR violation allegations, the President stated that of the proposed measures by the UN HR Commission, they have to consider which would be in the governments power to adopt and which they wouldnt be able to implement. Admitting the governments clear acceptance of investigations into allegations of HR violations, the SL Head of State was categorical that ensuring fairness in such investigations should be done within a domestic judicial process, in accordance with SL constitution and without the participation of foreign judges, because they had no intention of importing foreign judges to ensure fairness. He will never agree to such a thing. He has faith in the Sri Lankan judiciary and the investigating bodies and officers within the terms of the constitution and a domestic mechanism. Even seeming to reject foreign investigative and forensic assistance, the President denied the need to import anyone from anywhere else. 
There are three things to remember about Resolution 30/1. It resulted from a collaborative approach; its text was worked out between USA, new government of Sri Lanka and other stakeholders, from a first draft by USA; and it was co-sponsored by SL.
SL seems to say, we are within our rights to reject those few recommendations that we were unhappy about at the time of the collaboration. As a resolution is not a treaty, we didnt feel it was necessary to make a delete-or else fuss about every point in the collaborated text
The SL interpretation of collaboration and co-sponsoring seems to be that there is no need for a collaborator to endorse and take responsibility for every point in the final collaborative/co-authored text. As long as the majority of the points are endorsed and complied with by the co-sponsoring, collaborating party, a collaborators/co-sponsors obligations can be considered fulfilled. As all collaborated texts are essentially compromises, SL seems to say, we are within our rights to reject those few recommendations that we were unhappy about at the time of the collaboration. As a resolution is not a treaty, we didnt feel it was necessary to make a delete-or else fuss about every point in the collaborated text. What we meant by affirming our collaboration as a co-sponsor is simply that overall, on the whole, for the most part, we are with Resolution 30/1, while retaining the right to disassociate ourselves from the unacceptable bits.
Evidently, countries have their ways of working within the UN system. Palihakkara tells us about Cuba, USA was trying to harass Cuba on the human rights count but they fought successfully against the UN resolutions because they put in place in their own country, very efficient judicial and law enforcement measures. And eventually the USA had to withdraw those resolutions from the Human Rights Council.
Sri Lankas difference I think to myself, seems to be that we dont fight against the USA led UN resolutions. We collaborate with them and co-sponsor them so that when and if, we, like Cuba, put in place in our own country, very efficient judicial and law enforcement measures, USA can feel a warm glow that it was a partner, a stakeholder in that positive transformation. But then, didnt USA feel a warm glow when Cuba was doing that, that it was USA resolutions that were driving positive change in Cuba Apparently not. They would just have felt defeated with every resolution they had to withdraw. 
Ambassador Palihakkara tells us that when he left New York in 2009, there was a USA sponsored resolution in the UN General Assembly, proposing an embargo against Cuba that only four out of the 193 UN member states supported. Cuba achieved this according to Mr. Palihakkara through the stance: In our country, we may be poor but we dont have torture, people dont disappear. You can come and see. 
If we are ever able to take up such a stance, we wont have defeated Resolution 30/1, we wouldnt have defeated USA. But what will such no defeating entail The simplest way to make USA feel a warm glow could be to just do as it wishes. Is asserting our sovereignty within a collaborative approach harder than in a confrontational approach, where SL like Cuba would seek to defeat a UN resolution by proving positive things These are things I dont ask Mr. Palihakkara because its time to go home.

MP Dullas Alahapperuma said social media websites had become a threat to the Government and that it was planning to introduce laws to ban social media websites.
He told a news briefing held today that the Government had made several attempts to ban social media websites but it was unsuccessful because the people kept agitating against such moves.
Government has now realized that social media websites were an obstacle to their survival and that is why it is attempting to introduce laws to ban social media in Sri Lanka, the MP said. (Sheain Fernandopulle)

Existence or Extinction Choice cant be clearer
	
The voter at cross roads; It is a choice between existence and extinction now
Findings were extremely injurious to the Yahapalanaya concept
Ranils ambition now seems almost dead
The current administration does nothave anything to bragabout
It is a choice between existence and extinction
Findings were extremely injurious to the Yahapalanaya concept

Ignore the noise and follow yourown choice.   ~ Anonymous
When one looks back on the pros and cons of the decision taken by the people in the 2015 Presidential Election and the mandate it carried, after two-and-half-years in power, the current administration does not have anything to brag about except one outstanding accomplishment of theirs.
With all the alleged corruption and ineffective management of the countrys ailing economy, the very introduction of transparency aspect of governance where the government partys own members were taken to task when found in want of proper and accountable conduct.
Dismissal of Ravi Karunanayake from the Ministry of Finance in the wake of the conclusion of the Presidential Commission on the so-called Bond-Scam issue is one conspicuous example of such transparency and accountability in governance.
However, the optics of such a finding and what followed the findings were extremely injurious to the Yahapalanaya concept the Government boasted about.
In politics, its all optics, especially in the short run.
The failure on the part of the Prime Minister to realise this fundamental aspect of politics is astonishing given the length of years he has been playing this game of politics.
That is why most Governments, especially the Rajapaksa regime, during their tenure, swept such numerous cases, found to be manifestly authentic, under the proverbial carpet.
The following ready-reckoner would indicate in a nutshell the various atrocities brought upon the nation by the Rajapaksa clan:
Ready-reckoner of corruption, murders and intimidation by Rajapaksa and Company

November 9 and 10, 2012 Prison attack - 27 killed

While no exceptional defence should or would be made for the so-called Bond-Scam issue, a significant black mark against the current administration remains the Bond-Scam.
Furthermore, even before any judicial findings were concluded, the Minister who was allegedly responsible for the scam was removed by the Prime Minister and those who were alleged to have committed this horrendous white-collar crime were behind bars.
None of that sort happened during the regime of the Rajapaksa and Company.
During that time all the alleged perpetrators were free to roam the street corners crowded by political and financial thuggery and allowed to indulge in their favourite pastime of newly defined governance.
Galloping down the road to glory and self-enlargement with their masters, the leeches of the past regime played their own despicable game of power-politics to a sinister end.
In their game, the people were pawns and other insignificant pieces of trash. The deal makers and commission agents were the only VVIPs who could meet the Ministers and the King at their own behest.
Sajith is nursing his own ambition to be the leader of the UNP, yet a pathetic show of vacillation is no trait of sound leadership
While the voting public, who faithfully voted these caricatures of political trash into office successively in 2005 and 2009, unrelentingly supported the Rajapaksa and Company to an intolerable limit, the then Opposition led by the current Prime Minister was in their own messy circumstance.
Ranils leadership was challenged by a motivated group of second-tier leaders of the United National Party (UNP), led by Karu Jayasuriya and Sajith Premadasa.
As per reports obtained by the writer, while Karu Jayasuriya was willing to go and did go all the way, Sajith decided to go so far and no further.
This is an unbecoming conduct on the part of Sajith Premadasa.
Sajith is nursing his own ambition to be the leader of the UNP, yet a pathetic show of vacillation is no trait of sound leadership. On the other hand, Navin Dissanayake, albeit the fact that he left the UNP and joined the Rajapaksa regime during the time of the war, (Navins father, Gamini Dissanayake, was brutally bombed down by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Elam) after joining the UNP, is enjoying the support of a clear majority of UNP Parliamentarians.
When Parliamentarians ponder about their future leaders, there are three characteristics which stand out as crucial in determining that quality.
1. The leader should be a winner
2. He must possess decision-making capabilities, not vacillating
3. Inspire others. In all three categories, Navin Dissanayake is ahead of Sajith and the UNP Parliamentarians seem to have realised that.
Well, that is all events yet to come. There may well be, as the saying goes, many a slip between the cup and the lip. In whichever case, either Sajith or Navin is infinitely better than any member of the Rajapaksa clan.
For that matter, there is no second-tier leadership in either the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) or Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP).
The UNP can boast about a wealth of talent and experience in its second-tier: Sajith, Navin, Ruwan Wijewardene or Mangala Samaraweera could be miles ahead of any leader the SLFP or SLPP can field.
The UNP can boast about a wealth of talent and experience in its second-tier: Sajith, Navin, Ruwan Wijewardene or Mangala Samaraweera could be miles ahead of any leader the SLFP or SLPP can field
Looking back on the list of atrocities committed by the Rajapaksa clan- as illustrated in the above list- any one single member of the Rajapaksa family or its associates has disqualified himself or herself.
That is clear as crystal, one would say. That is the realistic picture that the current political landscape displays. Enveloped in a culture of corruption that has been taken hostage by politicians of all parties, enmeshed in dire straits of economic hardships and having come to terms with a degenerate lifestyle of being subservient to money and power, our people, in 2020, will again face a choice between realistic, decent and honest politics and perverted and debased practice of governance of the likes of the Rajapaksa-rule.
In whatever circumstances, Ranil Wickremesinghe, the incumbent Prime Minister and leader of the UNP cannot be just discounted as a non-entity.
His strengths purely lies in his experience as the leader of his party. However, the present coalition setup has managed to ruin Ranils image as a good manager of the countrys economy. On top of that, the infamous Bond-Scam and his close affinity towards Ravi Karunanayake also has helped in this downward path of Ranil Wickremesinghe.
But he does not seem to have given up on his ambition to be Sri Lankas next President. What seemed a few years ago a distant reality, Ranils ambition, as evidenced in the recently held Local Government elections, now seems
almost dead. In the clear context of a suitable candidate from the UNP to contest the next Presidential Election, Ranil, in fact, is behind Sajith Premadasa and Navin Dissanayake. The UNP, although it had a great history of bouncing back from near extinction, is now facing another frontier. In the international arena, populist politics is gaining grounds. Sri Lanka simply cannot escape from that political geography. In spite of history, the United National Party is now grappling with the geography of political thinking. A leader who can give the right expression to that prevailing current of politics would certainly have a better chance than any man or woman who is sinking intraditional politics.

He gave the green signal on time
	

On hearing about the plans being made by the Gang of 16 to hold a public meeting in the country, Number One had called for intelligence reports about the public reaction to this move.

Some reports he got said that some Blue party members and sympathizers including Provincial and local body members appeared wavering between two minds whether to attend the meeting or not.
Meanwhile, Number One who paid an official visit to the Matale area had paid a courtesy call on a prominent member of the Gang.
On the heels of this visit, a rumour said that all party members and sympathizers who were in a state of indecision about attending the meeting had received a green signal from Number One to attend it.
Following the green signal all those who were in two minds had attended the meeting, they say.

This tough-talking young Blue party Diyawanna member from the gem-rich district is said to be ever at loggerheads with a prominent woman politico from the same district known to be a spitfire. Both are now Pohottuwa stalwarts. And both are eyeing the chief purohita post in the province.

Now that the woman politico had become an obstacle to his immediate political ambition as well, the young politico had started attacking the former from every public platform.
On hearing that the young politico was overreacting to the challenge posed by the woman politico, the party senior in the district John the Silent, who happened to be the young mans political Guru as well, had sent for him and later admonished him to hold his fire against the lady.
Chastised, the young politico promised not to lash out at the lady again, they say.

His PR exercise backfired on him
	

There is a departmental head who seems to believe in the use of certain religious practices to discipline and humanize his own rank and file.

He has also made it a practice to convey birthday greetings to his subordinates as a PR exercise.
This departmental head had quite recently sent an SMS conveying his birthday greetings to a high ranking senior one.
However, the senior one had been harboring grudge against the departmental head for sitting on his promotion to the next higher rank for some time.
The senior one had sent a reply to the greetings by an SMS; this reply was a vitriolic comment rejecting the birthday greetings.
By the way, this SMS goes into history, they say, because it could be the first ever SMS sent to reject a birthday greetings message since the introduction of this innovation!

I funded my own election campaign: Ajith Perera
	
State Minister Ajith P Perera yesterday said he had used his own funds and funds borrowed from his family members for the election campaign and had not accepted any funds from Perpetual Treasuries Chief Arjun Aloysius or from anyone else.
Politicians carry out their campaigns using funds they get from various sources. However one cannot justify some of the methods used to generate funds. At the same time one cannot say that the habit of generating funds for campaigns through such means is correct all the time, the state minister admitted.
State Minister Perera said he had not accepted any money from anyone. I barely know Aloysius and have not met or spoken to him, he said. Asked whether he is prepared to provide an affidavit to this effect, he said it is not necessary as ones conscience is much more important. Is anyone required by law to submit affidavits saying he or she is not involved in any crime he questioned the media.
Further, he said persons have been charged with greater crimes that this is accusing others of accepting cheques from Aloysius. Some persons who have several court cases pending against them are accusing others of accepting cheques from Aloysius," he charged. (Yohan Perera)

The fate of 629 migrants on a rescue ship in the Mediterranean was in the balance last night amid fears of mutiny. 
Italy and Malta have both refused to let the vessel dock and charity workers said the passengers were becoming increasingly anxious and desperate. 
The rescuers had initially shielded the migrants from the knowledge that they were stranded in international waters. But, faced with a barrage of questions, they last night told them why they had been stuck at sea since Saturday night. 
Humanitarian workers desperately trying to calm tensions on board the Aquarius as food supplies dwindled.

In response to the news report published on a Tamil daily newspaper in Jaffna regarding a content of a meeting held between former President Mahinda Rajapaksa and outgoing US Ambassador Atul Keshap, the US Embassy today remained non-committal.
When the Daily Mirror inquired about the meeting, the Embassy said that the Ambassador met political leaders as a routine.
The Ambassador meets routinely with political leaders, civil society and community leaders. The Ambassador honours the confidence of private meetings and does not discuss the contents of such meetings publicly.
The Daily Mirror asked whether Ambassador Keshap had said, during the meeting, that the US and Western nations didnt welcome the prospects of Gotabhaya Rajapaksa contesting polls and becoming President of Sri Lanka.
The Daily Mirror also asked whether the Embassy sought a clarification from the Tamil daily on the news report.
The dbsjeyaraj.com said a news report had initially appeared on Jaffna based Tamil daily Kaalaikkathir edited by Senior Tamil Journalist Nadesapillai Vithyatharan, on June 12 about the said meeting, where Ambassador Keshap had reportedly said the US and the Western did not welcome the prospects of Gotabhaya Rajapaksa contesting and becoming the President of Sri Lanka.

DPA, 12th JUNE, 2018- Just hours after concluding his historic talks with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, US President Donald Trump expressed optimism that denuclearization on the Korean Peninsula would happen quickly and that he and Kim would help write a new chapter between our nations.
As history has proven, adversaries can indeed become friends, Trump told reporters in Singapore on Tuesday after a day of meetings with Kim.
In an immediate gesture toward this, Trump said the US military would stop conducting war games aimed at North Korea.
The drills, which the US routinely holds along with the militaries of South Korea and other countries, exacerbate tensions between Washington and Pyongyang, said Trump, who added that halting them also will save a tremendous amount of money.

Writing an article about the happenings in this country is becoming next to impossible!!! Those who lack the courage to do what is right; and there are SO MANY OF THEM, will always find a philosophy to justify it!!! We simply cannot count the number of wrongdoers who are continually being brought to Court and sent away!!!
Recording of evidence never ends; we have lost count of the number!!! We continually read Mahanama and Dissanayake re-remanded, Rangajeewa and Lamahewa re-remanded, on an almost daily basis people are being produced in Court but NOTHING FINALISED
Produced and re-produced, remanded and re-remanded!!! WHEN AND WHERE IS THIS TOMFOOLERY GOING TO END PERHAPS IT WOULD NOT BE POLITICALLY EXPEDIENT WHEN TRUTH BECOMES A VICTIM TO POLITICS!!! The count on the Perpetual Treasuries List is increasing by the day!!! THE ALL IMPORTANT NAMES ARE NOT FORTHCOMING THOUGH!!! WE WONDER WHY

ILLS OF THE GOP

The Educated One says the UNP will never defend thieves, who made Ravi K the first Minister of Finance in this regime The one who claims MY TASK IS TO GIVE NEW HOPE TO ALL UNP MEMBERS AND MILLIONS OF OUR VOTERS Where we ask is the hope he has given to the millions of parents who still find it impossible to get their children into schools Does that not matter, or is that not one of his priorities As the new General Secretary of the Grand Old Party, he is going to solve ALL THE ILLS OF THE PARTY IN ONE FELL SWOOP!!! The UNP should consider itself privileged to have such a capable General Secretary!!! He is going to make the Impossible Possible!!! We will still be around to watch his stellar performance!!!

Not so healthy Situ

The Healthy One who returned recently after capturing a post at the UN is such a humanitarian that he refused point blank to go into the overcrowded ward at the Hector Kobbekaduwa Hospital in Dambulla!!! Those poor women have no room TO EVEN SIT ON THE FLOOR, IT IS SO HORRIBLY OVERCROWDED, BUT DID ANYONE CARE

Igp Step In Please
The Traffic jams and Traffic Cops  yes, we have been taught to give merit where merit is due but the Traffic Cops of our country deserve NO MERIT for the inhuman delays and punishment they put us through, simply because they have absolutely NO IDEA HOW TO DIRECT TRAFFIC!!!
THEY MAKE THE CRUCIAL MISTAKE OF FIRST PUTTING OUT THE TRAFFIC LIGHTS AND THEN TRYING TO DIRECT TRAFFIC!!! THEIR SENSE OF DIRECTION SADLY POINTS ONLY IN ONE DIRECTION!!! SO GOD HELP US ALL!!!
If these idiots just leave the Traffic Lights on, THERE IS A SENSE OF DIRECTION AND A SMOOTH FLOW OF TRAFFIC!!! Perhaps it is time the IGP stepped in and brought a sense of direction to the lives of these misguided Policemen so that they will not continue to display their ignorance and inconvenience the public, like they do!!!

Who cares
As I have said before, we live in a world of declining moral values!!! They are tinkered and tampered with to the detriment of society.
Sadly, our Sri Lankans, in general, seem to have lost their sense of values!!! The saddest and most detrimental part is that they have no politicians, no one at the top to guide them in what is right!!! Road repairs are being carried out in the daytime, when it is time for people to go home!!! The end result is the general public is inconvenienced but no one cares!!!
Huge empty water tanks are left at random on the roads; near the parks, no one knows the purpose they serve, more importantly, no one cares!!! When it rains these tanks fill with water and breed mosquitoes, the mosquitoes, in turn, bring in the dreaded dengue and other fevers!!! Yet, no one cares; the empty tanks are just left standing!!! The other menace is garbage; our streets, highways and byways are polluted with garbage!!! Does anyone care Is there any punishment meted out to those who irresponsibly dump garbage
The reason for all this decadence is total lack of discipline!!! No one to impose discipline, no one to take action where action is required, so the people have also fallen into this attitude of WHO CARES
There is no value attached to anything, whether it is in homes, schools, offices, public places; values are declining rapidly and falling to dangerously low levels!!! It is indeed a shame that the majority of Sri Lankans have lost their sense of self-worth!!! Sri Lankans, in general, used to be proud of what they wore, how they dressed, what they ate, how they went around, what they talked about. Now no one seems to care, it is really sad!!! More importantly, when a new product is introduced, irrespective of what the product is, the first lot you get is super but, as soon as they know the product has caught on, BANG goes the quality and no one cares about that!!!
Why are our people so lackadaisical; why is it that maintaining QUALITY IS NOT IMPORTANT ANY MORE ONE RECENT INCIDENT IN THE WAKE OF DENGUE WAS THE CITRONELLA PANGIRI THEL JOSS STICKS GUARANTEED TO DRIVE AWAY THE MOSQUITOES!!! IN ALL FAIRNESS IT WAS SUPER, YOU LIT ONE AND THE AROMA PERVADED THE WHOLE HOUSE!!! IT WAS SO EFFECTIVE, NOW YOU LIGHT EVEN TWO AND NOTHING HAPPENS!!! HOW QUICKLY DID THAT DETERIORATE Why do our Sri Lankans find it so easy to compromise on QUALITY Shouldnt we be proud of the product we sell, shouldnt we be proud that we are giving our fellow human beings a product of VALUE Why stoop to devalue the product we sell Why do we find it so easy to deceive our own countrymen

Oh that one hundred days

People are naturally taking their cue from the politicians, from what is happening around them!!! All we read about are the Udayangas, the Jaliyas, the Mahendrans and so many others who have all been allowed to get away!!!
WHY, WE ASK IS IT TAKING SO LONG, SO VERY LONG FOR JUSTICE TO BE SERVED!!! THERE DEFINITELY SEEMS TO BE SOME SECRET HIDDEN AGENDAS!!! IT IS ABOUT TIME THE GOVERNMENT IF YOU CAN CALL IT THAT; REALIZES THAT YOU CAN FOOL SOME OF THE PEOPLE SOME OF THE TIME, BUT NOT ALL THE PEOPLE ALL THE TIME!!! It wont be long before they have to come to the people again and then they would be in for the shock of their lives!!! Perhaps then they will realize THEY WERE THE FOOLS!!! Now they are trying to talk us into believing that there is this highly publicized 100-Day Programme, apparently drafted by Eminent Persons!!!
One of our eminent Buddhist Priests said the 100-Day Programme has been copied from a USA Programme!!!
Be that as it may, we are constrained to ask why it took over three years for them to even talk about a 100-Day Programme!!!
More importantly, what did they hope to achieve in these 100 days It would be interesting to find out!!!

The former strongman chaired a party meeting the other day.

The meeting over, a few faithfuls remained with their boss for a chit-chat. During the small talk that ensued, the former strongman confided in his loyalists a prediction made about his political future by a prominent astrologer in South Asia. He told me that I would go out of power in 2015, but would make a comeback after 2018.
The first to react to this revelation was a stocky one who made it to Diyawanna from a district close to Colombo. Sir, didnt that astrologer predict that you would be the Prime Minister again
The question seemed to have put all others ill at ease. They were looking at each other with a frown and the former strongman eased the tense moment with a loud guffaw.

Deputy Minister Ranjan Ramanayake had commented on the Indian film Kaalaa where he had criticized Indian director Pa. Ranjit and his movie Kaalaa which features Superstar Rajinikanth.
Please dont ruin your career by acting in Ranjits films, I am telling you this as a fan of yours. I also have the right to comment as a fan, Ramanayake said in a recent statement.
The story of the movie is about a politician, who promises to clean up India and grabs lands belonging to people once he came to power.
This concept is good but a superstar such as Rajinikanth should not act in such a movie, Ramanayake, who is also an actor, said.
If a Sri Lankan watches this movie he would think it is about former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa, Ramanayake added.
A video clip in which Ramanayake criticizing the Indian movie maker and commenting on the Indian superstar has been aired by the Indian media and it is reported that Indian superstar and the movie director are being criticized by a Sri Lankan Actor.
Asked whether Rajinikanth or Director Ranjit had responded to his comments, Mr Ramanayake said both had not responded yet.
This is the latest drama, which the Deputy Minister had got into as he was seen talking to astrologer Sumanadasa asking him whether he advised former Defence Secretary when the latter was constructing a house.
The astrologer denied it. At another instance, he got his uncle Professor Carlo Fonseka to tell the media how he funded his nephews election campaign. (Yohan Perera)

Recover monies plundered through rackets!
	
When the officials of the Attorney Generals Department first revealed that a member of Parliament had received one million rupees from a subsidiary company of Perpetual Treasuries Ltd. (PTL) headed by Arjun Aloysius- who has been remanded after being implicated in the Central Bank bond scandal- they also revealed that a VIP had also received the same amount of money from thesame source. 
According to the B- Report submitted to Courts the Parliamentarian who obtained money from Aloysius was none other than former Sports Minister Dayasiri Jayasekara.

Then, a few days later it was revealed that State Minister Sujeewa Senasinghe had also received money from one of Aloysiuss companies. He had received three million rupees, according to the Attorney Generals Department. On the same day it was also revealed that Arjuna Mahendran. who was the Central Bank Governor when the scandal took place, also received Rs. 3.2 million from the PTL boss. 
Aloysius giving money to Mahendran under normal circumstances cannot be faulted as the former is the latters son-in-law. But here, it is important because Mahendran had been accused of passing information on the controversial bond transaction that had been carried out on February 27, 2015 to Aloysius, one of the primary dealers of that transaction. Therefore it might amount to be a kick-back for insider dealing. Yet, that deal is also gradually being obscured by the revelationabout Senasinghe. 
Senasinghes defence seems to be very weak in this regard. He had said that he wasnt aware that Aloysius had offered funds to his election campaign and argues that the funds received from the company linked to Aloysius months after the 2015 General Elections were meant for the same election. The transaction seems to be further suspicious as he had written a book justifying the controversial bond transaction. 
Jayasekara had stated that he wasnt the only Parliamentarian to receive money from PTL. His claim that 118 people had been recipients of Aloysius money took wings and some politicians and the media started to talk about a list of 118 MPs contained in the Bond Commission report. Then the Convener of the Voice Against Corruption and JVP provincial councillor Wasantha Samarasinghe said it was not 118, but 166 recipients who were on Aloysius pay list. Finally The Speaker of the Parliament Karu Jayasuriya put an end to all these speculations, saying that there was no such list in the Bond Commission report. 
The whole episode has confused the people of the country while politicians were politicising the issue. This isnt a matter that should be taken lightly or taken as a political football as it might be the largest financial fraud to have taken place in Sri Lankan history and the funds plundered by the scammers belonged to people of all
political parties. 
This time it was exposed because the President and the Prime Minister represent two political parties. Had this been a Government with a President and a Prime Minister from the same party, this matter also would have been easily swept under the carpet. Hence all those involved even in a remote way should be exposed and brought to book, while taking measures to recover the public funds plundered. 
Therefore, if the contents of the Bond Commission report do not hinder the court proceedings on the matter, it must be presented in Parliament and made a public document, putting an end to all speculations, irrespective of who is going to be affected by it. And also President Maithripala Sirisena should bring in forthwith the three Bills he promised to provide for the recovery of the monies plundered through such highprofile rackets.

Responsible Fashion Movement presents the 2nd Hackathon  The Making of the Green Gene
	
The Responsible Fashion Movement launched their second Hackathon last month, under the theme THE MAKING OF THE GREEN GENE in association with the Hirdaramani Group. The aim of this hackathaon is to hack the process and create a solution around denim-based products. This is part of the Responsible Fashion Movement.
The Responsible Fashion Movement has a global agenda to impose progressive thinking, where mindsets are changed, ethical practices implemented and fashion consumers are made aware of their choices. It is an action point to bring about Responsibility, Responsiveness and Accountabilityto the fashion and design industryto create a good and responsible fashion ethos, which should become the 'new norm' in fashion design. As before, the objective behind the Fashion Hackathon is to involve design students, designers and industry stakeholders to bring in functionality and practicality based on the knowledge imparted in the forums that preceded it.
Responsible Fashion Hackathons started late last year with the first project named as The making of the Green Tee, part 1. This involved design students from a universities and fashion schools attempting to create the greenest t0-shirt possible based on the technology available. The results of this were presented to a panel of international designers at the First Responsible Fashion Summit.
The second edition, The Making of the Green Gene, will see its participants attempt to create a pair of Jeans or a product that uses denim using waste fabric from the Hirdaramani manufacturing plant. Participants will use waste fabric from 4 categorized waste baskets, in order to create a product that will have the strongest environmental impact.
These hackathons are aimed at creating a culture of innovative design solutions among design students and how amazing would it be to see a generation of green thinking designers in Sri Lanka who have solutions to global garment issues. Not many people know that a teeshirt as basic as it maybe can consume upto 2000 litres of water, equivalent to an individuals annual water need. These are issues. And We want Sri Lanka to be a shining example of Responsible Fashion. Says Ajai V Singh, Founder of The Responsible Fashion Movement
The Hirdaramani Group is one of the leading apparel manufacturers in Sri Lanka. In response to addressing the growing concerns of fashion and its environmental impact, they conducted an in-depth study into the impact of denim on the environment, mapping it from the cotton farming stage to the retail and post-consumer stage.
"Responsible Fashion Hackathon is a unique program by the Responsible Fashion Movement, it is focused on creating solutions to global issues while engaging and involving young people. For Hirdaramani group Denim is a key product category and we encourage innovation and design solutions. We are happy to partner the Responsible fashion Movement which aims to showcase Sri Lanka as a Responsible Fashion destination. This is probably the first such denim hackathon in Asia. We look forward to more, says AroonHirdaramani, Director Hirdaramani Group.
The key participants of this years hackathon will comprise of 7 teams of students from the National Institute of Business Management (NIBM), University of Moratuwa and Raffles Design Institute Colombo. The teams are comprised of young Sri Lankan designers aiming to create solutions in the form of creating jeans from waste fabric from the Hirdaramani manufacturing plant. The jeans created will be evaluated and one team will be declared a winner of this hackathon. The winner will be adjudged based on their creations conformity to the 6 impact points, namely Design, Fabric, Production, Logistics, Retail and Dispose. The winner will then go on to present their jeans at the Responsible Fashion Summit set to take place next month at Shangri-La Hotel, Colombo. The student will receive the opportunity to have their design manufactured, marketed and retailed globally.

Shooting at Kiriwehera: suspect identified
	
Asela Lakshman Bandara, former Chief Kapu Mahathaya of the Mahasen Devalaya of the Kataragama Kirivehera Temple was identified as the suspect involved in the shooting in which Kiriwehera Chief Incumbent Ven. Kobawaka Damminda Thera and another monk were injured, the Police said today.
They said the suspect was identified following an investigation carried out by eight special police teams.
Kobawaka Damminda Thera and another monk were injured when three gunmen opened fire at them on Tuesday night. Ven. Kobawaka Damminda is undergoing treatment at a private Hospital in Colombo.
The Senior Police officer said a Honda Vezel registered as UP CAG 8531, which had been used in the shooting, was recovered from the former Kapu Mahathayas house.
He said the suspects involved with the shooting had been identified and that they had fled the area.
He said that according to investigations the shooting had taken place due to a dispute over the ownership of the Mahasen Devalaya in Kataragama.
Ven. Kobawaka Damminda Thera took over the management of the Mahasen Devalaya from the Kapu Mahathaya after the Thera detected misappropriation of funds at the Devalaya recently.
However, the Kapu Mahathaya had then filed a lawsuit in court claiming ownership of the Devalaya. But the court ruled that the Devalaya belongs to Ven. Kobawaka Damminda.
Meanwhile, Police Spokesman SP Ruwan Gunasekera said that eight Police teams were investigating the incident under the direction of the Tangalle Division SP Laksiri Geethal.
Two Police personnel and four Civil Security Department personnel were with the Damminda Thera at the time of the shooting.
However, they were armed at the time of the incident.
The injured monks were admitted to the Kataragama District Hospital and were later transferred to the Hambantota Base Hospital. (Darshana Sanjeewa)

## Title: Sovereignty: Sold Out !

Sovereignty: Sold Out !
	
If anybody still needed proof that the representatives who claimed to be holding the legislative, executive and judicial powers of the people have turned their backs on them and have pursued a path of individual well-being, the developments during the past two weeks would have furnished enough evidence. All three wings of governance are packed with people who are corrupt, incapable and self-centred. The legislature has been sold to multi billion scammers while the executive remains so engrossed in a battle for survival and future preservation. The Judiciary, well, they need a lot of mettle to win the confidence that has been lost with regard to public perspective. 
Imagine the scenario when the former President says that the PM calls Prez a rogue and vice versa; that 118 have been called rogues while the fact that he himself was called a rogue once, which led to his ignominious removal, is forgotten. The rub is that he doesnt say that he isnt a rogue. Simply that it has now been forgotten that he was branded a rogue by the present governing lot. After all, how can the pot call the kettle black 
The parliamentarians who have been in the payroll of Bond scammers think it a trivial matter that they received cheques from these dubious businessmen
On whose sideare they 
Joining the parliamentary debate on the ETI Fixed Deposit crisis, the JVP Leader asked one crucial question i.e. when it comes to the rights of the deposit holders of ETI and their group of companies as opposed to the interests of the Directors and owners of those companies, on whose side the public representatives were This is a question that might sound redundant in a country where the representatives do champion the rights of the public. Yet things are so different in this nick of the woods, isnt it 
The parliamentarians who have been in the payroll of Bond scammers think it a trivial matter that they received cheques from these dubious businessmen for their election campaigning. They sound as if campaigning for elections was an act of public charity done with a meritorious heart and not for themselves and their benefit. Let us remind them that using that money for their election campaign is as bad as using it to buy a vehicle or a plot of land; a personal favour or benefit. 
The top three national leaders of this country have lost their credibility beyond reparation, but do not seem to have the decency to admit it. All three are like the proverbial king who walked naked in public yet feigned to be ceremoniously dressed with the most precious of garments. All three are very old, worn out and out of sync with regard to what this nation needs to pull itself out of the socio political and economic quagmire it has fallen into. A fresh face with a non political mindset aimed at developing this country while not sacrificing the hard won liberties for a democratic way of life is a burning need of the hour. They have not set up a credible second string leadership, either, a thing they seem to consider a threat and anathema to their interest of coming or remaining in power. 
The way politics are done, or more aptly put, played, has not taken the vast segments of our society anywhere; a superficial increase in per capita income is a misnomer created by highly concentrated wealth in a select few. Then again that filthy lucre finds itself in the corridors of power, as revelations in the case against Arjun Aloysius et al fallen into indicates clearly. 
What the law abiding citizen submits, the wealthy manipulates by a sleightof hand
The list becomes longer
While The Speaker has agreed to reveal the names of those representatives of the people who have had telephone conversations with those dubious individuals, while being members of the COPE committee and thus being privy to some of the highly sensitive details with regard to investigations, he, nevertheless refuses that there is a list of individuals at high places, which the media says includes Ministers, Parliamentarians, from both sides of the divide, Public servants, Police officers etc. who are in the payroll of big time gamers. 
Investigations are revealing the true nature of politics in particular and governance in general; its clear that what turns the wheels of these public representatives is the ill gotten and filthy lucre
Investigations are revealing the true nature of politics in particular and governance in general; its clear that what turns the wheels of these public representatives is the ill gotten and filthy lucre and not the public aspirations by any stretch of the imagination. 
As I pointed out in the last column, the threat posed by armed militancy both in the North and the South to the sovereignty of this nation is now replaced by a more sinister and illusive assailant. Those who are armed with hoards of ill-gotten cash and wealth have found in roads into the very heart of governance. The betrayal of the peoples aspiration by the parliamentarians and ministers is surely, but the tip of the iceberg.

Might of filthy lucre
Might seems to be the norm that twists the hands of those who are perched comfortably and ceremoniously in the legislative, executive and judicial wings of the state. Unlike the DJV or the Black Tigers who attacked security installations of the state with military hardware, these illusive assailants are already inside the sacred temple of governance, either by themselves or through their cronies. They hold the strings, they stage-manage the political game and call all the cards! 
People going to vote for their representatives at parliament and lower bodies, their extravagant and almost subservient respect to courts, their submission to law enforcing agencies are, but one great farce which is played by the public to fool themselves. Where the small man trembles, the mighty scorn with disdain; what the law abiding citizen submits, the wealthy manipulates by a sleight of hand. The ceremonious formalities of the rule of law are nothing but a box office level comedy!
The top three national leaders of this country have lost their credibility beyond reparation, but do not seem to have the decency to admit it.

Cleansing the Parliament
There is very little doubt that politicians of all size shape and colour, whether blue, green or red have eaten the filthy morsels that fall from the tables of the shady billionaires. If one trembled at the figure of 118, as the number of MP s who have been happy recipients of the perpetual lucre, I am quite sure, there is more to come. When Dear Old DEW, the former COPE Chairman, makes a fervent appeal to cleanse the Parliament of these scumbags who are corrupt to the core, I hope , the noble gentleman, knows the magnitude of the task at hand. In my mind it would take nothing short of the purges conducted during the Stalinist Era ( with wrong motives and sinister repercussions, of course) to cleanse our nation of this dirt, that man our august institutions of governance. 
But the Stalin who lurks in the dark, scares the hell out of a lot of us, doesnt he By us I do not simply mean the ordinary citizen. Did I

Thiran  Bhavan feud threatens a split in the party
	

The main political party in the North is too plagued by internal dissention these days, they say.

There had been a recent attempt by a Bhavan lord commanding much media clout to oust the partys virtual second-in-command Thiran.
The Bhavan lord while quietly planning the ouster had given phone calls to several Diyawanna members of the party and one of the call recipients had taken the trouble to send a recording of the call to Thiran. Fireworks in the party had followed with the cat getting out of the bag!
The Thiran- Bhavan feud has led to a split in the party right down the middle, they say.

Tusker Deega Danthu-I, shot by trap gun; Wildlife
	
Deega Danthu I, one of the elephants with the longest tusks roaming the Kala Wewa National Park, was found with gunshot injuries on Monday, Galkiriyagama Wildlife Warden D. Ranasinghe said.
Speaking to the Daily Mirror, he said the Galkiriyagama Wildlife Department had been informed by several fishermen in the Kala Wewa area about a wounded tusker, which was limping.
Deega Danthu was one of the 18 tuskers living in the Kala Wewa National Park.
As soon as we got the message, a team led by Galkiriyagama Wildlife officers, Civil Defence Force officers and veterinary officers of Pandulagama were sent to the location along with several villagers, Mr Ranasinghe said.
At the time we reached the location, the elephant was found in a critical condition due to the injuries sustained on its front left leg, he said.
The medical team had treated the tusker on Tuesday (12) morning.
The elephant is now recovering well following the treatment. There are many licensed guns among the people living near the Kala Wewa National Park. This injury cannot be from a licensed gun, but from a trap gun used to kill wild animals illegally, he said.
Following the investigation conducted by the Wildlife officers, they found the elephant had been injured by a trap gun in the Kahagalle forest area in the Kala Wewa National Park.
It was reported that the tusker used to enter villages searching for food and it had no fear of the methods adopted by the villagers to chase him away.
Mr Ranasinghe said there was no use of creating electric fences for tuskers because tuskers use their tusks to trample the electrified fence.
Tusks do not pass electric shocks. Therefore, they remove electric fences using their tusks and enter villages to in search of food, he said. (Chaturanga Samarawickrama)

Unlocking the potential of deaf children
	
I was bullied at school for not being able to hear and learn like other students in the classroom. I used to always cry. It was hard and I felt isolated when learning with normal students, said 72-year-old Shivantha Vivekanandan. He is considered to be the most successful past pupil of the Ceylon School for the Deaf in Ratmalana. 
Vivekanandan is the President of the Past Pupils Association of the Ceylon School for the Deaf (CSD),Ratmalana. Being deaf from birth, deafness never stopped him from winning a number of awards, major trophies, medals and obtaining certificates in studies and dabbling in sports and art. 
Many deaf children grow up isolated and deprived. Reminiscing his childhood, he said he was lucky to have parents who had spent their time, effort and money to support his education and future. Thanks to his parents, he has excelled in sports and won a number of awards locally and internationally. 
The majority of hearing impaired children arent as lucky as he. Some parents may not have resources to provide for their childs needs nor be knowledgeable enough to understand their childs problem and the ways to address this issue. Due to ignorance most parents discover the hearing loss of their children far too late. When this condition is discovered late, treatment is impossible. 
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), there are 466 million individuals in the world with disabling hearing loss (6.1% of the worlds population). As many as 432 million (93%) of them are adults, 34 million (7%) are children and approximately one-third of persons over 65 years are affected by disabling hearing loss.
Only caring parents are willing to spend their time and effort for the benefit of hearing impaired children
World Health Organization (WHO) says that its likely that the number of people with disabling hearing loss would grow over the coming years. Projections show that the number could rise to 630 million by 2030 and may exceed 900 million in 2050. As with Sri Lanka there are more than 374,000 hearing impaired people. 
While hundreds of thousands of people across the country live with disabling hearing loss, the country is at risk with the number of such cases rising due to lack of access to the proper hearing care services and treatment using new technology. 


Lack of Govt. Intervention
The government, despite the proposals made in the recent budget, does not seem to be intervening in the problem, which can pose a significant threat in the future. Sri Lanka, boasting of the best health services in South Asia, has only a handful of schools for the education of deaf students. Apart from Ceylon School for the Deaf and Blind in Ratmalana there are other institutes like School of Deaf and Blind Children in Anuradhapura, St. Josephs School for the Deaf in Ragama and the Nuffield School for the Deaf and Blind in Jaffna. 

The institution teaches the pupils important skills so that they can successfully engage in a profession later on in life
Founded in 1912 the Ceylon School for the Deaf, with its objective to provide education to hearing-impaired children and to integrate them into the society, is governed by the Diocese of Colombo and managed by a Board of Trustees of which the Bishop of Colombo is the Chairperson. 
The institution teaches the pupils important skills so that they can successfully engage in a profession later on in life. Around 30 teachers are employed in the school and their salaries are paid by the Ministry of Education. However, every resident pupil of CSD is granted Rs.50 per day by the Government to meet all expenses. All other expenses in the school are borne by the funds coming from local and international donors. 
CSD Principal Samathika Jayasuriya in an interview with the Daily Mirror said that the Government needs to pay more attention to the deaf community in Sri Lanka andfacilitate them.
Among the 466 million people with disabling hearing loss in the world, 34 million are children. 60% of childhood hearing loss is due to preventable causes, she said.

With regard to the individuals inability to communicate with others, hearing loss when unaddressed has a significant adverse effect on the academic performance of children. Consequently, they often have a high rate of failing grades which underscore the huge need for assistance in education. 

Technical Aids
At CSD classes are conducted from the primary only up to Ordinary Level with the use of special technical aids like vision enhancers to assist the handicapped to read and write at the school. 
Currently, the limited vocabulary and lack of language skills hinder a deaf childs performance at the O/Level Examination. There is no special syllabus for the hearing-impaired individuals. 
In a country like Sri Lanka, children with hearing loss and deafness rarely receive any schooling. Only caring parents are willing to spend their time and effort for the benefit of hearing impaired children. Meanwhile, adults with hearing loss also have a much higher unemployment rate. As they have lower results at examinations, they dont get good job opportunities, she said. 
According to her not every child is able to obtain the benefit of hearing aids if his or her disability has made too much of a damage, ruling out medical treatment. 

Children Dump Yard
According to her, the majority of parents whose children are profoundly hearing impaired are using the Ceylon School for the Deaf as a childrendump yard. 
She said its tragic as to how those parents admit their deaf children to the school as resident pupils and never return. 
The majority of parents have provided fake addresses and phone numbers to the school management. The school management finds it out only when they try to contact those parents during a need. Due to this reason, the school is concerned about the future of the children after completing the Ordinary Level education. 
While conducting classes according to the normal school syllabus, the CSD is training its students to grab self-employment opportunities with the support of the National Vocational Training Institute, Ratmalana. 
Standard training facilities for vocations such as mushroom cultivating, carpentry and cookery are provided by CSD. 
Through regular treatment, focused education and empowerment, people with hearing loss can reach their full potential and that is what we are trying to do in our school, she said. 
The efforts of the school have been fruitful. Sameera Sandun is one of students who studied at the CSD and gathered much knowledge and training in the cookery field. 
Winning first place for his vegetable carvings at an inter-school culinary competition, Sameera set an example for the world deaf community. He is currently employed at Hilton Colombo and has won the hearts of his peers and clients. After following a six-months training at the Hilton Colombo kitchen, he started his career in 2011. 
Although it was difficult for him at first to communicate with the others and understand terms and techniques of the industry, he quietly watched the experienced chefs in action and learned everything. 
Sameera is truly an example that would motivate others to go beyond their physical restrictions and follow their dreams. Sameeras story will also change the societys perceptive of hearing impaired people, CSD Principal Jayasuriya said. 
Jayasuriya stated that people with hearing loss could benefit from early identification, use of hearing aids, cochlear implants, sign language and other forms of educational andsocial support. 
She emphasised that a child needs to be exposed to a language early for proper development. 
She stressed that raising awareness and improving access to services at the primary level of the child can help reduce the prevalence and adverse impact of hearing loss. 
Since the School for the Deaf is established and supports such deaf children to uplift their lives, these individuals no longer have resentment and anger and no longer have to hide in shame. If they dont receive the support of parents, relatives and friends because they cant speak nor hear they then believe that they live in a cage of silence and desolation, she remarked. 
She said that many causes of hearing loss can be prevented through public health measures.

Upstart shown the door
	

When a certain purohita was given a new portfolio, his private staff too shifted to his new Ministry.

Soon after assuming duties at the new Ministry, a member of the purohitas private staff called on the Ministry secretary and gave him an order: Hereafter, whenever you select Ministry or departmental employees for foreign scholarships, send the list for my approval!
The Ministry secretary, a senior member of the administrative service took exception to this order coming from a member of the purohitas private staff. I say, the Ministry secretary addressed the private staff member. You had better mind your business. Hereafter, dont step into this office to tell me how I should carry out my duties! Now you, get out!
The purohita heard about the incident that day itself. But he did not inquire about it from the Ministry secretary.
A few days later, a friend had told the Ministry secretary that he was going to get a transfer to another Ministry.
He had greeted this news with a loud chuckle and said: I dont care. Ill do the right thing wherever I have to work!
The purohita concerned is said to be a powerful politico in yahapalanaya hailing from Ruhuna.

US MCC to invest in transport, land sectors in SL
	
The US Governments Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) expects to invest in projects proposed by the Sri Lankan Government in the transport and land sectors, the US Embassy today said.

In a statement issued over the visit of US MCC Managing Director for Europe, Asia, Pacific and Latin America, Caroline Nguyen, the Embassy said MCC expects to invest in transport and land sectors based on an analysis of Sri Lankas economy and the constraints that are holding back private investment and growth.
The proposed programme seeks to reduce urban traffic congestion, improve inter-regional movement of goods and people and support government initiatives to strengthen land administration, it said.
In December 2016, MCCs Board of Directors selected Sri Lanka to develop a compact. Sri Lanka became eligible for assistance after passing 13 out of 20 indicators on MCCs policy scorecard.
Ms. Nguyen visited Sri Lanka from June 11 to 13 to advance the development of the proposed MCC compact  a large-scale five-year grant programme.
During the visit, Ms. Nguyen joined US Embassy Deputy Chief of Mission Robert Hilton at the Finance Ministry to sign an agreement to provide an additional Rs.413 million grant to finalize compact development.
This amount supplements the Rs.1.2 billion that MCC provided last July to support feasibility studies needed to develop a high-quality, evidence-based and sustainable programme, and is in addition to the final grant amount that MCC will provide for the compact, the statement said.
Ms.Nguyen said they were pleased to partner with Sri Lanka on a programme that will reduce poverty through economic growth and improve lives in the country.
This additional funding will support the final stage of compact development and help ensure that the programme will have the transformative impact that MCC and the government collectively seek,she said.
Meanwhile, Deputy Chief of Mission Robert Hilton said the MCC compact is an important part of the US governments commitment to work as partners with the people of Sri Lanka to support sustainable development.

But during the last Presidential Elections the people took a stance to say no to corruption. The People took a stand. These are challenges that we have to face
By saying there will be a revival of the LTTE, the SLPP is being disrespectful of the security forces who have done so much to this country
We have to start building bridges and start winning hearts
We are aware of our threats, shortcomings and areas that have gone wrong
People expected that those who are corrupt to be taken to task immediately. It was not only from the previous government but even from this government
Out of all political parties UNP has a very good future lineup
I think the backbenchers have to be patient
We want to take up these cases as soon
In order to pay off these debts and correct the economy we had to take tough and unpopular decisions
There is absolutely no threat to the countrys defence
If the allegations are proved the perpetrators will have to be taken to task
We are formulating our strategies and tactics

At the recently held United National Partys (UNP) Working Committee meeting it had been agreed upon that the future of the grand old party should look to the future with the recommendation proposed by the Ruwan Wijewardene Committee. Headed by Gamapaha District MP and State Minister of Defence Ruwan Wijewardene the committee has come up with certain novel, innovative and a progressive set of proposals. TheDailymirror spoke to Minister Wijewardene as to how the proposals would be implemented, challenges faced by the UNP as a party and how it is going to face a series of elections lined up for 2020.
Q There is a demand by the UNP backbenchers to implement the Ruwan Wijewardene Committee recommendations. That itself shows that its a fairly balanced and independent report. What is your response
In fact when we were making this report we took in a lot of views. In fact the committee consisted of a good number of backbenchers. The Prime Minister appointed me to head the committee. There were about 12 other backbenchers. Apart from that we spoke to the other backbenchers and senior politicians in the UNP and obtained their views and how the party should be reformed. So we took all that into consideration and made this report. So I think its a fair and balanced report which resonates what party members are demanding. Prime Minister Wickremesinghe also saw the report and observed these changes. Reforms will take place. I think making the changes is in the process. I think members would be able to see that these reforms are done pretty fast.

I think the demand is to make the reforms immediately, but this is not an easy task. It is a process and the process is now taking place.
QWhat is the response of the committee with regard to the delay in implementing the reforms
Like I said it is a process. Now the main thrust is towards constitution change within the party. These changes are needed to make it more democratic and introduce other changes into its structure. Its a long process and cant be done within one night. You cannot simply change everything. You have to see what the consequences are and I think the process has now begun. We have been speaking with the Prime Minister during the past few weeks. We have been going through the process. It is going to be implemented and I think the backbenchers have to be patient. I think they will soon see the changes that they wish to see within the party.
Q Dont you think that time is running out and within the next one and a half years you have to get ready for elections
Absolutely yes. We are keeping that in mind and we are doing the needed changes. As you said we dont have time on our hands at the moment. When the next two years are up we have to face the Presidential Elections, the General Elections and before that the Provincial elections. We have to face these elections and we have to finish off the reforms as fastest as possible. I think the Prime Minister is aware of that matter and the process is taking place.
Q During the history of the UNP it has proved itself as one of the smartest political parties in the country. Do you think the UNP is ready for the 2020 elections and meet all challenges
The Security forces present in some areas in the North have paved the way for a peaceful environment. Specially the crime rate has dropped

If you really look at all the political parties that exist, I think the UNP has an impressive line-up. Apart from the seniors we have a very good younger generation of politicians which is to come forward. If you take into account Deputy Leader Sajith Premadasa, Navin Dissanayake, Harin Fernando, Dr. Harsha de Silva, Ajith Perera and Eran Wickremeratne there is an impressive line-up. There is a good future for the party when it comes to 2020 Elections. We are formulating our strategies and tactics to help us face those challenges. In fact the Prime Minister has a political committee now and we will sit at least once or twice a week and form our strategies with the Premier and plan how to meet these challenges. With regard to the future political environment of the country, I think the UNP has a better line-up of politicians when compared to other political parties. We are aware of our threats and shortcomings. We are aware of the things that have gone wrong while being in power and the things that we have done right. So these are the things that we have been assessing and evaluating and I think we will definitely hang in there and make amends so that we would be able to face the challenges when 2020 comes.
QAs a party that is in governance, do you ever think that not taking quick and proper measures to punish those corrupt is one of the reasons that this government has become unpopular
Yes definitely. People expected those who are corrupt to be taken to task immediately. These expectations are there not only during this Government, but they were there during the past regime too. If the allegations are proved then these people will have to be taken to task. Thats the stance we have always taken. But unfortunately the investigation process including the court process and the handling of cases at the Attorney Generals Department takes a long time. This not only frustrates the public, but frustrates us politicians as well. We have fought to establish good governance and showed that we want to fight against corruption. This is one reason that we fought to get this special courts established. I think Justice Minister Thalatha Athukorala and Minister Ajith P. Perera have provided the leadership and really pushed through. We want to take up these cases as soon as possible and if certain people are proved to have engaged in corrupt deals during their times -whether they were in the former Government or this Government -they should be taken to task.
And I think that because of this process the public would have obviously thought that this Government was not taking issues seriously. Of course with other cases like the Central Bank Bond Issue coming up people thought this Government was doing the same thing as the previous Government and just fooling the public.
It is not the case. We have always stood up for good governance and that is exactly what we are driving for and hopefully with these new courts that are coming up we will be able to see quicker results.
Q Anyway as a result of what had happened and what this Government failed to do, it has paved the way for the Rajapaksas to return to power. The Rajapaksas showed their strength at the last Local Council elections. Dont you think these developments are a challenge
Definitely it is a challenge. I think former President Rajapaksa has always been a formidable politician and is loved by the people. But during the last Presidential Elections the people took a stance to say no to corruption. The People took a stand. These are challenges that we have to face. When looking back at the last Local Government Elections it was a protest vote against the Government. This result came about not because of the former Presidents policies nor the Rajapaksa family or the policies of the SLPP that they follow. I think it was definitely a protest vote by the people against the rising of cost of living, increased taxation and the issues faced by the farming community with regard to the fertiliser issue.
People showed their disapproval against the Government considering all these things. We should assess what we did wrong and remember that when this Government assumed power we took a country that was burdened with huge debts. In order to pay off these debts and correct the economy we had to take tough and unpopular decisions. And when those decisions were taken the public did not like it. But I think that we have done considerably well with regard to the economy and we are at least paying off our debts, so I think we have to really concentrate on giving what the people want and what they expect and take the country forward.
Q As specifically mentioned in your report, the party has failed to take the message to the masses and as a result you have proposed to have 50 members who are experts in social media and take various other measures to ensure the proper use of social media. Your comments
This has been the biggest problem with this Government. We have not been able to communicate what this government has done for the people. There hasnt been proper communication at all. Even with state media the Government hasnt been able to put their message forward and tell the people that this is what we have done.
This is why we suggested in our committee report that the party itself has to have a proper media committee; which is now headed by Minister Harin Fernando. He was appointed by the Prime Minister to take the partys communication effective. Fernando being a dynamic politician would do a great job in communicating our policies. I think Minister Mangala Samaraweera has shuffled some of the heads of state media. I think both he and Harin would come up with a proper media plan and execute it as soon as possible.
Q You mentioned about Minister Samaraweera who also recently fired a salvo accusing former Defence Secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa, who is expected to contest in the next Presidential Elections. Do you think Gotabaya Rajapaksha would be a challenge for the UNP
Well anyone is a challenge. I think we should not take anyone lightly. Whether its going to be Gotabaya Rajapaksa, Basil Rajapaksa or Chamal Rajapaksa its going to be one of the Rajapaksas who would be coming forward. Its a family concern there. So whoever who comes forward it would always be a challenge. We should not have a laid-back attitude and think that we are in the Government, are in power and can always win elections. It is not the case. So whoever who comes forward will have to face those challenges and be ready. I think that is part of our strategy against whoever who comes forward and that is what we are doing right now.
QAs part of the propaganda of the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP)- of which Mahinda Rajapaksa is the de-facto leader- some party leaders in it are creating a fear-psychosis in the South claiming that there is a revival of the LTTE and other armed groups in the North. How do you respond to this as the State Defence Minister
There is no way that the LTTE can be revived as a terrorist organisation. It is a banned organisation. But from the time of 2015 Presidential Elections up to now that has always been one of the slogans that the SLPP and its supporters are using in their propaganda. They have been saying that we are going to divide the country and that the LTTE will rise again and that they are already active. By creating this fear psychosis they think that they can obtain the votes of the Sinhala majority. But it is not the case.
I think by saying that they are being disrespectful of the security forces and the police who have done so much to bring peace and prosperity to this country. The security forces have continued to do a tremendous job and when they say that the LTTE is being revived in the North they are sending a message that our forces are not doing a proper job. But this is not the case. There is absolutely no threat to the countrys defence nor the security of the country. We are always monitoring the situation. There is no need for anyone to panic.
There is a political game being played in the North. From what I see there is a political tug-of-war among the Tamil political parties in the North and each one is trying to claim more Tamil nationalists than the other person or the party and that is why these kinds of rhetoric and incidents. But as far as a LTTE revival is concerned there is no way for that to happen.
Q In this backdrop how do you view the Government giving back the private lands held by the military and the Government to the original owners
That is a promise we made during the last Presidential Elections. Private land that was taken by the security forces during the conflict will be handed back to their owners. We will be doing that and we will be resettling the people. We will be giving back the lands and that is a very positive move that this Government has made specially with regard to the reconciliation process. We have to start building bridges there and we have to start winning hearts. The communities still have deep wounds caused as a result of the conflict that ended. Without making bridges and uniting the country we will never be able to heal those wounds. We are working towards a united Sri Lanka.
QDont you think that just as we won the war it is necessary that the security forces now win the hearts of the people in the north
Absolutely yes. I think they have done it. If you really look at it I know that some of the international propaganda claims that the military is still keeping the population in the North under their thumb. They are fabricating all kinds of stories. But some areas in the North having security forces has paved the way for a peaceful environment. Specially the crime rate has dropped. But now we are releasing more lands and there have been more and more positive interaction between the forces and the people. This is especially true when it comes to medical aid and during every other situation when the military has tried to help the people.
QAs the Defence Minister and the military do you have a strategy to counter allegations made by certain diaspora groups
I think we have done quite a considerable amount of negating all these negative propaganda that is surfacing. When Minister Mangala Samaraweera was the Foreign Minister he did a tremendous job meeting the diaspora and having a dialogue with them. I think that has helped sort out a lot of issues. Of course we still have extremist elements who want to create certain problems. I think that will always be there. But I think now that the international community to a large degree knows that this Government is going forward with the reconciliation process. I think the only criticism they have is that the process is not taking place at the speed they expect. But that like I said is not an easy path to take. It is a process like anything else. But I think during the last three years we have done a tremendous amount of work with regard to the reconciliation process. I think the international community has some faith in us and this Government that the right thing will be done.
QWe have one of the most experienced military with us. Do you have any plans to use this military more on international engagements like UN Peace keeping missions
We do. We have actually sent some of our battalion to Mali on Peace keeping missions. And we are hoping that we will get similar opportunities. The United Nations has looked favourably upon us and has given the green light. Depending on how we are working in Mali, we will get more opportunities to send troupes to other areas as well. That is something that we are concentrating on. Prime Minister Wickremesinghe himself did a lot to get the opportunities to send our troupes abroad. Now we are training our forces in Peace Keeping missions. The only issue is that we should get proper equipment. We are at the moment purchasing all those equipment and we would be able to send more troupes out in the future.
Q After the conclusion of the war the last regime used military personnel on various activities like cleaning and farming. We have a large military and now that the war has concluded shouldnt we use them to serve people specially in professional areas
When it comes to professionalism our forces have reached a very high degree. We can definitely use their expertise in areas like engineering and etc. But we have drawn the line to ensure that the military would not be used to clean roads and sell vegetables like the former regime did. We put a stop to that. When you come to Colombo now you can hear certain people criticizing that during the past regime Colombo was cleaner.
But can you use military to clean the roads They are a professional unit. Personally I dont think that using soldiers to clean the roads is the right thing to do and the Government took a decision to put a stop to that. These are people who fought for the country and to turn around and tell them to clean the road is somewhat demeaning. But in other areas, the professionalism showcased by our forces is very high.
Many foreign countries are interested in sending representatives to Sri Lanka and learning from our militarys experiences in how to deal with a terrorist orgnaisation and win a war. Many Asian countries and the West have shown an interest to come to Sri Lanka. We are using them and their professionalism in areas of nation building.

Wickramasinghes novels were associated with reality
	
Martin Wickramasinghe was the most popular and the best writer during the previous century.
He depicted some actual points in his novels by using characters from his village, Koggala, who were real.
The outstanding feature about his writing is his urge to stick with reality. His stories actually unfolded during the early 20th century in the southern part of Sri Lanka. They are extremely interesting and have the potential to teach a moral to the reader. Wickramasinghe possessed a wide range of knowledge on social science, history, Buddhism, philosophy, literature (bothSinhala and English) politics, arts, and even science to some extent.
When comparing him with contemporary writers, no one can take the place of Wickramasinghe in terms of his realistic philosophical style of creating novels and short stories.
Imaginary stories do not lead the reader on to the correct path. The reader becomes bored when reading imaginary stories. Such stories have the tendency to make the readers be confined to a dream world.
Further, Wickramasinghe produced artistic creations to dispel misbelief from the minds of the people. In that case Wickramasinghe wrote against the practice of witchcraft.
In the novel Leela he criticized witchcraft and explained to the reader that it was a great delusion to believe in witchcraft without opting for medical treatment.
Wickramasinghe was a genius in Sinhala literature and he laid the foundation stone to a more suitable and unwavering way of producing Sinhala literature in place of an unrealistic and imaginary way of writing.
Soviet Russia honoured his work. Novels by Wickramasinghe

have been translated into several languages . He brought great pride to his motherland.
The literary world honoured him like they honoured Tolstoy.
As Sri Lankans we must be proud of being bred in a country in which he was born.

Will not bother what Dayasiri says - CaFFE
	
While saying that it was useless to make comments on MP Dayasiri Jayasekaras statement that the list of 118 was first mentioned by the CaFFE, Keerthi Tennakoon, Executive Director of Campaign for Free and Fair Elections (CAFFE) said they would not bother what Dayasiri says.
He told Daily Mirror that people like Dayasiri always attempted to evade the issues and swept them under the carpet.
We at first raised concerns on bond scam on March 9, 2015 and disclosed the event of bond fraud at the Central Bank. Since then, we have been very vocal on the bond scam. We continued to fearlessly reveal some unexposed events on the bond scam. We are the ones who first said that there are 118 individuals including politicians, civil activists, journalists and religious leaders who have obtained funds from Arjuna Aloysius, Tennakoon said.
The amount obtained from Arjuna Aloysius exceeds day by day. Some have admitted whereas some have been accused. Anyhow, we would carry on our study on bond scam and reveal what should be revealed, Tennakoon added.
He further said he had written to the Speaker and the Presidents Secretary urging them to release the un-revealed parts of the Presidential Commission report on the bond scam. (Sheain Fernandopulle)

Yahapalanaya deserves  some credit for bond scam revelations
	

This is a rare occasion which has seen alleged complicity of the MPs are exposed by the CID
Govt deserves credit for heralding a climate of relative freedom and judicial, police independence
These shortcomings are not solely the responsibility of the government
US Justice Dept has initiated proceedings to indict Jaliya Wickremasooriya for alleged money laundering
Udayanga Weeratunga is detained in Dubai and the govt has so far failed to secure his extradition
Yahapalana government that came to power promising to combat corruption has found its parliamentarians implicated in the mother of all scams. As if the allegations of the complicity of Arjuna Mahendran, the Prime Ministers handpicked former governor of Central Bank, and the former Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake are not damaging enough, new evidence have revealed government parliamentarians have received hefty pay cheques from the disgraced bond trader Perpetual Treasures (PTL) and its subsidiaries. Sujeeva Senasinghe, the State Minister of International Trade has allegedly received Rs. 3 million during the period of 2014-2016. Twenty odd parliamentarians are reportedly being investigated by the CID over receiving funds from the PTL owner Arjun Aloysius. Many of them have their drivers and personal security officers interviewed by the CID about encashing suspicious cheques. Further incriminating evidence would surface as investigations proceed. Public would have opportunity to see a teaser in the coming weeks, when the Speaker reveals the redacted pages of the report of the Presidential Commission of Inquiry on the bond scam, which details the MPs who had engaged in telephone conversations with Arjun Aloysius. While the inclusion in this list may not necessarily imply an improper relationship, it may prompt some members to clear their names, and would effectively expose those who had benefited from hush money. 
Now, when judges recuse themselves in droves from hearing court cases against Gotabhaya Rajapaksa, one may still feel the trauma of that ominous past and the uncertainty over its probable return hanging over the state
Recent revelations have their toll on the government. Its election promises of arresting the crooks of the former regime are yet to be fulfilled. Now, with its members are braving the allegations of complicity in the bond scam, the Yahapalayana has come the full circle. But, paradoxically though, it deserves some credit for heralding a climate of relative freedom and judicial and police independence, even at its peril, that had made it possible for these incriminating details to come out, and be debated freely. This is not the first time that someone robbed the public coffers in this country. But this is a rare occasion which has seen alleged complicity of the government members are being freely exposed by the CID. 
This was not possible under the former regime, which even impeached the former Chief Justice, the one who allowed without needing a referendum, the enactment of the 18th Amendment  which almost created a dynastic presidency - after she double crossed Basil Rajapaksa on the Divineguma Bill.
The officials of the Attorney General Department who now come up with new revelations at every court hearing would rather have been more restrained had it been the former regime. Perhaps, activist officials would have been warming desks, while the henchmen handpicked by the Presidents House conduct investigations to a predetermined conclusion. That was how things happened in the past. Now, when judges recuse themselves in droves from hearing court cases against Gotabhaya Rajapaksa, one may still feel the trauma of that ominous past and the uncertainty over its probable return hanging over the state. 
The govt MPs who earlier fervently defended the PTL and its ownership, would now ask why only they are being investigated. Why not the crooks of the former regime
Why this government is at the receiving end is not primarily due to corruption, but due to its complacency. Corruption at present is neither underwritten by those at the helm of the state, nor is swept under the carpet as it had been in the past. However, this government is not a proactive government. It is reactive and is bordering incompetence. This complacency is why it could not indict a single big fish of the former regime who have been accused of corruption. Rajapaksas nephews Udayanga Weeratunga and JaliyaWickremasooriya, the former ambassadors to Russia and the United States are absconding justice for four years. The latter is more likely to face criminal procedure in America than here. The US Justice Department has initiated proceedings to indict Jaliya Wickremasooriya for alleged money laundering. Udayanga Weeratunga is detained in Dubai and the government has so far failed to secure his extradition. Also, Gotabaya could well manage to evade the arrest with the help of a spree of restraining orders against anticipatory arrest, until the next presidential election. 
Public would have opportunity to see a teaser in the coming weeks, when the Speaker reveals the redacted pages of the report of the PCoI on the bond scam, which details the MPs who had conversations with Arjun Aloysius
These shortcomings are not solely the responsibility of the government. They are products of the imperfections of the state and its institutions. Why a country needs a government, is among others, to put these things in order. If Sri Lanka is to address these shortcomings, it needs a government that is not just proactive, but also does not shy away from exercising its authority to expedite things. 
In this deepening sense of inertia, the government may try to avoid the loss of its face by covering up the wrongdoings of its own members. The government Parliamentarians, who earlier fervently defended the PTL and its ownership, would now ask why only they are being investigated. Why not the crooks of the former regime The failure of the UNP leadership to make a statement on the recent revelations is proof of this dilemma.
