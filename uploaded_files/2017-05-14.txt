Modi?s speech a boost to new separatism: NUTA
	
Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi?s statement addressing the estate Tamil Indian factions at the Norwood area was a fillip to separatism, the National University Teachers Association (NUTA) said today.
Issuing a statement NUTA General Secretary Dr. Channa Jayasumana said the core of PM Modi?s statement based only for the upcountry Tamil factions and not focused on other Tamil communities in the country.
?PM Modi said the Indian Tamils are maintaining the Indian culture. His influence to do so is discouraging those people to assimilate into the Sri Lankan culture. We also condemn that he addressed these people as part of the Indian Diaspora,? he said.
?Sinhalese, Tamils and Muslims in the country suffered due to the terrorism that was created and backed by Indian politics and secret services. Therefore it is our responsibility not to repeat the past mistakes in future,? he said.
?PM Modi had treated plantation sector Indian Tamils as a faction within an Indian State without considering them as people, who lives in a neighbouring foreign country. It could lead to different mentality in those people. Those people do not belong to India or any other country as they are Sri Lankans,? Dr. Jayasumana said. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

Govt. should expose forces behind SLMC grenade: GMOA
	
The Government Medical Officers? Association (GMOA) today condemned the attack on Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) and said the Government should immediately investigate the matter before another insurgency broke out in the country.
Speaking to the Daily Mirror, GMOA Secretary Dr. Samantha Ananda said the recent attack showed the shameful attempt to silence the SLMC by preventing doing its duty to ensure the quality and the standard of the country?s medical education.
He said the SLMC and its officials were attacked on many occasions however, the lawsuits failed to do justice by arresting responsible individuals.
?This is not the first time the SLMC was attacked. The SLMC office was set fire in 2002 and many SLMC officials and their residencies were attacked on several occasions. The law was not enforced and justice was not served. Therefore the Government should at least find those responsible for the recent attack,? he said.
Meanwhile, Senior DIG Nandana Munasinghe, who is in charge in the investigation said no breakthrough had been made in the investigation.
However, he said the Colombo Crimes Division and the Forensic Units were collecting evidence to find the motive behind the attack and to trace the suspects. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)
