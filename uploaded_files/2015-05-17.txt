	After spending 41 days in Sri Lankan jail, 37 Indian fishermen belonging to Nagapattinam arrived at the Indian Coast Guard station in Karaikal on Saturday to an emotional reception by family members, friends and officials.
	The fishermen were detained by the Sri Lankan Navy on April 4 for allegedly fishing in the waters of the island nation and were subsequently remanded in judicial custody. A court in Sri Lanka had issued order to release them on Friday.

Promoting Maj.Gen.Dias, a blow to justice-HRW
	
		 		 
		 
			
Human Rights Watch (HRW) said today that promotion of a senior officer as the Chief of Staff of the Sri Lanka Army, whose division was implicated in serious human rights abuses, casts doubt on government pledges to credibly investigate alleged war crimes.
Maj. Gen. Jagath Dias, who led the Army?s 57th Division during the last two years of the civil war with the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), was appointed army chief of staff, one of the armed forces? highest post. Although effective May 7, 2015, the appointment was only made public on May 15.
?Sri Lanka?s new government has promised genuine accountability for wartime abuses, but naming the general of an abusive unit the army chief of staff is a slap in the face for victims,? said Brad Adams, Asia director.
?Members of the UN Human Rights Council expecting genuine accountability in Sri Lanka need to closely scrutinize the government?s actions.?
?The 57th Division took part in the last battles of the war, including the extremely bloody and abusive fighting on a small stretch of beach in Mullaitivu district. Human Rights Watch documented the indiscriminate shelling of civilians and hospitals by government forces in the region where the 57th Division was deployed,? it said.
The previous government of President Mahinda Rajapaksa denied any laws-of-war violations by the military and placed all blame for civilian losses on the LTTE. He rewarded top commanders for their role in the war. Maj. Gen. Dias served as the deputy head of Sri Lanka?s mission to Germany from 2009 to 2011. In 2013, Gen. Dias was denied entry visas to Australia and the United States for his possible involvement in war crimes.
In light of the Sri Lankan government?s resistance to accountability, the UN Human Rights Council in March 2014 adopted a resolution calling on the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights to open an independent international investigation into allegations of abuses by both sides. The Rajapaksa government refused to cooperate with the investigation.
The present government of President Maithripala Sirisena, elected in January 2015, has stated publicly that it intends to reverse Rajapaksa?s policies and deliver justice and accountability for war crimes. While positive steps have been taken to end the Rajapaksa government?s repressive governance style, the new administration has yet to make meaningful moves toward addressing wartime abuses.
The government should put into place an effective accountability mechanism with a significant international component. Previous government accountability mechanisms have been impaired by harassment, threats, and violence against witnesses and commissioners. The best way to address this problem would be to create a combined international and domestic court similar to the successful hybrid courts in Sierra Leone and Bosnia-Herzegovina.
?The government?s appointment of General Dias is further proof that Sri Lanka needs an independent justice process with a strong international component that can undertake impartial investigations and prosecutions,? Adams said. ?Six years since the end of the brutal conflict, the victims of the war still await justice.?

Ranil?s statement bad by law
	
The Leader of the Opposition has said that Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe's statement regarding the Supreme Court judgment in the Fundamental Rights petition filed by former Defence Secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa was a severe blow on the independence of the judiciary, rule of law and good governance.
In a press release issued today he pointed out the Prime Minister?s statement was baseless and bad by law.
?The United National Party and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe have demonstrated their attempt to uphold their principles and policies influenced by foreign elements. His statement regarding the Supreme Court judgment was a violation of the county?s sovereignty.
?In the past the Privy Council in England had the power to revise or quash the judgments of the Sri Lanka?s Supreme Court, but it was abolished by the Republican Constitution. Today the Supreme Court is the highest body of the judiciary and its judgments are final.?
?I would like to point out to the people that Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe?s statement that Sri Lanka will have to depend to the decisions of the Commonwealth Judges is an attempt to undermine the Sri Lankan Courts and an undue challenge against the Supreme Court.? I stress that Prime Minister as a responsible personality should withdraw his statement and refrain from making such ridiculous statements. He should set an example to the people and respect the judiciary.
?The Prime Minister and the Government should uphold good governance and the Rule of Law and also revoke the gazette notification relating to? the Financial Crime Investigation Unit, which was aimed at victimising political opponents,? the press release said.
