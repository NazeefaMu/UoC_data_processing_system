ComBank introduces ?e? passbook on mobile phone
	
The Commercial Bank of Ceylon has broken new ground in technology-enabled convenience by becoming the first bank in Sri Lanka to offer customers an e-Passbook that provides access to details of savings, current, NRFC and RFC accounts on Android and iOS powered mobile devices.
A breakthrough digital virtual mobile application offered free by the country?s largest private bank enables account holders to have a real-time view of transactions of the past 30 days on their mobile phones or tabs anytime, anywhere.
The app, which updates automatically whenever the user is online, also stores the last view of the e-Passbook on the user?s mobile device, making it possible to view it even when the phone or tab is offline, the Bank said.
??This is one of the most exciting new developments in our technology offering,? Commercial Bank Managing Director/CEO Jegan Durairatnam said. ?Our team is constantly looking to push the boundaries of what is possible in our search to offer the ultimate in convenience to customers. This app is a great example of the Bank?s capabilities in, and commitment to, technology-enabled banking.? He added that once the e-passbook is downloaded and the access code is set, checking an account is as easy as tapping on the phone screen.
The e-Passbook is able to display account history as in a standard savings passbook or a current account statement. It offers users real-time tracking of account transactions of the last 30 days, and can be used as a single repository for multiple accounts enrolled by an account holder for the facility, with the capability to view each account separately.
Users may label different accounts with preferred names or codes for easy reference. The e-Passbook app offers the user the flexibility of operating with or without a log-in password.?
Any existing personal savings, NRFC, RFC or current account holder of Commercial Bank who has a valid mobile number registered with the Bank may activate the e-Passbook facility by calling a branch, by calling the e Banking Call Centre on 011 2353576 or by visiting a branch, the Bank said. New customers who open personal savings, current, NRFC or RFC accounts can also request the facility which will be provided at the time of opening the account.
Joint Account holders too could obtain the e-Passbook facility after submitting the written consent of all parties, the Bank said.
Besides the new e-Passbook facility, Commercial Bank also offers mobile phone users the convenience of accessing many of its services via the Bank?s own sophisticated app for users of Apple or Android-powered smart devices.
Offering both on and off line functionality, the App which can be downloaded free of charge, enables users to conduct a wide range of transactions and view key information on their mobile phones 24 hours of the day.
Among the online features are a dashboard view for account inquiry and bank notifications sent via secure messages, credit card balance inquiry, bill settlement, current cycle of transactions and online payment history, inquiries on investments and loans, payments and online payment history, ?transfer of funds between own and registered accounts with online transfer history, and password changes.
The offline menu of the Mobile Banking App provides locations of Commercial Bank branches and ATMs, exchange and interest rates, general notices, a ?Help? feature and the ?Contact us? option.?
The only Sri Lankan bank to be ranked among the Top 1000 banks of the world for five consecutive years, Commercial Bank operates a network of 250 branches and 625 ATMs in Sri Lanka, the largest electronic cash dispensing facility owned by a single bank in the country. The Bank was ranked the most valuable private sector brand in Sri Lanka in 2014 and has also won multiple awards as Sri Lanka?s best bank from a number of international publications over several years. The Bank was adjudged one of Sri Lanka?s 10 best corporate citizens by the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce in 2013 and 2014.
Commercial Bank?s overseas operations encompass Bangladesh, where the Bank operates 18 branches and Myanmar, where it has a Representative Office in Yangon. In September 2015, the Bank received regulatory approval for the establishment of a fully-fledged Tier I Bank in the Republic of Maldives. The Bank also received license to operate a fully owned Money Transfer Operation in Italy recently.

Accordingly, UNIDO has allocated a revolving fund of USD 600,000 to assist the industry through HNB?s internationally renowned Gami Pubuduwa micro finance scheme. The other stakeholders of this project are the Ministry of Industry and Commerce and the Sri Lanka Bamboo Association.?
This project is aimed at developing a new industrial bamboo sector in Sri Lanka by establishing a bamboo supply chain and processing industry.

## Title: If you can?t run the country, give it to me: MR

If you can?t run the country, give it to me: MR
	
Addressing a large crowd that had gathered at the ?Jana Satana? rally organised by the joint opposition against the UNP - led government in Colombo today, former president, Mahinda Rajapaksa said he would show them how the country should be run if it were handed over to him -- as the government was doing an abysmal job of it.
?If you can?t run the country, give it to me. I will show you how to run it,? said Mr. Rajapaksa, at the rally held at Hyde Park -- which was attended by 46 MPs of the joint opposition, including Chamal Rajapaksa and four SLFP vice presidents.
The former president said the government was taking revenge on its political opponents and accusing the previous government of causing an economic crisis and various other problems in the country, in an attempt to cover up the its ineptitude.
He said he, too, could have pulled skeletons out of closets but had decided to develop the country instead. ?If I had searched closets, I would have found skeletons too. But I decided not to do so when I took over the country,? he said.
Mr. Rajapaksa said he had built expressways, ports, power plants and airports with the loans he had obtained during his tenure. He said the government had not even built a culvert after obtaining US$ 6,361 million worth of loans last year.
He said the government accused him of obtaining loans without declaring them and also said that that was why the government had to increase taxes. ?The government should have refused to repay the loans if they were obtained in a secret manner. Then there would have been no problem,? he said.
He pledged to remain in politics even if he and his entire family were put behind bars. ?I will engage in politics for the sake of the people of this country even if my entire family is put in jail,? he said.
MP Mahindananda Aluthgamage said the government led by the UNP was leading the country towards anarchy and an economic crisis and that the joint opposition would send it home. ?Jana Satana is the first move towards achieving that goal,? he said.
MP Kumara Welgama faulted SLFP Minister S. B. Dissanayake for leaving the party more than once and for threatening disciplinary action against SLFP MPs who attended the rally. ?Mahinda Rajapaksa never left the party -- unlike Chandrika Kumaratunga and S.B. Dissanayake. S.B. Dissanayake has lost direction and knows nothing about what he speaks of,? he said.
NFF Leader Wimal Weerawansa said Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe had increased taxes and put people into difficulties but had increased the privileges of ministers. ?Bitter medicine for the general public and sweet medicine for the ministers from Dr. Wickremesinghe,? he said.
He said the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) which had criticised the excessive number of ministers in the previous government, had sold itself to the UNP. He critisised JVP leader Anura Kumara Disssanayake for remaining silent on the appointment of ministers.
MP Udaya Gammanpila said the joint opposition was ready to take over the reins. ?The government is ruining the country. We can?t wait any longer. We are ready to take over,? he said.
Janatha Sevaka Party leader Somawansa Amarasinghe said he would pledge support to any people's movement which opposed the UNP and imperialism.
?If there are real anti-UNPers, this is the place for them. Prime Minister Wickremesinghe should stop his traitorous actions. We wish to remind him that he was sent home after two years in power, in 2004; and that we can still do it,? he said.
Joint opposition leader Dinesh Gunawardane, Vasudeva Nanayakkara, Bandula Gunawardane, Rohitha Abeygunawardana, Gamini Lokuge Professor Tissa Vitharana, former chief justice Sarath N. Silva, trade union activist W.H. Piyadasa and songstress Neela Wickramasinghe also spoke at the rally. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

Jt. Opp calls on 'victims' of UNP to join today's rally
	
Parliamentarians attached to the Sri Lanka Freedom Party's joint opposition yesterday said that they hoped the party wouldn?t take disciplinary action against them for taking part in the rally which would be held today (17) in Colombo as it would be held against the United National Party (UNP).
The rally organised by the joint opposition would be held at the Hyde Park Grounds, in Colombo this afternoon with the participation of ex-President Mahinda Rajapaksa against the Government led by the UNP.
Addressing a news conference, MP Mahindananda Aluthgamage said it was the nature and the responsibility of the pro-left SLFP to go against a pro-right party like the UNP. ?We are against the policies of the UNP. The government is headed by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe who is the UNP Leader. He does whatever he wants and takes arbitrary actions without considering the opinion of others. That?s why we are against a government led by him. The first of a series of actions aimed at sending this government home will commence with the rally at Hyde Park,? he said.
Earlier, Social Empowerment and Welfare Minister S. B. Dissanayake warned that the SLFP MPs who participate in today's rally would face possible disciplinary action by the party.
Responding to the minister?s remarks, MP Aluthgamage asked whether it was fair to take disciplinary action by the SLFP on its MPs for going against the UNP which is considered the common enemy of the SLFP. ?Sending the UNP-led government home would only favour the SLFP. We don?t think the party will take disciplinary action against us. After all, we don?t see anything wrong with paving the way for the SLFP to form its own government,? he said.
He said they had not being informed so far in writing about any disciplinary action that would be taken and said even if they did receive letters, their argument would remain unchanged.
The MP said Ex-President Rajapaksa would definitely address the rally today while Janatha Sevaka Party Leader Somawansa Amarasinghe and representatives of more than 50 political parties would also participate in the rally.
Meanwhile, MP Rohitha Abeygunawardena said there were attempts by the government to sabotage the rally. ?No obstacle can stop us. We invite the victims of this government to join us. We invite people whose concessions have been curtailed and those who have been burdened by the heavy taxes of this government to take part in this rally,? he said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

JVP wants LG polls under old system
	
The Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) said today the Local Government Election should be announced before March 31 and that the election should be held under the previous electoral system without delay.
JVP leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake said it was illegal to postpone the Local Government Election as per the Local Government Act; the term of Local Government Bodies could be extended only by a year.
?The local government election cannot be postponed more than a year. Previously it was done according to the Emergency Law but now it was not so. If the government cannot hold the election under the new system, it should be held under the old system and the new system should be included in the new constitution so that all the election could be held under the new system. There should not be a new system only for the Local Government Election,? he said.
Mr. Dissanayake alleged that the government was trying to postpone the election on political grounds as President Maithripala Sirisena did not want to see the SLFP divided before the election and the UNP thinks that the present situation was not congenial for an election to be held.
?The only matter the government raises for having postponed the election is the shortcomings of the delimitation process. We accept that as it was done by the previous government not on reasonable grounds but to establish its power of the Local Government Bodies,? he said.
Mr. Dissanayake told a news conference that his party was considering taking legal action against the postponement of the elections and that they would also request for a two-day debate on the matter next week.
?The Local Government Bodies are closely connected to the issues of the ordinary people such as disposing garbage, constructing village level roads and installing street lamps. But the whole system is disrupted as the administrations of the Local Government Bodies were handed over to the officers. They are not governed by the people now,? he said. (Ajith Siriwardana)

The Chinese funded Colombo Port City Project would not be carried out according to the original plan signed during the previous regime, but with certain amendments to make it environmentally viable, Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake said today.
? We promised that the project would not be carried out according to the original plan and we had not gone back on our word,? the Minister said.
The Minister told a media briefing that the environmental approval had been obtained for the project.
He denied that the environment approval had only been given to reclaim the land from the sea and not for construction work ?The media may have go to know something which we are not aware of ,? the Minister said responding to a question raised by the journalists.
?The approval had been given both for the filling of the sea and for the construction,? the Mr Karunanayake said.
The US $ 1.4 billion urban development project will cover 233 hectares of reclaimed land adjoining the Port of Colombo. The deal was initially signed between the Sri Lankan government and the China Communications Construction Ltd in November 2013 but it was suspended when the new government came into power in 2015 . However Cabinet nod was given to restart the work of the project last week.

Release person imprisoned over my suicide attack: SF
	
Regional Development Minister Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka today requested President Maithripala Sirisena to take necessary legal steps to release the person who is imprisoned in connection with the suicide bomb attack on him at the Sri Lanka Army Headquarters in 2006.
Addressing a media briefing in Colombo, he said the President had set a noble example by pardoning the person who had attempted to assassinate him in a suicide attack in Colombo in 2008.
Similarly, Minister Fonseka said he too wanted to pardon the person convicted of attempting to assassinate him in 2006.
?The person who tried to kill me in the suicide bomb attack is still in prison. He talked to me when I served my jail term. He sat with me on the same bench in the prison and told me how he hatched the plan to eliminate me. He also told me how he falsified facts during Police interrogations,? he added.
He said there was a massive embezzlement of money while constructing the Southern Expressway during the former regime. He said the highway was planned to be built with three lanes on each side but it was limited to two under the guidance of that government.
?The southern express way may be the one and only highway in the world which consists of a huge iron bar in the middle of the road to separate the two lanes,? he added.
He said the former government had made a contradictory opinion about the war-victory. He also said there isn?t any ruler in the world who published posters, cutouts, banners, booklets etc. to display that he had ended the war.
He said the former regime had taken large scale loans for various projects including $ 500 million for the harbor, $ 300 million for the Mattala Rajapaksa International Airport (MRIA).
He also said there were grave irregularities in the purchase of MIG aircraft at that time.
?The former regime?s MIG deal took place in three stages. Two of these steps were to pay money. It was done through former defence secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa. The amount was US $ 100 million involving an inactivated company in England,? he said. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)
