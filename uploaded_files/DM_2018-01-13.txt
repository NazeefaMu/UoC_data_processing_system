He never turned away the many who asked for help
	
Sri Lanka lost a wonderful personality whose life was dedicated to helping and supporting as many as he could cutting across religious, racial, ethnic and cultural diversities. He left us on January 6, 2018 at the Mount Elizabeth Hospital in Singapore. He was committed to selfless service to others not with the hope of feeling good, fame or glory but driven by an unquenchable thirst and passion to serve humanity. A vast number of people gathered at the Kanatte crematorium on January 8, 2018 to pay their last respects and it was only on this occasion that the Eassuwaren family learned what he had done for so many when they opened up their grieved hearts to speak of the magnanimity and spirituality of thelate Eassuwaren.
He was the eldest in a family of nine and completed his schooling career at St. Benedicts College in Kotahena and earned his Bachelor of Commerce degree at Pachaiyappa College, Chennai, University of Madras. Thereafter he joined his father Deshabandu, Visva Prasadini V.T.V Deivanayagam in their family business of import and wholesale distribution of commodities in Pettah. In 1964, he established Eswaran Brothers as a family partnership to venture into international trade. Eswaran Brothers Exports Pvt Ltd is the third largest tea bag manufacturer in Sri Lanka. Mr. Eassuwaran was the Chairman of Eswaran Brothers Exports, T-Print Ltd and Mayfair Lanka Ltd.
He was a much-respected businessman who was a personification of humility and integrity. He was the President of National Chamber of Commerce, Sri Lanka in 2009/2010. He was the Honorary Consul for the Republic of Mauritius in Sri Lanka from 1995 to 2012. He was also the Vice President of both Sri Lanka-India Community Council and of the People of Indian Origin (PIO). Mr. Eassuwaran was also a Council Member of the Uva Wellasa University in Badulla and a former President of the Duty-Free Association.
He was the Chairman of the Finance Committee in the construction of the 67.5 feet high Rambadagalle Samadhi Buddha statue in the precincts of Vidyasagara Pirivena Viharaya in Monaragala. This project was his dream and initiation. He brought down expert sculptors from India to complete this gigantic task. The Rambadagalle Samadhi Buddha statue was opened by President Maithripala Sirisena on April 30, 2015. There were several more Societies and Trusts that were set up and guided by him to support various religions and communities. In the Village of Vallanadu, India, the family has sponsored a school where 800 students are studying up to Pre-University level.
He was awarded the title of Deshabandu by the Government of Sri Lanka in 2017 for his services to the nation.
I have personally known Eassuwaran for more than 40 years and he has been a very genuine and sincere friend to me and sometimes plays the role of an elder brother. His humility and smile from the heart is contagious. His patience and tolerance for human failure is unimaginably relaxing. I am so fortunate to have been one of those who had the opportunity to meet such a man and be
his friend.
His wife and four children became very close friends of my family. His wife Thilaka dedicated her whole life in taking care and supporting her husband all the way. In fact, she derived her dignity in following in the steps of her beloved husband. Both Eassuwaran and Thilaka set fine examples to humanity. It is little wonder then that their two sons Ganesh and Subramaniam and two daughters Lalli and Priya have turned out to be such nice persons respecting the environment and rejoicing diversity.
Sages have said that leaders are measured either by the values or legends they leave behind. He accomplished both. In his lifetime of 75 years, he has done so much to communities that cannot be easily matched. I will surely miss him significantly for the rest of my life.
May he attain the supreme bliss of Nirvana.

Lasantha Wickrematunga Assassins Must Be Prosecuted Without Delay
	

The Rajapaksa govt resorted to several unorthodox measures in prosecutingthe war.
The officials are in a quandary because they do not know what decision would be taken by the political executive. The ambivalent attitude of this divided at the top Govt is such that one does not know whether amber would turn to green or red!

There is disappointment on almost every front and the reasons are known to all. Disillusionment has set in


ByD.B.S. Jeyaraj

Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa in his misguided astrological and numerological wisdom held the seventh presidential elections on January 8th 2015. When the date was announced most people yearning for a regime change in Sri Lanka noted the symbolic significance of January 8th in a different context. It was on January 8th 2009 that Lasantha Manilal Wickrematunge , the well known editor of The Sunday Leader was brutally assassinated in broad daylight while on his way to work.
Many of Lasanthas family,friends,colleagues and readers had been consistently demanding that justice be done for the murdered editor but to no avail. It was an open secret then that the hands of Rajapaksa regime were stained with the blood of Lasantha Wickrematunge. So when the presidential poll was fixed for Jan 8th 2015 there was an optimistic feeling in these circles that the Rajapaksa regime would be overthrown on the date of Lasanthas death. If that happened it would have been truly an instance of poetic justice,it was felt then.
The unexpected happened and on Jan 8th 2015 Maithripala Sirisena obtaining votes cutting across race,religion, class and regional differences was elected president. There was buoyant optmism in Sri Lanka as Sirisena became president and Ranil Wickremesinghe Prime Minister. A good governance Govt was set up. A 100 day program was drawn up. The country basked in the glow of a gloriously radiant dawn. Alas!that dawn has proved to be a false dawn!

Anniversary of Lasantha Wickrematunge is also observed and mourned by those near and dear to the slain editor. An inevitable question arises on Jan 8th. Have the murderers of Lasantha Wickrematunge been charged in courts

There is disappointment on almost every front and the reasons are known to all. Disillusionment has set in. An important yardstick to measure the performance of the Sirisena-Wickremesinghe Govt is provided on Jan 8th. Even as the anniversary of President Sirisenas electoral victory is celebrated on Jan 8th , the death anniversary of Lasantha Wickrematunge is also observed and mourned by those near and dear to the slain editor. An inevitable question arises on Jan 8th. Have the murderers of Lasantha Wickrematunge been charged in courts The answer sadly is NO!
Nine years has passed since Lasanthas death and three years have passed since Sirisena was elected president but no one has been charged in courts so far for Lasantha Wickrematunges murder. There have been many twists and turns in the process of investigations and some of those have been published in sections of the media. Sri Lankas politcal grapevine has been buzzing overtime with developments concerning Lasanthas murder. Govt bigwigs talk positively of breakthroughs in probes and of potential indictments from time to time but the ground reality has been a NATO (no action talk only) so far.

Men In Black On Motorcycles
Lasantha Wickramatunge was murdered on January 8th 2009. On that fateful morning, a domestic aide had detected signs of potential danger. Some unknown men dressed in black on motor cycles were hovering around in the vicinity of Lasanthas residence. The domestic aide warned Lasantha. When Sonali Samarasinghe, his wife heard about the hovering motorcyclists she pleaded with Lasantha not to go out of the house at that time. But Lasantha refused to do so and started out in his car to office asking Sonali to come later in her car.
The motorcyclists had followed the vehicle and Lasantha had telephoned an influentialperson on his mobile phone and told him of the suspicious activity of the motor cyclemen. Lasanthas car was on Attidiya rd near the Bakery Handiya junction when the stalking assassins got into action. They converged around like predators encircling prey when the vehicle was close to the Malagalage Junior School.

Lasantha Wickrematunges murder was not the only act of injustice that was perpetrated during the presidency of Mahinda Rajapaksa. Lasantha paid the supreme price but he was not the only victim from the fourth estate fraternity.

According to some eye-witness accounts there were four motor cycles in all. Two had cut across in front of the car blocking Lasantha and forcing him to brake suddenly. Two other motor cycles moved up on either side of the car.The assassins in black wore helmets. Like the four horsemen of the apocalypse, these messengers of death closed in on Lasantha. The windscreen was smashed. The assassins then yanked the door open. Pulling out their instruments of death the black souls launched their cowardly attack against the unarmed journalist whose only weapon was his pen writing the bold truth.
The assassins then mounted their bikes and sped away. There was a sentry point manned by the Air Force about 100 metres away. Several onlookers saw the terrifying assault. But the assassins simply vanished.The unconscious Lasantha was bleeding profusely. He was first taken to the nearest Kalubowila hospital. An ambulance was prepared to take him from Kalubowila to the National hospital.
The doctors found his condition too critical to move him . So emergency surgery was done at Kalubowila with a team of doctors rushing to Kalubowila from Borella. The medical personnel strove hard for hours to resuscitate him. After four hours of battling for life Lasantha passed away.Thus ended the saga of one of the bravest human beings I have ever known. Thus ended the life of a fearless scribe, crusading for justice and peace. An irredeemable loss for journalism and Sri Lanka.

A Huge Personal Loss
Lasanthas death has been a huge, personal loss to me.He and I were colleagues on The Island in the eighties of the last century. We were also residents of Kotahena then. Later on after I moved to Canada I was for many years a columnist writing from Toronto at The Sunday Leader which he edited.But Lassie Boy as I called him was a friend in every sense of the word. How I miss him!
Lasantha Wickrematunges murder was not the only act of injustice that was perpetrated during the presidency of Mahinda Rajapaksa. Lasantha paid the supreme price but he was not the only victim from the fourth estate fraternity. Prageeth Eknaligoda was made to disappear;Poddala Jayantha was white-vanned and assaulted .Keith Noyahr was abducted and tortured.Upali Tennekoon and his wife were attacked. The plight of Tamil media personnel has been terrible. Several journalists have been reportedly killed in the past.

The unfettered investigations conducted by the Police Criminal Investigation Department(CID) after the current govt assumed ofice has resulted in a breakthrough in the probe into Lasanthas killing

Although a large number of journalists have been killed, made to disappear, assaulted and tortured in the past, the murder of Lasantha Wickrematunge has received the greatest attention on a national and international scale. The main reason for this is that Lasantha Wickrematunge was the most high - profile journalist or Editor to be killed. He was a fearless editor who spoke truth to power and by doing so irked the powers that be.The brutal cold -blooded mode of his murder and the means adopted by the Rajapaksa regime to stifle and obstruct investigations indicated very clearly that Lasantha could not have been murdered without the sanction of those in power at that time. Hence the assassination of Lasantha Wickramatunge is regarded as an emblematic case symbolising the state of impunity in Sri Lanka. If there is justice for Lasantha then there could be justice for all. If there is no justice for Lasantha then there cant be justice for the others too.
Therefore the tardy progress made by this Govt in prosecuting those allegedly responsible for killing Lasantha Wickrematuge has been most disappointing and disheartening. The lack of an indictment in courts so far has in a way been an indictment on the Sirisena- Wickremesinghe regime in the court of public opinion. Lasanthas elder brother and Sri Lankas Consul-General in Sydney , Lalraj Wickrematunge gave voice to this feeling of frustration in his message on the 9th death anniversary.Wickrematunge known as Lal to all stated in his message -

Justice Has Not Been Done
Nine years has passed since Lasantha was done to death in the most dastardly fashion. Nine years has passed and justice has not been done. Murder, not restricted to Lasantha but of other journalists, was carried out with impunity at a time when apathy reigned amongst the people
At present there is a sense of hopelessness at the manner the present administration is handling investigations. Should political authorities be guiding murder investigations, one may ask. Some may argue that it is the duty to do so since the very same murders have been used to garner votes at election time. Presently, the murders are used to remind people of how brutal a regime was when they occurred. But what about bringing the perpetrators to book
Many such investigations are all but concluded. The need is to arrest the suspects and charge them for murder. Letting time pass by till it is convenient may turn out to be counterproductive, as history has evidenced
The last regime was defeated on the backs of those committed journalists who laid down their lives when even those in Parliament were quivering before a marauding group in control of every sphere of human activity in our land. Justice needs be done not as a favour. Justice needs be done to prevent a repetition. Else, they would have died not for the people but for a chosen few to replace the defeated
Murder, when it is committed by criminals outside of politics, is investigated in haste and convictions obtained in a couple of years.Failure to bring to justice those responsible for the murder of Lasantha could even open the door to the prime suspect or suspects to be elected the President or Prime Minister of our land at a future date. Who knows
Lal Wickrematunges message contains two saient points of crucial importance. Firstly he says that many of the investigations into murders are all but concluded. The need is to arrest the suspects and charge them for murderobserves Lal. Secondly Wickrematunge says At present there is a sense of hopelessness at the manner the present administration is handling investigations and goes on to ask  Should political authorities be guiding murder investigations

The Elephant In The Room
If one were to take Lal Wickrematunges many layered statement at face value and also read between the lines, one inescapable conclusion could be arrived at about Lasanthas killing. The investigation into Lasantha Wickrematuges murder and those responsible - both the minions and their masters - have been identified. The elephant in the room is the absence of political will at the highest levels of Govt to go ahead with an appropriate legal course of action.
This writer being a closely associated with Lasantha Wickrematunge in both a professional and personal capacity for many years has been following the process of investigations into the slain editors murder since his demise. The situation in the Rajapaksa era was that of constricting,diverting or obstructing the investigation. The motions were seemingly followed but there was no intention from inception to conduct a genuine probe. There were many red herrings.

Files have been sent to the Attorney - Generals Department it is learnt. It appears from all accounts that there is enough evidence for a Prima Facie case in the murder of Lasantha Wickrematunge

The situation under the Sirisena-Wickremesinghe Government is somewhat different. There has been a genuine investigation, despite fits and starts , into Lasanthas murder. The investigating sleuths seem to have garnered necessary evidence and identified the perpetrators but the obstacle appears to be foot dragging by those in the upper echelons of political power.Under the Rajapaksa regime it was a case of red light for the probe. Under this govt the green light was given for a free and fair investigation. Much of that probe is now over. However the law enforcement authorities are unable to proceed further to indict and prosecute because the amber light is flashing.The officials are in a quandary because they do not know what decision would be taken by the political executive. The ambivalent attitude of this divided at the top Govt is such that one does not know whether amber would turn to green or red!

Failure to bring to justice those responsible for the murder of Lasantha could even open the door to the prime suspect or suspects to be elected the President or Prime Minister of our land at a future date. Who knows
From what has been reported in the media so far and from what I have been able to gather through my own sources the current situation and background in brief seems to be this. The war against the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam(LTTE)was pursued with renewed vigour after Mahinda Rajapaksa was elected president in November 2005. Mahinda appointed his brother Gotabhaya as Defence secretary. Acting upon the advice of his brother the defence secretary,President Rajapaksa appointed Sarath Fonseka as Army commander. The triumvirate comprising President Mahinda Rajapaksa, Defence Secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa and Army Chief Sarath Fonseka was hailed for providing political, administrative and military leadership respectively in the triumphant war against the Tigers.

From what has been reported in the media so far and from what I have been able to gather through my own sources the current situation and background in brief seems to be this.

Officially Sanctioned Unofficial Executions
The Rajapaksa govt resorted to several unorthodox measures in prosecuting the war. Officially sanctioned unofficial executionsof those perceived as enemies of the state and those portrayed as threats to national security were allegedly committed. Many were killed in cold blood or white vanned. It soon came to a point when dissidents or those expressing contrary views were also depicte as enemies,threats and traitors. The media was controlled or managed through a carrot and stick method. While one set of media personnel were given computers as carrots, another group of more independent journalists were administered the stick in small,medium and large doses.
Dealing with national security threats in the media was deemed necessary. A special unit was set up for this purpose specifically in late 2007 or early 2008. This squad consisted of specially selected operatives from the army and naval intelligence along with some underworld gangsters to provide a facade if and when necessary.
This unit operated out of the re-furbished Manning Market premises. The special unit was structurally semi-official and functionally autonomous. The unit was commanded by an officer who was subsequently promoted to the rank of Major. This unit commanding officer was not answerable to the Army commander or Military Intelligence chief. He reported to and took directives only from a single authority ensconced in the upper echelons of the defence establishment.
The rationale for setting up such a unit was to suppress or prevent any criticism of the manner in which the war was being conducted or the personal conduct of the top brass of the armed forces.
This was deemed necessary because it was important to ensure that the armed forces were not de-moralized in any way. The special unit would deal with the media while the armed forces could continue their fight against the LTTE. What happened as is usual in situations like this was that the thin line separating real and imaginary threats got blurred. Persons perceived as being critical of the regime or those offering constructive criticism were also regarded and treated as enemies and traitors. It was against this backdrop that this unit performed sordid tasks such as abductions, assaults, white vanning and attacks on media personnel. The most heinous crimes committed against journalists were arguably the killing of Lasantha and disappearance of Prageeth.

Top Rungs Of The Defence Establishment
The unfettered investigations conducted by the Police Criminal Investigation Department(CID) after the current govt assumed ofice has resulted in a breakthrough in the probe into Lasanthas killing. Telephone records have been meticulously delved into and many crucial calls traced. Even the telephone number from which the call was purportedly made ordering to give the works to Lasantha has been traced. The units commanding officer and most operatives have been identified. All the murderers involved in the assassination of Lasantha Wickrematunge have been identified. Vehicles used for attacks have been seized and the houses used as torture chambers have been located.Some of those involved in the assassination including a high ranking officer were produced in court and later released on bail. Several persons in the top rungs of the defence establishment including former defence secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa and Ex- Army chief Sarath Fonseka have been questioned.

Files have been sent to the Attorney - Generals Department it is learnt. It appears from all accounts that there is enough evidence for a Prima Facie case in the murder of Lasantha Wickrematunge
Files have been sent to the Attorney - Generals Department it is learnt. It appears from all accounts that there is enough evidence for a Prima Facie case in the murder of Lasantha Wickrematunge. But matters have not procceeded to the stage of indictment and prosecution due to the lack of political will. The Sirisena-Wickremesinghe regime calls itself a unity govt but the reality is that of strong disunity both at the top as well as the rank and file. The recent Treasury bond scam carnival as well as President Sirisenas threats of swordplay have proved the existence of a great divide beyond doubt. Hence most issues are approached divisively.Confusion is compounded.
This bi-furcated approach often working at cross purposes seems to be the root cause of perceived lethargy on the question of Wickrematunges murder. One school of thought opines that President Sirisena is allegedly responsible for the delay as he does not want members of the armed forces to be prosecuted at this point of time. Moreover there is speculation that President Sirisena enjoys a special relationship with ex defence secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa. It is also a blatant fact that Maithripala strove shamelessly to strike up a deal with the Mahinda faction for the local authority polls. The possibility of a Mahinda-Maithripala rapprochement after polls is not entirely ruled out by political analysts.
The United National Party(UNP) on the other hand faces an embarassing difficulty. The UNP including Ranil Wickremesinghe blamed former Army commander Sarath Fonseka for Lasanthas killing at that time. Some UNP stalwarts went on record that a unit under Fonsekas supervision was responsible for the attacks on media personnel. One does not know whether the UNP allegations against Fonseka were correct or incorrect or partly correct. But the fact remains that Sarath Fonseka is today a cabinet minister of this UNP led government and is the UNP organizer for Kelaniya. So where does the UNP stand on the allegations levelled by that party against Sarath Fonseka over the killing of Lasantha Wickramatunge Apart from the Fonny factor there is also a viewpoint that the UNP is soft pedalling the issue in order to weaken the divided SLFP further.

In The Court Of Public Opinion
One does not know whether the theories and hypotheses being propounded are right or wrong, but the fact remains that no tangible progress by way of indictment and prosecution has been made. Nine years has passed since Lasantha Wickramatunge was assassinated on January 8th. Three years has passed since Maithripala Sirisena was elected president on January 8th. The killers of Lasantha Wickrematunge are yet to be brought to justice. As stated before Lasanthas killing is an emblematic case of tremendous significance. Until and unless this Govt secures justice for Lasantha Wickrematunge , this Govt will remain in the dock at the court of public opinion both nationally and internationally.
President Sirisena who is learning the intricacies of swordsmanship has been silent about Lasantha Wickramatunge on January 8th. Perhaps more important matters like obtaining a one year extension of his term of office may have occupied the presidential mind.Prime minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and Media minister Mangala Samaraweera who both interacted closely with Lasantha, have chosen to issue statements. The Prime Ministers statement was in general about the third anniversary of President Sirisenas election on Jan 8th with particular references to the slaying of Wickramatunge.
Premier Wickremesinghe in his statement said One of the most heroic victims of this culture of brutality, Lasantha Wickramatunge, wrote in his last ever editorial of how it was the family of President Mahinda Rajapaksa that operated what he called the machinery of the state. His editorial, written in anticipation of his own murder, could not have been clearer: Now, it is clear to all who will see that machinery has operated so well that my sons and daughter do not themselves have a father.
Today, three years from the inception of the Unity government, also marks nine years from the date that Lasantha Wickramatunge was killed. We vowed then, that his killers would face justice, as would the perpetrators of so many acts of violence perpetrated against media personnel in the dark days of the former regime. The government remains committed to this goal, which is an essential step in allowing the country to permanently rise out from under the threat of lawless rule by the sword.

Fearless Editor Of The Sunday Leader
Finance and media minister Mangala Samaraweera issued a statement specifically relating to Lasantha. Mangala said in his statement - Today, 8 January 2018, marks the ninth anniversary of one of the most heinous crimes ever committed against Sri Lankas constitutionally guaranteed right to freedom of expression. It was nine years ago, today, at 10:45 a.m. that I received the news that Lasantha Wickramatunge, the fearless editor of The Sunday Leader, and my dear friend, had been ambushed and attacked as he drove to work. A few hours later when Lasantha succumbed to his injuries, Sri Lanka lost one of the most enigmatic and courageous journalists that the world had ever known
In the aftermath of this cowardly assassination, the media, legal fraternity, civil society and the political opposition parties joined together as one, demanding justice for Lasantha by way of a thorough and impartial investigation and condemning those who gave aid, comfort and shelter to his killers. For six years, we struggled in vain, until on 8 January 2015, the people of Sri Lanka threw out the Rajapaksa regime and placed their faith in the Unity Government led by President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickramesinghe Our moral and civic duty to demand justice for Lasantha has been replaced with the responsibility for delivering that justice, by enabling and ensuring a thorough and impeccably independent police investigation, led by the officers of the Criminal Investigation Department. This investigation has already exposed the intricacy of the measures taken by the previous regime to cover up the murder. From the false cause of death in the original post-mortem report to the irregular transfer of the investigation away from the CID, and the death of a key witness-turned-suspect in custody, it is clear that no stone was left unturned

One does not know whether the theories and hypotheses being propounded are right or wrong, but the fact remains that no tangible progress by way of indictment and prosecution has been made

Despite these and whatever obstacles that come before us, this Government is committed to providing the CID and the Attorney Generals Department with whatever resources and support they require to indict and convict those who committed, aided and instigated Lasanthas murder. Failure is unacceptable. This is a debt of honour that we owe not just to Lasantha and his family, but also to the citizens of Sri Lanka, who have been deprived of one of the foremost champions of their democracy.

Conviction In a CourtOf Law
Today, I call upon all media institutions, the legal fraternity, private sector and civil society organisations, once again to unite with us in rendering all possible aid to the police in this investigation, by seeking out and volunteering relevant information, identifying and safeguarding possible witnesses and responding to any requests promptly and thoroughly. Only by the conviction in a court of law of those responsible for this insoluble bloodstain in our national history can we honour Lasanthas sacrifice.
So Prime minister Ranil Wickremesinghe assures us that President Sirisena and he remain committed to the vow of making Lasanthas killers face justice. Media minister Mangala Samaraweera has reiterated that  this Government was committed to providing the CID and the Attorney Generals Department with whatever resources and support they require to indict and convict those who committed, aided and instigated Lasanthas murder. He further says Failure is unacceptable.
Fighting words indeed from the Prime minister and Media minister. Too much time has been spent in talk without any action. It is time for the Sirisena-Wickremesinghe government in general and the United National Party (UNP) to stop talking the talk and instead start walking the walk The NATO syndrome of no action talk only must be abandoned. Meaningful constructive action must be taken to bring to book the assassins of Lasantha Wickrematunge. Both the arrows as well as the archers.
Lasantha Manilal Wickramatunges 60th Birthday falls on April 5. It is to be hoped that his killers would have been indicted by that date.

Mentor and Mother for all Gothamians and Us
	
Mrs. Soma Premaratne
Of all the gifts that nature could offer, the greatest of them all is a
loving mother
How do children remember their mother, when they themselves have lived through life to be grandparents Certainly not in the way their children would think about them. These are two different eras with two completely different social values and lifestyles. Ours we live with nostalgia our parents still dominate.
This is written on our beloved mothers 11th death anniversary that falls on January 15, 2018 in gratitude to all what she has done for us and a countless number of deserving others in recollecting most cherished memories by most who associated with her.
Our mother is best remembered at home as a very devoted housewife despite her career as a school teacher, a school principal, a social worker and a very affectionate wife of a public servant who was extremely principled and burdened with State responsibility sitting in a high position, he was very seriously attending to. Yet she was able to balance all of it with ease and efficiently. The responsibility was immense but the challenge was well taken up. We as children never felt any friction at home that we as parents live through with stress with the present day hectic life. Perhaps they dealt with stress too, handling the responsibilities they had to at home and at work. Yet with our mother, we were never allowed to feel they were stressed. She knew to go about with children, at home and at school. 
She was a woman driven by compassion, faith, commitment, justice and a heart full of love and happiness to all around her. She was an inspiration, a tower of strength for many families and individuals in difficult times. She had her own resolution in life to move without frustration and dejection. There was nothing she would say is difficult. Its how much you put in to achieve what you want. To us she would say, try a little harder.
That made her the most loved Principal at Gothami Balika Vidyalaya, Colombo for two decades. When she, Soma Premaratne was appointed principal in 1956, it was to the Government English Girls School, Maradana. She took over from Mrs. Gladys Perera after Mrs. Pereras retirement from service. Mrs. Perera had managed the school with commitment but with scarce resources. It was a small primary school in Temple Road, serving the not so affluent in and around Maradana and therefore was not one that was noticed and recognised by the authorities and the people.
Our mother gave her whole life to this small and unrecognised school that Gothamians are now proud of. Her steeled commitment to raise the quality and standard of this school for the underprivileged was such, in everything she did the school was her lifes priority. So much so, when she was asked if she would take up the post of Principal in one of the most privileged girls school in Colombo to date, she opted to remain with the Government English Girls School, Maradana. She changed the medium of teaching in this school from English to Sinhala and changed the name of the school to Gothami Balika Vidyalaya. We believe she was fortunate in having a tutorial staff that was committed in delivering what she wanted. A strict disciplinarian, she was also of mind that a student would not grow into a complete Citizen unless she or he is allowed time for cultural life. It was this philosophy of hers that allowed us, her children to indulge in extracurricular activities in school.
At Gothami Balika Vidyalaya too, she had very good support to initiate many extracurricular activities. Over the years, Gothamians excelled in netball and athletics. They were into literature and drama.
Now a national school, Gothami as it is now popularly called, became a school with a demand within a decade. During that first 10 years of her stewardship as principal, Gothami had grown from a small primary school with a small building , to a reputed school in Colombo with over two thousand children enjoying all the facilities they needed, able to study science, arts and commerce for the Advance Level examination. Three prominent school buildings were constructed and the Budu Medura which stands prominently at the entrance was done on her initiative. Gothami kept growing during the next 10 years of our mothers service as Principal for 20 consecutive years ending in 1976. Gothamians are no doubt proud of their school and have bestowed our mother with honour, by naming a new and a modern school building as Soma Premaratne Hall. She was not only a Principal but a mother and a friend to thousands of school children and gave them a tradition that helped them achieve their lifes aspirations. Many excel in specialised fields and have reached high positions not only here, but in other parts of the world too.
She was Mrs. Premaratne to her teachers, friends and students. Soma Akka to her relatives Aunty Soma to the younger generation in our extended family circle and then lately, Aththammi  to her grandchildren and kids. She had a few charming phrases often heard when she wanted to get things done. Aney was how she started off when she had most to do what she wanted and they did quite willingly.
There were a few passions and interests she found time for within her heavy daily workload. She was a very good painter for one who did not share them publicly. Some of her paintings were truly amazing! She also took a keen interest in sewing and cooking whenever time permits in spite of her busy schedule and without exaggeration, she enjoyed them both.
She also managed a small two room annex at our premises at 5, Havelock Rd. where many individuals who later excelled in many disciplines in the state and private sector were resident. For her, they were also like us, her own and never the Land lady
She was a devoted Buddhist too and that perhaps was how the Government English Girls School came to be named as Gothami Balika Vidyalaya. A convinced Buddhist more than a traditional Buddhist, she gave to the needy and the deserving in society, her utmost kindness and compassion. Despite her responsibilities as a Principal and a mother volunteered with Sri Lanka Sumithrayo as an advisor for persons who needed emotional support. She also helped to rehabilitate street children devoting her time to teach at a centre in Mettaramaya temple, Bambalapitiya.
Life for her was such, she was to parent us alone as our father was called to rest at a young age when we all needed him too. She was not one who wanted to live in despair. She kept life going for us with love and care. She accommodated our childhood pranks at times with a smile and at times with a stern look when the necessity arises.
And for all that, thank you for being the mother you were to us and the grandma you were to our children. For the mentor you were for Gothamians, you will live for generations, no doubt.
May you attain the supreme bliss
of Nibbana.
Chandima and Udeni

Merkel party a step closer to new coalition government
	

AFP, 12th JANUARY, 2018 - German Chancellor Angela Merkels conservatives reached a breakthrough deal Friday with the countrys second biggest party, the Social Democrats, toward building a new coalition government, sources close to the negotiators said.
After more than 24 hours of talks, party chiefs reached an in-principle deal to start formal coalition talks that could lead in the coming months to a new government for the biggest EU economy, the sources told AFP.
In the all-night talks in Berlin, the party chiefs -- Merkel of the Christian Democrats as well as Social Democrats (SPD) leader Martin Schulz and the head of Merkels Bavarian allies, Horst Seehofer -- and their negotiators hammered out a 28-page joint paper that will form the basis for the talks ahead.
Potential pitfalls remain, including votes by sceptical SPD delegates and later the labour partys rank-and-file members that could yet give the thumbs down to another left-right grand coalition, the constellation that has ruled Germany for the past four years.

Rajagiriya flyover, Moragahakanda -- Rajapaksa must be day dreaming: Thalatha
	
Foreign Employment and Justice Minister Thalatha Atukorale yesterday rejected claims made by former president Mahinda Rajapaksa that the Rajagiriya flyover and the Moragahakanda Multi-Purpose Development Project (MMDP) were planned by his government.
She told a gathering at Ratnapura that Mr. Rajapaksa had also made similar claims during the construction of the Mahaweli Development Project.
Mr. Rajapaksa must be day dreaming, the minister said.
She said it was uncertain whether Mr. Rajapaksa was aware of the construction of the Rajagiriya flyover but might have been planning how to earn his portion of the commission from the projects which had been carried out under his government.
Several people are asking us about the work we have done for past two years. The country has been destroyed by these people during the past ten years, the minister said and added that some political parties were attempting to label Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe as a thief and said she was prepared to give up her portfolio if any such allegation was proved in the court of law.

SC ruling: Prez tears packet of gravy and spills it all over
	
The joint opposition (JO) said yesterday said the President has torn his packet of gravy and it has spilled all over by seeking a Supreme Court determination on the expiry of his term of office.
According to the presidents office, President Maithripala Sirisena has sought a Supreme Court determination to ascertain when his term of office ends in the wake of the 19th Amendment to Constitution reducing the President's tenure from the earlier six years to five.
MP Rohitha Abeygunawardena told a news conference that by seeking a determination from the SC, the President has torn the gravy packet and spilled it all over Kole Iragena, ange halagena,
He said the seeking of a clarification on the President's tenure would not impact on the local government elections.
The MP said the 19th Amendment to the Constitution was a hoax.
Where is the independent police commission and the independent elections commission Had there been an independent elections commission, the LG election would have been held already, he said and added that the Rajagiriya flyover had been vested with the public after reducing its length.
The flyover should have been longer. The government has deviated from the original plan, he said adding that others were attempting to score points using development projects initiated by the previous government.
This is similar to someone wearing borrowed clothes and flaunting them saying it belongs to them, he said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

Seeking SC determination; UNP says Prez should have consulted Govt. allies
	
The United National Party (UNP) said yesterday it would have been much better for President Maithripala Sirisena to have consulted the government allies before seeking a determination from the Supreme Court on the expiry of his term of office.
In an interview with Daily Mirror, Minister and House Leader Lakshman Kiriella said this had caused some uneasiness among the government allies.
He said even if the Court ruled it to be at the end of six years, the President had the option of calling for an early presidential election at the end of five years.
The Supreme Court is expected to convey its determination to the President on Sunday.
With Parliament approving the 19th Amendment to the Constitution the President's term of office was reduced from the previous six years to five creating an ambiguity. (Kelum Bandara)

Smuggled ivory worth almost half a million dollars seized in Thailand
	

DPA, 12th JANUARY, 2018 - Ivory worth 15 million baht (469,800 dollars) smuggled from Nigeria has been seized in Thailand, customs officials said on Friday.
Three elephant tusks and 31 ivory pieces weighing a combined 148 kilograms were seized at Suvarnabhumi International Airport in Bangkok, Kulit Sombatsiri, director general of the customs department told a press conference.
The smuggled goods were shipped from the Nigerias commercial centre of Lagos to Bangkok on an Ethiopian Airlines flight on December 20.
Two weeks later, as no one came to pick up the packages, airport officials opened them up to find the smuggled goods, Kulit said.
The registered address in Thailand also doesnt exist, the director general said.
The massive size of the tusks indicate that they did not belong to Thai elephants. We will need to conduct a DNA test to determine where they really come from, he added.
Ivory trade has been outlawed under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES), but smuggling from Africa into Asia persists.

Trump dismisses Haiti, African countries with vulgarity
	

President Donald Trump on Thursday questioned why the United States would want to have immigrants from Haiti and African nations, referring to some as shithole countries, according to two sources familiar with the comments.
Trumps remarks, made in the White House, came as Democratic Senator Dick Durbin and Republican Senator Lindsey Graham briefed the president on a newly drafted immigration bill being touted by a bipartisan group of senators, according to the sources, who asked not to be identified.
Other government officials were present during the conversation, the sources said.
The lawmakers were describing how certain immigration programs operate, including one to give safe haven in the United States to people from countries suffering from natural disasters or civil strife.
One of the sources who was briefed on the conversation said that Trump said, Why do we want all these people from Africa here Theyre shithole countries ... We should have more people from Norway.
The second source familiar with the conversation, said Trump, who has vowed to clamp down on illegal immigration, also questioned the need for Haitians in the United States.
Many Democrats and some Republican lawmakers slammed the president for his remarks.
Republican U.S. Representative Mia Love, a daughter of Haitian immigrants, said the comments were unkind, divisive, elitist, and fly in the face of our nations values and called on Trump to apologize to the American people and to the countries he denigrated.
Another Republican Representative, Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, who was born in Cuba and whose south Florida district includes many Haitian immigrants, said: Language like that shouldnt be heard in locker rooms and it shouldnt be heard in the White House.

Trump to extend Iran sanctions relief, keeping nuclear deal intact
	

REUTERS, 12th JANUARY, 2018 - U.S. President Donald Trump will extend sanctions relief granted to Iran under its 2015 nuclear deal with the United States and other world powers, leaving the accord intact for now, according to a person familiar with the decision.
However, Trump, who has vowed to scrap the pact, was expected to give the U.S. Congress and European allies a deadline for improving it, the person said. Without improvements, Trump would renew his threat to withdraw from the agreement. Trump had faced a Friday deadline to decide on whether to waive the sanctions. A decision to withhold a waiver would have effectively ended the deal that limits Irans nuclear program. The White House is expected to announce the decision on Friday.
While Trump approved a sanctions waiver, he also decided to impose new, targeted sanctions on Iran, the person said.
