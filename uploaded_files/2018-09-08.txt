Brazil poll front-runner stabbed at rally
	
?
Brazil?s right-wing presidential frontrunner Jair Bolsonaro was stabbed and seriously injured while campaigning with police saying the suspect claimed to be acting on orders from God.??
It was the latest bizarre twist in a presidential race in which the most popular candidate, former president and leftist hero Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, is trying to run from prison.??
The Supreme Court disqualified Lula on Thursday. First round voting is scheduled for October 7.??
Bolsonaro underwent surgery for multiple wounds his mid-section and was listed in stable condition after the attack during a walkabout in the southeastern city of Juiz de Fora.??
Images shared on social media and Brazilian television showed Bolsonaro being carried on the shoulders of a throng of supporters before a man lunges at his stomach.??
A witness told police the attacker held a knife wrapped up in a shirt and attacked Bolsonaro as the group hoisting him walked by.??
The attacker was arrested right away. He was identified as Adelio Bispo de Oliveira, 40, and said to be a member of the left-leaning PSOL party from 2007 to 20014.??
After his arrest, Bispo de Oliveira said he was ?carrying out a divine mission, a mission from God,? said Luis Boundens, head of a union of federal police officers.??
Bolsonaro, a former military man and lawmaker, has been criticized for outbursts deemed racist, misogynist and homophobic.??
Bispo de Oliveira acted ?for religious reasons, for political reasons, and also because of the prejudice Bolsonaro has always shown when he talks about race, religion and even women,? said his lawyer, Pedro Augusto Lima Possa.

## Title: DISCOURAGING UNCONSCIONABLE STRIKES
## Section: Opinion

DISCOURAGING UNCONSCIONABLE STRIKES
	
The citizens of this country are utterly disappointed by the government?s pusillanimous responses to the profusion of unconscionable strikes that are called by various groups that cause immense inconvenience and hardship, loss of time and money, and even deprivation of life and limb of fellow citizens. The timing and nature of most of the strikes that have taken place over the past 3-4 years indicate that the motivation behind them is less the direct self-interest of the strikers and more the unscrupulous political objectives of?their leaders.? ?
The first step that must be taken to deal with strikes by State employees is for the President and the Prime Minister to act together in a manner that is consistent with their powerful but interdependent positions. They must stop pussy-footing in the face of threats by crooked strike leaders whose demands get more and more outrageous in the face of hesitant governmental responses. These two most senior elected personages should stop fighting each other for their personal benefit, give much less importance to elections and their candidatures for presidency, and work more for the country. They should cut down severely on their excessive overseas visits, most of which have contributed little or no perceptible benefit to?
Sri Lanka and, instead, spend more time to deal constructively to stop strikes taking place. Most of all, they have to cooperate with each other and not allow anything they say or do to undermine the position of the other, however subtly such things are done. There could be nothing more advantageous to their common opponents than to see these two powerful entities back-stabbing each other whilst uncontrolled strikes continue to destroy any semblance of serious governance and economic growth.?
Giving in to the demands presented by one group of strikers often leads to a domino-type succession of fresh strikes called by other groups trying to get to the head of the queue. Piecemeal solutions given to strikers? demands almost automatically sow the seeds of an unwelcome harvest of new strikes. Therefore, if one wishes to forestall the domino effect of a settlement of one group?s grievances leading to an immediate call by some other group to make corresponding enhancements of its own remuneration and benefits, it would be imperative to have a comprehensive, balanced, legally-enforceable, overall schedule of remuneration and benefits covering all employee classifications.
?
Giving in to the demands presented by one group of strikers often leads to a domino-type succession of fresh strikes called by other groups trying to get to the head of the queue
?If one?s memory were to be relied upon, about two decades ago, Mr. Tissa Devendra was appointed to head a committee that was tasked with working out an equitable system of grading and rewarding all public servants. Unfortunately, political stupidity brought this exercise to a premature halt. President Sirisena has now appointed a high-powered committee to do something on similar lines before the end of October this year. Whereas this is a commendable move, it is doubtful whether the views of all affected parties could be collected and evaluated objectively for inclusion in the committee?s report within the short time available. Consequently, there is bound to be a need soon thereafter for clarification and amplification of the proposals that the new committee may be expected to put forward.?
In the circumstances, apart from what is being done hurriedly, legislation should be brought in to classify all State employment as being of a fundamentally ?essential? character so that all those in State employment shall be bound by certain overall rules that would ensure conformity with this concept. There should be a formal mechanism for examining, within a specified time frame, all claims that could lead to strike action and a strict procedure set out to be followed both by potential strikers and by the government to help arrive at a timely solution.?
It is plain common-sense that the absence of employees in any department whatsoever of government at a time when they should be at work inevitably results in wasted effort, wasted time and wasted money for members of the public who require official inputs of a thousand different kinds. Delays in securing official endorsement and approvals could mean that affected citizens could, in certain situations, suffer life-changing reverses. Any responsible person could readily envisage the damaging impact of such setbacks in countless critical situations.? If the principle that all public servants are ?essential? is enforced, any of them going on strike, without following clearly set out procedures for resolving whatever claims they may put forward from time to time, would be a violation of their terms of employment and a serious anti-social act for which there should be deterrent punishment. In this context, the most effective disincentive that would inhibit trade unions and other organised groups from breaking contracts irresponsibly or with an illegitimate collateral purpose would be the confiscation of property of not only the leaders of the illegally-striking unions or similar groupings but the individual strikers as well. Most specifically, any demand that is not strictly and solely related to the legitimate welfare of the strikers alone should be made a crime. In the current context, the most glaring example of a trade union that insists on blackmailing the government and the people of Sri? Lanka to accommodate the political agendas of its leaders rather than the protection of the rights of its members is the Government Medical Officers? Association (GMOA). We have, in an earlier article, equated its methods with those of the LTTE and the ISIS whose principal weapon of persuasion involved putting the lives of innocent civilians in extreme peril. The GMOA?s methodology has worsened in the interim.?
It would, of course, not be enough to have a wide-ranging document that assigns pay scales and perquisites in keeping with the qualifications, special skills, age limits, work experience, physical risks faced, uncongenial conditions of work and so on. There would need to be appropriate complementary documents that set out the conditions of service and the rules to be observed, individually and collectively, by all employees to resolve administrative errors and unjust treatment. There is already a large volume of official rules and regulations and all that would be required would be the careful revision and editing of this material to suit the new mechanism and procedures.?
Although all State employment must, without exception, be classified as ?essential?, it would be necessary, for practical reasons, to subdivide the types of services rendered by State employees into three broad categories and to adjust the remuneration and conditions of employment in keeping with the different responsibilities, risks and hours of work that each category would have to take on, as briefly outlined below.?
Category 1 of the ?essential? services would be those whose place of work and the number of hours to be worked are those that would apply to those engaged almost exclusively in administrative or other regular work. They would not be exposed to any significant work-related risks. About the only time that they would be called upon to work outside their offices and routine ?rounds? would be if and when they are called upon to perform election duties.?
?
There needs to be a comparative evaluation of the degree of disruptiveness to the life of the employee that would be inherent in the many different types of jobs in government service and appropriate categorization should be worked out on the lines suggested above
Category 2 of the ?essential? services would be those whose working hours are controlled by timetables, as in the transport business, or who have to work shifts to run public utilities such as the supply, distribution and maintenance of electricity, water and so on during nights, weekends, public holidays etc. Moreover, some doctors, some nurses, most customs officials and immigration officials may also fit into this classification.?
Category 3 would be those who not only have to work in the areas of maintaining law and order, fire-fighting, armed services and so on, but are often called upon to work irregular, long hours and occasionally face risk of death and injury from criminals, terrorists, protestors, strikers and other sources. Bomb disposal is another speciality within this group.?
In summary, all government employment must be considered to be ?essential?. There needs to be a comparative evaluation of the degree of disruptiveness to the life of the employee that would be inherent in the many different types of jobs in government service and appropriate categorization should be worked out on the lines suggested above. An overall organisational structure and corresponding rewards should be fashioned so as to match the combination of qualifications, experience, responsibilities, working hours, job-related risks and so on to help assign suitable positions in government service to the different categories. There must be a streamlined mechanism and simple procedures to solve differences between the State and its employees without allowing any wounds to fester out of control indefinitely, especially by ministers who procrastinate because they do not possess the skills to deal with human resources problems.?
?
President, PM must stop pussy-footing in the face of threats by crooked strike leaders?
	Any demand that is not strictly and solely related to the legitimate welfare of the strikers alone should be made a crime
	Need a streamlined mechanism to solve differences between the State and its employees

The government presented a supplementary estimate to seek parliamentary approval to spend rupees Rs.1 million for the Gamperaliya inauguration programme in Kurunegala.
Approval was also sought for the allocation of Rs.500,000 million for Gamperaliya projects.
JVP MP Bimal Ratnayake who asked a question said one million rupees was not the total amount spent for the Gamperaliya inauguration ceremony. He said the main issue is the absence of guidelines to curb spending for the state functions.

Happy birthday, mum
	
Rani Moraes (4th September 1931 ? 7th April 2018)??
It?s almost five months since you left us. As your birthday approaches, for the first time, since your absence, I look on it with dread. I can?t go and pore over birthday cards, select a gift, or plan a party?so many happy memories of years gone by and the happy times we had celebrating your birthday. It?s tough and I am left wishing that I had at least one more!??
If I could have one day more, only one more, I would hold your hand and tell you that I love you, hoping you would hear me and understand, remembering who I was. I would thank you for all you gave me and for the many, many sacrifices you made. And I would thank you most of all for passing on to me the legacy of true Christian faith, which you upheld to the end.??
I can?t say truthfully that it was all smooth sailing, sweetness and joy. We had many differences, but it took nothing away from the love we shared.??
Thank you too for not being the stereotypical mother. You were a maverick, you were funny ? sometimes hilarious, but beneath all the jokes and arguments. Pradeep and I knew that you had such pride and belief in us (sometimes misplaced), and had the ability to see God?s hand in all twists and turns that led to a better tomorrow.??
If I could, I would turn back the clock to when you were you, and your mind was ?sharp as a two-edged sword? (as you would constantly remind us), and you would look back at me and comprehend all I struggle to say now.??
I pray that you are celebrating your birthday in heaven with Thaaththa, and that heaven is all you dreamed it to be. Fanciful as I am, I wish that? even in a dream ? I could spend a day with you: a day from years past when you were strong, well and happy, free of pain. I?d run to you and hold you tight.??
And we would laugh once more.??
Happy birthday, mum. Love always.??

Knowledge is power, information liberates
	
Today is the United Nation?s International Literacy Day and the world body says it gives an opportunity for governments, civil society and stakeholders to highlight improvements in world literacy rates, and reflect on the world?s remaining literacy challenges.??
The issue of literacy is a key component of the UN?s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and its 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. The SDGs adopted by world leaders in September 2015, promotes, as part of its agenda, universal access to quality education and learning opportunities throughout people?s lives. Sustainable Development Goal 4 has as one of its targets ensuring all young people achieve literacy and numeracy and that adults who lack these skills are given the opportunity to acquire them, the UN says.? ?
This year?s theme is ?Literacy and skills development.? Despite progress made, literacy challenges persist, and at the same time the demands for skills required for work, evolve rapidly. This year?s theme explores integrated approaches that simultaneously support the development of literacy and skills, to ultimately improve people?s lives and work and contribute to equitable and sustainable societies. The day focuses on skills and competencies required for employment, careers, and livelihoods, particularly technical and vocational skills, along with transferable skills and digital skills, the UN says.??
September 8 was proclaimed International Literacy Day by the United Nations Education, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO) at the 14th session of UNESCO?s General Conference on October 26, 1966 to remind the international community of the importance of literacy for individuals, communities and societies, and the need for intensified efforts towards more literate societies.??
The idea of an International Literacy Day was proposed at the World Conference of Ministers of Education on the Eradication of Illiteracy. This was held at Teheran in Iran from September 8-19 in 1965. The conference in its final report said, ?the development of the modern world, the accession to independence of a large number of countries, the need for the real emancipation of people and for the increasingly-active and productive participation, in the economic, social and political life of human society, of the hundreds of millions of illiterate adults still existing in the world, make it essential to change national education policies. Education systems must provide for the educational training needs of both the young generations who have not yet begun working life, and the generations that have already become adult without having had the benefit of the essential minimum of elementary education.National educational plans should include schooling for children and literacy training for adults as parallel elements.???
Just as knowledge, skills and competencies evolve in the digital world, so does what it means to be literate. To bridge the literacy skills gap and reduce inequalities, last year?s International Literacy Day highlighted the challenges and opportunities in promoting literacy in the digital world, a world where, despite progress, at least 750 million adults and 264 million out-of-school children still lack basic literacy skills.??
According to UNICEF, there has been little progress in improving access to education to children in the poorer regions, notably in South Asia, West Asia (Middle East) and sub-Saharan Africa where there are still 123 million school-age children without schools.UNESCO reports more than 75% of the world?s 781 million illiterate adults are found in South Asia, West Asia, sub-Saharan Africa. Women represent almost two-thirds of all illiterate adults globally.??
Though South Asia is among the areas demarcated as having the highest illiteracy rates, two South Asian countries stand out having exceptionally-high literacy rates worldwide. The Maldives has a literacy rate of 99% and Sri Lanka 92%. Yet at the time Sri Lanka received independence from Britain in 1946, the literacy rate in the country stood at a mere 57.8%, with female literacy being 43.8% and male literacy 70.1%. C.W.W. Kannangara?s pre-education policy is widely acclaimed as being the main reason for this.?
Sri Lanka?s coalition government has almost doubled the allocation for education and introduced a policy, where every student will have at least thirteen years of education. Even those who fail at the GCE Ordinary Level examination will be able to continue to a higher level where they will have access to a multitude of vocational training skills including high technology and digital training. Education will be largely job-oriented with the government assuring about one million new and productive jobs before 2020.? ?
Former UN Secretary General Kofi Annan who died recently, has said ?Knowledge is power. Information is liberating. Education is the premise of progress, in every society, in every family.? We hope Sri Lanka?s new education policy will produce more skilled citizens, but also eco-friendly and responsible citizens who work for the common good of all instead of just personal gain, glory or other selfish ambitions.? ?

No Presidential election before schedule time ? President
	
President Maithripala Sirisena says today there is unnecessary concern in the country regarding the Presidential election and further said that even though some made statements that there will be a presidential election early, he is not ready in any way to hold a presidential election before it is due.?
President Sirisena also pointed out that he alone could decide on holding such election.
He made these remarks addressing the SLFP Nivitigala Bala Mandala meeting held at the Nivitigala public fair premises, today (08).
Expressing his views, the President further said that if SLPP and UNP overestimate their political power that is mistake and said that whatever value given by themselves to their parties no one could form a government without the support of the SLFP.
Political parties which emerge centering on individuals are temporarily and the country needs political movements with clear vision, the President pointed out. He stated that the SLFP which has a proper vision for the motherland is now moving forward successfully while strengthening its organizational structures.
Expressing his views further, the President said that according to the 19th amendment to the Constitution after the next presidential election the powers of the President will be limited and the key position of the government will be the post of Prime Minister and the discussion among the all who are in the political field should be selecting a better Prime Minister for the country but not concern about the next presidential election.
?Even though whatever allegations were leveled against me by the political opponents, I will continue to fulfill the duties toward the country, much more than anyone done in the past,? he said. He also said that he created an environment where a common man could reach the highest level while strengthening the democracy and vesting the superior powers of the Executive Presidency in the Parliament and no other leader in the world did so.
President Sirisena said that the true Bandaranaike policy and the policy of the SLPF is that and always the country needs those policies.
The President said that even though the main allegation against the SLFP is that it is joined with the UNP, it did so to fulfill some tasks which could not be fulfilled by the previous government and the President recalled that today the government was able to win the support of the international community and those cooperation is now using for the benefit of the country.
The President said that he is scheduled to address the UN Assembly in 24 th of this month and he is expected to made a new statement before the Assembly to free the security forces from the allegations leveled against them.
Expressing his views regarding the development activities of the Rathnapura district the President said that he will instruct the relevant authorities and the Police to allow the people to engage in gem mining using kooda cane-sacs in rivers and canals in the area from this week.
The President felicitating 10 senior members of the Rathnapura district SLFP and presented awards for them for their long period of contribution for the development of the SLFP.

On this day Oh beautiful Mother?..
	
The Catholic Church celebrates with great honour the birthday of the Blessed Virgin Mary on the 8th of September every year. In many churches, this feast culminates with the cutting of a ?Birthday Cake? which is shared by all. Roman Catholics celebrate the births of only three persons. Our Lord Jesus Christ, the Blessed Virgin, Mary, and St. John the Baptist. We celebrate all three birthdays for the same reason; all three were born without Original Sin. Christ, because He was conceived by the Holy Spirit; Mary, because she was kept free from the stain of Original Sin by the action of God in His foreknowledge that she would agree to be the mother of Christ; and Saint John, because he was blessed in the womb by the presence of his Savior when Mary, pregnant with Jesus, came to aid her cousin Elizabeth in the final months of Elizabeth?s pregnancy. This is a day of obligation or in other words, a day on which Catholics are obliged to attend Holy Mass and engage in rest from work and other acts which may hinder them from worship owed to the Lord.??
?You may wonder why September 8th has been so deemed to be the birthday of the Virgin. It falls exactly nine months after December 8th the feast of the Immaculate Conception of Mary. The term Immaculate Conception does not refer to the conception of Jesus as many erroneously think, but to the Conception of Mother Mary in the womb of St. Anne, her mother. Mary?s father, Joachim, was considered a wealthy man, a member of one of the twelve tribes of Israel and Joachim and Anne were very worried because of their childlessness which grieved them deeply. They engaged rigorously in prayer and fasting wondering if their inability to conceive a child was because of God?s displeasure with them. As it turned out, they were blessed even more abundantly when an angel appeared to Anne and prophesied to her that in future all generations would honour their future child.??
Saint Augustine described the birth of the Blessed Virgin Mary as an event of cosmic and historic significance, and an appropriate prelude to the birth of Jesus Christ. ?She is the flower of the field from whom bloomed the precious lily of the valley,? he said.??
Let us celebrate the birth of our blessed mother with the honour she deserves and ask her to intercede with Jesus on our behalf in our hour of need, as He had done so many times when He was requested to do so, by His mother so long ago.? ? ?

Ragging- Take action against Uni students responsible: Prez
	
President Maithripala Sirisena said yesterday he had instructed the Universities and law enforcement authorities to file charges against university students implicated in ragging because the government would not allow extremist elements to destroy the future of these students.
He said though there were laws to punish those found guilty of ragging, the laws remained unused and ineffective.
?I have instructed the relevant authorities to file charges against university students who are guilty of ragging. They are not concerned about the future of their victims who are harassed and suffer mentally and physically. There are instances ragging victims commiting suicide or die from the inhumane treatment meted out by the seniors. This must be stopped once and for all,? the President said.
He said this at a ceremony to launch the construction of the Vocational Training Institute at a cost of Rs.700 million at Hingurakgoda under the ?Pibidemu Polonnaruwa? project.
The President said the ragging menace was instigated by a small group of extremist political elements and they have brainwashed the a few undergrads to carry out unlawful, unethical, uncivilized and inhuman ragging on other innocent undergraduates.
He said anti-ragging laws were introduced in the 1990s during the time of the then Education Minister Richard Pathirana but the succesive governments had done little or nothing to enforce those laws. "It is sad that the Peradeniya University has been closed for more than a month," the President said. (Sandun Jayasekera and K.G. Karunaratne)

It will discuss the suitability of including hate speech as a crime in the Penal Code, categorizing the schools system on non racial or no religious basis, on establishing a parliamentary committee empowered to entertain complaints about the issues faced by minority ethnic groups in the North and the East, on formulating relevant legal provisions required for general implementation of the law when establishing places of worship and erecting statues and look into the possibility of banning news which disturb national amity.

Remembering ?Agale? our rugby captain
	
?Sampath Agalawatta
1984 team get together
?
Death is certain. We come with nothing into this world and will go with nothing, but our impact on those we encountered will last a lifetime.? ?
Our friend, our teammate and our workmate Sampath Agalawatte passed away on August 29. His funeral, in accordance with his wishes, was to be held within 24 hours of his passing. The irony of it all for me was that I could not physically be present to bid a final farewell to one of my closest friends, as I was stuck in the Kumana National Park. Life seemed to be so cruel for him as he was taken away from us so early. His parting came about ten days before his 53rd birthday. But whatever religion we believe in, there is a larger ?plan? in the works for all of us and it is left to those left behind to accept this reality and keep forging on. Yes, we knew the end was on the horizon once Agale?s diagnoses of Cadasil and cancer were confirmed, but it still makes one feel desolate about losing a loved one and a close friend. Agale was that to many people.? ?
Agale was a unique friend. He was quiet and reserved with a lot of people, but vivacious and hilarious when among his close friends. He would not let them down. He was ethical in dealing with the world, which was a very refreshing quality. In most instances, my experiences with him have been either black or white, no sitting on the proverbial fence. He was an old fashioned thinker on a personal level and at work, but you knew exactly where he stood with regard to issues. These rare qualities made working with him easy and straightforward, especially in the context of today?s corporate setting.? ?
He was always happy-go-lucky with his friends and if he was in a drinking mood (more like a gulping mood), we had to watch out; he danced, sang, shouted, pinched and screamed his lungs out in song during such times. He loved the Royal Thomian Cricket match and in the last 5-10 years if a Royalist scored a century, he would ingeniously find a way to avoid the stewards, prefects and security officials in making a beeline to the middle of the pitch to congratulate the century maker. The sheer joy he demonstrated in jinxing and sidestepping away from the stewards on his way to the pitch was his way of saying, ?Hey, I can still sidestep like I did during my playing days.?? ?
His love for his school and rugby were demonstrated when he joined our legendary coach, Summa Navaratnam to help coach our juniors (10 years and below), faithfully on most Friday afternoons and Sunday mornings. This was his dedication to his alma mater and the sport he loved the most.? ?
A few anecdotes of Agale.?
He was the Donhorst Prize Winner in 1984. Agale was very fond of my parents and used to visit our home quite often during our rugby-playing days. On a day soon after he had achieved this great accolade, he came to my home and my dad was in our living room at a meeting with the then presiding Bishop of Colombo, Bishop Swithin Fernando. My dad proudly announced to the Bishop that Sampath was the esteemed winner of the Donhorst Prize at Royal, the most coveted prize at College previously won by another distinguished Royal alumnus, the legendary Bishop Lakshman Wickremasinghe, Bishop of the Diocese of Kurunegala. Before Bishop Swithin could even respond, Agale took off like a jack rabbit saying, ?no, no, it?s not me.? He was too embarrassed and too modest to admit that he was the winner.? ?
Our 1984 Thailand trip with the rugby team trip was a hilarious time for all of us. A time of growing up! A time when boys became men. Most of us were flying for the first time, so getting on the flight was an experience in itself. Once our two matches were over, where we won one comfortably and lost the other one badly, we now had more enjoyable pursuits in mind ? shopping and having a drink, well?..soft drink! While I will spare the embarrassment of what some of our teammates got up to, another bunch were under the impression that in Thailand, if there was no price tag on an item in a store, those items were free. You could not see a more bemused look than the one on Agale when he along with a few of us were chased, yes, literally chased out of a shoe shop as soon as we entered. Why? Well the previous evening, some of our teammates had walked out of the store without paying for their items so when Agale and some other teammates showed up to ?claim? their free shoes, the store keepers were waiting for us. We thought Agale was fast on the field, but he was even faster than we had ever seen him fleeing from that irate store owner, faster than an antelope being chased by a leopard!??
We also had the constant ribbing of our teammates, specifically to figure out who actually captained and who would be the water boy. I guess this will be a joke for all our teammates who enjoyed this jostling of words for years. Let?s continue to do just that in the future as well.? ?
Agale, you will be missed, but not lost in our minds, you will be remembered as our friend, captain, work colleague and ?Amba Yahaluwa?. We will never forget you!? ?
A wise man told me about 19 years ago, don?t have regrets in life, but think of them as learning experiences and look to the future and not the past. And LIVE the future like tomorrow is your last day. Wise words indeed! So my teammates and friends, I hope you do the same. It is never too late.? ?
To Dilhani, Samali, Samal and Sahan, God?s Blessings. We will not go away and are only a phone call away. Stay strong, there is always a reason why God chose your loved one. He is in a better place.? ?
May you attain the supreme bliss of Nibbana, my friend. Rest in peace, my friend. You were a beacon of light to a lot of us. You keep looking out for us and we will do our best to Live it, Love it, Enjoy it and Share it ? Life, I mean.

SL?s leadership of CCM could serve as catalyst for other countries: Envoy
	
Sri Lanka?s leadership of the Convention on Cluster Munitions (CCM) could serve as a catalyst for and inspire other countries to appreciate the value of peace building, Sri Lanka?s Permanent Representative to the UN in Geneva A. L. A. Azeez said.
Delivering a speech on the assumption of Presidency of the 9th Meeting of the States Parties to the Convention on Cluster Munitions on Wednesday, Ambassador Azeez said.
He said Sri Lanka?s Presidency of the next meeting of the States Parties is historic for several reasons.
?Sri Lanka became a State Party to the Convention on 1 March 2018, barely six months ago. We did so after acceding to the Ottawa Convention banning anti-personnel landmines. This followed a very delicate national process, after having made considerable progress towards making Sri Lanka a landmine-free country. Taking resolute action to accede to the Convention on Cluster Munitions banning an injurious and indiscriminate conventional weapon category, which Sri Lanka had never used during its almost three decades-long conflict, was the next logical step to follow,? he said.
He also said Sri Lanka?s Presidency is an opportunity to clearly manifest both the commitment as well as the progress made in advancing reconciliation and peace building since the current Government came to office in 2015.
"Sri Lanka and its Presidency, supported by the Coordination Committee, would do all that is possible to strive towards realising this vision in the coming year-which also marks a crucial year bridging the transition onto the second decade of the CCM and building momentum on to the Second Review Process of the CCM that will take place under the able leadership of Switzerland in the year 2020,? he said.

SL still faces violent extremism: Minister Rajapakshe
	
Despite efforts taken by Sri Lanka, the country still faces emerging challenges such as violent extremism, migration, refugees, inequality and climate change, Higher Education and Cultural Affairs Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe said.
He expressed these views at the High Level Forum on the Follow up to the Declaration and Programme of Action on a Culture of Peace at UN Headquarters in New York on Wednesday.
Minister Rajapakshe said the impact of these challenges transcends national borders and required multilateral action to solve.
?These challenges need to be addressed in an integrated and holistic manner with the comprehensive participation of all states as well as multi stakeholders including civil society, media and the private sector,? he said.
He said it was vital to recognize that the most efficient way to prevent conflict is to support and sustain a strong functional multilateral system, where engagement, compromise and mutual respect for each other are key components.
He told the forum that Sri Lanka asserts and re-affirms its commitment to building a culture of peace, and recognizes the need for continuous support to further strengthen this global commitment.
In conclusion, he said the effort of promoting peace requires stronger joint efforts by the international community through partnerships and multi stakeholder support, especially at a time when fear and fear mongering, radicalization, terrorism and violent extremism threaten our societies.

Sri Lankan drug trafficking suspect nabbed in Bangkok
	
A Sri Lankan man wanted for drug trafficking in his home country has been arrested in Bangkok, four years after he first fled to Thailand, Bangkok Post reported.
Saliya Perera Wiwala Arachchige was apprehended in front of the Narathiwas Residence Hotel on Sathu Pradit Soi 19 in the Chong Nonsi area, Bangkok on Thursday. Officers asked him to produce his passport and found he was wanted on an Interpol red notice, Thai police said at a news conference on Saturday.
Officers from the Immigration Bureau, the Tourist Police Bureau, the Patrol and Special Operations Divsion and other agencies had been tracking the suspect?s whereabouts following a request by Sri Lankan authorities to country members of Interpol.
Interrogation revealed that Mr Arachchige had entered Thailand on a tourist visa in late 2013. He renewed his visa regularly until 2016 when he found that he was wanted on an Interpol red notice. At that point, he told investigators, he stopped renewing his visa for fear of being arrested.
According to Sri Lankan authorities, the suspect had fled the country four years ago. He has been accused of colluding with a major drug trafficking gang in his home country. The offences with which he is charged could lead to life imprisonment.

Sunday?s election  in Sweden and the immigration debate
	
The arrival in Sweden of 163,000 refugees, mainly Syrians, in 2015 -- making for a higher proportion of Sweden?s population than almost any other European country -- has been used by the far right to drum up broader fears about immigration. A recent spate of shootings, grenade attacks and burnt-out cars has made many Swedes feel afraid of what is going on. This is despite international surveys showing it?s the best nation at everything from economic competitiveness to doing good for humanity to achieving happiness.?
Sweden, a country of 10 million people, rebounded stronger from the financial crisis than any other big Western country, faster even than the US, and its economy has been solid ever since, benefiting from historically strong public finances and low government debt. The economy ploughs ahead, unemployment is low, having escaped relatively unscathed from the Great Recession.?
One would assume, since in democracies economic wellbeing is usually the top political issue, that in Sunday?s general election the incumbent party, the Social Democrats, the socialists, would win. Not so. They are polling poorly. So too is the Moderate Party, the leading party of the opposition. The only big party on the upswing is the Swedish Democrats, an anti-EU, anti-immigrant, party, that has its roots in a Nazi past. No matter that its main voting constituency -- the countryside and small towns -- house very few immigrants, their racism and parochialism could well upset Sweden?s long-time political balance and reasonableness.?
All sorts of wild ideas are now floating around about murder and rape. One is that because of immigrants the murder rate has gone up over the last two years. But a senior policeman said on television last week that in Malmo,? Sweden?s third largest city, where drug gangs shoot each other but almost never ordinary people, the murder rate had gone up by two the last year. According to the official Swedish Crime Survey, the number of ?confirmed cases of lethal violence? has fluctuated between 68 and 112 in the period of 2006?2015, with a decrease from 111 in 2007 to 68 in 2012, followed by an increase to 112 in 2015 and a decrease to 106 in 2016. Yet, when I asked a range of people in Malmo about the issue they only talk about the recent, highly unusual, drive-by killings near the town centre, of three men, involved, say the police, in drug trafficking. The press in Europe and the US also gave the impression that this was a regular happening.?
The number of convictions for rape has remained relatively unchanged since 2005, with approximately 190 convictions on average each year. But the Swedish press, in particular the tabloid press, which usually is by no means as sensationalist as its British and American counterparts, has inflamed the worry by reporting that most rapes are carried out by immigrants, but this is in cases when the woman doesn?t know the attacker. But that way of measuring it inflates the apparent percentage of immigrants. The new law that tightens up the definition of rape -- now probably the strictest in the world -- also has had the effect of raising the total number of reported rapes.?
What immigrant crime there is done by a very small minority. The vast majority of them are second generation immigrants, like the three young Somalis who after giving me a lift when the train had broken down robbed me last week (I had time to chat to them before they threatened to smash my face in if I didn?t hand over my money).?
The immigrant ?problem? highlights the errors made by the Swedish authorities when a wave of immigrants arrived a generation ago. They had the mistaken idea of multiculturalism -- just as in the UK, Germany and Denmark, but not in neighbouring Finland. It hasn?t work. It allowed immigrants to crowd together in neighbourhoods of their own kind. A young boy born into the ?ghetto? is inevitably alienated from Swedish society. His contact with normal, average, Sweden is minimal. Good teachers -- there are exceptions -- prefer not to teach in ghettos schools. Standards are low. When he grows up he will find that Swedish employers are prejudiced. Applicants for jobs with foreign names are often shunted aside. These issues combined have produced the problems of the second generation. Integration -- now belatedly recognised as necessary -- in which new immigrants are dispersed right round the country, avoids the formation of ghettos. The Syrian immigrants are being housed far and wide. They are also, unlike previous immigrants, being given an immediate right to residency so that they can look for jobs and not just be dependent on Sweden?s generous welfare system.?
Over the years, the mainstream politicians have not done a good job of educating the voters on all this, and their policies have often been the wrong ones. A good debate at election time should have been able to do something to enlighten people. I don?t see it has been done, at least enough.?

TOKYO AFP Sept7, 2018- Japanese rescue workers with bulldozers and sniffer dogs scrabbled through the mud Friday to find survivors from a landslide that buried houses after a powerful quake, as the death toll rose to 18.? ?
Around 22 people are still unaccounted for in the small northern countryside town of Atsuma, where a cluster of dwellings were wrecked when a hillside collapsed with the force of the 6.6-magnitude quake, causing deep brown scars in the landscape.? ?
?We?ve heard there are people still stuck under the mud, so we?ve been working around the clock but it?s been difficult to rescue them,? a Self-Defense Forces serviceman in Atsuma told public broadcaster NHK.? ?
?We will take measures to find them quickly.? An elderly woman in Atsuma told NHK: ?My relative is still buried under the mud and has not been found yet, so I couldn?t sleep at all last night. There were also several aftershocks so it was a restless night.? Around 1.6 million households in the sparsely populated northern island of Hokkaido were still without power after the quake damaged a thermal plant supplying electricity to the region.? ?

15% VAT on fabrics, timber will hurt these industries: Bandula
	
Joint opposition MP Bandula Gunawardane said yesterday the government had imposed a 15 per cent VAT on imported fabric and timber from August 16 this year and urged the government to reconsider it saying it was a huge blow to the related industries.
He told parliament that the previous regime had imposed a cess of Rs.100 on a kilogram of imported fabric used as raw material in garment factories but this government in addition had imposed a 15 per cent VAT.
"This has resulted in the industrialists now having to pay more than Rs.2 million more as tax to for a container of fabric thus inconveniencing small scale entrepreneurs," the MP said.
He said the move to impose a 15 per cent VAT on imported timber would also pose a threat to forest conservation as people would be compelled to fell more trees illegally.
In the absence of the subject minister, Chief Government Whip Gayantha Karunathilake said the matter was being discussed at the government MPs group meeting. (Ajith Siriwardana and Yohan Perera)

World Physical Therapy Day Staying mentally fit in a busy world
	
The World Physical Therapy Day, observed annually on September 8, gives the opportunity for physical therapists to raise awareness on their contribution to keep people well, mobile and independent. This year?s theme ?PHYSICAL THERAPY AND MENTAL HEALTH? demonstrates the role played by physical therapy and physical activity in mental health.
Age-standardised suicide rates: WHO?
There were close to 800,000 suicide deaths worldwide in 2016. This indicates an annual global age-standardised suicide rate of 10.5 per 100,000 people. The major differences between high-income countries and low and middle-income countries (LMICs) are that young adults and elderly women in LMICs have much higher suicide rates than their counterparts in high-income countries, while middle-aged men in high-income countries have much higher suicide rates than middle-aged men in LMICs. Some 800,000 people die from suicide each year (one death every 40 seconds). 2.8% was the median amount of the health budget allocated to mental health in 2011. At least 60 countries had less than 1 psychiatrist per 100,000 people in 2014.??
The World Confederation for Physical Therapy (WCPT) is the sole international voice for physical therapy, representing more than 350,000 physical therapists through its 106 member organisations. Sri? Lanka is also a member of the WCPT since 2003.?
In 1996, it designated September 8 as the World Physiotherapy Day.This is the date the WCPT was founded in 1951.The day marks the unity and solidarity of the global physiotherapy community. It is an opportunity to recognise the work physiotherapists do for their patients and the community at large.?
WCPT encourages physical therapists around the world to use its toolkit to convey these messages to the public and policymakers; the campaign is focused around the following key messages.?
?
Exercise as an evidence-based treatment for depression.?
	The role of physical therapists working with patients who may have mental health issues.?
	The benefits of physical activity in protecting against the emergence of depression.?
	How better outcomes are experienced when exercise is delivered by a qualified healthcare professional, such as a physical therapist.?
	How people with mental health issues are more at risk of having poor physical health.?
These messages are important not just to encourage health and activity in populations, but can help demonstrate how physical therapists keep people moving through interventions which maximise strength and mobility. Through advice and exercise programmes, physical therapists support people of all ages to achieve activity goals.?
Since 2003, we commemorated the World Physical Therapy Day with various programmes. Using World Physiotherapy Day as a focus, this year too, the Chartered Society of Physiotherapy Sri Lanka (CSPSL) aims at organising several programmes to promote the profession among the nation and advance the use of profession by public. However, we have found out that a majority aren?t aware of this subject, which is why we have decided to hold public awareness programmes on the physiotherapy profession.
?Chartered Society of Physiotherapy?
(Sri? Lanka)
To mark the World Physical Therapy Day, the Chartered Society of Physiotherapy (Sri Lanka) conducted a series of events. The objective of these programmes was to enhance awareness among the public about prevention and pre- and post-management of physical fitness when dealing with diseases, injuries and complications, assuring the wellbeing of life.?
The programmes consisted of five free physiotherapy clinics, four public awareness workshops and two sport injury management workshops. More than a thousand individuals including patients benefitted from these programmes. Also, wide media coverage was given. This included twelve?television interviews.? ?
With the guidance and contribution of 22 physiotherapists representing CSPSL, the final programme was held on September 7 in Thelkumuduwala, a rural village in Sri? Lanka. Free clinical and awareness events were organised, demonstrating the sense of value and importance of physical therapy.?
Physio Life Care? (Sri Lanka)?
To mark the World Physiotherapy Day, Physio Life Care (Sri? Lanka) conducted a series of events. They focused on this year?s ?Physical Activity for Life? message and raised public awareness on the importance of physical fitness. Two free physiotherapy clinics were carried out, along with fifteen exercise workshops, three public awareness workshops and five sport injury management workshops serving more than ten thousand individuals including patients. This series included coverage on six television channels.?
The final programme was held on September 6 in Pannala, offering free exercise workshops and awareness events, as well as a television programme on ITN.?
?
Some 800,000 people die from suicide each year (one death every 40 seconds). 2.8% was the median amount of the health budget allocated to mental health in 2011. At least 60 countries had less than 1 psychiatrist per 100,000 people in 2014
Physiotherapy Students? Welfare Society
An inter-school quiz competition was organised to celebrate the World Physical Therapy Day on September 8. It was organised by the Physiotherapy Students? Welfare Society, Department of Allied Health Sciences, ColomboUniversity Medicine Faculty.?
To raise public awareness on the subject matter, the World Physical Therapy Day should be mentioned in documents such as calendars, diaries and?
year planners.?
