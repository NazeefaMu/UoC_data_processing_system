Evelyn abeywickrama udawatte
	
A grateful gathering paid their last respects to Mrs Evelyn Abeywickrama Udawatte at Kanatte on 16th April 2018. She was a vibrantly pretty elegant lady and an outstanding personality resident in Bullers Lane for very many decades.
She was the second daughter of the legendary late Hon Simon Abeywickrama who was a Member of the Legislative Council, State Council and the first Parliament as Parliamentary Secretary of colonial Ceylon and the Chairman of the Dehiwela - Mt Lavinia Urban Development Council in the 1940s simultaneously, having won the Council election admirably in the constituency as well . His record majority victories in the Baddegama electorate was also outstanding in the 1930s and40s. Evelyn portrayed her legendary fathers leadership command and qualities.
She lost her illustrious father when he was just 49 years of age and she was in her late teens. She married genial Don Robert Udawatte a well endowed proprietory planter and a very hospitable gentleman, who died when he was quite young. Evelyn managed the estates, domestic and family matters with distinction. Her son Hiranya in USA and family, daughter Gayani who were very near and dear to her could be justifiably proud of their ancestry, their father and their mother who lived to be 91 years. Her sister was late Mrs Manel Hettiarachchi and her brothers were late Hamilton, Felix, Rajah and SD. Her younger sister Astrid is now their only surviving family member.

She lost her illustrious father when he was just 49 years of age and she was in her late teens.
She married genial Don Robert Udawatte a well endowed proprietory planter and a very hospitable gentleman, who died when he was quite young.
Evelyn managed the estates, domestic and family matters with distinction. ...
Evelyn was very helpful and generous to the poor, her fathers constituents, friends and relatives especially in need, With her late fathers respect and acceptability enshrined, she held the great political divide of Sri Lanka with equal ease and distinction, strengthening her family friendships with them built solidly from her childhood. She was a social elite, outspoken and quite at home for many decades on equal par with the political leaders of the country, as most of them were her fathers parliamentary contemporaries or dear family friends thereafter. Though she did not need their patronage personally, I am well aware that she was able to help many in need, who could otherwise never have come close to the powers that be, for justified priority assistance.
It is futile to elaborate on quality vintage Champagne as their bouquets are self-explanatory. Evelyn lived a life generously helping all those who came to her for assistance and need. She will be long remembered with undying love, thanks, affection and heartfelt gratitude, in prayers and beyond, by so many who benefited immensely from her unfailing assistance. She touched hearts genuinely.
Many will miss her benevolence, presence in the hour of need and generosity without any prejudice to all walks of life - May she attain Nibbana.

Everyone is scared of Gota  Ranjan
	
Everyone will fear former Defence Secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa if he comes to power, Deputy Minister Ranjan Ramanayake said yesterday.
Ramanayake came out with this sentiment in response to a statement made by Minister Mangala Samaraweera that he fear's former Defence Secretary.
"Won't all of us run away if we find out that there is a person here with a bomb Arent you afraid of Mahasona," he asked journalists.
Quoting former Minister Mervyn Silva, Ramanayake said the former had publicly stated that Mr. Rajapaksa was behind the white van drama during the previous regime. Also he recalled that Mr. Rajapaksa himself had publically stated several years ago that he would hang Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka. He said it is obvious that many become scared of former Defence Secretary when one considers the given circumstance.(Yohan Perera)

Ireland votes in historic abortion referendum
	

DUBLIN AFP May25, 2018 
Irish voters headed to the polls on Friday to vote in a landmark referendum on whether the traditionally Catholic country should liberalise some of the strictest abortion laws in Europe. 
The campaign has dominated public debate in Ireland over recent months and has forced its nearly 3.5 million voters to decide if the constitutional ban on abortion should stay or go. 
Ireland was traditionally one of the most religious countries in Europe. However, the Catholic Churchs influence has waned in recent years following a series of child sex abuse scandals.

JVPs 20th Amendment; a test for major parties
	
In significant move, the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) leader Anura Kumara Dissanayaka, in parliament yesterday handed over a private members bill or the 20th Amendment calling for the complete abolition of the 40 year executive presidential system. This system has been widely criticised by almost all parties but no one really got down to abolishing it due to many wide ranging reasons.
In July 1977, when the United National Partys (UNPs) then leader J.R Jayewardene won an unprecedented 5/6 majority in parliament, it possibly may have given him ideas of exercising absolute power and keeping his party in power for decades unlike the long drawn Constitutional Assemblies which we see even now Mr. Jayewardene - obviously with the help of his eminent lawyer- brother H. W Jayewardene, worked out an executive presidential system within eight months. On February 04, 1978 he was sworn in as Sri Lankas first Executive President with virtually unlimited political powers and without the checks and balances we see in other countries. In Sri Lanka the Executive Presidential system had its positives as well negatives.
Many see the necessity of a strong executive arm to carry out large scale development measures as undertaken during the terms of Presidents J.R. Jayewardene, Ranasinghe Premadasa and Mahinda Rajapaksa. They argue that such decisive implementation of development projects would not have been possible if not for the Executive Presidency. The same is seen with regard to the ending of the war. Among the widely seen political abuses from 1978 to 1988 was the 1982 Referendum which, most analysts believed was legal but illegitimate though Mr Jayewardene won a 50.1 majority in the controversial Referendum it was twisted and turned into a 5/6th majority in parliament.
Many analysts believe, this move drove the JVP out of main stream politics into which Mr Jayewardene himself had brought the party after the former Sirimavo Bandaranaike government appointed a wide - powered Criminal Justice Commission (CJC) which sent most JVP leaders to jail. The move also is believed to have been one of the main causes of July 1993 racial riots which was one of the biggest black marks in Sri Lankas history and regard the devastating 26  year ethnic war. Mr Jayewardene also virtually got rid of the opposition with a Special Presidential Commission (SPC) stripping former Premier Sirimavo Bandaranaike and other leaders of their civic rights and introducing the Fifth Amendment which forced the then Opposition Leader Appahpillay and Amirthalingam other Tamil members to quit parliament.
The next President Ranasinghe Premadasa also manipulated the executive system especially by the manner in which he dealt with the impeachment motion introduced by UNP seniors Gamini Dissanayaka, Lalith Athulathmudali and others. In 1994, when Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga took over as SLFP leader, she promised the JVP, she would abolish the executive presidential system within 24 hours if she was elected president because she believed it was the biggest curse for the country. But she did not follow through with her promises. After Mrs Kumaratunga, President Rajapaksa also promised to abolish the executive presidency but in 2010 he did just the opposite by enforcing the 18th Amendment which gave him the power to be president for life with absolute authority. In the campaign for the January 2015 presidential election, Maithripala Sirisena also promised to abolish it but had not fulfilled it so far.
The JVP ceremonially handed over the motion at 11.15 a.m yesterday, to Parliament Secretary General Dhammika Dasanayake in the presence of the Speaker Karu Jayasuriya. JVP frontliner MPs Suinil Handunnetti and Nihal Galappaththi were also present. It says the 14 page Bill may be sited as the 20th Amendment to the Constitution and essentially wants a ceremonial president elected by parliament on the advice of the Cabinet of Ministers.
However, detractors point out that at the time the Executive Presidency was introduced the 13th Amendment was not there and abolishing it at that time would not have been a concern. They point out that with the enactment of the 13th Amendment certain safeguards against secession are hinged on the Executive Presidency and therefore it is not advisable to abolish it while the 13th Amendment remains in place as it is. We hope all parties would consider what is best for the country and decide on this important issue in a balanced way.

Memoir to Grandpa - Lucian Peiris
	
He rose with the sun and spoke of the light,
The brave and the kind, he said, shone brightest at night
He conquered his fears while cool he kept his head,
For a home he kept, and to those in need, more than a pound of bread.
A braver man Ive not met, my grandfather himself.
These few lines cannot hold a lifetime of the goodness of one man as his.
Shakespeare, Thackeray, Haggard and Milton frequented his thoughts,
And the lines of Casablanca he recited so often like a song.
Not that he became a President nor worked to gain on anothers merit,

Thus, God blessed them both with lives blameless to the end. A love like no other, as people have seen, my grandma and he, Cherished and doted his first love and the mother of three.
Neither did he climb a stage to an award of someone elses sweat,
But he built a house of love and a smile on his wifes face he kept,
Thus, God blessed them both with lives blameless to the end.
A love like no other, as people have seen, my grandma and he,
Cherished and doted his first love and the mother of three.
To all those who knew, a model of honour was they,
Earned it fair by the sweat on their brow and goodness of heart.
People complaining how unfair it is with them, this life;
Tells he ought to knock-over anyone who crosses his ways.
But my Grandpa, a noble gentleman he was and wise,
My dear, two wrongs maketh not one right, he says.
Young men these days be like big wheels and slim fit!
But how about principles and morals they should have instead
My Grandpa, he lived a life filled with patience, wisdom and courage;

Tells he ought to knock-over anyone who crosses his ways. But my Grandpa, a noble gentleman he was and wise, My dear, two wrongs maketh not one right, he says. Young men these days be like big wheels and slim fit!

Be more like him, the world will be a better place.
This is in memory of Lucian Peiris, a great man and great-grandfather, who lived a fulfilled, blameless life and died a peaceful death on 23 May 2018 at the age of 98.
May his soul rest in peace in the arms of Jesus,
To be reunited with Lorainne Peiris, his beloved wife.
Until we all meet again and be happy like we once were!
Much love from, Nilufer Fernando (Daughter), Ranil Fernando (Son-in-Law), Romanthi Fernando (Grand-daughter) and Baby Shenaya (Great-Grand-Daughter)

Moon regroups after mediation failure
	
REUTERS, 25th MAY, 2018
U.S. President Donald Trumps decision to cancel next months summit with North Koreas Kim Jong Un came as a shock to South Korean officials, who only days ago were publicly predicting a 99.9 percent chance the meeting would proceed as scheduled.
Already on shaky ground amid stalled talks with North Korea, South Koreas ability to fulfil its self-assigned role of mediator between Pyongyang and Washington suffered the biggest blow yet when Trump apparently failed to give his allies in Seoul a heads up about his announcement. The setback follows months of diplomatic progress that led to a historic summit between Kim and South Korean President Moon Jae-in in April. Some experts said the cancelled meeting might add to scepticism in Washington that Moon might have misled Trump on North Koreas willingness to abandon its nuclear weapons programme, although U.S. officials have held at least two face-to-face meetings with Kim in recent weeks. Coming just a day after Moon returned from a trip to Washington to convince Trump to proceed with the summit, the about-face also signaled friction between the old allies over how to deal with a nuclear-armed North Korea.
Pictures released by South Koreas presidential Blue House showed a glum faced Moon in an emergency meeting with security advisers near midnight to review Trumps letter to Kim cancelling the summit.

Moratuwa Uni. starts  Aviation Engineering Dept.
	
Flying in the sky was a big dream of humans throughout the globe in the past and different nations tried in several ways to achieve the success but failed.
According to the legend of Ravana Dandumoneraya might be the worlds first aeroplane which transported people, thousands of years before Wright brothers invention. Therefore, we had a great history in constructing aeroplanes. With the growing trend of searching of Ravana legend among public research, if we will be able to prove the history, we can claim that we are the pioneers of the aeronautical field.
A long time after Ravana era, past 2-3 decades, there was an isolated effort of making aeroplanes in Sri Lanka and most of these were confined to research level.
In addition, there have been few aviation schools dedicated to aircraft maintenance courses. The Aeronautical Engineering is growing in-line with the countrys expanding air transport sector, as well as the increase in industry-related professionals.

A long time after Ravana era, past 2-3 decades, there was an isolated effort of making aeroplanes in Sri Lanka and most of these were confined to research level
Amongst all the courses in engineering, aeronautical engineering is a niche field and is only available in a few reputed
universities in the world. As a result of high demand for aeronautical engineering courses, for the first time in the state university sector, the Department of Mechanical Engineering of the University of Moratuwa added Aviation to the B.Sc. Engineering degree programme. Our Aeronautical Engineering Stream provides a solid foundation in mechanical engineering, leading to specialisation in aeronautical engineering. Aeronautical Engineering is a branch of aerospace engineering that deals with the study and creation of advanced technologies in the field of aviation, defence system,
and space technology. This course prepares you for designing, development, testing, maintenance and operation of commercial aeroplanes, military aircraft and their components. Although aeronautical engineers generally dont fly aircraft, they certainly have a huge contribution towards the field of aviation.
This course not only produced young aeronautical engineers to serve the country but also show their colours internationally gaining pride to the country. At present, the first batch of ten undergraduate students will participate in international aeronautical competitions in the UK showing that their knowledge and skills are hands in hand with other international graduates.
As a result of high demand for aeronautical engineering courses, the Department of Mechanical Engineering of the University of Moratuwa added Aviation to the B.Sc. Engineering degree programme
Aeronautical engineering has become a highly paid and prestigious career option. Although the salary of most aeronautical engineers depends on their academic excellence and individual skills, the average beginners pay in this field is much higher than in other engineering fields.
There is a huge need for aeronautical engineers in airlines, aircraft manufacturing units, aero engine production plants and design development programmes for the aviation industry. In fact, there are immense opportunities for those who wish to work abroad.
Moreover, we hope to get the knowledge and practical skills from world-recognized experts in aeronautical industries such as Airbus, Boeing and other aeronautical related industry, with an aim of manufacture aeroplanes within in Sri Lanka in near future.
Currently, we are in close collaboration with Sri Lankan Air Force, Sri Lankan Airlines and other aeronautical related industries to fulfil above aim. The University of Moratuwa has already established a research centre in Homagama and this centre caters and provides facilities and experts to make true of this. Other University students, especially who are interested in aeronautical fields, especially post-graduate level, can also join us.
Manufacturing our own aircraft is no longer a dream. At present Sri Lanka is already in the process of making a simultaneous improvement on the following aspects such as, Development of aviation infrastructure, Airline fleet modernization and expansion, improving local and international aviation affairs and Expanding and improving aviation related functions and activities.

No Govt. funds used to build 'Seemamalakaya': Champika
	
Megapolis Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka said yesterday no government funds were used to build the "Seemamalakaya" in the Diyawanna Oya near the Parliament Road as alleged by joint opposition MP Gamini Lokuge in parliament.
He told parliament that the MP had alleged on Thursday that the "Seemamalakaya" which was built at the entrance to parliament, was of poor quality and had been damaged due to the recent rains.
The minister said it was not a "Seemamalakaya" but a building constructed by a private company to facilitate Buddhist monks and those in the area to engage in religious activities such as meditation and Buddhist sermons.
"The said private company had planned it to be a floating structure, but due to a defect in a pontoon used for that purpose, it did not turn out to be a success," the minister said and added that the company which did the construction work was instructed to look into what went wrong; was it a defect in the designing or construction or an act of sabotage.
He said the company had assured it would rectify the problem within a short time. (Ajith Siriwardana and Yohan Perera)

Professor Chandra L. Jayasuriya The Heart and Soul of our Family
	
The ones that love us never really leave us. They can always be found in our hearts
A fact of life we often tend to forget when growing up, is that people we love are also growing older. 
The sad reality of this dawned on me on the 2nd of May 2018, when at the age of 79, my grandmother - Professor Chandra Jayasuriya, passed away. 
My grandmother was a constant presence in my life from my formative years, and try as I may, this is but a vain attempt to do justice in a few words for what she meant to me.

A product of Southlands College, Galle and Visakha Vidyalaya, Colombo, Aachchi was both hardworking and smart, an ideal recipe for success. 
She obtained a Bachelor of Arts Degree from the University of Peradeniya and went on to do her Post Graduate Studies in Statistics at the University of South Carolina, USA. After returning to the island, she initially lectured at the University of Peradeniya, before moving to the Faculty of Education, University of Colombo. 
She lectured there for over 30 years, rising to the level of a Professor and later being appointed the Dean of the Faculty. She was a knowledgeable teacher and an inspiration to her students. Aachchi had a keenness for acquiring knowledge, a quality she inculcated in her two daughters whom she brought up to be educated women.  Apart from her career, Aachchis interests were varied. She was a voracious reader, even going on to pen a few books of her own. 
She also loved to sew, and I have many fond memories of her painstakingly adjusting my clothes so they would fit the way I wanted. Being the versatile person she was, she also prepared delicious meals for us on a regular basis. 

Her immense love for me was evident, in what she did for me. Be it buying me gifts for no apparent reason, never forgetting to send me a birthday card or once keeping vigil by my hospital bed when I was sick.
Aachchi, as the eldest in a large family was the respected matriarch, a role she thrived in, offering words of advice or support in any way she could, when needed. She was a compassionate person, and her magnanimity often extended to the less-fortunate. The door of Aachchis home was literally open to her many friends and relations to walk in and have a quiet chat whilst enjoying her hospitality. She was forthright in what she said and did, yet never caused offense. She was a doting grandmother to both me and my cousin brother, forever looking out for us, understanding, supportive of our dreams and encouraging us to work hard. She would not only celebrate our achievements but also spur us on when we fell short. 
Her immense love for me was evident, in what she did for me. Be it buying me gifts for no apparent reason, never forgetting to send me a birthday card or once keeping vigil by my hospital bed when I was sick.
She was in many ways, the heart and soul of our family, and were all a great deal poorer without her. I feel blessed to have had so many opportunities to talk to Aachchi in the last few months, but there are still things I wish Id had the chance to say. She was one of my biggest role models and I hope that I grow up to be a woman half as successful and kind as she was. 
We love you Aachchi. You will forever be missed.

Seasonal influenza claims nine lives
	
While admitting that the seasonal influenza spreading in the Southern Province had caused the deaths of nine individuals last month, Chief Epidemiologist Dr. Anil Dissanayake yesterday said the number of admissions to hospitals had considerably reduced this week.
Dr. Dissanayake told Daily Mirror that all nine deceased were infants and four of them had already been suffering from chronic diseases including heart disease. He also said the other infants who had died were those who were continuously getting treated for some health issue.
More than 90 deaths were reported in 2017 due to this seasonal influenza which spread all across the country unlike in 2018. The seasonal influenza only spread in the Southern Province this year. However, there are possibilities of the influenza spread to the other areas also if preventive measures are not taken, he said.
He said accordingly the spread of this disease had been brought under control and added that the damage it had caused was relatively low in comparison to last year.
He also said the Epidemiology Unit and the all other health authorities were on high alert and had taken all possible steps to mitigate the prevailing situation. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)

Section of 'Seemamalakaya' on Diyawanna has sunk
	
One side of the floating structure built by a private construction company on the Diyawanna Oya for use as a 'Seemamalakaya' by the Amarapura Maha Sangha Sabha, has partially sunk because of a snag in the construction, Project Director and Senior Engineer Shameera Jayawardane said yesterday.
The public-funded structure, which is mid way in the construction process is a part of the company's Corporate Social Responsibility projects and is to be gifted to the Amarapura Maha Sangha Sabah when the construction work was completed next month.
"A mishap during the construction has resulted in the structure sinking. It may have been a fault in one of the four barges which keep the structure afloat.
Coincidentally, the Amarapura Maha Sangha Sabah is also constructing its new headquarters close to the Lake at Kimbulawala for use as a meditation and rest centre.
The barges are first filled with water and sunk before construction. The water is later pumped out after construction is complete. The heavy rains must have damaged one of the barges, Mr. Jayawardene said and added that it was only during the final stages of construction that problems had surfaced.
It all went according to plan until we pulled up the structure to the surface. Unfortunately one barge did not come up as planned because of the mud from a nearby field. We cannot repair it at the moment as the water level is too high and the weather is still bad, he said.
Sri Lanka Land Reclamation & Development Corporation (SLLRDC) Chairman Roshan Gunawardane confirmed that SLLRDC did not hold any responsibility for the project or the structure, once construction was complete.
Meanwhile, Megapolis and Western Development Minister Champika Ranawaka said the construction work was handled by Sanken Construction (Pvt) Ltd and that several individuals were using this matter to sling mud at him.
It is a CSR project and nothing to do with the UDA, SLLRDC or the Megapolis Ministry, he said.
However, Urban Development Authority (UDA) Chairman Jagath Munasinghe said the National Physical Planning Department (NPPD) had provided its architectural services for the 4,000 square foot structure which could hold a maximum of 200 individuals.
The construction of the structure was entirely conducted by the engineers and employees of the private company, Mr. Munasinghe said. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

Two unidentified men walked into a restaurant on Thursday in the Canadian city of Mississauga and set off a bomb, wounding more than a dozen people, and then fleeing, local police said.
The blast went off in the Bombay Bhel restaurant at about 10:30 p.m local time. Fifteen people were taken to hospital, three of them with critical injuries, the Peel Regional Paramedic Service said in a Tweet.
The two male suspects fled after detonating their improvised explosive device, Peel Regional Police said in a Tweet. No one has claimed responsibility, and the motive for the attack was not known.
Police posted a photograph on Twitter showing two people with dark zip-up hoodies walking into an establishment. One appeared to be carrying an object.
Peel Police said one suspect was in his mid-20s, stocky, and wore dark blue jeans and a dark zip-up hoody pulled over his head, with black cloth covering his face. The second was thin, and wore faded blue jeans, a gray t-shirt and a dark zip-up hoody over his head, also with his face covered.

Viyath Maga Convention:  Intellectualism  vs Intellect A review of Gotabhaya  Rajapaksas Viyath Mag
	
The of 16th May carried the Report of the Annual Convention of the Viyath Maga written by Lahiru Pothmulla, under the heading Sri Lanka should seize the opportunity , in the context of the shift of global economic centre to Asia.
One may think the title Intellectualism and Intellect paradoxical.
The truth appears paradoxical. I think an explanation is necessary, here.
Intellectualism is accumulating and storing knowledge in the mind; Whereas, Intellect is a tool of the mind. It is used as a faculty to acquire knowledge. Intellectualism and Intellect are two different things.
Yet, they are connected to each other. Intellectualism is, not the Intellect; Nor, the Intellect is intellectualism. Intellect is thinking discriminately. It is the mental capacity to discern the difference between seemingly similar things, but really dissimilar.
In Hindu Vedantic philosophy it is called Viveka in Sanskrit.
Coming to the Viyath Maga Convention is a precursory Propaganda Seminar to boost the image of its Chairman, Gotabhaya Rajapaksa (GR) and lend support for his prospective candidature for the forthcoming Presidential elections scheduledfor 2019.
The theme of the Convention was An Intellectually Inspired Sri Lanka. Quite fittingly, GR had marshalled half a dozen Resource Persons of Intellectual eminence, both expatriates and locals, to justify the said theme.
The notable inclusion of a Tamil and a Muslim in the panel of speakers is deliberately intentional, to suggest that his prospective Presidency will be an inclusive one, recognizing the pluralism of the Sri Lankan polity, to woo the minorities.
The Sri Lankan expatriates, of course would have been delighted to be cajoled by the offer of free air ticket, food and lodging, to come on a holiday to the mother country. Further, gracing the Convention is an implied support for GRs Presidential bid and to give credence to the slogan An Intellectually inspired Sri Lanka, would be the mark of his Presidential regime, if elected.
Moreover, these speakers of the intellectual calibre can be rest assured, they will be in the waiting list for rewards in a prospective GR regime.
Moving away from my preliminary observations, I would critically examine the views expressed by the resource persons, confining to the Media Report only and not beyond. In doing so, I disclaim being an intellectual, armed with a PhD prefix to my name. I am just a commoner with acommonsense perception.

Intellectually Inspired Sri Lanka

What we see in reality is that, when Intellectuals/l professionals formulate progressive solutions to the countrys problems, the ignorant, dark forces of Sinhala Buddhist Inspiration, Sangha Nikayas and other extremist entities, scuttle them
The above slogan suggests that the GR regime would be one comprising, the educated, intellectuals, Professionals, Managerial Experts ,and Technocrats and, his policies and actions will be intellectually inspired. Is this blind optimism, pragmatic, considering the Sri Lankan reality I say no, for following reasons:

(a) First and foremost, to be intellectually inspired, the countrys Legislature or the Parliament must consist of intellectually inspired persons. The reality is, leave aside intellectuality, majority of the Members of Parliament, does not even have the basic secondary level educational qualification of an OL or AL. What intellectual inspiration can be drawn and harnessed from such persons The Government is the Driving Engine of the country. But it is not driven by intellectual inspiration, but by Emotional Inspirations of Religious/Racist kind.
(b) As a first step, to draw intellectual inspiration, those contesting elections to be chosen as Members of Parliament, should have a mandatory requirement of a minimum educational qualification of a University Degree or equivalent professional qualification from a recognized Institute.
(c) Intellectualism demands the principle of equity. People and the Rulers of the country must have a secular outlook and attitude, particularly in a multi-cultural polity. Having an emotional, religious provision in the Constitution to cater to the religious inspiration of one religion of the majority, is contradictory to the proclaimed intellectually inspired Sri Lanka. Intellectual inspiration can flow, only from Secular Inspiration.
Therefore, a declaratory provision in the Constitution, making Sri Lanka a Secular State is a sine qua non for the realization of the slogan an Intellectually Inspired Sri Lanka.
(d) Unless and until the masses of the people of the country shed their ignorance by a reasonable standard of education and their racial-religious orientation, the hope of having an Intellectually Inspired Sri Lanka is only a dead hope.
(e) On the contrary, what we see in reality is that, when Intellectuals/l professionals formulate progressive solutions to the countrys problems, the ignorant, dark forces of Sinhala Buddhist Inspiration, Sangha Nikayas and other extremist entities, scuttle them. Some examples are, Trade Agreements with other countries, Access to higher education through Private Institutions, Private Medical College, framing a new Constitution to solve the National Question.
(f) Whichever Government comes to power, it appoints, not professionals and Intellectuals of proven ability and capacity, but Politically Inspired family members, sycophants, to top local and diplomatic positions.
(g) Mere lip service to Intellectualism, Professionalism and Technocratism is of no use, unless we change the mindset of individuals and extremist groups, from their Sinhala Buddhist inspirational thinking to secularist, modernistic thinking, based on Intellectual Inspiration.
The shift of the economic centre of gravity to the Asian Region The shift of the centre of economic gravity to the Asian Region, with the expanding economies of China, India and the Far East countries, is a current phenomenon that is self-evident, which even a Grade 10 student knows.
But are we gearing our economy to face this economic onslaught
On the contrary, the Sri Lankan Politicians of various hues and even irrelevant professional bodies like the GMOA, wants Sri Lanka to be a closed economy and an insular one.
In the face of the Global shift to the Asian Continent, Sri Lanka should be more outward looking and not inwards. The country should interact with the countries of the Asian Region, in concrete terms, like Free Trade Agreements, cross-border industrialization and market penetration etc. The incumbent Government, particularly the Prime Minister, Ranil Wickremesinghe is far-sighed and cognizant of Asian Regions rise and taking measures to integrate with the Asian Regional countries like India, Singapore, China, Malaysia etc. But our local Intellectuals and Professional Bodies, like GMOA, under the Sinhala Buddhist Inspiration, is running counter to that effort. Isnt this a case of not seizing the opportunity in the face of the Asian ascendancy
I wish to comment on some views expressed by the panel of speakers, which are not in line with the discipline of reasoning and discriminative thinking associated with the Intellect.
This indiscriminating and false reasoning is not the mark of an Intellect. To say in the terminology of argument, it is an analogical fallacy
	Intellectual inspiration can flow, only from Secular Inspiration.

Dr Rohan Gunaratnes (RG) views
Dr RG states that Sri Lanka should play a Neutral Role in world Geo-Politics.
Since UN is relocating its relevant Institutional arm to African Region, due to its greater Project activities there, he opines that we should invite the UN to relocate its Offices to Sri Lanka by offering them a plot of land.
In such a neutral role, Sri Lanka could become the Asian Geneva. We, as a nation is, habituated to such grandiose notions of becoming an International Hub for many things.
The last Regime, self-arrogated to itself the label Miracle of Asia, even before becoming an economic miracle. Before playing a neutral role in world geopolitics, the Sri Lankan State should play a neutral role in domestic affairs first, rather than playing a partial Sinhala Buddhist majoritarian role. Taking a clue from Dr RG, I suggest, it would be more appropriate, if Sri Lanka invites the UNHRC to relocate in Sri Lanka, because it has more work to do here, in the face of Human Rights violations taken place, like disappearances of persons, abductions, Tortures and State complicit murders.
Views expressed by Dr RG are wanting in reasoning and discriminatory discipline of the intellect. Dr RG is reported to have said that Sri Lankas development in 1950s, 60s, 70s was better than even Japan, Korea, Singapore and Taiwan.
However, he has not supported this view by comparative statistical data like GDP, Per Capita Income, Industrial Output, human welfare Index.
However, Sri Lankan prosperity and the standard of Administration and Management of the economy was a legacy, and a spillover effect of the British rule, and not due to our indigenous efforts. With the nativisation of the rule of the country, particularly after 1956, the decline in the rule of the country began.
The British left us a thriving economy and the tradition of a sound Civil Service. By the nationalization of the Plantation Industry, and other successful Private Sector Industries, the degradation of the economy was achieved. Even today, we have not produced an Industry to manufacture a motor vehicle, motor cycle, nay even a pedal bicycle.
The views of the Intellectual Dr Bandula Wijeratne Salient views of Dr BW are:
(a) Team work key to innovation and Research
(b) Sri Lanka lack Team Work; Promotes individuality
(c) Current Education system discourages teamwork
(d) The mindset of innovation should be taught at school stage and not after graduating from the University.
(e) Comparison of the education system of the US and Sri Lanka.
Let me examine the above propositions more closely and discriminately. Of course, Team Work is necessary for Innovative Research and Development. It is not that Sri Lanka lacks team work. It is really another way around. Sri Lanka lacks Innovative Research and Development for team work.
We have several Research Institutes like CISIR, TRI, RRI, ARI and MRI etc. But what significant innovative Research and Development have been done by them These are non-dynamic, complacent, Research Institutes, doing the administrative function of issuing a certification of quality standards etc.
Have they found new techniques and methods to raise productivity and yield rates Have they discovered a new range of Product lines, in Industry and/or Agriculture, Medicine
The aim of all education and learning is to promote individual excellence and not Group excellence. The aim and purpose of Primary and Secondary education are not to produce innovative students but to mould them and impart knowledge. Innovative ideas, creativity, inventiveness are pursuits to be followed at a higher stage of learning with the evolution of maturity. The lopsided education Dr.BW proposes, is like asking to swim before walking.
In support of his thesis, he cites the ludicrous example of the Cricketer Kumar Sangagkara, saying that he became a master in his field of cricket, because he practised cricket in his school stage. Dr BW poses the question imagine what would have happened, if Kumar Sangagkkara or any other star cricketer, practised cricket after they graduated from school or University.
This indiscriminating and false reasoning is not the mark of an Intellect. To say in the terminology of argument, it is an analogical fallacy. Dr BW fails to discriminate between the mental and the physical. Mental activity of learning is not a physical activity. The practice of sport of any kind can be and would be an advantage if started young.
Could one practise learning This is practical only in manual or vocational training. For example could a student of learning, practice Medicine at the school stage in his career
Dr BW states that Sri Lankan education was introduced by the British and does not give room for innovation.
He fails to realize that he himself is a product of this same education system. He is not less innovative, in spite of this. He has earned a Doctorate, nevertheless. Dr BW also states that education system in the US is very broad. It is the most fundamental reason why the US is worlds leader in Innovation. Further states that even students aged 10-12 come up with most practical ideas, which can be developed into Projects. The US is a materialistic civilization. It is this preoccupation with the material in the US education system that has produced material prosperity and spiritual poverty. From the young age, Americans start making and innovating material objects rather than human development. Simply stated the US worships matter over the spirit. No wonder there is a high percentage of social misfits in America.
Mano Sekeram (MS) CEO 99X Technologies/Chairman, Lanka Angel Network

Unless and until the masses of the people of the country shed their ignorance by reasonable standard of education and their racial-religious orientation, the hope of having an Intellectually Inspired Sri Lanka is only a dead hope
As an Intellectual in the IT field, his focus is on:
(a) Upgrading Sri Lankas Digital Infrastructure
(b) Human Capital Development
Both these are vital for the economic development of the country. How can Human Capital be expanded when narrow-minded thinking prevails in Professional bodies like GMOA, Inter-University Students Federation, who wants to limit, restrict Human Capital expansion, by objecting to Private Medical Colleges, Private Higher Education Institutes/Colleges/Universities. Mr.MS laments that out of 200000 students who qualify, only 30000 enter Universities. Hence, there is a wide miss-match between the demand for higher education and available infrastructure. The answer is more and more State or Private Universities. But the Government yields to these obscurantist elements with vested interests, to restrict than expand Human Capital, under their cock and bull story of endangering free-education and lowering of examination standards, example Clinical standards of Doctors.
Dr NalakaGodahevas views
Dr NG compares the Private Industrial Corporations like Samsung Corporation and Service Providers like Facebook, in terms of Turnover, Growth Rates and Assets with the economy of Sri Lanka. Is this Intellectual discriminate thinking Isnt this comparison preposterous and an analogical fallacy
After all, Sri Lanka is not a Business Corporation producing only industrial goods. Like any country, its economy is a multi-faceted amalgam of Industry, Agriculture, Fisheries, Services, Exports of Gems, commercial crops of Tea, Rubber, Desiccated coconuts, Cardamom, Cinnamon, Tourism and a host of numerous other products. All these are subject to fluctuations in world prices and vagaries of climate, like droughts and floods. An Industrial Corporation producing one or more lines of industrial goods is not subject to variables mentioned above, like a countrys economy.
Mr ErandaGiniges views
I have not much to comment on his views, limited to the concept of development. From what is reported, these are just generalizations. He speaks of a Traditional method of development, which is old destructive and unproductive development and we should start our own development.
He has left unsaid what is traditional development and what is our own development. He has not stated in what manner the traditional development is destructive and unproductive. Any development will have some productive results; Otherwise, why call it development

We want to walk hand-in-hand with SL: Keshap
	
Outgoing US Ambassador Atul Keshap has said his country wants to walk hand-in-hand with all Sri Lankans to see the dream of a brighter future coming true.
As you look at the UN process, as you look at the American partnership, we want to walk with Sri Lanka hand-in-hand, with all of the people of Sri Lanka, to see that there is a brighter future," Ambassador Keshup said in an interview with TV Derana.
"The reconciliation process in the country should be Sri Lankan-led and a Sri Lankan-driven process that would lead to healing and a brighter future," Mr. Keshap said.
He said he applaud the Sri Lankan Government for the leadership that they showed in 2015 and again in 2017 in joining hands with the US and with well-intending international partners including the UN, to co-sponsor a resolution that talked about the bright vision of the voters of the country for a reconciled, peaceful and happy Sri Lanka.
"We applaud it, we support it, we have invested heavily trying to see that our relationship expands. Because, we want Sri Lanka to succeed and the government is taking steps, there are certainly many more steps that need to be taken, but it should be a Sri Lankan led and a Sri Lankan driven process that I am confident would lead to healing and a brighter future, he said at the interview.
When asked about his views on repealing the Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA), the ambassador said, the PTA was something that not only the US but other like-minded partners and the Sri Lankan government, had committed to through the UN process.
We do think that as Sri Lanka gets into a post-war phase and while strengthening its democracy, it is up to Sri Lanka to move along these things that it is committed to do. We like to see more steps taken and we think as the Geneva Framework moves forward, not only would US walk in full partnership with the people of Sri Lanka, but we are certain as that happens, there will be a very important process of healing that will be good for the people and will take this country to a brighter future, he said.
The Ambassador said he was one of the people privileged to be present at the Independence Day celebrations in 2016 after his appointment as ambassador.
I saw grown-ups, weeping to see the national anthem sung not just in Sinhalese, but for the first time in Tamil as well at a state function, in almost fifty years. That is the power of reconciliation, that is the power of healing after so much trauma and tragedy. I look at the OMP, RTI all these initiatives to enhance democracy, to enhance transparency, to empower the citizen, to ensure the freedom of media and to ensure the rule of law. These things are important, he said.
Responding to divided opinions about the US within Sri Lanka, he said the US had a very positive relationship with Sri Lanka and continued to stick with that relationship.
We are setting up a programme that will ensure that the young people in this country are empowered to develop a brighter future through entrepreneurship. We are going to set up offices in Kandy, Hambantota and Jaffna for young people to get the tools they need to empower themselves and create new businesses. We just launched a daily programme to boost dairy production in the whole country. We have a programme to help rural economic growth and job growth all around the rural areas of this country.
"Our aim is very much at the grassroots, we believe in empowering people to help themselves and this builds on a strong legacy of aid that was in infrastructure, health care, irrigation and so many other places that have helped build the modern and relatively prosperous country of Sri Lanka today. We think very carefully about how we engage. We do it respectfully and with full collaboration and partnership with the government of Sri Lanka and the people of Sri Lanka. We are good friends, we don't ask for anything back, he said.
Commenting on the challenges faced by foreign investors when investing in Sri Lanka, the Ambassador said US companies bring world-class values of transparency, of ethics, of environmental responsibility, of managerial excellence, technological and design innovation.
Our companies are subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Our companies make sure that they do not engage in any untoward activity and when they look around the world with all of the money that they have to expand their operations to mutually profitable expansions, they look for business ecosystems that are high trust, very clear rules, quick arbitration and impartial arbitration of disputes that have a degree of stability, a degree of predictability, that have an ethical ecosystem, where there isnt any favouritism outside the deal. Because these scare our companies off, they go where they feel that there is a level and fair playing field where they can operate within the very strict parameters of ethics that are required of them by the American government, by their stake holders and the American public.
"When an American company settles into a country, they bring these high standards and they lift the standards of the entire economy. There are world class US companies here, and I like to see more of that happen, I would like to see those standards. More could be done in Sri Lanka. We like to see the government strengthening the rule of law, enhancing a level playing-field for business people, he said.
All we are asking for is a level playing field. We have been in the Indo-Pacific region for a long time. We believe in a free and open Indo-Pacific, we believe in a global operating system that is beneficial to all. I win you win, everybody wins. The US government, American tax payers, even the US navy and the sea lanes of the Indian Ocean are helping to ensure and open an operating system that is accessible. We believe in peaceful resolution of disputes, we believe in rule-based order. We believe in a bright future for all of humanity, based on all sharing the burden of sustaining this global operating system. If US companies can be a part of a fair and transparent system, they do very well, Ambassador Keshup said.

Wildlife vet officers withdraw from vulnerable tasks
	
The Wildlife veterinary officers have decided to withdraw from the duties vulnerable to dangers from yesterday afternoon in protest of the Wildlife Departments decision to suspend the service of a veterinary surgeon and two other employees on charges of shooting a bear, Union Secretary Dr. Nalaka Kasun Abeywardena said.
The wildlife employees said they had to shoot the bear to protect the life of a man when the bear was attacking him.
The union said it was very unreasonable to suspend the services of the wildlife officer without considering their repeated attempts to focus the attention of the authorities about the difficulties and danger they are exposed to and about the nonavailability of the medicines and other devices used to restrain the wild animals.
There legal provisions about the procedures to be taken in occasion of this nature but authorities have taken hasty decision to take disciplinary actions against the employees, according to the union.
Wildlife officers have decided to withdraw from services related to capture and sticking identification belt to the elephants,restraining and capturing of bears and leopards, Union Secretary Abeywardena said. (Kanchana Kumara Ariyadasa)

## Title: Bang, Bang to Trump

Bang, Bang to Trump
	
Can you smell the whiff of smoke You surely can. But the gunfire Not yet. But it must start soon if the battle has any chance of success.
President Donald Trump has to be faced down. Not only because of his sabotage of the Iran nuclear deal but also because of his attack on Europes export of steel and aluminium which breaks all the rules on tariffs set by the World Trade Organisation. This man should not be allowed to get away with his gross disturbance of the world political and economic order.
Donald Tusk, the President of the Council of the European Union, said boldly last week, Who needs enemies when you have friends like this Who indeed Trump is, as David Goodhart wrote in Foreign Affairs, a living fossil, the sort of ugly American common enough in earlier eras. Trump is leading America into a dark tunnel where there is no sunlight and no daylight at the end of it.
His unilateral ending of the Iran nuclear agreement could easily lead to war between Israel and Iran, between Iran and Saudi Arabia and even between the US and Iran. The Middle East, already devastated by wars that the US and the UK started, will become a moonscape of destruction. Iran, instead of being just an antagonist of the US will become an enemy, strong enough to give the US a large and regular dose of political and military pain.
Economically, Germany has the power to face down Trump, especially when supported by the rest of the EU. The US only buys 9% of Germans exports. The EU overwhelmingly trades with itself
Does America, even many of those who voted for Trump, want to confront Iran The polls say no by a good margin. For nearly 80 years America and Europe have for most of the time run in a three-legged race. This had disadvantages, but most of the two electorates have wanted it this way, and still do. Trump doesnt. His irrationality can only be explained by his determination to undo all the good things Barack Obama did.
This is not a good enough reason to break up a treaty that Europe, Russia and China so value. Europe must call a halt to this. Retaliation is the only way. Sanctions, the weapon that brought Iran and white South Africa to the negotiating table, must be introduced against the US.
Europe is both strong enough to do this and strong enough to go for the long haul. Europe has 500 million consumers compared with the USs 300 million. It will also have the quiet support of Russia and China.
Politically Europe is more than ready. Before Trump announced earlier this month that he was abrogating the Iran deal polls in Germany and France showed how popular Obama was and how unpopular is Trump. Days after Trumps election a survey found that 75% of the French held a negative opinion of him. The then president, Francois Hollande, said Trumps excesses made him want to throw up.
A survey reported that 92% of Germans disapprove of Trump According to a Pew survey 25% of Germans trust Putin compared with 11% who trust Trump.
Economically, Germany has the power to face down Trump, especially when supported by the rest of the EU. The US only buys 9% of Germans exports. The EU overwhelmingly trades with itself. On the other side of the coin German companies employ 700,000 people in the US.
Europes squeeze should probably begin with sport, just as President Jimmy Carter did at the time of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. The US withdrew its contingent from the Olympics in Moscow. It badly upset the American athletes who had trained for years. But it was broadly popular in America.
Sport boycotts quickly call the populaces attention. At least half of Americans have only a crude idea why the Iran nuclear agreement is so important. So to hit the US with a boycott of US tennis matches and American players in Europe will hurt. So it will with rowing at Henley and ice hockey in Sweden. It is likely that Russia, also a signatory of the Iran agreement, could be persuaded to ban the US from the football World Cup in Moscow next month.
Germany and other European investors in America should be made to withdraw some of their investments and lay off American workers (with good termination payments). New investment should be halted. European car, drug, machinery and high tech manufacturers should be given government direction and help to invest more in Canada, Japan, China, India, South East Asia, Africa and Latin America, all of which, apart from the last, have booming markets

European car, drug, machinery and high tech manufacturers should be given government direction and help to invest more in Canada, Japan, China, India, South East Asia, Africa and Latin America, all of which, apart from the last, have booming markets. The EU (and Russia) should rely more on themselves for rocket development and space exploration. Where possible trade with Iran should be sheltered from US sanctions.
The list can easily be made longer. I doubt if Trump will be able for long to resist the pressure to change his mind from an electorate already turning against him.
