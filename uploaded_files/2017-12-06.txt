A heart-stopping moment
	
A group of lions were jumping for joy after a young buck's attempt to leap over the pride ended miserably for the young dear. The charging buck came hurtling towards the group of lucky lions, who wasted no time in dragging the animal to the floor and sinking their teeth in. The buck can be seen struggling as the four lions hold down the animal, tearing it apart as they share the meal between them. The incident was witnessed in Nelspruit, South Africa. (Daily Mail)

A tall order by the ideal candidate
	
?
The JO is looking for a suitable candidate for City Mayor to be fielded on the Pohottuwa ticket at the coming local government polls.?
?
The former strongman leading the JO group had put in feelers to several former mayors in deference to the opinion of several party high-ups that one who had already gone through the mill would fill the bill better.?
In fact, the former strongman had sought the advice of a politico who had to quit this post quite recently about a candidate capable of giving a fight to Rose Madam to come from the Green party and the latter had recommended Omar K as a good match for the Green candidate.?
However, Omar K had reportedly replied that he was willing to run for city mayor only if the Pohottuwa becomes part and parcel of the Blue party before the filing of nominations.

Burning issues on GAS  tenders
	
Questions have been raised as to why the Ministry of Public Enterprise Development is silent over Litro Gas Lanka?s alleged failure to follow government procurement guidelines in the Liquid Petroleum Gas (LPG) purchase.??
The Technical Evaluation Committee [TEC] appointed by the Department of Public Finance and Treasury to evaluate the LPG purchase is now being questioned on how vital requirements seeking from the prospective bidders have been ignored in order to award the tender only to a selected bidder.??
Tenders were called from international bidders in May this year for the supply of 300, 000 MT of LPG to Litro Gas Lanka Limited for 2017/2018. The lowest bidder was M/s. Oman Trading International Ltd., which is a fully-owned subsidiary of the Government of Oman, and the second lowest bidder was M/s. Shell International Eastern Trading Company and the other selected bidders were M/s. Vitol Asia (Pvt) Ltd., M/s. BB Energy (Asia) Pvt Ltd., and M/s Maruti Energy DMCC.??
The methodology the TEC followed from the time the bids were opened has raised several questions on the sequence of events that took place.? ?
On what basis the TEC rank the bidders and brought Shell International as number one. We do not see any faults with the SCAPC members or with the Cabinet of Ministers but solely with the TEC
The Oman-based company?s price quote to supply LPG was US$ 48 per MT while Shell quoted US$ 49. In order to offer the tender to Shell International Eastern Trading - without informing the lowest bidder - the TEC had given Shell International another opportunity to negotiate their price which had led them to bring down by US $ 1.50 to US$ 47.50 per MT. However, the Oman Trading had never been asked to negotiate their price.??
Although Oman Trading complied with all the requirements Litro Gas has sought in their tender document, by letter dated July 31, 2017 Secretary Ministry of Public Enterprise Development Ravindra Hewavitharana had informed Oman Trading, Vitol Asia, BB Energy and Maruti Energy that the Standing Cabinet Appointed Procurement Committee (SCAPC) has recommended the award of the above tender to the (technically responsive bidder) Shell International Eastern Trading.??
The letter further states as thus, ?If there are any representations/ appeals to be made against the above determination, you are kindly advised to make them in writing to the Chairman Procurement Appeal Board, the Presidential Secretariat Colombo 1, with a copy to the Secretary, Ministry of Public Enterprise Development along with all the materials required to support your appeal. This intimation is issued to you in terms of Sections 8.3 of the Government Procurement Guidelines 2006?.? ?
?According to Oman Trading, they were surprised when they received the letter as they were never informed that their application was rejected though they were the lowest bidder,? sources said.? ?
According to the sources, had Oman Trading been given an opportunity to negotiate the prices, they were willing to give a further lower price to supply LPG.??
?If Shell International could bring down the price by US $ 1.50 per MT, we were told that Oman Trading too would have given a better price than Shell,? sources alleged.? ?
The question arises as to why the Ministry of Public Enterprise Development is silent over this matter. The subject minister Kabir Hashim promised at a press conference that he will take action against the members of the TEC, if found guilty of violating government procurement guidelines and if there?s any wrongdoing involved in offering the tender.??
The reason given by the TEC to SCAPC to select the second lowest bidder disqualifying the lowest bidder was due to shortcomings and non-compliance in vital aspects during their tenure of LPG supply to Litro Gas. According to the sources who wished to remain anonymous, Shell International Trading too had to pay a penalty for having shortcomings and non-compliance in vital aspects during their tenure of LPG supply.??
?According to the TEC selection criteria, Oman Trading International?s efficiency is not satisfactory and the number of vessels they have to supply LPG is very much lower than that of Shell International whose efficiency is satisfactory and have supplied LPG to Litro with no records of stock out situations. Although their claim is as such, in the event the government to government negotiations succeeded between Sri Lanka and Oman, Litro would have purchased from Oman Trading leaving aside all their past records and even the number of vessels they have taken up as an issue. Earlier Oman Trading was managed by another company and now it is a company owned by the Government of Oman,? sources added.? ?
We wanted them to know their prices to supply gas, their price was US $ 65 per MT which was higher than the price we quoted at that time. Therefore, we requested them to take part in the tender and their bidding price was US$ 48
Speaking on conditions of anonymity, a senior officer at Litro Gas levelled allegations for disqualifying the lowest bidder claiming that past records cannot be considered after lifting the one year ban on Oman Trading. ?If Oman Trading was blacklisted, it was due to their faults. What was the reason to lift the ban? Once the ban was lifted, they have to forget the past records and take them back to the system. Having lifted the ban and once again talking about their earlier mistakes cannot be justified. On what basis the TEC rank the bidders and brought Shell International as number one. We do not see any faults with the SCAPC members or with the Cabinet of Ministers but solely with the TEC,? sources said.? ??
Meanwhile, according to Litro Gas Board Minutes (of August 17, 2017), this paper is in possession, former Director Litro Gas Aruna Siriwardena had raised many questions from the Board in regard to the tender procedure.? ?
Refuting allegations, Ministry Secretary Ravindra Hewavitharana said that there was no scam involved in the tender and added that the entire procurement process followed by Litro Gas and the recommendations made by the SCAPC was transparent.??
Although the Ministry Secretary said that Litro Gas Lanka was not happy for the Ministry decision to lift the ban imposed on Oman Trading, this newspaper is in possession of a letter dated May 16, 2017 sent by Executive Chairman Litro Gas, N.M.S. Moonasinghe to the Sultan of Oman Talal bin Salim Al Jabri allowing them to participate in the tender. The letter further states as thus, ?Dear Sir, With reference to your e-mail dated May 15, 2017 at 22.20 (GMT+05.30), you will be able to participate at the tender (Ref: LGLL/ LPG/082-IMP/2017) as per the decision taken by the Board. Please send your representative to collect the tender documents as per the published advertisement?.? ?
When asked whether TEC informed the SCAPC how Shell too had to pay a penalty in the guise of an additional duty, Hewawitharana said that he was not aware of it and added that the TEC would have done it purposely.??
?Under this ministry we are dealing with about 90 institutions. We are busy and have no time to go through each and every detail. Proper recommendations should come from the TEC as we have to trust them. In the event if wrong details are provided it is their fault,? Hewawitharana said.??
When contacted the CEO of Union Development and Investment [Pvt] Ltd., Murugesh Devanayagam, the Local Agent for Oman Trading, said that he did not want to make any comment.??
Managing Director Litro Gas Muditha Peiris and Finance Director Lakmali Hapuarachchi told this newspaper that the allegations that have been levelled against awarding the tender were baseless and added that every step carried out before and after the tender had been done transparently.??
Since there are allegations against the TEC members representing Litro Gas Lanka for violating the government procurement guidelines, when asked who nominated the three Litro Gas officers, Peiris said that they were chosen by the Department of Public Finance and Treasury. Although specifically asked whether Litro Gas Lanka had sent the names to the Ministry of Public Enterprise Development to be forwarded to the Department of Public Finance, Peiris said it was the Ministry that had sent out the list of names they have.??
Peiris further said as to why tenders were called to purchase despite letters exchanged by Oil and Gas Minister of Oman to Minister Kabir Hashim to supply LPG on a long term basis under a sovereign agreement between the two countries.??
According to the TEC selection criteria, Oman Trading International?s efficiency is not satisfactory and the number of vessels they have to supply LPG is very much lower than that of Shell International, whose efficiency is satisfactory
?We wanted them to know their prices to supply gas, their price was US $ 65 per MT which was higher than the price we quoted at that time. Therefore, we requested them to take part in the tender and their bidding price was US$ 48. All decisions were taken by the SCAPC after the TEC reports were submitted to them,? Peiris added.??
When asked whether former Board Member Aruna Siriwardena raised questions regarding the tender procedure followed by the TEC at the Board Meeting held on August 17, and that allegations were levelled for not providing the necessary documents to the Board Members, Peiris said that although certain matters were raised at the board meeting once all the necessary documents were given, Siriwardena?s concurrence was given not only to extend the gas supply to the country to the existing supplier but also to award the tender to supply LPG for 2017/2018 to Shell International as well.??
Rejecting Peiris? claim of giving his concurrence to award the tender to Shell International, former Director Aruna Siriwardena told the Daily Mirror that he never signed any document to give his consent to the said tender.??
?I categorically reject the statement made by Muditha Peris that I gave my concurrence to offer the tender to Shell International. In order to extend the period by one month to supply LPG to the country, I gave my consent only after I spoke to Dr. B. M. S. Batagoda (Chairman SCAPC) on his mobile in front of the Board Members at the board meeting when I was told that he agreed to the one month extension,? Siriwardena added.??
However, he declined to make any comment in regard to the tender procedure and wanted to go through the Board minutes if more information are needed.??
Ban lifted on blacklisted supplier after this govt. came to power - Hewawitharana
Public Enterprise Development Ministry Secretary Ravindra Hewawitharana when contacted said that it was due to the failure to supply gas on time by the lowest bidder during their tenure of supply on earlier occasions that made the TEC to reject Oman Trading application.??
Ministry Secretary Hewavitharana said the reason why Oman Trading was not given an opportunity to negotiate their price was due to their earlier track record. ?Oman Trading was blacklisted earlier but when the Oman Minister made a request to Minister Kabir Hashim that they would like to supply LPG to Sri Lanka on a government to government basis, our Minister had asked them to offer a price at which they could supply gas.
The price given at that stage was above the market price. However at the tender they gave a lower rate. Since the Oman price was above the market price, the SCAPC did not ask them to negotiate the prices and made a request only to Shell which they reduced by US $1.50 which was less than Oman Trading,? Hewavitharana said.??
According to Hewavitharana, the main reason to reject Oman Trading was their failure to supply gas consistently due to lack of enough vessels and added had the tender was awarded to them, it takes 10 to 13 days to supply the gas whereas Shell International takes only three days since they bring the gas from Maldives.??
When asked what would have happened if the Government to Government negotiations were successful and if so whether Oman Trading would have? rejected this time too, Hewavitharana did not comment.??
Litro Gas Lanka was not happy for lifting the ban. Considering the past records, the TEC said that they will not recommend Oman Trading
In regard to non-offering the tender to the lowest bidder, he said that the TEC was seriously considered about Oman Trading?s failure to supply LPG on several occasions earlier and added the SCAPC decided not to award the tender to an irresponsible party. ?Once they were blacklisted but later once this government came into power it was lifted. Government of Oman made a special request to the Minister that they are ready to supply LPG to Sri Lanka. Litro Gas Lanka was not happy for lifting the ban. Considering the past records, the TEC said that they would not recommend Oman Trading,? Hewavitharana said??

According to weather statistics, a depression is likely to develop in the low pressure area during the early hours of tomorrow, moving towards the north ? north-westward direction in the sea area of the Bay of Bengal and was located nearly 850km North-East of Trincomalee by this evening.

Govt. takes measures to reduce CoL
	
In an effort to contain the rising cost of living (CoL) especially the rising price of coconuts, the Cabinet yesterday decided to permit the import of coconut kernel to lower prices.
The soaring prices of coconut had impacted on 33 per cent of the cost of living while the price on rice had a 27 percent impact. The number of coconuts released to the retail market for household consumption had dwindled in recent years because of the surge in demand by industries manufacturing value added products such as cooking oil.
Against this background the government decided to permit the relevant companies to import kernel for their industries and thus allowing coconuts to be released to the retail market. At present, there are also restrictions in the quarantine laws to import coconuts.
The government has decided to take further measures for the import of rice to maintain stocks. (Kelum Bandara)

The Blue senior who usually leaves his city residence for the hill country destination in the evening would make his first stop at a roadside eatery close to the gem city. Leaving his security detail behind, the purohita would enter the eatery alone. Thereafter, he is escorted to the privacy of a special guest room where he is provided with whatever that suits his appetite. And he would emerge from this room after a long rest to resume the trip.
The veteran politico?s next stop on the journey is where he would take a longer rest.?
By the way, it was when the recounting of juicy tit-bits about the politico?s night activity while on this trip was sending the Diyawanna members into fits of laughter, the hero in the story himself was seen walking towards them.
?Ah! Mallila appear to be enjoying a good joke,?? remarked the purohita as he neared the group. All continued laughing without making a reply.?
Blissfully unaware, the members were having a laugh at his expense, he slouched away after waving them a goodbye.

One month on, Lebanon?s PM rescinds shock resignation
	
?
BAABDA AFP Dec5, 2017-Lebanese Prime Minister Saad Hariri said on Tuesday that he had withdrawn his resignation, a month after his shock announcement that he was quitting sparked political upheaval.??
The announcement brought some respite to Lebanon, which had been gripped by fears of new political and economic instability in a country driven by deep divisions and caught up in regional rivalries.??
Minutes after Hariri?s announcement, Paris said the Lebanese premier would attend talks Friday in France on the situation in Lebanon, which US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson will also attend.??
??The council of ministers thanks the prime minister for rescinding his resignation,? Hariri said, reading from a cabinet statement issued after its first meeting since his return two weeks ago.??
Hariri announced he was stepping down on November 4 in a televised address from Saudi Arabia, a move widely seen as part of the boiling tensions between the Saudi kingdom -- a long-time Hariri backer -- and its regional rival Iran.??
In his resignation, Hariri lambasted Tehran and its Lebanese ally, the powerful armed movement Hezbollah, for destabilising his country and the Middle East.??
He later said he would consider coming back as premier if Hezbollah stopped intervening in regional conflicts, including the wars in Syria and Yemen.??
In recent days, consultations across the political spectrum have sought to find a compromise between the Saudi-backed camp led by Hariri, and Hezbollah?s Iran-backed bloc.??
On Tuesday, Lebanon?s cabinet, which includes both blocs, reaffirmed its official policy of ?disassociation?, or remaining neutral in regional conflicts.

Predator is almost invisible...
	
A camouflaged snow leopard proved to be very difficult to spot as it crept up behind unsuspecting prey in India.
Wildlife photographer captured what at first appears to be a photo of a herd of blue sheep, nonchalantly gathering on the side of a rocky slope.
But a closer look reveals a snow leopard hidden somewhere in the frame.
Incredibly, the sheep notice the leopard just as it jumps out to attack, and they safely run away from their predator.
When examining photos of the incident , the lonesome male leopard can be hard to spot as he lurks behind the oblivious herd, waiting for the optimum time to strike.
Virtually invisible in the center of the shot, the lonesome male leopard can just about be seen peering from behind a collection of rocks and shrubbery: a scene that would even give 'Where's Wally' a run for its money. (Daily Mail)
Vandyke, the general manager of Wild Images UK, who spent several days following the fleeting feline in February, said: 'When I look at this image, I often find myself wondering how many leopards we must have walked past in the field and never actually saw. (Daily Mail)

SL may have less pollution, but cricketers should play: Dhawan
	
Though Sri Lankan cricketers may feel uncomfortable in Delhi because they might have less pollution in Sri Lanka, Indian cricketer Shikhar Dhawan said it was necessary for cricketers to do their duty and play regardless of the condition, the Wisden India reported yesterday.
Being from the capital city, Dhawan was understandably quizzed about the pollution ? the smog ? that has led to quite a few controversial episodes in the Test match. The Sri Lankans have suffered a fair bit, but on Tuesday, Shami also complained of uneasiness and asked for medical attention.
?I am born and brought up in Delhi. This is the time of crop harvesting in some of the states, this month pollution is a wee bit more,? said Dhawan. ?Also this time, we haven?t experienced good sunshine. Maybe if there was sunshine, pollution would have been less. I don?t think playing cricket was a problem. As far as Shami is concerned, he is fine and you will see him in action tomorrow.
?There are a lot of players in our team who are not used to this pollution thing in Delhi as they come from other states. But if you have been assigned a job (to play), you can?t let anything come in its way. If you are playing in Delhi at some other point of time, the pollution won?t affect you. I would never say that there is no pollution in Delhi. Of course, there is pollution, but during the winters as there is a lot of smog, so whatever the situation is, we need to adjust accordingly. When you are playing for the country, you have to do your job.?
Dhawan also acknowledged that the Sri Lankans were not used to the unhealthy conditions because where they come from ?the air quality is much, much better.?
?Maybe they are uncomfortable, maybe there is less pollution in Sri Lanka. There are more beaches in Sri Lanka. It?s natural that a city surrounded by beaches won?t have pollution. Of course, they may be feeling ? as I said I won?t hide that there is pollution in Delhi,? said Dhawan.
?Now if it?s there, it?s there. Can?t help it. Maybe they are feeling it more, I don?t know. But still I would insist that we should do our duty ? that is to play cricket.?

Sri Lanka affected by  bio piracy  menace
	
Repercussions of advances in bio technology
Sri Lanka is designated as a fascinating island due to its biodiversity and topographic heterogeneity. We as a nation are gifted with a variety of indigenous plants which further enhances the splendor and the value of the country. It?s fitting to state that Sri Lanka?s biodiversity is the remarkable high proportion of genetic species among its flora and fauna: 23% of the flowering plants and 16% of the mammals in the island are endemic.
25% of the country?s plants are endemic and thus Sri Lanka often becomes a victim of bio theft and piracy
	23% of the flowering plants and 16% of the mammals in the island are endemic
	bio piracy is a situation where endemic plants are used by others who patent them for their own profit making
Biological diversity or biodiversity is a term used to describe the variety of life on Earth. It refers to the wide variety of ecosystems and living organisms; animals, plants, their habitats and their genes. Sri Lanka has a wide range of topographic and climatic variation that contributes to the special features of its biodiversity. But at present Sri Lanka?s biodiversity is facing an imminent danger as a result of bio- piracy.
It is mainly the medicinal plants that are being subject to bio piracy in Sri Lanka. At present the legal provision against bio piracy in Sri Lanka doesn?t control the situation and hence more room has been created for bio piracy in the island
Bio-piracy means unauthorized access of biological material and using them for commercial purposes without paying proper compensation or obtaining monopolistic rights either from an individual, a company or institution regarding certain biological material or indigenous knowledge, while those resources belong to a community, region or another country. In simple terms it is a situation where indigenous knowledge regarding nature is used by others for their own profit, without obtaining permission from the country of origin or without paying compensation or giving recognition to the indigenous people themselves.? ?
Former Deputy Director of Customs and the President of Lanka Nature Conservationists Samantha Gunasekara in an interview with the Daily Mirror said that although Sri Lanka had been identified as a biodiversity hotspot in the world, biodiversity was under threat due to bio piracy.? ?
?It is mainly the medicinal plants that are being subject to bio piracy in Sri Lanka. At present the legal provision against bio piracy in Sri Lanka doesn?t control the situation and hence more room has been created for bio piracy in the island. Even though, we have opened the floor on numerous occasions to discuss the economic, social and environmental loss that bio piracy brings to Sri Lanka, no effective action has yet been taken by the authorities. That?s really pathetic simply because it?s our prospects that are being smuggled in and profited on by foreign individuals,? Gunasekara said.? ?
Illegal collection of indigenous plants? ?
?
Former Customs official Gunasekara revealed that plant smugglers usually smuggle plants for the use of ornamental, medicinal and narcotic values inherent in them.? ?
Vandana Shiva, an Indian scholar, environmental activist, food sovereignty advocate and anti-globalization author says, ?Bio Piracy is biological theft and is described as the illegal collection of indigenous plants by corporations who patent them for their own use?. She has also written a book on Bio piracy: The Plunder of Nature and Knowledge.? ?
Unauthorized exportation? ?
Before bio piracy was known by the world, the term ?bio-theft? existed. Bio-theft is defined as the unauthorized exportation of the different components of indigenous bio-diversity. The export of any indigenous plant, animal or microbe without submitting to existing laws is bio-theft, regardless of the ornamental, medicinal and narcotic values.? ?
Gunasekara explained that ?bio-theft? signified a quantitative aspect of genetic plants. Infamous Wallapatta (Gyrinops walla) or Kekatiya (Aponogeton) cases can be regarded as examples of ?bio-theft?. But when we focus on the impacts of ?bio-piracy, we observe that they have a drastic impact on qualitative aspects such as rights, due revenue, etc. Kothala Himbutu (Salacia reticulate) is the best local example and nevertheless over 100 patents had been obtained by various individuals and institutions based on this plant alone.? ?
The moment a plant is taken out of a natural habitat without authorization, it amounts to bio theft. But bio theft can lead to bio piracy if the stolen plants are smuggled outside the country to obtain patents for these plants or any other product that is produced using the physical material of that plant. Most of the patents regarding Sri Lankan genetics have been obtained by Japan.? ?
Originated in Sri Lanka
?Bio-piracy began to flourish consequent to the advancement of bio technology in the world. It is an alarming issue that requires pertinent provisions with immediate effect. This first came under the spotlight in Sri Lanka in 1993 regarding an incident that occurred in 1985 where 12 medicinal plants, including Nutmeg (Sadikka), Masakka, Nigella sativa or Black Cumin (Kaluduru), Sida alnifolia (Heenbabila), Weniwalgata and Clove (Karabu Nati), etc were patented in Japan (J.P. No: 60054312 of 28/03/1985) under the title of ?Preventive for dental caries?. The extracts of these plants were used in toothpaste, gargles, ointments or chewing gum, manufactured by Nissan, Tsurui and Yakuhin.
Subsequently, there have been series of similar incidents where patents and other license have been obtained by various individuals or companies regarding indigenous plants of Sri Lanka. But, unfortunately no Governments has taken instant steps so far to obtain the due revenue and to formulate a proper mechanism to conserve the genetic resources of Sri Lanka. Therefore it?s necessary to take pertinent actions regarding this serious issue,? Gunasekara added.??
Solutions to curb bio piracy? ?
Organizing programmes to make the general public aware of the value and importance of Sri Lanka?s bio diversity.? ?
	Policy makers should give consideration to tapping our natural resources without allowing other countries to exploit our endemic plants.? ?
	Collaborative projects need to be created on the grounds of finding ways and means to protect the genetic plants of Sri Lanka.? ?
	Encouraging and facilitating the local researches and productions by providing equipment and training to the personnel in subjected fields.? ?
	Providing biotechnology to local scientists.? ?
	Strengthening the legislation and imposing severe penalties to penalize the offenders are also methods to control this menace.? ?
?It is necessary to improve the knowledge of plant identification among law enforcement authorities and environmental units at police stations. Workshops and awareness programmes need to be arranged to give the officials a basic knowledge as to what sort of plants they should look out for and how to press charges to increase the efficiency of the enforcement of environmental law,? Gunasekara added.? ?
Plants that aren?t covered by the Flora and Fauna Protection Ordinance as ?protected plants? are further protected by the Forest Conservation Ordinance Sections 20 and 24
In conclusion, it?s a noteworthy fact that there are more than one thousand native plants species which are used to cure various health disparities. It?s obvious that Sri Lanka is blessed with Indigenous knowledge which is passed from generation to generation by native physicians. This knowledge needs to be conserved for the welfare of the future generation Therefore, relevant provisions should be made by the authorities to address this issue in order to conserve the invaluable genetic plants in Sri Lanka.? ?
The main reasons for rapid prevalence of bio piracy in Sri Lanka
Sri Lanka becoming a biodiversity hotspot? ?
	Plants being located in a small territory allowing easy access to them and the concentration of plants? ?
	Enormous indigenous and medicinal knowledge that is documented and tested? ?
	Lack of biotechnology? ?
	Existence of a variety of plants which have ornamental, medicinal and narcotic values? ?
	25% of the country?s plants are endemic and thus Sri Lanka often becomes a victim of bio theft and piracy? ?
	Strategic location? ?
Legal aspect?
An Environmentalist and senior environmental lawyer Jagath Gunawardena told Daily Mirror that the legal framework in Sri Lanka was quite adequate to apprehend plant smugglers. But he pointed out that what was lacking was its proper enforcement. Moreover, the authorities had turned a blind eye on implementing existing laws in the face of illicit practices.? ?
?According to Section 42 of the Flora and Fauna Protection Ordinance, it is illegal to remove, uproot, destroy, damage or injure any plant or for that matter sell, expose or offer for sale any plant that is named as a protected plant in the Ordinance. Plants that aren?t covered by the Flora and Fauna Protection Ordinance as ?protected plants? are further protected by the Forest Conservation Ordinance Sections 20 and 24,? Gunawardena stated.? ?
He said that the act of bio-piracy signified the grabbing of genetic plants by force just like in ordinary piracy, but what made it different in bio piracy was that the force was exerted through the intellectual property laws.? ?
?The various components of bio-diversity like Polpala (Aerva lanata) and Ranawara etc, can be exported legally under the provisions of the Forest Ordinance (for all non-protected plants) and under the Fauna and Flora Protection Ordinance. If the use of components is purely for research purpose, it has to be subject to an agreement between the provider (not the individual or the institute, but one of the two departments) and the recipient. If there is any possibility of commercial use, then it has to be subject to a Material Transfer Agreement,? Gunawardena said.? ?
He further said that the intellectual property tool that was being used to commit bio-piracy in the majority of cases is the Patent and added that there had also been a few instances in when a Plant Breeders Right or a Plant Variety Protection Right had also been used.? ?
The word Patent is usually associated with new inventions and a patent is a legal right conferred on a person who makes a new invention which enables the use of it without competition (a monopoly) for a limited period of time, in order to let the inventor obtain a profit as a reward to the efforts put into making something that is useful to the society.? ?
Gravity?
The party which commits bio piracy uses the gaining of patents as an offensive tool even though patents are designed to defend intellectual property rights. Gunawardena said that the monopoly rights after obtaining a patent would extend up to 20 years, within which period the country that actually owns the smuggled plant had no benefit.? ?
It has been analyzed the world over that commercial exploitation is the third major threat to the survival of wild species. The country which owns the rights regarding genetic plants doesn?t benefit through bio piracy, as it doesn?t receive the due revenue out of the biological resources. Especially income through genetic resources is huge. Compared with the exported quantity, we do not get sufficient income in the trade of certain biological resources. Yet environmental damage done is more.? ?
According to Section 42 of the Flora and Fauna Protection Ordinance, it is illegal to remove, uproot, destroy, damage or injure any plant or for that matter sell, expose or offer for sale any plant that is named as a protected plant in the Ordinance
At the same time, if a patent is obtained for a plant endemic to Sri Lanka, the patent rights holder could stop the importation and selling of the plant if Sri Lanka attempts to export even though Sri Lanka is the country of origin.? ?
?Kothala Himbutu, which is well-known for its priceless medicinal properties, has been smuggled out of the country in this manner. The plant has currently 132 patent applications among which 114 are against the interests of Sri Lanka,? Gunawardena pointed out.? ?
Since the exploiters can enjoy patents rights freely, there is a direct consequence to the export markets and incurring revenue in Sri Lanka.? ?
	When the plants are taken out of the natural habitat by large quantities, they might even face the danger of being extinct.? ?
	Losing certain traits of endemic plants like colour variations could be considered as a repercussion of bio piracy.? ?
What should be done?
Samantha Gunasekara suggested that it was applicable to promulgate laws to issue proper patents so that transactions of endemic plants in Sri Lanka would be done legally and thus the economy of Sri Lanka would benefit at grand scale following the revenue incurred through endemic plants.?

US assistance for combatting corruption in SL
	
The US?State Department on Tuesday?announced its continued assistance to Sri Lanka and three other countries to prevent and combat corruption in these countries.
In a statement, the State Department said the US government has provided foreign assistance for anti-corruption efforts in Sri Lanka since 2016 to improve the functioning of the country?s legal system and civil society and to enhance good governance.
?Programs include the provision of a Resident Legal Advisor to provide anti-corruption and asset recovery training, and support to the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery and Corruption,? it said.
According to the World Bank, it said over US$ 20 billion is stolen by corrupt officials annually.
?This is money that should be used to ensure the sustainable development of the countries for essential services such as schools, hospitals?and roads. Rather than lining the pockets of corrupt officials, these funds should help grow economies and improve the well-being of the people of the countries,? it said.?
The US?has?contributed US$?1 million to the World Bank and United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime?s (UNODC) Stolen Asset Recovery Initiative (StAR) to organize the Global Forum on Asset Recovery (GFAR) and provide technical assistance to support country-level capacity building and coordination on asset recovery cases.
?The GFAR, which is being co-hosted?by the US and UK, provides a platform to enable the four focus countries of Nigeria, Sri Lanka, Tunisia, and Ukraine to make tangible progress on significant asset recovery cases in connection with financial centers and other jurisdictions,? the State Department said.
In addition to co-hosting GFAR, the US has provided significant technical assistance to the four focus countries to strengthen anti-corruption and asset recovery efforts.

Weerakumara, fourth NFF leader to challenge Wimal
	
A fourth prominent member of the National Freedom Front (NFF) is challenging the party leader Wimal Weerawansa.
Deputy Leader of the NFF and Parliamentarian Weerakumara Dissanayake said yesterday that he was oppose to the view held by NFF leader Wimal Weerawansa that the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) should be divided. "If we allow that to happen United National Party (UNP) leader Ranil Wickremesinghe would emerge as the executive President in 2020" he said.
Earlier the National Organizer of the NFF Piyasiri Wijenayaka, General Secretary Priyanjan Vitharana and former Parliamentarian Jayantha Wijesekara had parted ways with Weerawansa's leadership in a short period of about two months.
Although Mr. Vitharana's resignation as the General Secretary of the party was attributed to health reasons, sources said that he had serious differences with his leader..
Addressing a news conference held at his office in Anuradhapura, Dissanayake stated that he was concerned about the unity of the SLFP since if the SLFP is divided it would create chaos in the country and pave the way for Ranil Wickremesinghe to come to power.
?I am not worried of being a member of any party. What I am concerned about is to establish justice in the country. Hence, Maithri and Mahinda Rajapaksa should work hand in hand so that the SLFP would be protected, he added.
My political future as a member of the National Freedom Front (NFF) would depend on how the decisions would be taken in the party in future, MP Weerakumara Dissanayake said yesterday. (Sheain Fernandopulle and Athula Bandara)
