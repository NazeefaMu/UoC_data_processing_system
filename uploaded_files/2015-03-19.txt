Circular on Tamil national anthem unconstitutional: BBS
	
	The Bodu Bala Sena (BBS) organisation today emphasised that issuing a circular to let the National Anthem be sung in the Tamil language violates the constitution.
	The General Secretary of the BBS, Ven. Galagodaththe Gnanasara Thera said the entire statement, made by the Leader of the Democratic People?s Front (DPF) Mano Ganesan was unconstitutional and President Maithripala Sirisena could not issue a circular because it was against the constitution.?
	?? ?
	He alleged that even the Prime Minister and the National Executive Council (NEC) had been appointed violating the constitution and now the President could not allow the National Anthem to be sung in Tamil by using a circular. He said the current government was trying to create new problems by making these kinds of statements and as a national organisation the BBS was condemning this proclamation.
	Speaking to the Daily Mirror, the Executive Director of the BBS, Dilantha Withanage said according to the constitution the government has to have a referendum and seek the people?s views to change the language of the National Anthem.
	He said that changing the language of the National Anthem would not solve the communal problems in Sri Lanka, and the government has to think and take more wise decisions for the country?s future.(Yoshitha Perera)

FB pages of MR, Wimal, Udaya attacked
	
	Pivithuru Hela Urumaya (PHU) claims the Facebook fan pages of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, Provincial Councillor Udaya Gammanpila and MP Wimal Weerawansa have been subjected to a cyber-attack.
	The PHU in a statement claims that the ?likes? for the FB fan page of Gammanpila had drastically dropped by 1200 between 7 ? 9 pm last Friday.
	?Since it was a sudden drop, we took measures to check the FB fan pages of former President Rajapaksa and parliamentarian Weerawansa. The likes on their FB fan pages had dropped by 15,800 and 4100. Although it?s a common occurrence for likes to drop, a drastic drop of this nature in such a brief period is cause for suspicion,? the PHU notes.
	The PHU claims they believe it?s a result of the actions of an opposing group that has deployed an internet ?bot? to decrease the likes on the fan pages of these politicians.
	PHU furthermore stated that Councillor Gammanpila has notified the FB administrators concerning these attacks.

Police are mixing up civil and criminal cases: MR
	
Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa said today that the police are mixing up civil cases and criminal cases for political ends and that we should be careful about it.
Mr. Rajapaksa said this when he visited former deputy minister Sarana Gunawardane at the Mahara prisons this morning.
He said arresting people in this manner in connection with civil cases could not be considered good governance.
When asked about development, Mr. Rajapaksa said development had come to a standstill while the government was preoccupied with taking revenge on opponents.
To a question whether he would be involved in politics in the future, Mr. Rajapaksa said currently he was enjoying his leisure and visiting his colleagues who were remanded. Mr. Rajapaksa said he expected the SLFP president to look into these arrests and mete out justice.
?Mr. Gamini Senarath was questioned over a vehicle leasing incident and Lohan Ratwatte was also summoned for interrogation. We can see this trend. This should be stopped and good governance ensured,? he said. (News and pix by Lal S. Kumara, Chaturanga Chandrasekera)

President has no power to grant elephants: Dy. Minister
	
Tourism and Sports Deputy Minister Wasantha Senanayake said yesterday that it was illegal for any president to make grants of elephants on ?Sannas Pathraya? as no legal provisions had been vested in them by the constitution to do so.
Mr. Senanayake said he had sought advice from the Attorney General on whether a President were empowered to make grants of elephants in terms of Article 33(D) of the constitution, and that he had been told by him that the President was not given such powers to make any grants and dispositions either by the constitution or in the Flora and Fauna Ordinance.
Mr. Senanayake said he had informed President Maithripala Sirisena in written about the matter. ?So many elephants have been granted by former presidents starting from President J.R. Jayawardene in 1978 and ending with Mahinda Rajapaksa. They may have done it without having knowledge of the legal provisions to do so as no one had pointed it out before. In terms of Article 33(D) of the constitution, a President can only make grants of lands and immobile properties. Nowhere in the constitution has the granting of elephants being mentioned, he said.
When asked whether he was going to take action against the grants of elephants that had been made by previous Presidents, minister Senanayake said he was not going to cancel them because it was not practical since it had been done since 1978 and added that he would make sure that the incumbent president would do no such a thing.
Mr. Senanayake said the ministry would not register any elephants that had been granted by any President in the future whereas it had been done in the past.
Mr. Senanayake said he was against the export of elephants to foreign countries as the elephant density was dwindling in the country and added that the practice should be banned. ?We should stop exporting elephants as the elephant density in the country is dwindling and it is difficult to find elephants even for cultural events today. India had already banned elephant exports,? he said. (Ajith Siriwardana)
