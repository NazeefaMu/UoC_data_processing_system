A.S.P. Liyanage, whose private mansion has become a hot topic; yesterday lodged a complaint with the Colombo Crime Division (CCD) about his house after he had alerted the media that he had been summoned by the CCD for questioning about an alleged money laundering charge.
Before reporting to the CCD, he told the media that the police had summoned him to question him under the Money Laundering Act whether he had sold his private mansion in Koswatta, Nawala for Rs. 450 million.
Instead, he called over at the CCD in view to lodge a complaint about the recent media reports about selling his mansion. He claimed that the reports had caused him grave inconvenience and embarrassment and had requested for a police probe.
When contacted, CCD Director SSP Roshan de Silva told the Daily Mirror that his unit neither had any case nor any intention to summon A. S. P. Liyanage for a statement, and that Mr. Liyanage had falsely alerted the media that CCD asked him to report to the CCD at 2.00 pm.

ComBanks ATMs set new records this Avurudu
	
If withdrawals from the ATMs of Commercial Bank in the Avurudu season are anything to go by, Sri Lankans celebrated their New Year on a grand scale in 2015, establishing new records for cash dispensed from the largest automated teller network owned by a single bank in the country.
The previous record of Rs 2.05 billionfor cash withdrawals in a single day set on 11th April 2014, was broken on Friday, 10th April 2015, when users of the Commercial Banks 610-terminal ATM network withdrew Rs 2.49 billion, an increase of Rs 441 million.
In a record breaking 12-day run, the Banks ATM network dispensed Rs 17.2 billion between the 1st and 12th of April 2015, of which Rs 11.8 billion was dispensed over the seven days from 6th to 12th April, the Bank said. The number of transactions processed in the first 12 days of the month exceeded 2 million of which 1.3 million was during the peak week.
Commercial Banks two-day record for cash dispensed via its ATM network was also broken this year, with Rs 4.55 billion on the 10th and 11th of April 2015, beating last years two-day figure of Rs 4 billion. The average ticket size of a withdrawal on 10th April 2015was Rs 11,642, also higher than a year previously.
The Bank said that these statistics demonstrate the important role the Commercial Bank ATM network plays in the lives of millions of people in Sri Lanka, and reaffirms the value of the technology as well as the capacity, robustness and reliability of the Banks ATM network. These aspects are particularly important during peak shopping seasons such as the Sinhala and Tamil New Year and Christmas.
The Commercial Bank ATM network is the largest automated cash dispensing facility owned by a single bank in Sri Lanka.Holders of Commercial Banks standard ATM cum Shopping Debit Cards can withdraw up to Rs 40,000 from the Banks ATMs per withdrawal. The Bank also offers customers the option of setting their own ATM withdrawal limits up to a maximum of Rs 100,000 a day, and a point-of-sale limit of up to Rs 500,000.

Former president Mahinda Rajapaksa was not a god and there was no need to protest against the Bribery Commission decision to summon him, Jathika Hela Urumaya (JHU) General Secretary and Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka said today.
He said even he had given a statement to the Commission with regard to a complaint he had made on a deal of coal.
No need to be afraid or to hesitate to give a statement to the Commission if the person had done nothing wrong. And others should not protest and obstruct attempts of the Commission to record statements, he told a news conference today. 
However, he said the charge levelled against Mr. Rajapaksa that he had given MP Tissa Attanayake a ministerial post as a bribe, raised the question whether the charges was appropriate.
As the incident happened during the election campaign, the Elections Commissioner should have taken care of it. If the reason behind making the charges at this crucial moment to postpone the 19th Amendment, then I believe it had been successful, he said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

Pan Asia Bank, in response to the increased customer demand for housing loans, has commenced promoting its Nivasa housing loan scheme with a host of value added features.

Apart from that the borrower also has the ability to obtain loans up to 5-years on a fixed interest rate.
Since most of the Sri Lankans are now eager to own a house rather than renting one as in the past, Pan Asia Banks Nivasa housing loan scheme has been designed to enable them to own a house of their own providing them the freedom and independence that come with living under ones own roof. Adding more value to its borrowers the bank is also looking to tie-up with several leading companies relating to housing industry to obtain discounts for Niavasa customers.
Pan Asia Bank, with the renewed focus on the Nivasa Housing Loans expects to target mainly monthly wage earners living in Sri Lanka and certain categories of Sri Lankan migrant workers who can avail this facility by opening an NRFC account with the bank. Other than these two categories the bank also targets customers who are interested in investing in a second home for investment purposes.
Under Nivasa housing loan scheme, customers can obtain loan facilities up to Rs.25 million with a repayment period of up to 25 years. Nivasa housing loan scheme also allows customers to borrow up to 100 percent of the BOQ value when the customer owns the land and in other cases up to 75 percent of the BOQ value.
Pan Asia Bank also has an array of other loan products such as Consumer loans, Auto loans, Leasing, Hire purchase and Credit Cards for the Sri Lankan work force with true value added benefits and plans to continue to introduce new products to these segments.

Video: South Korean PM offers to resign
	
	South Korea's Prime Minister Lee Wan-koo offered to resign on Monday amid a growing political scandal.
	Lee will stay in his official role until South Korean President Park Geun-hye accepts his resignation. He has transferred his role of chairing Cabinet meetings to the deputy prime minister for the time being, according to his office.
	Park heard about the resignation and called it "regrettable," according to the South Korean presidential office.
	Calls for Lee to resign began after South Korean tycoon Sung Woan-jong was found hanging from a tree in Seoul in an apparent suicide on April 9. Sung, who was under investigation for fraud and bribery, left a note listing names and amounts of cash given to top officials, including those who work for the President.
	Lee and seven other politicians with links to the South Korean President are under investigation. A special prosecutor's team has been established to investigate the case.
	Lee had adamantly denied the allegations as the scandal escalated: "If there are any evidence, I will give out my life. As a Prime Minister, I will accept Prosecutor Office's investigation first."
	Park has said that she is taking the accusations very seriously. Before departing on her trip to Central and South America, she condemned political corruption in her country.
	"Corruption and deep-rooted evil are issues that can lead to taking away people's lives. We take this very seriously."
	"We must make sure to set straight this issue as a matter of political reform. I will not forgive anyone who is responsible for corruption or wrongdoing."
	Park is in Peru and is expected to arrive back to South Korea on April 27. (Seoul-CNN)

(3) With reference to above (2) what was the nature of discussions and interaction
(4) Who was the head of the Department Of Public Debt who interacted with Governor Mahendran and what did the conversations center around the week prior to the bond issue Did they discuss acceptable coupon rates on the 30-year bond
(5) When was the date it decided to accept the offer of 12.5 percent on the bond issue
(6) The report does not inquire into the market actions of Perpetual Treasuries beginning one week prior to the bond issue. There is insufficient forensic examination of market actions of Perpetual Treasuries Limited the firm owned by Governor Mahendrans son-in-law.
However, the committee has gone into detail about the Bank of Ceylons (BOC) actions in the bond bidding process. So, why not the same zeal for Perpetual Treasuries market actions in the run up to the bidding process

TN fishermen demand uninterrupted fishing rights in SL waters
	
Over 100 fishermen from Tamil Nadu will meet Indian External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj next Monday to give a petition demanding uninterrupted fishing rights in the Sri Lankan waters.
According to Rameswaram-based fisher leader S. Emarit, who represents owners of mechanised boats, leaders of fishermens associations across the State, the fishermen representing areas including Rameswaram, Nagapattinam, Karaikal, will participate in the meeting scheduled to be held in New Delhi on April 27.
We plan to give a petition to the Minister demanding that Sri Lankan fishermen stay away from the sea on days we go fishing there, he said.
Sri Lankan fishermen of the Tamil-majority Northern Province of the island have, for long, accused their Tamil Nadu counterparts of destroying their livelihoods by encroaching and using destructive bottom-trawling practices.
The Sri Lankan Navy periodically arrests Indian fishermen on charges of engaging in illegal fishing methods.
Tamil Nadu fishermen, however, argue that they fish in Sri Lankan waters as part of their traditional rights, a claim Sri Lankan fishermen  still trying to recover from the war that tore their region apart  have repeatedly called unfair.
In the recent round of talks between fishermen from both the countries, held in Chennai in March, the Indian fishermen said they could reduce the number of their fishing days from 90 to 83, even as they attempt to phase out trawling.
The Sri Lankan delegation said it would respond after holding consultations with members of the fishing community.
We are waiting to hear from our Sri Lankan brothers, Mr. Emarit told The Hindu on Monday.(The Hindu)
