CPC TUs express doubts about Htota Port lease agreement
	
Despite the signing of US$1.1 billion deal to lease the southern Hambantota port to China, Ceylon Petroleum Corporation's (CPC) trade union Collective today expressed their concerns whether they were hoodwinked by the President Maithripala Sirisena.
CPC TU Collective Convener D J Rajakaruna told Daily Mirror the Union doubts whether the appointment given for a discussion with the President Sirisena on August 01 will be canalled and therefore sent a letter to the President for a re-confirmation.
He also said Unions were not informed about any agreement so far signed by the government on leasing the Port to China or handing over the China Bay Oil Tank Farm to India.
However, He said the Union members are still looking forward to attend the scheduled discussion with the President Sirisena and later will decide their trade union action depending on the outcome of the discussion.
Meanwhile, Mr. Rajakaruna warned the government that CPC trade union would take stern action with the support of countrys leading trade unions if the government had signed the Hambantota port original agreement without making the amendments as per assurance given by the President Sirisena.

DC does not have a mandate under the Constitution - Report
	
The 1978 Constitution, as amended to date, is not clear about the appointment of a Delimitation Commission (DC) or to specify a mandate for such a commission, DC annual performance report for the year 2016 has revealed.
The report said the constitutions of Sri Lanka up to the first Republican Constitution of 1972 provided a clear mandate and rationale for DCs based on population and land characteristics.
The delimitation for local government electoral boundaries comes under the purview of a different National Delimitation Committee under a separate piece of legislation, leading to some confusion on responsibility for the subject of Delimitation, rationales and mandates. Therefore, it is important that there be a set of principles and a framework that would help the Government to re-establish a rational basis for delimitation that is linked to population patterns, land and other relevant characteristics of electoral districts in the future. In doing so, it would be sensible to set up such principles and framework for establishing electoral boundaries at all levels, whether at national, provincial or local government, the report said.
At the same time, it is observed that, in Sri Lanka there has been no priority given to synchronise, nor ensure consistency among geographical boundaries for electoral (National, Provincial, Local Government), administrative (District, Divisional Secretariat, GN Divisions) and service delivery (health, education, security, etc.) purposes. This has led to sub-optimum resource allocation as well as inefficiencies in co-ordination among electoral representation, administration and service delivery within the country. The present context provides a timely opportunity to address such lacunas in the national system, it added.
The report further said that electoral boundaries (National, Provincial, and Local Government), b) Administrative boundaries (District, Divisional Secretariat, and Grama Niladhari Division) and c) Service delivery boundaries (Education, Health, Justice, Police, Agricultural Extension, etc.) are neither consistent nor synchronized and had recommended that elected representation, decentralized administration should be addressed when it comes to ensuring an effective delimitation.

Sampanthan on permanent solution to Sri Lanka's ethnic conflict
	
The historic Indo-Sri Lanka Peace Accord that mooted a permanent solution to the decades long thnic conflict in the island nation was signed on July 29, thirty years ago.
In an interview with the Hindu, veteran Tamil leader and Leader of Opposition in the Sri Lankan Parliament R. Sampanthan recalls how the then government and TULF, the main Tamil party, had marathon negotiations for 20 days during 1986 that brought about the 13th Amendment of Constitution.
"The Tamils struggle for self rule had been in the political arena shortly after Independence. When the accord was signed in 1987, it was almost 40 years. The accord itself was preceded by various rounds of negotiations between the Sri Lankan government and Tamil side under the auspices of the Indian government after the riots that took place in 1983," says Mr. Sampanthan who was involved in the negotiations.
Though the agreement acknowledged the unity and territorial integrity of Sri Lanka, it also emphasised that the autonomy of various cultural groups should be preserved. There were Sinhalese, Tamils, Muslims and Burghers living in Lanka, each having a distinct culture and linguistic identity, says Mr. Sampanthan.
The accord paved way for the 13th Amendment of the Sri Lankan Constitution which is considered the first significant step towards devolution of powers between the Sinhalese and Tamils.
The accord also favoured holding a referendum, which the Tamil parties opposed.
"If Rajiv Gandhi was not be killed, the matter (ethnic conflict) would have been resolved," feels Mr. Sampanthan who hopes that government's effort to rewrite the constitution would find a permanent solution to the issue. "An effective substantial devolution will give people a sense of self rule, a sense of belonging to the country, and that the country belongs to them," he says.
Mr. Sampanthan also says that India's interest in Sri Lanka is not limited to economy or strategy and strongly feel that his neighbour remains committed in resolving the Tamils issue.(The Hindu)
