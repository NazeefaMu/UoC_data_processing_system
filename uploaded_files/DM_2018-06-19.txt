Outgoing UNHR Chief commends SL
	
Outgoing UN Human Rights High Commissioner Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein yesterday commended Sri Lanka and several other countries for hosting at least five visits by thematic mandates in the last five years.
The other countries which hosted at least five thematic mandates were Argentina, Australia, Azerbaijan, Brazil, Chile, Georgia, Ghana, Greece, Honduras, Italy, Kazakhstan, Mexico, Republic of Korea, Serbia, Tunisia, Ukraine, the UK and the US.
In his opening statement and global update of human rights concerns at the 38th session of the Human Rights Council which commenced yesterday, High Commissioner Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein said he was pleased to note a number of positive developments with respect to access for Special UN Procedures.
These include an increased response rate to communications, now at 68 per cent and Afghanistans issuance of a standing invitation to all mandate-holders, taking the number of States having done so to 118 UN Member States and one non-member Observer State, he said.
Regarding engagement with the Treaty Bodies, he said he welcomed long-outstanding reports to the Committees by Bangladesh, Cabo Verde, Central African Republic, Guinea, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Tonga and Zambia.
Allow me also to applaud Qatars accession to the Covenants and Afghanistans accession to the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, alongside many other ratifications.
My Office stands ready to support them in efforts to implement these commitments to ensure respect for their people's rights, and I urge other countries which have not ratified these and other human rights treaties to do so, he said.
The 38th session of the UN Human Rights Council which is being held at the the Palais des Nations at Geneva in Switzerland would be concluded on July 6. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

Posts Minister to introduce tailored recruitment procedure
	
Post, Postal Services and Muslim Religious Affairs Minister M.H.A. Abdul Haleem said today a tailored recruitment procedure will be introduced to the Department of Posts to overcome postal issues.
Responding to a journalist at a news conference, he said following a discussion with the National Salaries' and Cadres' Commission, the chairman had agreed to introduce a separate service minute for the department.
The minister said there was a delay in resolving the matter, as the commission had failed to provide a positive response and a Cabinet sub-committee decision had recommended a tailored recruitment procedure with the involvement of the trade unions to be handed over within a month.
He invited all postal workers to report for duty and said he would inform Parliament and the Cabinet of the shortcomings in the Public Administration circular 06/2006. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

Reach for Water 2018 A community service project by Peradeniya University
	
Picture shows chief guest Chief Minister Sarath Ekanayake and veteran Rotarian John Baskaran leading the run. 


The Charity run of the signature community service project REACH FOR WATER of the Rotaract Club of University of Peradeniya ended in high spirits, gifting Kandy a massive charity run experience. Chronic Kidney Disease of Unknown etiology (CKDU) is a much discussed, yet less addressed issue. This project Reach for Water was designed to address this issue, by ensuring the access to clean water. 
The first phase was a charity run which was organized to raise awareness amongst public about the Kidney Disease issue prevalent in the country and to raise funds. This charity run took place through the Kandy town starting from the Bogambara Stadium Car Park, under the patronage of the Central Province Chief Minister Sarath Ekanayake. Mayor Kesara Senanayake, Basnayaka Nilame Mahendra Ratwatte, Commissioner of Kandy Municipal Council Chandana Tennakoon, Paul Harris Fellow Rotarian and Past President John Baskaran from Rotary Club of Kandy also graced the occasion. 
At the closing ceremony, an awareness event was arranged with an expert talking on the kidney issue, and a celebrity meet-and-greet arranged along with a musical event. The celebrities were Kavinga Perera, Ridma Weerawardhana, Supun Perera, Yomal Samarakoon, Samare & Samare, and Amuthu was the band in attendance. The sponsors were LTL Holdings, Rupavahini, Nestle, Sun Aqua and private donors. All the registrants were sporting the T-shirt and the wrist band which was designed as a fund raiser to the event. Media coverage was given by Rupavahini, Janasarana, Kandy zone and Pera Beats. Daily Mirror and Ceylon Today were the print media partners. 
The funds raised were channeled to the water filter installation at Galamuna Divisional Hospital at Budhdhayaya Polonnaruwa area, which will take place in the near future, and for the refurbishment of the temple at Uva Kudaoya, Wellawaya in collaboration with the Janasarana fund. Special measures were taken to ensure the sustainable existence of the project, where letters of consent were taken from the relevant parties assuring the acceptance of the responsibility to maintain the water filter. The Reach for Water-2018 project showed its momentum, and ended with promising future prospects.

Rouhani to visit Bern, Vienna amid efforts to save Iran deal
	

DPA, 18th JUNE, 2018- Irans President Hassan Rouhani plans to visit Switzerland and Austria in early July, both European countries announced on Monday, stressing that the trip comes as Europe tries to salvage the nuclear pact with Tehran.
The aim is to find ways of preserving the progress made as a result of the agreement and of ensuring the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons in the region despite the decision of the USA to withdraw from it, the Swiss government said in a statement.
Rouhani is scheduled to stay in Switzerland on July 2-3 and have talks with his Swiss counterpart Alain Berset and members of the Swiss government in Bern.
On July 4, the Iranian politician is set to meet Austrian President Alexander Van der Bellen and Chancellor Sebastian Kurz in Vienna.
Rouhanis first trip to Western Europe in two and a half years comes after US President Donald Trump withdrew from the nuclear deal in May and moved to reinstate economic sanctions.
Trump argued that the deal was far too weak to prevent Tehran from building nuclear weapons, and he complained that it did nothing to limit Irans influence in the wider region. In contrast, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) that monitors Iran has been saying that the country has significantly curbed its nuclear programme, as foreseen by the deal. Tehrans leaders say they are willing to uphold the deal with the remaining five countries - Britain, France, Germany, Russia and China - but only if the European Union makes sure that Iran can keep doing business with the West despite the US sanctions.

It was revealed in Parliament today that more than Rs.120 million had been spent for the 60-member delegation which accompanied the President for the United Nations General Assembly sessions in 2016.
This was revealed in response to a question asked by MP Udaya Gammanpila on the cost incurred by the government. State Minister Niroshan Perera said the 60-member delegation included several ministers, media personnel and president's staff.
The MP asked whether it was a part of good governance to take a large delegation and at such a high cost.
The minister said the previous government had taken even larger delegations spending millions of rupees to which the MP said the present government was elected by the people to correct such bad precedents. (Ajith Siriwardana and Yohan Perera)

## Title: SL should not go for anymore coal -powered electricity generation

SL should not go for anymore coal -powered electricity generation
	


Protests at Norochcholai over the damage done to the health of the people living near and distant to the plant
	Renewable energy is better than coal or LNG but it cannot be relied upon to provide solid base load power any time soon

In an article published in the SUNDAYISLAND of January 7, CIMOGG, employing a minimum of technical language, set out several compelling reasons why coal-powered electricity generation was wrong for Sri Lanka. Engineer Tudor Wijenayake (TW), in an article in the DAILY FT of June 7, has given much useful additional information including valuable data on costs in this connection.
TW reports that, in a note addressed by Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) engineers to its membership, the unit price of electricity had been given as Rs.7.90 per kWh whereas, in a later submission made by the CEB to the Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL), the cost of coal-based generation at Lakvijaya had been given as Rs.14.53 to Rs.14.74. Why the discrepancy Was it to gain ill-informed institutional support from their fellow-workers for the use of coal by giving the misleading lower figure of Rs.7.90 per kWh We are compelled to speculate in this manner on account of the publicity that has been given from time to time about the controversies over the tenders for the procurement of coal that go to show that it is a vastly attractive long-term goose with a profusion of golden eggs for ministers, ministry officials and senior CEB engineers who are responsible for formulating policy, preparing specifications, calling and evaluating tenders, providing superintendence at the suppliers end, testing/acceptance at this end, and so on. [STOP PRESS: As this article was about to be sent to the media, we came to learn from two newspapers that Minister Champika Ranawaka has called for a Presidential Commission of Inquiry into the massive frauds in importing coal from 2009 onwards, stating inter alia that this is many times greater than the Bond issue. CIMOGG fully endorses Minister Ranawakas call for a PCoI as it has become increasingly-convinced over the years that the import of coal is heavily soaked in corruption].

There are bound to be some crooked political heavyweights who favour coal because it would prove to be a long-term godsend that would keep on yielding golden eggs for many years without leaving room to exploit our natural gas resources for power-production purposes
At no time have we seen an assessment by the CEB on the costs of mitigating the adverse environmental impact associated with the use of coal. The issues that should be looked at in this context are how to deal with the several polluting operations that are involved in transporting, storing and burning dirty coal and coping (if that is at all practicable) with the large volume of by-products such as fly ash, which has only a limited market in Sri Lanka. Moreover, there are no realistic, economically-viable means of capturing the hot, gaseous oxides of sulphur, nitrogen and other similar particularly noxious emissions that are discharged through the flues into the atmosphere from where they will cause health and other problems over a fairly large area. Practical methods of dealing with heavy metals like cadmium, lead and mercury that are present in small but significantly dangerous proportions are just not available. In short, if it were possible to control all the various types of pollution that are inevitable with coal-powered electricity generation, the cost per unit of electricity would skyrocket over the costs associated with virtually all the other competing sources.
It is no secret that there have been sporadic public protests at Norochcholai over the damage that is being caused to the health of the people living near and distant to the coal-burning power station there. Public displeasure is bound to increase with time as some of the polluting products will almost certainly spread further and further, and also accumulate wherever they reach ground level. The latest news in this regard is that the CEB and the Central Environmental Authority are at loggerheads regarding the issue of the environmental clearance for the Norochcholai power station. This dilemma will, no doubt, be resolved in the short-term by the CEB resorting to strikes, working-to-rule and industrial sabotage that will put the government under unscrupulous pressure.
Both coal and Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) produce heat and carbon dioxide, and deplete the natural reserves of these two commodities which could probably be put to less damaging and more productive uses as technology advances. These two fuels may appear to be equally bad on these two counts but, when one takes into account the numerous intractable environmental problems that are associated with coal power, as compared with the absence of similar problems in the case of LNG, there is no doubt that the latter is vastly preferable. There is no spread of pollution in connection with its shipping, unloading, transport, handling and combustion. Burning LNG does not produce unwanted sulphur dioxide, nitrous oxide and heavy metal combustion products. It is by far the better fuel for thermal power generation.
The next paragraph is almost a direct quote from the writers aforementioned article in the SUNDAYISLAND.
A key consideration is that Sri Lanka has no coal of its own and will forever be dependent on whichever sources are identified as producing the particular type of coal that is required for the particular design of the steam boiler that is selected. In contrast, over the past three or four decades, LNG has become more readily available from several sources and the design of the burners and boilers is not sensitive to the source of the LNG. Of the greatest relevance is the fact that Sri Lankas marine resources are known to include substantial natural gas reserves which, if developed with reasonable expedition, would be a fuel source that cannot be monopolised by cartels of foreign suppliers working in concert in the international markets to keep raising their prices as and when they please as they would undoubtedly do if we are forced to rely on them to supply coal over many decades. Whereas the price of coal will unquestionably keep increasing outside the control of Sri Lanka, the state could readily supply LNG indefinitely to the CEB at only the cost of developing and maintaining the LNG infrastructure, without the need to follow price variations in the international markets. During the 3-5 initial years during which our gas fields and related infrastructure are being developed, it would not matter too much if we have to pay a premium for importing LNG.

TW reports that, in a note addressed by CEB engineers to its membership, the unit price of electricity had been given as Rs.7.90 per kWh whereas, in a later submission made by the CEB to the Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL), the cost of coal-based generation at Lakvijaya had been given as Rs.14.53 to Rs.14.74

It was not many months ago that the public were informed that a firm decision had been taken to work with LNG and not coal. It is, therefore, utterly shocking to learn that the government is being pressurized to go back to the plan to build two clean coal power plants which are mythical entities if the emphasis is on the word clean as we have already explained in our aforesaid article. As the hidden rewards of buying more and more coal would be of astronomical proportions over the years, those interested in pushing coal have enormous potential to wield their diabolically unpatriotic financial power to bend the more honest politicians, administrators and technocrats to their will.
There are bound to be some crooked political heavyweights who favour coal because it would prove to be a long-term godsend that would keep on yielding golden eggs for many years without leaving room to exploit our natural gas resources for power-production purposes. How the avarice of these traitors is to be countered is hard to foresee but what is absolutely imperative is that not even a single new coal-powered power station should be allowed anywhere else in tiny Sri Lankaif we are to supply electricity economically, and avoid damaging the health of our people and ruining the environment.
As mentioned in the said article, renewable sources of power would be better than coal or LNG but, as things stand at the moment, they cannot be relied upon to provide solid base load power any time soon. The authorities must necessarily expend a substantial amount of funds to keep increasing the renewable energy component of Sri Lankas increasing power requirements. This advice has no bearing on the coal versus LNG conflict.
CIMOGG calls upon the President, the Prime Minister and the Cabinet not to betray Sri Lankaby giving in to the crude self-interest of those promoting coal.

SriLankan: 51% of the losses was accumulated interest
	
Public Enterprise Development Minister Lakshman Kiriella said yesterday the bank interest accumulated over a period of time accounted for 51 per cent of the total losses incurred by SriLankan airlines.
He said this had led him to seek concessions from the lending banks.
The minister told Daily Mirror that during the previous government several aircraft were bought over the prevailing market rates a leased out at unfavourable rates had contributed to the losses that were a burden to this government.
He said the airline flew on 42 routes, but only two were profitable and that he was planning a cost-cutting programme and fleet rationalization.
We need to place the airline on a sound financial footing. After that, we can find a foreign investor to manage it as a Public-Private Partnership (PPP), the minister said.
Reports say that by March this year, the total loss stood at US$107 million. (Kelum Bandara)

## Title: Today is late Dudley Senanayakes 107th Birth anniversary DUDLEY - THE  INCOMPARABLE STATESMAN
## Section: Opinion
## Date: 19 June 2018 12:30 am
Today is late Dudley Senanayakes 107th Birth anniversary DUDLEY - THE  INCOMPARABLE STATESMAN
	
Gal-Oya multi-purpose project was the brainchild of Dudley Senanayake
	He was a man who had a powerful almost tactile attraction, over everyone around him
	His unique qualities made him stride the political arena like a colossus, till his demise

Today, on the late Dudley Senanayakes birthday, with the party he belonged to and loved, as part of the Unity government, as he never did long or high jumps to any other party, as has become the norm of our times, one is reminded of him.
When he resigned as Prime Minister, he sat back , but never deserted the party. He returned as Leader, at the request of UNP seniors who felt that only he ,could lead the party back into victory. From wherever he is, he must look down, with happiness, that the present Leader of the party has done what he can to restore freedom, democracy and an independent judiciary once more, all of which Dudley fought hard for, throughout his political life.
Anyone who knew or worked with the late Dudley, was aware that he was a true liberal democrat, who would have never trod any other path, but the straightest one through the democratic way, through free and fair elections to gain power. He never made false promises to gain power, and was known to always speak the truth. He was a man above all other, in every sense of the term He always stood for an united country, where all our citizens are treated as equal citizen, irrespective of community, caste or faith. This is what the very name of the UNP stands for. Dudley, strove hard and long to adhere to gaining equal status for all citizens. He believed strongly, that being the majority community did not mean asserting ones authority or dominion aggressively, over the minorities.

Dudley Senanayake was a devout Buddhist, but one who believed, that everyone should have the right to practise the religion of his/her choice in peace and freedom
The late Dudley was never the proverbial dull as dishwater politician, whose entire ambition was used up ensuring, that he never said anything even remotely controversial. He was a man who had a powerful almost tactile attraction, over everyone around him. His intense, brilliant heated arguments with his peers in Parliament, at that stage the crme ala crme of politicians were in our Parliament, all educated men of vision, whatever their political affiliations were. These arguments and political cross talk expanded his horizons and interests. But he never carried malice in his heart beyond the precincts of that most august assembly. Politicians of that era respected each others views even in disagreement. Diverse political affiliation did not mean political enmity, vulgar abuse and violent behaviour. They often walked across the floor and shook hands with each other after heated arguments in the House. This is in sharp contrast to the filth thrown across the floor, vile behaviour patterns and language which is the present norm of behaviour in Parliament today.
Perhaps the fact that he was a cricketer, instilled in him his sense of justice and fair play, which was a hallmark of his tenure in politics. His other hobbies of music, reading and photography were also tthose of a cultured and cultivated mind. Dudley Senanayakes unique qualities made him stride the political arena like a colossus, till his demise. He was an excellent speaker quick and unsurpassed at wit and repartee, had a powerful voice, an infectious and uproarious laugh and the rare ability to laugh at himself. His appetite and love for food is also a legend. A shining beacon of his political life was his steadfast loyalty to his party through thick and thin. Even when he was pushed out, he never criticized the then Leadership of the party. He knew that loyalty to party and loyalty to the Leader have to go together for success. He would have been shocked and appalled at political crossovers, shifting loyalties and stabs in the back, which are the negative aspects of politics today, which only hinder the progress and unity of the party.
He would have strongly opposed The Presidential system, and the preferential vote which are the main reasons for infighting and disunity in all parties. He also believed that absolute power corrupts absolutely, of which we had a good dose during the previous regime.
Dudley Senanayake was a devout Buddhist, but one who believed, that everyone should have the right to practise the religion of his/her choice in peace and freedom. That is true tolerance as preached by Gauthama Buddha, which seems absent today. Dudleys greatest contribution, to our countrys development, was in the field of agriculture, which always was his first love. During his food drive, he was a familiar sight in far off pockets of rural Sri Lanka, with his camera slung over his shoulder. His heart was with the rural peasantry of the country. Bradman Weerakoon, who was his secretary, commented once that the Senanayakes were from a rural base. Their Sundays as a family, were spent at Botale. After meeting constituents, the order of the day were four Bs. Bath, Beer, Buth and Bed!
The Gal-Oya scheme, the countrys first multi purpose project, for the transition to mechanized agriculture, was Dudleys brainchild. His unchallenged integrity ensured that there were absolutely no allegations of corruption levelled at him. Gal-oya flowed where it had to flow and not into private companies.One recalls his simplicity today, when even as Prime Minister, he would drive his little Triumph Herald.The scenario today, with elephantine sized cabinets, has several vehicles and security accompanying the occupants and their families. Dudley had a great sense of vision and mission and shunned pomp and pageantry. He was never guilty of double standards in any situation. His transparent honesty of purpose and high honour were always maintained in the rich tapestry of his life. A modest man and a gentleman to his fingertips, he was an accomplished parliamentarian, his interventions in debate were always studied and polished.
The seething mass of humanity who made homage to him at his death, from all walks of life, and all sides of the political spectrum, were proof of the respect he commanded from one and all. This was his finest hour, when the country mourned as a whole, for one they regarded as a National Treasure. No crackers were lit at his death, everyone was in a state of shock, anguish and despair. It was Dudleys dream that every Sri Lankan could proudly say This is my own, my native land. I hope and pray that this will come about one day, and that we will then again remember the late Dudley Senanayake, whose dream it was that this be so.

15% VAT on channelling fees, surgeries to be removed
	
The Cabinet today approved to remove the 15% Value Added Tax (VAT) imposed on doctors fees, channelling fees and on surgeries at private hospitals with effect from July 1, Finance Minister Mangala Samaraweera said.
However, he said the tax on in-house medical charges would remain unchanged because they believed that if a patient could afford to obtain in-house medical care, then that patient is also capable of paying the tax.
Addressing a news briefing held at the Finance Ministry, Minister Samaraweera said, as a sensitive government, they realised that the 15% tax increase on health services at private hospitals was a burden to the people.
The VAT increase came into effect from January 1, 2016. As an initial measure, Out-Patient Department (OPD) services were exempted from the tax increase. As a sensitive government, we understood that the average citizen also needs to make use of the facilities offered by private hospitals and that the taxes that were being charged was a big burden to them. Therefore, we removed the tax on a request made by Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne and on the instructions of the President and Prime Minister, he said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

When the jana met  the janapriya
	
The fifties and sixties were clearly epoch-making decades for much of the Western world and particularly for the United States. Almost overnight, the bourgeoisie, so accustomed to their way of life, found their culture eroding with the onslaught of the bohemians, the heroes of the counterculture who found their icons in the novels of Norman Mailer and the Beat Generation and the politics of Abbie Hoffman. But these were relatively prosperous years, probably the most prosperous of 20th century American life. David Brooks, in his clear accessible account of this phenomenon, Bobos in Paradise, contends that what transpired was the substitution of one way of thinking for another, a substitution that was short-lived, as the return of the corporate culture of the seventies and the eighties proved. Probably the best illustration of this shift can be found in the movies. In 1967, The Graduate, one of that years most successful films, depicted its hero in the form of Benjamin Braddock, who rebelled against conformity and the sexual depravity of the WASP (White Anglo Saxon Protestant) middle-class; 20 years later, its director, Mike Nichols, created a hero out of a stockbrokers secretary who finds her way to the upper echelons of corporate America in Melanie Griffith, with Working Girl. From the one to another, there was a shift, from the bohemian values of the sixties to the bourgeois values ofthe eighties. 

In the hands of the masters, the middlebrow and the lowbrow is formalised: baila turns into The Moonstones, Dalreen Suby enters
Such shifts are not rare, and are almost certainly reflected in the culture of a particular era. Its interesting, thus, to note that while Abbie Hoffman was ranting and raving about the virtues of revolutionary politics and the Beatniks were hailing the LSD and drug culture of the fifties and sixties, Sri Lanka, conversely, faced a resurgence of bourgeois values. It was in the fifties that the efforts of the likes of Devar Surya Sena led to the creation of a cultural sphere. Led by the offspring of the upper class, these preservationists laid the bedrock for the emergence of that sphere, despite the errors they made when formalising the same culture they sought to preserve. In the United States the fifties and sixties had become the repository of revolution, of bohemia, of countercultural rebellion; in Sri Lanka, those decades would become the repository of the formal, conservative, middle-class, and petty bourgeois culture, the culture which was seen most discernibly in the films of Lester James Peries, the songs of Amaradeva, the plays of Sarachchandra, and the ballets of Chitrasena. While liberal and Westernised and modernised at the outset, these art forms were tinged with the middle-class puritanism of the audiences that patronised them. That most of these pioneer artists hailed from the petty bourgeoisie helped fuel this dichotomy, between modernism and traditionalism, even further. Premaranjith Tilakaratne recounts in his memoir Durgaya that when he got the great Sarachchandra to listen to the songs from West Side Story, the latter had just one reply to give: It is nothing but cacophony! This was not an era of polyphony, let alone cacophony: it was the era of the formal culture, patronised by the children of 1956, the rural bourgeoisie and the urban petty bourgeoisie, who were soon to become (as the novels of Karunasena Jayalath showed) the heroes of the art forms which had until then depicted them as props and supporting players. That Lester Periess most successful film until then was Golu Hadawatha, which valorised this milieu, is no cause for wonderment. It was inevitable in a way. 
Definitive eras
What made these two decades the definitive eras of cultural renaissance, of the formal culture that is, was economic prosperity on the one hand and social puritanism on the other. Prosperity and Puritanism: these were the two factors which spurred an entire era. The petty bourgeoisie had been emancipated by Sinhala Only. The groundwork for that revolution had been laid down, as I wrote before, by the offspring of the Anglican elite, the Devar Surya Senas and the Hurbert Rajapaksas whose work would be taken over by the Sunil Shanthas, the Lester Perieses, and the Amaradevas. What 1956 did was to amalgamate the results of these efforts, which had been transformed into a definitive cultural renaissance, with the traditionalism and class prejudices of the milieu which led the Sinhala Only revolution, the rural bourgeoisie and the urban petty bourgeoisie. When you watch Lesters films, particularly those from the sixties, you can spot out this traditionalist streak even in his most daring work: both Golu Hadawatha, which valorises young love, and Delovak Athara, which valorises the downtrodden and the unprivileged (it was Philip Gunawardenas favourite movie), dont go beyond the middle-class canvas they revolve around. In this sense the zeitgeist of this period was captured succinctly in Ran Salu, Lesters most religiously saturated film, which brings the good/bad binaries of village life (exemplified by P. K. D. Seneviratnes script) to the streets of Colombo 7, through the acting of Punya Heendeniya. (The Ceylon depicted in Ran Salu, as one reviewer put it, was a Ceylon full of affluence and middle-class aspirations. Perhaps he may not have seen a paradox in the intermingling of that prosperity with the puritanism of Punyas character, and how the triumph of goodness does not clash with the aspirations of this middle-class.) 
The Moonstones and Dalreen Suby

In the hands of the masters, the middlebrow and the lowbrow are formalised: baila turns into The Moonstones, Dalreen Suby enters the scene and apotheosises the meaning of nightclub music, on the one hand, while on the other, the second generation baila performers, M. S. Fernando and Anton Jones in particular, continue to pander to a more populist crowd. Mango Kalu Nande, which highlights and parodies a division between the householder and the servant (a division which would be sustained by the Clarence Wijewardenas and the Annesley Malawanas of this period), becomes the first Sinhala song to be broadcast on the English service of Radio Ceylon. The coastal belt, from Chilaw to Mount Lavinia, transforms kaffiringa into a formalised musical genre, and Neville Fernando, the pop voice of the fifties, effectively gives way to Clarence and Annesley. The middle-class of these two decades, lulled by economic prosperity, indulge in their bourgeois values even further, while on the other side of the world Vietnam and the Civil Liberties Union would put a further strain on the American economy and social sphere. We were a world away, happily continuing with a separation between the jana and the janapriya. It would take an entire decade for the janapriya sensibility to shift, mainly through Jothipala, who would take that sensibility to the populist masses, away from Clarences milieu. 
In the seventies, and in pretty much every cultural sphere, including the movies, there was change: rampant, raging, and unforgiving. The complacent conservatism of the sixties, in the popular culture, yielded to a more humanitarian, liberal, slightly leftist streak. This was the era of Anton Jones, who sang about Maru Sira and the cyclone of 1978 and the Kanthoruwawhich fermented sloppiness, apathy, and laziness, and the era of Jothipala, who crooned about love unhindered by class origins. To be sure, The Moonstones, which had now transformed into the Super Golden Chimes, continued with their separation of the householder and the servant, though with much less vigour than before. (Moving away from Mango Kalu Nande, they instead sang Kanda Surinduni, Ma Adare Nangiye, and one of my favourites from these years, Sudu Menike. They did not bother with the householder and the servant, in other words; they celebrated, blissfully, casually, the sights, the sounds, and the clashes of their personal lives.) But this decade entailed a paradigm shift. The artists of the fifties and sixties had been adamant on sustaining a divorce between the jana and the janapriya. The seventies, by contrast, saw a coming together of these two cultural streams. 

The complacent conservatism of the sixties, in the popular culture, yielded to a more humanitarian, liberal, slightly leftist streak
It happened in unprecedented, almost unheard of ways. Mahagama Sekara and Somadasa Elvitigala teamed up to conjure a song for Indrani Perera and the Three Sisters: Gaala Suwanda Rasa Handun (its exuberance and refreshing pace might have almost been composed by Clarence Wijewardena).
Shelton Premaratne got together with Father Marcelline Jayakody and Dharmasiri Gamage for a song which brought together Nanda Malini and Dalreen Arnolda: No East No West - Rangum Gayum Wayum. (Father Jayakody and Dalreen were given the English section, while Gamage and Malini got the Sinhala section.) Having been shunned by filmmakers, for the crime of bastardising and corrupting the sarala geeya, Clarence found work in the film industry through H. D. Premaratne, who adapted the Ummagga Jathakaya to Sikuruliya and thus revitalised Swineetha Weerasinghes career. Amaradeva, having tried his luck with him once before, finally composed a song for Jothipala: Kanden Kandata (from Tharanga). These were quirks, yes, but over time they became more and more frequent. It is from here, thus, that we must explore that tragedy I outlined at the beginning of this series of essays: that while the janapriya sensibility continues, unabated and fresher than ever, the jana sensibility, which met the janapriya long, long ago, has stalled. How, why, and wherefore this came about, I leave for the next piece.

The Ministry of Wildlife should manage human animal conflicts while safeguarding species, Deputy Minister of Environment Ajith Mannapperuma said today.
He was referring to the attempt made by Minister of Wildlife and Regional Development Sarath Fonseka to relocate the only remaining two wild elephants of Sinharaja Forest elsewhere.
The two elephants that are used to live in the wet zone are to be sent to the dry zone. Behaviour of elephants in wet zones is different to those in the dry zone. The two elephants, if sent to the dry zone, would get harmed by the other elephants in the dry zone, the Deputy Minister said. (Yohan Perera)

A contractor who won a tender to put up a four-storey library building hosted a select group of local politicos and white-collar up high-ups and their families to a grand dinner at a high-end hotel in an upcountry city, they say.

However, Pohottuwa politicos had boycotted the function saying that it was improper for the contractor to host them or for them to be his guests either.
Meanwhile, rate-payers are said to be asking one another: If the contractor could spend so much on the feast, how much must his profit be from this contract

Agriculture ministry will be shifted to Govijana Mandiraya: Minister
	
Agriculture Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said today he would, within three months shift the Agriculture Ministry to a State-owned building from the high profile DPJ towers at Battaramulla and that a six-member committee had been appointed to make recommendations.
The committee chaired by Nihal Fernando PC comprises Senior Attorneys Jagath Wickramanayake and Asoka Weerasuriya, former Assistant Auditor General D.L.P. Dias, Civil Engineer Chandana Edirisuriya and Agriculture Ministry Legal Officer G. Hector.
The committee is expected to study the circumstance that led to the Agriculture Ministry being shifted to another building from the state-owned Govijana Mandiraya in Battaramulla.
The minister said the DPJ towers leased at an annual rent of Rs.252 million was not suitable to house the Agriculture Ministry and that there were legal issues with regard to the lease agreement.
"This ministry attends to the needs of millions of farmers and the people. The DPJ building lacks space for a proper library, conference room, proper access road waiting rooms, ample elevator facilities and even a spacious vehicle park," he said. "This building appears to have been built with the corporate sector in mind and not the state sector and paying a colossal Rs.21 million a month is extremely unfair. The lease agreement expires in five years and at that time the amount paid will be Rs.1, 560 million, sufficient to build two similar buildings."
The minister has requested the Speaker, Karu Jayasuriya to arrange for the return of the Govijana Mandiraya back to the Agriculture Ministry. He has pointed out that it was a national crime to use the DPJ Towers building while the Agriculture Ministry has its own building. (Sandun A Jayasekera)

Army warns legal action against harbouring absentees, deserters
	
Sri Lanka Army yesterday said that they are continuing countrywide operations to arrest its absentees or deserters and warned legal action against those who would be harbouring them.
Issuing a statement Sri Lanka Army Headquarters appealed all concerned in earnest to desist from aiding or abetting the army deserters or absentees, harbouring or using them for any anti-social acts since such misdeeds as the Army could not hold any responsibility for such involvements.
It has been noted that sections of Army deserters or those absent without leave (AWOL), some of them still in hiding, are reportedly involved in committing criminal acts, robberies and various anti-social acts in different parts of the island.
In many instances, most of those elements operate under the cover or patronage of businessmen, underworld leaders, employers and different other stakeholders and resort to such anti-social acts as per Police reports. Furthermore, some of them appear to seek refuge from some politically powerful elements and members of the clergy.
It is pertinent to remind here that provision of employment or harbouring of those Army absentees or deserters amounts to breach of the countrys existing law and is an offence punishable in Court (133 of the Penal Code).
Likewise, respective Police stations as well as Sri Lanka Military Policemen with the assistance of state agencies are continuing operations island-wide to arrest those elements since they have repeatedly failed to receive general amnesties for legal discharge or report back to their relevant Army formations for discharge procedures, it further said.

Ban with political undertones
	

Security camps have now been declared out of bounds for activists of ex-personnel welfare bodies involved in activities such as enlisting new members and setting up new branch offices, they say.

Some sources claim that a close buddy of a former secretary functions as a consultant of one of these welfare bodies and this ban is linked to the recent rumour that this former secretary is set to enter the national political scene with a big bang.
The use of camp premises for holding ceremonies of ex-personnel too has now been tabooed, they say.

## Title: Chandimal found guilty of changing condition of ball: ICC

Chandimal found guilty of changing condition of ball: ICC
	
Sri Lanka captain Dinesh Chandimal has been suspended from his sides third and final Test against the Windies after he was found guilty of changing the condition of the ball during the second days play of the second Test, which concluded at Gros Islet on Monday, the ICC said today.
During a hearing held at the end of the St Lucia Test, in which video evidence was used in the presence of the Sri Lanka team management as well as the match officials, Chandimal admitted putting something in his mouth but wasnt able to recall what it was.
Javagal Srinath of the Emirates Elite Panel of ICC Match Referees, on Tuesday, after utilising the time available to him under the code to make his decision, handed Chandimal the maximum punishment available under the code, i.e. two suspension points and a fine of 100 per cent of his match fee.
As two suspension points equate to a ban from one Test or two ODIs or two T20Is, whatever comes first for the player, Chandimal will now miss the day/night Barbados Test, starting from Saturday, 23 June. Furthermore, and because two suspension points correspond to four demerit points, these have been added to Chandimals disciplinary record.
Commenting on his decision, Mr Srinath said: After reviewing the footage of the incident, it is clear that Dinesh applied an artificial substance to the ball, namely saliva containing the residue of something he had in his mouth, an action which is prohibited under the ICC Code of Conduct.
The footage shows that upon receiving the ball, Dinesh took something from his pocket and put it into his mouth. After sucking or chewing whatever he put in his mouth for a few seconds, Dinesh then proceeded to spit on his finger and polish the ball with his saliva which would have contained the residue of the artificial substance that he had in his mouth, on two separate occasions.
During the hearing, Dinesh admitted to putting something in his mouth but couldnt remember what it was, which I found unconvincing as a defence and the fact remains it was an artificial substance.
In the pre-series briefing held on the back of the ICC Cricket Committee recommendations, both the sides were explicitly told that the match officials would be extra vigilant towards all aspects of fair play, including changing the condition of the ball and as such it is disappointing that this has happened.
ICC Chief Executive David Richardson backed the Playing Control Team, when he said: The ICC fully supports the match officials in their decision and will continue to do so in any other such instances.
The strong message from last months ICC Cricket Committee was that there needs to be stiffer sanctions for offences such as changing the condition of the ball and, as such, we will be recommending to the ICC Board at next months annual conference in Dublin to upgrade this to a Level Three offence.
ICC Chief Executive also charged Sri Lankan coach Chandika Hathurusinghe and manager Asanka Gurusinha with a breach of Article 2.3.1, a Level 3 offence, which relates to conduct that is contrary to the spirit of the game.

## Title: CID on Collision course with  CDS over the  fugitive

CID on Collision course with  CDS over the  fugitive
	
According to the B Report submitted to the Colombo Fort Magistrates Court (Case number B 732/ 09) by the CID last week, several witnesses within the Sri Lanka Navy have provided information to sleuths. The information reveals that Chief of Defence Staff, Admiral Ravindra C. Wijegunaratne personally harboured fugitive Lieutenant Commander Chandana Prasad Hettiarachchi alias Navy Sampath at Navy headquarters, provided him with lodging, meals, funds and a means to escape the country before he could be arrested by the CID. Admiral Wijegunaratne was the Navy Commander at the time the incidents are alleged to have taken place which is in March 2017. 

Lieutenant Commander Hettiarachchi is one of many naval officers charged with the abduction for ransom and subsequent disappearance of eleven youth in 2008. Even after a warrant was issued for his arrest, the CID alleges that the then Navy Commander continued to secretly shelter Navy Sampath whilst providing bogus reports to the CID that the officer had Gone Absent Without Leave (AWOL). 
Several weeks before the latest Court Report, Admiral Wijegunaratne and CID Director Shani Abeysekara were involved in a heated verbal exchange in the presence of several senior police officers as well as four Cabinet and State Ministers. The CID Director had bluntly accused the Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) of obstructing criminal investigations and harbouring fugitives including Navy Sampath, to which Wijegunaratne retorted indignantly that he would resign from his position in the military if Abeysekara could prove such an allegation. 
Witnesses to the exchange were Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne, Law and Order Minister Ranjith Madduma Bandara, then Prison Reforms Minister D.M. Swaminathan, State Minister Ajith P. Perera, incumbent Navy Commander Vice Admiral Srimevan Ranasinghe, the Senior Deputy Inspectors General and Directors of the CID and FCID and Presidents Counsel J.C. Weliamuna. 
The group had assembled for a meeting at the Ministry of Public Administration on April 20, 2018 when the Director CID criticized the Navy and its former Commander for aiding and abetting Navy Sampath to flee the country despite repeated requests by the CID to the Navy through its Commander to produce him before the CID. It was at this time that Abeysekara openly alleged that Wijegunaratne had given money to Hettiarachchi, harboured him and enabled him to flee the country in a Navy Fast Attack Craft (FAC). 
After remaining silent for several weeks in the face of challenges from Wijegunaratne to allow him to prove his innocence, the CID has spoken, loudly, and as it so often has done, through documents filed before a magistrate. 
The first such witness was Navy Sampaths own wife, who had told investigators that her husband was being housed in the naval officers mess between March 3 and March 31, 2017. She asserted that she had visited him there on a regular basis. It was during this same period that the Navy had informed the CID in writing that they were unable to locate Navy Sampath. 

After remaining silent for several weeks in the face of challenges from Wijegunaratne to allow him to prove his innocence, the CID has spoken, loudly, and as it so often has done, through documents filed before a magistrate. The first such witness was Navy Sampaths own wife, who had told investigators that her husband was being housed in the naval officers mess between March 3 and March 31, 2017. She asserted that she had visited him there on a regular basis
The CID had sent two messages to the administration branch of the Naval Head Quarters, through Navy Commander Ravindra Wijegunaratne on March 1 and March 28, 2017, requesting the Navy to produce Navy Sampath at the CID Headquarters on March 2 and 31 respectively. According to the CID, these requests went unheeded. 
Another Navy officer who cooperated with the CID is Lieutenant Commander Galagamage Laksiri. According to Laksiri, when he was occupying room number 22 on the third floor of the eight story building, that houses the naval officers mess in Colombo Fort, Navy Sampath was occupying the opposite room. Laksiri has seen Sampaths wife and children visit him very often, corroborating the statement given by the latters wife. 
Commander Laksiri recalled an incident he witnessed with his own eyes. The incident involved the then Navy Commander Wijegunaratne admonishing Navy Sampath not to leave the officers mess. Detailing the exchange, Commander Laksiri recalls that he and Navy Sampath had a chance encounter with Wijegunaratne riding the elevator at the Navy Officers Mess in the late evening. The Navy Commander had inquired where Navy Sampath was going, to which the fugitive had replied that he was going to meet his wife at the nearby lighthouse. Wijegunaratne had accused and warned the fugitive, who was dressed down, that the police were on the look out for him and that he would not be able to assist him in the event he is apprehended out in public. Laksiri opines in his statement that this very strange incident made it clear to him that Wijegunaratne was taking care of Navy Sampath. 
Curious, Laksiri had inquired from the accused what the exchange was about, to which the fugitive responded that he was hiding from the CID fearing his arrested if they found him, just as two fellow officers, Commander Sumith Ranasinghe and Signalman Udaya Kumara were when they were interviewed by the CID on March 2, 2017. Ranasinghe and Kumara were also produced and remanded for complicity in the 2008 abduction for ransom of eleven youth. Both have since been enlarged on bail. 

The Navy Commander had inquired where Navy Sampath was going, to which the fugitive had replied that he was going to meet his wife at the nearby lighthouse. Wijegunaratne had accused and warned the fugitive, who was dressed down, that the police were on the look out for him and that he would not be able to assist him in the event he is apprehended out in public
Laksiri also described another incident which took place the day after the elevator encounter, where he had paid a visit to Navy Sampath in his room at the Officers Mess. Laksiri said that he saw the accused taking some currency notes from a parcel in the cupboard. The CID produced an extract from Laksiris statement that reads When I went to Navy Sampaths room on this particular evening, he was in a hurry getting ready to go somewhere. He then took a parcel out from a cupboard and took some currency notes out of it. When I asked what that was, he said that it is a parcel of currency notes sent to him by the Navy Commander through his Secretary Rear Admiral Hettiarachchi for his personal expenses. Following this meeting, I did not see Navy Sampath and there was a rumor within the Navy that he has fled the country. 

Mystery

Another officer cooperating with the CID is Captain Roshan Dissanayake, with whom Navy Sampath had worked at the time he fled the country. When it was reported that the accused had neither gone to the CID on March 2 nor reported to his post until March 4, 2017, Dissanayake had requested that the Navy take disciplinary action against him, he told investigators. However, by the time the CID had asked the Navy to produce the accused for the second time, on March 31, 2017, he had left the naval service under mysterious circumstances. 
The CID also detailed several anecdotes that imply the further degree to which Wijegunaratne is suspected to have tried to obstruct the investigation. Navy Sampath was serving under the command of Rear Admiral Ananda Guruge at the time he left the naval service. When Guruge was asked to report to the CID on February 21, 2017 to record a statement, he had informed the investigators that he wasnt able to appear on that date as he had to take over duties in the Eastern Province. He instead undertook to visit the CID on March 5, 2018. 
Then, the CID received an unexpected letter dated March 5, 2018 from Navy Commander Wijegunaratne, informing them that Guruge is unable to come on that day and that he would come on March 12. The reasons were a mystery to both Guruge and the CID. Rear Admiral Guruge was not allowed to come to the CID even on March 12, and subsequently only cooperated with investigators after a new navy commander took office. 
Both Wijegunaratne and wartime Navy Commander Wasantha Karannagoda had made representations to President Maithripala Sirisena to quash the CID investigation on the basis that the eleven youth who were abducted were involved in terrorist activities, and that the abductions and murders thus constituted national security operations. 
It is learned that thereafter, President Sirisena had made inquiries with over a dozen agencies including the State Intelligence Service, the Terrorist Investigation Division, Colombo Crimes Division, Directorates of Naval, Air Force and Army Intelligence, CID, Special Task Force, Fraud Bureau and Crime Record Division, none of whom had any intelligence or information implicating any of the victims in any terrorism-related or even illegal activities. 
The most ironic twist in the case is that the abductions may have gone unsolved if not for a personal dispute that took place in 2009 between then Navy Commander Wasantha Karannagoda and his Personal Security Officer, Lt. Commander Sampath Munasinghe. According to Court documents, several Navy officers had inspected Munasinghes quarters on May 26, 2009, and discovered passports, national identity cards (NICs) and bank cards of several missing persons, as well as SIM cards, and live ammunition. The findings were followed by a written complaint made by the then Navy Commander Vice Admiral Wasantha Karannagoda to the CID two days later on May 28, 2009. 
The items recovered from the search included a passport bearing number N 1431844 of Stanley Lyon and four national identity cards (NIC) belonged to K. A. Anton (601772809 V), Thygarajah Jegan (790683021 V), Stanley Lyon (584201179 V) and S. A. Roshan (870232713 V) together with many other items including live ammunition cartridges, mobile phones, a credit card and SIM cards. Later, during the investigations it was revealed that the owners of these recovered items from Munasinghes quarters had gone missing in 2008. 
The wife of K.A. Anton, Samsudin Nihara, had confirmed with the CID that the NIC bearing number 601772809 V and the Bank of Ceylon Visa Credit Card bearing number 1051 7661 2000 5586 that was taken into custody from Sampath Munasinghes room belonged to her husband, Kasthuri Arachchige Anton was kidnapped on October 10, 2008. Nihara told investigators that her son Kasthuri Arachchige John Reed too had been abducted two months earlier on August 9, 2008. 

Ransom Demanded

Nihara had thereafter received calls from an unidentified person speaking in Tamil who had demanded a ransom of Rs. 1.5 million to release both her husband and son. She had only been able to pay five hundred thousand rupees. She had met the abductors and given them this sum on November 4, 2008 at a place in Narammala in Kurunegala, but her husband and son were never released and are presumed dead. 
It was the same fate that had befallen on Thyagarajah Parameshwari too. The NIC bearing the number 790683021V, and found at Sampath Munasinghes room, belonged to the 30-year-old Thyagarajah Jegan. Two months after his abduction, his mother Thyagarajah Parameshwari had received a call from one Annachchi, who had demanded Rs. 1 million to be paid as ransom within ten days to secure her sons release. The caller had allowed Jegan to talk to his mother and he had told her that he was detained at a Navy Camp. Later, the destitute mother had negotiated the ransom money down to eight hundred thousand rupees. However, she was ultimately able to collect only five hundred thousand rupees and that too after pleading with all her relatives to raise this money by selling their jewellery. They too had been asked to arrive at a place closer to Kurunegala and their monies were taken at gunpoint. Her son was never released, and is presumed dead. 
According to the B Report, Anthony Fernando a relative of Lyon had told the CID that he had come to know Stanley Lyon and Roshan Lyon had been detained in a Navy camp and that he received a call demanding a ransom of nine hundred thousand rupees to be paid to Navy Officer Dassanayake to secure the release of his kin. Although the family had agreed to pay the ransom, they were unable to contact Dassanayake to pay the money as Dassanayake had left the country on a training programme. These two NICs and the passport too had been found in Sampath Munasinghes room, and the men are presumed to have been executed. 
In subsequent facts reports to the Colombo Fort Magistrate (CASE NO: B 732/ 09), the CID has charged that an additional eleven youth were abducted from Elakanda, Dehiwela, Kochchikade, Colombo and Katunayake by Naval Intelligence officers on the directives of Lt. Com. Sampath Munasinghe and Navy Sampath. 
The names of the eleven missing youth are Kasthuriarachchilage John Reed, Rajiv Naganathan, Pradeep Vishvanathan, Thilakeshwaram Nagalingam, Mohamed Saajith, Jamaldeen Dilan, Amanon Lyon, Roshan Lyon, Antony Kasturiarachchi, Thiyagarajha Jegan and Mohomed Anver. 

It was later revealed that the abductors had wanted the parents of Rajiv Naganathan, one of the students, to pay a ransom of Rs. 10 million to release the children. This had been negotiated down to one million rupees. The abductors had told the Naganathan family that the money had to be paid to a Sampath, who was purportedly working closely with the Navy Commander
	Both Wijegunaratne and wartime Navy Commander Wasantha Karannagoda had made representations to President Maithripala Sirisena to quash the CID investigation on the basis that the eleven youth who were abducted were involved in terrorist activities, and that the abductions and murders thus constituted national security operations. It is learned that thereafter, President Sirisena had made inquiries with over a dozen agencies which included institutes like the State Intelligence Service, the Terrorist Investigation Division and Colombo Crimes Division
Five among these eleven, Rajiv Naganathan, Pradeep Vishvanathan, Thilakeshwaram Nagalingam, Mohamed Sajith and Jamaldeen Dilan, were abducted in Dehiwela while on their way to visit a friend on September 17, 2008. They were travelling on Rajiv Naganathas black car bearing the license plate WP KC 5569. 
According to the B Report, several Navy officers who have cooperated with the CID have painted a clear picture of the fate of these five youths. Commodore Udaya Keerthi Wijaya Bandara, who was a Consultant to the then Navy Commander, told sleuths that he was informed by Captain Jagath Jayantha Ranasinghe that Sampath Munasinghe had abducted five students from Dehiwela and demanded a ransom of one million rupees from each of the families to release these students. 
It was later revealed that the abductors had wanted the parents of Rajiv Naganathan, one of the students, to pay a ransom of Rs. 10 million to release the children. This had been negotiated down to one million rupees. The abductors had told the Naganathan family that the money had to be paid to a Sampath, who was purportedly working closely with the Navy Commander.
The CID has since recorded confessions from two Navy sailors Aluth Gedara Upul Bandara and Lakshman Udaya Kumara who had worked for Sampath Munsinghe and were directly involved in the abduction of these five youth. According to their statements, it was Munasinghe who had ordered them to abduct a group comprising five suspects that was coming to Badowita in Dehiwela. Once they had abducted the five suspects they handed them over to Munasinghe who had taken them in a white van. 
Both Upul Bandara and Lakshman Udaya Kumara had later changed their stories and given subsequent statements alleging that it was the then Director of Naval Intelligence, Ananda Guruge who had instructed them to give what they now call false statements implicating Sampath Munasinghe in the abduction. The CID told the magistrate that in their second statements, both Upul Bandara and Udaya Kumara had stated that it was in fact Navy Sampath not Munasinghe, who led the abduction team. It was Sampath Munasinghe that had allegedly instructed Navy Sampath to carry out the abduction. According to their statement, all the belongings of these five students had been taken over by Navy Sampath while the car in which they were travelling had been taken over by Lt. Commander Ranasinghe. Later, it was revealed that parts of this car had been found within the Navy base in Trincomalee, but had gone missing when the CID investigations began. 
The B Report reveals that a Navy informant Anver Ali was the person who had given a tip off to Sampath Munasinghe about the Naganathan family who were well off and that was why their son was abducted for ransom. Later Anver Ali too had been abducted by the same abductors and his fate too is not known as of today.
According to the reports, Rajiv Naganathan studied at Colombo International School and was to leave the country the following day to study medicine at a University in the United Kingdom. Anver Ali had got friendly with Rajiv through Saajith two days before he was abducted. Anver Ali had inquired about Rajivs fathers businesses and it was on their way to meet Ali that Rajiv and his friends were kidnapped by Navy Sampath on the instructions of Munasinghe. 
Several additional navy officers have cooperated with the CID and provided details of how the abducted youth were imprisoned in multiple naval facilities. These witnesses include Punchi Banda Ranatunge, Wimalaratne Siri Seneviratne, Ranhawadi Darayalage Priyankara, Nimal Jayaratne, Sampath Saman Kumara Abeykoon. Nalin Niroshana Marasinghe, Pradeep Herath Bandara, Lt. Com. C.K. Welagedara, Bandu Kumara, Pradeep Sudarshana Kumarasinghe and B.M. Wijekantha, all of whom were attached to the Naval Base at Trincomalee in 2008 and 2009. 

The names of the eleven missing youth are Kasthuriarachchilage John Reed, Rajiv Naganathan, Pradeep Vishvanathan, Thilakeshwaram Nagalingam, Mohamed Saajith, Jamaldeen Dilan, Amanon Lyon, Roshan Lyon, Antony Kasturiarachchi, Thiyagarajha Jegan and Mohomed Anver
These officers had confirmed the CID that the 11 abductees were kept at an underground prison cell at the Gunsight camp in the Trincomalee naval base. 
Another sailor, B. M. Wijayakantha alias Podi Malli (able seaman VAS 68653) told investigators that he knew that it was in fact Sumith Ranasinghe who executed the detainees at gunpoint, tied their lifeless bodies to concrete poles and threw them to the middle of the sea. 
Yet another sailor, Upul Bandara, told the CID that he recalled five students including Rajiv Naganathan being brought to the Navy Head Quarters from Dehiwela on the instructions of Lt. Com. Sampath Munasinghe, and that they were kept at a place called pittu bambuwa from August 2008 to April 2009 without being handed over to the police or produced in court. 
According to Lt. Com. Welagedaras statement, he had even seen a few Navy sailors loading dead bodies wrapped in polythene to the back of a double cab which indicates that these abductees had been killed at Gunsight underground prison. He also accused two other suspects, Cap. D.K.P. Dassanayake and Lt. Com. Sumith Ranasinghe of threatening him and Upul Bandara for giving evidence to the CID against them. 

Another sailor, B. M. Wijayakantha alias Podi Malli (able seaman VAS 68653) told investigators that he knew that it was in fact Sumith Ranasinghe who executed the detainees at gunpoint, tied their lifeless bodies to concrete poles and threw them to the middle of the sea.
However, Lt. Commander Sumith Ranasinghe had told the CID that he was informed by Navy Sailor Bandara that the five that had been abducted by Sampath Munasinghe had been killed and their bodies had been thrown to the Kelani River. He claimed that he did not have any hand in these abductions, but had only come to know that they were carried out by Navy Sampath and the then Navy Commander Karannagoda were well aware of what was happening. 
Prior to 2017, Hettiarachchi had told the CID that he and Munasinghe occupied the same quarters- Room No: 8 at the officers mess and that a Muslim informant frequently visited Munasinghe. The now fugitive had further asserted that he had never associated with any Muslim person nor had he detained people for questioning at any time, adding that the Navy has no authority to arrest people. He roundly refuted the allegations levelled against the Navy of abducting people for any reason. 
Seaman Ranhavadi Durayalage Priyankara (Navy Seaman VA 59652) told investigators that he worked under Lt. Com. Ranasinghe and that in the Naval base there were underground prisons where LTTE suspects were often detained. He said it was Ranasinghe who headed the Navy Special Intelligence Unit and that Rajiv Naganathan, Pradeep Vishwanathan, Dilan, Sajith, Ramalingam, Jegan, Amalin Lyon, Stanley Lyon, John Reet, Antony and even Ali Anvar who gave the tip off to abduct the five students were all detained in the underground Gunsight prison. He has also stated that he can identify those detainees if he sees them again. He identified all of them in the photographs that the CID had showed him and had confirmed that all of them were under Lt. Com. Ranasinghes custody. 
Meanwhile Wimalaweera Wickremasuriya (Navy Seaman XP 20844), Attanayake Mudiyanselage Ashoka Mahesh Kumara (Master Chief Petty Officer ED 26213), Jenul Abdeen Sherifdeen (Petty Officer VA 2552), Nalinda Niroshan Marasinghe (SC 44126) and Saman Kumara Abhayakoon (XS 45655) too in their statements have stated that they knew how people were abducted and kept in detention and how they were killed later by these Navy officers. 
As the CID investigation heated up in 2010, the CID leadership met with Defence Secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa and Chief of National Intelligence Major General Kapila Hendawitharana on June 15, 2010, to brief them on the case and the likelihood that several high ranking naval officers would be suspects in what appeared to be an abduction for ransom cum murder racket. 
According to correspondence and minutes by then CID Director M.K.D.W. Amarasinghe, Rajapaksa had ordered the CID to carry out a full investigation into these crimes and to keep him appraised of any progress and obstacles encountered by the investigators. Rajapaksa and Hendawitharana, who at the time were the countrys intelligence czars, had concluded that there were no national security grounds to justify these abductions, and wanted those responsible brought to justice. 
Former Chief of National Intelligence (CNI) Maj. Gen. Kapila Hendawitharana recalled the meeting in an interview with the Daily Mirror. General Hendawitharana confirmed that Rajapaksa did indeed order the CID to investigate these crimes and all instances of illegal abductions which took place under guise of purported threats to national security.

Coca-Cola Beverages Sri Lanka Ltd. joined hands with the Sri Lanka Red Cross Society - Gampaha Branch, to conduct a community flood relief operation across areas of Yabaraluwa, Mabima, Bollagala, Thelwatta, Pattiwila and Ambaraluwa within Biyagama, which were severely affected by the recent rains and flooding.

Commenting on the flood relief operations, Ruwan Abeywardene - Branch Executive Officer of Sri Lanka Red Cross Gampaha said,Vulnerablecommunities in theGampaha District once againsuffered during the recent floods due to the incessant rains. We are extremely thankful to Coca-Cola for continuing to support our within 24-hour emergency relief efforts in providing disaster relief operations annually.

Court again upholds the supremacy of Parliament
	
The Supreme Court had given two landmark rulings last week. Nonetheless it is not clear and too early to say whether Sri Lankan society at large or at least the people concerned in particular paid sufficient attention to them. One was the case filed against Ceylon Tobacco Company (CTC) for causing cancer to a man in which the court ordered CTC to pay 400,000 to the mans wife as cost as the CTC had delayed the case by appealing against an order made by the District Court where the case was being heard to the Appeal Court and theSupreme Court. 
In the second case, the court had rejected a fundamental right petition filed by former Chief Justice Sarath N. Silva challenging the enactment of the Provincial Councils Elections Amendment Bill. The Bill was originally supposed to provide for the inclusion of 30% of female candidates in the nomination papers tendered by political parties and independent groups at the provincial councils elections. But it was later amended by inclusion of sections providing for the introduction of a mixed electoral system for provincial councils, during the committee stage of the Parliamentary debate on it.
The Bill was passed in the Parliament on September 20 last year and the Speaker had given his assent to the Bill on September 22. Amidst controversy over the manner the government had introduced the Amendment to the original Bill, the former Chief Justice filed a fundamental rights petition at the Supreme Court seeking an interim order by way of a direction that the amendments made to the Bill shall not be operative till the final determination of his petition.
Before this Bill was presented in the Parliament another Bill - the 20th Amendment to the Constitution - to provide for holding elections for all provincial councils on the same day had been rejected by the Supreme Court on the grounds that certain Articles of the Amendment were inconsistent with the Constitution. (After its rejection the JVP has currently presented a Bill under the same name  20th Amendment to the Constitution - as a private members Bill for the abolition of the Executive Presidency) One of the reasons the court had cited for the rejection of it was that it would cause to delay the provincial councils elections. It was argued that the controversial amendments to the above Bill which Mr. Silva contested went against that ruling. 
Besides, the former Chief Justice argued that one page of the original Bill had been removed and 21 new clauses had been inserted making it a new Bill, at the committee stage. He had further argued that as it was a new Bill it had to be published in the gazette for the people who are the depository of franchise and legislative power. He did not contest the validity of the content of the controversial Amendment  the introduction of mixed electoral system- but contended that the manner in which it was passed was not appropriate. The Attorney General contended that the court has no power or jurisdiction to inquire into, or pronounce upon, the constitutionality of a duly presented Bill or its due compliance with the legislative process, on any ground whatsoever. Accordingly, the court rejected his petition. Thus, it has to be understood that no Bill that has been duly passed in the Parliament can be questioned. This ruling is important as it has once again upheld the supremacy of the Parliament. 
The elections for the provincial councils that already stands dissolved have been suspended and delayed as the said controversial Amendment necessitated creation of wards in each provincial council area under the mixed electoral system introduced by the Amendment. The mixed electoral system has run into a storm after the February 10 local government elections which were held under that system, since it had caused chaos in a majority of local councils and all parties that contributed in the formulation and the passage of it now want to change it. 
Had the court ruled otherwise, the government would have been compelled to hold the already suspended elections forthwith but it would have been a challenge to the supremacy of the Parliament. Though the franchise at provincial level has been compromised due to the controversial amendments, court has upheld it now at the national level.

23 dead, half a million hit in Indian floods
	

DPA, 18th JUNE, 2018- At least 23 people were killed and more than half a million people affected as floods driven by torrential monsoon rains ravaged Indias north-eastern states, officials and news reports said on Monday.
As many as 12 deaths were reported in drownings, landslides and electrocutions in the first wave of floods in Assam since last Wednesday, state disaster management official Suman Ahmed said.
Five of these deaths were reported over the weekend, he added.
An estimated 448,495 people were affected in Assam, including being displaced, stranded in their homes or suffering damage to their crops, land or livelihood.
Disaster management authorities were rescuing villagers from low-lying and inundated areas.
Eight flood-related deaths have been confirmed since mid-June from the neighbouring state of Manipur where over 200,000 people were affected, officials said.
Other states in the region were also hit by floods including Tripura, where three deaths were reported in the monsoon season, according to local media reports.
The situation was improving in Manipur and Tripura as rains eased on Monday, but thousands of homeless were still in state-run relief camps. Several areas remained cut-off due to landslides that had damaged roads.
Indias monsoon season between June and September often sees heavy rains that are vital for agriculture but can cause immense destruction.

Film distribution comes under Film Corporation from today
	
The distribution of local films, which was handled by four private companies, would come under the purview of the National Film Corporation with effect from today, National Film Corporation Chairman Sithendra Senaratne said.
Earlier the distribution of films was handled by the five agents, including the National Film Corporation, and four private companies, he said.
The final decision was taken by the board and also by the Ministry to take over the distribution of film distribution to the Corporation with immediate effect.
"President Maithripala Sirisena appointed a committee to look into the problems of the cinema sector and to identify issues and to recommend suitable remedies.
45 experts who involve in the entire cinema sector worked on the report and it was submitted to the President recently," he said.
"The President had directed to take necessary actions based on the recommendations made in the report.
The line Ministries were also working on it. Several discussions were held at the previous Public Administration and Management Ministry.
Series of meetings with all the stakeholders in the entire cinema sector and with the new line Ministry, the Higher Education and Cultural Affairs to take necessary remedies based on the recommendation," Senaratne said.
We had a meeting with film directors, producers, cinema owners and the associations of exhibitors. All of them were insisting. It was very hard to say that certain distribution companies were not doing their job properly and as a result, they have been penalised, he said.
Also, categorically said that they are not working with the distribution companies and they wanted the Corporation to exercise its strike based on 1971 film Corporation Act and to take over the film distribution and to have a fare system, which can safeguard the interest of the producers, directors and the cinema halls, he said.
During the press briefing held yesterday at the Corporation, we had informed all the distribution companies about our decision. The Corporation will take necessary steps to implement a new system on local film distribution. (Chaturanga Samarawickrama)

Half of state officials should be in jail by now: AG
	
More than half the state officials would be in jail by now if they were dealt in the manner in which former presidential secretary Lalith Weeratunga was dealt with and sentenced to prison on charges of misusing State funds, Auditor General Gamini Wijesinghe said yesterday.
Mr. Weeratunga was sentenced to prison for misusing public funds and if the other state officials are dealt with in a similar manner, half of them should serve jail terms because most of them spent funds without the approval of their superiors, he said at a workshop organized by COPA.
Mr. Wijesinghe said trillions of rupees had been wasted by various government institutions in the recent past while a huge amount of funds were wasted in the health sector for importing outdated equipment and money allocated for school buildings without making proper assessments.
He said there were some 1,500 students in the school he studied at but there were only 50 students in that school now. This is just an example as there are instances where funds are utilized to construct buildings in schools which did not have a sufficient number of students to use these facilities, he said.
Mr. Wijesinghe said only Rs.300 million out of Rs.1.2 billion allocated for capital expenditure has been allocated in the last budget and one director attached to Maga Neguma is claiming the company today. He said one stake was given to this director while other stakes were given to the government when Maganeguma was formed.
Mr. Wijesinghe said the bond scam was not the only financial crime in the country because there were many more including the coal power purchasing deal and the rice import scam which had taken place under the previous and the current government.
He said the Audit Bill was a must to ensure financial discipline in the State sector under the 19th Amendment to the Constitution but the government was unable to enact it as yet. COPA Chairman Lasantha Alagiyawanna said the Bill would be enacted within three months. (Yohan Perera and Ajith Siriwardana)

India-US relations come under  strain as ties with Russia develop
	

Indias reliance on Iran for oil, and on Russia for defense equipment, could be choked due to the unilateral sanctions by the US
	Russias share of arms imports falls from 79% between 2008-2012 to 62% in 2013-2017

Relations between India and the United States, which were on the upswing following the collapse of the Soviet Union and its aftermath, have now come under strain due to President Donald Trumps eccentric trade and defence policies.
After declaring India as a strategic defence partner in 2016, the US has been pressurizing India to snap its traditional defence ties with Russia and buy weapons systems from the US mainly.
Recently, when India decided to buy Russias S-400 surface-to-air missile units instead of the failed US PAC-3 interceptors, the US threatened to impose sanctions under the Countering Americas Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA).
CAATSA is a US federal law enacted in 2017 to impose sanctions on Russia, Iran and North Korea.
Recently, when Turkey rejected the PAC-3 and opted for S-400, the US threatened sanctions. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the House Foreign Relations Committee that the US was making efforts to keep the Turks in a place where they will never acquire the S-400.
Unilateral US sanctions have damaged Washingtons relations with the European Union and other parties to the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPoA) also.
However, Indias External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj told Parliament that India would go in for the Russian air defence system even if it attracted US sanctions. She pointed out that CAATSA could not be applied to India as it abides only by UN and not US sanctions.
And Defence Minister Nirmala Sitharaman told the media: In all our engagements with the US, we have clearly explained how India and Russias defence cooperation has been going on for a long time and that it is a time-tested relationship.
She added that India has received numerous defence assets from Moscow and that such cooperation would continue with the $ 5.5-billion S-400 deal.
Despite the US bid to capture the Indian arms market, Russia is still Indias largest arms supplier, accounting for 62 per cent of arms sales to New Delhi over the past five years, according to the Stockholm-based International Peace Institute (SIPRI).
It must be noted that S-400 is an advanced weapon system and it is virtually impossible for India to procure a comparable system from any other country. However, the bottom line is that some discernible shifts are there in the Indian foreign policy lately  one may say, a rethink or a course correction. India is asserting its strategic autonomy, former Indian Ambassador M. Bhadrakumar told Russia Today. According to experts, the S-400 Triumf is capable of firing three types of missiles to create a layered defense, and integrates a multi-function radar, autonomous detection and targeting systems, missile launchers and command posts. It can bring down aircraft at a range of up to 400km. On the other hand, the US PAC-3 has failed said expert Bharat Karnad in a piece in the The Citizen. The Trump administration is interested in selling to India, F-18 and F-16 fighter planes. The companies making them have offered to assemble these planes in India as part of Modis Make in India campaign. The US is also marketing 22 Sea Guardian Unmanned Aerial Systems for US$ 2 billion.
The ambitious Defense Technology and Trade Initiative (DTTI) is the key platform to elevate the Indo-US defense relationship from a buyer-seller engagement to a partnership model, to co-develop and co-produce key defense technologies, it is pointed out.
Of course, if implemented, these US schemes are advantageous to India. But the US cannot monopolize Indias purchases nor can it dictate what India can buy and from where. That has been made clear to Washington.
Buying from the US comes with lot of attached baggage. Just too many dos and donts, inclusive of the uncertainty attending on the spares supply, which can be stopped at any time on congressional whim and an administrations fancy. And worst of all, the PAC-3 does not work as advertised, Bharat Karnad points out.

Despite the US bid to capture the Indian arms market, Russia is still Indias largest arms supplier, accounting for 62 per cent of arms sales to New Delhi over the past five years, according to the Stockholm-based International Peace Institute (SIPRI)
JeopardizesIndo-Iran ties
US sanctions on Iran have put Indias interests in Iran in jeopardy. India is involved in the construction of the Chabahar Port which is a vital link to Central Asia. Iran is a significant source of oil for India. US sanctions will render the use of US dollars illegal by August 2018.
As India takes over the Chabahar Port under a lease agreement, the ramifications of the sanctions on Chabahar could result in banks backing out due to fear of US sanctions.
Indias reliance on Iran for oil, and on Russia for defense equipment, could be choked due to the unilateral sanctions by the US on various important entities, personalities and institutions in these countries, observers point out.
US-India trade war
India has decided to suspend trade concessions and raise import duties on 30 products from the US by up to 50% in a mirror response to Washingtons impetuous move to impose tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, a report said.
The new measures will see a 50 % tariff increase on motorcycles with engine capacities of over 800cc, while apple imports would be charged with a 25 % levy. Imports of almonds and walnuts would see a 20% levy. The total tariff increase on all products in the list will amount to an estimated additional US$ 240 million in import fees. The sum is roughly equivalent to the damage India would suffer from Donald Trumps protectionist measures, the report added.
Strengthening ties with Moscow
Meanwhile, India is building upon its relations with Moscow. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi met Russian President Vladimir Putin in Sochi in May and discussed Russias agreed weapons exports to India, estimated to be worth $ 12 billion.
Russias share of arms imports had fallen from 79 % between 2008-2012 to 62% in 2013-2017, according to SIPRI, causing concern in Moscow.
In a tweet sent out prior to his visit, Modi confirmed that he would seek to strengthen the special and privileged strategic partnership between India and Russia.
Prior to Modis visit, Indias National Security Advisor (NSA) Ajit Doval and the BJP leader Ram Madhav also visited Russia to strengthen political and security ties.
However, India and Russia have issues to thrash out. India had decided to quit the Sukhoi/HAL Fifth Generation Fighter Aircraft (FGFA) project, mooted for over a decade. New Delhi is apparently dissatisfied with both the timelines and the characteristics of what would have been a groundbreaking, jointly produced jet, and a new model for Russias post-Soviet aerospace industry, Russia Today said.
But there is cooperation in the nuclear field. Russia has completed nuclear reactors 3 and 4 at Kudankulam, Indias largest nuclear power station, and wants to complete reactors 5 and 6 by the start of the next decade.
The success of the (Kudankulam) project could determine the path of the countrys energy industry  a relevant concern for a rapidly growing economy, and a population that is expected to overtake Chinas within five years, Russia Today said.
Then there is the trilateral nuclear development project in Bangladesh, namely, the US$ 13 billion Rooppur Nuclear Power Plant, where Russian engineers will supply the technology and the Indian side will provide some of the financing and management, Russia Today added.
India dilutes importance of Quad
Meanwhile, India has diluted the importance of the Quad in its Indo-Pacific strategy. The Quad is a new group involving India, US, Japan and Australia, which is primarily meant to safeguard US and Japanese interests in the Indo-Pacific region.
Indias Ambassador to Moscow, Pankaj Saran had told The Hindu that the Quad is not central to Indias policy on the Indo-Pacific region. Modi would have assured Putin that India was not part of any US-led alliance directed against it. This should be music to the ears of the Chinese too.

IUSF protesters teargassed
	
The Polduwa Junction today turned into a mini battlefield after around 2,000 anti-SAITM protesters attempted to get past police barricades put up to prevent them from reaching the countrys supreme legislative bodyParliament.
The anti-SAITM protest, organized by the Inter University Students Federation (IUSF), was backed by the Inter University Bhikku Federation (IUBF) and the Medical Faculty Students Action Committee (MFSAC).
The students were demanding the Government to abolish the SAITM immediately and withdraw the proposed Kotelawala Defence University (KDU) Bill, allowing SAITM students to be enrolled at the KDU.
The protest march that began outside the University of Visual and Performing Arts in Colombo at around 11am was obstructed by police and the Anti-riot Squad at the Polduwa Junction with the use of water cannons and tear-gas.
The Anti-SAITM protesters struggled to gain ground and attempted to break through the barriers while the Anti-riot Squad attempted to disperse them by tear-gassing them for nearly 30 minutes.
Banners and placards demanding the government abolish the SAITM and empty tear-gas canisters were seen strewn all over the Polduwa Junction soon after the mini battle between the students and the law enforcement authorities.
The protesters vowed to continue with their protests until all attempts to establish another SAITM by changing just the name of the institution were scrapped by the government. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

Losses at State institutions exceed Rs.50 bn last year: Speaker
	
According to Finance Ministry reports, the losses incurred by State institutions last year had exceeded Rs.50 billion, Speaker Karu Jayasuriya said at a workshop organized by the Committee on Public Accounts (COPA) yesterday.
He said more than 40 per cent of the funds belonging to State institutions were wasted each year.
These funds if saved could be utilized for the betterment of the people and for development work, the Speaker said. Parliament has been able to carry out investigations and monitor State institutions to the desired level. There are more than 837 State institutions that were investigated by COPA last year. All these institutions have been monitored by COPA, Auditor General and Parliament. Only around 20 or maximum 100 institutions were monitored by COPA during the past. Currently, there is satisfactory progress by COPA.
He said State institutions were no longer able to spend public funds according to its whims and fancies because they were being monitored by new systems put into place by the committees such as COPA and COPE.
COPA's main objective is to avoid misuse of funds, the wastage and the eradication of corruption. Earlier one could find out about corruption only when a complaint or a petition was filed by someone but it is not the case now and State institutions are constantly monitored. You dont have to go behind thieves now with the process carried out by the House to monitor institutions as it is possible to uncover a theft, a weakness and shortcomings could be overcome, the Speaker said.
He said the Right to Information Act (RTI) also helped maintain transparency in public spending. (Yohan Perera and Ajith Siriwardana)

Merkel given two weeks to reach EU deal on migrants
	

REUTERS, 18th JUNE, 2018-
Bavarias Christian Social Union (CSU) on Monday gave German Chancellor Angela Merkel two weeks to reach a European deal on migrants before they would demand immigration curbs that could fracture her governing coalition.
The CSU leadership agreed on Monday to delay until after a June 28-29 European Union summit the introduction of an entry ban for refugees who have already registered in other EU countries, allowing Merkel time to reach a multilateral deal.
Merkel opposes any unilateral move by German Interior Minister Horst Seehofer, who is also CSU chairman, that would reverse her 2015 open-door policy on migrants and undermine her authority. Mondays compromise means he can introduce immediate expulsion for one subset of migrants.
We wish the chancellor much luck, Seehofer told a news conference in Munich, announcing that he would nonetheless issue orders for people who have already been expelled to be turned back at the borders.
