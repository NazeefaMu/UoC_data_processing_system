Allegations malicious and baseless: Kabir
	
Some activists of civil organizations were making baseless allegations misusing the freedom of expression ushered in by the incumbent Government, Highways Minister Kabir Hashim said.
Those allegations against me were malicious and baseless, he said.
Today they have the freedom to make allegations. But there should be a base for these allegations. I am sorry to state that those activists as well as media, which publicise these allegations, should ascertain the veracity of the information published, he said.
He said that he worked as the Minister of Higher Education up to March 2015 under the 100-Day Programme and Dr Sarath Amunugama was appointed as the Minister of Higher Education on March 22, 2015, by the President.
Meanwhile, on June 19, the Board of Directors of the University Grants Commission decided to channel the investments through National Savings Bank. At that time the Minister of Higher Education was Dr Sarath Amunugama. Not me. The decision was taken by the University Grants Commission.
Therefore as blamed by an activist I have no connection at all with these matters and clearly I must say that this allegation was baseless, he said.
He said that the UGC was blamed by the COPE Committee and a system was introduced in 2013 for the UGC to make such investments.
They have done it under the instructions of the Attorney General, he said.
The Minister then asked the media to publicise the frauds occurred before the Yahapalana Government.
Reveal the frauds committed by companies like Entrust, which defrauded over Rs. 12 billion. Out of that Rs. 2,500 million was taken from the Central Bank Pensioners Fund and another 2,500 million from Ceylon Electricity Board Pensioners Fund, the Minister said.

An unshaken mind
	

These eight worldly conditions revolve around the world, and the world revolves around these eight worldly conditions. What eight Gain and loss, disrepute and fame, blame and praise, and pleasure and pain.

Human life is comparable to a flowing river. It initially starts off as a small stream. This small stream meets numerous challenges, obstacles, and barricades before it flows down and meets the great ocean. 
The path of the stream is not easy and not always clear, but full of difficulties and sometimes with blockages. Somehow it will never return nor revert to the origin and inception. The dream and prospect of the small stream is to meet the great ocean. Till its conclusion it keeps flowing day by day. Ultimately a small stream embraces the great ocean as a large river.

Likewise, there are eight vicissitudes and asperities in our lives. I call them LIFE CHALLENGES. 
Once the Buddha said thus: 
These eight worldly conditions revolve around the world, and the world revolves around these eight worldly conditions. What eight Gain and loss, disrepute and fame, blame and praise, and pleasure and pain.
No one is capable of avoiding them and escaping from them, nobody can get away from any of them and nobody can flee from them all. Meeting all of them is obvious. Even renowned Masters, both the Gautama Buddha and the Jesus Christ met these challenges. Their tolerance and endurance are incomparable. To overcome and conquer these challenges we need to train and tame our minds. Generally untrained and untamed minds are shaken, agitated, distressed and trembled. 
Purification and training of the mind are very important to have peace within. As much as and as long as you train your mind you will be able to perceive and comprehend the positive improvement and efficacious outcome of your own dedication. 
You may spend hundreds and thousands of your own currencies to make yourself happy and comfortable. But, will you be really HAPPY
Until you train and tame your mind to have that unshakable capability and efficiency, you would not be able to achieve innermost peace and happiness. 
Everyone prefers to embrace only positive factors, but no one is fortunate enough only to receive the positive factors. All of us are reluctant to encounter negative factors and no one wishes to accept any unsatisfactory vicissitudes of human life.

Purification and training of the mind are very important to have peace within
	
	Karma is a very important and fundamental teaching in Buddhism
	
	We should train and tame our minds to accept both negative and positive worldly conditions
	
	Most life factors are completely depended on and determined by our previous karma

Karma is a very important and fundamental teaching in Buddhism. Though most of us talk and write about it, we have not comprehensively and practically understood it. Ones own life is a classic and pragmatic example thatll help understand this fact.
We all have carried out both wholesome and unwholesome karma in our previous lives and in this very life. Unwholesome karma originates from the roots of craving, hatred, and delusion while wholesome karma originates from the roots of non-craving, non-hatred and non-delusion. These prime volitions and foremost intentions are the originators of karma and all the pleasant and unpleasant situations we experience at present are the consequences of lingering karma. 
People try their utmost to avoid unpleasant situations, but there is no way or any avenue to elude from asperity. Some may even blame others and hold responsibility for the incidents or the phenomenon, but the reality and the truth are utterly different.
You are responsible for yourself. No one is accountable or liable for deeds committed by others. When one is engaged in verbal, physical and mental activities one must be very careful and conscious of ones own intention and outcome. If the intention is good and pure, then the result will be very comfortable and congenial. If the volition is impure and immoral, then the consequences would be very unpleasant and grave.
Once Gautama Buddha said that these eight worldly conditions revolve around the world, and the world revolves around these eight worldly conditions. This universal law always exists in this world. Unfortunately as unenlightened people we are not yet ready and wise enough to understand this. 
Twenty six centuries ago, during the Buddhas time, one of the youth from a wealthy and affluent family by the name of Subha asked the Blessed One, the Buddha about the disparity of our human society.
Master Gautama, what is the cause and condition why human beings are seen to be inferior and superior For people are seen to be short-lived and long-lived, sickly and healthy, ugly and beautiful (pleasant and unpleasant), uninfluential and influential, poor and wealthy, low-born and high-born, unwise and wise (unintelligent and intelligent)
Student, beings are owners of their actions, heirs of their actions; they originate from their actions, are bound to their actions, have their actions as their refuge. It is action that distinguishes beings as inferior and superior.
The Buddha descriptively has expounded and elucidated exposition of karma to the young student Subha in The Shorter Exposition of Action (Culakammavibhanga Sutta)
Once the Buddha said:
Bhikkhus, greed is a source and origin of karma; hatred is a source and origin of karma: delusion is a source and origin of karma. With the destruction of greed, a source of karma is extinguished. With the destruction of hatred, a source of karma is extinguished. With the destruction of delusion, a source of karma is extinguished.
Bhikkus, there are these four kinds of karma proclaimed by me after I realized them for myself with direct knowledge.
What four
There is dark karma with dark result; there is bright karma with bright result; there is dark-and- bright karma with dark-and-bright result; and there is neither dark nor bright with neither-dark-nor-bright result, karma that leads to the destruction of karma. These are the four kinds of karma proclaimed by me after I realized them for myself with direct knowledge.
Bhikkhus, what is the dark karma with dark result
Here, someone performs an afflictive bodily volitional activity, an afflictive verbal volitional activity, an afflictive mental volitional activity. As a consequence, he is reborn in an afflictive world. When he is reborn in such a world, afflictive contacts touch him. Being touched by afflictive contacts, he feels afflictive feelings, exclusively painful, as in case of hell beings. This is called dark karma with dark result..
We meet all vicissitudes of life and worldly conditions from birth to death. They are unavoidable and inescapable factors. Some unwise and unmindful people fabricate and concoct false stories to obliterate and disrepute some innocent and reputed characters. While victims are traumatized by the fabrications as a result of their own previous conducts, those who design and fabricate false accusations and wrongdoings would accumulate unwholesome energy.
We should train and tame our minds to accept both negative and positive worldly conditions at all times. These eight vicissitudes and asperities of life are not permanent and everlasting. They are subject to change and are uncertain. When we have positive factors such as gain, fame, praise and pleasure we should not be elated and intoxicated because nothing is permanent.
Most life factors are completely depended on and determined by our previous karma. All capabilities and abilities are inherited according to our previous propensities and proclivities. In brief, it is karma and outcome of karma. ( karmma vipaka)  cause and effect.
Following profound words of Gautama Buddha will help you to properly understand the true nature of the life and importance of an unshaken mind.

The fools worry, thinking, I have sons, I have wealth.Indeed, when he himself is not his own, whence are sons, whence are wealth
May all beings be well and happy!

(The writer is the founder of Samadhi Buddhist Meditation Centre,AUSTRALIA)

Battle of Silence shows promise for an annual cricket series
	
It was indeed a historic day for The School for the Deaf and Blind, Ratmalana and the Nuffield School for the Deaf & Blind, Kaithadi when they played their inaugural softball cricket match on June 15 at Kaithadi. 
This opportunity not only promoted the spirit of sportsmanship between the two Schools, but also friendship and camaraderie. There was great inter-racial, inter-religious and inter-cultural bonding among the students as well as the teachers. They were able to observe the different cultures and enjoy the delicious food they were served with. This was the main objective of the organisers of the match and it was fulfilled beyond measure because they interacted
very closely. 
Two 10 over matches were played, with Nuffield School winning both. After the two matches were played, the organisers conducted another 10 over cricket match, with one team consisting of students from both Schools and the other team comprising teachers from both schools. 
The organisers of the match in a statement state that they wish to make this an annual event. The next encounter of this series will be played at Ratmalana. 
Everyone had a gala time and the team from Ratmalana left for Colombo on the15th night.

Blood is thicker than water
	

A big row was bedeviling the Pohottuwa in the recent past. It was a stalwart from a political party in Gampaha who had set the ball rolling.

In fact, it was this row that deprived the Katana doctor madam of the deputy chair of the Diyawanna council.
The dispute over whom the party should field as their candidate at the upcoming big poll is said to have led to this row in the party. When one faction was insisting that B of the R-family be groomed as the party candidate, another faction had steadfastly maintained that none other than G of the same family should fill the bill. The dispute had given way to such bad blood between them, they had even resorted to hurling innuendoes at one another from public platforms. The situation for the JO had taken a turn for the worse, when some of them had turned their guns on the Group of 16 as well.
Meanwhile, the former strongman who was quietly watching the growing ruckus in his brand-new party, had decided to call a haltto it. He got his sister to organize an evening party followed by a grand dinner exclusively for the five siblings of the R-family. The siblings at this dinner party had taken a collective decision following a lengthy discussion. This decision, a top secret, is not known to anyone outside the family, they say.
However, R-loyalists safely presume that the siblings have once again confirmed the maxim, that blood is thicker than water!

Chinese funds financed MR's election campaign: NY Times
	
During the 2015 presidential election, large payments from the Chinese Port Construction Fund flowed directly to campaign aides and activities of former president Mahinda Rajapaksa, who had agreed to Chinese terms at every turn and was seen as an important ally in Chinas efforts to tilt influence away from India in South Asia, The New York Times reported in an article published on June 25.
The article said the payments were confirmed by documents and cash checks detailed in a government investigation seen by the New York Times.
The article published by Maria Abi-Habib of The New York Times said though Chinese officials and analysts had insisted that Chinas interest in the Hambantota Port was purely commercial, Sri Lankan officials said from the start, the intelligence and strategic possibilities of the ports location were part of the negotiations.
Initially moderate terms for lending on the port project became more onerous as Sri Lankan officials asked to renegotiate the timeline and add more financing. And as Sri Lankan officials became desperate to get the debt off their books in recent years, the Chinese demands centered on handing over equity in the port rather than allowing any easing of terms. Though the deal erased roughly $1 billion in debt for the port project, Sri Lanka is now in more debt to China than ever, as other loans have continued and rates remain much higher than from other international lenders, The New York Times reported .
At least US$7.6 million was dispensed from China Harbours account at Standard Chartered Bank to affiliates of Mr. Rajapaksas campaign, according to a document, seen by The Times, from an active internal government investigation.
With 10 days to go before polls opened, around US$3.7 million was distributed in checks: US$678,000 to print campaign T-shirts and other promotional material and US$297,000 to buy supporters gifts, including womens saris. Another US$38,000 was paid to a popular Buddhist monk who was supporting Mr. Rajapaksas electoral bid, while two checks totalling US$1.7 million were delivered by volunteers to Temple Trees, his official residence.

Coming events cast a shadow
	

Purohita Diga from the estate domain took the initiative to set up a housing scheme for estate workers in the gem-rich district.

Given the general polls round the corner, the Green party madam raised to top team status, took great pains to turn the opening of the housing scheme into a grand event. She got her followers to put up pandals and festoon the area to turn it gay and colourful for the occasion.
However, the organizers had failed to send an invitation on time to the Diyawanna member ruling the roost in the area. On receiving an invitation to the event only at the eleventh hour, an affronted Diyawanna member had returned it to the organizers and on the day of the opening ceremony, got his faithfuls to turn away those arriving for the event. On hearing that Purohita Diga and those accompanying him were prevented from attending the proposed venue of the ceremony, the Green madam too kept away in case her arrival could lead to an ugly situation.
By the way, the Diyawanna member who prevented the event from taking place is reportedly planning to open the housing scheme himself shortly.
The rivalry over manape is the root cause for this incident, they say.

Euro four aims to check environment pollution
	

ABS is a more suitable technology that aids effective and efficient driving
	
	The Government has also given ample time for the people to embrace this technology
	
	The first Euro Standard was introduced in 1994
	
	The local existing fuel does not have much impact on the lifetime of these engines. We have to improve the local refinery
	
	The move by the Government to impose the stringent requirement in terms of emission and safety features is coming together

The number of vehicles on the roads has increased drastically in recent times increasing the pollution level. Therefore, the Government in a bid to decrease the emission level has decided to import vehicles compatible with the Euro four standards, commencing July 1. Imported diesel and petrol vehicles meeting the Euro 4 emissions standard will replace the existing Super Diesel and Petrol vehicle stocks in the market. 

This is why we need to implement Euro 4, automobile engineer Dr S.D.R Perera said. 
He was a Senior Lecturer of the Department of Mechanical Engineering Automobile Lab at the Open University of Sri Lanka. 
People are polluting the environment and therefore we should take certain measures to control emissions, he said. 
Concerns have been raised regarding heavy pollution. Scientists have also recommended that it is fitting to impose emission standards for vehicles, he said. 
The first Euro standard was introduced in 1994. In 1992 there was a restriction on carbon monoxide (CO), hydrocarbons (HC), nitrogen oxides (NOx), and particulate matter (PM). Euro 2 came in 1996 which was followed by Euro 3 in 2000 and Euro 4 in 2005. 

The Govt. mentioned that importing vehicles should be compatible with the Euro 4 standards

The main difference when it comes to Euro 4 is that it contains low levels of sulfur, he said. 
Older vehicle manufactures, prior to the enforcement of vehicle standards, are not required to comply with these regulations at the moment. However, customers are in a dilemma as to if it would affect the operation of older vehicles. 
Vehicles which are not designed under Euro 4 standards should either retrofit with new engines or modify with arc treatment system. This decision should be taken by law makers, he said. 
However, it is unfair to ask someone who has already bought a vehicle which does not comply with the Euro 4 standards to upgrade the vehicle and meet the Euro 4 emission standards. 
Still most of the vehicles brought to the country comply with the Euro 4 standards if they were bought from the domestic market. But the vehicles manufactured specifically for certain countries might not comply with this standard. 
During the Budget, the Government specifically mentioned that importing vehicles should be compatible with the Euro 4 standards with safety facilities such as airbags and three-point seat belts from July 1. The Government also informed vehicle importers not to open Letters of Credit (LCs) with effect from July 1, 2018. 
But this does not mean that vehicle owners who had imported their vehicles previously should fix new engines or other treatment systems to comply with Euro 4.
Most of the new vehicles imported to the country from the domestic market from Japan or Europe comply with Euro 4 and those vehicles are in operation. Those vehicles have not experienced fuel related problems. 

The Government also informed vehicle importers not to open Letters of Credit (LCs) with effect from July 1, 2018

One point which people seek clarification on is if they had imported Euro 4 complying vehicles, whether the fuel available in Sri Lankan refueling stations meets the requirement of Euro 4 That guarantee has to be given by the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC), Dr Perera said. 
As far as the fuel is concerned, there is a requirement to reduce the sulfur content, which heavily contributes to acid rains. There are also carcinogenic compounds included in the fuel, such as benzene, which is known as a cancer-causing substance. 
Under Euro 4 standard regulations the content of benzene should be very low, he said. 
If we talk about the technology that is being used in Euro 4, currently diesel vehicles are manufactured with Common Rail Direct Injection (CRDI) system. Most of the European luxury vehicles, which come with the CRDI technology, would help to reduce the exhaust and noise emissions with better fuel efficiency, Dr Perera said. 
The local existing fuel does not have much impact on the lifetime of these engines. We have to improve the local refinery. The Government should be able to provide fuel at a reasonable price and there should be a continuous supply across the country. 
The move by the Government to impose the stringent requirement in terms of emission and safety features is coming together. As a scientist, an engineer and a citizen of this country, I say that this is the right time to switch to the new technology. The Government has also given ample time for the people to embrace this technology, he said. 

VIASLs vision
Meanwhile, the Vehicle Importers Association of Sri Lanka (VIASL) said the Euro 4 quality certificate was a protection convention that was introduced in 2005. 

What is this ABS 
It is a technology used to prevent the locking of one wheel or many wheels during the sudden application of brakes by observing the speed of the wheels. (Anti-lock Breaking System). It is liable to happen during accidents when the vehicle cannot be controlled due to locking of the wheel or many wheels during an application of brakes. 

How does ABS work 
ABS is a vital part of any new cars safety equipment, and effectively boosts braking. ABS uses electronics to detect and prevent wheel lock up. This helps a driver maintain the control of the vehicle because a steering of the car will still work when ABS is engaged. ABS gradually appeared as a safety feature in new cars from the 1970s on wards, while EU law has made it compulsory on all cars built since 2004. 
A vehicle can be stopped within a short distance if the unnecessary wearing of tyres is minimised.
It is an effective technology that there are no failures found in it. ABS is a more suitable technology for an effective and efficient running for a driver who expects an activity without unnecessary wear and tear and wastage despite the fact that a vehicle can be stopped even without ABS technology, by using normal application of brakes. 
The system of wearing belts only for the hip, introduced by FORD Company in 1955 and 1956, can be underscored as the origin of the seat belt protection technology. It was reintroduced in 1967 for VOLVO motor vehicles for front and rear seats as well and later in 1972, VOLVO Company introduced a more protective seat belt technology for three places connected to the vehicle. Since then, it has been introduced as a protective technology. 

Three-point seat belts work 
As a passenger in a vehicle moves his body according to the speed of the vehicle, the speed reduces due to abrupt application of brakes. Then, it is absorbed by the tyres which are connected to the earth and the friction and shock absorber by releasing the shocking power. When the passenger is liable to be thrown forward due to the speed of the vehicle (That is why the passengers goes forward during an abrupt application of brakes) , the seat belts help them to be tied to the vehicle on three spots. It goes to prove that Sri Lankans have not given the value of life to the passengers because the seat belts used in vehicles imported to Sri Lanka in 2018 lack safety. 

Air bag 
This is the technology used to minimize the accidents that are caused to drivers and passengers by friction with the other parts of the vehicles in case of an accident.

The importance of an air bag is stressed because it has been made compulsory in every developed country in the world. 
Having taken into consideration the steps taken in 2018 or many years ago after giving priority to the protection of the peoples lives, it has to be assessed in terms of human protection for which co-operation has to be extended by all those concerned because the people feel strongly about protection in an undeveloped country like ours.

Most of the new vehicles imported to the country from the domestic market from Japan or Europe comply with Euro 4

As Sri Lanka march forward as a developed country; the protection of the passengers is her right. The development or progress of the developed countries in the world is measured not only in terms of economy or money in that particular country; there are many factors that have to be considered in this regard. In simple terms, development means a fact that a state has built a surrounding where people can live comfortably, with confidence and safely; it is a sign of development as well. 
According to experts, it affects the vehicle market adversely. Their opinion is that the people should think in terms of their protection rather than travelling in a low cost vehicle. People did not discuss about a right of travelling with security. However, fortunately it can be treated that the people in our country have gained a victory in this regard.

From Ubiquity to Immaculacy
	

Khema the Arahant Bhikkhuni, foremost in wisdom is an outstanding example
	
	Traversing the earth and heavens again for an entire Buddha epoch, in Gautama Buddhas time she was born to a royal family in Sagala City


The ultimate transcendental state of Arahanthood is of such rarity that its accomplishment is almost always preceded by Nekkhamma  going from home to homelessness, a process to be cultivated through a numberless rounds of births. Every norm in the world though has it exception, and so it is with this rule as well. Buddhist literature counts just a handful of instances where laymen and women reached that exalted state, rendered all the more sensational by their paucity. Their achievements are remarkable considering the fact that the obstacles they have to surmount in their lay state are far more formidable than of those gone forth.`
Khema the Arahant Bhikkhuni, foremost in wisdom is an outstanding example. Her narrative as in others of similar tenor originates in the era of Piyamathura Buddha when she was born a slave girl. On seeing Piyamathura Buddhas First Chief Disciple Sujatha on his alms - begging round offered him three sweetmeats. The same day she sold her only possession in the world, her lock of hair to buy the Great Arahants mid-day meal. While offering it to him she made a prayer that some day she too become a wise one like him. Thenceforth transmitting between human and deva worlds a hundred thousand eons she became one of seven daughters of the Kasi King Kiki in Kashyapa Buddhas dispensation. Her name was Samani. All seven sisters remained unmarried for twenty thousand years, came together to build a dwelling place for the use of Kashyapa Buddha.
Traversing the earth and heavens again for an entire Buddha epoch, in Gautama Buddhas time she was born to a royal family in Sagala City known for its beautiful maidens and was named Khema, whose complexion was a golden hue. Her six other siblings became Arahant bhikkhunis Uppalawanna, Patachara, Prajapathi Gothami, Dhammadinna, Baddha Kundalakesi and the sowan attainee Visakha.

Their achievements are remarkable considering the fact that the obstacles they have in their lay state are far more formidable than of those gone forth

Come of age, Khema was sent to the palace of King Bimbisara of Rajagaha as his queen. Intoxicated with her own beauty, she never did visit Lord Buddha lest he speaks demeaningly of her good looks, as He always did in respect of superficial appearance. 
King Bimbisara reflected, the chief carer, the Arya Srawakas wife never visits the Lord, and it is not to my liking, so he arranged for royal musicians to sing the praises of Weluwana park to be heard by the queen. When she finally expressed her desire to pay a visit, the king hinted she may have to meet the Blessed one living there. She ignored the remark. 
When she was getting ready to leave the park without visiting Buddha the royal guards directed her towards Him on the monarchs orders. When she came close enough Buddha created the stunning image of a celestial nymph fanning Him from behind, to be visible only to her. I am finished, such heavenly creatures are attending on the great figure, I am not fit to be their maid. I am finished by my foul thoughts she told herself. While she stood transfixed by the fascinating spectacle unfolding before her, Buddha made the divine creature progressively reach middle age and finally become an old woman with grey hair and broken, dislodged teeth. In front of dumbfounded Khema she dropped on the floor with the fan still in her hand. Driven by her previous blessings she contemplated on her own future if the fate of the superlative being was this. At that moment the Blessed One uttered the verse found in Dhammapada,

Come of age, Khema was sent to the palace of King Bimbisara of Rajagaha as his queen. Intoxicated with her own beauty, she never did visit Lord Buddha lest he speaks demeaningly of her good looks, as He always did in respect of superficial appearance.

The spider perishes in the web it weaves, the greedy one perishes in the web of Samsara. With jettisoned expectations and sense desires one lives the holy life of sainthood.
Upon these words Khema attained in the very place where she stood, the holiest of holy states along with the four supernormal faculties. A layman or woman on reaching Arahanthood either passes away the same day or enters the clerical order. Realizing her life span is yet unexhausted, she paid her worshipful respects to the Blessed One and returned to the palace but did not worship the king. The sharp king knew instinctively that she had reached the journeys end. He addressed her, Queen, did you see the Blessed One she replied the Sowan Attainer, Great King, the Buddha I saw is quite unlike the mere glimpse you had of Him. May you approve of my admission to the Bhikkhuni order
The king had her conducted in a procession to a Bhikkhuni centre. The narrative in Anguttara Nikaya ends there. On a later date while at Jetawanaramaya Buddha designated Khema foremost amongst the wise in Bhikkhuni order, the culmination of her wish made many millions of years before.
Baddha Kundalakesi episode is equally sensational. She too made a prayer before Piyamatura Buddha that she be the one who comprehends Dhamma the fastest before a future Buddha. She too was born a sister of Khema in Kashyapa Buddhas dispensation, and in Gautama Buddha era she became a noblemans daughter. On seeing a notorious robber born on hora nekatha being whipped through the streets on the way to the execution ground, she insisted on threat of suicide that her parents have the condemned man saved from the spike. 
The parents contrived to swap another man with the robber and have him married to the girl. True to his stars, being fed up with marriage in no time he lured her to the edge of a cliff on the pretext of performing a ritual to appease the mountain god, but to finish her off and vanish with her jewellery.
She said to herself Wisdom was not meant to be cooked and eaten but to be used in situations like this, and finding a moment her husband was off guard flung him down the precipice. It is said the forest dwelling gods (wana devata) applauded the show of feminine skill. Unable to return to her parents thereafter, she entered a Nigantha hermitage, mastered their philosophy in no time and started roaming the country challenging anyone to a debate, when she met her match in Ven. Sariputta the first chief disciple. Having had all her arguments demolished and failing to answer the one question thrown at her by the utterly learned Bhikkhu, she pleaded pupillage under him.

There is no purpose in following me, the First Person in the World is in the temple nearby, be a follower of His. Accepting his advice in reverential gratitude she visited Buddha

The great monk replied, There is no purpose in following me, the First Person in the World is in the temple nearby, be a follower of His. Accepting his advice in reverential gratitude she visited Buddha in the evening during sermon  time, worshipped Him and stood to a side. No sooner Buddha pronounced the dictum The single word that calms the mind, holds sway over a thousand verses of empty rhetoric in consonance with her life of subdued desires, she attained in the very place she was as did Bhikkhuni Khema, the foremost state of spiritual and intellectual sublimity along with the four ultimate powers. Buddha accordingly designated her the one with ability to comprehend Dhamma in the quickest time among the Bhikkhuni order.
Chief Minister Santhathi who attained Arahanthood while still in military regalia occupies a unique position in the canon by way of contradictions, in a sense. Unlike the Bhikkhunis above, his life came to an end the very day he reached Arahanthood. He was inebriated a whole week in celebration of his quelling an uprising that erupted in the provinces, but was devastated when the dancing girl assigned to him came to a sudden death.
The liquor he consumed for seven days evaporated like drops of water on a red-hot plate. He went to Jetawanaramaya with an entire battalion to meet Buddha and beg help. Buddha explained he had come to the right person to uproot his sorrow and that the tears he had shed on account of this same woman is greater than the waters of the four oceans. 
On delivery of a short homily, the minister attained Arahanthood, still in his decorated uniform. Realizing his life had come to an end, the Arahant sought permission from Buddha to pass into parinirvana. On Buddhas advice he rose to the sky to recount his Kamma for the benefit of the multitude of people gathered. He recalled how ninety one kalpas before in the era of Vipassi Buddha as a layman he roamed the streets of Bandumathie his entire life of eighty thousand years extolling the virtues of the Triple Gem. At the end of the fascinating narrative, imbibing the fire element Tthejo dathu), his body ignited and became a ball of fire while still in the air. The ashes that fell were enshrined in Stupas on the four main cross-roads of the city as directed by the Blessed one.
The other noble personage who attained the exalted state was none other than the Great King Suddhodana himself. They all illumined the upasaka upasika sectors of Sri Gautama Buddha Sasana as did none other in the entirety of its twenty five century old
glorious history.

Glyphosate without adjuvants not very useful : Prof. Sarath Gunathilake
	
Prof. Sarath Gunathilake

Manufacturers have added these toxic chemicals into Glyphosate and nobody is talking about them! Over the last 25 years, the pesticide industry had us hoodwinked by referring only to Glyphosate and not to the adjuvants

Its a concern which divides governments, scientists and NGOs across the world, yet Glyphosate has the worlds highest production volumes of all commercial herbicides. The concerns over Glyphosate being a probable carcinogenic, among others, have not deterred agrochemical lobbyist and scientists from deeming it safe for commercial agriculture. Should consumers still be apprehensive about this weedicide
Professor Sarath Gunatilake M.D., Dr. P.H of California State University, Long Beach, California broached the subject of various health aspects relating to Glyphosate at a guest lecture organised by the Sri Lanka Medical Association recently. The discussion explored Glyphosate Based Herbicides (GBH), Chronic Kidney Disease and cancer, elaborating on the current evidence and the possible implications of using GBH within the tea industry.
Prof. Sarath Gunathilake believes that the debate on Glyphosate has typically been limited to the discussions of the active principle in herbicides and pesticides which is Glyphosate. Its important to remember that when talking about a herbicide or pesticide, youre not only talking about the active principle, but also about something we call adjuvants or added chemicals, he said. Adjuvants play a pivotal role in herbicide formulations and spray mixtures to improve the herbicides performance.
If you put a drop of Glyphosate on to a leaf, it will just slip off. But in order to make Glyphosate stick on the leaf while intensifying its actions, manufacturers of herbicides have added adjuvants, which are one thousand times more toxic than Glyphosate itself, he revealed.
Prof. Gunathilake went on to present his audience with an experiment conducted to establish effects of Glyphosate and the role of adjuvants. In this controlled experiment, a number of tomato plants were treated with pure Glyphosate and three different commercial brands of Glyphosate with adjuvants. According to the experiment, the plants treated with adjuvants began to whither in 72 hours. In 120 hours, all plants treated with the commercial Glyphosate brands died while the plant treated with pure Glyphosate was alive.
It is imperative we understand that the discussion on Glyphosate has been limited to talking about the active ingredient and not about these toxic chemicals. The point Im trying to raise is that Glyphosate without adjuvants is not very useful. Therefore, manufacturers have added these toxic chemicals into Glyphosate and nobody is talking about them! Over the last 25 years, the pesticide industry had us hoodwinked by referring only to Glyphosate and not to the adjuvants or additives included in these herbicides, the professor said.

What is Glyphosate and how does it work
Glycine is one of the simplest amino acids in our body. According to Prof. Gunatilake, agrochemical manufacturers have replaced one of the hydrogen atoms in Glycine, with a phosphate molecule. Monsanto, the company which created the chemical, came up with a very clever argument that Glycine is an amino acid present in the human body and phosphate is present plentifully in our skeletons. The addition of two ingredients that are already present in the human body is totally nontoxic, they said. Its a clever argument, but it is not the truth! Prof. Gunatilake charged. What happens in the synthesis of enzymes is that Glycine phosphate gets included by error. Instead of Glycine, we now have Glyphosate entering into the equation. This way Glyphosate has poisoned so many enzyme systems in our body.
Glyphosate chelates or binds most chemicals and some of its first known uses were to clean blockades in lead pipes with calcium and magnesium deposits. In 1970, Monsanto realised the importance of Glyphosate and registered it as a weed-killer. Within 10-15 years, Glyphosate became the worlds most used, most prevalent pesticide. But its action is very different from many other pesticides and weedicides. When sprayed on a plant, Glyphosate sticks on the leaves. It is then conducted from leaves, through the branches, down the stem, to the roots and to the soil. But it does not stop there. Glyphosate contaminates soil and also contaminates the water supply and aquatic organisms.

Facts and Fallacies
There are several enzyme system pathways in plants for the synthesis of amino acids similar to our body. This pathway is called the shikimate pathway. Glyphosate blocks one of these key enzymes in the shikimate pathway which is how it blocks the protein synthesis in plants. Here I will point to another falsehood presented by Monsanto. They said the shikimate pathway was present only in plants and therefore it did not affect human beings or animals. Its a clever argument but once again is not true. Because that shikimate pathway is present in bacteria and it affects all the good, beneficial bacteria in the gut, the professor explained.
Prof. Gunatilake says there are two reasons why Glyphosate is the worlds most popular weed-killer, the first being genetically modified crops also known as GMOs. Genetic modifications were actually a great discovery designed to address world hunger. In fact, Robert Fraley, the Monsanto scientist, even won the World Food Prize in 2013. His work was expected to lead to higher yielding crops that could resist insects, disease and extremes of climate. Their major discoveries were expected to eliminate world hunger. But did Monsanto try to eliminate world hunger questioned Prof. Gunatilake.
Instead of creating such crops, they started creating GMO food or crops that would resist Glyphosate. Sugar beets, for instance, are made resistant to Glyphosate through genetic modification. Alfalfa that is used to feed cows are all genetically modified and these foods have only grown over the last decades, starting from 1996 until recent years, Prof. Gunatilake said attributing the brands success to false advertising campaigns and genetically modified foods
In Sri Lanka, Prof. Gunatilake believes such false advertising has created what he calls a Glyphosate Culture where people are completely ignorant of the toxic effects of chemicals. Villagers today, just before uprooting a manioc plant, spray Glyphosate around it, so that the soil loosens making uprooting easy. Farmers divulge that they spray Glyphosate on gunny bags of rice, through and through, to store paddy for years.

Glyphosate by the numbers
Statistics reveal that the indiscriminate use of Glyphosate has risen 15 fold since 1992 in the US alone. Alarming levels of Glyphosate contamination of food have been reported in the US, where tap water, cows milk and plants were not spared. Interestingly, a study citing test results that found trace amounts of Glyphosate in Ben and Jerrys ice cream caused a stir in 2017. The trace levels reported at a rate of parts per billion (ppb) ranged from 0-1.74 ppb. However, Unilever owned Ben and Jerrys in a statement instead pointed to similar studies which found organic whole wheat bread testing 78 times higher and a popular whole grain oat breakfast cereal which had 646 times higher levels of Glyphosate. In their statement, Ben and Jerrys said they were concerned, but not totally surprised. Its everywhere  from mainstream food to natural and organic food, to rainwater, the statement said.
Prof. Gunatilake puts these numbers and figures in perspective. He says harm to human health could begin at the ultra-low levels of 0.1 parts per billion of Glyphosate. 0.1 parts per billion alters the gene function, they have found over four thousand altered genes in livers and kidneys of rats. One part per billion causes severe organ damage in rats. Ten parts per billion, researchers have found severely toxic to the livers of rats. Bear in mind that the permitted level of Glyphosate in tap water in the US is 700 parts per billion. In the US, Glyphosate was even found in breast milk about 16 hundred times higher than what is allowed in European drinking water standards, he revealed.
Meanwhile, a study by the US, published in the Journal of American Medical Association, looked at the Glyphosate excretion in urine of individuals. As Glyphosate was used in a massive scale from 1996 until 2016, there was a 13 fold increase in the excretion of Glyphosate in urine samples. This is sufficient evidence to declare that Monsanto is wrong regarding the bio-accumulation of Glyphosate. The more you use Glyphosate, the more it contaminates our food system and the more it will bio-accumulate in our bodies, he asserted.


Effects of Glyphosate at different levels:
0.5 parts per billion it disrupts human endocrine systems
	2 parts per billion it becomes anti oestrogenic
	5 parts per billion it causes DNA damage
	10 parts per billion - completely cytotoxic

Consequences of indiscriminate use
Prof. Gunatilake describes the deadly chemical as an octopus with poisonous tentacles reaching far and wide. Glyphosate exhibits its toxicity, in multiple ways. It interferes with the function of Cytochrome P450 (Cytochrome P450 enzymes are the most important enzymes in Phase-I metabolism in mammals.) There are so many ways it creates toxicity in the body that many experiments have been conducted to show how Glyphosate down-regulates systems. It chelates important minerals such as iron, cobalt and magnesium. As these peer-reviewed studies have shown, you dont need 30 parts per billion of Glyphosate to cause harm to human health.
The professor was referring to the worlds first research paper to show a causative link between consumption of Glyphosate at a real world environmental dose. Female rats were fed with an extremely-low dose of Roundup weed-killer (Glyphosate) in their drinking water over a two-year period and were found to suffer from non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). The dose selected by the researchers at Kings College in the UK was below what people are commonly exposed to in the everyday environment and thousands of times below what is permitted by regulators. The research was led by Dr. Michael Antoniou.
Prof. Gunathilake further elaborated on several diseases which have been linked with exposure to and consumption of Glyphosate. These diseases include diabetes, dementia, kidney disease and even autism. Im not saying that association causes causation. But the strength of these associations makes you very suspicious. The fact that there is biological plausibility makes you suspicious, he warned the medical professionals present.
Distressingly, Prof. Gunatilake also revealed that general exposure to pesticides during the third trimester of a womans pregnancy appears to be the riskiest. In one study, the odds of having a child with autism were higher; the closer a family has been living to pesticide application. There have been co-relations made between the critical shortages of neurotransmitters in the brain (Neurotransmitters control communication throughout your body and brain).
When Glyphosate gets incorporated into enzymes, it could cause a cascade of metabolic and haemostatic changes that result in kidney injury while amplifying harm from repeated episodes of acute kidney injury induced by harsh occupational conditions that includes conditions like dehydration which occur during working in the open paddy fields, he said.
People who were exposed to Glyphosate had DNA damage, according to comet testing, a technique used for the detection of DNA damage. What happens to a cell that is exposed to Glyphosate and has this kind of damage One of three things can happen to such a cell. If the damage is very severe the cell will die. If the cell is able to repair the DNA damage, it is restored to its normal function. If the DNA changes continue, it will end up as a cancer cell. Glyphosate now has been shown to down-regulate or get incorporated into these enzymes that do the repair of damaged DNA, causing the cells to become cancerous.

Glyphosate and Tea
I wont speak on the use of Glyphosate in tea plantations as an expert. But I would advise the tea industry with the limited information I have as an occupational medicine physician. As you spray Glyphosate in and around weeds in tea plantations, their resistance will rise. More spraying means more Glyphosate will be added to the environment that will get drained downed the river and will contaminate many of our water supplies. If you want to bring Glyphosate to the tea industry, I advise them to research the effects of commercial weed control. For instance, in a case study in Hapugastenna estate, results show that 20 out of 23 weed species have already developed resistance and cannot be controlled by herbicides such as Glyphosate, he cautioned. Monsantos patent expired in 200. They wanted to keep Glyphosate for themselves and they patented it as an antibiotic. With all the members of the SLMA and the Health Minister present here, I ask you; can the registrar of pesticides prescribe something that is registered as an antibiotic
In a concluding note, Prof. Gunatilake said the total evidence amassed by researchers worldwide cannot be ignored. What matters is that we look at the total evidence here. In occupational medicine, that principle is called the weight of evidence. What I have presented to you is the weight of evidence on how toxic Glyphosate is. Some 25,000 have already succumbed to kidney disease in Sri Lanka. How many years will it take for us to prove that Glyphosate is the exact cause of these illnesses he queried. When there is mounting evidence of damage to human health, you need to take preventive measures, which were the reason we urged for the ban of Glyphosate in 2015. That evidence has doubled and tripled over the last few years but what did we do as a nation We took away that ban. The precautionary principle for environmental decision making must be exercised.
During the lively Q and A session that followed, a member of the audience posed several criticisms to the professor adding that there was not enough evidence to establish a link between Glyphosate and its adverse effects to human health, especially in the case of CKD. Prof. Gunatilake in response said that one requires a holistic view to understand the issue.
We have to look at animal and human evidence, biological plausibility, scientific evidence and the art of policy-making. The argument that Glyphosate is necessary for paddy and tea cultivation is a myth. Some studies from China can show you where they reduced the use of fertiliser and increased food production by 15 per cent, he said.
Echoing Prof. Gunathilakes comments, Nutritionist Dr. Damayanthi Perera also present in the audience voiced her concern over the making of public health policies. In making public health policies, you dont have to wait for conclusive evidence. In the case of the mad cow disease in Europe, when a few people were diagnosed with Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), they didnt wait to prove cause and effect. There was a British beef and milk bank that followed. You cant prove absolute cause and effect. Authorities have to make policy decisions with available data, Dr. Perera opined.

He has decided to enter the race again
	

Number One in yahapalanaya, who is also the Blue party leader is said to have taken a firm decision to enter the fray at the upcoming big poll.

However, it is not clear so far whether he has an idea of coming forward as a Green party-backed candidate. Nevertheless, his intimates say that it is a cinch that he will woo the support of the Blue party splinter groups and that of the minority communities in the country.
Meanwhile, some sources say that there is a strong possibility that Number One will try to make a political bargain with the Green party at the eleventh hour.
His regular visits to the North, South and the East these days are a prelude to his campaign in earnest, they say.
His intimates claim that holding the Blue partys May Day in the East this year for the first time was part of his poll campaign plan.

Srimadi Nandarani Devi being honoured at the awards ceremony in India.

Srimadi Nandarani Devi of International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON) Sri Lanka was recently awarded at the 43rd Annual Aryabhata International Awards 2017 which was held in Bangalore, India recently . 
Speaking to The Daily Mirror Nandarani Devi, better known as Mathaji among Lord Krishna devotees in Colombo, said that she was picked for the award after the organisers of the awards ceremony took into consideration what she has done as social service. 
According to Mathaji, she heads Bhakthivedantha Childrens Home which operates under the name Gokulan. The school is situated in Mabola, Wattala, where as many as 115 children receive education. These children receive an education up to the Ordinary Level Examination. When they finish this stage of their lives its time for them to bid adieu to the school. 
I never expected to win awards nor did I apply for it. People who visit Sri Lanka have informed the organisers of this award ceremony, about us and our work. This is probably how I was picked for the award, she said. 

She recalled how a documentary was done in Sri Lanka after the 2004 Tsunami in which some of the work done by the officials at the orphanage came under the spotlight. This documentary was shown in America

She recalled how a documentary was done in Sri Lanka after the 2004 Tsunami in which some of the work done by the officials at the orphanage came under the spotlight. This documentary was shown in America and the result was some philanthropist coming forward to donate a bus, a van and funds to make additions to the building at Gokulan. 
Mathaji said that the children at the orphanage engage in meditation, yoga, music and dancing apart from attending to school work. There are students who wish to work in the temple, which is part of Gokulan. We dont force them to be too spiritual because we are dealing with children. They pray to Lord Krishna, but lead a normal life, said Mathaji. 
Students at Gokulan grow up in a spiritual atmosphere which resonates love and peace; two things which devotees of Lord Krishna are assured of if they practice Krishna Consciousness. 
Students at Gokulan practise four strict religious vows which make then refrain from eating meat, having illicit sex, gambling and harming or killing living beings. 
The students at the school are happy that their mother (Mathaji) won an international award. An Award like this more than motivating anyone highlights the fact that this school is maintaining some regulations and serving the community. This award justifies the financial contributions individuals have made to maintain this institute, said Mathaji.

Joe Jackson, father of Michael Jackson, dies at 89
	
Joe Jackson, the father of music legends Michael and Janet Jackson, has died at age 89, a person close to the family has confirmed to the BBC.
Jackson passed away early on Wednesday morning after he had been in hospital for terminal pancreatic cancer, celebrity news website TMZ reports.
His death comes just two days after the anniversary of his son Michael Jackson's death nine years ago.
The Jackson family patriarch played a large role in the careers of The Jackson 5 as well as Michael and Janet Jackson.
Five sons - Jackie, Tito, Jermaine, Marlon and Michael - became the Jackson 5, joined at times by younger brother Randy, who also pursued a solo career.
Three daughters - LaToya, Rebbie, and, most famously, Janet - all fashioned their own pop careers under Jackson's management, with varying levels of recognition.
Jackson was the architect of his children's early successes, but some of them would later say he drove them with a zeal that bordered on abuse, with Michael and others alleging bullying, physical abuse and punishing work schedules.
Jackson later admitted that he had whipped Michael, but denied it could be categorised as a beating. "I whipped him with a switch and a belt. I never beat him. You beat someone with a stick," he told the BBC's Louis Theroux in 2003.
The interview made headlines after Jackson said in response to a question about Michael, "We don't believe in gays. I can't stand them."
The Jackson family was famously riven over the years by internal strife, which often played out in the full glare of the public eye, with various estrangements and arguments over money making their way through the courts.
Speaking to the Daily Mail before his father died on Wednesday, Jermaine Jackson said some members of the family were unable to gain access to Jackson in his final days.
"No one knew what was going on - we shouldn't have to beg, plead, and argue to see our own father, especially at a time like this," he said.
"We have been hurting. We were not being told where he was and couldn't get the full picture."
Jackson was born in 1928 in Fountain Hill, Arkansas and was the eldest of five children.
He described his own father, a university professor, as a domineering and strict presence.
Jackson nurtured ambitions of being a boxer and later played guitar with a blues band, The Falcons, but failed to win a recording deal.
In 1949 he married Katherine Scruse, a former classmate from Washington High School in East Chicago, Indiana, who raised their children while Jackson worked at a local steel mill.
In 1957, they lost a child, Brandon, to stillbirth. He would have been Marlon's twin brother.
During the 1960s, Jackson took control of his sons' burgeoning musical efforts and the Jackson 5 was born, later signing to Motown records in 1967.
The Jackson 5 splintered as Michael's solo career took off and he distanced himself from his father's management.
Jackson focused instead on his daughter Janet, who went on to become a massive star.
Jackson reportedly carried on a decades long extra-marital affair with Cheryl Terrell, a secretary 20 years his junior. The pair had a daughter, his 11th child, Joh'Vonnie, who is now 43, but Jackson remained married to Katherine all along.
He is survived by Katherine, who is 88, and nine of his 11 children.

Killing of Leopard: A non-bailable offence- Jagath
	
Lawyer and environmental protection activist Jagath Gunawardena said the killing of the leopard by villagers at Ambalakulam in Kilinochchi was a non-bailable offence under the Fauna and Flora Protection Ordinance.
He told Daily Mirror under Section 30 (2) of the Fauna and Flora Protection Ordinance the killing or harming such an animal would be a punishable offence and liable for imprisonment and fine on the discretion of the Court.
As provided by Section 67B of the Fauna and Flora Protection Ordinance, this kind of incident can be considered an offence where an arrest can be made without a warrant, he said. Such an incident has happened in Sri Lanka for the first time. However, these kinds of incidents are common in some foreign countries. It is a non-bailable offence."
Meanwhile, the four suspects arrested on charges of killing the leopard were remanded by the Kilinochchi Magistrates Court recently. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)

The Cobra has been an object of vivid imagination from very ancient times. It figures in various contexts in Hindu and Egyptian mythology. In fact, there is a reference to a King Cobra named Muchalinda in Buddhist literature as well.

It may greatly surprise you to hear that the mystical King Cobra that fired the imagination of our ancients and occupied a place of pride in mythology has entered the life of one of our prominent politicos live and real in a big way!
A legal expert who once held very high office in the countrys judiciary, this politico is currently heading a provincial administration.
While addressing a public rally in his province, the politico had revealed about a King Cobra that serves him as his guiding spirit. 
This King Cobra was my pathfinder when I was serving in the judiciary and it continues to show me the way even after coming into politics, he told a wide-eyed audience. The politico had also said that King Cobra had come to his rescue whenever he had to face a crisis in life.
The politicos friendly King Cobra has become the main topic that people in the province are said to be discussing excitedly these days. And some of them even wonder whether it was his King Cobra which advised him to change his political direction as well.

LEOPARD of Kilinochchi and Buddhist Compassion Message of Arhant Mahinda Thera on fauna and flora
	
Minister Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka and his controversial Deputy Minister Palitha Thevarapperuma vehemently condemned the brutal act too and vowed to take action against the perpetrators
	
	Animal welfare activists use their sophisticated expressions like endangered imperilled, threatened speciesin describing the Diviya variety

It was 23 centuries ago,on Poson Poya Day in the 236th Buddhist era, that Arhant Mahinda Thera arrived at the Ambastala rock, Mihintale from Jambuddveepa carrying with him a noble message. His first act was to intervene and stop the monarch killing a deer; not because of it belonged to an endangered species, but in his own wordsthe birds of the air and the beasts on the earth have an equal right to live and move about in any part of this land as thou.

The villagers act has been condemned not only by animal lover organisations backed by NGOs, but every sensible and compassionate individual, especially on the killers follow up with disgusting and barbarous celebrations

Devanampiya Tissa, was out on hunting in the hill range with a few of his upper class men and soldiers. He was about to release the arrow from his bow to kill a deer when Mahinda Thera called out Tissa, Tissa. The Royal party was frightened on seeing for the first time men in yellow robes and with shaven heads thinking them to be some evil spirits. Arhant Mahinda impressed them - the King dropped his bow and worshipped. It was merely an act committed through compassion for both the animal and the King which led to the King and a large section of his subjects giving up slaughter of animal for consumption.
The writer is rather baffled why the people make such a huge hue and cry, especially, the Buddhists over an act of a single beast being destroyed as a protective measure or in self defence, a right preserved in the Law of the Land, [of course, it could have been avoided] especially, in this thrice blessed island where they brutally slaughter around 1000 cattle heads, millions of birds and gather a few tons of fish every day, which continues unabated.


A Sri Lankan leopard named Panthera Pardus Kotiyaa subspecies native to the island had reportedly attacked nearly 10 people, before the villagers of Ambalkulam in Kilinochchi had captured and killed it. The villagers act has been condemned not only by animal lover organisations backed by NGOs, but every sensible and compassionate individual, especially on the killers follow up with disgusting and barbarous celebrations. Authorities recommend action taken against the people who cruelly tortured and killed the leopard. The police who had little time in catching contract murderers and robbers who have been increasingly threatening the society are already on the job seeking nearly a dozen villagers who beat their Siruththai enemy to death after it strayed into a village and attacked their people.
The leopard had leapt out of a shrub and tried to attack several persons during the search, prompting the men to assault and slay the animal with rods and sticks. A video of villagers attacking the animal went viral on social media which raised a question mark on the responsibility of the Wildlife officers whom according to information were sluggish and took time on acting on the complaints. Ten people injured by the leopard had been admitted to a local hospital. A wildlife officer suffered injuries too and was rushed to the hospital.
Animal welfare activists use their sophisticated expressions like endangered imperilled, threatened speciesin describing the Diviya variety. The most endangered however, are the Amur Leopard, a rare leopard found only in Russias Primorye district. According to records only 21 animals are in existence. A list of animals called Red list carries our Leopard in their 1964-founded International Union for Conservation of Nature [IUCN] Red list of global conservation status of biological species, the proponents of which seem to be totally ignorant of the numerous theories on evolution of animal kingdom as put forward by Charles Darwin and his associates and contemporaries. Populations and species of organisms change over time. British naturalist Charles Darwin proposed the theory of biological evolution by natural selection. Evolution is the thought that species modify over time, give rise to novel species, and share a common forerunner. The mechanism is natural selection. Resources are restricted in nature, organisms with inherited character that favour endurance and reproduction will be inclined to leave more progeny than their peers, reasoning the characters to enhance in frequency over generations. As long as there is genetic variation and dissimilarities in surroundings there has to be evolution.Can we conclude, for Panthera Pardus Kotiya to survive; it has to overcome the theory of natural selection
However, many scientific theories are explained indistinctly; for instance, species in environmental science cannot be defined precisely owing to many unclear areas. Nonetheless, the notions and ideas can be reasonably and practically applicable. Darwin assumed that one species had divided off and evolved into a fresh one, but the dynamic progression or the uninterrupted flux makes it unworkable to demarcate where one species ended and a fresh one appeared.


Role of Minister of Buddha Sasana
Sustainable Development and Wildlife Minister Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka and his controversial Deputy Minister Palitha Thevarapperuma vehemently condemned the brutal act too and vowed to take action against the perpetrators. They have right to do so.

It clearly defines Buddhist attitude in relation to harming other conscious beings. Buddhists are trained to restrain from butchery in three habits- direct killing, indirect killing and refraining from acting in such a manner that others would harm or kill

As reported, Former Wildlife Minister and present Minister of Buddha Sasana, Gamini Jayawickrama Perera has said it was a shameful act committed by the youths adding that it was a disgrace to humankind. He further emphasised that stern action should be taken against the culprits. But when it comes to ruthless killing of millions for human consumption, the Minister and the constitutional guarantee to protect Buddhism is ineffective and toothless.

Arhant Mahinda Thera and Fauna and Flora
The first sermon by the Thera includes the words Fauna and flora- O great King! the birds of the air and the beasts on the earth have an equal right to live and move about in any part of this land as thou. The land belongs to the people and all other beings and thou art only the guardian of it. This undoubtedly is one of the oldest, if not the oldest recorded communication on nature protection. Prior to this day, like in non-Buddhists nations, hunting was enjoyed by the elite of society, a practice that changed under the Buddhist thinking of respect for all forms of life  killing was prohibited. The symbiotic relationship between human actions; the pleasant co-existence of all conscious including ecosystems and humankind are instituted in the foundation of Buddhist dogma. Buddhist teachings are essentially connected to the issues of animal welfare; thereby it provides a Buddhist insight into the origins of animal cruelty. It deals with rigid procedures to reduce its harmful consequences.
King Devanampiya Tissa reverently accepted the wisdom of the Buddha and acknowledged it. Cultured civilization commenced to appear with the launch of the Bhikku Sasanaya, plus other basics of religious rituals, song and dance forms, art and architecture; literature prospered. King Tissa whose leisure was hunting, became a vegan followed by a significant section of the islands population: agriculture surpassed slaughter in early Dhammadveepa. The Dhamma trains us to be watchful and conscious of the misery of the others. It clearly defines Buddhist attitude in relation to harming other conscious beings. Buddhists are trained to restrain from butchery in three habits- direct killing, indirect killing and refraining from acting in such a manner that others would harm or kill.
Flesh eating cause harm to many creatures; which is, always avoidable. Becoming a vegetarian does not engage huge sacrifices. One needs only a little self-control and concern. Today, there are a variety of cheap, appetizing, nutritious vege foods that are easily obtainable. The option of becoming vegan is, of all moral choices we can make, is one of the most advantageous. By opting for a fleshless-diet would not only assist us to engage a healthy existence by accepting enhanced nutritious eating practice; but will also guide to an added eco-sensitive actions being adopted by communities which eventually add to the general well being of animals and to the decrease of the overall effects on typeof climate. According to the UN, the meat industry is one of the most noteworthy provider to the environmental disasters encountered. 

Vegetarianism & animal welfare
Rising consumption patterns of meat and other animal products has led to the expansion of animal husbandry based industries that adopt commercial methods of manufacture. These comprise more labour concentrated, industrial farming practices, in which they subject animals to inconceivable cruelty, pain and harm. Animals are raised for food with injected hormones that speed up the breeding course. Housing and transportation methods used are appalling. The cruelty encountered in butchery in meat production are deplorable; and much worse than the treatment meted out to the Leopard by the Kilinochchi gang. 

The cruelty in meat production; much worse than the treatment meted out to the Leopard by the Kilinochchi gang

Whichever way we look at it, let it be moral or economic, man has a vital requirement to look after this biodiversity. Governments, civil society, businesses, and individuals, need to work jointly if we are to save our rich natural resources. No human organisation can make the Panthera Pardus Kotiya survive forever, for the human species itself is subject to imperilled and disappear from the planet, giving way to a new Homo ..

May all beings be happy!

NEVER-ENDING DILEMMAS!!!
	

Today, we live in a world on the brink of annihilation. A world gone mad with power-hungry people, disasters both natural and augmented, ferries sinking, volcanic hazards, floods, earthquakes, drugs, flights catching fire or airplanes going down, and additionally a record of 68.5 million people displaced worldwide. In a society governed passively by free markets and free elections, organised greed always defeats disorganised democracy! 

We finally hear that a Corruption High Court opens on July 15!!! Apparently, this has accounted for long delays in the resolution of court cases; the main obstacle towards ensuring good governance. Money laundering, bribery, huge financial crimes, misappropriation of property, criminal breach of trust by public servants, with the FCID receiving 335 cases, of which only 99 have been investigated and held over for due process!!! The Avant Garde revised application due to come up only on July 2!!! Promise of the Bond report!!! AGAIN WE ASK, WHY SUCH A HUGE TIME LAPSE The nigger in the woodpile, Ravi K is apparently complaining that he cannot get into Parliament without interference!!! So he asks, IS THIS DEMOCRACY WE WERE GIVEN POWER TO RESTORE THE COUNTRY, NOT TO BE SHUT OUT BY PEOPLE HOLDING BOARDS!!! SO, WE ASK, DID THIS GOVERNMENT RESTORE DEMOCRACY MORE LIKELY HYPOCRISY WITH THE LIKES OF HIM!!!

It has taken a foreign envoy, the German Ambassador to say the government should implement the agenda on which it was elected to office in 2015!!! No one could have made a more explicit statement!!! Doesnt the government still realise that the true measure of all our actions is how long the good in them lasts The sad truth is they have not done ANY GOOD SO THEIR MISDEMEANOURS AND UNTRUTHS ARE WHAT WILL OUTLAST THEM!!!

The ongoing verbal battle is about the Prison Jumper the Buddhist monk is expected to wear!!! Before this too there were religious leaders (14 of them behind bars) who wore prison jumpers, but no one spoke of them! Why has only the BBS been singled out What about the yellow-robed ones who wear trousers at night to creep into night clubs, where prostitutes are made available to them Is that better than wearing the prison jumper Why is no one talking about those happenings Is that behaviour accepted under the precepts of Buddhism THERE IS SO MUCH THAT BUDDHISM DOES NOT ALLOW BUT WHICH IS HAPPENING NONETHELESS!!!

The next election is targeted for 2020!!! We wonder if by then the poor will find a way to live as they can hardly make ends meet now!!! We hear that in India, politicians are being chased with slippers!!! The way things are progressing in our country, it is likely that we should also get ready for that!!! Targeted elections mean nothing to them; you see our President going to sleep at 10 oclock!!! He is such a lucky guy as there is nothing to keep him awake; absolutely nothing to worry about. After all, everything in the country is fine!!! Our President says he gleans knowledge of what is happening in the country by reading newspapers!!! Therefore, from 10 oclock at night until he wakes up in the morning, nothing is happening OR even if things do happen, they are of no significance Even if the gravity of anything dawns on this nitwit, he most probably goes AIYO! DID THIS REALLY HAPPEN HOW COME I DID NOT KNOW ABOUT IT LITTLE DOES HE REALISE THAT THE VOTER MIGHT PUT HIM TO SLEEP ALTOGETHER ONE OF THESE DAYS, UNLESS HE STOPS SLEEPING AND STARTS LISTENING TO WHAT THE PEOPLE SAY!!! The poor man in this country CANNOT SLEEP!!! He has so many burdens, so much to worry about, so many problems to which he cannot find solutions, so NO SLEEP, NO PEACE OF MIND TO SLEEP!!!

THE POOR MANS MAJOR PROBLEM IS SCHOOLING HIS CHILDREN. HE CANNOT! HE JUST CANNOT FIND THE MONEY TO GET HIS CHILD EVEN INTO GRADE 1!!! This column has repeatedly talked about this deadlock situation where parents are helpless but NOTHING HAPPENS!!! We should send our erstwhile educated one to Finland Montessori to get himself a good education, perhaps he will then understand the value of a good education and the burden poor parents in this country have to cope with!!! Now they are talking about a medical insurance of Rs.200,000 per child  ONLY TALKING, NOTHING DONE!!! Pragmatically speaking, how can people, especially ministers who have no children, understand the gravity of not being able to admit their children to school

Children face huge problems because of their parents  they feel unloved, unwanted!!! I read that one child whose mother was a teacher was correcting test papers and she was crying while doing so. When her husband questioned her, she said it was their sons paper and in it he sorrowfully explains how neither of his parents has time for him, to even talk or to play with him, because their lives are governed by smart phones!!!

Our President says he gleans knowledge of what is happening in the country by reading newspapers!!! Therefore, from 10 oclock at night until he wakes up in the morning, nothing is happening OR even if things do happen, they are of no significance

Because this little boy had the courage to speak out, he was able to regain the love of his parents!!! Sadly, how many children go through this terrible trauma today not being able to talk to their parents THE ADVANCEMENT OF TECHNOLOGY HAS BEEN TO THE DETRIMENT OF MANKIND, ESPECIALLY OUR CHILDREN!!!

There is yet another aspect of humanity I would like to dwell on. Apparently, a trial was held in New York, on a cold January night; an old tattered looking lady was being tried for stealing a loaf of bread. She looked ashamed when the mayor asked if she stole the loaf of bread!!! She lowered her head and said, Thats right Your Honour, I did steal the loaf of bread. He then questioned her motive; asked if she was hungry. She said she was famished but that it was not for her that she stole the bread but for the two children of her sick daughter, who had not eaten for days! The judge then told her everyone was equal before the law and she could choose to either pay a fine of $10 or go to jail. She opted to go to jail as she did not have a single penny!!! The judge then took money out of his pocket and paid her fine!!! Additionally, he ordered the bailiff to collect -/50cts from everyone in court and give it to the poor lady. He said no old lady should have to steal a loaf of bread! COULD SUCH A HUMANE ACT HAVE HAPPENED IN OUR COUNTRY Cataract is the third biggest cause of blindness; religion and politics remain the first two.

## Title: No torture under any circumstances

No torture under any circumstances
	
Yesterday was the United Nations Day in support of victims of torture with the world body saying that torture seeks to annihilate the victims personality and denies the inherent dignity of the human being. According to the UN, despite the strict prohibition of torture under international law, torture persists in all regions of the world.
Concerns about protecting national security and borders are increasingly used to allow torture and other forms of cruel, degrading and inhuman treatment. 
Though the UN makes no mention of it for obvious reasons we see this happening today in the United States, which was considered the citadel of the free world and democratic governance. US President Donald Trump and Attorney General Jeff Sessions have declared a zero tolerance policy towards immigrants who cross the Southern border without proper documents. Implementing this policy in a manner which most analysts described as cruel or brutal, the Trump administration earlier this month separated the children from the families that crossed the border. Some 2,500 children including some babies of the tender age of three to six months, were kept in what some analysts described as cages while their parents were taken elsewhere, sometimes to faraway places and detained. 
The dangerously unpredictable President Trump who has often acted in a cruel or crude manner came under intense national and international pressure to stop this inhumane separation of children from their parents. International TV channels showed heart-breaking images of the children in detention with one visual having the voice cut of their children pleading for their parents. The crisis was given a cruel twist when a detention centre guard was heard to say they only need an orchestra to back the cry of the children. 
The undocumented emigrants had come from Nicaragua, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and other Latin American countries where savage gangs such as MS13 are threatening to torture or kill the families if the teenage children were not handed over for underworld gang operations. Later last week Mr. Trump revoked his decision but even yesterday both administration officials and volunteer organisations said they were unable to identify who was whose child because no documents had been obtained when they were separated. 
According to the UN, torture and its pervasive consequences often go beyond the isolated act on an individual. It can be transmitted through generations and lead to cycles of violence. The UN has condemned torture from the outset as one of the vilest acts perpetrated by human beings on their fellow human beings.
Torture is a crime under international law. According to all relevant instruments, it is absolutely prohibited and cannot be justified under any circumstances. This prohibition forms part of customary international law. This means it is binding on every member of the international community, regardless of whether a State has ratified international treaties in which torture is expressly prohibited. The systematic or widespread practice of torture constitutes a crime against humanity, the UN says.
UN Secretary General Antnio Guterres in a message says, torture remains unacceptable and unjustified at all times, including during states of emergency, political instability, or even in a war. On this day, let us also pay tribute to all those who stand in solidarity with victims and their families and reaffirm our commitment to ending this abominable and useless practice, he adds. 
In Sri Lanka after the new government took over and revived media freedom, transparency and accountability, instances of torture have come down. But in the aftermath of the 30-year war and two youth uprisings in the South, torture appears to be still persisting in the system of some sections of the security forces. We hope that security forces, the government and all the people will come to the realisation that torture is inhuman and cannot be justified under any circumstances.

Northern CM opposes using soldiers for development projects
	
The government's decision to deploy army personnel to reconstruct abandoned tanks in Vavuniya was opposed by the Northern Province Chief Minister C.V. Wigneswaran and other Tamil MPs when this matter was discussed at Tuesday's Vavuniya District Development Committee meeting.
The meeting was presided by Industries and Commerce Minister Rishad Bathiudeen with the participation of Deputy Minister Kader Masthan, Mr. Wigneswaran, TNA MPs, provincial councillors, Vavuniya GA Somaratne Widanapathirana and security officials.
The minister said the government had approved Cabinet memo seeking the assistance of the army in the reconstruction of abandoned tanks in Vavuniya.
MP Sivashakthi Anandan said the army should not be used for this purpose as their duties were not relevant to this type of work and instead the assistance of the Rural Development Committees should be sought. This opinion was supported by the CM who said the army should not get involved in development activities.
But however the Sinhala Pradeshiya Sabah members objecting said using Rural Development Committee members could cause delays and commissions and bribes were bound to take place. They said by deploying the army the value for the money spent would increase and the work would be completed in double quick time. (Romesh Madushanka)

Patient dies inside ambulance after driver makes 'pitstop'
	
An ambulance driver who was entrusted with the task of taking a patient from the Galgamuwa Atharagalla divisional hospital to the Kurunegala General Hospital for further treatment had diverted from the route to transport a grass cutting machine to his residence, a delay that cost a farmer his life.
The health officer in charge of the Atharagalla divisional hospital Dr. A. M. N.S. Bandara has requested an inquiry into the incident from the Provincial Director of Health Services and the District Health Director.
Sources revealed that 54-year-old farmer G.R. Gunathileke, a father of two, had suddenly fallen ill and was taken to the Atharagalla hospital. After the doctors examined him they had found his condition to be serious and ordered that the patient be transferred to the Kurunegala General Hospital by ambulance.
The patients wife, I.M. Dammika Kumari (44), said that while her husband was being taken to the Kurunegala General Hospital in the ambulance the driver had taken a different route in order to hand over a grass cutting machine to his house and by the time the ambulance finally reached the hospital they had found that her husband had died inside the ambulance. She said the drivers delay in getting her husband over to the hospital for the death of her husband.
Dr Bandara said that he received a call at about 8.30 pm telling him that the patient who left the hospital in an ambulance at about 5.10 pm had died. He had inquired from the attendant the cause for this delay, to which he replied that the ambulance had gone through Madagalla and Ibbagamuwa. When questioned as to why the driver had gone out of the way the attendant had replied that as there was a grass cutting machine to be handed over to the drivers home they had deviated from the route.
The driver, when questioned, stated that this was the closest route to the hospital. The patient had died while passing through Ibbagamuwa at around 7.10 pm. The driver had then hurriedly driven the ambulance with the siren on.
Investigations are continuing.(Nihal Jayaweera)

Petroleum bowsers to strike 48 hrs from Sunday night
	
The Ceylon Petroleum Private Bowser Owners Association (CPPBOA) said today that its members would launch a 48-hour work stoppage from midnight Sunday (July 1) demanding that hiring charges be increased.
CPPBOA Secretary Shantha Silva said they had requested for an increase in the hiring charges in the wake of the recent fuel price increase and that they would continue the work stoppage if the authorities fail to grant their demand.
The CPC authorities and the subject minister will have to take the responsibility for the inconvenience caused to motorists because of the resultant fuel shortage countrywide," Mr. Silva said. When we met Petroleum Resources Development Minister Arjuna Ranatunga, he assured us he would provide a solution by June 8, Mr. Silva said.
He said we had initially planned to launch the token strike on Friday but had postponed it because of Poson and did not want to inconvenience pilgrims.Hiring charges for a 13,200-gallon bowser should be increased by 12.5 per cent and rates for a 19,800-gallon bowser and 33,000-gallon bowser should be increased by nine per cent, Mr. Silva said and added that their request was for an average increase of 12.5 per cent."
He said private bowsers transport some 80 per cent of the total fuel requirements and that CPPBOA members own more than 800 bowsers while the CPC owns 65 bowsers and should we continue the work stoppage, the entire country would face a severe fuel shortage.
Mr. Silva said the CPC would be unable to meet the country's fuel requirements with the bowsers it owns and we regret the inconvenience caused to motorists. (Chaturanga Samarawickrama)

Pot calling the kettle black
	

The Green partys Diyawanna group met last week with the party leader, Number Two in yahapalanaya in the chair.

The parlous state of the countrys economy had been the main topic that had come under discussion at this meeting. The politico who once handled the countrys purse strings at the top table taking the floor after several members had expressed their views on the economic problems facing the country had launched a tirade on the incumbent for mismanaging the countrys economy. He had claimed that he could do much for the good of the people and the uplift the economy if he was handling the portfolio. Our economy is heading to a morass I cant help feeling sorry for our people and the country, he had added.
The Green leader in the chair had been quietly listening while the former handler of the countrys purse strings was holding forth, breathing fire at his successor who, by the way was not present at the meeting. There had been pin-drop silence at the meeting as the ousted one was lashing out at his successor. Silence had greeted even the conclusion of his tirade which some had later likened to an aftermath of a heavy downpour, they say.

SL top global safety destination for women travellers
	
The Peoples Daily newspaper of China selected Sri Lanka as the top global safety destination for women travellers in 2018, in a recently concluded contest, which combined the results of expert reviews, ratings and popular votes. Sri Lanka topped the list of 20 countries that were selected, including USA, Canada, New Zealand, Australia, Japan, Switzerland and the Maldives, a statement from Sri Lanka Embassy in Beijing said.
It said;
The awards were presented to representatives from the Embassies and travel bureaus of the winning countries on 05 June 2018, at a ceremony held during the 2018 Womens Safe Travel Experience Summit, co-organized by the Peoples Daily and the Capital Normal University.
Ambassador for Sri Lanka to China Dr Karunasena Kodituwakku, speaking as the representative of the winning country, thanked the Peoples Daily for recognizing Sri Lankas commitment to the safety of tourists visiting the country, particularly women travellers who are rapidly becoming a strong demographic in the tourism sector.
Stressing on the importance of safety as a deciding factor in selecting a travel destination, Dr Kodituwakku said that Sri Lankan people are hospitable, friendly and ever ready to provide a helping hand to travellers who need assistance. He also noted that tourist places are well organized, with dedicated staff to guide and help tourists enjoy their visits, and highlighted the presence of a tourist police division dedicated to addressing and processing complaints in a speedy manner and who regularly liaise with the travel industry to improve safety measures for tourists.

Thus Speaks the Judiciary
	
Two very recent court decisions deserve attention. One is the prison sentence imposed on Galabodaaththe Gnanasara Thera for criminally threatening a litigant who had sought recourse through courts to find her missing husband, a veteran journalist. The second involves the granting of Rs.400,000 by the Supreme Court, as the cost of appeal to the wife of a smoker who died of lung cancer. The first shows that, after all, the rule of law applies to all without distinction while the second is vital in terms of the scope of litigation that it opens up for future litigants as well as the judicial recognition that legal procedures are being used or misused by the able to delay and deny justice. 
The judgement of the Homagama Magistrate on the abusive and law-breaking bikkhu, is commendable, in the least, in a country where it is felt that those in places of authority whether political, business or religious, are beyond the arm of the law. We have seen the awkwardness of the law courts in merely serving summons on robe-wearers; this is in addition to the seemingly untouchable status of personnel of the three security forces. 
The general public, though not experts in the law or legal concepts are intuitively aware about what is right and just. That is why in a jury trial, the jury consists of ordinary people with some kind of basic background, but without any specific legal credentials. That is one instance where conscience and commonsense is deemed better than in-depth knowledge of the law in seeing what is just and fair . 
Lord Denning, perhaps the most brilliant legal luminary of our times, said the need was not for judges with extraordinary knowledge of the law, but with an understanding of what justice and fairness are. What wisdom from that great mind. In fact it is judges of that particular quality that modern society needs in earnest; when it comes to countries like ours, the need is felt that much more acutely. 

Judiciary as the weakling
Some say that the Judiciary is the weakest branch of the state viz a viz the executive and the legislative. I disagree. The judiciary might lack the military might of the executive or the popular clout of the legislature, yet it has the respect and deference of the general public; the power to persuade, inspire, mobilize the masses not in the manner politicians do, but in a silent, gradual and steady way. We call it soft power. 
Soft power is gaining prominence even in affairs of State and international diplomacy. In the same vein, the soft power of the judiciary is second to none. Judgements by courts which the public embrace as reasonable, just and brave, go a long way in building up the image of the judiciary to a large extent. 
There is a common belief that the law courts are a place where any damn fib could be adorned as truth while even a biblical truth is undermined if one has the means to have the best counsel around. Instances of such notorious ingenuity of lawyers using technical grounds to win cases, most of the time letting loose murderers on hair splitting arguments are now folklore in showing how far from each other law and justice in fact are. 

Disillusioned with Law
The growing disillusionment with state institutions such as the Police, Law Courts, Public Offices does not augur well for democracy or a civilized society in general. When the common man realizes that what he reverently submits to as the supreme Law does not apply to the high and the mighty, he will take the law into his own hands. Thus, is born the lynch mob.

The hue and cry generated in the backdrop of the errant bhikku being clad in a prison jumper is not only frivolous but tainted with extreme bigotry

The Executive and the Legislative arms of the State have lost credibility and enjoy very little soft power in the eyes of the public. But that is exactly where the judiciary holds the upper hand; in being able to retain the confidence of the public and in turn, to convince them that abiding by law, is not merely to avoid penal repercussions, but more so to benefit them making life more safe, benign and wholesome as human beings. When a very senior judge saluted with reverence the wife of the Police Security Officer who died in the line of duty, we saw the awe inspired in the society for that act of humility and benevolence of a powerful state functionary. 
The hue and cry generated in the backdrop of the errant bhikku being clad in a prison jumper is not only frivolous but tainted with extreme bigotry. To start with he is not the first monk (or member of the clergy ) in a prison jumper because fifteen of them, it is said, had faced the same predicament and we had not heard any grumbling at all. Secondly, where were the monks up the hierarchy, pleading clemency for this delinquent in saffron robe when he ran amok like a rabid dog, biting all and sundry. Thalduwe Somarama and Buddharakkhitha as well as Matthew Pieris, did time in the Government Boarding wearing what other prisoners wore. That is justice. Even if one concedes that Law and Justice do not overlap each other perfectly, we need the law to be applied generally, universally and without distinction. 

The growing disillusionment with state institutions such as the Police, Law Courts, Public Offices does not augur well for democracy or a civilized society in general

The second case was the one where the Supreme Court made an order, on a Special Leave to Appeal made by Ceylon Tobacco Company in a case filed by a person who died of lung cancer after being a long time smoker. The Order was of a preliminary nature and not final, yet the Supreme Court recognized the fact that legal procedures such as right to appeal can be used by the economically stronger parties to frustrate the very just and legitimate claims of those who are not wealthy. An eye opener for many judicial officers who seem to think that the law in the abstract is all that matters. 

A chequered history
The Judiciary of this country has a chequered history; yet though bent, it is not broken entirely. It is often pressured but has not perished. It has in its ranks those individuals, who are ready and brave enough to uphold the law and more important, with justice and fairness, which is the strongest thread that can hold together a fast disintegrating societal structure. They speak out with their decisions that justice should be the hallmark of sound law and secondly that the law should apply equally to all irrespective of their civil status, economic prowess or any other extraneous criteria. 
At the same time we need those judicial decisions penalizing culprits to be enforced and not confined to paper decrees. Right of appeal as well as the presidential pardon under the Constitution should not be allowed to frustrate the long arm of the law reaching the high and mighty and the ordinary alike. 
After all, judicial power, too, is an extension of the sovereign power of the people according to Article 3 of the Constitution. If the people decide otherwise, then the Bench too will come crashing down.

True meaning of happiness in Buddhism
	


It is human nature to be engaged relentlessly in the search of happiness
	
	This confirms that living beings are fundamentally happiness oriented
	
	The central theme of Buddhism is Dukkha meaning suffering or unsatisfactoriness


Happiness in Pali is called sukha which is both used as a noun meaning happiness, ease, blissful or pleasure and as an adjective meaning blissful or pleasant. Happiness can be loosely defined as satisfying the will. If you achieve what you have been dreaming of or yearning for; then you are said to be happy. Pursuing this definition of happiness you may do countless things to fulfill your wishes, so that you will be happy. You may spend all your time, money, energy and skill to make your life and that of your family, friends and relatives happy. Generally, people misconstrue the source of happiness. They think that by pleasing their insatiable desires they can be happy. They do not realize that the means available to them to please their desires are limited by time and space. When you try to obtain happiness by pleasing unlimited and insatiable desire by means limited by time and space you end up in frustration and also losing whatever little relative happiness you have. 

It is human nature to be engaged relentlessly in the search of happiness. What you find by searching for it is not relaxation but stress. Further, in our search for happiness we end up with sorrow as well. Sorrow makes you helpless. You scold yourself. You soon realize that you have been running after something you can never get. We expect to stay happy all the time, throughout life. Basically, there are two kinds of happiness. One is where happiness and sorrow march hand in hand. The other is where there is neither sorrow nor happiness. One who does not know the Dhamma keeps searching for the former. One who knows the Dhamma will only search for the latter; that is happiness without both sorrow and happiness. 


Buddhist concept of happiness 
Buddhism asserts that every living being is inherently disposed to reject discomfort and to seek and enjoy gratification of the senses. This confirms that living beings are fundamentally happiness oriented. In Buddhism there are five strands of sense desires; and the happiness and well-being arising there from are called sensuous happiness. They are forms cognized by the eye, ear, nose, tongue and touch. If enjoying sensual pleasure is happiness then a human being with all the senses intact ought to be a happy man. On the contrary, the central theme of Buddhism is Dukkha meaning suffering or unsatisfactoriness. In fact the heart of the Buddhas teaching lies in the Four Noble Truths. They are Dukkha or suffering; Samudaya or origin of suffering; Nirodha or the cessation of suffering and Magga or the way leading to the cessation of suffering. If suffering is a fundamental tenet of Buddhism then it is reasonable to assume that the condition of happiness is something alien to Buddhism. On the contrary happiness is not a banned condition or a prohibited word in Buddhism. Happiness in Buddhism is not superficial. True happiness in Buddhism is a condition ingrained in the inner conscience of a good Buddhist. 

Buddhism sub-divides happiness under two categories; namely happiness that may be experienced or Vedayita and happiness that cannot be experienced or Avedayita. Forms of happiness that can be experienced are Empirical or Amisa, Physical or Kayika, Material or Bhautika, Worldly or Lokika and Household or Gihi. Forms of non-experiential happiness are; Non-Material or Niramisa, Mental or Manasika, Spiritual or Ajjhattika, Super Worldly or Lokuttara and Monastic or Pabbajita. However, the supreme happiness which happens to be non-experiential is the happiness of attaining Nibbana. Nibbana is a rare phenomenon and it cannot be attained that easily. The happiness that is said to be close to Nibbana is the serene happiness of monastic life. 

Ways and Means of Achieving Happiness 
Man is a mysterious being with inconceivable potentialities. Latent in him are both saintly characteristics and criminal tendencies. One powerful destructive vice in man is anger or Dosa. The sweet virtue that subdues this evil force and sublimes man is loving kindness or Metta. Cruelty is another vice responsible for many horrors and atrocities prevalent in the world. Compassion or Karuna is its antidote. Jealousy is another vice that poisons ones system and lends to unhealthy rivalries and dangerous competitions. The best remedy for this venomous state is sympathetic joy or Muditha. There are two other universal characteristics that upset the mental equipoise of man; namely attachment to the pleasurable and aversion to the non-pleasurable. These two opposite forces can be eliminated by developing equanimity or Upekkha. The practice of these four sublime states or virtues would elevate man to a high state of happiness. 

All of us without exception have within us the root of happiness. But it remains buried under a heap of rubbish called hatred, jealousy tension, worry and anxiety. In order to discover the root of happiness we have to remove the very root of unhappiness and cultivate and nourish the root of happiness. The Buddha prescribed a very practical way of cultivating happiness through the practice of loving kindness. 

In verse 16 of the Dhammapada the Buddha extolled the virtues of such good deeds as follows; He rejoices here, he rejoices in the hereafter, seeing the pure deed he has done. Buddhism asserts that the root cause of all suffering is craving. It is from the total elimination, complete eradication and the total absence of craving that happiness is ensured. It is by giving up and not by obtaining sense pleasure that one gains real happiness. 


The way forward to Nibbana
The purification of the mind is an essential prerequisite for achieving the goal of ultimate happiness. Verse 2 of the Dhammapada further explains this concept as follows; if one acts or speaks with a pure state of mind, then what happiness follows like a shadow that constantly trails behind. Happiness is generated by the mind which is free from factors that are opposed to happiness. The very source that generates happiness is the purified mind; not the impure mind. Verses 118 of the Dhammpada explain how repeatedly doing good deeds with a pure mind generates happiness as follows. Should a person perform a meritorious action, he should do it again and again; he should find pleasure therein; blissful is accumulation of merit. 

How does one purify the mind When following Buddhas way one will encounter three stages; namely moral behaviour or Sila, concentration or Samadhi and wisdom or Panna. Happiness cannot be found without advancing through all these stages. You will never find happiness in a greedy hateful or ignorant mind as these are the very roots of unhappiness, pain and suffering. The foundation of happiness lies in the practice of moral principles. This means that happiness comes from leading a life full of morals. Accordingly, if somebody realizing the impediments of sensual pleasure becomes a Bikkhu, a homeless one, entirely dependent on others for his livelihood and practices principles of wanting less, contentment, solitude, perseverance, mindfulness, concentration and cultivates wisdom to free the mind from all defilements, such a person really and truly enjoys a higher degree of happiness. This practice leads him to realize the Dhamma and the way forward to give up craving, desire, lust, attachment, possessiveness, stinginess, quarrels, disputes, conflicts and all such defilements. 

The second stage of happiness is concentration or Samadhi. When a person takes to meditation seriously he overcomes all forms of greed. Such a person is happy; like a man who is free of debt, free of ill will and free of sickness. He is happy like a man free from imprisonment or slavery. When a person knows that all these hindrances have left him; gladness arises in him. When the real happiness arises, the person does not express anything verbally or physically, but remains calm, peaceful, composed and serene for it is the real happiness that leads him to concentration. A truly happy person sees the truth as it is. 

The knowledge of the truth that all conditioned things are in a state of flux is the third stage, known as Panna or wisdom. The real knowledge of the truth makes a person wise enough to be really happy. Experiencing the truth of life that nothing is permanent and that it is not accidental, but happens to take place at every moment in our life is a pointer to the realization of wisdom. Most of the time our wisdom is not sharp enough to welcome the truth of life. Therefore, we tend to look the other way or pretend that it does not exist or try to run away from it. The wise however delight in reflecting on the truth that all conditioned things are impermanent. In whom are both concentration and wisdom he indeed is in the presence of Nibbana.

UN peacekeepers: Army assures cooperation to resolve screening issues
	
The Sri Lanka Army today assured that it would fully cooperate with the Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka (HRCSL) to resolve pending screening issues of UN peacekeepers.
In a statement, the Army said the bilateral understanding and coordination of the two entities would enable both parties to sort out the pending issues amicably as early as possible.
To be in line with the UN Secretary Generals decision in relation to screening of UN personnel for Human Rights, the Sri Lanka Army, consequent upon discussions with the Defence Ministry, Foreign Affairs Ministry, the UN Department of Peace Keeping Operations (UNDPKO) and the HRCSL resolved that an own national mechanism be followed with respect to independent screening of personnel through the HRCSL.
Accordingly, this national process of screening which needs the fullest cooperation of both the HRCSL and the armed forces for vetting UN bound own members came into effect early this year, although previous such clearance procedures were executed by authorities in the UN Human Rights Commission in Geneva, the Army said.
It said the Sri Lanka Army had accordingly begun the submission of details of Army personnel selected for UN missions for HRCSLs independent vetting.
In the meantime, UNDPKO in constant touch with the Sri Lanka Army has been inquiring into reasons, attributable to delayed dispatches of Sri Lankan troops for scheduled rotational releases as agreed upon.
The Sri Lanka Army would always cooperate with the HRCSL for clearance of any backlog since information that had been produced by the Army for screening in some cases could also contain shortcomings, complications, discrepancies, due to operational commitments, change of residential addresses, etc, the Army said.
At present, Sri Lankan troops, majority being from the Sri Lanka Army have been deployed in Lebanon (UNIFIL), South Sudan (UNMISS), Mali (MINUSMA), Abyei (UNISFA), New York (UNHQ), Central African Republic (MINUSCA) and Western Sahara (MINURSO), either as military observers, liaison officers, staff officers, staff officer assistants or general contingent troops for peace keeping. To-date a total of 450 Sri Lankan peace keepers are serving 7 UN peace keeping overseas missions under the UNDPKO.

UNP has many candidates: MP Indunil
	
The United National Party (UNP) had enough alternate candidates to field at the next Presidential Election if the present party leader Ranil Wickremesinghe declined to contest, Government MP Thusara Indunil Perera said yesterday.
He told a media briefing that his party had several alternative candidates to field, unlike the Joint Opposition, which solely depended on the members of the Rajapaksa family.
The UNP could always field Deputy Leader Sajith Premadasa as the candidate and put forward Minister Navin Dissanayake if Mr Premadasa refuses to contest.
The party can also consider Harin Fernando, Akila Viraj Kariyawasam or even Ruwan Wijewardene if all three seniors, namely Mr Wickremesinghe, Mr Premadasa and Mr Dissanayake refuse to contest, he said.
One cannot understand as to why the Joint Opposition is depending on either former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, Former Defence Secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa or on Former Minister Basil Rajapaksa, he said.
We would like to question whether the Joint Opposition has no other candidate other than the Rajapaksas, he said.
Responding to a question raised by journalists as to whether the Prime Minister had expressed his willingness to contest at the Presidential Election, the MP said the party had not discussed the matter yet.
He said the usual practice was that the party leader becomes the candidate at a Presidential Election. However, he said the UNP had many candidates if the need be.
Meanwhile, the UNP MP said his party did not oppose to the arrest of Bodu Bala Sena General Secretary Venerable Galagodaaththe Gnanasara Thera and neither would it oppose the granting of bail.
We hope that the Venerable Thera will develop a mature mindset, he said. (Yohan Perera)

Will take stern action if PC polls delayed: EC
	
Elections Commission Chairman Mahinda Deshapriya at a meeting with the representatives of the political parties decided to request Local Government and Provincial Councils Minister Faiszer Mustapha in writing not to delay the elections to the Provincial Councils any longer, it is learnt.
Mr Deshapriya reportedly vowed to take stern action if the elections were postponed.
He said he would try all possible means to ensure that the elections were conducted in time. He said there were provisions in the 19th Amendment to the Constitution that give power to the Elections Commission to take action.
Conducting of elections is not the sole business of the Commission. We cannot run the affairs of the Elections Commission, without discussing politics, he said quoting the relevant section of the law at the meeting.
Representatives of political parties were critical of the Government for not conducting the elections for the Provincial Councils.
They also discussed that there would be technical issues in conducting the elections under the new system.
The Commission stressed the need to sort them out if the Government opted to conduct the polls under the new formula.
The elections are already overdue for the North-Central, Eastern and Sabaragamuwa Provincial Councils.
Besides, the terms of the Central, Northern and Northwestern Provincial Councils would end this year warranting elections to them. (Kelum Bandara)
