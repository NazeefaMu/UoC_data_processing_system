He is poised to make U-turn!
	
	This particular Diyawanna member with a name reminding one of Sri Krishna of Bhagavad-Gita fame, hailing from the upcountry is about to make news again, they say.
Receiving a brief case filled with greenbacks from Santa Claus may have been a mere dream he cherished. He, no doubt, believed that his dream was about to come true, when a broker from the rival camp unexpectedly promised to deliver exactly the same if he switched his allegiance to the Compassionate One. It was a tall order which required him to renounce his high position and the numerous perks attached to it which he had just begun enjoying. However, the offer was so alluring he took the plunge!
However, the broker broke the promise and the Diyawanna member furious over this let-down threatened the former that he would make a U-turn if they failed to deliver what he was promised within two days.
Meanwhile, the news about the disgruntled pole-vaulter reached the palace and the courtiers are said to be calling him back to the fold with an assurance of a warm welcome.

	?The intention was very clear from our side. We were there to promote and conduct eye camps on behalf of Being Human. Salman has been doing eye camps in Sri Lanka and we always wanted to go there. But we had less time so the event was not as successful as we thought it would be. Politics was not in the picture at all,? Jacky said.
	?I can understand the sentiments of people but I have never spoken about my political views whether it is in India or Sri Lanka. For me it was a joyous time. I was there in my own country and Salman was with me for a charity event. It was a brilliant opportunity. We were there to spread awareness. What made me more sad was that no one asked us anything before writing such stories,? added the Sri Lankan beauty.
	Jacqueline, who was last seen in Kick opposite Salman, believes that her stagnant career has got new rhythm post working with him.
	Besides, Jacqueline's name has also been linked up with Salman while filming Kick.

Foreign Minister Mangala Samaraweera lodged a complaint with the CID this afternoon, requesting an immediate investigation into an alleged conspiracy that was hatched at Temple Trees, which, if successful would have dealt a hammer blow to Sri Lanka?s democracy.
Minister Samaraweera, speaking to media outside the offices of the CID, said that he had handed over all the details of the alleged plan to the CID on the matter and he had also given a statement concerning the plan that was allegedly hatched by former President Mahinda Rajapaksa and his brother, former Defense Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa, together with several other top officials of the government, to subvert the democratic process in the country in the wee hours of January 9.
He said they had been reliably informed of a plan which had been hatched at Temple Trees to suspend the Presidential election result and implement emergency law in the country, in the early hours of January 9. ?
?Part of the plan had been to surround the Elections Department using military personnel from the Panagoda camp and bend the Elections Commissioner to their will and create a dangerous situation in the country,? he added.
However, he said that the brave actions of the IGP, Army Commander and the Attorney General, Yuvanjan Wijeyathileka, in standing up against the plan and refusing to follow the orders, ensured that democracy in the oldest democracy in Asia was preserved. (Lakna Paranamanna)

?I want to tell all my supporters that these allegations have no basis. More than being angered, I am saddened. While we never claimed to be perfect, we always had the best interest of the country and the Sri Lankan people in mind,? Mr. Rajapaksa said.
?This is true not only of Mahinda Rajapaksa but of us as his children as well. We were brought up to take responsibility for our actions. As such, if I have done any wrong, I am fully prepared to face the consequences. However, I am certain of my innocence with regard to the outrageous allegations that have been put forth against me, he added.The full statement issued by MP Namal Rajapaksa
Baseless Allegations
Dear supporters and friends,
As you may have already heard, certain individuals are coming after me with a vengeance, trying to implicate me in a number of alleged wrongdoings. We expected this. Those who are older than I am will remember well that this is the usual fate that members of the SLFP must suffer whenever we lose elections. It has happened in the past, and the same is happening this time also.
As a politician, coming after me is OK because I have the strength and support system to face it. But unfortunately, I?m not the only one. Many of our strong supporters ? ordinary citizens ? from around the country have also undergone various types of harassment. Most of these individuals didn?t break the law ? they only supported Mahinda Rajapaksa, and they are being punished for that choice.
I appeal to the new President to take measures to safeguard our supporters around the country and to take action against those who are carrying out this harassment. I hope he will remember that these supporters of Mahinda Rajapaksa were once strong supporters of his as well, so please ensure their safety.
We welcome the new government?s initiatives of ?good governance,? but we make a strong appeal not to allow certain individuals misuse this initiative to fulfill personal vendettas under the guise of ?good governance.?

Pope visits Mahabodhi Temple in Maradana
	
Pope Francis made a surprise visit to the Mahabodhi Temple in Maradana late this evening and viewed the sacred relics of the Buddha's disciples, Papal spokesman Fr. Federico Lombardi said today.
Fr. Lombardi said at a media briefing that the Pope had removed his shoes before entering the temple and had spent a few minutes of silence there.
He said the Holy Father had decided to visit the temple at short notice after he had been invited by the chairperson of the Mahabodhi Organisation, the Venerable Banagala Uptissa Thera when the latter met him at Bandaranaike International Airport on Tuesday.
This was the first time a pope had visited a Buddhist Temple in Sri Lanka said Fr. Cyril Gamini, the spokesman for the Roman Catholic Church in Sri Lanka.
The Pope had also met Mr. Mahinda Rajapaksa at the apostolate nuncio's residence on Bauddhaloka Mawatha.
The Pope had also made a surprise visit to the Archbishop's House to meet the bishops but they had not yet retuned from Madhu and he had had to visit the Archbishop?s House again later. This time the bishops were praying when he got there and he had joined them in prayer. (Yohan Perera)Picture courtesy REUTERS

	A scriptwriter was fine tuning a film script that had to be ready within a day or two. He had been working on it for quite some time. Since the shoot had been scheduled in three days, he was making last minute changes in consultation with the author of the story.
Most of the corrections were being done through ?SMS?. The author, who lived far away, makes a suggestion about some dialogues of a character and the scriptwriter responds. Then he suggests another change. This had been going for some days especially in the nights which annoyed the scriptwriter?s wife.
?There should be some meaning to this. He sends you text messages. You respond and make the amendments and then he sends another message, you reply. There is no end to this. Remember you worked on this script till 4 am yesterday and now it?s almost 2 am. Your author should also understand that you are human,? she grumbled but the scriptwriter hinted that he was vulnerable.
?Even I feel so tired and sleepy but what can I do when the author wants the script and dialogues to be perfect? ?
?Ok then listen, when he texts you next time, you reply and just say GOOD NIGHT at the end. That will make him realise it?s time to call it a day,? she suggested.

?The release at this juncture of the fishermen reflects yet again the desire of the two countries to address matters relating to detained fishermen in an expeditious manner. This demonstrates the goodwill and understanding which exists bilaterally and is a manifestation of the warm and abiding relationship,? the foreign affairs ministry said in a statement.
It also said that there are also 87 boats of Indian fishermen which have been detained in instances over a period of time, and are presently in Sri Lankan judicial custody.

	While claiming that former President Mahinda Rajapaksa should be taken to Hague for? alleged war crimes, Maya Arulpragasam, the Sri Lankan Tamil recording artist said that Sri Lanka's new government has the ?same face? as it includes politicians who have been involved in government for the last 30 years.
	She said the Tamil community had embraced democracy and peace - the Tamil vote was largely responsible for Sirisena's election - and that now the government had to restore "basic needs" to the community.
	She told Channel 4 News that reconciliation can only come if the Sri Lankan government undoes some of the Rajapaksa regime's actions, such as his militarisation of Tamil areas in the country's north.
	On the UN inquiry, Arulpragasam said "we still want Rajapaksa to go to the Hague", but that peace in Sri Lanka's post-war period was a priority for Tamils. In the years since the war there have been continued allegations of ongoing abuses such as "enforced disappearances" of Tamils and government opponents.
