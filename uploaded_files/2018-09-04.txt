Tense situation in Parliament
	
Parliament sessions ended abruptly today after the joint opposition stormed the Well of the House claiming that the government was trying sabotage tomorrow's 'Jana Balaya Kolambata' protest rally.
However, the government rushed through two laws including one on the payment of remuneration to employees of the Office of Missing Persons. An adjournment debate which was to be moved by the JO was not taken up as a result of the commotion.
The trouble began after MP Dinesh Gunawardene asked why the government was trying to sabotage the protest by obtaining stay orders from Courts.
?Welikada police had gone to courts to obtain a stay order against the protest saying it will risk the security of the parliamentary complex. The police have done this on orders from the top,? he said.
The MP said the permits obtained by various people to hire private buses had also been cancelled.
JO MPs Dallas Allahapperuma and Prasanmna Ranatunga said the government had denied buses to the devotees who were visiting the church of Our Lady of Matara for the annual feast.
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe who responded said the police could always obtain a stay order on a protest under the Privileges Act to allow the MPs to come to Parliament without any hindrance.
?The Police do not need orders to ensure the safety of MPs,? he said and added that only one transport authority is under the purview of the government while the provincial authorities do not come under the central government and therefore the government does not have the power to stop the hiring of private buses.
Law and Order Minister Ranjith Madduma Bandara said the government had not obtained any stay order to stop the protest but had taken steps to ensure the safety of the people.
Members on both sides were arguing for some time while House Leader Lakshman Kiriella moved the Bills and motions.?
JVP MP Sunil Handunetti rose to speak as the debate was underway but suddenly the government decided to go for a vote and it was announced that the Bills and motions were duly passed.
Speaker then called for the adjournment debate but the House was adjourned moments later thus ending the sessions for the day. (Yohan Perera and Ajith Siriwardana)

To nurture a culture of safety in Sri Lanka Association FORMED TO HANDLE Disaster Risk Management
	
President Maithripala Sirisena (centre) launches the official web domain of the organisation
?
In comparison to the disaster situations in 2016 and 2017, sri lanka has faced disasters more successfully
	This year the Government was not criticised nor condemned in the media due to its efficient response in managing disaster situations
?
With both natural and man-made disasters becoming frequent, the need for a professional forum of disaster risk management professionals has been long felt in Sri Lanka. With the vision of providing a professional discussion forum relating to disaster and climate risk management in the country, the Association aof Disaster Risk Management Professionals in Sri Lanka (ADRiMP) was launched recently.? ?
ADRiMP is an assembly of professionals representing varied disciplines to nurture a culture of safety in Sri Lanka associated with the impact of disasters. The professional body also aspires to provide a platform for dialogue to achieve effective implementation of the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction (2015-2030) and the Paris Agreement (2015 - 2030) for combating climate change and advocacy for policy initiatives.? ?
Dr. Buddhi Weerasinghe, the association?s president, possesses over 20 years experience in Disaster Risk Management. Weerasinghe commenced his work in 1996 with the pioneering project in Sri Lanka under the Asian Urban Disaster Mitigation Program of the Asian Disaster Preparedness Center (ADPC), Bangkok.? ?
At the launch of the association, Dr. Weerasinghe, addressing the gathering, noted the significant contributions made by professionals, scholars, academia international and local non-governmental organisations which have been vital in the establishment of the association.? ?
?Our vision is to provide a forum for dialogue across multi-disciplinary sectors which is essential for disaster risk management. The trend is to be isolated in compartments within our own independent institutions and fields of study. It is time for us to combine our energies to bring new knowledge, to research and become a think tank for the country and to take informed decisions regarding the safety of Sri Lanka and our future generations,? Dr. Weerasinghe said.? ?
The chief guest at the event, President Maithripala Sirisena, launched the official web domain of the organisation; www.adrimp.org.lk. The State Minister of Irrigation, Water Resources and Disaster Management Palitha Range Bandara addressing the gathering said that the Government has been forced to deal with numerous disasters and hazards during its brief tenure.?
?Sri Lanka faced floods, landslides, strong winds and even droughts frequently over the past few years. During these disasters, the Government was able to combine all relevant sectors in order to successfully face these disasters,? the minister said.? ?
Minister Bandara was of the view that the Government has been able to prevent further disasters from taking place by mitigating risks of hazards. ?The professionals who were involved in these efforts have come together under one roof to work simultaneously,? he noted.?
The minster was confident that through effective initiatives led by professionals of the country?s disaster management sector, the Government could serve the public promptly and mitigate forthcoming disaster situations.? ?
?In comparison to the disaster situations in 2016 and 2017, we have faced disasters more successfully this year due to the efforts of the professionals present here today.?
Accordingly, 293 deaths were reported during the previous disaster period.?
However there have been only 24 deaths reported during the disaster situations this year,? the Minister observed. The Minister added that while 5 of these deaths were reported due to lightning, the majority had been caused due to the negligence of the public.? ?
?This year the Government was not criticised nor condemned in the media due to its efficient response in managing disaster situations. Relief was provided promptly while victims were not only safely sheltered, but also provided with compensation within a matter of 24 hours,? he added.??
?The Minister was also of the belief that the Meteorology Department is at present able to issue accurate and timely weather forecasts as opposed to misleading bulletins issued earlier.? ?Huddersfield University?s Professor of Disaster Risk Management and Reduction Dilanthi Amaratunga, who is also the Head of its Global Disaster Resilience Centre, delivered the keynote address of the event.?
?Prof. Amaratunga noted that while there has been a major shift in the focus of thinking in terms of disaster management, it is imperative for ADRiMP to facilitate knowledge sharing and capacity development in order to support policy makers and research.? ?

UNP challenges JO to topple Govt.
	
While saying that the Government was neither scared nor interested in the JO protest scheduled to be held tomorrow, Law & Order Deputy Minister Nalin Bandara challenged JO members to topple the Government.
Addressing a news briefing, he said that the JO members had emphasized on several occasions that they would topple the Government by means of this protest campaign.
?They boast saying that a large crowd will accompany them in the endeavour to topple the Government. People are not that much stupid to join hands with them,? the Deputy Minister said.
?This is not the first time that these JO members are marching to Colombo. There have been protest marches prior to this one and none of them produced good results. Likewise, this also would become a dead duck,? he added.? ? ?
??He said that although there was an allegation that the Government attempted to sabotage the protest, it had no such intention.? (Sheain Fernandopulle)

## Title: Wanted a candidate for 2019 Myth and fallacy Of 50% plus for Presidency
## Section: Opinion
## Date: 4 September 2018 12:10 am
Wanted a candidate for 2019 Myth and fallacy Of 50% plus for Presidency
	
?
Sri Lankan voter, though highly literate, lacked the ability to apprehend the true nature of politics
	?If so happens, it could be worse than the present animosity, enmity and bitterness among the heads??
?
?Nothing is so exhausting as indecision, and nothing is so futile.?
?Bertrand Russell
Quite a few politicians from both sides of the divide have expressed their views on the conduct of Presidential Elections stating that for any candidate aspiring to become the Executive President of Sri Lanka, needs to obtain 50% plus one vote out of the valid votes counted, as the minimum requirement for the Commissioner of Elections to declare the candidate winner.
The latest to make this claim in a ?voice cut? was none other than the former General Secretary and current National Organizer of a main political party. He even went a step further describing the process and said if each of the three main parties fielded a candidate; no one would be able to achieve this minimum requirement causing a stalemate? and the country would become unable to elect a President!
This is a fallacy.
Let?s refer to- Presidential Elections Act, No. 15 of 1981- [Presidential Elections (Amendment) Act, No. 16 of 1988--does not deal with counting and declaration of a winner]
PART IV --THE COUNT , [quoting the above In a nutshell]
Sections 56,57,58,59 and 60 :
The Commissioner ascertains if any candidate has received more than 50% of valid votes and the candidate receiving more than 50% declared elected. If no candidate receives absolute majority?where there are three candidates, eliminate the last candidate and count the second/third preferences of eliminated candidate as a vote in favour of other two; or if there are more than three eliminate the rest leaving first and second to count the second preference of eliminated as a vote in favour of remaining candidates; and where the second preference is not counted, to count the third preference for one or the other of the remaining two candidates, as a vote in favour of such remaining candidate. Returning officer to add preferences and prepare a fresh statement. The returning officer shall prepare a statement indicating the number of second preferences and third preferences specified in favour of the remaining two candidates.
Sec. 61. The Commissioner shall, on receipt of the statements thereby ascertain which of the remaining two candidates has received the majority of the votes so counted and forthwith declare the candidate who has obtained such majority to be elected to the office of President.
It is obvious that there is no necessity for the winner to obtain ?50% plus one vote.?
In fact a candidate receiving a percentage even as low as 10% can be elected President, if there are more than two candidates and say each receiving, 9.8, 9.8, 8.6, 8.3?., in any descending order to total 100%, and if one of the first two after adding the eliminated candidates second and third preferences, yet there is a strong possibility that the percentage revolves around 10% or less.
There is no minimum cut-off point: take a hypothetical case, if there are 30 or 40 candidates who are almost equally popular, a 2 to 3 per cent of valid votes would be sufficient for one to become the Executive President of Sri Lanka.
Elections before December 9, 2019
As per Article 31(3) of the Constitution, December 9, 2019, is the last day by which Presidential Election will have to be held because it says, one month ahead of the end of President Sirisena?s term, which ends on January 9, 2020.
Who will represent POHOTTUWA?
The battle [indecision] over SLPP candidate heats up. Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa?s new party is divided among Mahinda Chintana, Viyath Maga and Chamal factions. [It is not clear if there is a move to promote Basil too, making it a?four-cornered contest]
President Sirisena made a reference to the SC seeking its view if he could serve for six years. He sought the Court?s interpretation whether there is any obstacle to him to continue his term of office for six years as President as described in the Article 31 of the 19th Amendment, in terms of Article 129(1) of?the Constitution.
The AG arguing in support of President Sirisena stated that the election was held on January 8, 2015, and the incumbent President Sirisena won and assumed duty on January 9, 2015, for the term of office for six years. He proposed that the incumbent President was elected by the voters for the office, to the term of six years.
He said:
?It is the sovereignty of the citizens who exercise their franchise to choose by ballot him as President. The power originated from the franchise of the people. The beginning of his office should be measured from the date on which he is elected.?
He further said it is the Constitutional structure where the sitting President was elected. The 19th Amendment is operative after the President was elected for a term of six years.
?There are no provisions in the 19th Amendment to operate same with retrospective effect. Constitutions cannot be amended with retrospective effect,? the Attorney General said making submissions.
He asserted that any adjustment would affect and isolate the Sovereignty of the voter.
President Sirisena?s request to the Apex Court came as a surprise for many as he made arrangements in 2015 through the 19th Amendment to prune the Presidential term from six to five years, in fact, the President sought to make it four, but others intervened and proposed five.
The SC took up the reference to make a ruling on the vagueness over the question of the term of office. The five-member bench of the SC unanimously ruled that his term was restricted to five years.
President Sirisena?s appeal to the Supreme Court caused quite a rouse, when former President Rajapaksa declared that he could contest again if the court ruled in favour of Sirisena.
Gamini Laxman Peiris, the leader of SLPP [Pohottuwa] and former Law Professor will move the District Court, in terms of the Article 125 of the Constitution seeking an elucidation as regards Chandrika Bandaranaike?s and Mahinda Rajapaksa?s eligibility to hand over nominations for the presidential election in 2019.
The District Court, as he believes could refer the matter to SC for a ruling. According to him, within two months the Supreme Court will have to make its decision known to the District Court.
GL Peiris said that the office of President under the 19th Amendment was entirely different from the powers granted to it by the 1978 Constitution.
The Chairman of the new party said that it would be relevant to mention that the Presidency established under Article 30 of the 1978 Constitution couldn?t be weighed against with the Article 3 of the 19th Amendment, which repealed Article 30.
Wide-ranging and comprehensive changes had been initiated in the office of President in respect of the appointment of the cabinet, the number of portfolios the President could hold, dissolution of Parliament, dismissing PM among them.
However, the truth is that former President Rajapaksa?s camp is looking for a Supreme Court ruling on 19th Amendment against the background of his family?s failure to reach a consensus and compromise on who or which Rajapaksa is going to be the Opposition?s candidature for the next Presidential Election due in end 2019, or even earlier if the incumbent president who becomes eligible to call for a poll any time after the lapse of four years, that is on 9th January 2019.
For the first time since 2005, Rajapaksa family who ruled as a team is experiencing the darker side of such groupings.
Family problems come in all forms, shapes and sizes; some are short-lived and easily administered, while others are more chronic and complicated. We do not know if Rajapakas? are short-lived or chronic, but it cannot be allowed to extend beyond Medamulana and out into the national arena in the event of a victory to one of them at the next poll; If it so happened, it could be worse than the present animosity, enmity and bitterness among the heads of two partners of Unity Government, which has resulted in drastic consequences to the smooth operation of governance.
President Maithripala Sirisena?s Sri Lanka Freedom Party and Ranil Wickremesinghe?s United National Party, while ruling together, flexed muscles and competed against each other that ended with both suffering humiliating losses in the hands of novice [A world record?? emerging victorious defeating two established parties] in February?s elections; Will the governing coalition aspire to repeat the mistake in 2019?
More than ten names of potential UNF candidates are being rumoured to come forward if the leader, as he did twice in 2010 and 2015, backs out at the last moment. The strategy of a surprise, like in 2015, is unlikely to make an impact on the electorate any more.
For seventy years, the two political parties backed by the majority race dominated the political arena alternating power between them to rule the country. They cashed in on racial and religious emotions resulting in the nation suffering untold misery.
Sri Lankan voters, though highly literate, lacked the ability to apprehend the true nature of politics; especially through perceptive understanding.
With their moral values eroded, had taken decisions fashioned by the circumstances that prevailed. This allowed the roguish politicians and religious racists to make strides in politics.

## Title: BIMSTEC enters a new era with the Kathmandu summit

BIMSTEC enters a new era with the Kathmandu summit
	
?
The overall conditions remain as dismal as before, though there are rays of hope on the horizon
	The emerging Sino-Indian d?tente provides BIMSTEC a solid foundation for exponential growth
?
The Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC), which held its fourth Summit in Kathmandu on August 30 and 31, appears to have entered a new era, awakening from years of somnolence.
The first signs of an awakening appeared in 2014, when a Permanent Secretariat was established and a Secretary General was appointed, the first since the organization came into being in 1997.
Under the first Secretary General, Sumith Nakandala of Sri Lanka, BIMSTEC became a beehive of activity. Expert committees on multifarious economic and social developmental areas submitted reports on plans of action.
Not surprisingly, the Kathmandu Declaration expressed ?appreciation? of Nakandala?s ?valuable contribution to advancing the work of BIMSTEC.?
In 2017, at the end of his three year term, Nakandala passed on the torch to the Bangladeshi diplomat M. Shahidul Islam, who organized the fourth Summit this year. At the Fourth Summit the Nepalese Prime Minister K.P. Oli handed over the Chairmanship of BIMSTEC to the Sri Lankan President Maithripala Sirisena.
A tireless proponent of cross-border outreach, with unmatched experience in promoting cross cultural interaction as a Lankan diplomat, Sumith Nakandala believed that ?if the Bay of Bengal region was integrated in ancient times, it could be re-integrated again.?
Armed with that motto, Nakandala oversaw the conclusion of the BIMSTEC Convention on Suppression of Terrorism and the finalization of BIMSTEC Transport, Infrastructure and Logistics Study (BTILS) conducted by the Asian Development Bank. He got the ADB to offer its technical assistance in strengthening the BIMSTEC Secretariat.
?
How integration and joint development will be possible when the South Asian and the Bay of Bengal region have become so-politicized and militarized and visas are so difficult to get
Burdensome Backlog
However, given the 20 year backlog of expectations, much remains to be done. The overall conditions remain as dismal as before, though there are rays of hope on the horizon.
The BIMSTEC Free Trade Agreement was signed in 2004, but is yet to be implemented. The economies of the countries in South Asia are so protectionist that free trade is almost an unattainable objective. Non-Tariff Barriers reduce the advantages of tariff concessions. Bureaucracies in South Asia are chronically anti-free trade. The so-called ?national interests? also stand in the way. Sudip Dey, President of the Kolkata Customs Agents Association told a seminar in Dhaka that mutual fear blighted any prospect of free movement of goods. ?Unless the fear psychosis goes, cooperation can only be a dream,? he said. Admiral Dr Jayanath Colombage, an expert on maritime security, wonders how integration and joint development will be possible when the South Asian and the Bay of Bengal region have become so-politicized and militarized and visas are so difficult to get.? Regional disputes? and bilateral agreements, which member countries enter into for greater benefits, stand in the way of collectives like BIMSTEC.
Way Forward
However, the proceedings of the Kathmandu Summit clearly indicated that BIMSTEC is trying to chalk up a new path. One of the most important things that the Summit did was to resolve to have a Charter with clearly stated goals and an organizational system to delivery on ideas propounded by the Heads of Government.
The Charter is expected to clearly delineate the role and responsibilities of the different layers of the institutional structure and decision-making processes.
It was also decided to establish a Permanent Working Group to deal with financial and administrative matters of the BIMSTEC Secretariat and other BIMSTEC entities. The Working Group would also prepare schedules of meetings and prioritize and rationalize the organization?s activities.
Coming to the question of projects, while BIMSTEC has given itself many functions, the most important of them will be connectivity, from now onwards.
The emphasis on connectivity is largely due to Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi?s passion for multi-modal connectivity across borders, probably inspired by Xi Jinping?s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI).
?
?
Like Xi, Modi wants to go beyond the traditional confines of trade and investment. Like Xi, Modi is hopes to use connectivity projects to project his country?s power, capability and strategic reach.
The BIMSTEC Declaration said that it would establish ?Seamless multi-modal transportation linkages and smooth and synchronized and simplified transit facilities through the development, expansion, and modernization of highways, railways, waterways, sea routes and airways.?
?With China frenetically promoting infrastructural development and connectivity in all the countries in BIMSTEC (barring India), New Delhi had had no option but to take up similar projects in order not to lose support in the neighbourhood and beyond. Thus, India is now part of the Bangladesh, Bhutan, India and Nepal (BBIN) sub-regional hub. It is also part of the Bangladesh, China, India, Myanmar (BCIM) Economic Corridor proposed under Beijing?s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI).
Making Up With China
India is China?s rival, and the two Asian giants are competing for strategic space in the South and South East Asian region and even in Africa. And yet, at another level, India has realized that it cannot disregard China and act entirely independently. With relations with the Trump Administration in the US not exactly warm, India is looking for fresh pastures and cooperation with China is seen as a fresh pasture.
China?s well-funded infrastructural programme under BRI has made India sit up and take notice of what is happening in its neighbourhood. All the countries in BIMSTEC have signed up with the BRI and are to execute BRI projects, throwing up a challenge to India in a manner of speaking.
There is another point to be considered too. With China?s massive presence, Indian or BIMSTEC infrastructural projects, even if conceived and executed separately, will have to coordinate with BRI projects to make them economically viable.
Fortunately, countries like Nepal, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Myanmar, which have close relations with both India and China, are eager to bring the two Asian giants to cooperate for economic benefits as well as security.
India does not accept BRI on the grounds that the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), which is part of BRI, passes through Gilgit-Baltistan claimed by India. But pragmatic New Delhi has accepted all other projects under BRI, albeit as a fait accompli.
Recently India said that it would give China access to Chittagong Port in Bangladesh. China too has said that it did not insist that India should endorse BRI formally and that it was ready to work with India on commercial basis.
The emerging Sino-Indian d?tente provides BIMSTEC a solid foundation for exponential growth.

Commission on SriLankan: 'Cancellation of airbus leases caused heavy losses'
	
SriLankan Airlines suffered a loss of Rs. 14.3 billion (USD 90.5 million) due to the cancellation of three Airbus A350-900 leases and it amounted to half of the losses in the financial year 2016-2017, it was revealed at the Presidential Commission of Inquiry (PCoI) on irregularities at SriLankan Airlines, SriLankan Catering and Mihin Lanka yesterday.
Financial Management Head Yasantha Dissanayake informed the Commission that in 2016 SriLankan had agreed to terminate four Airbus A350-900 leases which were executed under the present management.
He told the Commission that SriLankan Airlines made a profit of Rs. 568 million in the financial year 2006-2007 and Rs. 4.4 billion in the financial year 2007-2008. He also notified the most of the profits which were gained by the SriLankan was earned by selling and leasing aircraft.
He informed the Commission that that SriLankan has been making losses since the departure of Emirates.
?According to the annual report of 2008-2009 soon after Emirates left, SriLankan made a loss of Rs. 9.3 billion during then Chairman Nishantha Wickremasinghe?s period,? he said.
?The loss was Rs.2.69 billion in financial year 2006-2010 and it dropped to Rs. 381 million in financial year 2010-2011. However in financial year 2011-2012, after Kaplia Chandrasena was appointed as the CEO the loss increased again up to Rs. 19.6 billion. In financial year 2012-2013 it was increased up to 21.7 billion and accordingly in financial year 2013-2014 the loss had increased up to 32.4 billion,? he said while referring to the annual reports.
He also informed the Commission the losses had continued in financial year 2014-2015 up to Rs. 16.4 billion after the present management was appointed. ?Accordingly, financial year 2015-2016 it was decreased to a level of Rs. 12.6 billion and financial year 2016-2017 it again increased up to 28.9 billion,? he said.
It was also revealed that after Emirates left the airlines, when Government took over the SriLankan, no representative from the Government Treasury had not appointed as a member to the Directors Board of SriLankan airlines, since the government is the main shareholder of the institution. Dissanayake also informed the Commission that the Government ownes 99% of shares in SriLankan and the Government had directly pumped Rs. 46.6 billion into the airlines since 2012.

Death risk in Mediterranean soars: UN
	
?
DPA, 03rd SEPTEMBER, 2018- The risk of dying in the central Mediterranean Sea has jumped to one in 18 for migrants this year as non-governmental rescue ships are facing difficulties on this key route to Europe, the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) said Monday.
Last year, one in 42 migrants died or went missing while trying to sail to Italy on the central Mediterranean between January and July.
?A major factor contributing to the increased death rate is the decreased search and rescue capacity off the Libyan coast this year,? the Geneva-based UNHCR said, noting that two vessels of the Libyan coast guard have effectively taken over the rescue work that was handled by eight NGO vessels in 2017. While humanitarian rescue groups have reported harassment and threats from the Libyan coast guard, they have also faced landing blockades and legal punishment in Italy.
UNHCR noted that refugees and migrants are now ?travelling on overcrowded and unsafe vessels for long periods and over further distances prior to detection and rescue..? Among the more than 1,600 people who have died or gone missing while trying to reach Europe on various routes since January, 1,095 have perished in the central Mediterranean.

	When they were informed earlier about this matter the family had pleaded with the authorities
?
The residents of a house, where they had lived for seventeen years, had been ejected on August 29 (Wednesday) due to a court order. The chief occupant of this residence is Warnakulasuriya Neville Fernando and lives in Manaveriya Arachchikatuwa. He is the father of two children.??
The aggrieved family said that they had lived at this place for the past 17 years. They were not rich and at the time they arrived here they did not have proper employment. They had initially begun planting coconut seedlings and build a small house. Neville Fernando said that he had worked as a railway line labourer and the income he derived was not sufficient for him to build a house. On the day they were evicted from the house all their belongings had been thrown out. The court order has been issued stating that this is an unauthorised construction. When they were informed earlier about this matter the family had pleaded with the authorities not to evict them from the house and throw them onto the road.??
?
An officer representing the courts, who arrived at this home, had informed that they were unauthorized to stay at this property.? Instructions had been given earlier for the unauthorised settlers to vacate the premises because the land had been confiscated under the Land Acquisition act and therefore legal measures had been taken.??
When this matter was posed to the OIC of the Arachchikattuwa Police Anuradha Herath, he said that it was his duty to provide security for the court officials to carry out the orders? ???

FEASTING ON PUBLIC FUNDS
	
A series of recent news reports begs attention of the people. They point the scant regard shown by the so-called people?s representatives -- the members of the Parliament, provincial councils and the local government bodies, on the plights of the people they are said to be representing. Here are some of the reports:??
The proposal to increase the allowance of Members of the Colombo Municipal Council (CMC) by Rs.20,000 was passed at the sessions held on August 24, said one report. The proposal had been presented by Mayoress Rosy Senanayaka, and accordingly, the monthly allowance of a Member of CMC that was Rs.34,000, would increase to Rs.54,000.??
The controversy over the order placed by the Western Provincial Council to purchase 125 luxury chairs for the council chambers at the newly-built building complex of the council in Battaramulla has not been sorted out yet. According to reports, the chairs which are to be imported (from Belgium according to the JVP but from Spain according to Western Province Chief Minister Isura Devapriya) have been priced at Rs. 640,000 and that would cost the council a massive Rs. 67.5 million. The purchase was temporarily suspended by Western Province Governor Hemakumara Nanayakkara at the request of JVP councillor Lakshman Nipunaarachchci.? ?
One step above, at Parliament level, there was a move in July to increase the salaries of ministers, deputy ministers, state ministers and all parliamentarians by approximately 215% to be on par with the recent salary increase given to Judges.? ?
According to the reports, the salary increment was to be effective from January this year and that it was to be paid in August with the arrears. Accordingly, the salary of an MP would increase from Rs.54,285 to Rs.120,000 while the salary of a deputy minister goes up from Rs.63,500 to 135,000 while the salary of a minister and a state minister would be increased from Rs.65,000 to Rs.140, 000. However, the move was postponed at the instance of President Maithripala Sirisena. Another move to pay a monthly allowance of Rs. 200,000 for monitoring MPs has also been suspended by the President.? ?
Meanwhile, in an interesting turn of events, the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption (CIABOC) has cleared the way for lawmakers to sell super luxury vehicles imported under special duty-free scheme available for parliamentarians since the 1970s. Secretary to the CIABOC R.M.V. Shanthi Jayasekera has asserted that the transfer of vehicles imported by lawmakers wasn?t contrary to the Bribery and Corruption law. Jayasekera was responding to Attorney-at-law and public litigation activist Nagananda Kodituwakku, who, soon after the present government assumed office in 2015, moved the Supreme Court against the CIABOC for not initiating action against those who sold their vehicles.??
The politicians say that they need luxury vehicles at concessionary price as they have to toil day and night working for the people, but once they get the vehicles they are being sold. Now it is not illegal either.??
Western Province Chief Minister had justified the order placed for the chairs claiming that his council was in the historic Kotte Kingdom and the council should mirror the grandeur of the Kingdom while Mayor Senanayake had stated that she had taken steps to renovate the toilets according to the ?advice of an expert from the Department of Archaeology on renovating the official bungalow and preserving it as a place of archaeological value.???
The figures in these stories do not in any way reflect the correct amounts involved in maintaining these people?s representatives, as another recent report had said, for instance, that the government spends Rs.7.5 million a month to maintain a Cabinet Minister.??
One does not need to go deep into these reports as they clearly reflect the attitude of the so-called people?s representatives towards taxpayers? money. Only the fact that more than 3000 schools in the country do not have toilet and drinking water facilities suffice to gauge their concern about the people who vote them into power.?

Homeless ex-jailer authoring book on Vijaya
	
Shelton Kurera
?
He was the one who was in charge of the security of Vijaya Kumaratunga, who had been imprisoned during the J.R.Jayewardene regime due to allegations that he had links with the so-called Naxalite Groups
?
A jailer is held in high esteem in our society as a responsible Government officer in charge of prisoners. However, he or she has to depend on the pension entitled to him/her after retirement. This is a sad story of a jailer who had been deprived of the pension. At present he spends life amidst numerous hardships, even without a shelter.? ?
We came across a retired jailer who was employed in the Prison Department for about 18 years. But now he has got used to eking out a livelihood by doing manual work given to him by somebody. In the absence of work he survives by eating something given by somebody in order to satisfy his hunger. Without help from anybody, he spends the nights at a bus stand or on a door-step of a business premises.? ?
?He was a former jailer and a resident of Marawila in Mahawewa. His name is Shelton Kurera, who is 70, and living the twilight years of his life.?
?
However, he is compelled to live in this manner by doing manual work due to the fact that he was deprived of his pension. He told ?Lankadeepa? that he had to spend his life in this manner after the death of his father and his mother who had died in 2009.? ?
When delving into the history of this jailer we found that he was the one who was in charge of the security of the popular actor- turned politician Vijaya Kumaratunga, who had been imprisoned during the J.R.Jayewardene regime due to allegations that he had links with the so-called Naxalite Groups.? ?
Being well-versed in writing, he has started to write a book about ?The life and times? of Vijaya Kumaratunga, a piece of writing which will include the time spent by him in prison. With the help of a bulb fixed on an electric post and emitting light-the post is situated near a walking path close to the ?wewa? in Mahawewa town- he writes this book while resting on a bench close by. He writes until night fall, till its time to go and sleep.? ?
On the condition that nothing should be asked about his two children, he began to pour out his life story. This is his story.? ?
Interdicted
? I joined the Department of Prisons as a prison guard in 1972. Later I was promoted to the post of jailer. I worked in several prisons and out-door prison camps. When I was employed at the Welikada Prison, I fell sick all of a sudden. Having reported sick, I obtained treatment. While I was being treated, my wife died due to an accident. I became jobless in 1986, as I forgot to forward my medical report in due time. Due to the reason that I helped Vijaya Kumaratunga, who had been imprisoned on the allegations regarding the Naxalite connections, I was interdicted at that time. However, I was reinstated in in the department following a period of interdiction which lasted for 12 days in the year 1983,? he recalled.? ?
He added that his mother had died in 2009 and after that he had been left in the lurch. According to him, he had got used to living on the road, without any assistance from anybody and depended on handouts given by the people. He indulged in manual work as well for his survival. There were times when he took shelter at a bus stand. He has spent numerous days without food. For a period of about nine years he has spent his life this way.? ?
He said that he had to face a strange experience one day. When he was sleeping on a door-step of a business stall in Marawila town, he had been taken to the police along with some others who were on the street. But, he had not been remanded because one policeman had identified him. He was not produced before the court due to this reason.? ?
What he stressed while relating his life-story was that he was trying his best to obtain his pension. In spite of the fact that the relevant authorities having recommended for him to receive his pension, he has not received it. He would not have suffered this way, if he had received his pension, he says. He wishes to receive a pension. He said that if his pension can be arranged it would be a meritorious act. Kurera had worked as the Editor of the monthly magazine titled ?Sannivedana?, a publication of the Department of Prisons at that time. He showed some of editions of this magazine to us.? ?
In conclusion, he said that he was well-aware of the time that Vijaya had spent in prison because he was in charge of his security. According to him, he has high hopes of completing the book about the late actor in the future. He completes parts of this book when time permits.?

I have read President?s mind-Vasu
	
?
?
Political change is imminent?
	Mahinda Rajapaksa as PM is the alternative?
	No public utterances on presidential candidate?
	UNP means everything bad?in this country
	I am for a Unitary State with provincial powers
	There is a serious competition between President and?Prime Minister
	the presidential election could begin earlier if the current President decided?to contest
?
Joint Opposition MP Vasudeva Nanayakkara, in an interview with Daily mirror , shares his thoughts on the current political developments in the country. Mr Nanayakkara, who is the leader of the Democratic Left Front, sees that a political change is imminent in the country.?
Excerpts:?
?
QThere are different opinions being expressed by you and others in the Joint Opposition about the presidential candidate to be fielded next time. How will it affect the unity of the Joint Opposition at the end?
We discussed this matter. It was decided that we should not have this debate in public until we discussed it internally and arrive at a consensus. Until then, none of us should be speaking. None should be going around saying a such and such person is the candidate.? ?
QYet, some MPs like Kumara Welgama speak about it. Isn?t it?
You cannot stop people from speaking. But it is not us. We have agreed not to speak about it.? ?
QYou had taken up a position on the person to be chosen as the candidate. How serious are you in that position?
I am very serious. I think the winning candidate has to draw a section of the democratic forces, leftist forces, centre forces, minorities and the youth. The candidate should be able to get a combination of these votes. That is what I contemplate on. I am very serious again.? ?
QIn case, your position is not accepted. What will you do?
?We will be bound by the collective decision of the Joint Opposition. But, I will make my personal choice if I am unable to abide by the collective decision.? ?
QWhat does it mean?
If the collective decision is to have a particular person as the candidate, I will either stay with the Joint Opposition or out of it.? ?
QDoes it mean you will join hands with the other side?
There is no joining hands with anybody in this regard. I cannot be in the Joint Opposition without abiding by the collective decision. I will remain outside the Joint Opposition in regards to that matter only.? ?
?
It is very urgent to bring about a change of government. We cannot endure any more the policies being carried out by the government. People cannot bear the high cost of living. People cannot stand and watch how the unitary state is under threat and Federalism is imposed
QOtherwise, is there any decision to join the United National Party (UNP) in such an eventuality?
(Laughs) I can only laugh at it.? ?
QWhy is it?
The UNP is anathema for us from our young days. The UNP means imperialism, right wing, discrimination, oppression and everything that is bad in this country. The UNP is the representation of globalization and neo-liberalism. I think that is sufficient justification to see the UNP as anathema.? ?
QHow do you look at the current status of politics in the country?
There is a serious turn of events prompting the change of political equation. The government is unable to stay together cohesively. There is no coherence within the government. There is conflict within the government. There is a serious competition between President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe representing two currents of thought. It has almost reached the point of breaking up. I expect the current political situation to develop into a split within the governing coalition.? ?
QHow soon will it happen in your view?
It is very difficult to give dates. It will happen fairly sooner. The major political events like the presidential election could begin earlier if the current President decided to contest. That is very near at hand. That is one political factor that is pushing.?
?
The UNP has decided not to go along with the concept of common candidate any more. It will have its own candidate. The UNP has voiced more than once their intention to form its own government. Economically and financially, the country?s situation is decisively crucial. The rupee value is declining.?
There is increasing debt. People?s income level is declining. The cost of living is skyrocketing. All these bring about conditions of upheaval. The government has to deliver or have a political change in order to make a new stand. All these facts put together, I think it is in the interests of the government to opt for a new political decision. What it could be is dependent on other factors. Political decisions have to be taken by the partners of the government sooner than later. The conditions are compelling. There is a serious breakdown in the government affairs. I reason out that there will be an imminent political change.? ?
QHow certain are you of such a change?
I am fairly certain going by my political experience and ability to gauge political trends. There will be a new turn of events.? ?
QWhat will be the new political formation in such an eventuality??
It will be the President who, in all likelihood, wants to break ranks with the unity government. The unity government does not favour him in terms of his popularity any longer. On the other hand, the unity government has an inbuilt problem about the leadership. Therefore, the President has to break up from the unity government. It means he has the opportunity of forming a new government. He calls upon a new person to be the Prime Minister and appoint the Cabinet accordingly.? ?
?
The UNP has decided not to go along with the concept of common candidate any more. It will have its own candidate
QWhat is your choice of the Prime Minister in case a new government is formed?
It is the choice of the President. The President will decide with whom he will coalesce. I think the President will try out the option of having Mahinda Rajapaksa and the Joint Opposition. For that, he has to agree to appoint Mr Rajapaksa as the Prime Minister. That is one option. In return, Mahinda and the Joint Opposition have to come to an arrangement with the President to make him reasonably comfortable in the aftermath.? ?
QHow optimistic are you of making Mr Rajapaksa the Prime Minister?
There is no other option.? ?
QIs it politically realistic because there was a lot of antagonism between the two in the past?
In politics, antagonism does not last. Only the alliances are renewed. Antagonism gives way to new alliances. The major premise is not antagonism, but the alliance.? ?
QHave you sought the possibility of patching up differences between the two?
I cannot answer you directly. I can only say that I have found out his mind (the President?s mind) to be favouring a possible agreement with Mahinda. I have read his mind.? ?
QBut, some people say nobody can read the President? mind accurately. How certain are you of your reading of his mind then?
I may be wrong. I cannot be certain that I am correct. But, one has to arrive at some conclusion in politics in making the next move. You cannot keep everything in uncertainty.? ?
QIf this arrangement is worked out, what will be the arrangement for the Presidential Elections??
If this arrangement works out, there will be no presidential election.? ?
?
I can only say that I have found out his mind (the President?s mind) to be favouring a possible agreement with Mahinda.?
I have read his mind
QWhat does it?mean?
It means that Mahinda as the Prime Minister will muster the support of two ?thirds with the concurrence of the President to amend the Constitution. That is to avoid a Presidential Election. That is to elect the President by an internal arrangement in Parliament.? ?
Q:Are you favouring such a move rather than conducting the Presidential Elections?
?We want to do away with the presidential system. We can take this opportunity for it.? ?
QIs your idea gaining ground in the Joint Opposition?
The leftist parties have always maintained this position in the Joint Opposition. We want a parliamentary system.? ?
QHow are you getting ready for the September?5th protest?
That is an important day. After we got a popular victory on February 10, 2018, it has had its political effects everywhere. It dawned on everyone that the Joint Opposition which contested under ?lotus bud symbol? is the major political force. Everybody was shockingly awakened to this reality. It had its repercussions within Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP). It resulted in a section of the SLFP breaking up from the government. It caused major trouble within the UNP. We have 70 members in Parliament now. We are the main opposition. But, we are not recognized. We are second only to the UNP in terms of the number of MPs. Where do we go from here?? ?
September 5 is an important day for us. It will be a major, unprecedented political action of mass intervention. People will gather in large numbers and fill the space in Colombo. It will bring the activities of Colombo to a halt. Of course, the city will become prepared for it in advance.? ?
It is very urgent to bring about a change of government. We cannot endure any more the policies being carried out by the government. People cannot bear the high cost of living. People cannot stand and watch how the unitary state is under threat and Federalism is imposed. Above, we have the question of our national assets being alienated. The Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with Singapore is a classic case in point.? ?
?
There is a serious breakdown in the government affairs. I reason out that there will be an imminent political change
?
QAre you for a unitary?state now?
I am for a Unitary State with provincial powers. It can be State run by the Provincial Councils but with unitary characters.

?I Will Follow, I Will Lead?: PrepITES Striking a new tune
	
The Choir of S. Thomas? Preparatory School
?
The Choir of S. Thomas? Preparatory School will present ?I Will Follow, I Will Lead? (IWFIWL) at the Auditorium of the Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority in Kollupitiya (Colombo 3) from September 7-9 starting at 7 p.m each day.
I confess, I know very little about music, the theory or the practice. I know even less about choirs and orchestras and for this reason am clueless when it comes to concerts, regardless of the organiser. I vaguely remember milling around the piano during the music period, learning or rather trying to learn the fundamentals, from ?Do Re Mi? to ?Under the Spreading Chestnut Tree?. A few years later, having been auditioned by our teacher (we were asked to recite the national anthem, of all things!), I was selected for the choir. I never went, though.? ?
I?ve always been fascinated by choirs. There?s something enchanting, after all, about a group of students or adults singing and complementing each other without missing a beat. It takes an exceptional teacher to spot out who?s out of tune and where exactly he has gone out of tune, and it takes an exceptional cast of altos, sopranos, tenors, and those other voices to deliver a perfect ensemble.? ?
All I know is that choirs have come a long way, with a history that goes back to Classical Antiquity all the way through the Renaissance, the Baroque Era, and the Romantic Eras, giving way to the 20th century.? ?
?I Will Follow, I Will Lead? is the third of three shows held to celebrate the 80th anniversary of S. Thomas? Preparatory School and the way I see it, it is also the biggest. The first was an orchestral concert (?Gandhara?) and the second a performance of ?Charlie and the Chocolate Factory?. ?IWFIWL?, on the other hand, will bring about a fusion of the contemporary and the traditional in a bid to shatter misconceptions related to the field. To this end, I went to the Sooriya Village two weeks ago, talked with the students, and took down notes. Here?s what I observed.? ?
First, a few details about the hosts. Founded on May 17, 1938 and considered the first preparatory school in Sri Lanka, S. Thomas? Preparatory houses 800 students. The Choir houses around 37 or so students (five basses, seven tenors, and seven sopranos, with the rest as altos) and have been limited for the most to Christmas Carols and the year end showcase concert. ?IWFIWL? therefore will be ?unprecedented?.? ?
?I spoke with the choir master at S. Thomas? Prep, Sanchitha Wickremesooriya, and tried to glean from his the how, what, and wherefore of the culture of music he and the school have more or less facilitated through the choir. I began by asking him as to how, in an era where choirs have moved out of the sacred, school choirs in general have evolved. ?Well to be frank, they have transited from the one to the other pretty quickly. Even in public secular schools, choirs existed for the sake of performing carols and other religious services. It?s very different now. Even at schools run on religious lines, choirs have unshackled themselves of religious constraints.?? ?
I interject here and suggest that the media may have played a role in this evolution, and Sanchitha, with some reservation, agrees. ?You can?t really ignore the media. It?s everywhere. Access to the internet has increased, and is now more widespread than ever before here. Once you open your eyes to this world, there?s no turning back. On the other hand, I won?t say the media is the only reason for this. There are and have been other more complex factors, considering the state of the world we are in and how the arts have been secularised.?? ?
Reflecting on these trends, ?IWFIWL? will, interestingly enough, feature contemporary artistes: Alien Accent, Sanuka Wickramasinghe, Ridma Weerawardena and Dilan Jayakody. Not that it?ll be limited to modern music alone of course: alongside Sanuka and Ridma, there will be a horde of professional veterans, including Christopher Prins (drums), Melissa Pereira (keyboard), and Shalintha Rodrigo (bass).?
Perhaps one of the most lamentable trends among young people is their (blissful) lack of awareness of ?traditional music?. We celebrate contemporary music and diss (for the lack of a better term) old songs.
?We savour the tunes of popular artistes and cast aside or deride the work of the old masters. In that sense, the choirmaster has done his part well with the choir at Prep; having taken over the choir two and a half years ago, he has, among other things, conducted workshops for the students with such renowned veterans as Kavichandran Alexander (the first Sri Lankan to record and produce several Grammy Award winning albums), and has instilled a firm, rigid, but at the same time casual culture of discipline among the choir performers.?
?Even if you have a superb voice and the group can?t do without you, if you are late or you don?t attend, you?re out. That?s the rule I?ve set down for these boys,? Sanchitha tells me.? ?
Eager to find out more, I talk with some of those boys. From Grade Six to Grade Nine, they represent, I think, a specific milieu, largely urbane and English speaking. They have the same tastes, they hold dear the same artistes, though some of them profess admiration for the old classical masters. No, this is not to suggest that it is this milieu which will come out at ?IWFIWL?. Far from it. But it is difficult to divide the music from the milieu, most of the time, which is why credit must be given to the team behind the show for having diversified the range of songs we will hear this Friday, Saturday, and Sunday.?
One boy in particular, Ayon (who was born in Mulleriyawa and is boarded at the school hostel), however, freely admits his preference for local ?old? music, especially the Gypsies.?
As for the rest, well most of them have their icons, ranging from Michael Jackson to Ed Sheeran and to lesser heard of bands and vocalists like Twenty One Pilots and Sam Smith.
?They also indulge in different activities, moreover, from cadetting to scouting to the orchestra. All in all, a veritable mishmash.? ?
If ?I Will Follow I Will Lead? (Sanchitha on the meaning of the title: ?We want to bring out the message that in a school choir, you must lead and you must also be led, so as to promote unity and harmony?) seems a tad limited to one institution, that is not the reality.?
On the contrary, the boys will be sharing the stage on all three days with different guest choirs: Ladies College on Friday, Bishops College on Saturday, and Visakha Vidyalaya on Sunday.?
This will be in addition to the choirs from the other S. Thomas? choirs, from Mount Lavinia, Bandarawela, and Gurutalawa. Given this, and given what I?ve outlined and sketched out above, there?s really nothing here that you can?t look forward to.?
As a final point then, I can only quote the verdict that the boys (including the choir leader, Sarinda Abeynaike) told me: ?It?s been great. So far.?? ?

Informatics Institute of Technology (IIT), the pioneer in British higher education in Sri Lanka,has launched Sri Lanka?s first-ever Cyber Security and Forensics Master?s programme from the University of Westminster, UK.
Students following the 2 year part time course will gain insights into the nature of the security threats faced by today?s computer systems, the type of information that is stored on digital devices and how digital evidences can be traced and extracted from them. The course offers students the chance to learn about a variety of tools available todaywhich include forensic tools. It will also look into the analysis of professional and ethical issues relating to computer security and forensics, and the development of related professional competencies, such as report writing and presenting evidence in a court of law.
The course is structured in a way where all students cover five core modulesand choose a specialisation in Cyber Security or Digital Forensics. The core modules include Cyber Security Evidence and Procedure, Fundamentals of Security Technology, Internet Security, Research Methods and Professional Practice.Cyber Security focuses on analysis and assessment of risk plus how to minimise it. Digital Forensics addresses how to extract and use digital information from a wide range of systems and devices to detect crimes.
Commenting on the newest addition to the institute?s portfolio, Naomi Krishnarajah ? Dean of IIT stated, ?In today?s high-tech world, computers play a vital role in all aspects of our daily lives. Numerous industries and institutions ? from hospitals, banks, power plants, telecommunication companies and many more ? rely heavily on them for virtually every aspect of their operations. Unfortunately, while the world is becoming increasingly inter-connected, there is not enough attention paid to the security aspects and therefore computer systems and the huge volumes of data onthem are vulnerableto attacks by malicious parties. Therefore, the need for improved computer security has never been greater and will only continue to increase into the future. Weare introducing this Master?s programmeto increase the number of skilled professionals in the country to cope with this fast-changing field of IT.

SARDAR DAM AFP, Sept3 2018 -? The world?s biggest statue is rising in a remote corner of India to honour an independence hero but it could quickly be outdone by a monument to a Hindu warrior king in the sea off Mumbai.? ?
In a burst of nationalist fervour, around one billion dollars is being spent on the two giant effigies, each more than twice as tall as the Statue of Liberty.? ?
A 182-metre-high tribute to independence icon Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel in Gujarat state will be the first to dwarf the Spring Temple Buddha in China, currently the world?s biggest statue at 128 metres in height.? ?
Pick-axes are also swinging for a 212-metre-high likeness of 17th-century king Chhatrapati Shivaji.? ?
An army of 2,500 workers, including several hundred Chinese labourers, are toiling on the figure of Patel so it can be ready for inauguration on October 31 by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.? ?
The 29.9-billion-rupee ($430-million) ?Statue of Unity? overlooking the isolated Sardar Sarovar Dam is a pet project of Modi.

?On its apparent southward relative motion the sun will be directly over the latitudes of Sri Lanka from August 28 to September 7 this year,? it said.
The Met Department said the sun was yesterday directly over Merawala, Kadigamuwa, Galgamuwa, Ridigama, Pussella, Kudavila and Pulukunuwa at 12.09 pm. It will be directly over Andiambalama, Narangoda, Gevilipitiya, Karawetiya, Radeliyagoda and Nilgala.

Jayantha stresses on importance of being hospitable
	
Jayanatha De Silva being welcomed at the opening ceremony of the Digitalization Library of the National Youth Services Council Training Institute at Borella
?
?
Ours is a country that conducts diploma courses to educate children on hospitality. ?We are not conscious of where are we heading for,? said Jayanatha De Silva, a Member of the Western Provincial Council.? ?
De Silva said that it is a matter of serious concern that traditional social values that led the nation along the right path through several millenniums have faded into oblivion and that the things happening in the country are ominous of a bleak future.? ?
He made these comments while addressing a large gathering of young men and women at the opening ceremony of the Digitalization Library of the National Youth Services Council Training Institute at Borella Ruhunu Kala Mawatha. He added that it is sad to note that Sri Lanka is a country that holds diploma courses to teach hospitality when this nation, during the past two millennia, held the reputation for being a hospitable nation.? ?
?Our ancestors took a keen interest on social values, social etiquette, customs and discipline regarding children. When we were at a meal, they paid particular attention to our manners. They would not allow us to sit on a higher or equal seat with them. Chewing betel was a taboo for us. However it is sad that this long history of social etiquette and discipline has been sent into oblivion. Our parents never allowed falsehood or stealing. They encouraged in giving and helping others in need. Our kings built temples, tanks and reservoirs for the future generations. King Dutugemunu did not live to see the completion of the construction work of Ruwanweliseya Cheithiya, but he paid homage to it after the framework of the Cheithiya was covered with a white cloth to show how it would look like when completed. King Parakramabahu the Great built many a tank and reservoir including Parakrama Samudraya which is an unparallel gigantic irrigation work in the country. This legacy handed down to the present generation by our ancestors is the great pride of the nation. It is the duty of the present generation to follow suit and at least to plant a tree for the welfare of the future generation or else they would die as sinners. Many individuals, motivated by personal gain, resort to stealing the nation?s properties. One must think about the well-being of one?s fellow men, just as one does with his own family. However much food we have, we can enjoy only three meals a day, and if we have money, we can have any number of vehicles, but we can travel only in one of them at any given time. The people, who amass wealth and means, as if they are immortals, often fail in their duty towards the country. Thousands of temples and remote villages are facing hardship for the want of basic facilities. As we know, there are villages without access roads, bridges, and even drinking water. One must use a part of one?s affluence to help them. Our ancestors followed the ?give and take policy?. They never failed in their duty to help their fellowmen.??
The Provincial Council Member affirmed.? ?
He expressed concern about the private sector institutions that employ workers for poor wages and stressed that it was not possible to develop the country if the wrongs were not corrected. He was of opinion that the National Youth Services Council should be stronger and lead young men and women along the right path.? ? ?

JO protest is a sacrifice for Namal?s court cases: Mangala
	
Tomorrow's protest is a sacrifice being offered by the Joint Opposition (JO) to get MP Namal Rajapaksa freed from court cases against him, Finance Minister Mangala Samaraweera said.
Speaking to the media at the Ministry he said MP Namal will be offering a large human sacrifice against his court cases with the help of his father?s supporters.
Minister Samaraweera said MP Namal Rajapaksa was a person who is out on bail in connection with several court cases.
?We are not going to do anything to the protesters as what had happened during the previous regime. It is after such a situation that the ?Yahapalanaya? Government came to power, our country has the seven-star democracy in the world. We have given the right to protest for any person in the country, even persons like Namal Rajapaksa who is out on bail,? he said.
No one had the freedom to hold a protest during the last ten years. As the Minister, I would appear on behalf of rights of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa and MP Namal Rajapaksa to engage in protests today. But, if anything happens in the day-to-day life of the people, we would not hesitate to take actions against the protesters.
Our government did not cancel any grounds for bookings of the JO members and while holding a protest march MP Namal Rajapaksa?s ambition was to give maximum pressure for the people, the Minister said.
However, MP Rajapaksa had stated that the protest march was organized in a way that no harm would be caused either to the general public or to public property. (Chaturanga Samarawickrama)

Addressing a press briefing Minister Madduma Bandara said that despite the Government having no intention to attack or obstruct any peaceful protests they have received information on possible attempts to create a chaotic situation in Colombo tomorrow.
Minister also said during the past three years no hurdles were placed on any joint opposition rally and the Government was not scared of tomorrow?s rally either.
Meanwhile Traffic DIG Ajith Rohana said that the Law enforcement authorities respect right to peaceful protests granted by the Constitution but will use the powers allowed by the Police ordinance and penal code to control any tense situation if occurred during the protest.
He requested those concerned to conduct the protest peacefully to avoid any inconvenience to the public. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

JO trying to use people as scapegoats: UNP
	
The joint opposition is planning to sacrifice the lives of innocent people to satisfy its political agenda, the United National Party (UNP) said today.
UNP spokesman and minister Harin Fernando told a media briefing that the JO was planning to create a commotion tomorrow.
?The plan is to create a clash and blame the government for any loss of life. The JO should take the full responsibility if someone is killed or public property is destroyed,? he said.
?The JO is also planning to give a wrong picture to the world that they are being attacked and prevented from holding peaceful protests. Therefore we will tell the police not to interrupt them.?
The minister said the real objective of the protest is to pump up MP Namal Rajapaka as the leader of JO instead of allowing others such as former defence secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa or any others to emerge as leaders.
?The ultimate objective is to show that Namal Rajapaksa is more powerful than the others in the JO,? he said.
The minister denied the JO claim that the main objective of the protest today is to oppose the Singapore-Sri Lanka Free Trade Agreement.
?There is nothing to protest against the FTA as it is very much similar to the FTA signed with Pakistan when former president Mahinda Rajapaksa was the prime minister in 2005,? he said. (Yohan Perera and Ajith Siriwardana)

'Lankan arrested in Sydney: Min.Musthapha baffled by false media accusations'
	
Minister Faiszer Musthapha had been perplexed following the false media allegations of connection to a youth who was arrested in Sydney over a document that the Australian Police allege contained plans for terrorist attacks, Deputy Minister H. M. M. Harees said today.
Deputy Minister Harees said that he spoke to Minister Musthapha after several foreign reports highlighted the Minister?s relationship to the accused.
?The Minister was deeply shocked of the accusation as he was not a pro terrorist person,? Harees said.
?The accused was not directly related to the Minister but a relative of his wife. Faiszer is a character that strongly concern for the country more than the Muslims. I?m disappointed about these reports. Just because the student is accused of a crime, it doesn?t mean he is guilty. Just because a person is related to the Minister it doesn?t mean the Minister too is involved,? he said.
He said that the incident had tarnished the country?s image and could impact the bilateral relations between the two countries.
The Deputy Minister urged that the Foreign Affair Ministry should interfere to the matter as the accused was a PhD student with a sound background and according to his family he was framed to the incident.
?I humbly request all local and foreign media to not to accuse the Minister based on false information. I can assure that Minister Musthapha is a gentlemen and a patriot,? Deputy Minister Harees added.???
25-year-old Kamar Nizamdeen, who was employed by a Sydney University has been charged over a document that Australian Police allege, contained plans for terrorist attacks. The 25-year-old was arrested by counter-terrorism officers at the University of NSW in Kensington on August 31.
However, Friends and family of the accused claimed that Nizamdeen was framed. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

Massive fire tears through Rio?s 200-year old National Museum
	
?
A massive fire raced through Brazil?s 200-year-old National Museum in Rio de Janeiro on Sunday, probably destroying its collection of more than 20 million items, ranging from archaeological finds to historical memorabilia.??
The destruction of the building, once a palace for emperors that had fallen into disrepair, was an ?incalculable loss for Brazil,? President Michel Temer said in a statement.??
?Two hundred years of work, research and knowledge were lost.? There was no word of the possible cause late on Sunday, nor if there were casualties or the exact extent of damage.??
Firefighters in Rio did not reply to requests for comment.??
Live television broadcast images of the fire, which began after the end of visiting hours at 5 p.m., burning out of control throughout the building late into the night.??
The museum, which is tied to the Rio de Janeiro federal university and the education ministry, was founded in 1818. It houses several landmark collections, including Egyptian artifacts and the oldest human fossil found in Brazil.??
The museum had suffered from years of neglect under numerous governments, the institution?s vice-director the Globo TV network on Sunday night.??
?We never got anything from the federal government,? said the official, Luiz Duarte. ?We recently finalized an agreement with (state-run development bank) BNDES for a massive investment, so that we could finally restore the palace and, ironically, we had planned on a new fire prevention system.? In a statement posted on its website in June, BNDES agreed to financing of 21.7 million reais ($5.35 million) to ?physically restore the historic building? and also to carry out work to ?guarantee more security to its collections.??

Mauri decides to break her silence
	
With all her past protests producing no breakthrough a mother of two??takes to the streets today to locate her husband abducted 5 years ago?
To find out the fate of her husband and seek justice
	Expedite the trial and conduct it impartially
	A school for her children and to ensure a future for them
	She is a diabetes patient
	Two years back she staged a silent protest before the Presidential Secretariat
?
?Mauri Inoka?s husband was abducted five years ago, in 2013. At the time she was pregnant with twins. Since then she has toiled day and night to bring up her children despite the backlash against her on social media and other platforms.?
Her husband, Madushka Haris de Silva, a fruit seller, was abducted along with his two friends on September 02, 2013.? His friends were released. However, Mauri claims that to date no statement has been obtained from them, though there is a case pending before the Anuradhapura Court which was filed based on the complaint she had made to the police. ?There are two eyewitnesses and we have details of the number plate which was on the vehicle used to abduct him,? she told Daily mirror .?
Her primary concern is to find out the fate of her husband and seek justice. ?He was abducted for political reasons. But my husband has not committed any wrong to deserves this kind of treatment. You can?t just penalise a person without proving the offense. They say he took ransom. I want them to prove it,? she said.?
Meanwhile, she also raised concerns about her five-year-old twins who haven?t received any assistance from the Government. ?I want a school for my children. Though I sent applications to many schools, I have not received responses,? she said. Mauri wishes to educate her children and expressed hopes of receiving the help of a benefactor who would support them. ?I don?t want a cent for myself, but I want my children to be educated and have a future,? she said.?
She is a diabetes patient and is suffering from weak nerves owing to stress. She used to work as an attendant in a hospital. However, the inability to leave her children behind at home has now prevented her from going to the hospital. At the moment she makes flower pots for a living.?
Silent protests?
During the past five years Mauri has been silently protesting in various places; for instance before the Presidential Secretariat in 2016. ?But the OIC filed a case against me and the others present for using my children cruelly as tools for the protest,? she said. She pointed out that the children were kept in the shade and were given drawing books to draw on.?
She added that though she was asked to come to the police, owing to harassment by the police, which she has previously experienced, she did not go. ?There is no point in questioning me constantly. There are two people who were with my husband. There are eyewitnesses. Their testimonies should be collected!
?Why is this case being ignored despite there being so much information?? she quizzed.?
?
But the OIC filed a case against me and the others present for using my children cruelly as tools for the protest
Two years back she staged a silent protest before the Presidential Secretariat with the hope of meeting the President as part of her fight for justice. With no answers to the questions that were posed in the placards that were held at the protest- ?Where is Madushka? What happened to him?- and despite the false promises and the intimidation, she is still determined to stage a silent vigil. Mauri Inoka will be staging a protest alongside activists at the Galle Face Green on September 4 (today) from 8am onwards and it will go on throughout the night.?
??This time I don?t want false promises. I don?t want to be fooled again,? she affirmed.?

An old couple were leading a quiet comfortable life in peace in a rambling house on a 129 perch- plot at a street in a bustling area in the city when they were compelled to take in a boarder. The couple had several domestic aides to attend on them hand and foot.
However, the quiet life the couple was leading in their sunset years was rudely disrupted when more ?boarders? one by one began forcibly occupying the house. And the worst was to come when their servants disappeared and the ?boarders? took charge of the entire house forcing the couple into the annexe.
It had come to light later that the goons, who had taken over the house displacing the old couple had been sent by the son-in-law of a powerful political authority, as part of a devious plan to acquire the property by illegal means.
The couple has now retained a senior counsel in a bid to evict the intruders.??
The politico, the property grabber?s father- in- law, is a purohita in the yahapalanaya, who once stood out as a prominent advocate of national reconciliation, they say.

Peace Building and Capacity
	
?
There is no doubt that the government has the greater responsibility to ensure that the requisite legal frameworks, policy implementation mechanisms for peace to be sustainable and for reconciliation to be meaningful. In present context of increasing direct internal regulation, it appears that when the international community calls for greater transparency and accountability for present government (good governance), what is meant is greater accountability to the international community rather than to citizens in the country; the policy-making process may have been opened up to review by human rights commission and some individual countries such as the Britain, USA, Canada and the EU etc. also, it is clear that administrative capacity-building under UNHRC auspices, which focus on policy outcome through internal and externally managing the policy process, has the unintended outcome of undermining institutional capacities. In fact, takes the policy process further away from elected representatives and their constituents.??
It is clear that administrative capacity-building talks are being held under the auspices of the UN Human Rights Commission (according to them there are some contradiction issues with the both governments, past regime and present), which focuses on policy outcomes and peace building slow progress through internal institutions managing the policy process, has shown since war end 2009.? ?
?
For example, the human rights and minority representation; should be drawn up a comprehensive programme for the promotion of multi-ethnic coexistence and for the protection of minority groups in the country
The government is a central part of assistance to make peace building, whose expertise (local) and assistant would have bought in drawing up and overseeing administrative procedures through the long-term mission and training with the support of the international community; developing and implementation of policies being dependent upon state-based democratic processes. For example, the human rights and minority representation; should be drawn up a comprehensive programme for the promotion of multi-ethnic coexistence and for the protection of minority groups in the country. In areas of minority rights, the internal drawing up and imposition of policy can increase fears and concerns. However, the stability pacts assume that the internal establishment of campaigns among the Sinhala majority and around minorities are questions, to get beneficial we need to establish trustworthy human rights protection centres and urges that legislation reviews and awareness campaigns and promotion of the population are important activities.??
The stability pact has gone slow direction through, it?s good governance programme by dint of the unstable political situation (the country heading to three directions of the political campaign for the power struggle without concerning the country?s major issues) in the country and they have forgotten focusing on the development of local and provincial governments and the establishment of institutions and the reform of public administration. This may result in policy-making that runs the risk of failing to recognize local problems or to adapt to local circumstances. Example provincial council administration issues and more serious risk is that the fragmentation of the domestic political process (what we are experiencing today). If regional and local assemblies or ethnic and national minority groups are to encourage seeking external support; this may cause friction or lead to a breakdown relationship with central government institutions.??
?
In areas of minority rights, the internal drawing up and imposition of policy can increase fears and concerns
Civil Society??
Having considered peace process progresses slowly in the country, the civil society, particularly we need an independent media and NGOs support (trustworthy) vital to the good governance process (but unfortunately we are unable to see much of it today) ?there is also a need for a more active civil society, requiring not only greater openness and accountability on the part of the government but also access to funding to empower the general population, media and non-governmental organization to generate this activity? (EC, 2001a:10). What we can see today, this artificial and dishonest drive to empower civil society in Sri Lanka, results in a highly bureaucratized process of all activities. Civil society is to be turned to in the attempt to substantiate the argument that external and internal regulation is led by the demand of those with the correct understanding of the ?genuine? needs and interests of their society, if this work as an artificial and dishonest drive to empower civil society that would be resulted in a highly bureaucratized process and policy initiative would be jeopardized and isolated from the civil society themselves.??
In addition to that political motivates groups and individuals support to civil society are in many ways, such as media discussion, star class hotel conferences and political stage etc., are inadequate and it covers a very minor elite group within the population; Consequently, these groups are professionalized, it separates itself from the grassroots problems and social reality. We can see hundreds of round tables and workshops are produced and attended by the same group of people in the civil society.? ?

In the peace building policy process can have unintended results of marginalizing public participation further by isolating policy-making from broader constituency and legitimizing policy made by international influence with only limited elite group consultation, this would be helped ?where the public consensus collapses, a political opportunity goes to create for anti-reform parties, including intolerant nationalists in all ethnic groups to challenge to the peace building program. In such a situation, we all have an equal responsibility in peace building and we have the potential for self-initiative, for making something than waiting for things to happen, and for resistance, perhaps not on a grand scale, but certainly at the level of the individual and the personal, when it comes to lasting peace building and reconciliation process in the country.? ?

Proposal to set up Police and Crimes University before Cabinet soon: PM
	
A paper is to be submitted to the Cabinet soon to set up a Police and Crimes University, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said yesterday.
The Prime Minister revealed this at the 152nd police day celebrations held at the Field Force Head Quarters grounds in Bambalapitiya last evening.
?It is essential to tackle drug trafficking. An Emergency response team has been established for this purpose. We hope to present to cabinet a paper to set up a police and Crimes University shortly. IGP has told me that this information is not reported in the media. I have to tell him that police and the politicians are ones who are criticized heavily in this country. Police are not praised no matter how hard they work,? the Prime Minister said.
The Prime Minister said police should make a review on how it had worked and find out what its shortcomings are. ?Without just satisfying itself with what it had done during this year, the police should re-look at what it had gained and where it had gone wrong. One achievement of the police this year is the last local government election which was peaceful. Police did a good job providing security to counting centres and polling booths. A shortcoming where the police are concerned is the incident in Digana. Police should learn from its mistakes committed in Digana. It was possible how violence and crimes were triggered through social media. Therefore the police should focus more on technology,? he added.
?The IGP should work with the Minister and Deputy Minister of law and order who are working towards developing the police further. We have increased the salaries of police officers. I have instructed by the secretary to call the senior police officers and members of police commission and have a dialogue with them to resolve issues pertaining to police. British government started a police to maintain law and order. A service named police was formed by the British government for the first time in the world to maintain law and order. There is a police force in many countries. Some countries do not have an army but there is a police service. Army and other forces were given the task of maintaining law and order during wartime but now that responsibility totally lies with the police. The main task of the police is to uphold rule of law. There are semi-forces in some countries, STF acts as a semi-force in Sri Lanka. STF could be proud as it is the first semi-force created in Asia. Police and the STF have been entrusted with the task of maintaining law and order. The country is not stable when there is no law and order. It is not possible to develop a nation which is not stable,? he also said.
IGP Pujith Jayasundara said the police have already embarked on establishing an emergency response team. He said infrastructure needed for it has been put in place while recruitment and training is also underway. (Yohan Perera)

SL envoy didn't boycott Maldives bridge opening: MFA
	
The Sri Lankan Ambassador to Maldives did not boycott the opening ceremony of the China-Maldives friendship bridge in Maldives but turned back as his vehicle was not allowed to proceed to the venue, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) said yesterday.
Ministry Spokesperson Mahishini Colonne said the ambassador had not boycotted the event as he went there in order to participate in the event.?However, their vehicles were not allowed to proceed so they were forced to turn back,? she informed Daily Mirror.
Media reports said that the Ambassadors of Sri Lanka and Bangladesh in the Maldives had boycotted the bridge opening ceremony, an event that was also not attended by the Indian Envoy.
Member of the Maldives Parliament and Joint Opposition Spokesperson Ahmed Mahloof said the Ambassadors of Sri Lanka and Bangladesh boycotted the bridge inauguration event as their cars were stopped by President Abdulla Yameen?s security and they were asked to walk.
?Only the Chinese Ambassador?s car was allowed to proceed to the venue. Such an insult to traditional friends,? he tweeted.
The two-kilometre long bridge which connects Male and Hulhule Island, was built using funds mainly received from China. The opening was held on August 30. (Lahiru Pothmulla)
