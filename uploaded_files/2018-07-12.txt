Adopting plain packaging a must to curtail smoking
	
?
Plain packaging for cigarettes just makes sense
	?
	Australia in 2012, but now 9 countries are implementing the policy
	?
	They will even argue that plain packaging will increase smoking because the illicit tobacco market will increase
?
?
Curtailing the ability of cigarette packs to advertise and promote their brands just makes common sense. Why? Think about it - everybody these days would agree that the ban on advertising tobacco on television and the internet, on billboards and in shops, is sensible and necessary. Nobody could dispute that promoting tobacco and smoking have led to the greatest public health threat the world has ever known. And every marketing manager of any business that makes consumer goods will tell you how important packaging is to attract people into buying their products. Attractive packaging is advertising and for cigarette companies it is the only advertising they are left with.? ?
Even though the tobacco companies try to deny it in public, they have known this for years. Disclosed internal industry documents show a Philip Morris executive as saying ?In the absence of any other marketing messages, our packaging . . . is the sole communicator of our brand essence. Put in another way ? when you don?t have anything else ? our packaging is our marketing.?
The advertising power of packaging is even more important for cigarettes than it is for things like washing powder or noodles. This is because cigarettes are a ?badge? product that gets taken out and displayed every time a smoker takes out a cigarette or leaves the pack on a caf? table. These regular everyday actions expose other people, including kids, to the imagery and branding of tobacco. Branding that is intended to attract the eye away from the health warnings and make positive associations with smoking instead. Plain packaging removes all the promotional features and replaces them with a dull single colour, while leaving the important health warnings in place.? ?
?
Taking a strong stand?
So plain packaging for cigarettes just makes sense and the Government of Sri Lanka clearly sees the rationale for doing this. In April the Cabinet approved a proposal submitted by the Minister of Health, Dr Rajitha Senaratne, to introduce plain packaging for tobacco. The Minister is to be congratulated for taking a strong stand against the tobacco industry and now the Government shouldn?t delay bringing forward the law and must lead the way by making Sri Lanka the first country in Asia to adopt this policy.? ?
Plain packaging started in Australia in 2012, but now 9 countries are implementing the policy, including France, the UK, Ireland and Norway, with many other countries in the process of adopting the laws. In Australia, and now with early statistics from France, the impacts have been clear ? falling smoking rates especially among young people.? ?
A study commissioned by the Australian Government showed that 108,228 less people were smoking as a direct result of plain packaging in the 34 months following implementation there. Youth smoking among 18-24 year olds has dropped from 15.7% in 2010 to 11.6% in 2016.? ?
In France, in the year after plain packaging was implemented, the smoking rate for 18-24 year old men dropped from 44.2% in 2016 to 35.3% in 2017.? ?
?
Baseless arguments?
When Sri Lanka goes ahead, the tobacco companies, and the organisations they use as fronts to make the arguments for them, will shout and scream that plain packaging is unlawful, unconstitutional and steals their intellectual property. They will even argue that plain packaging will increase smoking because the illicit tobacco market will increase. Just the same as they have argued in every other country. All their arguments are baseless and flawed, but don?t take my word for it ? courts around the world, in Australia, France, the UK and Norway, have rejected every legal challenge the tobacco companies have made against plain packaging laws.? ?
In fact, when the tobacco companies brought a legal challenge against the plain packaging regulations in the UK Courts, they argued that the law was unjustified because it would lead an increase in illicit and counterfeit tobacco but the companies produced no evidence to support their argument and made it by ?mere assertion?.In Australia, official figures show the rates of illicit tobacco usehave remained constant or dropped since 2012. Tobacco packaging rules have no impact on smuggling or illegal tobacco, instead it?s effective borders and strong policing that are the only measures that have a real effect.? ?
Plain packaging is not a silver bullet that on its own will get rid of the scourge of tobacco, but it is a straight forward, common sense, cost free public health policy - one that every country should have in its arsenal and the faster Sri Lanka takes it forward, the better for every citizen.?

AIA?s ?Healthiest Workplace Survey?, in Sri Lanka for the very first time!
	
AIA Insurance announced the launch of Sri Lanka?s Healthiest Workplace Survey (HWS) at the Great Place to Work conference yesterday. The Healthiest Workplace Survey is a comprehensive survey of the health and wellbeing of employees around Asia-Pacific. Having surveyed thousands of employees across multiple industries since its inception in 2017, this survey is being conducted by RAND Europe, a leading researcher in the field of health and wellness.?
Companies that participate can get a clear understanding of the health and wellbeing profiles of employees in terms of lifestyle, clinical indicators, mental health, stress, and other areas of concern. Companies can further gauge how well their wellness and health programmes are being utilised and how effective they are in improving employees? health.?
Companies can then use the results of the survey to identify effective interventions so that they can improve or initiate health promotion strategies to create a healthier work environment for their people. Over time these interventions will help boost the organisation's business performance by increasing productivity and reducing absenteeism. Taking part in the survey is free.?
Research and analysis for HWS is conducted by RAND Europe with support from local academic partners, which provide academic advisory services and validate the survey questionnaire and findings. Research will focus on understanding productivity loss and how workplace wellness strategies can be applied to reduce this loss.
AIA Chief Marketing Office Nikhil Advani noted, ?Given that so much of our time is spent at work, it?s important that we understand, measure and ultimately, improve wellbeing in the workplace. This survey gives employers an understanding of employees? health and wellbeing, giving them useful strategies to support them in their healthy living goals and improving company-wide productivity. If you calculate the productivity per employer that is lost to absenteeism and presenteeism every year in Asia, there is a clear message that identifying and addressing risks to employee health is critical to business performance. We aim to equip companies in Sri Lanka with the best insights and strategies to help improve business productivity while also improving wellbeing in the workplace.?
Sri Lankan companies with over 50 employees can participate, for free, in the programme, to be recognized under 3 key categories; Healthiest Workplace, Healthiest Employer and Healthiest Employee. You can register your company on the AIA website < www.aialife.com> under the ?AIA Vitality? tab, on or before the 20th July.?

Croatia beat England to reach World cup final
	
England's bid to reach a first World Cup final since 1966 came to an end in the last four as they lost in extra time to Croatia in Moscow.
Juventus striker Mario Mandzukic scored the winning goal in the 109th minute, slotting in from Ivan Perisic's flick-on into the area.
Perisic's volley sent the match into extra time after Kieran Trippier had given England a fifth-minute lead with a sublime free-kick.
Unfancied before the competition, Gareth Southgate's young side defied expectations by reaching the semi-finals but were undone by an experienced Croatia side.
England, playing in their first World Cup semi-final since 1990, got the perfect start through Trippier's brilliant free-kick and Croatia was finding it extremely difficult to deal with England's high-tempo game.
'Pinpoint' Trippier free-kick gives England early lead
Harry Kane could have doubled the lead but was denied by goalkeeper Danijel Subasic and Jesse Lingard placed a shot wide from a good position.
Croatia grew into the game in the second half and equalised through Perisic, and the Inter Milan winger hit the post with a low drive shortly after.
In extra time John Stones saw a header cleared off the line, while Pickford made a brilliant save from Mandzukic's close-range effort - but the Everton man could do nothing about the winner.
England will now play Belgium in Saturday's third/fourth place play-off in St Petersburg. (The Star)

Domestic fuel prices will depend on global trend: Rajitha
	
The government would decide on fuel prices in the domestic market on the 10th of every month after taking into account the fluctuation of fuel prices in the global market, Cabinet Spokesman, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
However, private bus operators will not be permitted to increase bus fares accordingly because a hike in bus fares took place recently which was for a period of two years, he said while addressing the weekly Cabinet news briefing yesterday.
?If private bus operators and other traders want to increase their prices following the increase in fuel prices they also need to align the cost of their goods and services to the pricing formula the government came up with for fuel which requires them to reduce prices when fuel prices come down and vice versa,? Minister Senaratne pointed out.
A review committee would be set up at the Finance Ministry comprising representatives from the Finance Ministry, Petroleum Ministry, Presidential Secretariat and Cost of Living Committee with the task of reviewing global oil prices on the 10th of each month and fixing the fuel prices accordingly.
This mechanism will help to minimize losses at the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CEYPETCO) and lessen the burden on the Treasury. However, the Treasury will continue to absorb any extra liability in an event of an unexpected sharp increase in global oil prices, Minister Senaratne stressed.
?It should be stated that CEYPETCO still sells a litre of kerosene at a loss of Rs.14. However, global fuel prices have been steady in the past few weeks and I expect a further reduction in fuel prices in the global market in the days to come.
If there is a significant reduction in the price of fuel in the international market, the government would definitely pass the benefit of that to consumers,? Minister Senaratne stressed. (Sandun A. Jayasekera)

Edu. Ministry had violated the Constitution in appointing teachers: PM
	
The Ministry of Education has been violating the Constitution in appointing teachers for the past 30 years, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said today.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe came out with this statement at the launch of Subaga Scholarship scheme for school children at Temple Trees last morning.
?A clause was included in the 13th Amendment to the Constitution that only teachers who hold a degree or a diploma should be appointed to schools run by the central government and provincial councils. However it was changed later temporarily allowing those in other fields to be appointed as teachers. This change was effective only for a certain period. However this procedure has been continuing for the last 30 years violating the Constitution,? the Prime Minister said.
He said the government has decided to only appoint those possessing relevant degrees and diplomas as teachers.
The Prime Minister said Finland had agreed to assist Sri Lanka in changing its education policy. ?We have decided to include vocational training subjects in the school curriculum and Finland will support us in this endeavour,? he said while stating that the USA would provide training to English teachers.
The Prime Minister added that the intention of the government was to allow children who excel in sports and other fields such as performing arts to pursue a career in those areas. (Yohan Perera)

## Title: Fuel price hike President kept in the dark by treasury officials

Fuel price hike President kept in the dark by treasury officials
	
?
They agreed on one thing and did another. I also came to know through the media the following day
	I know Finance Minister Mangala Samaraweera will be opposed to this idea. Yet, we have to implement it
?
President Maithripala Sirisena was outraged at Tuesday?s Cabinet meeting for keeping him in the dark about the move for the upward revision of fuel prices last week. First, the decision was taken at a meeting attended by the President last Thursday to revise the prices in conformity with the pricing formula adopted for the purpose. Accordingly, the prices were to be increased effective from last Friday. Within a few hours of the price hike coming into effect, it was rescinded after the intervention by the President.? ?
The President divulged the reason for his action at Tuesday?s cabinet meeting.? ?
A visibly incensed President Sirisena reprimanded the Finance Ministry officials at the Cabinet meeting. He said the Treasury officials agreed to raise prices by six or seven rupees, but, in contract, they had done so by eight and nine rupees.? ?
?They agreed on one thing and did another. I also came to know through the media the following day,? the President said.? ?
?
As an initial step, the President suggested the execution of death row criminals found to be operating drug cartels from behind bars with the covert or overt support of the prison authorities
?
After Tuesday?s meeting, the President, however, met with all the stakeholders and endorsed the proposed price hikes that came into effect finally yesterday, despite initial anger.? ?
This is yet another incident that bespeaks the absence of coherent and cohesive approach in solving problems by the government. Most of the time, the President is unaware of what is transpiring. So, he deposes what the Ministers propose on some occasions. The entire government is demeaned in the public eye as a result.?
?
Capital punishment, an uphill task for Govt
In addition, at the same Cabinet meeting, the President drew his attention to the rising crime wave in the country, particularly the incidents of drug trafficking. The President appeared to have realized that the current forms of punishment for such offences were not deterrent enough. Therefore, he proposed to re-introduce the execution of those sentenced to death. Capital punishment is a legal penalty in Sri Lanka. However, there have been no executions since June 23, 1976, although death sentences were handed down continuously by the High and Supreme Courts for murder and drug trafficking convictions. In fact, these sentences are automatically commuted to life in prison. In certain instances, the death sentences on some criminals were commuted to life through lawful means based on recommendations by a committee appointed to look into it in 2014.? ?
According to the Department of Prisons, there are over 1000 prisoners on the death row at the moment in Sri Lanka.? ?
The President, making his remarks to the Cabinet, said at least those convicted to death for drug related offences, should be punished by death. ?I know Finance Minister Mangala Samaraweera will be opposed to this idea. Yet, we have to implement it,? he said.??
For an execution of any convicted criminal to be carried out, the President has to sanction it in keeping with the legal provisions stipulated in this regard. Be that as it may, successive Presidents declined to do it, virtually putting an end to capital punishment in the country.? ?
The President himself proposed the idea this time to execute those sentenced to death, departing from the attitudes of his predecessors. The Cabinet Ministers also endorsed the views expressed by the President. As an initial step, the President suggested the execution of death row criminals found to be operating drug cartels from behind bars with the covert or overt support of the prison authorities.? ?
In essence, there is no barrier for the implementation of the capital punishment if the President is ready to sanction it. Now, the President has made his stance known to the country. Most Cabinet Ministers also agreed with him. Then, it is just a matter for the President to walk the talk if he really means what he said.? ?
Let alone, there is a strong lobby in the western world against the death sentence being implemented anywhere in the world. The countries that persist with death penalty have come under severe criticism from those lobbying groups at the international forums such as the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC).? ?
Influential personalities of this government also view human rights from a western point of view. As such, the President?s move is bound to encounter hurdles from within his own government. Already, Sri Lanka is in the international spotlight due to the UNHRC resolution adopted in 2015 calling for probes into the alleged rights violations during the war time. Against this backdrop, it will be an uphill task to re-introduce capital punishment though the President wants it. However, if the President is strong-willed, this will not be a difficult task, though.? ?
?
Wijithamuni to join UNP?
?
The mainstream political forces are now active in view of the Presidential Election scheduled to be conducted at the end of next year. Though the elections are yet to be declared, the political atmosphere is suffused with rhetoric associated with the elections. Wide perception built around the possible candidacy of former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa is the starting point of this political debate.? ?
The Joint Opposition that supports him carried out propaganda work by conducting seminars and other meetings. Alongside, the UNP, as the ruling party, has already started its political criticism directed at Gotabhaya. So, the country is in an election mood once again.? ?
?
New political alignments are also likely. Some of the SLFP MPs serving in the govt are slated to join the UNP ahead of any national elections
?
Ahead of the elections, new political alignments are also likely. Some of the SLFP MPs serving in the government are slated to join the UNP ahead of any national election, according to political sources. That Fisheries Minister Gamini Wijith Wijeyamuni Zoysa spoke supportive of UNP leader Ranil Wickremesinghe at a recent event in Bibile, Monaragala is a clear indication of his readiness to switch political allegiance to him during election times.? ?
?We are the ones who protected the Prime Minister when there was the no confidence motion against him,? he said.?
?
Vasu questions absence of SLFP MPs?
The leaders of the Joint Opposition met with former President Mahinda Rajapaksa in the chair. However, anyone from the 16-member group of the SLFP had not been invited. Democratic Left Front leader MP Vasudeva Nanayakkara questioned it. The former President said he would invite them to attend the future meetings.

Govt. burdening people while reducing fines on fraudsters: JVP
	
The Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) charged today that the government had burdened the people by imposing excessive taxes and fines such as new traffic fines while reducing the fines imposed on fraudsters through the National Audit Bill.
JVP MP Sunil Hadunnetti told a news conference that the government had imposed new fines and had increased fines on traffic offences so as to increase government revenue.
?The traffic rules have been strengthened not to discipline the motorists but to increase government revenue. The government is trying to sustain at the cost of the people. It has reduced the fines imposed on fraudsters engaged in massive frauds and corruption through the national audit bill while taxing and fining common people,? he said.
He said even though the government was taxing and fining the people excessively, it was providing more privileges and benefits to MPs and ministers.
?The government is planning to provide more benefits and vehicles to newly appointed monitoring MPs. The numbers of ministers are ever increasing,? he charged. (Ajith Siriwardana)

Govt. fleecing public through fuel price manipulation: MR
	
Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa said today the government had fleeced the public through the manipulation of fuel prices and urged it to explain to the public why the retail price of fuel was disproportionately high today.
?The latest price increase is being justified in terms of a price formula which nobody has seen. It is quite clear that this government is aiming to collect more tax revenue from fuel by increasing and reducing fuel prices frequently so that at the end of the year, more revenue would have been collected from consumers,? he said in a statement.
?This kind of price manipulation is a standard practice in the large scale retail industry. The public should also take note of the devious manner in which the government implemented the fuel price increase. The Indian Oil Company was first allowed to increase their prices while the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation held back. After a few days when the people had reconciled themselves to a fuel price increase, the government increased the prices at the CPC stations as well. They sought to diffuse public outrage by such means. Such practices are all part of a government strategy to fleece the public through the manipulation of fuel prices,? he added.
He said the fuel prices had been increased yet again within a period of about eight weeks ? a situation we have never experienced earlier.
?Now the price of petrol is Rs. 145 and diesel Rs. 118 while today?s price of crude oil in the world market is around USD 74 per barrel. In 2008, when Sri Lanka was buying crude oil at the much higher rate of USD 97 a barrel, petrol was sold at Rs. 120 and diesel at Rs 70. During the nine years in which we ruled the country, world crude oil prices were always high. According to the Central Bank reports, when I first assumed office as President back in November 2005, crude oil was imported to Sri Lanka at around USD 73 per barrel. Thereafter the price of crude oil increased steadily and during the last four years of my government, in 2011, 2012, 2013 and 2014, the average price of crude oil imports was over USD 109 per barrel. Hence the present crude oil price of USD 78 is very low compared to the prices that prevailed when we were in power,? he said.

JO says another fake report on MR is coming soon
	
The Government was attempting to release another fake report like the New York Times report on former President Mahinda Rajapaksa soon, the Joint Opposition (JO) alleged today.
An article appeared recently on New York Times that at least US$7.6 million was dispensed from China Harbour?s account at Standard Chartered Bank to affiliates of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa?s election campaign
Addressing a news conference, JO member and MP Shehan Semasinghe said it was clear that the recent NY Times report had been complied with the initiative of Mangala Samaraweera with the intention of tarnishing the image of former President Rajapaksa.
?Although the incumbent Government attempted to make false allegations against the former President in and through the NY Times, its attempt became a dead duck. Therefore, the group headed by Minister Samaraweera is now attempting to bring another fake report via a NGO funded website belonging to a Western country,? the MP said.
?According to the information we have accumulated, the fake report would be in relation with the misappropriation of funds that had allegedly taken place during the tenure of Mahinda Rajapaksa. These all are false allegations that target the former President who who had become a threat to this Government,? the MP claimed. (Sheain Fernandopulle)

Leptospirosis : Be aware of severe rat fever!
	
?
This bacteria is excreted when these mammals urinate and ends up in soil and water
	?
	The initial acute or septicaemic phase lasts about one week
?
Leptospirosis, commonly known as rat fever, is mainly a disease infecting people working outdoors. This is a disease that occasionally causes serious consequences and even death.?
It?s a bacterial infection brought by animals. Though it?s called rat fever, the germ is carried by other mammals like cattle, pig, goats, dogs, raccoons and bats. This bacteria is excreted when these mammals urinate and ends up in soil and water. The germ can enter humans through abraded skin (scratches, wounds, eczema and shoe cuts or through intact mucous membrane/mouth, genitals)
This disease is a biphasic illness. The initial acute or septicaemic phase lasts about one week. The second phase is an immune phase with circulating antibodies (IgM) accompanied by excretion of the bacteria in the urine.?
?
?
Contest in Sri Lanka
Leptospirosis is a zoonotic disease and one of the main communicable diseases in Sri Lanka. The disease is endemic in Sri Lanka with occasional outbreaks.
Consultant Transfusion Physician Dr. Kumudini Gonsalkorale told the Daily Mirror that the farming community and those who spend much time with animals were susceptible to the disease in Sri Lanka.
?In the rural areas, it?s the farmers and agricultural workers who are mostly affected. In the urban areas the disease often affects the slum dwellers,? Dr. Gonsalkorale said.
?The situation in Sri Lanka is pathetic. The death of the breadwinner makes the whole family destitute. Their voices are never heard. The illness never receives prominence because it mainly affects the lower income group. A death of a poor farmer never affects others. It is only the kith and kin of these poor people who suffer,? Dr. Gonsalkorale affirmed.
?In Sri Lanka, leptospirosis is reported throughout the year. Annually there are two peaks in the disease incidence; at the time of the monsoons, a smaller one during March -May and a larger one during October - December,? she added
?
Even with ICU care, 70% or more of those with lung haemorrages cause death. No definitive treatment is available for these patients with pulmonary haemmorrages 
Dr. Gonsalkorale
?
According to the Epidemiology Unit, there had been a significant increase in reporting and identifying leptospirosis cases over the past few decades since identification of the first confirmed leptospirosis case in 1953. In the year 2008 Sri Lanka reported the largest outbreak of leptospirosis with 7423 suspected cases and 204 deaths. Subsequently, 4980 cases and 145 deaths were reported in 2009 and in 2010 the number of cases was 4553 with 121 dying.
The highly endemic areas are Colombo, Gampaha, Matale, Kurunegala and Kalutara which are known to be overcrowded with agricultural communities and changing weather and environmental factors.
The factors affecting prevalence of the leptospirosis in Sri Lanka can?t be investigated in to. Seasonal analysis is needed in the wet and dry zones corresponding with the main Yala and Maha agricultural seasons. The annual rainfall is mainly associated with the prevalence of leptospirosis in the wet zone while the agricultural environment associated with the prevalence of leptospiros is in the dry zone.?
?
?
The new procedure has been effective that it has reduced the number of deaths reported from the sever form of the rat fever 
Dr. Welivitiya
?
New procedures of control?
Dr. Gonsalkorale said that the pulmonary haemorrages (bleeding into the lungs) which is the severe form of this disease had a very high mortality rate.
This is also called ?Weil?s disease? and it can develop after the acute phase as the second phase of the biphasic illness or can simply present as a single progressive illness. The outcome can become very severe.
?Even with ICU care, 70% or more of those with lung haemorrages cause death. No definitive treatment is available for these patients with pulmonary haemmorrages,? Dr. Gonsalkorale said.
?After considering the high percentage of deaths reported due to the cause of pulmonary haemmorrages, the National Blood Transfusion Service has commenced a procedure called Therapeutic Plasma Exchange (TPE) to control pulmonary haemorrages. This procedure was initiated by the Teaching Hospital of Karapitiya in 2016,? she said.?
Therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) is a treatment that removes plasma from the blood. The removed plasma is then replaced with a substitute. Plasma is the liquid portion of blood. It helps carry blood cells and other substances throughout the body.
Consultant Transfusion Physician of the Blood Bank Dr. Theshanthi Welivitiya said they had carried out plasma exchanges for more than 150 patients since 2016 with pulmonary haemorrhage and percentage of recovery was 70%.
?The new procedure has been effective that it has reduced the number of deaths reported from the sever form of the rat fever,? Dr. Welivitiya said.
?The only issue is that the Colombo South Teaching Hospital is an overcrowded hospital and once again accommodating patients in an ICU becomes a huge problem. The main problem faced is that this expensive machine used for the procedure has to be pushed from place to place in order to treat these patients,? Dr. Welivitiya added.
?
Symptoms? ?
Leptospirosis may present with a wide variety of clinical manifestations. It may also mimic many other diseases such as dengue fever, influenza, meningitis, and hepatitis. Jaundice (yellow discoloration of the skin) is a relatively common symptom in leptospirosis, but is also found in many other diseases involving the liver. However, following symptoms are common when it comes to leptospirosis.? ?

Parents should love, nurture and stimulate children - UNICEF Country Rep.
	
Tim Sutton, Country Representative of the United Nations Children?s Fund (UNICEF)
?
<U+200B>Sri Lanka has an alarming?nutrition deficit?
	Beating children with canes and sticks won?t help
	Country aims to end violence against children by 2030
	Conflict has a lingering effect on society, especially children??
?
We need to be working in a far more joined up effort, so that families and children are better supported. We need to be targeting some of our investments better.
?
Creating a healthy generation of children with potential is a vision of any country. As observed and mentioned, children should be nurtured to take the mantle of the society forward and in the right direction. But whether they have the proper environment to develop to their fullest potential remains a question. In a world where cases of child abuse, violence and neglect get reported every other hour, the opportunities to succeed are often hindered. This violence can affect the brain which can impact the ability of a child to learn and develop knowledge, with lifelong implications. As a country that places much emphasis on the family unit, Sri Lanka is trying to make progress in giving more value to the lives of children. As vulnerable as they have become, it is important to educate parents, relatives, schools and other institutions to protect these children. Speaking to the Daily Mirror, Tim Sutton, Country Representative of the United Nations Children?s Fund (UNICEF) elaborated on a few key aspects that?Sri Lanka needs to immediately?focus on.? ?
?
Child protection in?Sri Lanka?
Child protection has been a main area of concern with the increasing rates of abuse, violence and neglect. ?The formation of the National Child Protection Authority?(NCPA) was a major step taken some years ago,? Sutton said. ?The issues relating to exploitation and abuse of children in Sri Lanka were relatively well-known in comparison to other countries. The abuse that takes place in association with the tourism sector has drawn the attention of the authorities. In 2016 Sri Lanka joined the ?Global Partnership to End Violence Against Children ?and we worked closely with the Government to operationalize this partnership which is based around seven proven interventions. We know what to do, we know how to do it and Sri Lanka is one of the 13 ?pathfinder? countries that are committed to end violence against children by 2030. That?s all good news. That violence, exploitation and abuse of children continue is not good news. That cases are being discussed is good news. But if we can?t quantify the problem it?s very difficult to deal with it. I don?t think we still understand the scale of the problem in Sri Lanka. We therefore need clear data, so that we can address this in the best possible way? added Sutton. He believes that cases of violence against children aren?t permitted, but is ?almost? accepted, as in the case of corporal punishment, in society and that norms have to change. Therefore it?s important to work with the society to promote ?positive discipline? which is non-violence with regard to children. ?We know violence does lasting emotional damage and what we now understand is that it impacts a child?s development? he added. ?Exposure to abuse and violence over several years brings about a chemical reaction in the brain which stops or impedes development. Prolonged exposure impacts on the brain development and it can cost several IQ points. This in turn costs the country and children lose the ability to earn more financially in adulthood, all because of the violence, abuse and neglect that they have experienced. Therefore changing those social norms are important and this is something that every household needs to do. It should no longer be acceptable to abuse a child. We need to extend this to our public institutions, particularly schools. We need to support schools and parents need to demand from schools that physical discipline isn?t what their children need to develop the inquiring minds that will drive Sri Lanka?s social and economic success in future,??he added.? ?
?
Immediate role of parents?
Parents play a pivotal role in moulding the future of children. Without the necessary support, a child will not progress through the developmental stages. Placing emphasis on the newly launched Eat-Play-Love campaign, Sutton pointed out that children should obtain nutritious food in the right amounts at the right time. ?We have a nutrition deficit in Sri Lanka which we need to address,? he stressed. ?It is the responsibility of every parent in particular to make sure that their children are well fed and well nourished. We need to play and stimulate our children. Five minutes of play can develop 300,000 neurons and these neurons make the brain work. And during those first five years of life the brain is developing and adding these connections at a rate that is never repeated. Protection from abuse and neglect and giving children the best possible environment to grow up in ? loving, nurturing and stimulating- is what parents need to do. Parents need to demand that they don?t allow violence against children in any form. A simple way is to ensure that schools don?t use physical modes of punishment to discipline children. The Government has shown leadership and we need to support them to ensure that it becomes even more effective,? he said.? ?
?
The need for?a value-based education system
School is the first place where a child interacts with society. Therefore, treating children with dignity takes them a long way. Cases of physical abuse in schools have made headlines in rural areas and the Government is yet to address such issues. According to the Household Income and Expenditure Survey done by the Census and Statistics Department, only 48.7% of three to five year olds attend preschool. This, when of good quality, helps to foster cognitive and language development, social competency and emotional development. According to Sutton the Ministry of Education is equipped with ideas on how to change the mainstream education system. ?But there?s a heavy emphasis on exams and reaching certain pass marks which are entrenched in society. We need to look at the curriculum ? what children learn and how.? What often happens in classes is that teachers teach those who can understand and those who can?t are left behind. So it?s important to support and educate teachers to teach to all levels of children,? said Sutton.? ?
?
Strengthening the family unit
Research suggests that the first five years of life are critical to a child?s future. However the ?Ending Violence in Childhood : Global Report 2017? reveals that 73.4% of children aged one to 14 experience corporal punishment at home by parents including children under the age of five.?
Therefore too many children are entering adulthood at a disadvantage. In most instances, mothers in rural areas in Sri Lanka travel abroad for foreign employment and leave their children with grandparents, uncles and other relatives leading up to cases of incest, neglect etc. In response to this issue, Sutton said that the Government has taken a regulatory approach to this and if the child is under five years of age the mother cannot leave. ?But we need to make sure that families are supported. Foreign employment is a great income earner for Sri Lanka, but as we develop, everyone would hope that income-earning opportunities will prosper within Sri Lanka and that industries will develop and employment will increase, so that people don?t have to travel abroad to earn.? ??
?
Sri Lanka is one of the 13 ?pathfinder? countries that are committed to end violence
	That cases are being discussed is?good news
	Parents need to demand from schools that physical discipline isn?t what their children
	It is the responsibility of every parent in particular to make sure that their children are well fed
?
Prevailing nutrition deficit?
According to the Demographic Health Survey conducted in 2016 by the Department of Census and Statistics, 17% of children under five are risking development due to stunted growth, resulting from poor nutrition. This survey also revealed that 15.1% of children under five years of age are suffering from ?wasting? and if untreated could lead to chronic malnutrition. ?The figures are a little alarming and have been for some time,? said a concerned Sutton. ?We have quite high levels of stunting and wasting in Sri Lanka and there are pockets where it?s high as well as low. But across the country the figures are worrying. What worries UNICEF is that these figures haven?t improved for the past 10 years which means that we need to be doing things a little differently. Therefore we need to take a far more integrated approach to dealing with poor nutrition in Sri Lanka. It?s not just an issue of health and agriculture but it?s an issue for everyone. We therefore need to support the Government to bring about a concerted, cross-cutting programme to improve these figures.
Sutton further said that this nutrition deficit is costing Sri Lanka as well. ?In the first five years of life, when a child is developing, 75% of the energy that they take in from food goes to developing the brain,? he added. ?Children who are malnourished, or not receiving the correct foods aren?t getting enough energy for brain development. That costs IQ points which limits a child?s ability to develop to its full potential, and ultimately to reach full capacity in adulthood. During the past 20 years the dependency ratio has halved when comparing the number of people working compared to those who are not. What this means is that Sri Lanka is getting over its demographic dividend when it has a huge pool of young people that it can pull it to the workforce for cheap labour. This has happened throughout Asia in China, Vietnam and other countries. They have stimulated growth by pulling in this huge mass of workers and employing? them in factories and other places. We don?t have a huge pool of young people coming into the workforce anymore. Therefore our population pyramid too is distorted as of today. This means that in the next 30 years the dependency ratio will halve again. But for Sri Lanka to maintain its current status in 30 years? time, people need to be twice as productive. Therefore we need to help this generation and the next generation to increase their productivity. We need to do that through education. We need to educate families and communities and make sure that children get the best possible start. This takes us back to the eat-play-love idea. If you get these correct they will be more productive and that?s what Sri Lanka?s future depends on,?he stressed.?
?
?
Suggested improvements?
Sutton agrees that the 30-year ethnic conflict has an impact on the development of the present day child. ?The conflict cost the country around USD 200 billion. That?s a huge deficit to makeup and Sri Lanka has compromised a little bit on the high levels of debt therefore it doesn?t have as much physical freedom that other countries have. But peace has been made and as we move forward in the reconciliation and rebuilding process we should stay on course and build a secure, prosperous Sri Lanka. There are many people who have lost their families and it?s an enormous cost to those families and society. But now we need to move forward. There are no scientific studies that look at the linkages of conflict and the violence in society, but undoubtedly there is a lingering effect. This history is part of what makes Sri Lanka today. Therefore we shouldn?t deny that history, but we need to acknowledge it and move forward,? he added.
Sutton also acknowledged the services extended by people working in the Government sector to support children. ?It?s important to improve those services and make them more responsive to children and families. I know that there is a commitment to make those services better. The fantastic thing about Sri Lanka is that we have those services. Many countries don?t. We have the universal house system, education system and we need to make them better and stronger. When we talk about early childhood development the critical thing is to improve those services that reach out to families and children in an integrated approach, so that people are talking to probation officers while the education officers are setting their standards for early childhood education. We need to be working in a far more joined up effort, so that families and children are better supported. We need to be targeting some of our investments better. We hope this would be one of the critical things that the next Budget addresses. There needs to be a holistic approach that covers areas including the justice system to ensure that cases are taken up in courts more quickly. We have a good system in place and it?s just that we need to make it better and responsive to cater to the needs of all children,?concluded Sutton.?

Prisons Dept. to enlist 2 new hangmen
	
The Prisons Department will call for applications to recruit two hangmen next week to carry out death sentences, Prisons Spokesman Commissioner Thushara Upuldeniya said.
He said the department with the Justice and Prisons Reforms Ministry is to finalize the list of the inmates who received death sentences over drug trafficking and will handover it for the consent of President Maithripala Sirisena within the week.
There have been no executions in Sri Lanka since June 23, 1976, although death sentences were handed down continuously by the High and Supreme courts for murder and drug trafficking convictions.
Earlier, the Government decided to reinstate capital punishment in 2004 for cases of rape, drug trafficking and murder, however, due to significant opposition to the move no executions have been carried out.
There were two gallows in Bogambara, and Welikada prisons however the Bogambara gallows was removed during its relocation to Pallekele.
The department hired two hangmen for duties in 2015 but they later resigned.
The Department spokesman said it had been a difficult task to recruit a hangman as most of them quit due to stress.
Sri Lanka?s first known formal execution -- a hanging, was carried out in 1812 by Sri Lanka?s British colonial rulers. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

Rs.19 mn to Pushpa Rajapaksa Foundation was a donation - CICT
	
Colombo International Container Terminals Limited (CICT) has reiterated that its payment of Rs.19,410,000/- (equivalent to US$150,000), to the Pushpa Rajapaksa Foundation was a donation, in good faith, for the construction of houses for the less privileged, CICT said in a statement.?
It also states, ?This donation was made long after the project concession agreement for the Colombo South Terminal had been signed and construction work on the terminal had already commenced. This payment is clearly reflected in our audited accounts for the relevant year. We therefore categorically reject the implication that the payment is tantamount to a bribe.?
?This issue had already been brought up in the media and was investigated by the relevant authorities three years ago. However, in the wake of these latest reports, we reiterate and bring to the notice of the media and the general public that CICT made a donation to the said foundation, as part of its commitment to Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR), and did not intend it to be, nor believe it to be otherwise.?
?CICT has already provided the required information on this matter to the relevant authorities. The company has no further information to provide on the matter, other than for what has already been provided.?
?For the record, we wish to reiterate that this donation was a part of CICT?s CSR commitment, and in keeping with this commitment, we have also supported other deserving projects such as providing support to the victims of the Koslanda landslide in 2016 with cash donations and rations; major sponsorship of the Wheelchair Tennis programme of Sri Lanka Tennis Association (SLTA); and a donation through the China Merchant Charity Foundation of foldable intraocular lenses and cartridges worth $ 60,000 along with an allocation of $ 200,000 for cataract surgeries for needy patients under the ?Tribute to love, China ? Sri Lanka Free Cataract Surgery Campaign? etc.
Once funding is allocated, CICT believes that the funding so allocated would be utilized for the said projects by the receiving agencies, without CICT having to play a supervisory role as to the implementation of such projects.?

Save the young  from this tobacco monster!
	
?
Even if some crazy tobacco-control freaks get this banned in future, the tobacco industry will still have made a significant new clientele
	?
	We cannot, as decent parents, adults and citizens with an iota of human dignity, allow CTC to rob our children of their health
	?
	Numerous Tobacco Companies world over have introduced various flavoured cigarettes.
?
McDonald?s gives away a free toy with meals intended for kids. So what? No big deal, right??
Do they give away a free toy with a salad? Well, no. Ever thought why? Let?s give it a try.
If you check what kind of meals they do give away, they are usually burgers, fries and soda. These are the ones that bring the highest profit margin. And, they are the ones most loaded with salt and sugar; in other words, most unhealthy.?
Did you know that obesity with the risk of diabetes, heart disease and cholesterol issues is rising in children?
Science tells us that salt and sugar-loaded foods, such as burgers, fries and soda, are the ones which are more likely to ensure that the child would make a habit of eating them.?
This is not so with salads.?
So, it is profitable, in the long-run, to get children started on a lifelong journey of soda, burgers and fries.?
You don?t have to give away toys when they grow up!
Furthermore, it is pretty clear why they give away free-toys. More business! More clients! More child customers.?
It is not a secret that they use the media and movie world to create a demand for these useless pieces of plastic which they call toys.
Fast food companies learned this trick arguably from Tobacco Companies. However, the teacher hasn?t forgotten the lesson.
Recently, it was reported that Ceylon Tobacco Company ?has launched a new cigarette, which is a line extension of their regular Gold Leaf product, in a bid to attract new segments ? possibly females.??
According to the report this red berry flavoured cigarette ?was put to the market with the intention of injecting modernity into the brand?, and also targeting, in addition to women, ?more sophisticated ones who are willing to try out new flavours, similar to the menthol products?.
This shows us how the tobacco industry thinks:
More customers...
How to create more customers...
Actually, women hardly smoke in Sri Lanka. Sooo..... LET?S TARGET WOMEN.
Also, there is much demand for things considered Modern, Western, upper class and foreign. Therefore, let?s make it red-berry-flavoured, rather than ambilla-flavoured.?
And - no need to make a statement over that - but we will continue with our goal of targeting children and youth.?
Fruit-flavoured cigarettes to recruit children into this habit? No, No!
It?s Fruit-flavoured Cigarettes to cater to the needs of young adult smokers ? possibly females!
Once the new users, children and, maybe women, are recruited, they will form a habit.?
Soon, they will graduate to other brands. No need to supply the fruit-flavour all the time. Even if some crazy tobacco-control freaks get this banned in future, the tobacco industry will still have made a significant new clientele.?
Scientific evidence shows that fruit and menthol-flavoured cigarettes are more appealing to young people.?
Numerous Tobacco Companies the world over have introduced various flavoured cigarettes. Currently the e-cigarette industry (which is mostly owned by the same Tobacco Companies) has introduced an array of flavoured e-cigarettes with names such as:
Magnificent Menthol, Cherry Crush, Vivid Vanilla,Glacier Mint, Pina Colada, Mint Chocolate, Caramel Caf?, and, of course,Blueberry Strawberry Mint and Berry Cobbler!
To counter this heinous attempt of Tobacco Companies to recruit our children, many governments and jurisdictions have introduced progressive people-friendly legislature. For an example, the European Union?s Tobacco Products Directive bans flavourings (such as candy, vanilla, fruit, spice, herbs) in cigarettes that give the product a ?characterising? flavour other than tobacco.?
Our own NATA (National Authority on Alcohol and Tobacco) Act states that a ?person shall not manufacture, import, sell or offer for sale, any tobacco product as may be prescribed by regulations.??
So, the authorities only need to prescribe what isn?t allowed, which they have already done!
In September 2016, a Gazette notification officiated a regulation under NATA act banning manufacture, import, display and sale of any flavoured tobacco products. So, what the CTC has done appears to be illegal!
We need to bring this to the notice of?The President, The Prime Minister, The Minster of Health, Customs Department, Excise Department, National Medicines Regulatory Authority Other relevant Government Officials
Why not ban the entire cigarette industry??
This is what some pundits ask. Well, it is not difficult to understand why it cannot be done overnight.?
However, we cannot, as decent parents, adults and citizens with an iota of human dignity, allow CTC to rob our children of their health in broad daylight like this.

Shall we make swimming a mandatory skill in SL?
	
The nail biting episode of Thai caves got the whole world glued to the television sets for a week. While the rescue operation was midway, a school principal and three others here in Sri Lanka died due to drowning in Ek Gal Oya in Ampara after their boat capsized. Even otherwise we hear about drowning incidents at regular intervals either in the sea, rivers and streams or tanks occasionally with tourists too becoming victims.??
An island surrounded by the mighty and unpredictable Indian Ocean and endowed with nearly 40 rivers of which 16 are more than 100 km long, and dozens of giant tanks and thousands of mini tanks, ours is one country that an outsider would claim a truly blessed land. No wonder we gave the etymological root of the English word serendipity, after being called Serendib - the island of fortune, by the Persians.? ?
There?s no doubt that our abundant water resources have been our lifeline for millennia. However it?s time we also thought about the dangers they pose when we are unprepared. Sri Lanka does not have a law mandating wearing life jackets for local and foreign tourists while on boat safaris. While such regulations would save many lives it is also important that the government makes swimming a compulsory skill at least in the primary classes. The regular floods due to overflowing of rivers and tanks which have now become a perennial feature and number of deaths due to those, only go to heighten the importance of learning swimming as a life skill. Not many knew that several Sri Lankan swimmers and divers living overseas came down voluntarily to help save lives of people during the 2016 deluge. Despite their help and also of the navy some, 101 Sri Lankans lost lives in the tragedy.??
True that it will take some time to equip all schools with swimming pools, but if the government is really keen on the move it?s likely that private donors and companies would come forward to help, especially the out station schools. Also internationally reputed swimmers like Julian Bolling who have already groomed hundreds of seasoned swimmers, the Sri Lanka Navy diving unit and the Sri Lanka Aquatic Sports Union (SLASU) can help train swimming coaches. In fact Bolling?s students were involved in rescue operations during almost all incidents of floods in the past few years.??
Perhaps realizing the need for swimming training for Sri Lankan students here, the United Nations a few years back offered to launch a project to train them in swimming. However, may be owing to poor response from authorities, nothing came about afterwards.??
The Thai caves adventure also reminds us of the need to increase the number of trained divers and form a group of about 100 volunteers so that they can be sent out during floods and other emergencies. It was a question asked by many, what would have happened to the hapless kids and coach if the incident took place here in Sri Lanka instead of the better equipped Thailand? It is indeed a good question to ask. At the rate we mishandle matters here-both political and otherwise - chances were that the rescue operation ended up being a disaster unless we allowed a more experienced country to handle the operation.??
Rainy days it appears, have come to stay, and one hears about flooding of areas almost every month. Besides, there?s no way of one preventing children and locals and foreigners venturing into rivers, tanks and the seas. Making swimming a mandatory skill for children could also make the adults realize the importance of it and the government can organize training for willing adults too, either for their own safety and also to save others when the need arises.??
One hopes the government would give a serious thought to this idea.??

SL to get third int'l airport
	
Sri Lanka is to have a third International Airport that will be constructed in Hingurakgoda as per the master plan that had been drawn up for the development of Trincomalee, which was launched in Colombo yesterday.
The Hingurakgoda International Airport is in line with the vision highlighted in the plan to develop Trincomalee as the Eastern Gateway to Sri Lanka by the year 2050.
?Trincomalee would be re-positioned as the ?Eastern Tourism Hub with increased regional connectivity realized through the Colombo-Trincomalee economic corridor development and the proposed Hingurakgoda International Airport,? the vision framework of the plan said.
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said the roadmap to develop Sri Lanka as the hub of the Indian Ocean will be completed with this master plan. ?When Sri Lanka was a hub in the Indian Ocean in the old days there were several ports. Today we have focused on the Colombo Port and Hambantota. Colombo will be important with the development of the Western part of India as well as the development taking place in Iran. Ships which use the Suez Canal to get to countries such as Singapore go past Hambantota which thus makes developing the Southern Port even more important. Countries in the Bay of Bengal region will develop greatly within the next 20 years. Populations in that region will reach three billion by 2050. Therefore, we will have to develop Trincomalee as the Eastern gate,? he said. He said what was left now was for the government to come up with a development plan for Jaffna. (Yohan Perera)

SL won the toss and opted to bat
	
South Africa and Sri Lanka are ready to kick-off their first Test match in Galle.?
Sri Lanka are yet to recover from the ball tampering saga from the Caribbean. They're still without their usual skipper Dinesh Chandimal and their usual coach. Also the thought of bowling at his personal fortress isn't apparently enough to get their spearhead Rangana Herath fit. But Mathews should return and that should help Lakmal build on his heroics at Barbados. South Africa meanwhile head into a darker post-AB, post-Morkel era. But Steyn returning should neutralize one half. He's fighting a wretched battle with series starting matches - getting injured in four out the last six first-match-of-the-series he's played in.
Teams:
Sri Lanka (Playing XI): Dimuth Karunaratne, Danushka Gunathilaka, Dhananjaya de Silva, Kusal Mendis, Angelo Mathews, Roshen Silva, Niroshan Dickwella(w), Dilruwan Perera, Rangana Herath, Suranga Lakmal(c), Lakshan Sandakan
South Africa (Playing XI): Dean Elgar, Aiden Markram, Hashim Amla, Faf du Plessis(c), Temba Bavuma, Quinton de Kock(w), Vernon Philander, Keshav Maharaj, Kagiso Rabada, Dale Steyn, Tabraiz Shamsi

Some mild reflections on history lessons
	
?
Fernand Braudel (1902-1985), the greatest historian of his generation, was possibly the greatest historian of the preceding century. His methods, profound as they were, have influenced historians, anthropologists, and ethnologists the world over. By the time of his death, his approach had been affirmed and imbibed by institutions everywhere. No one who has read his accounts of the Mediterranean, of the rise of capitalism in Europe (which was destined, as he surmised, to be the bedrock of the free market), and indeed of the rise of civilisations in general, can quite contend with his broad sweep. Regi Siriwardena, who wrote the obituary on the man in 1986, observed correctly that his perspective, supported by a wealth of local and specific detail, seemed to ?move constantly from the long panning shot to the zoom into close-up.? Isaac Deutscher once compared Trotsky?s History of the Russian Revolution, with its technique of moving between long shots of mass action and individual close-ups, to Eisenstein?s influential film Battleship Potemkin. Braudel was a little like that, except that not being a committed leftist or Marxist, he was concerned with the political only insofar as it significantly influenced the evolution of a society.? ?
This is not a tribute to Fernand Braudel or for that matter Leon Trotsky. This is an attempt at collecting some thoughts on the way history is disseminated among a population. More specifically, our population. These thoughts are a sum total of conversations with students I?ve had, research I?ve conducted, and inferences I?ve made with regard to the curriculum we are taught regardless of their limitations.? ?
?
To inculcate such an interest, what is needed is not myth after legend paraded and taught in the name of a superior culture, but a method of teaching which provides enough information
?
A friend of mine, a keen practitioner of history and historiography, once wrote somewhere that even at the time of the British, we were taught about our kings and heritage. Ceylon history, according to this friend, was transformed into a hotchpotch called social studies during the Sirimavo Bandaranaike regime and this despite the seemingly Sinhala Buddhist credentials of the State. The results, he then observed, were to make themselves felt over the next two decades, as they ended up depriving our society of the cultural identity a civilisation needs if it is to anchor its future in its past. Given this, the fact that many students are growing up without any proper knowledge of our culture, traditional values, and heritage was to be expected. The conversations I?ve had with students bear this out: only around two or three of 10 I?ve talked to have a clear, sustained interest in the subject. Worrying, don?t you think?? ?
We can debate over the reasons for this tragedy. We can indict policymakers and educationists for reducing the value of history as a subject. But there are more ways than one of looking at a problem. The ?transformation? of history into social studies, for instance, while spelling out adverse effects much later on, was not an arbitrary decision taken on the whims of the State. The sole purpose of it was to effect a change on the way students thought about the subject. By collating history with geography and civic studies, it was felt at the time, links could be drawn between disciplines and these could be explained to children as part of an effort to educate them not on memorising dates, but on understanding how their societies and villages were formed in the past. Another friend of mine contended with the above viewpoint on the basis that this new curriculum, based on the renowned Reggio Emilia method pioneered in post-war Italy, facilitated relationships between the student, his or her teachers, and their surroundings. That it deteriorated in later decades to a shoddy mimesis of its former self was, according to him, the fault of the post-Bandaranaike administrations.? ?
?
Discovery after discovery has been made of the civilisations that existed before Vijaya?s arrival, the civilisations of the yakshas and the nagas
?
Social studies
Whether or not the curriculum shift was the reason behind the sorry state of affairs we have in the classroom today, it is clear that blaming that does and will not magically resolve the problems we are facing today. It is also clear that while social studies brought together seemingly disparate subjects, it did not, as is commonly assumed today, turn history into an achcharu-fied subject. On the contrary, being a student of social studies myself, I can testify to its value, both for unearthing the subtle links between geography and culture and for inculcating in us a love for discovering relationships between different subjects. Braudel, let?s not forget, pioneered this method of historiography in his work. Social studies alone, thus, cannot be the reason. The real reasons exist elsewhere, and before I delve into them, I?ll list them out here briefly: the choice of eras we are made to look into; the lack of receptivity among students; the ideology at the heart of our historical discourse; and the absence of motivation for those students to pursue it on their own, outside the classroom.? ?
Isn?t it a little strange that no attempt has been made at properly teaching our history from the Pre-Vijaya era? Discovery after discovery has been made of the civilisations that existed before Vijaya?s arrival, the civilisations of the yakshas and the nagas. These are clans and cults which have been recorded by Indian texts, even the Mahabharatha. Instead they are relegated to the status of myths, and in the end, they remain just that: myths. One of the students I talked to, who was earnest about the subject, and about the Ramayana and its connection with Sri Lankan history, told me rather bluntly that none of the discoveries made in the recent past, and their historical implications, has been taught in the classroom. ?To be quite frank, our history is not the history that flows from Vijaya?s arrival. It is one which predates that event by 10,000 years,? he argued. To ignore 10,000 years this way, I feel, is a crime.? ?
?
Ceylon history, according to this friend, was transformed into a hotchpotch called social studies during the Sirimavo Bandaranaike regime
?
As for ideology, there are those who claim that our syllabus promotes a domineering mindset: Sinhala Buddhist. Such allegations are, at the end of the day, baseless, because a country that has been inhabited by a folk culture that is Sinhalese and a state religion that is Buddhist cannot be expected to censor its past to conform to outside paradigms. But promoting chauvinism has its side effects: it does not stimulate enough interest for one?s past. To inculcate such an interest, what is needed is not myth after legend paraded and taught in the name of a superior culture, but a method of teaching which provides enough information for the ardent student to delve deeper on his own.?
?
Later historic events?
This is tied up with another problem: more often than not, the syllabus promotes the worst of both worlds: it is too heavy to leave room for further research, and it is also too small in that what needs to be remembered is a colossal series of dates and their corresponding events. That the Uva Wellassa Uprising and the Matale Rebellion happened over such and such a time, after all, is a point of fact that can be easily compounded with the reasons for those events and how they had an impact on later historic events. And yet, they are not compounded, only taught separately.? ?
When French schools taught world history by dividing it between two periods - ?1914 to 1939? and ?1940 to the present? - Braudel contended that what it yielded was a ?prodigious mass of dates and events? which would have to be studied ?twice over.? There?s the problem in memorising dates and events and separating the one from the other: they end up separating space from time, cause from effect, one facet from another. ?Why teach in bits and pieces a subject which is a whole?? Braudel asked in his preface to A History of Civilisations. A valid question, one must concede, considering that a similar crime is being committed in how English is taught here: literature is divorced from grammar to such an extent that textbooks, even with those colourful activities, induce boredom (not to mention those comprehension passages that stimulate nothing in one?s mind). Connecting the one with the other would of course not be the only answer to the problem, but it would go a long, long way in encouraging the child to go deeper, to remember: memorising, effective though it may be in the short term, can only promote indifference and apathy in the longer term.? ?
History cannot be reflected on properly if all our classrooms and schools are concerned about is making the child memorise particular events or incidents, the factors that led to such events, and the time periods in which they occurred. No. History, it must be ascertained once and for all, is ingrained in our consciousness in ways no other subject can really equal. As with literature and language, which are taught together in Sinhala and Tamil but are separated in English, dates and events have repercussions which exist beyond the confines of the classroom. That is where libraries matter. Where research and delving deeper into those little details which don?t seem to cut much ice in the textbook matter. In this regard, one other reason why we are so poor when it comes to the subject is a fact which can explain why we are so poor when it comes to our schools and their systems of teaching and learning: because we are made to study so many dates and events, we are taught to remember them for their surface value. And because we are made to remember their surface value, we tend to let go of the need to question, to understand, in one word, to be interested.? ?
That is a tragedy. A national tragedy. Fernand Braudel would have agreed, I?m sure.? ?

## Title: Sushma  Swaraj?s  gumption and India?s abiding arrogance
## Section: Opinion
## Date: 12 July 2018 12:00 am
Sushma  Swaraj?s  gumption and India?s abiding arrogance
	
The Indian External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj, addressing top diplomats posted in neighbouring countries (July 3, 2018), opined that India should not focus on competing with China on resources. That?s sensible considering resource-mismatch. She also said that India must closely watch all Chinese activities. That?s sensible too, considering India?s economic and strategic interests in the region. This (and what follows) has been reported in the Hindustani Times of July 8, 2018.? ?
?
?Debt trap? is not something that naive leaders of nations walk into blindly
?
She has also said, ?India must push ahead with full vigour its own work, presumably in neighboring countries. That also makes sense if ?work? is about building houses, bridges, roadways and railways, or if it is about trade agreements that are mutually beneficial and not heavily tilted in India?s favour nor scripted in ways that India can interfere in Sri Lanka?s domestic affairs.? ?
?Work? on the other hand can include things like violating airspace, dropping dhal, helping out a terrorist organization that India helped create, funded, trained and armed. Work could also mean something like the Indo-Lanka Accord, clearly an abrasive encounter which left Sri Lanka scarred, courtesy of a) giving a new lease of life to the LTTE and dragging for a further 22 years a war that took a heavy toll on the country and the citizens.? ?
Let?s be generous and assume that Swaraj was talking about hospitals, ambulances and sharing of technology. I don?t think anyone would object.? ?
Here?s the rub, though. Swaraj says that India ?must educate friends in the neighbourhood about how a certain kind of engagement with Beijing can have negative consequences for them.? The Hindustani Times describes the discussion Swaraj had with the diplomats as follows: ?The broad sense in the meeting was that in Pakistan, China?s economic and political dominance had only grown; in Bangladesh, while the Chinese have made huge economic commitments, many in Dhaka were wary of the ?debt trap? Sri Lanka found itself in; in Sri Lanka, while the government remained politically friendly to India, its economic ties with China had continued apace.?? ?
Let?s limit this discussion to Sri Lanka. We can understand India?s apprehension about China?s economic ties with any country in her neighbourhood. The concerns about ?growing economic and political dominance? is understandable. The observation regarding Sri Lanka?s ties with China is a statement of fact. Nothing wrong in that. Dhaka being wary of the ?debt trap Sri Lanka found itself in? is an observation too. Nothing wrong with that, except of course that term (debt trap) needs to be fleshed out a bit, especially the ?trap? part of it.? ?
The New York Times article about a Chinese state-owned company getting the previous regime ?to cough up a port? mentioned the term. It?s not new though. ?Debt trap? is not something that naive leaders of nations walk into blindly. In many cases, the trap is seen but concerns of personal gain have frequently outweighed the interests of the particular country and citizenry. The literature on the pernicious role of the Bretton Woods institutions and how the trappers used coercion, threat and bribes to obtain agreement for representatives of those intended to be trapped is extensive. Much has been coughed up in the past 74 years.? ?
?
The broad sense in the meeting was that in Pakistan, China?s economic and political dominance had only grown; in Bangladesh
?
In short ?debt trap? is not news. The identity of the ?trapper? is only of academic interest. India?s concern is the identity given economic and strategic ramifications, Sri Lanka?s concern should be about the fact of entrapment, but that again, as pointed out, is old news. It is not that Sri Lanka was unfettered a la debt before China moved in.? ?
?Trapping? is not only about debt. It can come in the form of trade agreements. It can also take the form of arm-twisting weak leaders lacking both imagination and confidence in the people to extract constitutional amendments that serve the arm-twister. That?s what India did in July 1987. Rajiv Gandhi, who bragged that it marked ?the beginning of the Bhutalization of Sri Lanka,? trapped Sri Lanka in a constitutional amendment (13th) that gave credence to Eelamist myth-modelling as per the boundaries (drawn by the British and not supported by history) demarcating an imaginary ?traditional homeland? and, as things turned out, a long drawn struggle to eliminate terrorism, an exercise which, as pointed out, cost Sri Lanka much.? ?
?
India has always treated her neighbours as though they were poor cousins, to be ?looked after?
?
What?s most objectionable about Swaraj?s position is the condescension. She wants her diplomats to tutor the neighbouring countries. Sure, it?s not that the leaders of the countries mentioned (Pakistan, Afghanistan, Nepal, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka) are rare intellectuals also endowed with courage and enjoying the full backing of the respective peoples, but this stated need ?to educate? them is clearly out of order, especially considering Swaraj is the minister in charge of external affairs and was addressing a group of diplomats. Nothing diplomatic there, but even if she had couched her directives in ?diplospeak? it is still obnoxious and objectionable.? ?
India has always treated her neighbours as though they were poor cousins, to be ?looked after? since ?they are helpless and can?t take care of themselves? or worse, treat them like glorified slaves relegated to menial work to serve their rich and powerful cousins who they can address as ?brother? or ?sister? but who nevertheless operate as lord and lady.? ?
So, India knows what?s best for Sri Lanka or is it that India knows what Sri Lanka should or should not do to deliver what?s best for India? I believe it is the latter. That?s fine, because India should (as it always does) look after India?s interests. However, Sri Lanka doesn?t need India to tell what?s best for Sri Lanka.? ?
Perhaps Sri Lanka should re-think all relations with all countries. I say ?all countries? for a reason. For example, the current regime believed that the West would bail it out, but as things turned out the regime found out that the West was broke. So they opted for the Chinese debt trap or rather to remain fettered to China rather than to the West (the preferred slave-master).? ?
However, the traps agreed to and the getting out of such traps should be Sri Lanka?s business, not India?s. And not least of all because India hasn?t really been a friend. It has always been a pound-of-flesh friend who, unlike China, wanted Sri Lanka to inhabit India?s version of Sri Lanka?s reality.? ?
Sucks. To put it bluntly.? ?

The bus culture in Sri Lanka stinks!
	
?
The private bus industry is reaching a deteriorated condition. This situation is tarnishing the reputation of the country.? ?
Needless to say several countries in the world have better transport services, hence commenters can travel conveniently compared to Sri Lanka. We must be ashamed of our transport system.? ??
In Sri Lanka people are packed into buses like sardines. They can?t travel in comfort.? Bus commuters in Sri Lanka are forced to hear the indecent language used by the conductor. They also have to put up with the loud music played inside these buses.? The sound is so loud it deafens you.? ?
When inside the bus there is no polite talk at all. Bus journeys are an unpleasant experience. Most conductors don?t know how to talk to commuters. Only a handful of them indulge in gentle talk.? ?
?
Some bus conductors don?t give the balance to passenger. The passenger has to go behind the conductor to collect the balance. This bus culture? brings great injustice to the public.? ?
?
When a tourist travels by bus in Sri Lanka, he notices the culture that?s present. Is it fair by the rest of the citizens when foreigners judge our culture through what they witness in these buses. This behaviour tarnishes the country?s name, which we have built since the time of Prince Vijaya.? ?
On hearing this unprintable language small children get spoiled.? This language dulls the mind. They don?t know how to talk respectfully to a person.? ?
Some bus conductors don?t give the balance to passenger. The passenger has to go behind the conductor to collect the balance. This bus culture? brings great injustice to the public.? ?
When an elderly person boards a bus, the conductor may order him to go to the rear of the bus. But when he wants to disembark the conductor orders him to get down in a jiffy. This is so inhuman. They don?t consider even his age. How can an elderly person get down from a bus in such a hurry?? ??
Going by the principles of Buddhism we must respect our elders. In private buses most elders become frustrated. If a patient travels in such a bus his ailment aggravates. It is high time that the Government takes measures to correct these shortcomings in the private bus industry.? ?
First of all the Government should impose a set of rules to instill discipline in the private bus industry. Wrongdoers should be punished if they breach the rules. Their licenses should be canceled.? ?
Nobody can destroy our culture which is descending from the time of? Prince Vijaya. Maintain some standards in the private bus industry.?

I must condemn the recent statement by Vijayakala Maheswaran wishing for a return of a? Prabharakan
	As a politician representing Jaffna district, she must surely be aware of the people?s suffering
	UNP MPs without pointing fingers at the Leadership must turn the searchlight within and see where they went wrong
	No supporter says this government is perfect. They have a long way to go and much more to do
?
?
We seem to have many in the former regime, wandering In a wonderland, shooting their mouths off at any given opportunity. This brings to mind a Churchillian saying ?Before they get up, they do not know what they are going to say; when they are speaking, they do not know what they are saying; and when they have sat down, they do not know what they have said?. The former ruler sheds crocodile tears about a lack of law and order and murders, when both time and space are insufficient to list the unprecedented incidents of this nature, which were committed during his tenure of office. He refers to the government as a Bull and Buffalo Government. What about the diverse herd he heads, made up of rogue elephants amidst others of varying political hues, whose behavior patterns are lower than those of the laws of the jungle??
?
The UNP?s second line of command, on the contrary, has all qualified young people. Memories are way, way too short in this country and politicians like former leaders, seem to suffer from selective amnesia as well. They encourage doctors to strike resulting in breaking the Hippocratic oath; which affects the underprivileged who cannot afford private hospitals. They encourage other strikes which again affects the populace of the nation as a whole. So many debts, so much extravagance to enhance personal glory, was indulged in by them, using public funds even for family memorials, so many white elephants which brought this nation to its knees economically. This government is working hard to retrieve all this in a concentrated effort, to bring our nation back to the Paradise it once was. The former government basked in the glory of being happy warriors of squandermania!?
The former first lady stayed at a luxurious hotel in Paris at government expense, which the Queen of England rejected as being too expensive! Anyone attacking or guilty of sexual assault has been arrested under this government. Did this happen under the former one? We all know how a rapist and murderer was protected till The British authorities took a firm stand. Then and only then was action taken.??
As a woman, I must harshly condemn the recent statement by former State Minister Vijayakala Maheswaran wishing for a return of a? Prabharakan. Hitler and he were as bad as each other. I do not think any sane person would want a return to fascism and terrorism practiced by them both. Vijayakala lives comfortably in the heart of Colombo 7, in a mansion far removed from the torture her people in North suffered at the hands of the LTTE. But as a politician representing that district, she must surely be aware of their suffering. How children were forcibly taken away and made to join the LTTE.?
How families were afraid to protest or come out of their homes because they feared for their lives at the hands of the LTTE. If she doesn?t know all this, she is unfit to be an MP and even more unfit to be a Minister. She was an embarrassment so it?s a good thing she decided to resign, resulting in good riddance of bad rubbish. Wasn?t she accused of protecting a rapist and murderer once? What about the millions of women in the South who were left widows and their children fatherless because of killings by the LTTE. Wasn?t her own husband killed by them? It must surely be a world?s first when a wife heaps accolades on one whose terrorist party murdered her husband. Here again, we hear shouts of protest about her words from the JO. But isn?t Karuna who killed so many policemen during the attack on Dalada Maligawa which was led by him, as much a terrorist and murderer as Prabhakaran. But the former leader took him into his fold and even made him a Minister! The UNP has never taken any LTTE?er into the party.??
?
This government is working hard to retrieve all this in a concentrated effort, to bring our nation back to the Paradise it once was. The former government basked in the glory of being happy warriors of squandermania
?
No supporter says that this government is perfect. They have a long way to go and much more to do. Promises made at the elections must be kept. First among these is for quick action against wrongdoers, the corrupt, those guilty of murders of journalists, whisking those who attacked them away in white vans.This must be done fast and people must be reminded again and again about these atrocities. This government has reduced the price of medicine,introduced insurance for schoolchildren, reduced fees for cataract operations,increased salaries of public servants, but there is more to be done.The most important things are, that we now have freedom to say and write what we want, without fear and an Independent Judiciary.?
UNP MPs without pointing fingers at the Leadership must turn the searchlight within and see where they went wrong. Many of them spend far too much time abroad or in the social swing in Colombo. I recall the Prime Minister when I was on the working committee, telling them that they must spend Friday to Sunday in their electorates, talking to the people, explaining things to them and finding out their views and woes. I wonder how many of them do that. Their should be monitoring to check from the grassroots level whether MP?s visit and move with the people in their electorates.??
This is important. I think this Churchillian phrase is apt to describe Prime Minister Ranil WIckremesinghe. ?The only guide to a man is his conscience; the only shield to his memory is the rectitude and sincerity of his actions? . But the time has come to be tougher with MP?s, instill more discipline in them and in the public service and for quicker action against the corrupt whichever side of the political fence they may stand on. People misinterpret gentlemanly virtues as weakness, and often take advantage of kindness. But I?m proud that he does stand alone and tall in the political arena against the vindictive slander heaped on him in abundance, by never slandering back but turning the other cheek. That is greatness at its best as I see it.??
?
?O God of Earth and Altar. Bow down and hear our cry,??
Our earthly rulers falter, our people drift and die.??
From all that terror teaches, from lies of tongue and pen,? ?
From all the easy speeches that comfort cruel men.?
From sleep and from damnation,? ?
Deliver us. Good Lord!??

While welcoming President Maithripala Sirisena to execute drug traffickers who have been sentenced to death, Cardinal Malcolm Ranjith said today there is more to be done to stop the criminals organizing crimes while being in the prison in addition to subjecting them to capital punishment.
? We will support President Maithripala Sirisena?s decision to subject those who organize crime while being in the prison to death sentence but we also feel that there is more to be done,? Cardinal Ranjith told a media briefing this evening.
?We understand that even prison officers also support the criminals to organize crime while in prison and therefore it is our belief that political leadership of the country should carry out investigations and penalize the prison officers as well if they are found helping the inmates to carry out various crimes,? he added.?
