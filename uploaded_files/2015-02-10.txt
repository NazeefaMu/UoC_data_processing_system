Charlie Chaplin?s first Oscar is reported stolen
	
	PARIS ? Charlie Chaplin?s 1929 honorary Oscar statuette was stolen in Paris late last month from the offices of the Association Chaplin, according to the organization.
	The Association Chaplin is a Swiss organization, with Paris offices, that aims to protect the name, image and rights linked to Charlie Chaplin?s work. Its director, Kate Guyonvarch, could not provide additional details on the theft, but said via email, ?We and the Chaplin family are extremely shaken by this loss, and trust that the police will get to the bottom of the break-in very soon.?
	The French newspaper Le Parisien, quoting an anonymous police source, reported that several pens that had belonged to the British star were also stolen and that each was worth 80,000 euros. The same source told Le Parisien that the burglary was the work of ?perfectly informed? individuals who had specifically targeted the Chaplin memorabilia.
	Some pre-1950 statuettes have fetched hundreds of thousands of dollars in auctions. (These days, a winner wishing to sell an Oscar must offer the Academy the opportunity to buy it back for $1. That rule does not apply to older statuettes.)
	Mr. Chaplin, who died in 1977 at the age of 88, received the honorary Oscar during the very first Academy Awards in 1929 for ?acting, writing, directing and producing ?The Circus,?? which featured Mr. Chaplin?s iconic Tramp, the disheveled and bumbling character he portrayed in many of his silent films.
	Mr. Chaplin also received an honorary Oscar in 1972, ?for the incalculable effect he had in making motion pictures the art form of this century,? but was awarded only one regular Academy Award throughout his whole career, for the score of ?Limelight,? in 1973.
	A representative for the Association Chaplin said the organization had been planning to lend the 1929 award to a museum dedicated to Charlie Chaplin that is opening next year in Switzerland, where the actor spent the last 25 years of his life.(nytimes)

He said he had not attended the Independence Day ceremony because the Chief of Defence Staff and the Army Commander who gave false evidence against him were there. (Lahiru Pothmulla)Pix by Kushan Pathiraja

Hire lawyer to get back boats: TN
	
The State government on Monday urged the Indian High Commissioner YK Sinha in Colombo to make one more attempt with Lankan authorities to release the 81 boats of Tamil Nadu fishermen without insisting on applications from the boat owners.
?If it is not possible, arrangements may be made to engage lawyers to take up the matter in Sri Lankan courts for an early release of the boats. The legal expenses will be borne by Tamil Nadu government,?? the Fisheries Secretary S Vijayakumar said in his communication to Sinha on Monday.
This step is in consonance with the procedure indicated in the letter of the Counsellor (Cons), High Commission of India, Colombo, dated February 5.
He had said the boat owners were required to engage lawyers to file a motion in the respective courts for advancing the dates of hearing of the cases and requesting release of the boats. The Fisheries Secretary? said the Tamil Nadu government would depute the Assistant Director of Fisheries, Rameswaram, and an Inspector of Fisheries with the power of attorney from the boat owners to follow up on the issue in Sri Lankan courts to have the? boats released.

Sudarman remanded
	
	ITN News and Current Affairs Deputy Director Sudarman Radaliyagoda today remanded till February 24 by Colombo Additional Magistrate Priyantha Liyanage over his alleged involvement in the abduction of a child from the custody of his mother.
	The abducted child was used in advertisements on behalf of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa during the presidential election campaign.
	Radaliyagoda was earlier ordered to make a statement to the Sri Lanka Police Children and Women?s Bureau.
	The Bureau told Court that the investigations were not yet over and according to the investigations carried out so far Radaliyagoda was a wanted person and therefore requested that he be remanded.
	Counsel Sanjaya Gamage appearing for Radaliyagoda said his client had gone to the Bureau on his own accord without any notice from the Bureau and made a statement.
	He said his client was a public servant who was bound to carry out the orders of his superiors and that the video footage was originally telecast over Rupavahini and thereafter telecast over ITN.
	The Counsel said the responsibility for telecasting the video footage had to be taken by the Chairman and not by his client.
	He said the Bureau had launched the investigations from the wrong end because of political reasons.
	The Bureau had already produced six suspects Samith Nuwan Nandasiri, R. M. Dayawansa, Upul Priyankara, Lalith Chaturange, Sarathchandra Gunathilake and Sudarman Radaliyagoda accusing them of having aiding and abetting in the abduction of the child.
	Upul Priyankara and Lalith Madurasinghe were earlier released on bail. Counsel Sanjaya Gamage Shantha Herath Akalanka Ukwatte appeared for the suspects. (TFT)

Iran naval flotilla docks in SL
	
	The Iranian Navy's 33rd naval fleet has docked at the port of Colombo in Sri Lanka as Iran seeks to expand its naval presence in international waters.
	The Iranian flotilla, consisting of the Bandar Abbas auxiliary ship and Naqdi destroyer, arrived at the port, the largest in Sri Lanka as well as in south Asia, Monday morning after travelling approximately 5,000 km, Press TV reported.
	The flotilla, which had been dispatched earlier this month on a mission to protect shipping lines in the area, is scheduled to stay in the port for three days.
	The flotilla managed to identify more than 120 military and non-military units through interception, electronic tracking and visual surveillance during the voyage.
	Visiting senior naval officials of Sri Lanka is among the programmes of the naval forces on board the flotilla.
	In recent years, Iran's navy has been increasing its presence in international waters to protect naval routes and provide security for merchant vessels and tankers.
	In line with international efforts to combat piracy, the Iranian Navy has also been conducting anti-piracy patrols in the Gulf of Aden since November 2008 to safeguard the vessels involved in maritime trade, especially the ships and oil tankers owned or leased by Iran. (nerve)

Indian boats to be released before President?s Indian visit
	
Sri Lanka will release all the 87 Indian boats in its custody before President Maithripala Sirisena?s three-day visit to India beginning on February 15, Indian Express reported today.
The judicial process is already on in the courts at Kayts, Mannar, Point Pedro and Trincomalee.
On Thursday, the Attorney General, who had filed cases against the fishermen for poaching in Lankan waters, is expected to tell the courts that he has no objection to the release of the boats. The courts would then order their release.
There are 81 boats in the Northern Province and six in the Eastern province. However, some 15 boats anchored in Mannar have reportedly suffered heavy damage. It remains to be seen if these too will be repatriated.
India, on its part, has agreed to release the 22 Lankan boats in its custody, the sources said.
There is much bonhomie between the Sirisena government in Colombo and the Modi regime in New Delhi, and the former?s willingness to release the boats is an expression of the friendship.

Nelum Pokuna Mw reverts to Ananda Coomaraswamy Mw
	
The Nelum Pokuna Mawatha which abuts the Nelum Pokuna Mahinda Rajapaksa Theatre and stretches between Horton Place Roundabout and the Public Library Roundabout was renamed Ananda Coomaraswamy Mawatha by President Maithripala Sirisena a short while ago.
Earlier known as Ananda Coomaraswamy Mawatha, the road was re-named Nelum Pokuna Mawatha in 2011 to coincide with the opening of the Nelum Pokuna Theatre.
Ananda Kentish Coomaraswamy (1877-1947) was one of the great art historians of the twentieth century whose multifaceted writings deal primarily with visual art, aesthetics, literature and language, folklore, mythology, religion, and metaphysics. His most mature works adeptly expound the perspective of the perennial philosophy by drawing on a detailed knowledge of the arts, crafts, mythologies, cultures, folklores, symbolisms, and religions of both the East and the West.

Lankan accused of molesting 10-year-old disabled girl
	
Dubai Court of First Instance was told that the 29-year-old Sri Lankan sexually abused the Syrian girl then flashed her.
Prosecutors said that, on August 31, 2014, the girl?s dad, also Syrian, left his home in International City in Dubai, with his two daughters, one of whom has been was disabled since birth.
The 35-year-old dad dropped them at a nearby grocery shop and headed to work before receiving a call from his wife informing him that someone had molested his daughter, the court heard.
The daughter testified that she was with her sister, who was pushing the wheelchair and collecting goods, when the man stood beside her and touched her chest.
?I yelled at him and he left,? the wheelchair-bound girl told the court. ?My sister asked me what had happened and I told her that we needed to leave.
?We bought the goods and rushed to our building and I saw him chasing us.?
The man got in the lift with them and went to the second floor while they continued to the third floor, the girl said.
?I was shocked when I saw him in front of the lift,? the young girl said. She added: ?I saw him unzipping his trousers and exposing himself.?
The court heard the twin sister didn?t see him exposing himself but noticed that there was a tattoo on his arm. When the dad arrived, he began searching for the attacker and identified him from the tattoo described by his daughter, it was said at the court.
?He said sorry to me and was looking at my daughter but I called Dubai Police, who came and arrested him,? the Syrian father testified.
The Sri Lankan man denied the charges in court.
The trial has been adjourned until later this month. (7daysindubai)

Commenting on the loss of his parliamentary seat, General Sarath Fonseka today said it should be given back to him in a manner similar to the reinstatement of former Chief Justice Shirani Bandaranayake and was even prepared to go to Court on this matter because President Maithripala Sirisena had cleared him of all ?bogus? allegations.
?The Government decided that the impeachment of Dr. Bandaranayake was null and void and as such should be reinstated in her post. Similarly there are no allegations against me either and my rights, privileges and decorations were restored to me. Therefore, I too must have access to my parliamentary seat. This is how we perceive this issue,? he said.
General Fonseka said MP Jayantha Ketagoda had vowed to relinquish his seat, but was backing out with various reasons though the Elections Commissioner and the Attorney General had informed Mr. Ketagoda that he could resign and make way for him to enter Parliament.
However, he said he would not beg for his parliamentary seat.
?The seat is only valid for a short time. We aren?t asking for the seat to get vehicle permits or other VIP privileges. But our party members will be pleased if we are given back this seat because we too played a role in the victory of this Government,? he said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)Pix by Kushan Pathiraja

Swiss saga! 92 Lankan clients
	
A cache of leaked Swiss bank files analysed by a network of investigative reporters contained information linked to 92 Sri Lankan clients holding 129 accounts with a total value to the tune of approximately US $ 58.3 million (approx. Rs.7.7 billion).
According to International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ), the maximum amount of money associated with a client linked to Sri Lanka was US $ 10.7 million (approx. Rs.1.4 billion) and the country is placed at 112th among the countries with the largest dollar amounts in the leaked Swiss files.
Over 100,000 secret files belonging to HSBC?s Swiss banking arm were leaked in 2007 and were analysed by ICIJ, which enlisted more than 140 journalists from 45 countries in cooperation with France?s Le Monde, Britain?s BBC and The Guardian, US programme 60 Minutes, German newspaper Suddeutsche Zeitung and more than 45 other media organisations.
An ICIJ analysis covering the 1988-2006 period showed the activity levels of accounts linked to Sri Lanka gradually picking up till 1998 and then falling sharply. But in 2006 the activity levels again spiked.
ICIJ also said 88 bank accounts out of the total 129 were opened between 1974 and 2006. It also said about 18 percent of the 92 clients linked to Sri Lanka held Sri Lankan passport or nationality.
Investments by Sri Lankan individuals and companies in Swiss accounts totalled more than 85 million Swiss francs (CHF) in 2011 while the liabilities listed against Sri Lanka were 44 million in the same year, Swiss National Bank (SNB) official data previously had revealed.
Though the names of the Sri Lankan account holders were not disclosed, ICIJ had come up with a global list of 61 profiles that included politicians, businessmen, super models and top sportsmen.
However, ICIJ insisted that offshore accounts were not illegal, though some individuals had taken advantage of the discreet manner the Swiss banks operate to hold undeclared assets and dodge taxes. ?
?HSBC profited from doing business with arms dealers who channelled mortar bombs to child soldiers in Africa, bag men for Third World dictators, traffickers in blood diamonds and other international outlaws,? ICIJ reported.
HSBC in a response acknowledged and admitted the accountability for past compliance and control failures but stressed it had taken significant steps over the past several years to implement reforms and exit clients who did not meet strict new HSBC standards.
HSBC?s Swiss private bank has reduced its client base by almost 70 percent since 2007.
The bank also welcomed the major regulatory reforms currently underway in numerous jurisdictions to ensure that an individual wishing to hide assets from tax authorities will be unable to do so. (Indika Sakalasooriya)

SLFP General Secretary Anura Priyadarshana Yapa and North-Western Province Chief Minister Dayasiri Jayasekara have been questioned by the CID over their involvement in displaying an allegedly fabricated document by former UNP General Secretary Tissa Attanayake.
Police Spokesman Ajith Rohana said statements were recorded from Mr. Yapa, who was also a former Petroleum Minister and Chief Minister Jayasekara last week.
He said the statements were recorded because the two of them were present at a news conference at which former Mr. Attanayake, who is now in remand, had displayed the document.
SSP Rohana said the investigations into this case have been widened because the police believe that many others might have aided and abetted Mr. Attanayake in producing the fabricated document.
He said Mr. Attanayake would also be charged with attempts at creating divisions among communities by projecting a message that former Opposition Leader Ranil Wickremesinghe and then Presidential Candidate Maithripala Sirisena had entered into a secret agreement. (Kevin Kariyawasam)

SriLankan responds to safety concerns and leaked emails
	
	The SriLankan airlines today confirmed it had not found any instances of its Flight crew deactivating flight instruments or systems to simulate abnormal or emergency conditions with passengers on board amid concerns over the airline?s flight safety procedures.
	This matter had been revealed in a leaked official email that referred to possible violations of the Air Navigation Regulations by some of its crew.
	In a statement on this matter, SriLankan airlines while noting that it had maintained an unblemished safety record said the Flight Safety Section of the airline was on constant alert to monitor any deviations of the laid down procedures that could pose a threat.
	?The airline has a Safety Management System that identifies any event that exceeds the pre-set profiles in line with Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) of the airline. The Flight Safety Section monitors these trends on a continuous basis and identifies any deviation that is safety-critical. In this process no such instances of flight crew deactivating certain functional and vital flight instruments/engines/systems on flights (including IRS) with a view to getting an opportunity to practice certain abnormal and emergency conditions had been flagged,? the airlines states.
	However, it noted that on one instance where an inflight turn back was carried out due to suspected engine vibration, an in-depth report of the particular flight?s Digital flight Data Recordings (DFDR) indicated that the flight crew had in fact deviated from the SOPs.
	?After the due inquiry it was found that the flight crew had violated SOPs ? but not the effect of simulating conditions with passengers on board -- appropriate action vis-?-vis the flight crew to address such violations,? the statement noted.
	Concerns over the flight safety of SriLankan airlines emerged when an email written to the Airline CEO Kapila Chandrasena by the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) Director concerning some SriLankan pilots deactivating certain functional and vital flight instruments/engines in flight on SriLankan flights engaged in commercial passenger operations to practice certain abnormal and emergency conditions, was leaked to the media.
	However, a CAA official told Daily Mirror that the email was sent as a precautionary measure as they had received several complaints of such occurrences via their anonymous reporting unit in consideration of the several airline accidents that had occurred in the region.
	?The complaints are yet to be confirmed and the notification was sent only as a precautionary measure and not to put the airline in any position of difficulty. However, the airline management had circulated this email among all its pilots and it has been leaked to the media through one of them,? the official said.
	He said the establishment carries out regular checks on flight crews and operations by selecting random samples but added the anonymous reporting unit was established to receive any safety breaches committed onboard flights, as they are not equipped with necessary manpower to carry out checks on all flights as necessary.
