A brief dialogue that tells a long story!
	
A young dainty fair Diyawanna member of the Colombo District had reportedly created a scene at a key Ministry by berating a security guard on duty there.
?
The fair member who breezed into the Ministry without a prior appointment had inquired from the security guard whether the amethithuma was available.
?I don?t know whether he is in or out. I?ll let you know after making inquiries!? had been the security guard?s reply.
?You don?t know whether amethithuma is in or out??
?That is why I said I had to inquire!?
?A wonderful security karayek you are!?
?Miss, talk in a decent manner!?
?Who are you to teach me how to talk? Do you know who I am???
?I don?t care who you are! Talk in a decent manner!?
?I am ?, a member of ?You will know soon what I can do!? She had left in a huff after issuing this warning, they say.

A good angler quick to see an easy catch!
	
The political sibling who is the livewire of Pohottuwa has set his eye on a Green stalwart, who is said to be nursing a grouse against the party leadership.
?
This local politico registered an easy win at the last local polls and he is said to be unhappy that the party leadership had failed to recognize his showing at the polls in some form.
The unhappy politico had kept away from the occasion of electing the main chair for the council notwithstanding the keen contest expected evidently making way for Pohottuwa to take the council. The political sibling had been sending feelers to him ever since that event, they say.

Age no barrier to carry out mandate: NPC
	
The National Police Commission (NPC) said today the age factor of its members had no bearing whatsoever on fulfilling its mandate.
It said this in response to the recent remarks made by Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe who described the NPC as a home for the aged and that it served no purpose.
The NPC, issuing a statement pointed out that it was detrimental to express an opinion about the performance of the Independent Commission without an objective, evidence-based assessment of its work duly comparing it with its mandate.
?The age factor of the members of the Commission has had no influence whatsoever on the accomplishment of the expected task. In fact, the probability of a decision to be correct, objective and unbiased is high when the decision is taken by a team of seven matured, experienced persons,? it said.
The NPC said the NPC members had been appointed by the Constitutional Council, a body above party politics at the national level under the provisions of the Constitution, which is the basic law of the land.
?The minister himself has been a member of the Council when these appointments were made. As such his statement in a way questions the rationality of the decisions made by the Supreme body,? the NPC said.
It said said the view of minister is that the National Police Commission has become a home for the aged and the tasks expected from the establishment of the Commission were not fulfilled.
?The Commission's mandate as stated in Article 155 of the Constitution is (a) to appoint, transfer, promote and discipline Police Officers and (b) to investigate public complaints against police. The Commission had 155 sessions at which more than 5,000 decisions were taken during the past 3 years relating to these functions. All decisions have been taken by all the 7 members assembling together and after careful consideration of the facts. A Code of Ethics and transfer Policy for police officers, performance evaluation system for officers in charge of Police Stations, a scheme for the increase of women representation in the police are some of the major work of the Commission. Commission has disposed of 4,415 appeals made by the Police Officers including 2,500 appeals carried forward from the past. A large number of delayed promotions of Junior Police Officers expedited. 86% of 4,805 public complaints received by the Commission have been investigated,? the NPC said.
It said a publication with details of Commission's accomplishments during the past three years has been released and would be made available to media shortly.

Cancer Council warning over a popular household product
	
?
Australia, Daily Mail), 8 October 2018 -? Cancer Council Australia has put out a warning over the world?s most popular weedkiller after a multi-million dollar lawsuit linked it to non-Hodgkins lymphoma.??
The nation?s peak cancer body called for an independent review into the particular chemical glyphosate.??
The chemical is the most widely used herbicide on the planet and is popular with farmers in Australia.? ?
It is also an active ingredient of Roundup, which has become a household name.? ?
In Australia alone, more than 500 glyphosate products are sold.??
The World Health Organisation body, the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) labelled glyphosate as ?probably carcinogenic to humans? back in 2015.? ?
?We are concerned that this issue?s not being taken seriously enough in Australia, particularly by the agricultural industry,? Cancer Council Australia CEO Dr Sanchia Aranda told the ABC.??
Dr Chris Parker, Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority (APVMA) said ?Glyphosate remains safe to use in the Australian environment?.? ?
The dismissal came with some scepticism, as concern surrounds the regulator?s independence.??
It is primarily funded by the chemical companies it regulates.??

2015 concessions wouldn't have happened if I was FM: Mangala
	
Finance and Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera said today he would not have given the concessions given in January 2015 if it was he who had been finance minister at that time.
He told a media briefing that in any case he would not disassociate himself with the decision to give concessions by this government of which he was also a minister.
?What we inherited from the previous government's crony capitalist system was a fiscal time bomb,? the minister said and admitted to the fact that most of the MPs had imported vehicles by the time the government had decided to suspend duty-free vehicle permits.
The minister said the government would have to re-visit the need if any for the vehicle permit system any longer. He said by October this year 1.4 million LCs had been opened for the import of vehicles and some 1.6 million vehicles were to be imported.
?At this rate, Sri Lanka no doubt, will experience a vehicle tsunami,? the minister said and added that it was essential for Sri Lanka to adopt an export driven economy and would submit with more proposals to control imports and enhance exports in the wake of the rupee devaluation.
?There are false notions on the rupee devaluation. It would not have been too bad if the country was not affected by a debt burden as it is the case at present,? he said and underscored the fact that the country?s debt servicing would amount to Rs.4 trillion during the next two years.
The minister said the releasing of dollars from our reserves was not an effective solution to devaluation and citing an example he said the rupee was devalued by 14 per cent despite the decision taken by the previous regime to release US$250 million from the reserves.
He said the Indian rupee has devalued more than the Sri Lankan rupee though India had released $40 billion from its reserves.
Moving on to politics, the minister said the report that efforts were being made to form a interim government was a story fabricated and planted by the opposition to scare off investors and pointed out that such a government was a day dream of the 16 SLFP dissidents who had crossed over to the opposition.

Current exchange rate gives real value of LKR
	
- Malik Samarawickrama
There are policy differences between UNP and SLFP
	We have to come to some middle ground, but not at the expense of reforms
	There is a dearth of labourers in industrial sectors
	Need to look at bringing workers from Nepal, Myanmar
	If rupee value stabilizes at 170, it will be satisfactory
?
Development Strategies and International Trade Minister Malik Samarawickrama, in an interview with the Daily Mirror, speaks about the rupee depreciation and the current status of the Government. He also responds to allegations of a powerful Minister trying to seek bribe.?
The Excerpts:
?
Q:What are the plans being contemplated by the Government to tide over the crisis triggered by the fast dwindling rupee value against the US currency?
What I would say is that it is not an economic crisis. We have fundamentals. Currency value depreciation is not confined to Sri Lanka only. All the emerging countries have been affected. In India, it has depreciated by 12-13%. It has happened in Indonesia and the Philippines by eight to nine per cent. Our depreciation is also in that range. Even developed countries like Australia and Turkey have been affected. Turkey?s depreciation is 40%. It is a global issue. Most of the funds from these countries have gone back to the United States. That is the main reason.??
On the other hand, this is also an opportunity for Sri Lankan businessmen and industrialists to take advantage. Now the rupee value is 168/169.This is the correct value for the rupee. Particularly the previous Government defended the rupee and not given it the real value. As a result, our exports have suffered. With the current value of the rupee, our exports will be competitive in the world market. There is a good opportunity to increase our exports. It is important that we become more competitive. We have to increase our productivity.??
QThe Government wanted to free up the exchange control. Also, it wanted to liberalize the economy more and more to the world. What do you think of these policies in retrospect?
Those policies are correct. You cannot have a protectionist policy. No country has developed by having such a policy. The former communist regimes such as Vietnam, Cambodia and even China have opened up now. They are now saying that the countries must liberalize. They have liberalized their trade policies. That is why they are reaping the benefits. Vietnam has not been that affected by the currency crisis. They have a huge export volume. It amounts to US$ 240 billion.??
?
The Finance Ministry has taken some short tere measures. We have to ensure that at least for a period of time, we must refrain from importing luxury goods
QHow do you look at liberalization in a context of the local currency depreciating?
The rupee has got the real value now. Earlier, it was easy for people to import. People imported goods. Now the value is high. Therefore, there is an opportunity for people to produce locally. It is better to produce goods here. If it was worth the US $ 100 at that time, it would be Rs.14,000 locally. Now, it is Rs.17,000 locally. Economic decisions have to be taken on the long-term interests of the country, but not on how to win elections next time.??
QDoes it mean that further depreciation of rupee would be beneficial in that sense?
I am not saying that. It has a limit. Now, at least, the local industries can come up.??
QWhat is the most advisable currency exchange rate in your view?
The current rate is the right value. It will be good if it stabilizes around 170/180.
QWhat is the government?s policy on the development of local industries?
We have to go through with the reforms even to improve the efficiency of the local industries. That trade facilitation is absolutely important. We must also encourage people to bring raw materials. Every local industry must gear itself to export. Ours is a small market. With protectionist measures, we will not be competitive. Then, even our consumers have to buy our goods at higher prices.??
In the new export strategy, we have identified new products. Our production base has been very low. It is a traditional base. We have identified electronics and electrical items, automobile spare parts, wellness tourism, boat building, IT-related services, rubber based products etc.?
?QWhat are the measures being taken to overcome the crisis?
I think the Finance Ministry has taken some short term measures. We have to ensure that, at least for a period of time, we must refrain from importing luxury goods.??
QWould there be further restrictions?
I do not think. Most of the funds have been spent on importing gold, vehicles and other luxury items. By restricting the imports on these, it is not going to affect the poorer section of society. This will obviously affect the middle class for a while.??
QOtherwise, are you contemplating some measures such as the currency swap agreements with respective countries?
I think the Central Bank is doing something. It is going to issue Panda Bonds. CB Governor Dr. Indrajith Coomaraswamy indicated how he is going to raise US $ 1 billion or so. The reserves have dropped to US $ 7.5 billion. The governor said it would increase to US $ 8.3 billion by the end of this year with money coming in.??
QThe previous Government has signed a currency swap agreement with China to transact in Renminbi instead of US currency. What is your view?
We are also encouraging it. There is no issue.??
QHow are you planning to proceed with the reform policy of the Government under the current circumstances?
Fiscal policy reforms have been done. Monetary policy reforms have been done. Therefore, we say fundamentals are in place. We are going through the trade policy reforms. There is no alternative but to go through these reforms. We look at some labour reforms as well. We have to reform the labour laws.??
QWhy do you say so?
Our labour laws are archaic.??
QWhat are the kinds of reforms which are intended to be done?
We have to give some sort of flexibility for people to be employed and discontinued. There should be a less costly exit mechanism. Suppose that you have 1000 persons employed and the industry is having some issues! If you reduce it by another 200 people, the industry can survive and do even better. But, it costs too much to remove these 200 people. Those are issues we have to look at. Also, we have to look at the working hours, particularly for females. It should be brought on par with the males. Some laws prevent females from working at night. We have to look at all that. That is, particularly in the IT related services. We have to take examples from some of our neighbouring countries such as Thailand, Malaysia and even Vietnam.??
In Vietnam, there are 7000 Japanese firms over there. They have established factories over there. I think there are similar amounts of companies from South Korea as well. They have opened up their economy.??
?
In India, it has depreciated by 12-13%. It has happened in Indonesia and the Philippines by 8-9%. Our depreciation is also in that range. Even developed countries like Australia and Turkey have been affected
QDo you see Vietnam as a role model country for Sri Lanka?
I think Thailand and Vietnam should be role model countries.??
QIn Sri Lanka, there is a dearth of workers in some sectors. How are you going to address it?
There is a dearth in construction and other industries. We have to address it in the industrial, plantation and construction sectors.??
QHow are you going to address it?
We have to look at giving work permit for a limited period. Unless this problem is addressed, these companies cannot grow. In fact, they cannot even sustain there. Most of them are working under capacity. Even the plantation sector is having issues now. They find it difficult to bring workers. They have to look at automation. Yet, there is a limit to what you can do through automation in the plantation sector.??
QAre you looking at labour markets elsewhere in the neighbourhood for it?
We have to look whether we can have people from Myanmar and Nepal. We have to see whether we can bring them. These are the things the responsible governments have to look at. You cannot ignore them for political reasons.??
QFor all that to happen, political stability is needed. It is said that there are two centres of power in the government. We value your comments on this...
There are no two centres. We are working very closely. Of course, there are differences in policies between the UNP and the SLFP. We are trying to work as far as possible.??
QHow difficult would it be to reconcile these differences?
We have to come to some middle ground and go ahead, but not at the expense of reforms.??
QHow about your experience during the last three years?
The biggest problem is the mindset. You have to change the mindset of the politicians, of bureaucrats and of people. We have to realize that we cannot go ahead with the way we have done before. If you look at these neighbouring countries, they were so far behind us. Right now, they are so far ahead of us in every aspect. It is really frightening.??
QWhat do you think of stability of the government?
I think we are a very stable government. There is no issue.??
QSome people say it is fragile. What do you feel?
It is generally a fake news from the media; particularly the social media.??
QAnyway, how it had affected the investor confidence?
Investors are looking at reforms. They are looking at Sri Lanka now. We have neglected the investors, particularly from the west for a long period of time. We have to restart the whole process.??
QHow feasible is it to attract investors from the west?
There are still some investors looking at investing in countries like ours. Some of them have invested in all these countries - Vietnam and Thailand. At the same time, we also feel that we should look at India, China, South Korea, Japan and so on.??
QRecently, there were reports that a powerful minister and a State Minister tried to solicit a bribe from an investor. The reports said that this investor complained to the President. Doesn?t it erode investor confidence?
They were all bogus, false allegations surface from time to time. If anybody has done that, he should be removed from the Cabinet. There are various allegations made by people who are frustrated. They cannot get their jobs done through various deals. The Government is not encouraging it. We do not want deal makers.??
QWhat do you think of this bribe-seeking allegation involving an electric rail project?
That is totally untrue. I have not even met or spoken to them neither seen the colour of them. I got a report from the Board of Investment (BoI). I just want to know what was going on. They will have a press conference and expose.??
According to them, Some Sri Lankans residing in Italy have formed a company in Sri Lanka in 2012. They have come up with a proposal that they can produce electric rail coaches.?
The value of exports they have given was US $ 5 billion. It is 40% of the total exports of the country. They have requested for 4000 acres of land. Of course, they have not given a business plan. Nor, have they given who their buyers were. On top of this, they said they wanted to import 2000 vehicles and four helicopters. They want to open a bank. They want to have a hospital and to have a hotel. From that itself, you can see whether this is a valid proposal or not.??
?
Investors are looking at reforms. They are looking at Sri Lanka now. We have neglected the investors, particularly from the west for a long period of time. We have to restart the whole process
QAlso, there is another allegation that the Central Bank has frozen the account of a Minister. What is your response?
If that is the case, you must expose who the person is. We do not encourage people to do these kinds of things. If the Central Bank has found something, it must be exposed.??
QWhat is the current status of the Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with Singapore?
It is proceeding. There is no issue on it. There is a committee appointed by the President. If the committee points out that any clause is harmful to the country, certainly we can discuss it with Singapore.
QWhat do you think of this committee appointed by the President to review it?
Let them come out with their report! We are open to their suggestions. If there is anything harmful, we can renegotiate it. There is a revision provision for it.??
QHow far have your progress regarding the Economic and Technology Cooperation Agreement (ETCA) with India?
We are having the 11th round of talks. Good progress has been made. Within the first quarter of next year, we will be able to complete negotiations. Then, we have to discuss with the Cabinet and proceed.???

?Demons in Paradise? Is Jaffna ready for full scope of freedom  ?
	
?
Jaffna International Film Festival that began last week has removed Jude Ratnam?s internationally acclaimed ?Demons in Paradise? from screening. The decision to remove the film - that depicts the gradual but predictable degeneration of Tamil militancy into one of cannibalizing its own- was treated with a muted reaction in the South. In the North, save a few genuine, and time tested activists of the calibre of Rajan Hoole, the majority tended to justify the censorship of the movie.? ?
Silence of the civil society activists in the South may be due to the popular fallacy that some people and communities (and not others) ought to have safe spaces and trigger warnings. This notion has been cited by leftist student activists in American universities to justify the shutting off from universities, the opposing voices of populist and nationalist types. In Europe, same idea led the Islamic activists to demand safe space to discuss things ranging from martyrdom to Burkas away from the scrutiny of public security agencies.??
Jude Ratnam?s movie is uncomfortable for Jaffna?s LTTE rump and fringe Tamil nationalists for it challenges the received wisdom of the LTTE. The movie by the Tamil filmmaker first empathizes with the Tamil militancy, portraying it as a reaction to the suppression by the Sinhalese-led Colombo centric state. However, as the militancy unfolds, romance turns sour in an orgy of internecine violence, unleashed predominantly by the LTTE on the other groups.??
Jaffna?s Tamil nationalists cannot stomach this bitter reality. Organizers removed the movie from screening allegedly due to the pressure from a group only known as ? community.???
?
Jaffna?s Tamil nationalists cannot stomach this bitter reality. Organizers removed the movie from screening allegedly due to the pressure from a group only known as ? community?
That is sad. However in many ways, that is quite understandable too. Jaffna was never a bastion of freedom expression, even before the emergence of the militancy it suppressed alternative views that promoted a less confrontational approach towards Colombo. Nor is it now- it is suppressed both by the state?s security apparatus and an exclusivist Tamil nationalist thought.? ?
Neither would it become free anytime in the immediate future. There are multiple mutually -reinforcing forces of political contrast that hamstrung Jaffna?s emergence as a free society.? ?
Jaffna?s opinion elites have gradually but unmistakably restored a culture that glorified Tamil militancy and nihilistic terrorism of the LTTE. Same folks who are disturbed by Jude Ratnam?s portrayal of the LTTE are commemorating the Black Tigers in July,Mahaveerar Week in November and another so-called genocide day in May. The LTTE nurtured and harnessed its culture of martyrdom through the same set of ritualistic commemorations.??
There is a second element which explains why this culture of fringe nationalism is likely to prevail: because, it suppresses all other rival, saner ideologies. After all that is how Jaffna succumbed to its current plight. A contemporary example would be students? politics at our public universities. Even after being ruthlessly suppressed by two counter insurgency operations, this psudo-leftist tinted insular ideology of the JVP and its breakaway group has reestablished itself as the dominant force in the university politics. It has achieved that feat by exploiting the permissive atmosphere in the universities and passive university administrators who turned a blind eye to its violent maximizing approach.??
Its success in our universities is not because university students are a uniformed lot who have special grievances which others don?t. Instead, student activists of this myopic ideology have recreated a parallel universe where all these feigned grievances are floated, and trap the na?ve and hapless majority within it.??
LTTE-loving Eelam apologists are also doing the same in Jaffna. They suppress other opinions and fill the vacuum with their bitterness.? ?
Third, politicians in both the South and the North have always found it easier to appease the hardline than to confront it. Vijayakala Maheswaran MP called for the revival of the LTTE to fight crime in Jaffna. Most those allegations of high rate of crime and rape (as she implied) are also exaggerated and intended to provide an immediate pretext to delegitimize the central government.??
Fourth, dynamism of those forces is bound to trigger a government response that would take back some of the civic freedoms and tighten the grip. (Maheswaran herself was arrested yesterday by the police over her remarks). The government?s response, though can be justified in the need to keep a tab on separatist sentiments, also make the Northern Tamils feel suppressed. These grievances can also fuel nationalism and play into the hands of the extreme Tamil nationalists.? ?
On the other hand, if you allow a free scope of activism, there is no guarantee, its degeneration would culminate in another bus bomb in the South ? or a Catalonia-styled mayhem, and then to an armed struggle.??
?
LTTE-loving Eelam apologists are also doing the same in Jaffna. They suppress other opinions and fill the vacuum with their bitterness
Fifth, assume that Jaffna?s ?community? would open itself up to all shades of opinion, and is prepared for a civilized debate of all matters. That would cause a tricky situation. Those who oppose the removal of ?Demons in Paradise? as an assault of free speech, would also have to be ready to allow the screening of Channel 4?s ?Sri Lanka killing fields?, no matter how concocted claims are in the documentary. That however offers a tough choice for the government. Nationalist outburst in the South over such a screening would not be nice. Therefore, effectively shutting Jaffna from a diverse spread of opinion, fringe nationalists have made it easier for the Sri Lankan government, at least in the short run to maintain the status quo.? ?
However, such conditions do not help the country in the long run. This brings to the final scenario. Post-conflict transition, including civil liberties, should be managed in an incremental manner. That would also mean, while according more freedom and space, the government should also nudge Jaffna?s opinion makers towards a more conciliatory line. At the same time, red lines of the discourse should also be clearly visible. Crossing that should be met with retributive cost, not in the form of white vans, but through the legal arm of the state.??
Until that time, Jaffna blocking out of ?Demons in Paradise? is Jaffna?s business.? ?

Divided Brazil barrels towards uncertain presidential run-off
	
?
RIO AFP JANEIRO, Oct8, 2018-A deeply polarized Brazil stood at a political crossroads Monday as the bruising first round of the presidential election left voters with a stark choice in the run-off between far-right firebrand Jair Bolsonaro and leftist Fernando Haddad.?
?
Bolsonaro, an ultraconservative former paratrooper, easily beat a dozen other candidates on Sunday, but not by enough to avoid an October 28 showdown with Haddad, the former mayor of Sao Paulo.? ?
Bolsonaro won 46 percent of the vote to Haddad?s 29 percent, according to official results.? ?
That tracked closely with pollster?s predictions, but Bolsonaro charged that ?polling problems? had cheated him of outright victory in the first round, which required him to pass the 50 percent threshold.? ?
Surveys suggest Bolsonaro will have the edge, but that Haddad will draw nearly even with him after picking up substantial support from the defeated candidates.?

Do not politicize the rupee
	
?
?
Sri Lanka Rupee had its sharpest depreciation in history during the past four months with US$ which stood at Rs.160 in late June had risen up to Rs.170 last week. The government is struggling to cope with the situation. Yet it is now clear that the situation is beyond control and no solution is being suggested either by the government or any other political party that criticizes the government for not taking action to reign in the galloping rupee.? ?
The neck-breaking pace of rupee depreciation has become the subject matter these days for almost all political parties including the main party in the ruling coalition, the United National Party (UNP), in their blame game. The Joint Opposition/ Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) led by former President Mahinda Rajapaksa is claiming that the government?s fiscal management policies were responsible for the current situation. They do not see the depreciation trend in other countries, especially in Asian countries. In turn, the leaders of the government, especially the UNP attribute the drop in the Sri Lankan currency to the huge amount of loans obtained by the previous Rajapaksa government, apart from the withdrawals of investments from Sri Lanka as a result of the rise in the interest rates in the US.? ?
The Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) in its part also attempts to capitalize from the situation by accusing the two main political parties that governed the country since Independence for not building an export-oriented economy. Despite it being true, the JVP leaders also do not suggest any short-term policy or strategy for the country to bolster the plummeting rupee for the moment. The Joint Opposition/SLPP are the harshest critics of the government in this regard and the group that aspire to capture power at the next national level elections has also failed to tell the country as to how they would stabilize the Sri Lankan currency once they came to power.? ?
The UNP while criticizing the previous regime for the situation is pointing finger at the leader of its coalition partner President Maithripala Sirisena as well by holding the National Economic Council that was established by the latter recently replacing a committee that was headed by its leader, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe. The Premier in the meantime suggests transforming the country?s economy into an export-oriented one soon to avert a crisis situation. Despite him being theoretically correct a mere suggestion to increase the exports immediately without specific measures would not serve the purpose.? ?
As the media and the Opposition parties always suggest the rupee has been ?hitting the record low? for the past several decades. In 1978, when the open economy was introduced with the rupee being floated against the dollar, the US currency jumped from Rs. 8 to Rs.16. It was a record then and the rupee continued to ?hit a record low.?? ?
Any students in economics would know that the only remedy for the local currency depreciation is increasing exports or/and minimizing imports. Only an increase in the local production of goods and services would increase exports or/and reduce imports. This is basic knowledge in economics. One cannot deny the importance of fiscal management, but it would help only in the short run.? ?
We have an export-oriented plantation sector since mid-nineteenth century and it was the main revenue for the country sometime back, even after the Independence. However, with the increase in the population and its varying needs, the stagnating plantation economy became insignificant. No government after Independence worked towards the increase or diversification of exports in a large scale except for the regime headed by President J. R. Jayewardene which during its initial years introduced the open economy with free trade zones (FTZ) being set up. During the same time, labour market was opened for Sri Lankans, especially for housemaids in the Middle East countries, bringing much-needed dollars into the country.? ?
The foreign investments and the local industries in the later years were far below the country?s foreign exchange needs, and this sends the dollar always upwards and the rupee ?hits always record low.? And now, without looking at the problem objectively, the politicians are attempting to take political mileage.? ? ?

	This shows the tendency to see ragging in isolation from other problems
?
Ragging of freshers is an ordinary occurrence in Sri Lankan State universities. However, the tragic incidents that we hear of or read on newspapers are far from what ordinary youth must endure in their institute providing higher education. Nevertheless, like many other blatantly irrational aspects of our society, despite all measures that have been purportedly taken so far, nothing seems to have curbed the strong-willed mindset of those who engage in ragging. While the majority is brainwashed to continue with the viscous cycle, some drop out, some fall ill and some even commit suicide.? ?
A 23-year-old undergraduate of the Sabaragamuwa University committed suicide after suffering mental trauma because she underwent severe ragging in 2015. There were recent reports of six fresher Buddhist monks being stripped naked and subjected to disreputable forms of ragging by a few senior undergraduate monks. Another poignant incident which left the public dismayed was the brutal ragging of freshers at the University of Peradeniya in an isolated house by 15 second-year undergraduates. An unprecedented number of cases, associated with undergraduates who enter universities with aspirations to build their lives, feature incidents of them being abused mentally, physically and sexually. But these victims refrain from reporting these incidents due to their lack of faith in how the country enforces justice.? ?
By now, after many records of traumatic and unimaginable acts of ragging and displeasure expressed by many in response, people are aware that ragging is an offence and is prohibited under the Prohibition of Ragging and Other Forms of Violence in Educational Institutions Act No. 19 of 1998 (Ragging Act). Ragging can also be tantamount to torture and thereby a violation of the fundamental right; which provides for an individual to be free from torture and cruel and degrading treatment. This right is protected by the Constitution, warranting the invocation of the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court. Insofar as ragging takes the form of sexual harassment, penal provisions can be invoked.? ?
If the Ragging Act is a failure and the prevailing legal framework is insufficient to eradicate this menace, does the solution lie in legislative amendment and criminalising of ragging?? ?
Standing up for their rights
Ragging is a criminal offence with rigorous punishment under the Ragging Act which was passed 20 years ago. The problem was that it was not implemented for a long time and many students were ragged

Dr. Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe, Minister of Higher Education & Cultural Affairs airing his views on ragging said,?Ragging is a criminal offence with rigorous punishment under the Ragging Act which was passed 20 years ago. The problem was that it was not implemented for a long time and as a result many students who were ragged did not come up and complain to the relevant authorities. Now, the act is well implemented and mechanisms are in place. We have conducted many awareness?

We have conducted many awareness programmes for both undergraduates and parents to advise students against engaging in ragging
?
programmes for both undergraduates and parents to advise students against engaging in ragging. We have also used media as a tool to reach out to people and make them aware of the legal actions that can be taken. As a result there are many students who step up and report on abusive activities they were subject to by their seniors and we see a big difference in them standing up for their rights. Currently there are about 50, 60 undergraduates who are in remand prison after being accused of ragging. Justice will be served?.
Having inquired about whether the available legal framework is sufficient to stop ragging at universities, the Minister answered in the affirmative. ?With an Act and mechanisms to implement it in place, the law that?s available is adequate to fight ragging. The Rule of Law must be upheld. We cannot allow students to suffer. What happens under the guise of ?ragging? is torture and sexual harassment. Now it is up to the victims and the general public to make use of the laws and corporate to stop these crimes,? he added.?
?
Greed for power?
Ragging in any form should not take place in any institution. There is nothing called mild ragging or good ragging. Ragging does not start at Universities, it happens at schools
?
?
?
Prof Chandrika Jayasinghe, Professor in Medicine, Consultant Physician, Faculty of Medicine, Peradeniya and the author of the book ? ?Ragging in Higher Educational Institutions? said that ragging is a national disaster.?
?Ragging in any form should not take place in any institution. There is nothing called mild ragging or good ragging. Ragging does not start at Universities, it happens at schools, mainly at the hands of prefects. The main reason for the existence and continuation of ragging in any educational institute is the greediness for power. The opportunity to exert power over equals which they would not have done under normal conditions is therefore seized,?Prof. Jayasinghe explained.?
In addition, Prof. Jayasinghe underscored several reasons for ragging to take place which are; the idea that it is tradition, the notion of fun, fear of exclusion as it is done by the majority, jealousy, ?returning the rag?, intentions of forming ?cliques? and finding girlfriends.? ?
?Jealousy is the basis of the dress code during rag season. There is an incorrect notion that most individuals who engage in ragging come from less affluent families. This is wrong. More than poverty, wrong upbringing, a callous home atmosphere and insensitive parents are the usual background of those engaging in ragging.? she went on.?
Referring to brutal physical acts of ragging, Prof Jayasinghe stated that sexual acts such as stripping freshmen naked and forcing them to engage in sexual or obscene acts- although classified as sex education- will lead to a nation that possesses sexual perverts. ?These acts happen again due to the greed to exert power combined with deranged mindsets due to not receiving love at their own homes and being harassed when they were young. Inferiority complexes, low self-esteem, general rage against the human race and derivation of sadistic sexual pleasures are also reasons behind these kind of acts,? opined Prof. Jayasinghe.?
Speaking of medical complications, Prof. Jayasinghe said that stress, post-traumatic stress, anxiety, phobias and long standing depression can result from ragging. She assumes that Amali Chathurika, the student of Sabaragamuwa University, who committed suicide, must have suffered from these conditions. Among other health impacts are lasting personality disorders, Haemolysis (destruction of red blood cells), Rhabdomyolysis (destruction of muscle cells) and renal failure which can lead to death (cause of death of Selva Vinayagar Varaprakash, student of University of Peradeniya), anxiety, panic attacks and trauma.? ?
?When freshers enter universities they are already in a compromised and vulnerable position as their medical status, including mental strength, is not known to fellow students and the staff. Harassing them further can easily dislodge them from their balance and cause heavy impacts,? she warned.? ?

More than poverty, wrong upbringing, a callous home atmosphere and insensitive parents are the usual background of those engaging in ragging
?
Asked about what measures could be taken to eradicate ragging, Prof. Jayasinghe strongly insisted that as a first step, academic and non-academic staff members should be committed to wipe out ragging. ?If there is a zero tolerance policy for ragging, there has to be genuine adherence to zero tolerance. Students who report of ragging must be protected from those who engage in ragging without isolating them. The university system has failed to understand that the degree of sensitivity and tolerance varies from person to person. An act which is mild for one can be a harsh experience for another depending on their sensitivity. When some in the university staff do not encourage reporting ?minor? incidents, new students lose confidence in the reporting system.?
?Any framework put in place must include senior students. Through soft skills and mental health leadership programmes, we can curb insecure feelings of those who engage in ragging. We need to have better discussions with students rather than blame and condemn them. Educating freshers and their parents that they have a right to be free of ragging is necessary. The message that they needn?t waste their time satisfying putrid demands and requests of those who engage in ragging, but can enjoy university life and gain the maximum out of it should be conveyed out to them. Technology must be used to bring freshers together before they can be infiltrated by those who engage in ragging. The country?s law must prevail in the universities too, especially when these acts are exposing somebody?s mental, physical health and life to risk,? she said.?
?
Freshers need help at a new place?
?
Ragging is the result of a complex set of factors and divisions in our society. It is fed by a desire for dominance and a desire for unity and a sense of family
?
?
?
Sanjayan Rajasingham, a former Lecturer of Law at the University of Jaffna and currently engaged in post graduate studies, said that critics can?t take a one-dimensional view of ragging as done by ?barbaric? or ?insecure? seniors with the intention of protecting themselves. ?Ragging is the result of a complex set of factors and divisions in our society. It is fed by a desire for dominance, a desire for unity and a sense of family, a demand for equalisation across social, ethnic and religious backgrounds and a need for socialisation. This is because the core of ragging is the idea that force is essential to reach these goals. Moreover, ragging is also part of a much larger set of problems freshers face at university. They need help in a new?
?
I do not think university administrators or staff can be neutral on ragging. We need to be proactive in responding to it. Universities are meant to be places where students are taught to think critically and creatively
?
place. They need help transitioning from school rote-learning to critical thinking. They need money for food, a good place to stay, and other day-to-day things. Seniors come in to fill these needs, but often have ragging as the condition for their help. We need to think about how we respond to this.? opined Rajasingham.?
Asked about whether the university staff is justified in taking a neutral stance in relation to ragging with the university, Rajasingham answered in the negative. ?I do not think university administrators or staff can be neutral on ragging. We need to be proactive in responding to it. Universities are meant to be places where students are taught to think critically and creatively about life, society and themselves. Yet in ragging we find a process that teaches them, right from the start, to be obedient and subordinate to a certain group (in this case seniors). I think this is one reason that our students are not formed into critical citizens as much as we would like. Some even support ragging. Some of them say that they had it worse when they were in university, or that it is only for a couple of months and so isn?t worth being bothered about. This is outrageous. There are also administration and staff who actively struggle against it. However this can also be problematic so far as their position and power are used to dominate and control students. I often found it tempting to use my position to control students when I was a lecturer. But ifI did that, why should I be surprised if seniors use their power to dominate and control juniors? Ultimately, they learn things from us based on how we act,? added Rajasingham.?
Speaking of university subculture, he stated that it is merely a tool used to justify acts of ragging. ?Subculture can mean harmless things like wasting time all day at the canteen - or??
?
?I do not think university administrators or staff can be neutral on ragging. We need to be proactive in responding to it. Universities are meant to be places where students are taught to think critically and creatively about life, society and themselves
?
it can be deeply harmful things like violent, sexually abusive ragging. Yet I think this issue of subculture takes us to a broader question which is, are there meaningful justifications for ragging.
?While the legal framework and other additional things like confidentiality complaints are positive steps, all of them only respond to ragging after it takes place. This shows the tendency to see ragging in isolation from other problems students face. We need holistic solutions which address the root causes of ragging. I think the staffers need to get on the ground, speak to student leaders and first years and understand them. Why do they rag? What are the factors that convince so many of them (even first years) that this is a good thing? And most importantly, are there alternative ways of achieving some of the aims of ragging? The reason ragging persists is because there is no viable alternative offered to help orient students; support them when they are struggling as a new person at university; and build a community. Thankfully I have seen some students take the initiative regarding this, and there was a fairly successful attempt at an alternative conducted at Jaffna University?s Law Department last year,? he said.?
?
Solution possible through discussion?
?
Whatever practices that are conducted within universities are influenced very much by what is happening outside; by the social, economic and political changes that take place in society
?
Lahiru Weerasekara,? Convener of Inter University Students? Federation said thatseniors do not deny that there are regressive practices like cruelty and violence at universities. ?However, it is not fair to view them in isolation and point fingers at the IUSF, Student Unions or Leftist parties as supportive of these acts. Whatever practices that are conducted within universities are influenced very much by what is happening outside; by the social, economic and political changes that take place in society. There is no point in passing laws to control or change this situation. The Ragging Act was brought essentially for the eradication of university students. It is a solution imposed by outsiders and cannot ever be a viable answer to the issue. Since these alleged practices have been conducted for generations, it is through discussions within universities between student groups and university staff that a solution can be arrived at. We are in the process of conducting such discussions,? said Weerasekara.?
?
?
New app to stop ragging?
In collaboration with the Sri Lanka Information and Communication Technology Agency, the University Grants Commission has launched a new Emergency Safety Mobile App to report acts of ragging conveniently. According to Minister Rajapakshe, it is only operating within the Uva-Wellassa University presently, but will be introduced to other universities in the near future. The minister was unaware of whether the app had been successful, but assured that there is a separate unit and an officer-in-charge and also a hotline for students to reach the authorities.?
?
Vineshka Mendis
(23), Faculty of Law at the University of Colombo said thatalthough it is a good step that has been introduced to get every university entrant to certify, prior to entrance, that he or she will not engage in ragging, it would be of no real effect if complaints made by victims of ragging are subjected to ragging once they start university education. Mendis said that complaints fall on deaf ears or victims suffer due to the slow process of justice present.? ?
?The burden of eradicating ragging is not only on the students, but also on the administration. It is of no real effect if the administration is not vocal and active about its zero tolerance of ragging. In such an environment the students will not be convinced that the laws in place are affording them any real protection,? said Mendis.?
Yashika Herath
(23), Faculty of Management, University of Jayawardhanapura said that ragging should continue at universities to a certain extent because it is during the ragging period that freshers get to know each other and build up strong bonds with eachs. But there must also be some control over extreme acts of ragging. The prevailing rules are of course useless; what need to be changed are the attitudes of people. Strict rules must nevertheless be brought in to stop extreme acts of ragging.? ?

Maga Neguma welfare society funded Rs.20 mn for Hirunika?s political activities: FCID
	
It was reported before the Colombo Chief Magistrate Ranga Dissanayake today, that a sum amounting to Rs. 20 million had been spent through an account belonging to the Welfare Society of the Maga Neguma Construction Equipment company to fund the political activities of Hirunika Premachandra who is currently a member of Parliament.
The OIC of the FCID unit 07 Chief Police Inspector Anura Premarathne submitted to courts the above facts as per a complaint lodged on 20th March, by the Chief Internal Auditor of the Peliyagoda Maga Neguma Construction Equipment Company Maragala Mudiyanselage Sarath Kumara.
The FCID had reported to courts that the IGP had handed over this matter to the FCID for the conduct of an investigation. It had been further stated that the Welfare Society had been established in 2007.
In terms of the institution of this Welfare Society a sum of Rs. 100 had been recovered from its members as membership fees, and from 2017 this membership fee had been increased to Rs. 150, which is been continued at present.
The report states further that the former Chairman of the Maga Neguma Construction Equipment Company Kingsley Ranawake had on 28th December 2012 presented a Board Paper to increase the Non-refundable amount of 0.1% from the value of the contract recovered from the sub contractors and in addition to this 0.1% another 0.2% to be recovered from them.
The FCID in its report further states that he has obtained the board approval for the above increase and additional charges. The report also states that in 2013 a General Meeting of the Maga Neguma institute had been held and an Auditor had been appointed to the Welfare Society. Audits had been conducted for the balance six months of the year 2012 and annual audits for the years 2013 and 2014 conducted.
From these audits, it has transpired that in 2013 Rs 1,217,750.00, and in 2014 a sum of Rs 17,647,179.67 from the funds of the Employees Welfare Society had been obtained in violation of the constitution of the Society, and the amounts paid to Hirunika Premachandra and Lanka Phosphate Company had been supported by bills as reported to courts. In addition to the funds provided as proved by bills, the expenditure of additional amounts are not supported by bills which could be subjected to audit.
Accordingly, the FCID reported that the audit officer had mentioned in his report that the Committee of Patrons, the Chairman and the Treasurer should be held responsible for the welfare activities, and the reports of 2013 and 2014 years clearly indicates that a sum of Rs 18,864,929.67 from the account of the Welfare Society had been used for political and other activities.

Maldivian Elections  Between rock and hard place
	
?
Maldivian Elections Commissioner and four Commissioners find themselves between a rock and a hard place
	The situation in the Maldives is messy
	Yameen accuses EC of having rigged it in the Opposition?s favour by taking money
?
?
The Maldivian Elections Commissioner Ahmed Shareef and his four Commissioners, find themselves in the unenviable position of being between a rock and a hard place.??
On the one hand, they are hounded by incumbent PresidentAbdulla Yameen, who was resoundingly defeated by the coalition candidate, Ibrahim Mohamed Solih, in the September 23 Presidential election.?
On theother hand, they are disregarded, if not despised, by the Joint Opposition for having been a lackey of Yameen.??
Yameen, who had initially accepted the result gracefully and declared that he would hand over power to Solih on November 17 (when his term ends officially) suddenly made an about turn and declared that the election was rigged.??
He accused the Elections Commission headed by Ahmed Shareef of having rigged it in the opposition?s favour by taking money from it.
Yameen?s Progressive Party of the Maldives (PPM) charged that the September 23 election was the most disorganized one yet, and that Shareef had used some ingenious methods to nullify votes cast in Yameen?s favour.??
The PPM claimed pointed out to a social media audio clip doing the rounds which had Shareef talking to an unidentified person about the rigging process and assuring him that he would not be arrested.??
However, Shareef, has denied the charges, describing them as baseless and preposterous.? ?
The entire process of voting and counting had taken place in front of international observers, who had declared the election as free and fair, he told this writer in a telephone conversation.??
As for the charge of taking a bribe from the Joint Opposition, he said that he denied that he had the bank account into which the money was allegedly deposited.??
According to another Commissioner, Yameen did not expect to lose the elections ?Although the ground situation was far from favourable for him.???
The Commissioner said:? ?
?Yameen believed the Yes Men surrounding him who gave him a rosy picture. He never did any field study to test what was told to him. Shocked by the result he started suspecting foul play by the Elections Commission at the behest of the opposition.???
Yameen not only got the PPM to level serious charges against Shareef but allegedly sent goons to harass the families of the commissioners.?
At first, two of the commissioners fled the country fearing arrest and soon all, except Shareef, fled. Fear of arrest was heightened after Shareef sacked the Police Chief and appointed a more pliant one.??
Opposition Neutral
However, the Opposition has not rushed to Shareef?s rescue as they too had made serious charges against him during the election campaign.??
According to Maldivian Democratic Party (MDP) Spokesman, Hamid Abdul Ghafoor, the Opposition believes that it won the election despite the machinations of Shareef and his team who were allegedly paid by Yameen to rig the poll in his favour.??
According to Maldives Independent Shareef was hand-picked by the President and endorsed by the ruling PPM at a Parliament sitting boycotted by the Opposition.? ?
Shareef had been Secretary General of Yameen?s PPM and was therefore a highly trusted follower.??
Upon his nomination, the spokesman of the main Opposition MDP, Imthiyaz Fahmy, had said: ?We have no trust in his independence.???
Maldives Independent further reported:? ?
?Shareef?s Twitter page was enough to question his neutrality. As the head of the State Utility Fenaka Corporation, Shareef championed Yameen and worked in his re-election campaign, calling the President a hero while taunting the opposition.??
?
Shareef had further said:? ?
?The Opposition knows they don?t have a slightest chance of winning an independent election against HEP Yameen because of his transformational economic agenda. The only way to achieve their selfish goals coming to power is to attempt a coup, using money they owe to the people.???
This was in a tweet a month before his appointment to the independent electoral watchdog.??
?Ahead of last year?s municipal elections, Shareef was caught on video promising jobs for Opposition candidates if they withdrew their candidacies. Citing his partisan background, the opposition alleged collusion and suspected Shareef would fix the election,? Maldives Independence reported.??
?
We went on door-to-door canvassing and used all social networks to reach the grassroots. We were crunching numbers on a daily basis
Opposition?s Strategy To Counter Rigging
Expecting the poll to be rigged by Shareef and the Elections Commission (EC), the Joint Opposition worked doubly hard to win the poll in such a way that rigging would not be easy, MDP Spokesman Ghafoor told this writer.??
?We went on door-to-door canvassing and used all social networks to reach the grassroots. We were crunching numbers on a daily basis, while Yameen was sitting pretty, over confident about the system being geared to his needs and that his economic achievements would win him a clear majority.?
?We got a little over 58% of the valid votes and the election could not be rigged. In other words, Shareef could not carry out the job given to him by Yameen. People had come in their thousands to vote. If they were registered in far flung areas with a design to discourage them from voting, they went to those places to exercise their franchise. Polling time had to be extended to allow the assembled to vote,? Ghafoor pointed out.??
Shareef Becomes Fall Guy
A shocked Yameen turned his guns against Shareef.? ?
?Shareef was made the fall guy. Yameen suspected him of taking money from the Joint Opposition to rig the election in the latter?s favour,? Ghafoor said. Shareef is now ?between a rock and a hard place,? the MDP Spokseman said.? ?
Neither Yameen nor Solih trusts him. Yameen is threatening to arrest him.??
According to the media, barring Shareef, the rest of the four commissioners have left the Maldives. The UN Representative in the Maldives has met Shareef and heard his woes. The US has appealed to Yameen and the Joint Opposition to sit together and sort out issues to bring about a smooth transfer of power.??
Transition Not Easy
According to Ghafoor the situation in the Maldives is ?messy? and transition from Yameen to Solih is not going to be easy. He believes that Yameen will do his utmost to stay in power. He has already changed the chief of the police, and is planning to replace the Elections Commission.??
Yameen has time until October 12 to file complaints against the EC, and if the complaints panel finds merit in his submissions, it could recommend fresh elections. And a reconstituted EC could conduct a fresh poll.??
Yameen?s party has said that it was not ruling out going to the Supreme Court to annul the election. ?The current Supreme Court judges had been handpicked by him. Yameen is counting on them to give a judgment favourable to him,? Ghafoor said.??
But Ghafoor believes that peoples? power will ultimately prevail over Yameen?s machinations.??
Remedial Measures
The Opposition plans a series of measures to prevent recurrence of such sordid happenings.??
?When we take over, we will change the constitution from the Presidential to the Parliamentary system; liberate the judiciary from the clutches of the Executive; and put an end to the rule of kleptocrats,? Ghafoor said.?

MY IMPRESSIONS ON LATEST DRAMA RAVANASITABHILASHAYA
	
?
I consider myself fortunate enough to be among the distinguished gathering of mostly consisting of my, contemporaries of Peradeniya , seniors and juniors who still love drama, to watch and enjoy the third staging of Ravanasitabhilashaya at the Punchi Theatre at Borella recently.?
Except being a lover of drama, I do not know whether I am qualified enough to comment on, or review a unique production of stylized Musical drama which came on stage almost five decades after Maname and Sinhabahu. Among the audience I noticed veteran actors, authors and experienced and renowned critics who will no doubt contribute their views very soon.??
At the very outset let me mention that at the opening of the curtain itself, the beating of the Maddala took us back to the late fifties and early sixties of Peradeniya campus. With the appearance of three Poteguras a novel feature to me, the tempo developed and continued for almost two hours with pin drop silence from the spectators, till the curtain came down with a continuous applause from the enthralled audience. This is good enough to prove a success of a drama although it is too early to comment.? ?
?I heard that the original drama was written by Prof. J.B. Dissanayaka way back in the fifties much before he became a professor and shows the signs of becoming one. Being an erudite scholar who has authored hundreds of books on Sinhala language, culture, literature including traditions and values of Sri Lanka Prof. JB along with his contemporary colleague Namel seems to have updated his script and given a new twist to Walmiki?s Classic Ramayana to suit the modern day Drama with the Nadagan style steps and rhythm and d?cor accompanied with traditional music composed by veteran Jayantha Arvinda of Ratnavali fame.? ?
There is no doubt it is a serious musical drama without common unwarranted cheap sarcasm and ear splitting shrill and bang of drums. The caste which is experienced and new, give life to almost all characters. My comments will be too long if I take them individually. The costumes which blend the attractive and colourful ancient Sri Lankan and Indian styles have been prepared with meticulous care and neatness. Many scenes, songs, dances and dialogues without losing their originality and freshness compelled me to compare and compete with those of Maname and Sinhabahu. This thought has not devalued the quality of the drama but enhanced it.? ?

The whole production seems to me a successful revival of Maname and Sinhabahu tradition and style with inputs of JBs and Namel?s wide experience enriching with modern theatrical developments in stage management and lighting.?
My genuine fear is whether the theatres or the stages in the country except a limited number in Colombo and outstations are geared to stage this colourful drama which may limit the opportunity of enjoying such a quality performance to a large number of enthusiasts.??
?Let me wish success to all the caste and everyone behind this magnificent production and performance. Credit goes to two veterans Prof. JB and Namel and Producer Malini. I am yet to see a schedule of future performances and I wish to request all lovers of stage drama not to miss the opportunity of seeing it fresh.? ?

Nikki Haley resigns as U.S. Ambassador to UN
	
President Trump?s ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki R. Haley, has resigned, ahead of what Mr. Trump promised on Twitter on Tuesday was a ?big announcement? with Ms. Haley at the White House.
Ms. Haley, a former governor of South Carolina, had been an early and frequent critic of Mr. Trump, so when he named her the envoy to the world body weeks after his election in November 2016, the appointment was seen as an olive branch.
The daughter of immigrants from India, Ms. Haley favored free markets and global trade and earned international attention for speaking out against the Confederate battle flag in the aftermath of the 2015 massacre at a black church in Charleston.
During Mr. Trump?s presidential campaign, she sharply criticized his demeanor and warned what it might mean for American diplomacy? even suggesting that his tendency to lash out at critics could cause a world war. (New York Times)

Nishantha Wickremasinghe allocated Dubai apartment for female officer
	
Within the period from 2012 to 2014, the then SriLankan Airlines Chairman Nishantha Wickremasinghe had allocated Rs.2.4 million for an apartment for a female Sales Support Officer in Dubai but previously it was claimed as an accommodation for executive trainees, it was told at the SriLankan Airlines Commission yesterday.
SriLankan Airlines, Head of Finance, Yasantha Dissanayake informed the Presidential Commission of Inquiry (PCoI) on irregularities at SriLankan airlines, SriLankan Catering and Mihin Lanka that the then Chairman Nishantha Wickremasinghe had directed the company finance division to allocate a monthly payment for an apartment in Dubai stating it was for executive trainees in Dubai but it was allocated for a person called Shehani Rodrigo, a Sales Support Officer in Dubai.
He said that the invoices of the particular apartment mentioned the particular female Sales Support Officer?s name and not the company name.
?By the time we got to know about the incident she has taken the apartment on lease and was not a member of any training program. Periodically when we checked the stations we noticed the name of the invoices given as Shehani Rodigo and she was also paid with housing allowance as specified in the appointment letter,? he said.
At the Commission, SriLankan Airlines Manager, Human Resources and Administration, Lasantha Liyanage informed that the particular female Sales Support Officer had previously served as a Flight Attendant at SriLankan and she had personally requested Chairman Nishantha Wickremasinghe to grant her no pay leave for a period of one year.
He said the Chairman had granted her one year no pay leave with a transfer to Airport Services and her first appointment was in Singapore as a Sales Support Officer. He said that this appointment was not informed to the HR division and it was not an approved position by the HR.
He also informed the Commission that by the time she resigned from SriLankan Airlines, the Company IT division had changed her designation to SriLankan Manager, Ticket office and Marketing in UAE, which was not approved by the HR division. (Yoshitha Perera)

Partying to mark the parting of the ways!
	
They have reportedly had their last?supper in style.
?
This term-end dinner that has become an honoured traditional event had been held in an official residence located in the premises where once the palace of the country?s last king stood and it had cost each provincial purohita Rs. 10,000 and each member Rs. 3,000.
The council?s white-collar high-ups too had attended this dinner where liquor had flowed freely.
The partying had gone on till midnight, where everyone had bidden every other one goodbye while expressing the fervent wish to meet again under the same roof under similar circumstances.
Only one untoward incident had marred the happy event:? one provincial politico who had collared a council white-collar high-up inside a room in the official residence had reportedly abused him in filth for failing to carry out an order given by him.

Pilibimbu Not just a competition
	
Hiranya Malwatte, who takes amasing photographs of our landscapes, people, and cultural sites, once made an interesting observation about why young people take to photography so much today. She contended that it is because to the aspiring artiste, even the most mundane picture becomes a work of art. Roughly the same argument can be made of aspiring novelists, actors, playwrights, and directors: they all think their first work is so great that it is impervious to further improvement.? ?
Think about it. That picture of a rose or siyambala tree in your garden, that first shot of your pet dog, that amasingly clear image of dewdrops on a wet morning. The first time you took them, particularly on a DSLR, you thought they would make the final cut, or would at least be worthy of an exhibition. Presumptuousness is and has always been the preserve of youth, so it is in our adolescence, when we are armed with good enough cameras and camera equipment, that we feel we have conquered the world with the most ordinary picture.??
And at the end of the day, as expected, the results are despairing. I have been to literary festivals and awards shortlist ceremonies and I have come across the exact same comment made by the judges; that for every masterpiece they are fortunate enough to come across, they have to wade through hundreds of rubbish packaged in the form of superficially novel themes, ideas, and characters. In other words, the same ideas reworked a hundred times over are, for many, THE literary ideas of the era, if not year.? ?
Act of taking a photograph?
Part of the reason for this is that we are enthralled by the act of taking a photograph. The movies are to blame for that, since somewhere in the sixties, Hollywood turned the lonely artist into an unwilling hero. Michelangelo Antonioni in Blow-up turned a fashion photographer into an obsessed detective who tries to solve the world?s greatest mystery: how much of what we see is real, how much of it is myth? From that point on, Hollywood?s heroes were no longer detectives, lieutenants, and treasure hunters. They were artists, writers, creative directors, and of course, photographers. The end result, as expected, was the idea that being a photographer, like being a musician, was not only cool, it was also ?mod? in some metaphysical, existential way.? ?
?Time flies and only our death can stop it,? Henri Cartier-Bresson, one of the greatest practitioners of the art, wrote. And yet, most young photographers I encounter seem so rushed that not even death can stop them. Like the hero of Blow-up, they seem cursed with the idea of the artist as a hero: they want to prove to themselves and to everyone else - elders, friends, crushes - that they have what it takes to turn their DLSRs into a commercial tool. Not that they are moved by the money, of course. But as with every artist, their sense of urgency has transformed photography into something to make a profit out of.?
Hiranya?s remarks about these young people and the art they take to is depressing in that sense, because photography was never the preserve of the young (at least not the way it is now). Cartier-Bresson, to give just one example, had to go through art school before he decided to shift to photography, then the newest of all art forms. That sense of carefree randomness in his early work came from his experiences as an art student.?
October is not the month of photography, not in Sri Lanka anyway. And yet, it is special. Almost invariably, it is the month of Pilibimbu, to me the answer if not one of the few answers we have to the problems I?ve outlined before. I have already written of Pilibimbu to this paper. All that needs to be rewritten here, then, is that it is the exhibition and final showcase event of the year of the country?s oldest school based such club, the Photographic Art Society of Ananda College.? ?
Ananda College is not the only school with a photography society, but it is one of the few schools, in and around Colombo, that has a set of students dedicated to the craft. When it was inaugurated in 1946, and later as it evolved along, it counted among its members (Dr) Hudson Silva, D. B. Nihalsinghe and his brother Suranimala, Indra de Lanerolle, Daya Ranaweera, and Upali Athurugiriya. According to K. L. F. Wijedasa, who was kind enough to furnish me with these names, the Physics Teacher at Ananda, L. S. R. Wijetunga, ?used to come to the darkroom and help them [the members] with the filters.? The society had established a cinematographic unit overseen by D. B. Nihalsinghe.? ?
Over the months, I have come across certain members from the Society.?
The difference between students from a society at a school like Ananda and those from societies that fall outside the school photography circle in Colombo is that for the former, photography is more than just taking photographs. They have understood the ?art? in the field, but are not enthralled by it so much that they pass over the other dynamics which determine the art.? ?
Photography and cinema
Most students I know who take to photography, for instance, are unaware of or choose to ignore the relationship between photography and the cinema, between the still and the moving image, and are therefore unresponsive to art forms that, while different to photography, can go a long way in shaping the aspiring photographer. In that sense Bumindu Jayaratne, this year?s President, is a refreshing contrast: a film aficionado, he is acutely aware of, and has frequently talked with me, about our cinema.?
And yet, the eclecticism of these two young men is more the exception than the norm among their peers from elsewhere. At least partly, that explains why and how one set of schools has been able to capture the school based photography scene in not just Colombo, but also Sri Lanka. In particular, Ananda: as more than one commentator has told me, that school has gained a reputation (at least by the standards of popular Colombo institutions which privilege hard subjects like science) for inculcating within its students a love for the arts.?
Perhaps all these are connected. Perhaps they are not. All I know is that we are facing a problem, in this field and this country. The truth needs to be told: there are too many photographers engaged in too little photography. I am tired of reducing every problem of the arts to the indifference of the young. And yet, they remain indifferent. And stubborn. Hiranya, I am sure, would agree. As would the organisers of Pilibimbu and the members of the Society at Ananda. And as would Bumindu and Kavindu.
?
?
Organised by the Photographic Art Society of Ananda College, Pilibimbu will open to the public on October 18 from 2 p.m onwards at the Lionel Edirisinghe Rostrum of the University of Visual and Performing Arts.

## Title: POLITICS LAZY VOTERS and MERCENARY MEDIA
## Section: Opinion

POLITICS LAZY VOTERS and MERCENARY MEDIA
	
?
Dependence on pre-packaged knowledge starts very early and gets steadily worse
	The absence of training in critical thinking leads voters to swallow docilely what is spouted from political platforms?
?
The title of this article is perforce unflattering but there is overwhelming evidence to indicate that it is only a small number of citizens and TV media in Sri Lanka, to whom the above descriptions would not apply. The bases for this declaration are explained below.??
American Professor Hardy Cross, who invented the celebrated ?Moment-distribution method? for analyzing the behaviour of continuous beams, made a very striking observation in his book Engineers and Ivory Towers.??
What he had noted was that most people, presumably his fellow Americans, whether they were engineers or not, would stubbornly prefer to spend almost any amount of time on unchallenging drudgery to get a job done so long as they did not have to think about finding a more efficient way of doing so.
It does not require reference to a controlled scientific research programme to aver that the disinclination to make an intelligent effort to carry out a specific task manifests itself far more strongly in almost every sphere of activity in Sri Lanka than it would in the US, and sadly more so, when it comes to electing the people?s representatives.??
?
There are not many of them that do even a few days of honest work for the welfare of the country that they proclaim they love so much??
The plain truth is that our people are mentally lazy and want decision-making information of every kind to be spoon-fed to them.??
This dependence on pre-packaged knowledge starts very early on in life and gets steadily worse as the individual grows older.??
The proliferation of tuition classes that have as their sole objective the coaching of students to pass certain key examinations, with no room whatever to develop creativity and reasoning is the inevitable consequence.
This is also why newspaper-reading, which requires at least a small measure of mental exertion, is tending to decrease in contrast to the painless and passive absorption of the non-challenging contents of most TV programmes.??
This indolence is not a new phenomenon because, as far back as the early 1950s, it was observable that the pedagogues, at least in the science streams in the sole University that we had then, who gave the largest volume of examination-oriented notes, were the ones who were the most popular.
The rare lecturers who tried to get the undergraduates of that era to exercise their brains rigorously were greatly disliked because they did not dictate or distribute voluminous notes that would help the multitude of long-spoilt crammers to prepare blindly for their examinations.?
?
Remarkably, many of those who graduated from this thought-killing environment were able to produce good work later, when exposed to the mentally-challenging ambience that prevails in the reputed centres of learning overseas to which they usually went for their post-graduate work.??
The almost complete absence of training in critical and lateral thinking during the 14-17 year period of Sri Lankan schooling over the past seven decades leads, among other things, to our citizens tending to swallow docilely, what is spouted from political platforms and the media in the same way as these very citizens were schooled? that is, more or less unquestioning acceptance by force of habit of ?facts? that are presented to them by persons and media sources to whom they are already committed culturally or emotionally.??
In other words, it is the pre-favoured messengers? messages that are accepted without detached comparisons with the messages sent by their rivals.??
Whatever Politician A says will tend to be embraced with practically no questioning by his/her loyal followers and whatever Politician B says will be received similarly by the latter?s loyal followers; and so on.??
The credibility gap is widened where Politician A happens to have greater charisma and is more adept than his rivals at lying convincingly.??
Undiscerning voters ? who are regrettably in the majority ? would cast caution to the winds and vote for Politician A to the ultimate detriment of the country.??
Is it surprising that our politically brain-dead citizens keep electing so many representatives who are so dishonest that, while shamelessly grabbing their full salaries and all the accompanying allowances, they attend Parliament far from regularly and contribute even less frequently to important debates and committee work???
In a January 2014 article titled GROSSLY-UNDERPERFORMING MEMBERS OF PARLIAMENT (v. www.cimogg-srilanka.org), we mentioned that, inter alia, S.M. Chandrasena, Weerakumara Dissanayake, Atureliya Rathana Thera and E. Saravanapavan, did not attend even one of the 100 meetings of COPE, of which they were members during 2012/2013.??
Namal Rajapaksa, who former President Mahinda Rajapaksa is believed to be grooming to be Executive President of Sri Lanka, no less, managed a 3% attendance!??
For that matter, Mahinda Rajapaksa, in his new avatar as MP for Kurunegala, has certainly not been setting a worthy example, where regular attendance is concerned.??
Even where the attendance of some members may look good, the inescapable reality is that much of the time spent by them within the premises of Parliament goes to plotting schemes that have only their own personal and party interests in mind.??
There are not many of them that do even a few days of honest work for the welfare of the country that they proclaim they love so much.
Needless to say, our TV stations cannot be blamed for the steady deterioration of Sri Lankan standards and productivity over the first 30 years since Independence but, subsequently, there is no question that they have pandered more and more to the demand for mind-numbing entertainment without considering their corporate social responsibility obligations.??
Instead of helping Sri Lankans to learn to think for themselves, objectively and rationally, too many TV programmes attack their viewers? brains so adversely that the descent of our citizens into persistent intellectual darkness is inexorable.??
Another important factor that is responsible for the failure of our citizens to cast their valuable votes in a judiciously-evaluated manner is that our TV stations conduct political ?seminars? long after their peak money-making hours, just when most working people are getting ready to go to bed or early in the morning, when there is limited time to deal with multiple domestic chores before rushing off to work.??
As might be expected, it is mostly seniors who would find the leisure to sit through these ill-scheduled programmes. Don?t the TV stations care even a little bit about the rest of the voting public?
To make things worse, much of the time at these talk-shows is spent on destructive criticism of each other by political rivals, so much so that too little room is left for the objective comparison of what individual participants have to say.??
In contrast, in better managed countries, on certain days of the week, a small amount of costly prime time is set apart by TV stations for the presentation in reasonable depth of all points of view on questions of national or regional importance so that citizens may come to a balanced view of the problems being discussed and the alternative solutions that are proposed during the presentation of the diverse viewpoints.??
In lotus-eating Sri Lanka, however, prime time is given over exclusively to entertainment programmes that attract the highest proportion of advertising revenue.
The owners of TV stations here are so oriented towards maximizing their profits that they do not see the dire need there is to set aside, say, two half-hour periods every week at prime time to get small groups of informed and well-conducted persons (Not yelling and screaming politicos) to give a variety of views on matters of current political concern so as to allow citizens to come to their own conclusions regarding questions of national significance.??
The other regrettable characteristic of our TV stations is that they boost the image of promising politicians who, when successful at the ballot, will be expected to foster strongly the interests of the respective stations that have contributed to the building of the politicians? public image.??
Family relationships and business connections are the more common elements that decide which station will support which politician.
?
In lotus-eating Sri Lanka, however, prime time is given over exclusively to entertainment programmes that attract the highest proportion of advertising revenue
Thankfully, the thug who used to get TV stations attacked by his minions with fire and bombs has been relegated by his political masters to the wilderness and, hence, we consider that at least now there could surely be a little less unadulterated loyalty to one?s own pet political candidates and a fairer chance given to less known and possibly better candidates.??
Individual printed journals are generally no less partisan than TV stations but their present impact tends to be much less than in pre-TV days because the public spend less and less time on newspapers and much more time watching TV.??
Moreover, the number of persons who read the more informative articles in the print media constitutes only a fraction of those who actually buy newspapers. The majority look for obituaries, reviews of entertainment and places to eat, business news, hints about on-going political machinations and the private life of well-known persons, sensational crimes, astrological forecasts and so on.??
Consequently, one is forced to the conclusion that the serious contents of printed media are able to influence the views of only a minority of newspaper readers and do not influence significantly the political choices that the rest of our citizens make.??

On receiving intelligence that a move was afoot to defeat the annual budget, the provincial chief had quietly met the group of Opposition members and secured their consent to vote for it by offering them a foreign holiday as inducement. These members had kept their word, but the chief had made himself scarce ever since the passage of the budget.

SL Government slow to return land: HRW
	
The Sri Lankan government has yet to fully restore civilian ownership of land and property nearly a decade since the end of the civil war in 2009, Human Rights Watch (HRW) said in a report released today.
Progress, particularly since the election of a new government in 2015, has been hindered by broad military claims of national security and the lack of a transparent process.
The 80-page report, ??Why Can?t We Go Home??: Military Occupation of Land in Sri Lanka,? details security force occupation of land both during and after the armed conflict. It identifies the lack of transparency and due process, failure to map occupied land, inadequate support to affected people and communities, and prolonged delays in providing appropriate reparations for decades of loss and suffering. The military has also used some confiscated lands for commercial profit rather than national security and returned damaged or destroyed property to owners without compensation.
?All those displaced during Sri Lanka?s brutal civil war are entitled to return to their homes,? said Meenakshi Ganguly, South Asia director. ?Despite repeated pledges by the authorities, the military has been frustratingly slow to restore land to its rightful owners.?
The report is based on over 100 interviews between August 2017 to May 2018 with members of affected communities, activists, local officials, and lawyers. It looks into cases of military occupation and land release in 20 areas in six districts, primarily in Sri Lanka?s north and east.
The three-decade civil war in Sri Lanka ended with the decisive defeat of the separatist Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in May 2009. Large areas, including those previously held by the LTTE in the north and east, came under military control. At the end of the war, some 300,000 people ended up in a military detention camp.
While the administration of then-President Mahinda Rajapaksa released some land to its original owners, the military retained control over large areas for military but also non-military purposes, such as agriculture, tourism, and other commercial ventures.
The new government, led by President Maithripala Sirisena, took some steps to release civilian land held by the security forces. At the United Nations Human Rights Council in October 2015, the government promised to address conflict-related issues, including returning land to its original owners. However, the government?s response has fallen far short of its promises. On October 4, 2018, the president ordered the state to release all civilian land by December 31, 2018.
The military has also retained control of land it previously announced it would return. For instance, in April 2017, the navy responded to protests by displaced communities from the Mullikulam area in Mannar by announcing it would release 100 acres of the land that security forces had been occupying. More than a year later, people are still waiting.
?Now there is no war,? said Francis Crooss, a village elder. ?It?s now peacetime. So why can?t we go back home??
State agencies have exchanged properties without releasing the land to civilians. In Pallimunai in Mannar, land belonging to residents displaced since 1990 was occupied first by the army and then the police. At war?s end, the police promised to release their land and homes, but instead, the navy took control.
?We?ve been made refugees in our own village,? said Helena Perera, one of the residents.
All three major ethnic communities in the country ? the Sinhalese, Tamils, and Muslims ? are affected by military occupation of land in the north and east. However, the vast majority of cases impact the Tamil community.
Human Rights Watch documented a number of cases in which properties were destroyed while held by the military after the war, including Hindu temples, churches, mosques, and Buddhist shrines.
Government authorities have also carried out land grabs since the end of the war. In July 2010, the military forcibly evicted residents of Ragamwela, Panama, in southeastern Ampara district. In November 2011, 200 soldiers arrived in Ashraf Nagar village in Ampara district and demanded that all its occupants leave. In such cases, the security forces set up military camps or used the land for other purposes, including commercial use.
The government?s failure to establish a uniform policy on resettlement remains a critical problem, Human Rights Watch said. Some displaced families did not receive proper resettlement assistance when they returned to formerly occupied lands. The government transferred others from displacement camps, but they then entered into other forms of displacement, such as living with friends and relatives, or moving to other camps closer to their original properties, which the military still occupied. Those resettled more than once were denied full resettlement assistance when their land was eventually released.
A 70-year-old fisherman from Myliddy said his family had moved 24 times in 27 years until the military released his property in July 2017. But without resettlement assistance, he is severely in debt. ?We hope the government will at least help us restart our lives this one last time,? he said.
Partial releases pose particular problems for returnee communities. Military control of neighboring areas hinders access to services and jobs, and heightens fears of surveillance and harassment by soldiers.
Establishing ownership of land where multiple displacements have occurred over decades is difficult, Human Rights Watch said. But instead of leaving it exclusively to the military, the government should urgently set up a transparent and consultative process, including displaced communities, to establish land claims and restore civilian ownership.
?The government has adopted an arbitrary, piecemeal approach to land returns, which is fomenting deep distrust among communities wary that the military is still in charge,? Ganguly said. ?It should address rights violations and provide remedies to end the distress of those who have long suffered because of the military?s occupation of land.?

Sri Lankans  Are they growing old  before becoming rich   ?
	
The esteemed panel comprised key representatives from the Government of Sri Lanka, experts and policy leadersPix by Kushan Pathiraja
?
?
Ageing is inevitable. In the world, the number of people aged 60 years and over has tripled since 1950, reaching 600 million in 2000 and surpassing 700 million in 2006. It?s projected that the combined senior and geriatric population will reach 2.1 billion by 2050.? ?
Sri Lanka, with the highest ageing population in the whole of South Asia, has around 14.6 million out of a total of 21 million people who are over the age of 55 years. By 2030, 1 in 5 people in Sri Lanka will be above the age of 60. While ageing is a triumph of development that indicates Sri Lanka?s continuous investment in the well-being of its people, is Sri Lanka ready to face this rapid demographic transition?? ?
Is Sri Lanka ready to face the unprecedented problem that the elderly population will soon outnumber the young population, leading to many social, health and economic problems? Can we accompany our elder population to a place where they can contribute more to the development of the country through their experiences and maturity or will they be vulnerable to productivity and be more affected with non-communicable diseases of which costs are skyrocketing in the country at present?? ?
To mark ?International Day of Older Persons?, which is commemorated on October 1, the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) in partnership with the Ministry of Social Welfare and Primary Industries convened the first of a series of high-level policy dialogues, titled ?Ageing Without Limits: Enhancing Policies: Maximizing Potentials? which aimed to provide policy-level inputs to maximise the opportunity of the population ageing with International guest speakers.? ?
?
The youth in Sri Lanka need to be informed of the benefits of savings and investments for a pre-retirement plan, so that it will in future ease the requirements for financial subsidies
Minister Daya Gamage
?
Making active ageing a reality
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the Active Ageing concept refers to the continuing participation in social, economic, cultural, spiritual and civic affairs, not just the ability to be physically active or to participate in the labour force.? ?
The theme for the first UNFPA policy dialogue was ?Making Active Ageing a Reality?, and it focused on how population ageing must be addressed through an evidence-based approach, life-cycle approach, and rights-based approach. The evidence-based approach focuses on the role of data that informs policy decisions. The lifecycle approach highlights the need to invest in youth to ensure they age with economic security and life skills. The rights-based approach relates to socio-cultural aspects of ageing, such as the gender dimension and the need to shift the traditional role of elderly women as caregivers.? ?
The esteemed panel comprised key representatives from the Government of Sri Lanka and experts and policy leaders, including Dr. Karen Makishima, Member, House of Representatives in Japan, and Prof. Rahmiah Ibrahim, Head of Department of Human Development and Family Studies of University Putra, Malaysia.? ?
?
Financing the elder population must be considered by countries. In Malaysia, we have multi-sectoral support for the agedProf. Rahimah Ibrahim
?
Raising awareness of the youth
In his opening remarks, Daya Gamage, Minister of Social Welfare and Primary Industries stated that Sri Lanka will be the 3rd aged society in Asia by 2030 and this demographic shift is an opportunity for the Government to create a conductive environment to utilise the wealth of the experience and knowledge that the elderly can contribute to the society.? ?
?The increase in the older population will turn out to create several social problems. However, the present Government greets this demographic transition with pleasure and it is considered as a great opportunity for the country?s future. Apart from the civil servants and employers of the organised sectors, elderly persons in the informal sector are not sufficiently covered by pension or insurance schemes.? ?
Not just Sri Lanka, but many countries are currently mulling over the introduction of a contributory method to address the requirements of the elderly in the informal category. The youth in Sri Lanka need to be informed of the benefits of savings and investments for a pre-retirement plan, so that it will in future ease the requirements for financial subsidies,? Minister Gamage stated.? ?
He also said that the Ministry of Social Welfare and National Institute of Social Development will train 10,000 youth for the provision of care for elders during the coming two years. According to him the Cabinet has already approved funds for the project.? ?
Women who rely on their families or their partners may not know how to access resources because the literacy level of older women is relatively lower than?older men
Dr. Sudarshini Fernandopulle
?
Maximising the potential of older persons
Japan, having a super-ageing society, has identified four aspects of contemporary provision that offer potential gains in quality of life and health. Those four aspects are nutritional support, life rehabilitation, mandated staffing ratios and seasonality and cultural practice.? ?
Member, House of Representatives, Japan, Dr. Karen Makishima, said, ?Japan is the front runner of an ageing society. We have established and are considering various policies to prepare for 100 years of life, including re-education systems and plans to abolish the retirement age and introduce a re-employment system?.? ?
Meanwhile, Representative of UNFPA Sri Lanka Ritsu Nacken said, ?Preparing for an ageing population is vital for the achievement of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, to ensure that no one is left behind. This is why it is important to maximise the potential of older persons, especially of elderly women?.? ?
?Here in Sri Lanka the population is rapidly ageing. According to standard projections, the number of people aged 60 years and over will double by 2050. Therefore, it is the right time to have a policy dialogue on the ageing population. There has to be a human rights approach when looking into the ageing population issue. We also have to recognise that population ageing is a result of achievements,? Nacken said.? ?

Gender dimensions of population ageing
Nacken further stated, ?The majority of the elders in Sri Lanka are women because women outreach men in this island. Women face vulnerability in the country mainly because female labour participation is very low. Therefore, female elders may not have a social protection system compared to men. We have to ensure that women have a better life in the older age too. We also need to think of a transformation of the basic family care system into a holistic society wide protection system, which will ultimately address the gender issue also?.??
Adding to Nacken?s opinion, Dr. Sudarshini Fernandopulle, Member of Parliament said, ?As we all know Sri Lankan women enjoy a longer life than men. Of the total elder population, 56% are women and 61% of them are 80 years and above. As a result women who rely on their families or their partners may not know how to access resources because the literacy level of older women is relatively lower than older men. Women may also face other social issues and challenges. As women age, there is an increased risk of Non-Communicable Diseases (NCD),?she said.
Prof. Rahimah Ibrahim, Head of Department of Human Development and Family Studies, University Putra Malaysia, said, ?Between 2020 and 2046, Malaysia?s 65+ population will double from 7% to 14%. Financing the elder population must be considered by countries. In Malaysia, we have multi-sectoral support for the aged, from the Government, Private Sector, and Civil Society,? said Ibrahim.?
Prof. Lakshman Dissanayake, Vice Chancellor, University of Colombo, was also one of the distinguished members of the panel. He highlighted the importance of data and feminisation of ageing, among other important points. The panel was moderated by Dr. Ganeshan Wignaraja, Executive Director, Lakshman Kadirgamar Institute. Officials from the Government, international community, civil society, academia, and the media engaged in the dialogue. UNFPA said it would continue this series of dialogues to provide inputs to strengthen policies and support the development and implementation of a holistic system to ensure Sri Lanka is prepared to maximise the opportunity of this demographic transition.

Suu Kyi promises ?transparency? over Rohingya atrocities

TOKYO AFP Oct8, 2018-Embattled leader Aung San Suu Kyi vowed Monday to increase transparency over her government?s handling of the Rohingya crisis while pitching for foreign investment in Myanmar ahead of a regional summit in Tokyo.? ?
Suu Kyi, once garlanded as a global rights champion, has seen a sharp fall from grace due to her failure to speak up following a brutal military crackdown on Myanmar?s Rohingya minority.? ?
??I?m ready to acknowledge that we have challenges to face particularly with regard to the Rakhine and with the struggles we have on the peace front,? Suu Kyi said in a speech before Japanese businessmen, referring to Myanmar?s westernmost state where the minority dwelled.? ?
??We are not hiding this fact from our friends,? she said.?
?We understand that peace, reconciliation, harmony, stability, rule of law, human rights -- all these have to be taken into consideration when we are looking for more investment, for greater economic opportunities,? she said.
In the speech ahead of the summit in Tokyo, Suu Kyi said she was aware that peace and stability in her country were necessary for attracting foreign investment.?

The World has until 2030  to stem climate change
	
?
Governments around the world must take ?rapid, far-reaching and unprecedented changes in all aspects of society? to avoid disastrous levels of global warming, says a stark new report from the global scientific authority on climate change.? ?
?The landmark UN report on limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius was released in South Korea on Monday after a week-long meeting of the 195-nation Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).? ?
A ?Summary for Policymakers? of the 400-page tome underscores how quickly global warming has outstripped humanity?s attempts to tame it, and outlines stark options --all requiring a makeover of the world economy-- for avoiding the worst ravages of climate change.? ?
?Capping global warming at 1.5C (2.7 F) above pre-industrial levels will require ?rapid, far-reaching and unprecedented changes in all aspects of society?, the IPCC said.? ?
At current levels of greenhouse gas emissions, we could pass the 1.5C marker as early as 2030, and no later than mid-century, the report finds with ?high confidence?.? ?
Earth?s average surface temperature has already gone up 1C --enough to unleash a crescendo of deadly extreme weather-- and is on track to rise another two or three degrees absent a sharp and sustained reduction in carbon pollution.? ?
Most worrying of all, perhaps, are temperature thresholds between 1.5C and 2C that could push Arctic sea ice, methane-laden permafrost, and melting polar ice sheets with enough frozen water to lift oceans by a dozen metres, past a point of no return.? ?
To have at least a 50-50 chance of staying under 1.5C without overshooting the mark, the world must, by 2050, become ?carbon neutral?.? ?

Tree planting ceremony at Mannar
	
A tree planting ceremony organized by the Geological Survey and Mines Bureau (GSMB) was held at Musali, Mannar in line with the ?Wanaropa? tree planting ceremony under the patronage of GSMB Chairman Asela Iddawela recently.
The condition of the land which was selected for the tree planting, had been deteriorating due to excavation and GSMB had taken measures to develop the land in several phases.
Accordingly, the GSMB had erected the fallen trees and the land had been prepared to retain water. Then it had planted around 5,000 plants endemic to the area.
GSMB Director General C.H.E.R. Siriwardane, Senior Director (Excavation) Eng. D. Sajjana de Silva, Chief Internal Auditor E.L Chandrasena, Musali Divisional Secretary, Chairman of the Musali Pradeshiya Sabha, Chief Engineer of the GSMB Anuradhapura Divisional Office Chamila Karunananda and officials participated in the event.

Winning good will and incurring ill-will!
	
?
A senior top team member has lately stopped inviting his deputy to the Ministry functions or conferences.
?
As a result, the deputy has become conspicuous by his absence at both at the routine and special Ministry events like the regular conferences progress review meetings, agreement signing events etc.
The top team member has distanced his deputy from all Ministry functions ever since the latter won accolades from the party leader for taking the initiative to settle a major strike that threatened the working of a key department coming under the purview of this Ministry, they say.
It is well-known that the top team member in question is a very ambitious one who once had his eye on the highest office in the country.
