A compromise to have their clothes on!
	

A group of Green backbenchers had met recently and their discussion had mainly centred on the doings of the khaki chief.

Their collective opinion was that Yahapalanaya was sure to get into more serious trouble if the man was allowed to continue in office any longer.
One of them expressed his disgust over the passive attitude of the top duo towards the issue.
Meanwhile, another member suggested: If the JO moves a No Confidence against the man, let us support it!
This suggestion drew an instant protest from yet another member.
I say, are we to support a motion by the JO with our clothes on And that drew a chorus of ayes.
Later they reached a compromise: to fade from the scene at the voting time if a No Confidence motion was moved by the JO.

A deadline timed with the Annual Budget!
	

The Green party burly one sulking over the loss of the prestigious portfolio, made calculated moves one after another from time to time to make a comeback to the former glory without success.

Undeterred, never lacking the never say die spirit, the burly one has over the time won the loyalty of a group of backbenchers and is now set to deal a fatal blow to Yahapalanaya itself, they say.
Issuing an ultimatum to those who matter, he has given time till the first week of next December to decide to do or die.
The threat he has held out, they say, is closely connected to a big event in the Yahapalanaya calendar: the unveiling of the decisive annual Budget for 2019.

A radical change in the political scene in the offing
	

The political sibling -aka Master Brain behind Pohottuwa-who had just begun a three-month holiday in the land of Uncle Sam had taken the party men by surprise when he suddenly returned home last Tuesday.

Party stalwarts and pals, who knew well that the far-sighted sibling would not have cut short his vacation on a whim, had made immediate inquiries direct and indirect to ascertain the reason for it, but a firm mum had been the response from all sources.
Nevertheless, a few enterprising party heavyweights had learnt the million-dollar reason from a link in the family chain: that he is due to meet a very high Yahapalanaya authority for a political significant powwow.
A very significant move decisive for the Pohottuwas political future, is about to take the country by storm and several Pohottuwa high-ups already wise to this move, are now up in arms against it, they say.

A summary dismissal!
	

The King Rooster from the estate domain had recently taken several prospective investors from the neighbouring country to a white-collar bigwig at a key Ministry. Introductory civilities over, he had explained that the visitors were interested in undertaking a multi-million-dollar project in this country.

However, the bigwig had told the King Rooster point blank:
You are no friend of this Government. We know your loyalties are with the former boss. So, dont pretend to these investors that you are someone close to this Government. I am sorry, I cant help you in any matter in which you are personally interested!
The beads of perspiration had sprung up on King Roosters forehead and as he stood up crestfallen, he had found the investors were already making their exit, they say.

ASEAN urges accountability for violence in Myanmar
	

SINGAPORE REUTERS Oct 2 2018- Southeast Asian Foreign Ministers urged Myanmar to give a commission of inquiry into the violence in Rakhine state full mandate to hold those who are responsible accountable, Singapore said on Tuesday. 
The ministers, who met informally on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly last week, expressed grave concern over the violence, Singapore Foreign Minister Vivian Balakrishnan told parliament, calling it man-made humanitarian disaster. 
Over the last year, more than 700,000 Rohingya Muslims have fled Buddhist-majority Myanmar to neighbouring Bangladesh, according to U.N. agencies, following a military response to attacks on security posts by Rohingya insurgents. 
U.N. investigators issued a report in late August accusing Myanmars military of gang rapes and mass killings with genocidal intent in Rakhine and called for the countrys commander-in-chief and five generals to be prosecuted under international law. Myanmar has denied most of the allegations in the report, blaming Rohingya terrorists for most accounts of atrocities. 
We expressed our grave concern with these alleged acts of violence... This is a man-made humanitarian disaster and something which should not be happening in this day and age, Balakrishnan said, referring to the meeting of the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations, which includes Myanmar.

Attack on Animal SOS Sri Lanka : Public nuisance vs animal welfare Can co-existence be the answer
	
Feeding time for dogs

They also throw firecrackers when officials arrive
	
	Tourists visit our sanctuary with relief and joy that at least someone is helping the suffering street animals
	
	The list of allegations would be laughable elsewhere, but here in Sri Lanka, everything is blamed on the poor dogs
	
	These supplies were donated by kind UK supporters
	
	A lawyer represented the shelter and said that he would inform the administration regarding the matters that have been discussed


The streets of Sri Lanka would look somewhat uninteresting for a dog lover without the occasional mongrel loitering around. Stray dogs were allowed to roam freely around the city and the suburbs for years until they were identified as threats. What was quite common on the streets became a threat to many individuals in society, who campaigned against their well-being. This eventually encouraged the authorities to inhumanely get rid of these poor creatures at one point in time. While many neglected these dogs and a few cats, there were some who were willing to give them a safe haven. But just about a week ago, an unruly mob decided to impose a threat throwing firecrackers and putting roadblocks at Animal SOS Sri Lanka; another one of those rarely found dog shelters located in the South ofSri Lanka. 

Animal SOS Sri Lanka
Founded in 2007, Animal SOS Sri Lanka is a UK-based charity which was established under the vision of its founder Kim Cooling. She decided to establish this cause after witnessing the appalling plight of animals in Sri Lanka, particularly stray animals. After years of self-funded rescue work she purchased a plot of land in Midigama, Ahangama and the charity began operating in 2009 with a few dogs and helpers. Many street animals in Sri Lanka suffer from various diseases, malnutrition and even horrific injures. As Sri Lanka doesnt have many safe havens to protect these stray animals, the work and facilities at Animal SOS Sri Lanka offers a lifeline to these hapless creatures. So far, the shelter has saved the lives of thousands of animals while also providing job opportunities to local people. The shelter also carries out outreach programmes, free neutering, rabies control programmes and even offers English classes for village children. 



Determined to protect animals 
The spoke to Cooling to inquire into the incident and according to her the mob had carried out the attack at night. We need to keep the operations running amidst criminal activities. The Police promised an investigation, but so far no action has been taken by the authorities. Im trying to get through the court case amidst all these, she said. 
She recently posted details of the incident on social media which read as follows: We are tormented and threatened by an unruly mob operating with agendas. The police offer no protection and have been complicit in the past. We have a recording of a villager demanding funds for charity and doing it through threats. This is done to create issues for us with the authorities in case we did not cough up. We refused of course and this happened directly after sacking a staff member in connection with a theft. Instead of the Police taking action against the blackmailer, as they had evidence and stated they would act, they charged us for causing public nuisance and I had to appear in court and stand in the dock like a criminal who had committed a crime. The court case is continuing. 
We had many officials who hated dogs visiting the sanctuary after trumped up charges were made against us. One person had stated that we only have bad dogs at the sanctuary and not good breed dogs like German Shepherds. Some officials arrived wearing masks, giving the impression like we were having the Ebola virus at the sanctuary. 
We were asked why our dogs are roaming free as they should all be caged for life and that the sanctuary should be entirely cemented and sealed due to microbes from the dogs. Some believed that humans can get parvo from dogs, that the dogs at the sanctuary will bite the villagers and that people can get pimples from dogs even though they have no contact with them whatsoever. The list of allegations would be laughable elsewhere, but here in Sri Lanka, EVERYTHING is blamed on the poor dogs due to ignorance. 




The sad plight of these hapless animals motivates kind humans to afford them a safe environment. Its the overpopulation of dogs that gives rise to such issues


Lawyer and animal welfare activist Lalani Perera

They threatened workers who were improving drainage facilities in our cattery and almost drowned all our cats. A member of the mob recently exposed himself to us in front of our Buddhist Shrine. They regularly throw fire crackers into our sanctuary to terrorise our animals; many of whom have suffered so much on the streets and only have our sanctuary as a safe haven. They also threw a stone at a dog. These people caught a dog in the wire snare in the past and abused us when we tried to save its life when it was choking. The dog remains atthe sanctuary. 
They made a roadblock to stop donated supplies, from a shipment, reaching the sanctuary. These supplies were donated by kind UK supporters. We were abused and I was pushed and my camera dropped to the ground. No arrests were made as usual. On one video you can hear firecrackers used to terrorise our animals. They also throw firecrackers when officials arrive and then complain that our dogs are barking. Visiting tourists to the sanctuary have witnessed this mob rule and are both horrified and shocked. Is this the image Sri Lanka wants for its growing tourist industry Tourists visit our sanctuary with relief and joy that at least someone is helping the suffering street animals only to see our efforts under attack by a lawless, frenzied mob. The horrors continue, said Cooling. 

Importance of co-existence 
In her comments to the , lawyer and animal welfare activist Lalani Perera said that the shelter set up by Animal SOS is an exemplary endeavour to care for homeless dogs; some of whom are severely disabled. The sad plight of these hapless animals motivates kind humans to afford them a safe environment. Its the overpopulation of dogs that gives rise to such issues. And, its unfortunate that we humans contribute to that overpopulation by dumping unwanted puppies and even pets when they cannot be cared for, in public places, like market places and temples. Recently I was told about a Buddhist monk who wanted three new-born puppies dumped in his temple, removed from the temple premises since the devotees had complained. Cannot the monk inspire these people (I call them pseudo-Buddhists) to show compassion, the tenet of Buddhism, and find these puppies a home The Government authorities mandated with the task of neutering street dogs are also responsible for this situation, but they arent carrying out that task efficiently, said Perera. 
She further said that as animal shelters are often set up in sparsely populated places and when it becomes inevitable that humans will be neighbours; steps should be taken to ensure that no nuisance or health hazard is caused to humans. Humans and animals must learn to co-exist. Even with regard to the Human-Elephant Conflict, humans are the main precipitators encroaching on elephant habitat, at great cost to both human and elephant lives. 
It is indeed deplorable that a foreigner who has embarked on such a noble mission has to undergo much trauma, Perera added. In this country, where only a minuscule number of local people have set up shelters and engaged in animal welfare, we must support the generosity of outsiders rather than obstruct them, she said. 

Public nuisance 
Speaking to the , Weligama Divisional Secretary Sumith Shantha said that this shelter has been a long-standing issue with regard to the villagers. They began as a clinic where they would treat pets and return them to their homes. But eventually people started dumping puppies and sick dogs at this shelter. Now there are over 2000 dogs here and they cannot manage the place. So you can imagine the disturbance caused when they bark. People also claim that they have lice and other diseases which pose a threat to the neighbours,said Shantha. 
Shantha further said the shelter doesnt have a proper waste disposal system. Therefore they have dug a drain that connects to the main water line and it eventually disposes waste to the surrounding paddy fields. We then informed the officials at the district irrigation department to inspect the place. Following the inspection they claimed that the drain was illegally dug and have requested the administration at the Shelter to close it down. We were also informed that the shelter doesnt comply with the guidelines given by the Central Environmental Authority (CEA). Since it is run by a group of foreigners, not even a Public Health Inspector (PHI) goes to check if they are carrying out their functions accordingly. On top of that the area residents staged a protest demanding they shut down the place. So we had to interfere and promise them that we would take the necessary actions. They have even gone to the extent of filing a case in courts stating that this place is a public nuisance.

Protest staged against the attack

As a result we called for a meeting last Wednesday and pointed out these issues, Shantha added. A lawyer represented the shelter and said that he would inform the administration regarding the matters that have been discussed. We have also informed the CEA, the Divisional Secretariat and the PHIs to conduct inspections accordingly for the benefit of the residents, concluded Shantha.

Police investigate
The Daily Mirror also learned that the Weligama Police are conducting investigations to identify the perpetrators. According to them the villagers have filed a case stating that the shelter has become a public nuisance and it has now come under the purview of the Divisional Secretary.

A group of JO front liners led by the former strongman had recently participated in a Bodhi Pooja held at a temple in the Kurunegala area to invoke blessings on their gabby colleague Johnny cooling his heels in a State-run lodge these days.

Even some politicos in the district, who had occasion to lock horns with Johnny, had participated in this pinkama.
The group that had met at Johnnys residence had later proceeded to the temple and had dispersed from there once the ceremony was over.
Meanwhile, a senior JO Diyawanna member from Digamadulla area had to offer a lift to a party colleague, a member of a local body in the Colombo area and while on the way back, the duo had been engaged in a heart-to-heart chat and former had suddenly blurted out:
Ah! Machang! If we are to hold Bodhi poojas to invoke blessings on rogues at this rate, will there be time for us to do any propaganda work
The local politico had found it difficult to contain his spasms of laughter, they say.

Colombo Declaration 2018 signed : Carrying forward the legacy of media personnel
	

20 years have passed since a group of forward-thinkers decided to set up a cause to promote the ideals of a liberal democracy through a free and responsible press. The Colombo Declaration, a document which was signed in April of 1998, bears testimony to this cause. Over the years the live wires behind this cause have stood firm ground in bringing about freedom of expression and freedom of information for the citizens of Sri Lanka. Although 20 years have elapsed with several positive developments, there are many goals that remain unfulfilled. However in a changing media landscape, that has stepped into the digital age, newer challenges have been identified. Topping these challenges are issues such as media credibility and regulation and therefore the Colombo Declaration 2018 re-evaluated the progress in the field of ethics and responsibilities in media. Hence the recently concluded three-day symposium to mark the 20th anniversary of the Colombo Declaration and Media Responsibility, attracted a diverse group of speakers both local and international who spoke, discussed and debated on a variety of crucial and timely topics. 

It was also revealed that in Sri Lanka theres no public service broadcaster, but the fact that theres plenty of state media. However, in this changing informational environment, the need for a quality public service broadcaster is important

Struggle to protect media freedom
At a time when the media was threatened with criminal defamation charges, the countrys four main media associations joined hands for the first time to bring about media law reforms in Sri Lanka. They included the publishers, editors, working journalists and media activists. Towards the end of 1997 several media organisations, together with some lawyers and well-wishers, met to discuss on the subject of criminal defamation. What resulted was the signing of the Colombo Declaration in 1998 followed by an international symposium that discussed a wider range of issues. The declaration was signed at a time when the then Government engaged in serial indictments against editors and publishes with criminal defamation charges. The declaration was instrumental in repealing criminal defamation charges and several other positive developments. The Sri Lanka Press Institute along with its constituents including the Newspaper Society of Sri Lanka, Free Media Movement, Sri Lanka Working Journalists Association and The Editors Guild of Sri Lanka has made great strides to make it a success. 
Hence, over the past two decades, the following positive developments havetaken place : 

The Abolition of Criminal Defamation provisions in the Penal Code and the Press Council Law in 2002, the repeal of Section 118 of the Penal Code, which had penalised attempts by contumacious or insulting words or signs, to bring the President into contempt.
	
	Repeal of the 1978 amendment to the Parliamentary Powers and Privileges Act (1953), which had given Sri Lankas Parliament the power to deal with serious breaches of privilege. 
	
	The Establishment of the Sri Lanka Press Institute and the Press Complaints Commission and the Sri Lanka College of Journalism. 

The adoption of the 19th Constitutional Amendment adding Article 14A, guaranteeing a constitutional Right To Information, the adoption in 2016 of the Right to Information Act and the establishing of an independent Right to Information Commission.However it is regrettable that apart from these positive developments, there has been little else that has been done to implement the proposals set out in 1998. 

Highlights of the Colombo Declaration 2018
On the occasion of its 20th anniversary, the recently concluded four-day symposium touched upon various topics from media regulation to ensuring the safety of journalists to training upcoming journalists, challenges with implementing the RTI and the way forward, incorporating technology in the media industry and the power of journalism. 

There was another session on Right to Information and one of the very bright points in the Sri Lankan trajectory has been the adoption of the Constitutional Guarantee for the Right to Information

Touching on the key highlights of the sessions, Toby Mendel, Executive Director of the Centre for Law and Democracy, a Canadian-based international human rights NGO, said that its a special occasion as the 20th anniversary version of the Colombo Declaration is signed. What was an attack on media with criminal defamation cases got turned around into a victory for press freedom. It in fact mobilised and unified the community to fight back and alternately led to the adoption of the Colombo Declaration on Media Freedom and Social Responsibility. I work all over the world on media freedom and Right to Information issues and I could say that people are making statements and declarations, but I dont see anything as vast as the Colombo Declaration. Its a comprehensive statement about why the press is important and its a roadmap to show what needs to be done to secure press freedom in this country. Its incredible how 20 years later its still a hallmark and a reference point and therefore its a globally relevant document, said Mendel. 
Referring to the sessions, Mendel said that the several issues from the idea of broadening the scope of the system to embracing the electronic media in both print and online media were raised. In addition to that, the importance of media literacy was stressed, as people need to know what real media is and whats not. It was also revealed that in Sri Lanka theres no public service broadcaster, but the fact that theres plenty of state media. However, in this changing informational environment, the need for a quality public service broadcaster is important. Safety was discussed and things have gotten better in Sri Lanka, but we havent seen accountability with regard to previous abusers. Sri Lanka was one of those countries which made headlines on the attacks and killings of journalists and people involved in the media. There was another session on Right to Information and one of the very bright points in the Sri Lankan trajectory has been the adoption of the Constitutional Guarantee for the Right to Information. It isnt just a legal document, but an actual operational system which we heard of in Sri Lanka. In some other countries, notably in India, there are requests from people at the grassroots level. For example it was interesting to hear about a group of mothers - whose sons and husbands have disappeared- went to the Police with a copy of the RTI act and made demands about information about their loved ones, he opined. 
A panel also spoke on the topic of fake news, Mendel continued. It was interesting to hear one panelist say that there is no such thing as fake news, but on the other hand we do have a problem of inaccuracy and misinformation from various sources and we need to combat it. The panel discussion on contempt of court expressed on a variety of abuses and we heard from the Prime Minister that hes trying to adopt a Contempt of Court act. However, I find the discussion on Contempt of Court a little bit conservative because in many countries you are pretty much free to say whatever you want about judgments, even before they are issued. This could even be while the case is continuing and it doesnt matter whether the guy is guilty or not, because the court is able to do its business notwithstanding what the media reports, even on a biased perspective, he added. 

The declaration was signed at a time when the then Government engaged in serial indictments against editors and publishes with criminal defamation charges

Another panel on training discussed about how Sri Lanka needs to move into new methods of training. They stressed on the fact that innovative and hands-on training is important. This discussion pointed out how journalists need to be trained on a whole package of skills and a journalist should be a multimedia expert. I found an interesting panel on technology and on talking about robot journalists  but I thought it shouldnt come too quickly because the human being is still important. We need to make sure that we integrate technology into our industry and survive as the world evolves. The power of journalists was also discussed and it is enormous. One of the best descriptions of that is if the media wasnt powerful why would Governments around the world try to oppress and attack it! And why would they have wars trying to constrain them Hence these are signs of the power media possess, he added.

Colour-coded registration plates for tuk-tuks: Minister
	
Transport Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva said unique registration plates in different colours would be issued to trishaws that operate as taxis. He said he would request the Commissioner of the Department of Motor Traffic (DMT) to make necessary arrangements in this regard.
Speaking to the media after a discussion with several trishaw associations at the ministry, he said there should be an effective system to identify passenger-transporting trishaws. During the meeting, these associations agreed to new passenger transport licences, considering the minimum age as 35 years. Earlier, the ministry decided to set the minimum age limit for trishaw drivers as 35 years when issuing passenger transport licences.
The minister also informed the Sri Lanka Standards Institution (SLSI) to issue the standards certificate for trishaws that operate as taxis two weeks prior to implementing the law on November 1.
Accordingly, meters that could issue printed bills would be compulsory from August 1, but it was not implemented due to a delay in obtaining standard certificates.(Chaturanga Samarawickrama)

## Title: DOES SRI LANKA HAVE A FOREIGN POLICY AT ALL TODAY
## Section: Opinion
## Date: 3 October 2018 12:00 am
DOES SRI LANKA HAVE A FOREIGN POLICY AT ALL TODAY
	

My approach in this article is to make as little comment as possible, and to let the documentation, consisting of authoritative Resolutions, Statements and other material, speakfor itself.



I. Address by President Sirisena at the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA)
In his address at the UNGA on September 25, 2018, President Maithripala Sirisena made the following strong remarks: My request here is to let us solve our problems. Independence of a country is very important .. As a sovereign State, we need no foreign influence or threats. As such, I reiterate my request to all, as a strong nation, to allow us to sort out our problems as a sovereign nation, that moves forward while protecting our rights.
This is a very clear and, indeed, emphatic statement. The obvious question, however, is whether it reflects continuity even at the basic level with previous solemn commitments or whether there is total inconsistency and contradiction. 

II. UNHRC Resolution 30/1 of October 1, 2015
This is a Resolution by none other than the Government of Sri Lanka itself. Sri Lanka co-sponsored a Resolution proposed by the United States, adopted the Resolution as its own and called upon all Member States to support it unreservedly. The result was the unanimous adoption of the Resolution by the Human Rights Council.
It requires little perception to observe how startlingly intrusive this Resolution is, in content and spirit. No sovereign and independent country, firmly resolved to reject foreign influence, could possibly have agreed to, much less proposed, such a Resolution. 
The Resolution welcomes and encourages the positive engagement between the Government of Sri Lanka and the High Commissioner and the Office of the High Commissioner (for Human Rights)  in exploring appropriate forms of international support for, and participation in, Sri Lankan processes for seeking truth and justice. (Para 2).
It notes with appreciation the proposal of the Government of Sri Lanka to establish a judicial mechanism with a special Counsel .. and affirms in this regard the importance of participation in a Sri Lankan Judicial Mechanism, including the special counsels office, of Commonwealth and other foreign Judges, defence lawyers and authorized prosecutors and investigators (Para 6).
It encourages the Government of Sri Lanka to reform its domestic law to ensure that it can implement effectively .. the recommendations of the report of the Office of the High Commissioner (Para 7).
It encourages the Government of Sri Lanka to introduce effective security sector reforms as part of its transitional justice process (Para 8).
It encourages the Government of Sri Lanka to undertake further efforts to tackle the considerable work that lies ahead in the areas of land use and ownership, in particular the ending of military involvement in civilian activities (Para 10).
It welcomes the commitment of the Government of Sri Lanka to review the Public Security Ordinance and to review and repeal the Prevention of Terrorism Act, and to replace it (Para 12).
It welcomes the commitment of the Government of Sri Lanka to a political settlement by taking the necessary constitutional measures, encourages the Governments efforts to fulfil its commitments on the devolution of political authority (Para 16).
It encourages the Government of Sri Lanka to continue to co-operate with special procedure mandate holders, including by responding formally to outstanding requests (Para 19).
It certainly defies reason how a Government, conscious of its independence and its sovereign right to make decisions on behalf of its people, free of foreign influence, could make such sweeping pledges to foreign countries with regard to matters as crucial as the involvement of foreign judges in war crimes trials against its Armed Forces, the reform of its Armed Forces and Police, limits on land utilization by the military, repeal of pivotal legislation governing security, devolution of power within the country and implementation of foreign directives in respect of this awesome array of issues. Indeed, one would be hard put to conceive of a more comprehensive foreign-led programme.

III. UNHRC Resolution 34/1 of March 23, 2017
Like its predecessor, this Resolution is the direct initiative of the Government of Sri Lanka. It does not seek to depart from its previous commitments, made with all gravitas to the international community, by one jot or tittle. On the contrary, its reaffirms in full all its commitments, and makes only the tame plea for a further two years for complete delivery on all its pledges. Furthermore, it specifically confers on the High Commissioner for Human Rights a wide-ranging supervisory authority. This Resolution requests the Office of the High Commissioner to continue to assess progress on the implementation of its recommendations and other relevant processes related to reconciliation, accountability and human rights in Sri Lanka (Para 4).
Again, it is difficult to imagine a clearer antithesis to independent, nationally oriented derision making and implementing power exercised by a sovereign Government.

IV. The High Commissioners Conception of His Role in Relation to Sri Lanka
UNHR Chief at the time, Prince Zeid Raad Al Hussein, was quite categorical in his statements defining his role vis--vis our country, with total acquiescence and indeed encouragement at every point, by the Government of Sri Lanka.
He declared: The report and the Human Rights Council Resolution suggest international participation in the accountability mechanisms set up to deal with international crimes and gross human rights violations (Statement to the Council on 9 February 2016). He enjoyed the strongest support of the President and the Prime Minister of Sri Lanka. As part of the same Statement, Prince Al-Hussein asserted: I was reassured this morning to hear both the President and the Prime Minister state their firm conviction in this regard.
Four months later, the High Commissioner stated: I remain convinced that international participation in the accountability mechanisms, as stipulated in the Human Rights Councils Resolution, would be a necessary guarantee for the credibility, independence and impartiality of the process (Statement to the Council on 29 June 2016).

The Resolution welcomes and encourages the positive engagement between the Govt of Sri Lanka and the High Commissioner and the Office of the HC of Human Rights

The High Commissioner was particularly explicit in his attitude to war crimes allegations against Sri Lankas Armed Forces. In the following year, he commented in his statement to the Council: The consistent failure to effectively investigate, prosecute and punish serious crimes appears to reflect a broader reluctance or fear to take action against members of the security forces. Combined with a general lack of trust in the impartiality of the justice system regarding past violations, this continuing unwillingness or inability to address impunity reinforces the need for international participation in a judicial mechanism .. For this to be credible, it should include a special counsel, foreign judges and defence lawyers, and authorized prosecutors and investigators (Statement on March 22, 2017).
What is truly remarkable, however, is the vigorous support extended at all times to these postures by the Government of Sri Lanka. In his Statement of February 9, 2016, the High Commissioner, having baldly asserted that The countrys history over the past few decades is littered with judicial failures, went on to add: The Prime Minister commented on it at great length, and with admirable candour, during a January 27 debate in Parliament. It is much too late in the day to reverse these disastrous trends.

V. Contrasting Approaches Asserting National Sovereignty
In sharp contrast with the diffident and submissive attitudes underpinning the behaviour of Sri Lankan leaders, representatives of the current Administration of the United States of America at the 73rd Session of the UNGA, struck a different note altogether.
President Donald Trump, who took the floor on September 25, the day on which President Sirisena delivered his address, made no apology for a defiant articulation of his policy: America is governed by Americans. We reject the ideology of globalism, and we embrace the doctrine of patriotism. Around the world, responsible nations must defend against threats to sovereignty, not just from global governance, but also from other, new forms of coercion and domination.
A key official in his Administration, John Bolton, was devastatingly scathing in his denunciation of self-styled global governance. He had this trenchant comment to make in New York on September 10 this year: This Administration will fight back to protect American constitutionalism, our sovereignty and our citizens. No committee of foreign nations will tell us how to govern ourselves and defend our freedom.
While the Government of Sri Lanka belatedly laments foreign influence and threats, here is a sharply contrasting robust rejection of capitulation. Bolton minced no words in defining the Trump Administrations policy with regard to the International Criminal Court: We will not co-operate with the ICC. We will provide no assistance to the ICC. We will not join the ICC. We will let the ICC die on its own. After all, for all intents and purposes, the ICC is already dead.
It must not be forgotten that the United States, having co-sponsored the Resolution against Sri Lanka, subsequently relinquished its membership of the Human Rights Council. In doing so, its representatives characterized the Council as a cess pool riddled with hypocrisy, double standards and self-serving motivations. The U.S. has now withdrawn from the Council, but Resolutions 30/1 and 34/1 still remain valid and binding, and Sri Lanka has to abide by the consequences. Tragically, co-sponsorship of these Resolutions by the Government of Sri Lanka itself effectively silenced a considerable swath of the globe which, until then, had steadfastly stood for, and staunchly defended, our countrys independence and sovereignty.

VI. Conclusion
The co-sponsorship of the Resolutions of 2015 and 2017 by the Government of Sri Lanka itself makes the Resolutions intrinsically distinct from Resolutions sponsored at the HRC by a foreign State. This circumstance signifies that the Resolutions are emblematic of the intent and stance of the Government of Sri Lanka: foreign involvement and collaboration are essential for post-war reconstruction and reconciliation. A domestic and autochthonous process was deliberately and repeatedly eschewed during the last three years in favour of the former. That this collaboration is all-pervasive is explicitly indicated by the all-encompassing language of the Resolutions which contemplate core domestic issues including constitutional reforms, devolution of power, defence and public security restructuring, and alienation of State land  matters within the exclusive purview of the Parliament of Sri Lanka.
The far-reaching implications of the involvement of the international community in each of these matters necessarily means that the Government of Sri Lanka intended and adopted the position that it is incompetent or unable to exercise its sovereign powers and capacity to steer the nation on its own, and required external intervention even in respect of matters admittedly fundamental to the spirit of the nation. This is further buttressed by the Prime Ministers own statement in Parliament impeaching the credibility and independence of Sri Lankas judicial system, which was strongly relied upon by the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights in his justification for international participation in the proposed accountability mechanism.
In surrendering the States sovereign right to chart the course of its post-war future, the Government of Sri Lanka alienated its mandate to nations whose representatives, at the very same session of the United Nations General Assembly, emphasized in uncompromising terms the precedence of patriotism over globalism, and the paramount need for nations to withstand threats to sovereignty from purported global governance (vide the remarks of President Trump) and vowed to protect their own defence personnel from international or foreign scrutiny and prosecution, going so far as to threaten international institutions such as the International Criminal Court with dire sanctions, should such institutions pursue action against their military personnel (vide the speech by John Bolton, National Security Adviser of the United States).
I read President Sirisenas speech at UNGA with growing bewilderment, as I wondered whether co-sponsorship of the 2015 and 2017 HRC Resolutions was the work of his Government or that of some other entity wholly remote from, and entirely unconnected with, the Sirisena- Wickremesinghe Administration. The reason for my perplexity is the evident reality that speeches at UNGA in New York, however lofty in aspiration, have no inherent impact whatsoever on Resolutions, approved and adopted at the HRC in Geneva. They are mere straws in the wind. This is more so, when the country in question has sponsored the Resolutions and urged the rest of the world to give them unqualified support. No practical consequences of any kind flow from exhortations at the General Assembly, unless and until the Government of Sri Lanka takes concrete steps to withdraw its own substantive Resolutions, and initiates action to have them rescinded, at the Human Rights Council. This is the bottom line.

Five students suspended over Buddha statue
	
Five undergrads of the Jaffna University have filed a rights petition against the university authorities claiming that charges had been levelled against them alleging that they had attempted to place a Buddha Statue in a hostel of the University and for action taken against them to ban them from entering the University.
In their rights petition the claim that their fundamental rights have been infringed upon by this action of the University authorities.
V.S.D. Edirisinghe, V.A. Kasun Gayan, K.M.G.S. Udaya Kumara, S. Udaya Prasath and K.K.K.S. Kannangara are the five students who had filed this rights petition. They have mentioned nine persons including the Vice Chancellor of the Jaffna University Prof Rathnam Wigneshwaran, Dean of the Vavuniya Faculty Dr T. Mangaleswaran, the Chairman of the University Grants Commission, the Minister of Higher Education and the Attorney General as respondents.
The petitioners claim that a group including them had attempted to place a Buddha Statue in the Jaffna University Business Management and Human Resources faculty hostel in January this year. There had been no objection from the student community of the University, the petitioners allege, but however the University Authorities had leveled charges against them and imposed a ban on their entrance to the University.
They state further that due to this action they are unable to continue their studies and sit for the examinations.
The Petitioners point out that University authorities had allowed the LTTE sympathized Maha Viru commemorations and other commemorations to be held within the University and only imposed a Ban on them. They claim that with this decision taken by the Jaffna university Authorities, an infringement has been caused to the Fundamental Rights of individuals to profess a religion of their choice as guaranteed by the Constitution.
They plead the courts to declare that their fundamental rights have been infringed upon and to order the authorities to lift the ban made on them and allow them to attend sessions and sit for examinations. (Thilini De Silva and Ranjan Katugampola)

Holding PC elections: PM wants Govt. to take policy decision
	
At yesterday's Cabinet meeting, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe is known to have stressed the need for the government to take a policy decision on the conduct of the provincial council elections.
Political party representatives met last week to discuss this matter. The political parties, other than the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP), agreeing to conduct the elections under the previous proportional representation system. The SLFP insisted that the elections should be conducted under the new system -- a mix of the proportional representation system and the first-past-the post system.
The Prime Minister informed the Cabinet about the stance of the party leaders and pointed out that parliamentary approval was necessary to conduct elections under either of the electoral systems. (Kelum Bandara)

## Title: Hopeful of 4% growth this year: Central Bank

Hopeful of 4% growth this year: Central Bank
	
Sri Lankas Central Bank is hopeful that the island nations US $87 billion economy would grow at least 4 percent this year, despite both International Monetary Fund (IMF) and Asian Development Bank (ADB) revising down their growth forecasts to 3.8 percent recently.
Sri Lankas economy grew 3.6 percent in the first half. For the economy to achieve a 4 percent full year growth, it has to grow at least by 4.4 percent in the second half.
At the last meeting I said we could grow 4, for which we have to grow by 4.4 percent in the second half. I know that would be a stretch. But Im hopeful that we would grow 4 percent, Central Bank Governor Dr. Indrajit Coomaraswamy told reporters in Colombo yesterday.
With the recovery in agriculture sector and growth in both services and industry sectors that was witnessed during the second quarter, the Central Bank expects the economy to expand during the remaining quarters of the year at a rate higher than the first half of 2018.
Meanwhile, Governor Coomaraswamy noted that the rupee is stabilizing against the dollar as a result of the temporary measures taken recently to discourage consumption imports.
He said the Central Bank is striving for a competitive exchange rate and stressed that the current panic on the rupee depreciation against the US dollar is unwarranted.
I wonder whether we are living in a different country when I look at everything going around me. Why this panic People are saying everything is collapsing. But growth is increasing, inflation is in check and our foreign reserves are enough.
He further said the Central Bank has enough technical excellence to handle the current situation and loaded Finance and Mass Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera for his cooperation and assistance saying that, we cant have a better Finance Minister at this moment.
Governor Coomaraswamy urged that the global conditions have changed and moneys that flowed into emerging markets after the 2008 global financial crisis are now going back to advanced economies with the strengthening of the US economy.
He also noted that the global oil prices which remained low for an extended period are also now moving up.
In a surprising move yesterday the Central Bank in its 6th monetary policy review for this year kept the policy interest rates unchanged, despite many analysts betting that the monetary authority would increase rates in line with other Asian region economies such as India, Malaysia, Indonesia and Philippines.
The Monetary Board of the Central Bank kept the Standing Lending Facility Rate (SLFR) at 8.50 percent and Standing Deposit Facility Rate (SDFR) at 7.25 percent. The market had expected hikes for both.
Explaining the key reasons behind the Monetary Boards decision, Governor Coomaraswamy said Sri Lanka already has higher nominal and real interest rates compared to some of the countries who had raised interest rates at least a couple of times during this year.
Relatively slower growth, moderating money supply and credit growth, contained inflation and tight liquidity conditions were cited as the key reasons behind the policy decision.
Those economies have higher growth and they also have lower nominal and real interest rates. We already have a greater tightening bias compared to a lot of countries, he said.
Further justifying the Monetary Boards decision to hold on to the policy rates, Governor Coomaraswamy said at this juncture a rate increase would not have either brought in new money into the country or encourage investors, who are already here, to stay.
In the current conditions, where there is money moving out of the emerging markets, given that Sri Lanka is a twin deficit country, chances of Sri Lanka attracting new money are very low.
Then you have to ask whether can we keep the people who are already here by increasing rates We have US $ 1.5 billion worth of institutional investments in rupee securities at the moment. By increasing interest rates will we encourage those people to stay here The answer to that is also no.
Because we will impose mark to market losses on those people and they will be incentivized to leave.
Sri Lanka on a net basis has spent US $ 184 million so far this year to defend the rupee and the rupee against the dollar to date has depreciated 9.7 percent.
Sri Lanka burnt over US $ 3 billion by unsuccessfully trying to defend the rupee in 2015 and another US $ 4.1 billion in 2011-2012, which ultimately ended up in the country seeking IMF assistance.
So, this is a better package than what was introduced earlier, Governor Coomaraswamy said.
Sri Lankas foreign reserves currently stand around US $ 7.3 billion and the Central Bank expects to end the year with US $ 8.3 billion, down from the earlier target of US $ 9 billion.
Plans sovereign bond issue this year
Sri Lanka may go for an International Sovereign Bond (ISB) issue before the end of this year on top of the plans to raise US $ 500 million through Panda and Samurai bonds.
Central Bank Governor Dr. Indrajit Coomaraswamy said the Central Bank wants to go for the ISB as early as possible before the interest rates go up any further.
Sri Lanka will also be receiving US $ 1 billion from the China Development Bank as a syndicated loan in a couple of weeks time, and the Central Bank may look at upsizing the loan to US $ 1.5 billion, given the attractive 5.25 percent interest rates attached to the loan.
Mirror Business a couple of weeks ago exclusively reported Central Banks plans to raise US $ 250 million through a Panda bond issuance with the assistance of Peoples Bank of China before the end of this year.
The Central Bank is expected to call for expressions of interest to appoint lead managers to the issue shortly.
Japan Bank for International Corporation (JBIC) backed US $ 250 million Samurai bond issue will most likely to be issued early next year. (Indika Sakalasooriya )

Indonesia is hit by another powerful earthquake
	

Indonesia has been struck by another earthquake just days after a deadly tsunami, which was sparked by a major quake. 
The magnitude 5.9 earthquake was recorded near the southern Indonesian island of Flores on Tuesday, the U.S. Geological Survey said. 
There were no immediate tsunami alerts or reports of casualties or damage. 
Flores is about 1600km south of Sulawesi island where just four days ago a devastating 7.5 quake struck, triggering the devastating tsunami. 
At least 844 people were killed, with families being forced to comb through body bags in an attempt to identify their missing relatives. 
The death-toll is expected to rise as authorities reach areas that were cut off by the disaster. 
Nearly 50,000 people have been displaced from their homes in Palu alone, and hospitals were overwhelmed. 
Rescuers have been searching for people through the ruins in Palu, the main city where the brunt of the damage happened. 
The quake triggered tsunami waves as high as six metres on Friday that smashed into the citys beachfront, about 2 km from the hotel. About 12 people have been recovered from the ruins of the hotel, three of them alive. 
Indonesia has said it would accept offers of international aid, having shunned outside help earlier this year when an earthquake struck the island of Lombok. 
Power has yet to be restored in the area and access by land to outlying villages has been disrupted by broken roads, landslides and downed bridges.

REUTERS, 02nd OCTOBER, 2018 - Robert Lighthizer was the public face of arduous, year-long talks to rework NAFTA, but as he savored a successful conclusion in the White House Rose Garden on Monday, the U.S. trade representative singled out another man as the deals architect.
Ive said before, and Ill say again, this agreement would not have happened if it wasnt for Jared, Lighthizer told reporters.
The 70-year-old veteran negotiator was referring to Jared Kushner, more than 30 years his junior and Donald Trumps son-in-law, whom the president had asked to help out on trade early in the presidency, especially on Canada and Mexico. While Kushners time in the White House has been turbulent - Chief of Staff John Kelly temporarily stripped him of his security clearance earlier this year and he has been criticized for his dealings with the Middle East - his role in keeping the North American Trade Agreement afloat was fundamental, multiple sources said.

Mahathirs counter-point  and our radicalisation project
	
Counter terror laws empower perpetrators to crush this legitimate resistance. Likewise, the problem of terrorism cannot be resolved without coming to terms with its drivers
	
	Todays weapons cost millions. Fighter jets cost about 100 million dollars. And maintaining them cost tens of millions. But the poor countries are persuaded to buy them even if they cannot afford

A popular newspaper column lamented on Sunday (September 30) that while the punishment for murder is death upon conviction, the punishment for the murder of hundreds, i.e. a terrorist act, is only life imprisonment. Taking a critical stance of the recently Cabinet-approved counter terrorism bill for apparently soft-pedalling the issue of terrorism, the columnist opined that it allows a mass terrorist bomber to get away with murder most foul.
And yet, isnt it even more ironic that when one man is killed, it is murder, and when a million are killed, it is deemed a heroic act A cause for celebration This was the powerful counter-point conveyed at the United Nations by Malaysias Premier Dr. Mahathir Mohamed who at 93, is the Elder Statesman of Asia and remains deeply loved and respected by not just Malaysians, but by millions across the globe. Indeed, there is something wrong with the universally propagated way of thinking and with our value system, as the Malaysian PM so candidly put it, when he addressed the 73rd session of the UN General Assembly on September 29.
In the Sri Lankan context, the question that is not being raised yet  not loudly enough at least  by civil society is why do we need to enact fresh laws to deal with terrorism at this juncture What is the justification Everyone thought the war was over. Why are we then planning to enact laws to counter terror Whose terror Is that the right message for the foreign investors already on the run Are the existing criminal laws not adequate Is there fear mongering of far-fetched threats to justify the privileges certain institutions wish to continue to enjoy, even while some in this country are living or dying () on Murunga leaves Without doubt, we should do away with the Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA) altogether. So many have been locked up without sufficient evidence and their lives wrecked. Some of them had never heard of at least rehabilitation! 
There are cases of suspects spending nearly 10 years without a charge in remand prisons as recently reported in the media. Are we not investing in radicalizing them and others who do not support measures which they see as unjust While the PTA should be done away with, who is asking for a special law in this country to deal exclusively with terrorism especially at a time when Sri Lanka is enjoying relative (negative) peace since the war ended in May 2009.Illang Kanawa- you ask for it and you will get it!
What is equally perturbing is the colossal amount that is being earmarked for Defence expenditure. According to the Appropriation Bill for 2019, as reported in the Sunday newspapers, budgetary allocation for Defence will shoot to over Rs. 306 billion, up from Rs. 290 billion in 2018, whereas just Rs. 6.1 billion has been allocated to the very important subject of National Integration, Reconciliation and Official Languages. From the Rs. 306 billion, it is reported that Rs. 275 billion will go towards recurrent expenditure and Rs. 32 billion will be utilized for capital expenditure.
According to a report published in February this year by Strategic Defence Intelligence, which provides early market intelligence for the global arms industry, Sri Lankas defence spending will reach USD 2 billion by 2023, with a compound annual growth rate of 1.71% over the next five years. The report entitled Future of the Sri Lankan Defence Industry  Market Attractiveness, Competitive Landscape and Forecasts to 2023 anticipates that military imports will rise between 2019 and 2023.
Again, the question: why should military expenditure be on an upward trend in Sri Lanka, in the absence of a serious terrorist problem, and at a time, when we are neck-deep in debt running into trillions of rupees There is no justification for such a bloated military budget; money that would be better spent on poverty alleviation, education, housing, roads and yes  peace-building. Why is Sri Lankas civil society silent
Dr. Mahathir Mohamed succinctly summed up the crudity of big capital at the UN last week when he stated: The arms business is now the biggest business in the world. They profit shamelessly from the deaths and destruction they cause. Indeed, so-called peace-loving countries often promote this shameful business. Todays weapons cost millions. Fighter jets cost about 100 million dollars. And maintaining them cost tens of millions. But the poor countries are persuaded to buy them even if they cannot afford. They are told their neighbours or their enemies have them. It is imperative that they too have them. While their people starve and suffer from all kinds of deprivations, a huge percentage of their budget is allocated to the purchase of arms. That their buyers may never have to use them bothers the purveyors not at all.
If we understand the root causes of terrorism and seek to address those causes in earnest, we need not worry unduly about the resurgence of terrorism in this country. The ugly acts of harming innocent civilians can never be condoned, irrespective of the attire of the agent. The crux of terrorism is the intimidation and /or harm to a civilian population, when resistance becomes the legitimate response. 
Counter terror laws empower perpetrators to crush this legitimate resistance. Likewise, the problem of terrorism cannot be resolved without coming to terms with its drivers. That requires a broad mind-set; a mind-set that is ready to look beyond the legal framework, and into the hearts and minds of the people. 
The arrest and detention of Sri Lankan Kamer Nizamdeen on flimsy grounds by the New South Wales Police in Australia, is a reminder to us all of how counter terror laws can be used to harass and intimidate people on the basis of their race and/or religion. The laws can and have been invoked to terrorize innocent people and cause untold agony. Do we really need such laws in this country Are these the international best practices we wish to emulate
Despite being told otherwise, Sri Lanka showed the world in May 2009 that a military victory over terrorism was possible. The foreign and local pundits were proved wrong. Now they demand laws to prevent a resurgence of terrorist activity. It is time to prove them wrong again. 
Little Sri Lanka can show the big world that we do not need harsh, repressive laws that can potentially harm the liberties of our citizens to address imagined security threats. If we showed the world our military might in 2009, then a decade later we can show the world our humane face, by putting into practice the compassion espoused in the noble religion of the Gautama Buddha professed by the majority in this land and the teachings of every religious leader. We need justice and political solutions; not laws that would be counter-productive and further polarize our regrettably fragmented society.

The Criminal Investigation Department had commenced recording statements in connection with the New York Times report which alleged that a Chinese company had funded the campaign of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa in January 2015.
Following the New York Times article, the National Movement of Web Journalists had lodge a complaint with the Police Financial Crimes Investigation Division (FCID) on June 29 requesting conduct and inquiry into the allegation.
The investigation into the complaint was then handed over to the CID.
Accordingly, the CID had summoned the Chairman of the National Movement of Web Journalists to record a statement over the complaint this morning.
The New York Times reported that at least US$7.6 million was dispensed from China Harbours account at Standard Chartered Bank to affiliates of Mr. Rajapaksas campaign.
The article published by Maria Abi-Habib of The New York Times said though Chinese officials and analysts had insisted that Chinas interest in the Hambantota Port was purely commercial, Sri Lankan officials said from the start, the intelligence and strategic possibilities of the ports location were part of the negotiations.(Darshana Sanjeewa)

Over 250 worldwide died taking selfies: Study
	
More than 250 people worldwide have died while taking selfies in the last six years, the NDTV reported today quoting a study conducted by the researchers of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences.
The findings, which analyzed news reports of the 259 selfie-related deaths from October 2011 to November 2017, were published in the July-August edition of the Journal of Family Medicine and Primary Care.
Of the 259 deaths, researchers found the leading cause to be drowning, followed by incidents, involving transportation - for example, taking a selfie in front of an oncoming train - and falling from heights. Other causes of selfie-related death include animals, firearms and electrocution.
"The selfie deaths have become a major public health problem," Agam Bansal, the study's lead author has told The Washington Post.
Though the study found India to have the highest number of deaths of all countries, numerous reports of fatal selfie incidents have also come from Russia, the US and Pakistan. Bansal noted that while the simple act of taking a selfie isn't deadly, the hazard arises when people take risks while trying to get that perfect shot.
"If you're just standing, simply taking it with a celebrity or something, that's not harmful," he said. "But if that selfie is accompanied with risky behavior then that's what makes the selfies dangerous."
"Taking a toll on these many numbers just because you want a perfect selfie because you want a lot of likes, shares on Facebook, Twitter or other social media, I don't think this is worth compromising a life for such a thing, Bansal said.
Bansal added he was also concerned about how many of the selfie-related fatalities involved young people. More than 85 percent of the victims were between the ages of 10 and 30, Bansal said.
"They form the future of a nation. They haven't even realized what their goals are. They aren't even sure what they want to do. They're just beginners in their lives," Bansal said.
While the number of deaths reported in the study may seem high, Bansal said there could be many more cases that just haven't been documented due to issues with reporting.
One possible way to prevent selfie deaths would be "no selfie zones," Bansal said, banning them in certain areas such as water bodies, mountain peaks, and at the top of tall buildings."
Efforts to dissuade people from taking dangerous selfies has already been attempted in multiple countries, including India, Russia and Indonesia.

Peace treaty no bargaining chip for denuclearisation
	

SEOUL AFP Oct2, 2018-North Korea on Tuesday ruled out dismantling its nuclear arsenal in exchange for the US declaring an end to the Korean War, saying a peace treaty should never be a bargaining chip. The North has for decades demanded that the US formally declare the end of the 1950-53 conflict that was halted only with an armistice, saying an official end to the war would ease tensions on the flash-point peninsula.

At a summit with the Souths President Moon Jae-in last month, the Norths leader Kim Jong Un offered to shut down its main Yongbyon nuclear complex if Washington takes corresponding measures. 
Kim did not elaborate on what those measure might be, but state news agency KCNA said in a commentary that some US experts have suggested trading the end of the war for denuclearisation. 
It flatly described that as only the most basic... process to restore ties, not a point for negotiation. 
The end of war... is not just a gift from a man to another at all. Furthermore, it can never be a bargaining chip for getting the DPRK denuclearised, it said, using the Norths full name.

Portfolio for Ravi K only if AG clears him: UNP
	
United National Party (UNP) seniors have decided that MP Ravi Karunanayake will be given a ministerial portfolio only after Attorney General clear him of any charges, informed sources said yesterday.
Party seniors have met last evening to discuss the matter and other political issues including the provincial council elections which is to be held next year.
It was reported earlier that President Maithripala Sirisena has decided to have a Cabinet reshuffle where it is expected that both Mr. Karunanayake and MP Dayasiri Jayaskera will be appointed as Cabinet ministers.
The party seniors have been of the opinion that attorney general should be asked to come up with a definite decision on Mr. Karunanayake.
Meanwhile UNP Spokesman Minister Harin Fernando told a media briefing earlier during the day that Attorney general should come up with a definite stand on MP Karunanayake and clear him if there are no charges or file action if necessary.  It is unfair by Mr. Karunanayake if the Attorney General drags the issue without taking action against him or clearing him if there are no charges. Mr. Karunanayake has been cornered by the media as well, Mr. Fernando said. (Yohan Perera)

Prez berates IGP
	
Amid mounting criticism of the police, President Maithripala Sirisena is reported to have berated Police Chief Pujith Jayasundara at yesterdays Cabinet meeting even calling his behaviour unbecoming of his post.
It has come in the wake of Higher Education Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe reportedly raising concern with regard to the increasing number of crimes in the country.
However, Law and Order Minister Ranjith Madduma Bandara had pointed out that according to available statistices the crime rate had dropped though the media was claiming otherwise.
The President had intervened saying whatever anyone might say, the Police Service had deteriorated in terms of its performance and highlighted the fact that the entire police service including the Police Chief should be reformed without delay.
He said he and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe had been embarrassed by the Police Chief's actions.
The President levelled these allegations against the Police Chief at a time when investigations were in progress regarding an alleged plot to assassinate him and former defence secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa. (Kelum Bandara)

Rebels under close watch!
	

The former Green party secretarial one, reduced to a nonentity following his miscalculated somersault, however, is not a politico prepared to go into oblivion.

He is reportedly busy these days meeting like-minded people and holding discussions to launch a new political party. He is said to be making overtures to his former Green colleagues, especially those known to be carrying a chip on their shoulder.
The Green high-ups who had received intelligence about the former secretarial ones persistent bid to hook a few unhappy Green bucks have now deployed several spies to monitor the movements of the party rebels, they say.
Meanwhile, the Green backbenchers who have come to know that they are under close watch are nowadays being careful not to answer a call from the former secretarial one or to be seen anywhere he is present for that matter. Among these wary backbenchers are also the radicals who had once looked set to wage a do-or-die battle against the party chief, they say.

## Title: SAITM ruling covers all

SAITM ruling covers all
	
The Supreme Court has put an end to a three year long wrangling and all controversies over the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM) by accepting the plea by one of the students graduated by the institute to be provisionally registered with the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC).
Needless to say it is a judgment not only on the petition filed by Malshani Sooriyaarachchi to be provisionally registered, rather it is a judgment on the standard of the SAITM, which was abolished by the government under pressure by the medical students and the doctors of the Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA). And also it is a judgment on the acceptability of the private higher education in the country.
It was reported over the weekend that the SLMC in a strange move had decided to inform the student in question to apply for the provisional registration, even after the Supreme Court had ruled that she must be registered accepting her application to the SLMC tendered in 2016. She had met every requirement under the Medical Ordinance to be registered with the SLMC, as indicated by the highest court of the country.
Medical Ordinance cites two prerequisites for the provisional registration of MBBS degree holders as medical practitioners. One is the good character while the other being a degree from an accepted degree awarding institute, here or abroad. And it is the first of the three steps of registration of medical practitioners, with the SLMC.
The ruling by the Supreme Court is a clear indication that the said MBBS graduate of the SAITM has fulfilled both the requirements. Malshanis character has never been in question and it was the standard of the SAITM that was challenged by the adversaries of the private medical college in Malabe. One cannot doubt whether the Appeal Court which heard the case and gave a ruling in favour of Malshani first and the Supreme Court that upheld the Appeal Court ruling later had looked into the standards and the competence of the SAITM as a degree awarding institute.
But, alas! When the Supreme Court, through its ruling, had given the message to the thousands of aspirant of medical profession who were not selected to the State medical faculties that there is an accepted private medical college in the country, that medical college had been abolished by the law. Some of those aspirants are prepared to go to foreign universities, spending tens of thousands of sky rocketing dollars.
The Supreme Courts observation on the government decision to award MBBS degree of the General Sir John Kotelawala Defence University (KDU) to the SAITM students is interesting and very important. It says: These steps were taken by the government and the enactment of aforesaid statute, all occurred, long after the petitioner filed her application in the Court of Appeal and also long after the SLMC filed an application in the court seeking this special leave to appeal from the order of the Court of Appeal
This observation would help the government which is in a fix now as to how to deal with the issue as the ruling has accepted the SAITM degree while it had made arrangements to award KDU degrees to the SAITM students. And also the observation of the Supreme Court can be deemed as questioning by the court, the propriety of the government decision to transfer the SAITM students to KDU.
Now that the highest court of the country has accepted the standard of the medical college that awarded the MBBS degree to Malshani Sooriyaarachchi, what would be the response of the Higher Education Ministry and the University Grants Commission (UGC) if the authorities of the SAITM sought the revival of the institute with the same standards
The opposition to the SAITM has always been politically motivated. It was evident by the silence by some of the adversaries of the private medical college when the former government assisted it with loans and scholarships. Ridiculously, those leaders of the former government who strengthened the private medical college at Malabe also turned against it when they fell from grace. The student unions that fought against the institute, delaying the degree of a whole batch of medical students had been indoctrinated with Marxism which does not recognize privatization. Ludicrously all these people accepted and recognized those degree holders from the foreign universities. It is time for all to think afresh in the light of the Supreme Court ruling.

Sergeant who went berserk arrested with service weapon
	
The entire Thebuwana Town in the Kalutara District was engulfed with fear this afternoon when an enraged police sergeant armed with a T-56 assault rifle took to the streets protesting in a violent manner for letting a driver of a lorry transporting sand, who was arrested by him recently, go scot-free allegedly on the orders of the police hierachy.
The sergeant, attached to the Thebuwana Police Station, was furious to learn that the lorry driver he arrested on September 29th for transporting sand sans a permit, was not going to be produced in court yesterday as scheduled. He had then grabbed his service T-56 rifle and started behaving in a violent manner.
Senior police officials, including Kalutara Division SSP Upul Nilmini Ariyaratne, who rushed to the scene, attempted to pacify the irate policeman in a drama that unfolded for two hours while traffic was at its peak following the closure of schools in the afternoon.
The Police Special Task Force (STF) had to be called in as the senior police officers on hand were unable to persuade the protesting sergeant to put down his weapon.
The sergeant's daughter, who had been returning home after school, who happened to pass by had rushed to the scene while his wife too had come to the area and tried to pacify him as well but to no avail.
However, while his attention was diverted by something else two of the STF personnel, who had been brought clad in plain clothing, had managed to overpower him. During the struggle that ensued the sergeant had managed to pull the trigger twice releasing two rounds of fire into the air, frightening a number of persons in the vicinity, yet hurting no one.
He was soon taken into custody along with the weapon he had with him.
The sergeant alleged that the lorry which had been seized by him for transporting sand by violating its permit conditions had been released under the discretion of the Thebuwana Police Officer In Charge (OIC) for some unknown reason.
The suspects taken into custody along with the lorry on September 29, were to be produced in court yesterday (3). He got annoyed after he got to know that the suspects were not produced before court.
SSP Kalutara Division however said that the OIC had released the lorry after checking that the relevant documents and permits were valid. The sergeant is due to be produced in court today (4). (By Sunil S. Thanthriarachchi, Bimal Shyaman Jayasinghe, Thusitha Kumara De Silva and Bandu Thambavita)

Singing away to a business degree
	
Educationists in Sri Lanka in collaboration with Australia present a golden opportunity for school leavers to study music and business as a degree

The education authorities in Sri Lanka have presented an opportunity for school leavers to enroll for a degree programme which has music and business as the two subjects. The media was briefed about the programme at a conference held recently during which Gateway Graduate School Chairman Dr. Harsha Alles (fourth from left), Founder and Music Director of Souls Sounds Academy Soundarie David Rodrigo (Third from left) and Professor Ingrid Day, a representative of University of Adelaide (Fifth from left) spoke.

The Gateway Graduate School and Soul Sounds Academy in collaboration with the University of Adelaide, Australia are presenting students with a novel opportunity to study both business and music as an undergraduate degree. To honour this collaboration an MOU was signed on September 20. Finally those who have dreamed of pursuing music for their higher studies have the opportunity to study it with business at one of the top ranked universities in the world. Their first year of studies will take place in Sri Lanka and on successful completion of this phase, students will receive an international diploma in business and will also qualify to go into the second year of undergraduate studies at the university of Adelaide, whereby they will be able to complete a degree in business and music. 
Gateway Graduate School Chairman Dr. Harsha Alles spoke at length about this unique opportunity. This partnership is not only important to art students, but it is also something that is very special to Sri Lanka. This is because we are trying to do something new with regard to the entire syllabus. It has been designed and planned to make sure that we try our very best for Sri Lankan students to move away from traditional educational practices and rather pursue their passion through education. To make a change and do something different I believe it must start from the top, from the people who are driving education in this country, said Dr. Alles. 

Business as a major
He spoke on how the degree programme would be conducted. The business and music degree programme is arranged as such that it will begin in Sri Lanka where students are able to do an international diploma in business at Gateway Graduate School. The music modules, which are part of the diploma, will be conducted by Soul Sounds Academy. After the students finish their modules in business and music in Sri Lanka, they would be able to join the second year of the degree programme at the university of Adelaide in Australia. They will have to do business as a major and music as a minor at Adelaide University. I sincerely hope this would be the start of such opportunities opening up in Sri Lanka, because there are so many passionate and talented students in Sri Lanka who do not have a structured and formal path to pursue their passion, he added. 
He spoke on how this initiative truly began. It all started a few months ago with a phone call from Soundarie David and she asked if we can collaborate together . We both actually come from completely different backgrounds, I am a medic by profession, but I pursued a path in being an educationalist and Soundarie is a qualified lawyer, but she pursued her passion in music. We both share similar goals and that is to build pathways for students to follow their true passion rather than pursue what they are expected to. We both believe that education can be delivered in a way where students enjoy their learning, he said. 
He added, Soundaries concern was that there is a growing number of students who are interested in pursuing music, but we can see that many of them finish their music education when they finish school. It is however, quite difficult to convince parents to allow their children to pursue a path in the humanities, because many of them believe that their children should qualify as either doctors, lawyers or engineers. This initiative was in fact a way to allow students to pursue their academics while engaging in their passions as well. When we had this discussion we believed we should contact a university in Australia. 
I visited University of Adelaide and I have to say that I was truly taken aback from the beauty of the city and the culture of the university. It is the third oldest university in Australia and is among the top 8 universities in Australasia (G8) and it is part of the top 100 universities in the world. Hence, it is part of the top 1%, he said. 

Soundaries story
Soundarie David Rodrigo, founder and music director of Souls Sounds Academy said, This is the first time in Sri Lanka where there has been a collaboration in music and business. The reason why I truly wanted such an opportunity created is because of my own experience. When I finished school I was selected to the Law Faculty of Colombo. Though I wanted to be a lawyer, my passion for music was always within me. I had to work very hard at the Faculty of Law in order to enter The Royal School of Music in England to complete my education in music. It took me a long time to finish both, but I did not give up because I did not want to give up either law nor music. 
I am happy that now through this collaboration with Gateway Graduate School and University of Adelaide that we are able to create a pathway for talented students to balance both their music and traditional academic education,she said. 

After the students finish their modules in business and music in Sri Lanka, they would be able to join the second year of the degree programme at the university of Adelaidein Australia

She also spoke about Sri Lankas education system and the attitude towards it. I think it should be noted that there is much pressure coming from parents making children follow a career in either law, medicine, commerce or engineering. It has become so competitive that even my grade 5 students stop all their extra curricular activities when examinations are around the corner. This is the kind of culture and mentality that perpetuates in our country. We must change this mindset. Though this is for school leavers I believe it is an initiative in changing this mindset. explained David. 
Gateway Graduate School CEO Prashanth Chanmugam said, The business diploma is internationally accredited. The degree and diploma programmes follow a practical framework where students can pursue their traditional academics and their passion in the humanities. The diploma will be similar to the first year of the undergraduate programme offered by the university of Adelaide,said Chanmugam. 
Professor Ingrid Day, a representative of University of Adelaide, elaborated about the university. I believe this is an important partnership between the Gateway Graduate School, Soul Sounds Academy and Sri Lanka as a whole. It is also an important partnership between music and business, because I believe this is rather a unique degree programme. University of Adelaide is a prestigious university and the city of Adelaide is quite affordable in contrast to Melbourne and Sydney. 


We offer a range of subjects such as economics, finance, management, marketing, international business, general commerce and corporate finance. Our university also focuses on developing the soft skills of the students which is truly indispensable and lacking in the corporate world. Technology handles much of the technical work load of employees, but soft skills can never be replaced by technology. We want to mould students to be leaders, communicators, innovators and team players and I truly believe that having a humanity such as music as a minor would greatly enhance the personality and the vibrancy of the students and thereby make them more appealing to the job sector,said Day. 
Prof. A. M. Abeysekera, former Dean of the Faculty of Applied Science at Sri Jayewardenepura and Conductor of the Symphony Orchestra of Sri Lanka, said,  I am very delighted that such an initiative is being taken by the organisations. I feel that our education system is very rigid. For instance if one wants to pursue sciences, he would be only confined to that stream. We have a very narrow perspective regarding education, which adversely affects the mindset of students. Our education has changed and certificates and qualifications are regarded as the most important,said Abeysekera. 
He also added that collaborating music and business would facilitate those who are interested in making a career in music and added that knowledge in both fields are required to be successful in the industry.

## Title: Three years of breathing space, alright; but is that all
## Section: Opinion

Three years of breathing space, alright; but is that all
	
Waiting is the great vocation of the dispossessed.
- Mary Gordon-

A series of media advertisements for the Yahapalana government say their reign of three years has given some breathing space for the populace (husma gath wasara thunak). Technically the Government came to power in August 2015 when the UNP formed a quaint alliance with the SLFP, yet politically it is neither correct nor ethical to say that this regime is only three years as opposed to 3 years and another 8 months starting the count from January 8, 2015. Given the momentum of the tremendous victory of ousting the former strongman who made history as a conqueror of the LTTE menace, the political power was undeniably with the new President and the PM even though the numbers in Parliament remained the same till the General Elections in August. Besides when taking credit for the 19th Amendment, the government has no qualms of appropriating the credit all to themselves which actually was enacted prior to the General elections which were held in August that year.
But that is beside the point; some cynics sneeringly declare that it is only husma or breath that the present government has to show; the slogan itself conceding their inefficiency and incapability to offer anything tangible to the people who ushered in change by removing the Rajapaksa Cabal. On the other extreme, the yahapalana apologists say that allowing civil liberties without the authoritarian bearing in on all facets of life as the Rajapaksas did as well as pruning down powers of the executive and expanding democratic dialogue itself were testimony to the positives.

Critics and Apologists
I believe both the critics as well as the apologists have valid points. The record of the previous regime in ridding the country of terrorism and achieving economic progress through huge infrastructure development projects during which period the nation crossed the border from a poor to a low middle income country, deserves commendation. Yet the corruption, nepotism, impunity and lawlessness that under-ran all such efforts ate in to all plus points on their score sheet; The putrid socio economic and political culture they nurtured permeated all facets of life.
That the society was rotting within while showing cosmetic progress, hardly needs arguing about. Racial disharmony reached new heights with violence aimed at racial and religious minorities. Any dissent was branded as being a mark of a traitor and the persecution of media to the point that even the so called private media shunned criticism of the regime; the disappearance and murder of journalists served as a caveat to others not to irk the regime.

When majority voter opted for regime change on Jan 8 and Aug 2015, it was hardly rapid economic progress or mega development they had in mind

An impending debt crisis threatening to gobble up the entire economy plus the pressure from the international community to be pinpointed on the regime at the UNHRC on allegations of grave human rights abuses during the final phase of the war, were hanging like the sword of Damocles, with time running out. The fateful decision to hold the Presidential Election prematurely was a result of this fear of the doomsday that seemed imminent to those in the inner circle of power, if not to those outside. It sounded an admission that the Cabals glory days were behind them.

Aspirations of January 8
Against such a backdrop, when the majority voter opted for regime change, first on January 8 and then in August 2015, it was hardly rapid economic progress or mega development they had in mind. In that sense, the Rajapaksa regime had done well; in fact one bogey being used to deter change in the elections being that it would bring to a crashing halt the rapid economic development drive that was in full swing, albeit under questionable conditions. People, did in fact want a fresh breathing space, they were tired of the authoritarian, jingoistic and personality cult based rule that did short work of democratic and normative principle of governance.
The 19th Amendment introduced significant change in the way the governance was done in this country by curtailing the hitherto unbridled powers of the Executive Presidency, devolving them to independent commissions through the enlivening of a Constitutional Council decapitated by the previous regime. The democratic space expanded, media freedom saw new heights, trade unions were able to dictate terms to the rulers, the judiciary able to summon and punish even ruling coalition ministers, something unimaginable previously. In that sense the apologists are justified. But will it suffice...

People deserve more
Is that all the people who took a chance in removing a stable and strong regime with proven results in winning a war considered unwinnable and tangible and drastic economic achievements, to show for I think not.
They deserve more. Even if one forgoes the economic front, now a hackneyed rallying point for the opposition to attack it, it is obvious that this government could have done much more in crystallizing the aspirations of January 8 for a democratic, moral and ethical mode of living with the rule of law upheld. No, the people did not expect a Central Bank bond scam in the first place and any justification or playing down the repercussions of it on the national wealth in the second. No, they never foresaw a deal culture that not only leaves daylight robbers of public wealth Scot- free but even gives them ministerial portfolios, mocking the mandate of the people who effected change.

Democracy vs Prosperity
It is a fallacy to suggest that democratic space and rapid economic development are mutually exclusive and antithetical phenomena incapable of coexistence in a body politic. That indeed, is a mantra all authoritarian rulers incessantly chant to spook the masses. We have had democratically elected rulers since independence and have come this far. We would have done better if not for the corrupt and nauseating political culture that robbed us further progress. We do not need dictators or benevolent despots to guide us as a flock of sheep. At any rate the benevolent side of the so called dictators falls far short of their theatrics on the malevolent side!
We have shown that we can uphold parliamentary democracy, despite with setbacks; giving pure and simple breathing space is not to the satisfaction of the people of the country.
It is all good having breathing space; but that alone is not enough. We demand the assurance of equality and fairplay in all social aspects of life. The downtrodden masses expect social justice not the utopian neo-liberal laissez-faire model that turns a blind eye on the suffering of the common man. Granting breathing space is hardly a pretext why progressive and rapid economic change should not be aspired for, as that could well be the deciding factor in the next election.

Not too late
It was the people of this country who brought the coalition to power; who agitated for democratic space with strengthened civil society structures. With that mandate and momentum, this government could have broken ground both in terms of good governance and economy building. That is where the disappointment lies and the apologists hit a dead end!
Yes! We do concede being able to breathe freely; the credit goes to the coalition government. Yet we deserve much more than that. And they owe that duty to the people. The people still await; but their collective patience, too, has a limit!

TRYING TO BE DIFFERENT!!!
	

The tremendous pace at which development is progressing is incredible!!! Not a single stone is left unturned; they are going all out not just to impress but to start gaining much needed political mileage!!! Today, Birth, Marriage and Death Certificates can be obtained within minutes; Special Committees have been established to resolve payment issues, a massive programme is being carried out to renovate 1,000 tanks and Ministers are insisting that farmer insurance be given priority!!! Over Rs. 12 billion has been set aside for drought mitigation efforts and one wonders from where all these billions have suddenly surfaced!!!



Prison People
Moving on to the Scales of Justice, we find a daily trial has been set for Gamini Senarath and others, happily it has not been postponed as was done in most cases!!! However, Rangajeewa has been granted bail for allegedly killing 27 prisoners, with bail set at Rs. 100,000/- and two sureties of Rs. 200,000/- each!!! We can only hope that he too does not take off somewhere!!! They have not yet got down to the most basic essential of confiscating the passports of these criminals!!! The Prisons Commissioner Emil Ranjan is still languishing in jail and compelled to remain there until his revision application is considered!!!

Price and protests
Many protests are being voiced on price hikes, particularly the ones that hit the common man!!! Apparently, efforts are being made to look into unfair price hikes, but the private bus fare hike of Rs. 12/- remains unchanged and train fares will also go up!!! Likewise, a chew of betel is up by Rs. 10/- and the fuel and gas price hike remain unchanged, with Southern Provincial Councilors staging a colourful carrying protest!!! Strangely, Health and Education are to get Rs. 290 billion in 2019, with Defence, slotted to get the highest allocation!!! With the critical depreciation of the Rupee, where in the world are all these billions coming from We wonder!!!



Puswedilla
The tragic loss of lives in accidents is horrendous, most of which are due to carelessness and negligence of rules and regulations!!! It is so sad that children are orphaned, women widowed, whole families wiped out sometimes and all tragedies that could have been averted through a little caution and respect for law and order!!! Even animals like the poor elephants are prey to these ruthless reckless drivers who are totally unmindful of whom or what they kill or what they destroy!!! WHY ARENT WE LEVYING STRINGENT FINES FOR CARELESS DRIVING



IGP woes
It seems like our IGP does not know which God to tell; apparently, he is burning holes not incense in all the Devales, Kovils and Temples; worshipping at old ones, laying foundations for new ones while the circus goes on!!! Considering the crime rate in the country, the plots and schemes to assassinate, which have turned out to be other Puswedillas like the Janabalaya, we cannot actually blame the man for seeking divine assistance!!! Mr IGP, Difficulties in your life do not come to destroy you, but to help you realize your hidden potential; let difficulties know that YOU ARE DIFFICULT!!! When the going gets tough, the tough get going, didnt you know



Curbing imports
Whoever suggested that the further import of cars be banned should be given a Gold Medal!!! It may not be possible to impose a total ban, but let them at least levy a heavier duty on imported cars!!! After all, arent the Ministers themselves saying that LUXURIES SHOULD BE POSTPONED If this were ACTUALLY IMPLEMENTED, WE COULD REDUCE THE DEATH TOLL ON OUR ROADS, AND THE NEVER ENDING TRAFFIC SNARLS!!! ABOUT TIME THE AUTHORITIES TOOK DEFINITE ACTION ON THIS!!!


No one is exempt
Today I want to share something with you that I received and is well worth sharing!!! It is an evaluation of life, we come across the story of Formula 1 Michael Schumacher; when his story is studied as an athlete, we see that he was Winner of the Grand Prix in 1991, Seven times World Champion of Formula 1; his being was infused with happiness but one fateful day his destiny completely changed due to an accident!!! Today, this star with only 44 kilos of weight is struggling to survive since December 2013!!! His wife has started selling their goods to cover the expenses involved to keep him alive in a special room adapted in his house, where he lies like a vegetable!!! The question is Who is better than Who Life can take directions never imagined and amazingly everything can change in an instant!!! No one. And I mean no one is exempt from anything; what is more, Money, Titles, Fame, Success and Power are of no use in any of these circumstances!!! WE ARE ALL THE SAME, SO WHY THE PRIDE, WHY MAKE CLAIMS, WHY THE ARROGANCE, WHY SO MUCH ATTACHMENT TO MATERIAL GOODS ALL WE HAVE IS THE DAY, TODAY, SO LET US LIVE IT WITH PASSION AND ENJOY OURSELVES, DOING GOOD, SERVING OTHERS!!! We need to stop creating problems, to stop claiming insignificant things and always avoid everything that takes our lives!!! We need to be careful not to lose someone who loves us and accepts us as we are!!!
Like in the game of chess, in the end, both the King and the Pawn are kept in the same box!!! Isnt it worth examining what we have and have not done We are born with nothing, we die with nothing, but the sad thing is in real life, in the interval between life and death; we fight for what we did not bring and even more for what we will not take!!! So all you politicians and millionaires especially, think about living more, loving more, giving more and grabbing less!!! It is a very interesting reflection!!!

                                 THE VOICE
