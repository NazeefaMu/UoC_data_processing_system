Capital gains tax to be reintroduced
	
After taking stock of the economy in the backdrop of the uncertain global environment, the Cabinet, at a special meeting yesterday, approved new tax reforms including the introduction of Capital Gain Tax to arrest the gradual decline of state revenue.
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe submitted a paper at the special Cabinet meeting held in this regard with in-depth reference to the present status of economy. The tax reforms are also intended to generate resources to meet budgetary requirements.
As for the non corporate income tax and corporate tax, the Cabinet proposed to suspend the 2016 budgetary proposals and continue the rates introduced for 2015.
Asserting that Capital Gains had not been taxed since 1987, the government decided to reintroduce it. In the paper, it is observed that the last decades have seen massive gains in private capitals among the higher echelons of society.
Also, it is proposed to keep the Nation Building Tax at the rate of two per cent reversing the budgetary proposal to increase it to four per cent. Instead of having different rates of VAT, a single rate of 15 per cent is proposed. Besides, exemptions on telecommunications, private health and private education will be removed as proposed in the paper.
The government intends to increase its revenue to 13.5 percent of the GDP. The total expenditure and net lending will be at 19 per cent of GDP. The budget deficit is slated to drop to 5.4 per cent.
Parliament will be notified once a month on the progress of implementing these taxes. A three member committee including the Treasury Secretary will oversee the implementation of tax reforms. (Kelum Bandara)

Chief of Staff for parliament
	
A new post of Chief of Staff has been created in Parliament for the first time in its history with Deputy Secretary General Neil Iddawala being appointed to this post.
The Cabinet has approved the creation of the new post when it met on Wednesday with Prime Minister presenting a paper on behalf of Speaker Karu Jayasuriya.
Mr. Iddawala said the Cabinet had created the post in line with accepted procedure.
He said he would most probably be in charge of coordinating the staff though a job description was not prepared yet. Mr. Iddawala will function in his new post in addition to being the Deputy Secretary General of Parliament. However, he is yet to receive his letter of appointment.
This will be one of the few changes that are to be made with regard to Parliament in the wake of setting up oversight committees, proving office space for all MPs and handing over the Agriculture Ministry building to Parliament and eventually making it a part of the parliamentary complex.

## Title: IMF delegation due here by mid-March

IMF delegation due here by mid-March
	
Against the backdrop of increased liabilities of the government, a delegation of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) is due here by mid this month to carry out a forensic audit on the arrears and other liabilities of the government, it is learnt.
According to a Cabinet paper submitted by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe at the special meeting yesterday, the IMF has agreed to a request by the government to identify ways and means to manage the expenditure arrears.
The paper says the outstanding government debt remained at Rs. 8,475 billion by the end of last year. It accounts for 74.9 percent of the GDP.
Asserting that the State Owned Enterprises suffered horrendous losses during the previous regime, a significant amount of liabilities emerged after the preparation of the 2016 budget.
The Prime Minister says in his paper that the dire situation has forced the government to take strong policy measures to revive the loss making state enterprises.
Highlighting that the government could have coped up with the situation if not for the present crisis in the global economy, he says the government has to weather the situation.
"While our debt servicing payment have increased due to the contingent liabilities, the opportunity of servicing or refinancing the debt has become difficult due to the downturn of global economy," he says. He says the global situation will remain for one year due to the Presidential Election in the US and the referendum in the European Union.
The government observes in the paper that the drop in global fuel prices will result in the revenue drop of oil producing countries. Then, these countries lower their spending, possibly leading to reduce the demand for Sri Lankan workers.
The slowdown in Chinese economy will result in the reduction of tourist arrivals here from that country. It is observed that if the US Federal Reserve increases rates, it will result in the rise of interest payments on foreign loans obtained by Sri Lanka.
Besides, the ISIS domination on the countries purchasing tea from Sri Lanka will have an impact on the local economy. (Kelum Bandara)

## Title: Indian envoy ?surprised? over MR's comments against ETCA

Indian envoy ?surprised? over MR's comments against ETCA
	
India?s High Commissioner Y.K. Sinha has taken on former President Mahinda Rajapaksa and the Joint Opposition, an informal coalition of pro-Rajapaksa parties and groups, over the proposed Economic and Technology Cooperation Agreement (ETCA) between India and Sri Lanka.
Referring to reported observations of the former President and members of the Joint Opposition against the ETCA, Mr. Sinha, who did not mention the name of any Sri Lankan leader opposing the pact, told members of the Sri Lanka-India Society on Friday that he was ?surprised? to come across Mr. Rajapaksa?s statements in sections of the local press on the issue.?
It was Mr. Rajapaksa?s government that held negotiations with India over the Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA), which had included ?trade in services.? ? He described as ?quite amusing? the statements of members of the Joint Opposition, some of whom were Ministers during the Rajapaksa regime, when the CEPA, he said, was negotiated.
Mr Sinha?s response was in the context of views expressed in certain quarters that the proposed ETCA would deprive job opportunities for Sri Lankans in a host of fields including information technology and the Free Trade Agreement, effective since March 2000, had not been beneficial to Sri Lanka.
Qualifying his rebuttal, the diplomat said ?I hesitate to get into the political controversy? but he felt ?constrained? to join the debate because ?I do not think we should let naysayers take all the public space on this issue without anyone else trying to put the facts.??
Emphasising that he had not seen any draft text of the ETCA, he ?said what he received ?two days ago? was a draft text of the framework agreement, which might form the basis for further negotiations. He hastened to add that the draft framework agreement ?is not necessarily an indication? of the nature and coverage of the discussions to be held in future.
Giving an account of the CEPA negotiations during 2005-2008 (when Mr. Rajapaksa was President), he said the CEPA, ?which is [now] a dirty word here,? was ?almost concluded.? Sixteen rounds of negotiations were held, many of which were ?detailed.?
Even the two countries had ?tentatively? agreed on a draft. ?At the last minute, the Government of Sri Lanka indicated its inability to sign that agreement,? which was subsequently ?shelved.?
As part of the now-aborted agreement, under Mode 4 [of the General Agreement on Trade in Services] which pertained to ?movement of natural persons,? Sri Lanka had agreed to open up two sectors -- marine ship building and information technology (IT)/ IT-Enabled Services, both of which were ?very limited fields,? while India would throw open nearly 80 sectors.
Even in the respect of the two fields of the services sector, it was sought to be done at the request of the government of Sri Lanka, which felt that India could help it immensely. ?We do not know what the ETCA will do because serious negotiations have not begun,? Mr. Sinha pointed out.
Tracing the genesis of the proposed pact, the High Commissioner said Sri Lanka?s Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, during his visit to New Delhi in September, had set ?very ambitious timelines,? according to which the framework agreement should be ?concluded by 2015 end or 2016 early and the final agreement by June 2016.?
The diplomat expressed the hope that there would be an understanding over the framework of the ETCA soon.
On the rationale behind the fresh pact, he said there was no formal agreement in place to regularise ?investment and services? even though India invested $one billion since 2003 and another $1.5 billion to 2 billion was in the pipeline, apart from the existence of three modes of trade in services and the issue of 350-400 employment visas by Indian High Commission to Sri Lankan nationals last year.
Terming ?absurd? the argument that the 16-year-old FTA had not been beneficial to Sri Lanka, he said that in 1999, the value of Sri Lankan exports to India was $49 million and this went up to $645 million in 2015. ?Noting that there had not been much increase in the value of Sri Lankan exports since 2005, he raised the question whether this was due to ?limited? base of the exports. He added that that the regulatory framework in India was ?non-discriminatory.?
The Emergency Ambulance Health Protection Service, modelled on the lines of the ?108 Emergency Response Services? of India and being implemented with Indian government?s grant of $ 7.55 million, has nothing to do with the proposed Economic and Technology Cooperation Agreement (ETCA), ?Mr. Sinha has said.
Expressing dismay over the controversy on the launch of the scheme, Mr. Sinha said the service was in response to a ?specific request? made by Sri Lanka?s Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe to his counterpart Narendra Modi during the latter?s visit here last year.?
?We were not that keen?
Admitting that originally, the Indian side was not ?that keen? when the request was made, the High Commissioner said this was because India had already extended its portfolio and it was providing assistance of over $2.6 billion (grants and loans combined). But, the service eventually came through as Mr. Wickremesinghe had followed up the matter with a formal letter and some Sri Lankan Ministers had visited India to study how the service was working.
He clarified that ambulances would be registered in the name of the Ministry of Health and Indigenous Medicine in the government of Sri Lanka and not that of GVKEMRI of India, the implementing agency in the initial phase. ?The service would be offered free of charge as long as the Indian government was funding it, he added.

Malaysia may look to Sri Lanka for security guards
	
The ruling that only Nepalis can be hired as security guards may soon be lifted to allow foreigners from other source countries such as Sri Lanka to take on the job.
Deputy Home Minister Datuk Nur Jazlan Mohamed said the review of the decade-old policy comes in light of recent nationwide operations to weed out illegals, including those hired as security guards.
?We may have to look at other source countries that have a good supply of security guards with military background, such as Sri Lanka.
?Formerly, the job was reserved for Nepalis owing to their reputations as Gurkhas,? he said yesterday.
However, he said a limited supply of Nepali security guards has forced some companies to hire other nationals.
?The supply of Gurkhas is very limited as not all Nepalis were in the army.
?Some companies hire other foreigners and this is not allowed under the current policy,? he said, adding that there were about 800 licensed security guard companies.
Nur Jazlan advised housing associations and management committees to hire only trained security guards.
He was commenting on problems faced by residential associations and managements following the crackdown. (The Star Online)

Swiss NGOs warn ?too early? to send SL asylum seekers home
	
Some Swiss non-governmental groups said it was still much too early for asylum seekers to go back to Sri Lanka whereas Sri Lanka?s foreign minister promised his citizens living in Switzerland a safe return to the island during his recent visit to Bern, Swiss media reported.
Around 50,000 people from Sri Lanka live in Switzerland, mostly Tamils, who fled the island?s 30-year civil war that ended in 2009. Sri Lanka would like them to return and certain Swiss NGOs are alarmed by the prospect.
?In our view, this step comes too early,? Adrian Schuster, a Sri Lanka expert at the Swiss Refugee Council, told Swiss public radio on Thursday. ?We have received reports that in 2015 returning people were arrested or abducted in Sri Lanka."
On Thursday during his visit to the Swiss capital, Sri Lanka?s foreign minister, Mangala Samaraweera, urged citizens to return home.
?We encourage citizens to return to take part in the reconstruction of the country,? he said. ?We guarantee the safety of citizens who return to the country.?
Amnesty International, however, also has serious misgivings. The general situation has improved since the launch of the reconciliation process, says Nadia Boehlen, spokesperson for the Swiss branch: ?But there is an anti-terrorist law that allows the state to lock people up and the demilitarization of the North and Northeast has not yet taken place, neither have people had their land returned.?
She said a recent visit to the island confirmed that torture was still carried out.
