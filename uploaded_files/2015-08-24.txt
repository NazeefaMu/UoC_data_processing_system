Election to 335 LG bodies in November
	
	The government is determined to hold elections to the now dissolved local government bodies in November, an authoritative government source said yesterday.
	Public Administration, Local Government and Provincial Councils Secretary J. Dadallage told Daily Mirror that President Maithripala Sirisena had on Friday signed the gazette notification outlining the criteria for the Delimitation of Local Government Bodies and it is expected to be released today paving the way for local government elections under a new local government electoral system.
	Mr. Dadallage said the government is required to hold such elections within six months of the release of the gazette notification and after the expiry of the remaining 25 local government bodies.
	Elections would have to be held to elect members to 335 local government bodies.
	He said 210 local government bodies are administered by special commissioners after their term of office expired. The term of office of 15 Municipal Councils, five Pradeshiya Sabhas and one Urban Council will end either on October 16 or on October 31.
	The Municipal Councils of Dehiwala-Mt. Lavinia, Sri Jayewardenepura, Kotte, Moratuwa, Negombo, Gampaha, Kurunegala, Kandy, Matara, Nuwara-Eliya, Badulla, Galle, Matara, Ratnapura, Anuradhapura and Kalmunai will end their term of office on October 16, 2015 while the Municipal Councils of Colombo and Hambantota; the Pradeshiya Sabhas of Kotikawatta-Mulleriyawa, Kundasale, Kadawath Hatara-Gangawatakorale, Hambantota and Suriyawewa and that of the Kolonnawa Urban Council will end their term of office on October 31.
	The final report of the national delimitation committee appointed on the recommendation of the Parliamentary Select Committee on electoral reforms chaired by Dinesh Gunawardana was handed over to former minister Karu Jayasuriya recently.
	In the Colombo District, 252 members will be elected from single member wards, 56 from 28 two-member wards and 21 from seven three-member wards. At Badulla, 197 out of a total of 239 local government members will be elected from single wards and 42 for 21 two-member seats. At Batticaloa District in the East, 140 local government members will be elected for single member wards while six will be elected from two-member wards.
	?The main objective of the new local government electoral system is to do away with the much criticised Preferential Voting (PR) system and give the opportunity to the voter to elect honest, educated and people-friendly members to their local government bodies. Those who are elected must be prepared to provide an honorable service and suitable to be called honorable members by the people,? Mr. Dadallage stressed.
	There will be no local government or Provincial Council elections on a scattered basis and all elections will be held on a single day.
	President Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe have decided to fully concentrate on nation building and good governance and to provide a political solution to the national question.(Sandun A Jayasekera)

No legal basis for an int'l investigation
	
	Asserting that there was no legal basis for an international investigation within Sri Lanka, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said that there should be a domestic inquiry into the alleged violations of human rights in Sri Lanka.
	In an interview with India?s The Hindu, the day after he assumed office, Mr. Wickremesinghe said that it should be a domestic inquiry as Sri Lanka wasn't a signatory to the Statute of Rome.
	?We have agreed it is domestic for the simple reason that we did not sign the Statute of Rome. The commitment that was given by the Rajapaksa administration to the U.N. Human Rights Council (UNHRC) in 2009 could be interpreted in many ways. At one stage they were moving towards international investigation. But we always said, the UNP, that there was no legal basis for international investigation within Sri Lanka; it had to be domestic,? he said.
	He also said, ?The reason some of the people have been calling for international investigation is the loss of confidence in the judiciary. We?ve had this problem before, in the North and in the South. We would like to put forward a domestic mechanism which would be within the four corners of our Constitution but would also be acceptable to all the communities in Sri Lanka plus the international community.?
	Prime Minister Wickremesinghe is also confident and hopeful that the political situation in Sri Lanka following the August 17 general elections, although complex, is favourable for forging an enduring political solution to the Tamil question.
	Noting that the two main national parties (his United National Party and the Sri Lanka Freedom Party), and the Tamil National Alliance were ?the three key players? in formulating the proposals for an enduring solution, he said he had ?tried to keep the UNP position flexible so that we can bridge the differences.? Responding to a question on former President Chandrika Kumaratunga, he confirmed that she would have a significant role to play in this regard.
	A day after he assumed office, Prime Minister Wickremesinghe spoke to The Hindu at Temple Trees on a wide range of issues, including the project of working out a new Constitution for Sri Lanka, finding an enduring political solution to the Tamil question, and livelihood development, and human rights issues.
	Asked about time lost after the war with the LTTE ended in 2009 and the prospects of moving towards an enduring political solution now, Mr. Wickremesinghe responded: ?There have been a lot of administrative barriers, which have to be removed. Secondly, there has been a request by some of the Provincial Councils that as far as the powers exercised jointly, by both the Centre and the Provinces (concurrent powers) are concerned, some could be transferred to the Provinces. Those are the main issues and we have to work this out.?
	To a question about how the two sides could avoid getting caught in a terminological dispute over a ?unitary? versus ?federal? solution, he said: ?Substance is what we have to look at. The formula which was accepted by India also. Let?s see how we work it out within the 13th Amendment. Maximise it. Let?s build on this. That?s what we are talking about now.?
	The Sri Lankan Prime Minister also expressed the hope that a political consensus could be reached within months on a new Constitution for Sri Lanka, especially because the issues that needed to be resolved were fairly narrow.

The private sector partners to the Guinness record bid are Basilur the global tea brand and household business brand Maliban that will be the new ethos of the government on the Private-Public -People partnership to building brand Sri Lanka he voiced.?
Research indicate that when a countries brand value pegs up the quality of investments increase whilst the quality of tourists that it can attract also increase whilst the export market country mix also tends change which is what Sri Lanka needs to do said Athukorala.
At the World?s Largest Tea Party Sri Lanka tourism will invitee foreign guests from the key countries of India, china, UK, Germany, Italy, Russia, Middle East, Australian, Scandinavia and United States to be part of the event which will be linked to social media that takes the story to the key markets so that we get on the " news" of the world. Earlier this month Sri Lanka Tourism launched a unique global competition where the best twenty online videos submitted will get a 365 day holiday whilst a weekly direct mail themed ' message in a bottle" has been touching the key global media, designation marketing companies( DMC's) around the world. In the key markets we do focussed below the activations by way of Road Shows branded ?One Island, thousand treasures" whilst also being in person with the private sector in the key travel and trade fairs globally under the theme " 8 wonderful experiences in 8 wonderful days" said Athukorala. We will extend the Guinness Record to the world by way of the ' ceylon tea boutique' concept which is in every exhibition that we take part globally which costs us over a billion rupees annually he said.
Sri Lanka has garnered in over a million tourists in just seven months at a growth of 16.8% as at end July 2015 and July spiked to a 31.2% growth in visitors which was interesting given that China became the top source market said Sri Lanka Tourism Promotions Bureau in the news release. However, the dominance of the informal sector accounting for 49% of the arrivals which is approximately 7.3 million room nights must be addressed as we are launching a 200 million digital marketing campaign with the best online organizations that must help the formal sector that support SLTPB with the funding required for aggressive marketing commented Chairman Athukorala.

UNFGG ministers to be sworn in tomorrow
	
	Thirty cabinet ministers and 40 state and deputy ministers from the UNFGG will take their oaths tomorrow, informed sources said.
	Earlier the swearing in of some of the ministers had been scheduled for today. But the appointment of the new Cabinet was delayed as the two main parties -- the United National Party (UNP) and the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) -- had been unable to agree on the selection of members and the assignation of subjects, sources said.
	This issue will be further discussed between President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe when they return to Colombo this evening.
	According to the 19th Amendment, Cabinet has to be restricted to 30 members. But it could be increased if a national government is set up with the approval of parliament.
	Ministers from the SLFP will be sworn in after parliament meets on September 1. The swearing-in of ministers has to be completed within two weeks of the first parliamentary session.
	The UNP is reportedly insisting that all SLFP MPs join the national unity government if its members are to be given ministerial posts. The party has taken up that position because a section of the SLFP is opposed to the national unity government concept.
	A senior UNPer, who wished to remain anonymous, said his party was ready to offer even 16 ministries to the SLFP to form a national unity government.
	?We do not want a section of the SLFP to join the government and another section to remain in the opposition. We want the entire party to support the government. Otherwise, we will look to the Tamil National Alliance (TNA) for support,? he said.(Kelum Bandara)
The UNP is planning a different set of ministries to those of the previous six- month-duration government. (Kelum Bandara)

UPFA won't be dissolved: Gammanpila
	
	The United People Freedom Alliance (UPFA) will not be dissolved for at least five more years despite reports to the contrary, Pivithuru Hela Urumaya (PHU) General Secretary Udaya Gammanpila said today.
	?The UPFA cannot be dissolved for another five years. The elections commissioner will deal only with the UPFA secretary when making decisions on newly elected 95 MPs or about 300 members of the party in local government bodies. When there is a vacancy in elected positions, the commissioner will consult the party secretary. Therefore, the party should keep functioning,? he told a news conference held at Abhayaramaya in Colombo.
	He said there were attempts by some elements to invade the party and said the finalizing of the UPFA national list even without convening the party executive committee was such an attempt.
	Meanwhile, National Freedom Front (NFF) Leader Wimal Weerawansa said the UPFA national list had become a sanctuary of political refugees. He said a national list should not be converted into an orphanage of politicians like the Pinnawala Elephant Orphanage.
	?The people are rejecting the UPFA national list with disgust. None of the politicians who represent left politics including D.E.W. Gunasekara had been given opportunity to represent parliament from the list. We regret that the makers of the UPFA national list had stooped to this level,? he said.
	Democratic Left Front (DLF) Leader Vasudeva Nanayakkara said there was no ethical right for parliamentarians elected from the UPFA to join hands with the United National Party (UNP). ?We will oppose the UNP and its pro-imperialist moves,? he said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)
