Dont unnecessarily alarm people on Constitution: Malwatu Mahanayake tells Wimal
	
Causing unnecessary fear among the people on the Constitutional proposals and then saying tall tales is unacceptable and unhealthy, the Siyam Nikaye Malwatta Chapter Mahanayake Thibbatuwawe Sri Siddhartha Sumangala Thera told MP Wimal Weerawansa today.
This had transpired when National Freedom Front (NFF) members including Mr. Weerawansa met the Mahanayakeat the Asgiriya Malwatu Maha Viharaya in Kandy to update him about their stance on Constitutional reforms.
The MP told him that the new Constitution would harm the unitary status of the country.
The Mahanayake told Mr. Weerawansa that President Mairthripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe had assured him that any proposal that encourages separatism wont be included in the Constitution.
Since the Constitution will be put to a referendum, the thera asked him and other NFF members not to be unnecessarily alarmed about it. (Chamil Rupasinghe and Nadeeka Daya Bandara)

Govt. drafts Constitution according to Al-Hussein's whims: Wimal
	
National Freedom Front (NFF) leader Wimal Weerawansa, yesterday, charged that the government was in a hurry to draft a new Constitution, to satisfy the whims and fancies of UN Human Rights Commissioner Zeid Ra'ad Al-Hussein.
Delivering a lecture on the Constitution being drafted by the government, he said the governments plan was to pass the new Constitution in the Parliament in November and then hold a referendum in January.
He said UNHR Commissioner Al-Hussein had outlined, in a statement on July 28, 2016, these plans of the government to pass the Constitution.
He said, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe gave contradictory responses to Opposition MPs' queries about the Constitution in Parliament.
The danger exists of a federal Constitution which could divide the country, he said.
He warned that the national anthem, the national flag, the unitary status of the country and the foremost place given to Buddhism -- which were all guaranteed in the existing Constitution -- would be undermined by the new Constitution, which would also decentralise power.
He said the country could be divided by the Western Countries by means of the present government even without waging war. (Piyumi Fonseka)

Govt. slow against cigarette menace: GMOA
	
Despite President Maithripala Sirisenas personal concern on eradication of tobacco from the country, the government is slow in reinforcing legal framework to minimize the consumption of cigarette among the citizens, Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) today said.
While extending their support to the government against the cigarette menace, the government doctors yesterday sent him a set of proposals prepared by the GMOA to make policy decisions towards a legal framework.
Among the ten proposals prepared according to the World Health Organizations Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (WHO FCTC) the doctors request the President to ban selling of cigarettes separately, introduce licenses for the permitted places that sell cigarettes and apply a warning sign on the surface of every cigarette.
The GMOA proposal required amendments of the National Authority on Tobacco & Alcohol (NATA) Act to completely prohibit smoking in public.
GMOA Media Spokesman Dr. Saman Ananda, presenting the proposals before the media said laws and regulations should be introduced to ban any promotion activities carried out by multi-million Tobacco Companies under the guise of charity work.
Mobile message service network to communicate the public on hazards of cigarettes was also among the proposals.
Digital notice boards should be set up to strengthen public awareness on cigarettes menace. We also propose that the government should encourage those who voluntarily present themselves to give up smoking by properly implementing the existing hotline service. The number of cigarette users can also be reduced by enhancing the current pictorial warnings on cigarette packets, Dr. Ananda said.
According to the government doctors, more than 4,800 chemicals are in a cigarette. Among the 4,800 chemicals, more than 250 are highly poisonous and 69 of them cause cancer.
The GMOA stated that if the tax on cigarettes is increased up to 90%, the government will earn close to Rs.12 billion revenue.
However, the Cabinet approval has not yet been included in the Cabinet Paper to increase taxes on tobacco and alcoholic products presented by President Sirisena and Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne, six weeks ago.
According to an earlier statement made by the President, over 35 per cent of the income of underprivileged families in Sri Lanka was spent on tobacco and alcohol, while around 25,000 people die of tobacco-related diseases in Sri Lanka per year. (Piyumi Fonseka)

Importance of e-commerce in a digital era
	

The rapid proliferation of Internet-related services has transformed the way businesses are run and transactions are carried out, which is paving the way for a bustling era of e-commerce and digital payments. With the help of modern technology, digital money is changing the way currency is perceived. Merchants can now attract customers to their online market place by utilizing digital commerce and payment systems as a powerful selling tool. Strong long-term fundamentals, web and ecommerce segments in Asia forecast high growth potential in 2016 and beyond whilst growing consumer markets and the continued development of the e-commerce sector will underpin its growth prospects.
In January 2015, FMCG giant Unilever Sri Lanka and wOw.lk, Sri Lankas premier ecommerce portal and a unit of Dialog Axiata PLC, joined hands in an exciting new partnership. In a growing online shopping industry, the collaboration of two industry leaders bore all the signs of a promising initiative to popularizing the purchase of some of Unilevers best known brands through a convenient online medium.
Today the Sri Lankan e-commerce industry is at an important crossroads and Channa Tennakoon  Head of Media and Digital, Unilever Sri Lanka Limited and Sheyantha Abeykoon  Chief Executive Officer, Digital Commerce Lanka (Pvt.) Ltd, the company that owns and operates wOw.lk, share their input on how important the e-commerce business is from a merchants perspective and reflect on some of their experiences over the past year.
Selling products online: Explaining the prime motivations to take their products online, Tennakoon stated, Being actively present on ecommerce is a natural progression that is inevitable in the current marketplace. Establishing an optimal ecommerce presence early on is likely to reap its benefits in the not so distant future. Furthermore, the ecommerce boom in the South Asian region especially in India is highly encouraging. However, Sri Lankan ecommerce has its own set of unique challenges and Unilever hopes to pioneer the FMCG sector in successfully conquering these challenges.
Selecting wOw.lk as your launch partner to go online: wOw.lk being the largest e-commerce company in Sri Lanka and its commitment to being at the forefront of the industry, made wOw.lk an easy choice in terms of a launch partner. Also being owned and operated by Dialog Axiata PLC further strengthens wOw.lks armoury of infrastructure with which they can leverage to drive growth in the e-commerce sphere.
Journey so far: Elaborating on the partnership over the past year, he further stated, The past year was a focused effort on stepping into the e-commerce arena with personal care range of brands. Along with the launch of the Unilever e-commerce platform within wOw.lk, we were able to execute multiple special promotions targeting seasons, events and brand campaigns.
Future plans in the e-commerce sphere: We have a long-term vision in terms of Unilevers objectives in the ecommerce space. We believe that it will be necessary to constantly expand and fine tune our ecommerce presence in order to rapidly evolve with the needs of the e-consumer. It is safe to say that Unilever is in it for the long haul when it comes to the ecommerce space.
Growing with new partnerships: Commenting on how the partnership with Unilever fit into wOw.lk overall growth plans, Abeykoon said, wOw.lk as the market leader in the local ecommerce industry has always strived to play a lead role in developments in the sector. Our tag line of the complete shopping experience embodies a philosophy of offering the widest breadth of products to our consumers through the most convenient means. Over the past few years, we have seen the growth in online shopping being centred largely around a few high ticket categories. As we try and grow the popularity of other categories online, such as personal care and homecare, it is necessary to work together with the market leaders in these sectors, to help them achieve their online ambitions and in doing so to collectively grow the market.
Learnings over the year: Initially there was a process of learning, trial and error. The product catalogue that a company like Unilever has is widely available in the offline domain, through a very efficient distribution network, particularly in the general trade sector. So unlike some of the other products that we carry  we had to be very clear about the problem we were solving for the consumer. Hence, choosing the right products to market, being creative with our promotions, observing consumer buying patterns was very important in helping the company establish an online market for Unilever products. I can confidently say we are on the right track  although volumes are still small they have grown appreciably in the last six months.
Growth plans for the future: Fortunately Unilever shares a few key common values with us; we give a lot of priority to product and service innovation, spend a lot of time trying to analyze and better understand consumer behaviour and are willing to experiment. Based on our observations over the past 16 months we will be formulating a list of innovative online propositions to take to the market place in the forthcoming year.
Unilever Sri Lanka Limited today it is home to 29 strong brands that are leaders in the categories that they operate in. With the local consumer being at the heart of our business they have products ideally suited to the Sri Lankan consumer. Unilever Sri Lanka provides employment to 1100 people directly and many thousands more indirectly through its dedicated suppliers, distributors and service providers while their product portfolio expands from household care, fabric cleaning, skin cleansing, skin care, oral care, hair care, tea, spreads, toilet cleaning, personal grooming and water.
wOw.lk is owned and operated by Digital Commerce Lanka (Pvt.) Limited, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Dialog Axiata PLC. The company is an industry pioneer and the largest ecommerce company catering to the domestic consumer.wOw.lk continuously strives to meet the varied needs of the local online shopping community, delivering a superior virtual shopping experience with a variety of affordable products and services.

Impose special tax of Rs.20 to cover VAT shortfall : JO
	
The joint opposition today asked President Maithripala Sirisena to impose a special tax of Rs.20 on a cigarette with immediate effect so that the government could earn a revenue of Rs.82 billion.
MP Bandula Gunawardena told a media briefing that this proposal should be implemented in addition to the current tax on alcohol and tobacco products because some of the finance ministry bigwigs were not prepared to increase the prevailing tax structure on these products.
He said Rs.41 billion worth of cigarettes was produced annually.
The special tax of Rs.20 which I have proposed is similar to the special commodity levy on essential items. In 2015, the tax revenue from tobacco products was estimated at Rs.80 billion. The state income will be doubled if the proposed special tax were implemented, the MP said adding that it would help recover the VAT shortfall of Rs.55 billion between the current Rs.220 billion and the envisaged Rs.275 billion.
It will be practical and justifiable if the Government could recover the rest of the shortfall by way of a special tax of Rs.20 on each cigarette, rather than burdening the people by increasing the VAT, he added.
He said the smoking habit had not declined even though the tax on tobacco products had been increased from time to time and that even in this instance there would be not much of a decrease in the smoking of cigarettes. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)

Malaysian police step up security for Sri Lankan envoy
	
Malaysian police have increased security measures for Sri Lankas High Commissioner to Malaysia after he was assaulted at the Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA) earlier this month.
Malaysian Inspector-General of Police Khalid Abu Bakar also said his men were looking for four more suspects who were allegedly involved in the attack on Ibrahim Sahib Ansar.
We have arrested five so far. I regret what had happened and we have increased the security for the high commissioner.
We have stationed a security team at his residence and his office, and we have provided him with personal security, he said at a press conference in Bukit Aman this morning.
Earlier reports had stated that a group of Malaysian Tamils had assaulted Ibrahim at a restricted area in the KLIA, with CCTV footage showing the angry mob cornering and questioning him before beating him down to the floor.
The assault on Ibrahim came after some 50 people had gathered outside the Putra World Trade Centre to protest against the visit by former Sri Lankan President Mahinda Rajapaksa, whom they accused of being a war criminal.
The protesters cited the killing of thousands of Tamils during the civil war in Sri Lanka that ended in 2009, as a reason for their objection against Rajapaksas attendance at the conference of Asian political parties organised by the Malaysian Government.

The use of square pin plugs will in future be the standard for Sri Lanka and as such the import and manufacture of appliances other than G-plugs commonly known as square pin plugs will be banned in future, Public Utilities Commission (PUCSL) Chairman Saliya Mathew said today.
The ban on the import and manufacture of round-pin appliances will take effect from August 16 next year while the ban on their sale will be effective from August 16, 2018.
From August 16, 2016, the wiring of new installations, the addition of circuits to existing installations or complete re-wiring of existing installation, should be carried out with 2.5 mm 2 (7/0.67 mm Cu) and must be compatible with type G-13A socket outlets, Mr. Mathew said.
The regulations of a national standard for plugs and sockets for non-industrial applications will be implemented with the aim of uplifting the safety of electricity consumers
The Commission has decided that the Type G-plug and socket outlet, widely known as the 13 Ampere plug and socket outlet, commonly referred to as the Square Pin plug and socket is to be the national standard in Sri Lanka, the PUCSL said.However, the transition to the type G-standard plug and socket should not require any premises to be re-wired purely for the purpose of accommodating the new standard, and that the existing wiring may remain until the end of its life period.
The PCUSL said Sri Lanka currently used different types of plugs and sockets to make a connection to a wall socket and often the plug on an appliance does not fit to the base.
"Electricity users adopt a variety of methods and devices, most of which are unsafe and cause the connection to be unreliable," it said. There has been some 95 electrocutions in 2015 up from 76 in 2013 and 73 in 2014. Use of substandard plugs, sockets, electrical accessories, adaptors and extension cords are one of the main causes for electrocution and fire." (Chaturanga Pradeep)

The background to his gubernatorial ambition is this: A leading political authority had had a chance meeting with this politico at an outstation ceremony some time ago and on that occasion the authority had said: I would be certainly happy if I could offer a governor post to a good person like you.
The politico who had taken the flippant remark by the political bigwig seriously had got a suit tailored immediately and he has been waiting for the important call from the palace ever since.

Suspected war criminals from SL living freely in UK
	
Scores of suspected war criminals involved in bloody conflicts in Sri Lanka, Libya, Afghanistan, Rwanda and Serbia seeking to live in Britain escaped deportation thanks to a series of blunders, Daily Mail reported today.
It said the officials failed to throw out 135 individuals accused of appalling crimes in the some of the worlds poorest countries despite blocking their bids for citizenship.
And the suspects escaped police investigation after officials also failed to refer any of them to Scotland Yards specialist war crimes unit.
Campaigners slammed the Government as they warned the country risks becoming a safe haven for war criminals.
They said it was hard to understand how officials could block attempts to remain in the country but not try to deport them or refer their cases to police.
Last night, the Home Office said it has closed the apparent loophole in its procedures so that suspected war criminals will face further investigation.
A spokesman said police will be informed about every case where a negative immigration decision is taken due allegations of war crimes, genocide or torture.
The figures highlight concerns that war criminals from around the world are turning to Britain as their retirement home.
Hundreds of people involved in bloody conflicts in Rwanda, Afghanistan, Libya, Serbia and Sri Lanka, have been able to settle in UK.
In many cases human rights laws have meant that the worse their crimes, the more difficult it is to send them home.
After confessing what they have done, war criminals claim they face inevitable death or torture if they were to be returned home.
Figures revealed under Freedom of Information laws showed 40 applications for citizenship were refused last year due to fears that the individuals were involved in war crimes.
A further 50 applications were refused in 2014 and 45 in 2013.
The Home Office refused to disclose which countries the applicants were originally from.
But officials confirmed none of the cases were referred to the Met, which deals with war crimes investigations as part of its counter terrorism unit.
They also confirmed none of the cases were referred to colleagues for potential deportation from our shores.
The figures raise questions about how the applicants were able to enter the country in the first place as citizenship bids can only be made after they have been resident for five years.
Allan Hogarth, of Amnesty International, branded the figures as extremely worrying.
On the face of it, its hard to understand how all these individuals could have raised such serious concerns during a citizenship process yet apparently nothing at all be done over potentially putting these people on trial, he said.
If there are reasonable grounds to suspect that a person here has been involved in acts of torture, war crimes or even genocide in a foreign country then surely the Home Office must be alerting the police and prosecution authorities who have a duty to act.
We absolutely mustnt let Britain become some kind of bolthole for war criminals. Officials need to explain whats happened here and what their policy is on referring such cases for further investigation and potential prosecution.
Kevin Laue, of Redress, which campaigns for justice on behalf of torture victims, called on police to investigate all cases where suspicions of war crimes exist.
He said: People refused citizenship because they are suspected of war crimes, crimes against humanity, genocide or torture should always be investigated by the Met so that they can be prosecuted here, if there is sufficient evidence to do so.
These are the most serious crimes imaginable and the police should have sufficient resources to investigate all suspects properly, which they cannot do if the Home Office doesnt refer them to the Met.
The Government has said the UK should not be a safe haven, but it appears to be just that.
Campaigners are unhappy that Britain opted out of a network created to help prosecutors across Europe pursue war crimes.
The Government has said there was no compelling evidence it delivered any practical benefit to the UK.
The Home Office said: We take allegations of involvement in war crimes extremely seriously and apply a robust approach to dealing with any immigration cases linked to war crimes. This includes refusing naturalization or asylum where appropriate.
This year we have revised the referral process so that the police are sighted on every case where a negative immigration decision will be taken due to suspicion that an individual in the UK has had involvement in war crimes, crimes against humanity, genocide or torture. (Daily Mail - UK)

Tuberculosis (TB) which is an airborne disease is spreading in some parts of the Colombo City, Colombo Municipality's Chief Medical Officer Dr. Ruwan Wijemuni said yesterday.

There has been 20 reported cases from these areas this year which is far more than last year, Dr. Wijemuni said. Our health officers are educating people in these areas on the precaution they need to take and have also conducted clinics together with officials of the Health Ministry, he added.
The disease is spread especially by unprotected sneezing and by breathing into another persons face.

They enjoy basking in the leaders glory
	
There are two Diyawanna members who have made it a habit to occupy the two seats located immediately behind a prominent political leader if vacant, whenever the latter is about to address the august assembly.
Ripples of amusement run through the House whenever these two members  one from the North Central and the other from Wayamba  rush forward to sit behind the political leader when he rises to his feet. Most colleagues are now privy to the reason for this unusual behaviour:
to poke their heads over the leaders shoulder from either side for they know that video cameras are invariably focused on this leader whenever he addresses the assembly which means their faces too would figure in the footage when it is aired by various TV channels! The two seats which the two members invade whenever they are vacant belong to two purohitas, they say.

VAT would be only for nine months: Rajitha
	
Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne said today the Value Added Tax (VAT) would be imposed only for nine months and that the government would take steps to provide relief to people by simplifying the VAT after nine months.
He said the VAT had to be imposed to pay back the loan amount of Rs.1.3 trillion that the previous government had obtained from various banks.
The previous government had obtained State loans not through the Treasury but from State banks in other ways.
So the loan amount that the government had to pay back was Rs.1.3 trillion according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
That is why this VAT issue has arisen. It is a temporary issue. The World Bank has agreed to provide US$ 4.5 billion and Asian Development Bank has agreed to provide US$ 1.5 billion to pay back this loan amount, he said.
Minister Senaratne expressed these views while participating at the Kalutara District State Services Sports Festival yesterday. He said the VAT Bill which was approved by the Cabinet today would have less impact on the people than the previous one. Mr. Senaratne said the budget for 2017 would be submitted to Parliament on November 10. (Ajith Siriwardana)

A story about a porcupine invading a pangolins burrow
	

A fair one holding a high political office in the Central Province has gone into the occupation of the official residence of the city chief saying that her own official residence is in need of repairs.

The real reason for her to invade the residence of the city chief is her dislike for her own official residence  an old mansion located on a hilly terrain fringed by a woodland. On the contrary, the city chiefs official residence sits on a location with surroundings of scenic beauty, they say. 
An informed one said that he would not be surprised if the lady decided to have changed the residence for keeps. Ittewa kebellawage geta ringuwa wagei (It is like the proverbial porcupine invading the pangolins burrow) he quipped.

Batch of SL refugees return from TN today
	
Ninety individuals of 35 families, who had fled to Tamil Nadu, India during the conflict period, will return to Sri Lanka today through the voluntary repatriation programme facilitated by the UNHRC, the Ministry of Resettlement said.
The returnees, expected to arrive at the Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA) this afternoon, would be welcomed by Rehabilitation and Resettlement Ministry secretary and UNHCR Representative in Sri Lanka.
While welcoming returnees the Minister was expected to engage in a discussion with them on their views, a media statement issued by the Ministry said.
The Rehabilitation, Resettlement Ministry has implemented housing projects and livelihood assistance programmes in the conflict affected areas for which the returnees are also eligible to apply, if they fulfil the prescribed criteria, in order to rebuild their lives, it said.
UNHCR assists refugee returnees by supporting their air travel and helps them to complete immigration, security and customs formalities. In addition, UNHCR assists with the opening of bank accounts for the returnees via Bank of Ceylon and provides a reintegration grant and monetised non-food assistance, intended for purchasing basic household goods.
All returning refugees are also provided with a modest transport grant to help them travel from the airport to their home communities in dignity. Once settled, returnees are requested to register with the UNHCR field office for protection, monitoring and assistance through referrals, it said.
As of today, the total number of refugee returnees arriving in Sri Lanka through the UNHCR facilitated voluntary repatriation programme stands at 506 individuals, indicating a continued upward trend since 2014.

Cabinet approves VAT Bill
	
The Valued Added Tax (Amendment) Bill, which was approved by the Cabinet today will be presented in Parliament next week, Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake said.
He said it was identical to the Bill which the government was unsuccessful in introducing earlier and that it would be gazetted yesterday. The process of introducing this bill was nullified by the Supreme Court on the basis that due procedure had not been followed. A finance bill should be presented only after the Cabinet signifies to Parliament that it has been approved.
According to the earlier Bill, the government sought to increase VAT from 11 per cent to 15 per cent and sought to do away with exemptions granted to certain service sectors such as telecommunication.
There were countrywide protests against the original version of the Bill with traders taking to the streets and shops being closed. (Kelum Bandara)
