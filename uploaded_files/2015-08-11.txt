Tsunami funds: Champika says MR may lose civic rights if guilty
	
	United National Front for Good Governance (UNFGG) General Secretary and Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka said today that former president Mahinda Rajapaksa would be stripped of his civic rights if he was found guilty of misappropriating Tsunami funds.
	?Mahinda Rajapaksa will have to face the charges levelled against him with regard to the misappropriating of Tsunami funds and assisting a terrorist organisation. He had presented a Cabinet note instead of a proper Cabinet paper to release funds for the LTTE. Since he had taken measures in his capacity as the then finance minister when asking the Treasury to release the funds to the LTTE, the legal immunity of a president will not be able to protect him,? the minister told a news conference.
	He said according to Clause No: 157 of the Constitution, aiding and abetting a terrorist organisation could result in a person losing his or her civil rights for seven years. It also includes the from employment in state institutions if they are state employees.
	The minister said Mr. Rajapaksa had provided Rs.800 million to the LTTE, through the Reconstruction and Development Agency (RADA) headed by former parliamentarian Tiran Alles and said the police had found records of a part of it being a cash transaction of some Rs.169 million.
	He said the funding of the LTTE by Mr. Rajapaksa through bogus companies had continued until the LTTE attacked former Defence Secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa in 2006.
	?Neither Mahinda Rajapaksa nor his brother Basil, who had secret meetings with LTTE front-liner Emil Kanthan, had denied the charges against them of having funded the LTTE,? the minister said.
	He challenged the former president for an open debate on charges against him and said he was equipped with evidence to prove the charges.
	Meanwhile, commenting on the Supreme Court delaying the arrest of former MP Tiran Alles, the minister said the case was blow to the reputation of the Supreme Court.
	?The case should not be heard in the Supreme Court. I may be charged of contempt of court for making these remarks but I?m not afraid to tell the truth,? he said adding that they would make sure the judges are impartial in future and would probe all cases of corruption and disappearance.

Exhumation of Thajudeen's body infuriates UPFA
	
Furious over the exhumation of the Havelock's Rugby Captain Wasim Thajudeen on a Court order, the UPFA claimed there were eye witnesses to prove that Thajudeen was killed in a accident on May 17, 2012.
Colombo district UPFA candidate Udaya Gammanpila told the media that he had evidence to show that Thajudeen had been drinking till late at night with two other friends and had left the club to drop his two friends in his car when the fateful accident occurred.
?He had dropped one friend at 11.50 p.m and the other at 11.55 p.m. He met with the fatal accident at 12.00 midnight on Park Road near Shalika Hall in Narahenpita. When he crashed on to the parapet wall on the left hand side of the road, there has been a huge sound. One person who was traveling to the Bandaranaike International Airport at that time on Park Road had seen the accident. Another person, an engineer, living nearby had seen seen the inferno after he came out to check the sound and is said to have called the 119,? Mr. Gammanpila said.
He claimed it was impossible to torture and kill a heavily built man like Thajudeen 6 feet 2 inches in height in a few minutes as there was less than 10 minutes between his leaving the club and accident.
Mr. Gammanpila said Thajudeen's family members were against the exhumation and might they may have cooperated with the police and the court officials because they may have been under pressure.
He said the government had resorted to a different tactic after failing to convince the ?Hora? allegations against UPFA leaders and challenged the government to inquire into the brutal murder of journalist Lasantha Wickramatunga and the disappearance of Pradeep Eknaligoda and asked why the murder of Mr. Thajudeen was re-opened at the tail end of the election propaganda campaign.
Mr. Gammanpila pleaded with the government not to use the dead for a political mileage during elections.
Commenting on the UNP's five-point development programme in the next five years to make Sri Lanka the Center of Excellence in South Asia, he claimed that the new country, Mr. Ranil Wickremesinghe promises might be without the North and East because he will have include the TNA under his national government which promises the northern voters self rule for the North-East with police and land powers and merger of the two provinces.
He challenged Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka to a public debate on the former president Mahinda Rajapaksa?s alleged financial assistance to the LTTE.
Mr. Gammanpila said the West and the US in particular were successful on January 8 by toppling former president Rajapaksa and now they want a regime change but people would not fall into the pit during the day time though they fell into it during the night and pointed out that the US had done this in many countries in the past.

	UPFA Colombo district candidate Wimal Weerawansa today alleged that the government was planning to sell the national carrier SriLankan under its restructuring programme.
	He told a media conference that separate companies are to be established for ground handling, training of cadet pilots, catering, management and maintenance of the airline.
	?The proposed re-structuring will no doubt create the laying off of 6,800 employees directly and 30,000 indirectly. What is most damaging is their decision to sign code-share agreements with other international airlines on profitable air routes. The plan is to sell all these services to private companies,? he claimed.
	Mr. Weerawansa claimed that all foreign media including the BBC had predicted a clear victory for the UPFA and a UPFA government formed after August 17 would reverse faulty agreements entered by the 'yahapalana' government.
	The Financial Crime Investigation Division (FCID) which was in a subdued mode during the past few weeks has sprung into action again with the election day approaching and it was likely that a few arrests would be made in the next few days on the instructions of Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne.

ICRA Lanka assigns Commercial Credit and Finance [SL]BBB rating with stable outlook
	
		 		 
		 
			
ICRA Lanka Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of ICRA Ltd, a group company of Moody?s Investors Service has assigned the Issuer rating of [SL]BBB (pronounced SL triple B) with a stable outlook to Commercial Credit and Finance PLC (CCF or the Company).
The rating factors in CCF?s established business presence in Sri Lanka, its experienced senior management team along with the presence of a private equity investor who holds about 28 percent stake in the company and, its robust profitability indicators.
ICRA Lanka however takes note of CCF?s high gearing level, significant dependence on deposits and exposure to a customer segment with modest credit profile that is highly vulnerable to the economic cycles.
The rating also takes note of the increase in the NPA during FY2015 (about 11.2 percent in September 2014), the same however has moderated to reasonable levels as in March 2015 (4.1 percent).
ICRA Lanka notes that the company?s asset quality is subdued as compared to in the past and also notes the limited seasoning of the Microfinance (MF) and MF-related SME, however the strong provision coverage (about 88 percent as in March 2015) and good profitability indicators is expected to support the overall financial profile of the company.
CCF?s gross lending portfolio increased to about Rs. 48.3 billion as of March 2015, recording a 79 percent Y-o-Y growth.
ICRA Lanka takes note of the weakening in the asset quality indicators during FY2015 due to the increase in the delinquencies witnessed in the pawing portfolio.
The company?s gross NPAs increased from about 2.5 percent in March 2013 to as high as about 11.2 percent in September 2014 before moderating to about 4.1 percent in March 2015. CCF?s provision coverage however is strong at about 88 percent in March 2015 although the same moderated from over 100 percent in March 2013.
The Company recognized losses to the extent of Rs. 520 million on account of auctions in the pawning book during FY2015 and reduced the share of the pawning book during the period. ICRA Lanka notes that the company could be faced with further slippages in the pawning book, however the impact of the same is expected to remain moderate as compared to in the past.
The rating takes note of the moderate NPAs in the MF/ MF-related SME loans, which stood at about 1.3 percent as in March 2015, however the same has been increasing over the past; also the company has repossessed stock of about Rs.600 million as in March 2015. Notwithstanding the healthy provision coverage, ability of the company to reduce losses on sale of these stocks and, to contain NPAs in the MF/MF-related SME loans at reasonable levels, as the business expands and portfolio seasons would be a key monitorable from a credit perspective.
The company is largely dependent on deposits, which accounted for about 87 percent (81 percent being fixed deposits) of the total funding base as in March 2015.
The healthy yields on the loans coupled with the moderation in the cost of funds has helped CCF to maintain robust lending spread of about 20 percent for the last three financial years.
Operating cost of the company has come down over time to 9.3 percent in FY2015 as compared to 11.0 percent in FY2014 due to the steep portfolio growth, although the company has been increasing its service network quite sharply (43 locations added in FY2015 to increase presence to about 118 locations).

Lankan found not guilty of raping S.Korean student
	
	An appeals court on Tuesday found a Sri Lankan man accused of raping a South Korean college student not guilty, citing a lack of evidence.
	The Daegu High Court acquitted the 49-year-old, identified only by the initial K, of charges that he sexually assaulted and robbed 18-year-old student Chung Eun-hee, who later died in a car accident right after the crime in 1998.
	While the case was concluded as a mere accident at that time, prosecutors launched another investigation in 2011 as K's DNA was found to match that of the semen found in Chung's underwear.
	Two alleged accomplices returned to Sri Lanka in 2001 and 2005, respectively.
	The court, however, said there was not enough evidence to verify that the suspect committed the crime.
	"The key witness' testimony that he heard the specifics of the crime from an accomplice is not admissible and even if it is, it lacks credibility," said Judge Lee Beom-kyun.
	Lee pointed out that it is hard to believe that the suspect who did not have close relations with the witness would have told the person details of the crime.
	While acknowledging the possibility that the suspects could have sexually abused the victim, the judge said they cannot be punished because the statute of limitations for rape has expired.
	Prosecutors said they will appeal the case to the Supreme Court. (Korea Times)

Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe is the ideal politician to work with President Maithripala Sirisena for the next five years and take Sri Lanka forward based on a strong foreign policy and meaningful development, UNP candidate Rosy Senanayake said today.
She told a news conference in Colombo, that the unique and unparalleled combination of the two politicians President Sirisena and Prime Minister Wickremeisnghe who would able to work together prudently for a better country.
?The only person who is capable of collaborating with our President Sirisena during the next five years and carry out the development plans is the Prime Minister. He has the confidence of the people and the President. This has been clearly shown in the President?s address to the nation where he said Mr. Wickremesinghe was known to be a politician untainted by corruption. That was why he selected him on January 8 to be the Prime Minister of the government,? Ms. Senanayake said.
She said the GSP+ benefits will soon be received to the Sri Lankan business system as a result of criteria and procedure followed by the UNP based government during past few months to re-gain the benefits which had later lost due to previous government?s action.
UNP Colombo district candidate Sujeewa Senasinghe said they were not able to halt the construction work or cancel the development projects such as the Chinese government funded Port City project and Colombo harbour initiated by the previous government even if several irregularities had taken place. "Therefore, we will negotiate with the investors and constructors on decreasing the expenses as possible to minimise the financial and other shortcomings," he said.
Mr. Senasinghe said new efficient systems would be established to locate further information regarding the alleged foreign bank accounts belonging to former president Mahinda Rajapaksa in many countries such as Switzerland and Saudi Arabia and to accelerate the proceedings of the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption.

MasterCard facilitates shift to chip and pin based cards
	
		 		 
		 
			
MasterCard shed light on the rising shift to EMV technology, the biggest change to hit the payment industry in over 40 years, at a workshop in Colombo recently.
With several banks in Sri Lanka having already initiated EMV migration programs, the workshop was aimed at addressing partners? concerns on the transition and helping them formulate their strategies to enable smooth adoption of this technology.
Senior bankers, technologists and service providers who took part in the forum noted that it had outlined key considerations to be kept in mind when moving to chip and pin based EMV cards helping them firm up their project pipelines.
??EMV technology protects in-store payments from counterfeit card fraud. A small computer chip built into the payment card generates a one-time use code for every transaction, making it virtually impossible to create counterfeit cards,??said?R. B. Santosh Kumar, Country Manager ? Sri Lanka and Maldives, MasterCard.
?As this shift gains momentum around the world, a global chip infrastructure is taking shape to counter the threat of fraudulent transactions. We look forward to working with our partners in Sri Lanka to bring safer payment technologies to the market.?

NAFLIA unites life insurers to launch national awareness campaign
	
Fifteen life insurance companies came together in Colombo recently to take the first step in a joint initiative to promote life insurance to a million people in September, designated Sri Lanka?s ?Life Insurance Awareness Month?.
The initiative was launched at the sixth annual conference of the National Forum for Life Insurance Advisors (NAFLIA) at the BMICH, at which Insurance Board of Sri Lanka (IBSL) Chairperson Indrani Sugathadasa presided as the chief guest.
Representatives of the 15 companies passed to each other a symbolic ?Flame of Protection? -- a stylised graphic of which will be the logo for the month-long campaign intended to extend the protection of life insurance to a targeted 75,000 families as part of NAFLIA?s goal of ?A Day All Sri Lankans Are Insured?, the theme of the 2015 conference.
?Get Life, Live Life? -- the slogan for the 2015 Life Insurance Awareness Month -- was unveiled at this event as a prelude to the September 1 launch of the campaign at the outdoor stadium of the Vihara Maha Devi Park in Colombo and the event is expected to draw about 1,500 active life insurance sales professionals.
Addressing the conference, Sugathadasa stressed that ?as an industry, we need to envision a country that is fully insured,? and expressed the view that the day all Sri Lankans are insured is a dream that the industry can make a reality sooner rather than later.
Advocating a change in the way insurance sales professionals speak about life insurance in order to improve understanding of its value, Sugathadasa urged the 900 leading life insurance advisors that attended the conference to aspire to a day when people buy life insurance, rather than have advisors selling them insurance.
She described life insurance as the modern-day ?magic? that protects people from the uncertainties of life, similar to the magic that follows tragedy in fairy tales. ?If Cinderella?s father had life insurance, she would not have had to suffer under the wicked stepmother,? Sugathadasa said in lighter vein.
The 15 life insurance companies that have come together to jointly drive awareness of the value of life insurance are AIA, Allianz, Amana Takaful, Asian Alliance, Arpico Insurance, Ceylinco Life, Cooperative Insurance, HNB Assurance, Janashakthi, LOLC Insurance, LIC, MBSL Insurance, Sanasa Insurance, SLIC and Union Assurance.
The annual NAFLIA conference is the only forum in Sri Lanka?s life insurance industry for high-flying insurance advisors. The forum is intended to enhance their professionalism, facilitate sharing of knowledge and address common interests. The insurance industry employs more than 40,000 life insurance advisors, of which the highest achievers in life insurance attend the NAFLIA conference.
