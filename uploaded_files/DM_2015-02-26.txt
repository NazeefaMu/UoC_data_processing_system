13 principals told to submit Grade-5 admission details
	
	The Supreme Court on Thursday ordered the Principals of 13 national schools including Colombo Royal College, Ananda College and Nalanda College to submit details of students admitted to Grades-1 to 6 during the past three years and those admitted to these schools in 2013 on the results of the Grade-5 scholarship examination.
The other 10 colleges are as follows: D.S. Senanayake, Isipathana, Thurstan, Mahanama, Devi Balika, Sirimavo Bandaranaike, Vishaka, Gothami Balika, Richmond College in Galle, and Rahula College in Matara.
This order was made sequent to a fundamental rights petition filed by the Ceylon Teachers Association and a group of parents being taken up for hearing by a three-judge Supreme Court bench comprising Priyasad Dep, Buwaneka Aluvihare and Upali Abeyratne. The hearing was fixed for March 31.
Thirteen petitioners filed this petition citing the 13 school principals as respondents.
The petitioners said their children had passed the Grade-5 scholarship examination in 2013 and when they sought admission to the mentioned schools they were informed that the cut-off marks had been raised when compared with the previous year and on this basis the children were refused admission to these schools.
However, inquiries had revealed that there existed a serious congestion in the Grades-2 to 5 classrooms because the approved number of 45 had been exceeded. (Ranjan Katugampola and Thilini De Silva)

A new haven where they feel at home
	
	
	It is a public secret that several white collar bigwigs enjoyed a free run in the corridors of power under the previous regime, thanks to the ready patronage of the big boss at the time.
They got the jitters when they found a pro-Maithri wave sweeping across the country with the January 8 big poll drawing closer. Plagued by their guilty conscience, what really frightened them were the ominous signals pointing to retribution to come and rushed to parts unknown on the eve of the poll or soon after the poll.
It has now come to light that some of these white collar fugitives have found a safe haven in an East Asian city, well-known for Buddhist temples and red light enclaves. 
One is said to be a top bureaucrat branded as the economic hit-man of the previous regime. A former police chief with a haunting past is also said to be holed up in the same city, they say.
Two politicos discussing the flight of the onetime highflyers when asked: Why did they seek refuge in a place yet to recover from a political upheaval
The other known for his wisecracks quipped: These chaps have been so used to a dictator-like-master, they must be feeling more at home where depots and military juntas rule the roost!

Cabinet Spokesman and Health Minister Rajitha Senaratna today charged the Police was deliberately focusing action against those who had committed minor offences to create disappointment towards the government. 
He said the priority should have been given to take action against those who were responsible for large scale corruption and committed major offences.
Wele Suda revealed that a former Police Chief and a Parliamentarian were involved in his heroin smuggling activities. Police should look into these offenders instead of concentrating the arrest of Shashi Weerawansa or Sudarman Radaliyagoda, he said. 
He said the Police should ascertain how the private television channel CSN was bought and operated. These are the offenders the Police should focus on, he said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)WATCH

UN defends delay of SL war crime probe report
	
The UN Human Rights Council defended its move to defer the release of a report into alleged war crimes committed during Sri Lanka's civil war as a very rational decision taken in a relatively unique case.
According to the PTI, the President of the UN Human Rights Council (UNHRC) Joachim Rucker on Thursday has said that the decision to defer the release of the report on the human rights violations in Sri Lanka to September was very rational.
Speaking ahead of the 28th session of the UNHRC, Rucker emphasised that both the stepping down of the Chairperson of the Commission of Enquiry on the 2014 Gaza Conflict, William Schabas and the Lanka report deferral were relatively unique cases and warned against drawing conclusions of a general nature about them.
The report, which was earlier scheduled to be released on March 25, was deferred by six months last week, following request by the newly-elected government for more time to conclude its internal probe.
However, the UN move was denounced by the Tamil National Alliance - which expressed dismay over the deferral saying justice delayed is justice denied.
President Maithripala Sirisena took power last month after defeating Mahinda Rajapaksa who had vehemently resisted cooperation with the UN mandated probe.
Sri Lanka has been subjected to three UNHRC resolutions in 2012, 2013 and 2014 over alleged rights abuses by government troops during the last phase of the three decade-long war with the LTTE in 2009.
In March last year, the 47-member UNHRC adopted a resolution which requested the Office of the High Commissioner to undertake a comprehensive investigation into alleged serious violations and abuses of human rights and related crimes by both parties in Sri Lanka during the period.
The UNHRC is an intergovernmental body within the UN system created by the General Assembly in 2006 to address situations of human rights violations and making recommendations on them.
