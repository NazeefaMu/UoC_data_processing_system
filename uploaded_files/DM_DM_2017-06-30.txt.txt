About 1,200 arrested for dumping garbage
	
About 1,200 individuals had been arrested for dumping garbage in a haphazard manner in the Western Province, the Police said today.
Releasing a statement the Police Department said the individuals were arrested between June 18 and 27.
The highest numbers of individuals were arrested from Gampaha, while Kalutara reported the lowest number of arrests.
250 were arrested from Gampaha, 215 from Central Colombo, 169 from Colombo North, 153 from Kelaniya, 140 from Nugegoda, 85 from Panadura, 72 from Colombo South, 65 from Negombo, 27 from Mount Lavinia and 4 from Kalutara, a Spokesman for the Police said.
The raids were conducted by the Police Department in collaboration with the Sri Lanka Army.
Meanwhile, speaking to the Daily Mirror previously Colombo Municipality Commissioner V. K. A. Anura said the arrests would continue in the city until individuals stopped dumping garbage in a haphazard manner in the city.
The operation commenced on June 15, was aimed at reducing the 650 metric tons of garbage collected by the Colombo Municipality within its limits, he said.
During a media conference, Anura stated that Municipality workers had cleared out at least 200 metric tons of garbage dumped haphazardly on the streets each day with most of the said waste generated from large production facilities.
We used to collect about 1,000 metric tons of garbage before we started to segregate and now we collect much less in Colombo. This is because people are more conscious of the waste they generate, he said.
Last week, Minister of Provincial Councils Faiszer Musthapha said mobile monitoring teams deployed by the Ministry had identified 2, 336 persons, while dumping garbage on roads in a haphazard manner.
He also said steps would be taken to set up street cameras to identify persons who dump garbage on the roadside and in public places.

Angela Merkel predicts showdown over climate at G-20
	
Isaac Stanley Becker  Jun 29, 2017 - BERLIN - Speaking in Germanys Parliament on Thursday, Chancellor Angela Merkel predicted a difficult meeting of the worlds major economies next week in Hamburg over the climate agreement spurned by the Trump administration. 
Despite the withdrawal of the United States, the worlds second-largest polluter, from the Paris climate agreement, the EU remains committed to it and it was not up for renegotiation, she said. 
Since the U.S. announced that it would exit the Paris agreement, we cannot expect any easy talks in Hamburg, Merkel said, referring to the Group of 20 summit.
She said talks in Hamburg must serve the substance and aims of the Paris accord and made clear that she would not countenance calls to revise the agreement to forge a global consensus around limiting greenhouse gases. 
Four weeks after President Trump announced he would take the United States out of the accord in order to negotiate a better deal, Merkel said the pact is irreversible.

Anti Corruption Committee Sec. ceases to function from tomorrow
	
The functions of the Anti-Corruption Committee Secretariat (ACCS), which determines the nature of the complaints of major corruption cases to be probed, will cease to exist from tomorrow (1) as no Cabinet nod had been received to date validating its existence, Daily Mirror learns.
The commission was established in 2015 after the Yahapalana Government came into being, to observe the public complaints on massive frauds and corruption cases of the previous regime and to refer the true complaints to its chief probing tools, the Police Financial Crimes Investigation Division (FCID) and the Commission to Investigation Allegations of Bribery or Corruption (CIABOC).
Cabinet approval for the commission was received on February 11, 2015. The ACCS was established on February 19, 2015 and was housed in an office complex next to Temple Trees off Gangaramaya.
Since then, the existence of the commission had been renewed every six months after getting special Cabinet approval five consecutive times, the last time being January 1, 2017.
However, no Cabinet approval was received for the extension of the functions of the ACCS beyond June 30 even during the last sitting of Cabinet held on Tuesday (27), the paper learns.
When contacted a senior official of the commission told Daily Mirror that they had started packing their bags since there was no response either from the Cabinet or the Prime Ministers Office.
The officials had written to the Prime Ministers Secretary three days ago inquiring about the fate of the commission. They had made a verbal inquiry too but received no response. They had written asking the authorities to send their representatives to take over the office material since their staff would not report to work from
July 1 as their term of office had expired.
When contacted, Secretary to the Prime Minister Saman Ekanayake said last evening that he had no knowledge of the prevailing situation and that the fate of the ACCS was in the hands of the commission heads.
The ACCS comprises of a Director, four Deputy Directors representing various state departments as well as a staff of about 25 professionals including officers from the State Intelligence Service. (Kurulu Koojana Kariyakarawana)

Biography of Elmo Fernando launched He always stood up against injustice
	
Sri Lanka Press Institute auditorium was packed with the well wishers gathered there for the launching of Elmo Fernando, Colamba Sita, the biography of late Elmo Fernando, the eminent radio journalist. The author of the book is Wijith Kumar Senaratne. 

Wijith, who had been a fan of Elmos voice for a long time, persuaded Elmo for an interview with the greatest difficulty. It was published in the Rawaya newspaper under the heading, Elmo Fernando Colamba Sita. The heading was inspired by his signature sign off statement during his years at BBC and was later used as the title for his biography. 
When Elmos son brought forward the idea for a biography, Elmo wanted Wijith to be the author of his life story. Working on this project together with Wijith gave Elmo the courage to fight the long battle against his illness. While his thirst to unveil the truths experienced as a journalist grew day by day, so did his malady. Even after the passing of Elmo last year, Wijith continued with his work with the help of many people including Elmos children and the members of the Elmo Fernando commemorative committee. All their efforts were brought to fruition with the launching on
May 16th.
The book is dedicated to the journalists who have fought with their lifes blood in the name of ethical journalism

The book is dedicated to the journalists who have fought with their lifes blood in the name of ethical journalism. The author takes the reader along a tour of Elmos life, starting from his childhood, through the crucial points of his life as a person as well as a journalist. His journey as a struggling announcer, his work at Veritas Radio in the Philippines, and later on at BBC, up to his retirement. During his years as a journalist, Elmo had been to many places and seen many things that an average person rarely experiences. Many of those memories such as the bombing of the Central Bank, his visits to the coastal areas immediately after the Tsunami, the challenges during the 1980s insurrections, are included in his biography.

While turning the pages, the reader comes across many instances where he is tested by life in giving him one obstacle after another. The way he overcomes each of these challenges, always taking the teachings of his religion to heart, and thinking philosophically, is a lesson to all. Even though Elmo is no more, the fragrance of his personality, that of a straightforward, compassionate man who has travelled a long distance in the road of life, could be felt throughout the book.

The Chief Guest of the event, Parliamentary Reforms and Mass Media Minister Gayantha Karunathilake commented that Elmo was a journalist that worked tirelessly to maintain the quality standards of the Sri Lankan Radio until his last breath. 
The author of the biography mentioned in his speech that Elmos voice represented the truth, and that he always managed to report news from an angle that is different from the norm. He always stood up in place of injustice, and was eager to help those in need, but he could never be bought, he further stated. This is the third book published by Wijith, who is also an experienced journalist. It is a publication of Agahas Publication House. 
The event was made more colourful with the voice of the famous radio personality Ms. Chitra Kumari Kalubowila, and was attended by many well known personalities including the former MP Tissa Aththanayake and Sumana Lellampitiya. 
The launching of the WIFI facility for journalists inside the Sri Lank Press Institute(SLPI) premises, commemorating Elmo Fernando, was conducted parallel to the book launch. Kumar Lopez, Chief executive officer of the SLPC stated that many journalists starting up their journeys will benefit from this facility, which will be turned in to a hot desk to be used by the journalists for their research and learning purposes even after the working hours.
The good name of Elmo will continue to shine even after his death, he concluded.

Chinas PLA warns India: Learn lessons from 1962 defeat...
	

India should learn lessons from its defeat in 1962 and stop clamouring for a war, China warned on Thursday, saying the precondition for settling the current stand-off in the Sikkim sector is that New Delhi withdraws its troops immediately. 
China said its troops were building a road in its own territory and not on land that belonged to Bhutan. 
Peoples Liberation Army (PLA) spokesperson Wu Qian was reacting to Indian Army chief Gen Bipin Rawats statement that India was ready to take on China, Pakistan and internal security issues. 

Such rhetoric is extremely irresponsible. We hope (the) particular person in the Indian Army could learn from historical lessons and stop such clamouring for war, he said at the monthly defence ministry briefing in Beijing, indicating Chinas aggressive position in the current dispute. 
The topic of a new 35-tonne tank, built and tested by China in the Tibet Autonomous Region (TAR), came up at the briefing, after a Chinese journalist asked whether it was better than its Indian counterparts and whether China will use it against India
in a war. A type of tank undertook trial on the (Tibet) plateau. The purpose of is to test the parameters of the equipment and is not targeted against any country, Wu said.

Chrissy Aloysius - a loving tribute
	
By Antoinette Thiruppathy 

CHRISSY ALOYSIUS passed away on the evening of April 19th, leaving behind the love of her life, Dr. Dennis J. Aloysius, our much-loved family physician of almost 20 years. Among the bereaved are her children - Rohini, Ranjini, Ranee and Rohan. Her daughter, Ruwani, predeceased her.

Chrissy and Dennis celebrated their Diamond Wedding Anniversary in 2016 and in all that time they had been separated for just five days. I am indebted to her son-in-law, Campion Fernando, for this cameo: 
At Mummys 80th Birthday party in Sydney, she only spoke of her husband Dennis until Ranee (her daughter) reminded her that she also had 5 children! This leads me to the point of this inseparable love and attachment that is only 4 weeks short of 61 years. Guess what, they have been physically apart from each other only for 5 days in the 61 years!
Chrissy ran her husbands medical clinic and his life with a gentle yet bossy hand. Chrissy called herself a Practice Manager, a combination of receptionist, secretary, research assistant and counsellor.
If I could characterise Chrissy with one word  it is effervescent. She loved life and shared with us

Hers was the voice on the telephone when we wanted an appointment. Hers was the final bye, when we left clutching the medicines from their little pharmacy. Hers was the homespun advice and counselling dispensed with so much love. 
If I could characterise Chrissy with one word  it is effervescent. She loved life and shared with us memories of happy times  whether it was a medical ball, a fund raiser or some special project. Galkissa-Ratmalana occupied a special niche in her heart for it was her husbands medical constituency. Over the years she raised funds to provide toys to tsunami-affected children in the coastal areas, reading glasses to a number of needy women and children and many suchbenevolent activities.

A founder of the Doctors Wives Association of Sri Lanka, Chrissie had steered the Association as its President since 1987 and claimed in an interview on the eve of its 25th anniversary, that so far, Sri Lanka remains the only country in the world where doctors wives have got together to form an Association such as theirs.

Chrissie won a Golden Clef Award for the lyrics of her song, This land belongs to you, this land belongs to me  a popular musical rendition by Sunil and the Gypsies. But thats not all; Chrissie also wrote and produced comic skits to perk up the Associations get-together. 
Speaking at her induction ceremony, the new President of the SLMA, Dr. Chandrika N Wijeyaratne, commented on the award of Honorary Membership to Dr. Dennis J. Aloysius who had guided the SLMA for over five decades and in a singular tribute to Chrissie, she said: 
We also felicitated another very special person, for her untiring dedication to the SLMA, and that is none other than Chrissy, c/o Hon. Member Dennis Aloysius. Her support to enliven the family of doctors over 33 years through her stewardship of the Doctors Wives Association is greatly appreciated.
Though related by marriage to the illustrious Casie Chetty clan, Chrissie Aloysius favoured no airs and graces. Instead her very simplicity and open heartedness endeared her to all who crossed her path. She was indeed a truly good and blessed human being. 
Chrissy had no patience with the digital age. While at first glance, her patients records looked disorderly and out of sync, there was actually a method in the madness. So long as you remembered your number, which she inscribed on a small card, Chrissie would access the file. One day, when I had failed to bring this card she chided me saying that I should treat it with the same care as my National Identity Card. Anyhow, taking down a dusty, dog-eared CR register, she painstakingly went through hundreds of entries until she traced my name and number. She was so delighted that I couldnt help but cheer! 
On my last visit to the Clinic about three or four weeks prior to her death, I found Chrissy in a very happy mood. There were no other patients in the waiting room, so, while I was with the Doctor, Chrissy entertained my daughter with details about her romance with Dennis - a campus love story, but above and beyond, an inspiring story of how their love had triumphed over racial barriers. Their common faith in Christianity had probably helped the process of mutual reconciliation.

When I wished Chrissy goodbye that day at the clinic, she remarked, We should meet again for a long chat, Antoinette. You can come in the morning and stay for lunch. That was never to be. Her sudden death has left us all shockedand bereft. 
God keep you in his tender care, Chrissy, and may perpetual light shine upon you and may you Rest in Peace. Amen.

Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi condemned on Thursday a string of murders targeting minorities under the pretext of protecting cows, which are considered sacred by many Hindus, after critics accused the government of turning a blind eye. 
Modis remarks --his first on vigilantism in nearly a year-- come days after a Muslim teenager was stabbed to death on a train after being accused of carrying beef. 
India has been reeling from a spate of vigilante murders in recent months, targeting Muslims and low caste Hindus accused of killing cows or consuming beef.

Mount of Venus
	
Human hand- Trail Blazer of Human Civilization  Part 15

BY A.S. Fernando.
The elevated area beneath the second phalange of the thumb surrounded by the Line of Life is called the Mount of Venus.
Venus is known as the Goddess of Love and Beauty in Greek mythology.

Represents love and sympathy
True to its name, this Mount stands for love and also for sympathy and generosity.
Persons having a prominent Mount of Venusare Venusians.

Healthy with an attractive and imposing personality
Venusians are very healthy and are endowed with an attractive and imposing personality. A person without a prominent Mount of Venus is a coward and a weakling.
The absence of the Mount shows that the owner leads a life of hardship and misery.
Venusians are brilliant and good looking.

Attract the opposite sex
Persons of the opposite sex would find Venusians enchanting. A good Head Line and a strong thumb are necessary for a Venusian to hold in check his/her inclination to seek sensual pleasures at the expense of self-respect, time and wealth.

A lover of music and fine arts
A smooth Mount not excessively large indicates that the owner is a lover of flowers, music, and fine arts in general. If the Mount of Moon is equally developed the owners aesthetic sensibilities are very strong and refined.
Venusians generally marry at an early age. Female Venusians are easily attracted to strong Martians for they find strength and vigour provocative.
Venusians are idealistic to a certain extent but they enjoy life.
The Venusian has many qualities in common with the Juputerian. But the Venusians are more tender, sympathetic and unselfish.
The Venusian is strong and healthy and has acheerful disposition

Permission denied to meet Lankan refugees
	
Tamil Nationalist political partymen (Viduthalai Chiruthaigal Katchi) in Tamil Nadu are disenchanted with the police in the district after they were reportedly denied permission on Wednesday to meet Sri Lankan Tamil refugees in the settlement in Bhavani Sagar.
The Hindu reportd that the Party functionaries led by its State deputy general secretary Vanniarasu had gone to meet the refugees who had represented to VCK leader Thol Thirumavalavan that they were hounded by functionaries of mainstream political parties when the team was not only denied permission, but also detained for about an hour.
Irked by unfair treatment at a local sports event, unidentified people in the refugee camp had torn posters of some politicians, triggering demand from the political parties for shifting of the refugee camp out of Bhavani Sagar. The VCK only intended to interact with the refugees to know the facts, said zonal organising secretary of VCK, Vinayagamoorthy. There was no rule as such that the people in refugee camp must be kept in isolation. No such situation prevails in the refugee camps in other districts, Mr. Vinayagamoorthy said.

SC dismisses Vasus FR petition
	
The Supreme Court today dismissed the Fundamental Rights petition filed by MP Vasudeva Nanayakkara seeking an order to nullify the Framework Agreement entered into by the Government with two Chinese companies to lease out the Hambantota Harbour.
The Three Judge Bench comprised of Judge Buwaneka P. Aluvihare PC, Judge Sisira J. De Abrew and Judge Anil Gunaratne inquired into the petition and dismissed observing that the petitioner had suppressed material facts of the case.
They observed that the purported agreements were signed in the years 2012 and 2013 while the petitioner had been a Cabinet Minister.
The judges said as a matter-of-fact when the agreement was signed, the petitioner was well aware about it and had intentionally and willfully suppressed the facts to the Court.
The petitioner, UPFA Parliamentarian Vasudeva Nanayakkara, had claimed that the leasing out of the Hambantota harbour and 15,000 acres of land in Hambantota to the Chinese firm, was an imminent and continuing infringement of the Fundamental Rights of the petitioner, guaranteed in terms of Article 12 (1) of the Constitution.
The petitioner had contended that by the arbitrary, capricious, mala fide, and illegal and unlawful decision of the respondents to enter into an agreement with the Peoples Republic of China for the promotion of investment in Sri Lanka by Chinese investors, and lease and convey and enter into an agreement, or in any other manner dispose approximately 15,000 acres of land and/or 50 Square Kilometres, was an infringement of the petitioners rights guaranteed by the Constitution.
The petitioner had cited as respondent, the members of the cabinet, members of the Appointed Negotiating Committee, the Director General of the Department of External Resources of the Ministry of National Policies and Economic Affairs, Sri Lanka Ports Authority, China Merchants Port Holdings Company Limited and China Communications Constructions Company, as respondents.

SriLankan airline's future: Govt. decision by July 30
	
Government will, within the next 30 days, take a final decision on the future of the countrys national carrier, Srilankan, informed sources said yesterday.
They said the government would decide whether to covert Srilankan into a public-private- partnership, a State-owned venture or to privatize it and would reveal its decisions by way of a public statement on July 30,
The sources said the International Monetary Fund (IMF) had also instructed the government to take a decision soon.
This comes amid the previous disclosure that some airlines have had informal talks with the Sri Lankan Government on partnering the national carrier. Government had also said that it was considering operating the airline on the basis of a public-private-partnership so that it would be turned into a profit-making venture. (Yohan Perera)

State has no power to interfere in Buddhist Temples: Wijeyadasa
	
The sole authority in the administration of Buddhist Temples rests in the hands of the chief prelates of these temples and hence neither the State nor any State institution has any right to interfere in their administration or to intervene in their affairs in any way, said Minister of Buddha Sasana and Justice Dr. Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe when he spoke on Wednesday at the Mahiyangana Raja Maha Viharaya.
He stressed that no state institution will be allowed to intervene or meddle with the affairs of these temples. "If the Lord Buddha was alive today, he would have thought that this is the ideal time to make his fourth visit to the island having considered the frustration prevalent in our society today".
The minister went on to say that from the time of the Kandyan Convention of 1858 till the 1978 Constitution it has been a responsibility of the government to give the pride of place to Buddhism and to nourish it. "We are working with a great awareness of this position. At a time the International Vesak Festival was celebrated in our country and a great resurgence and awakening of Buddhas teaching is taking place, it is not a shock that people with ulterior motives are trying to undermine this resurgence. Facing these moves is not an issue for us," he said.
"We were very hurt by come of what is being said in the media with regards to our temples. There are reports of financial misappropriation taking place at the Rangiri Dambulu Raja Maha Viharaya. I as the Buddha Sasana Minister wish to clarify our position in this regard. Our responsibility does not end with only protecting temples. Among the Nikayas there are traditions that have gone on for thousands of years.
For example the Asgiriya Chapter has traditions handed down from the Anuradhapura era and the Malwatta Chapter too is the same. The Asgiriya Maha Viharaya Karaka Sangha Sabha controls many temples around it including the administration of the Athkanda Viharaya where the Anunayake Thera resides and this Mahiyangana Raja Maha Viharaya, Muthiyangana Raja Maha Viharaya, Rangiri Dambulu Viharaya and the Rambewa Viharaya in a manner that is different to the administration of ordinary temples. They are administered under a special system, by the Asgiriya chapter. During the recent past there was criticism and allegations with regard to the running of the Rangiri Dambulu Viharaya by the Cultural Triangle and institutions such as the Archaeological Department.
It should be noted that the present incumbent of the Rangiri Raja Maha Viharaya, Dr. Godagama Mangala Thera was not the Chief Incumbent during the time the alleged discrepancies took place. Therefore the Cultural Triangle and the Archaeological Department should probe these irregularities and take action against those who were there at the time when these alleged incidents took place. No one has the right to put the blame on the Sangha for this,"he said.
The Minister made these remarks while participating at a ceremony to ordain 48 novice monks at the Mahiyangana Raja Maha Viharaya.

Tales of woe from  beyond prisons Families of prisoners: Invisible victims  of imprisonment
	
A prisoner who has committed a crime as heinous as murder cannot be pardoned easily. Though the rights of prisoners are a much talked topic the world over, the plight of their families who have not committed any crime, is largely invisible. Their predicament is concealed from the worlds view. Activists point out that there is no effective framework to cater to their needs and as a result they have fallen into dire poverty, which in turn has resulted in extremely negative social consequences. In the light of this revelation Dailymirror.lkspoke to family members of prisoners, the relevant authorities, and members of welfare societies. The family members we spoke to, shared their heart wrenching tales of desperation of coping with social stigma, battling the economic burden and the emotional trauma that has followed the imprisonment.
Accordingly, Dailymirror.lk learned that an imprisonment of a family member has led to such economic instability in the family, that in certain instances the women have no choice but to resort to prostitution. The case hearing drags on for years on end in courts until the verdict is delivered and the fee to hire a lawyer cripples the familys economy. When the verdict is finally delivered and the accused family member is taken away, the family has nothing to live on. Adding to their misery, villagers and relatives stigmatize them. The education of their children is disrupted due to the mental distress caused by the change of events. Wives of prisoners told us that they were sexually harassed due to the absence of their husband. 
The government claims that there is a welfare system in place under the Prison Department to address the needs of
these families.
Families of prisoners are eligible to Samurdhi benefits provided that their low financial status is proven. However, it is questionable as to whether the assistance provided is adequate to remove the family out of the mire of poverty and the detrimental consequences associated with it. Sources point out that these welfare mechanisms only provide meagre financial assistance which is insufficient to live on. 
Dailymirror.lk spoke to family members of prisoners who are serving the death row, life sentence and those who have appealed against their conviction. According to the latest annual progress report released by the Ministry of Prison Reforms, as at August 31, 2016, there have been 447 prisoners serving their life sentence while another 98 have appealed against it. Three hundred and twenty seven prisoners have been sentenced to death while another 678 prisoners have appealed against it. A vast majority of these prisoners are males.
When my husband was around my son used to be the first in the class, but not any more
-K. Udayamawa from Gammaduwa
There is no one to take care of us. I sew clothes for a living. My son is to sit for the scholarship exam this year. He has been deeply affected by my husbands conviction. When my husband was around my son used to be the first in the class, but not any more., wept K. Udayamawa from Gammaduwa whose husband is imprisoned at the Pallekelle prison.

We dont have a house and we stay at my mothers. My brother doesnt walk into this house because of our presence. We dont know where else to stay. I live because of my children. I am 29 years old now. I cant walk on the road. People leer at me, she said. It is better if we had been imprisoned alongside my husband. 
I have beaten four men so far in desperation as a last resort to save my life
-M.P. Rupakanthifrom Kegalle
I cant walk on the road alone because men follow me knowing that my husband is in prison. They follow me to my house and I can no longer stay at home alone. I have beaten four men so far in desperation as a last resort to save my life, said M.P. Rupakanthi from Kegalle. Her husband has been sentenced to death and though she has appealed against the conviction she is no longer hopeful. I have appealed, but I cant hire a lawyer with the meagre amount of money I get from making bricks, she said. 

The family tries to hide the truth from children and provide for them financially
-W.M.A. Wijesundara from Bandarawela
W.M.A. Wijesundaras brother and two relatives have been sentenced to death and are imprisoned at the Bogambara prison. My brothers wife is 32 years old. She has three children and she is unemployed because she has to look after her kids who are very young. The family tries to hide the truth from the children and provide for them financially, she said.

We can visit him once a week. But due to economic difficulties we do not. The last time we visited him was on April 13, she added while suppressing a sob. 
Men trouble us. Im very scared for my daughters safety
-Asoka Weerasooriya from Polonnaruwa
We only cook one meal a day. I rarely visit my husband because I dont have money to make the trip. Men trouble us. My daughter is only 14-years-old. Im very scared for her safety. I sew clothes for a living.
We are very poor. When the case was heard at the High Court I had to pay Rs. 65,000 to the lawyer for one hearing for around 15 years. Now we have nothing as a result, said Asoka Weerasooriya from Polonnaruwa. 
People often reproach me calling my son a murderer
-Sitha Kumari from Kurunegala
We are very poor. My husband is dead. My daughters son is a disabled soldier. People often reproach me calling my son a murderer, said Sitha Kumari (58) from Kurunegala. Her 40-year-old son is currently serving a life sentence at the Bogambara prison for murder. When my son was 16 years old he was forced by a contractor to get involved in the murder, she added.

- Inoka Priyadarshani from Polonnaruwa
Inoka Priyadarshanis husband has been sentenced to death for murder and he is currently imprisoned at the Bogambara prison. She said that she was being sexually harassed constantly wherever she went. There are people trying to take undue advantage of me because my husband is in prison, away from home. I cant tell anyone that my husband is not with me because I get harassed. Men have asked me for my phone number many times, she said. 
I get Samurdhi benefits through which I was able to build a house. Villagers help me in buying books for my children. School does not take money from my children for anything, she added.

Relatives dont talk to usany more
-Ramani Padmalatha from Nelumdeniya
I have a 21-year-old daughter who is studying at the Sabaragamuwa University. I make and sell rice packets as a living. I have to spend around Rs. 20,000 for my daughters studies and food, said Ramani Padmalatha, whose husband is serving his term at the Welikada prison.

Relatives dont talk to us any more. We have been cut off from the family. But villagers have been supportive, she added.
Despite economic difficulties I will educate my children
- Sureka Damayanthi from Polonnaruwa
Sureka Damayanthi from Polonnaruwa said that despite economic difficulties she aimed at educating her children.
I sell food packets to a school as a living. We get Samurdhi benefits and occasionally we get funds, she said. Her husband and brother have been convicted of murder in 2015.
The suspect may have committed an offence, but why should the innocent family and children suffer 
-Dr. Prathiba Mahanamahewa
Speaking to the Daily Mirror former Commissioner of the Human Rights Commission Dr. Prathiba Mahanamahewa said that poor women of imprisoned husbands often became prostitutes to cope up with financial difficulties. Revealing the findings of an in-depth research on problems faced by prisoners, he narrated the story of a woman from a very rich family who married a man who was later arrested on suspicion of theft, burglary and robbery. After marriage the womans family terminated all relationships with her. The couple settled and had two children. Thereafter the husband was arrested and now he is serving his term at the Welikada prison. The wife is desperate. There is no income to support the family. They have become very poor that she had to sell her body to live, he said. 
He added, The children of these prisoners get involved in illicit activities and become drug addicts. There are no State obligations or State policies to look after them.

Emphasizing that there was no welfare system to address the problems of prisoners families he said, Do we have any funds to support them Most families of prisoners are vulnerable. The government does not look after them. The suspect may have committed an offence, but why should the innocent family and children suffer 
He further pointed out that the family was not given due recognition by society. Society does not treat them humanely. They are stigmatized. Then they develop a revengeful attitude towards society, and end up doing various anti-social things in the country. 
No one has investigated into their problems. The government is not much interested. There is no line ministry to look after them. Why should innocent families suffer he quizzed. 
Welfare is for victims. We should clearly clarify that families of prisoners are victims. There must be an amendment to the Ministry of Social Welfare or there should be a Department called the Ministry of Social Justice
He further reflected on a lecture he delivered on Womens Day to an audience comprising 380 female prisoners. The children of these women live with them in prisons. What about their future 
Asked if the welfare of prisoners families should come under the Ministry of Social Empowerment and Welfare Dr. Mahanamahewa said that there was no regulation or law mandating it. Welfare is for victims. We should clearly clarify that families of prisoners are victims. There must be an amendment to the Ministry of Social Welfare or there should be a Department called the Ministry of Social Justice, which is found in some countries to address the welfare of prisoners families, he said. He pointed out that in developed countries like Australia there were no prisons. There are correction centres instead. There is no capital punishment or rigorous punishment. What we need is to rehabilitate these prisoners, he added.
There is a welfare system to address the problems of families of prisoners 
-S.B. Dissanayake
Speaking to dailymirror.lk the Minister of Social Empowerment and Welfare, S.B. Dissanyake said that there was a welfare system to address the problems of families of prisoners. There are various types of welfare programmes conducted by the government. There is a programme under the Samurdhi movement to cater to the needs of those whose breadwinners have been jailed. There is a huge welfare organization under the Prison Department to help prisoners families around the country as well, he said.
Prisoners Welfare Assoc. inquires and provides assistance through the GN in the area
-Thushara Upuldeniya Media Spokesman 
The Prisons Media Spokesman, Thushara Upuldeniya said that there were two ways in which the welfare of families of prisoners was addressed. The prisoner makes a request to us asking us to assist his family in educating his children etc. Then we inform the divisional secretariat in the area of this family and their needs, he said.

He added that there was a Prisoners Welfare Association under the Prison Department. When we inform the Association of any needy family, they inquire and provide assistance through the Grama Niladari in the area and through the school. The association provides school supplies annually. If a scholarship is needed they arrange for it. There have been 300 such monetary scholarships granted for this year, he said.
Money given to prisoners family only for three months and not thereafter
-Senarath Udagedara
Families of five receive Rs. 800 for three months. If there are less than five members the family gets Rs. 500. This is given only for three months and not thereafter. Selected families get school supplies during the week dedicated for prisoners. It provides opportunities for self-employment as well, said Senarath Udagedara, a member of the Bogambara Prisoners Welfare Association.
There are people who are imprisoned for six months unable to payRs. 1000 as fine
-Senarath Ranasinghe
Senarath Ranasinghe, a member of the Dumbara Prisoners Welfare Association said that though the Association did much for the welfare of prisoners family, they could do more if the stringent process currently followed to provide assistance is relaxed.

A family will be given Rs. 500 for three months which amounts to a total of Rs.1,500. A family member has to come to the prison each month to sign and get the money. If this person comes in a three-wheeler there is nothing left. In any case what can you do with Rs. 500 a month You could make this into Rs.1,000 and pay the amount for three months (Rs. 3,000) at once, causing less hassle, Ranasinghe, who is also a rehabilitation officer under the department of Prisons, said.
A family will be given Rs. 500 for three months which amounts to a total of Rs.1,500. A family member has to come to the prison each month to sign and get the money.

He further said that though the Association could assist prisoners who have been unable to pay minor fines, the paper work involved delayed the process. This is time consuming. Hence it takes months to get the person released when he could have been released fast. There are people who are imprisoned for six months unable to pay Rs. 1,000 or one year unable to pay Rs. 5,000. There should be new rules and regulations with which you could get things done faster. 
Elaborating further on how the process could be quickened to get maximum benefit out of the assistance that can be provided, he said, The process involved in handing an equipment or machine to assist in self-employment, for instance, takes months on end.

Taming  that lunatic fringe
	
Dr. Dayan Jayatilleka in his reply to my column last week points out certain ontological and ideological inaccuracies I made. In particular, he takes me to task over my categorising him as a nationalist and a moderate federalist, though I placed those terms in a certain context which, yes, can be mischievously reconfigured by someone against him. Point taken, point conceded. I apologise for the mistakes and I sincerely hope he wasnt inconvenienced by them. This weeks column, however, is not about Dr. Dayan, but about the responses he and his group got courtesy of my article. 
I have come to believe that no constructive debate in this country is possible without two fundamental premises: the ability to accommodate opposing view points and the ability to constructively critique those view points. The problem is that we dont know how to accommodate and we dont know what constructive means. So we pin the youre-biased tag on those we cross swords with, forgetting that we are no better and in fact are in certain respects worse than them.

I neither support nor oppose Gotabaya Rajapaksa. I believe that he did something during his tenure at the UDA, though what he did was badly tempered by what he failed to do and/or unfortunately let slip through his hands. I believe that despite his authoritarian streak, he got Colombo (and nearly every other suburb, this writers home town being one of them) cleaned and adorned. But I also believe that he is, like every other political figure we hedge our bets on, flawed. Taken by itself, this means nothing: we are all flawed, and doting on the mans perceived goodness is no worse than doting on those who are virulently opposed to him.

I believe that he did something during his tenure at the UDA, though what he did was badly tempered by what he failed to do and/or unfortunately let slip through his hands. I believe that despite his authoritarian streak, he got Colombo cleaned and adorned
Getting back to my earlier point, in as much as the likes of Dr. Dayan will be pivotal in bringing together those aforementioned two camps by 2020, it is true also that Gotabaya himself will be instrumental in reconciling them to one another. Its a circle that goes around both ways: the theoretician uniting two broadly similar movements via a figure who concurrently by his very presence brings them together. 
Underlying that, incidentally, is another point. As important, as relevant. 
I suggested a few weeks ago that the dividing line between those two camps is based on what each of them privileges. With respect to the Yuthukama Sanwada Kavaya and Jathika Chinthanaya camp, its an almost mythical idealisation of the Sinhalese and the Buddhists, which brings them closer to the likes of Anagarika Dharmapala and the failed (or stalled) project of finding a successor to him.With respect to Project Gotabaya, its a largely economistic, rationalistic, and cosmopolitan idealisation of the man at the centre of their movement. The only difference between the cosmopolitanism of this second camp and that of those opposed to them (i.e.supporters of the present regime) is that the latter are, I dare say, culturally apathetic.
The yahapalanist liberals continue to conflate it with majoritarianism. They are only partly correct: the truth is that the BBS scrounged up barely 0.2% of the votes at the 2015 General Election, compared to the 4.87% the JVP got. The majoritarians were voting in large numbers for their preferred candidates: they didnt care about the lunatic, racialist, neo-fascist fringe
And not for no reason. The truth is that many of those liberals (yahalapalanist or ex-yahapalanist) are blind to the need for a government, any government, to legitimise historical realities. Some of them (I should think many of them) seem to believe that the best way to shut out majoritarian dissent is by (what else) shutting it out altogether. This is risky, if not dangerous: it erases away any democratic space for the majoritarian right to vent out its frustration. 
To be sure, its difficult to think of a rational, cohesive, and just way of opposing the Bodu Bala Sena and those complicit in its political rise. The yahapalanist liberals continue to conflate it with majoritarianism. They are only partly correct: the truth is that the BBS scrounged up barely 0.2% of the votes at the 2015 General Election, compared to the 4.87% the JVP (which by the way was in a rather disadvantaged position owing to its vaguely articulated stances) got. The majoritarians were voting in large numbers for their preferred candidates: they didnt care about the lunatic, racialist, neo-fascist fringe. But in what those liberals are correct, they are correct all the way, almost unconditionally: the BBS is opposed by everyone, and by everyone I include supporters of the Joint Opposition, the SLFP, and the UNP. 
If 1956 is anything to go by, folks, constricting such an outlet will do more harm than good.
Going by comments I have obtained from hardcore anti-yahapalanist majoritarians, I can verify that their (mild) support for the BBS has not transformed into votes, or a sizeable electorate, to be reckoned with. It doesnt take a political scientist to figure out that the more anti-Buddhist the mainstream parties are perceived to be, the more likely it is that such a dangerous situation will become a reality. And it doesnt take a political scientist to figure out what the government must possess to prevent that risk from turning into a reality. Not irrational frenzy, but sober decisiveness. 
Project Gotabaya believes in Gotabaya Rajapaksa as the epitome of sober decisiveness. The mans occasional outbursts in the past, however, point at anything but sober decisiveness. But that is not my issue. My issue is that by idealising and depending on a single role model (for the lack of a better term), we are feeding into complacency. Complacency wont get us anywhere. Only constructive debate will.The tragedy here is that the oppositional space needed for such a debate is being denied to the spokespersons of Project Gotabaya. Its a tragedy because the Jathika Chinthanaya and Yuthukama Sanwada Kavaya, an extension of the Nalin de Silva and Gunadasa Amarasekera led coterie of nationalists, have congealed into a class and an oppositional space of their own, courtesy of their more reckonable history when it comes to combating their opponents, the anti-nationalist right and left. 
Now you may agree or disagree with some of the key figureheads behind this movement: with Nalin de Silva, Gunadasa Amarasekara, Manohara de Silva, Gomin Dayasiri, and Gevindu Cumaratunga. I wont say that I disagree (indeed I find myself agreeing with many of their contentions) but I will concede that they compel from those yahapalanist liberals the same sobriquet that Dr. Dayan, in a series of debates conducted with their movement in the eighties, bestowed on them: intellectual protectionists. Yes, they are intellectual protectionists to most. But these intellectual protectionists have been fighting their intellectual skirmishes for over three decades. Thats something Project Gotabaya will take time to equal, though in equalling it. I think there is a major role that they, in particular Dr. Dayan, will get to play. 
Which in a brief, pithy sense is as follows. In a context where most of the yahapalanist liberals are opposed to the Bodu Bala Sena because of their veiled anti-Buddhism and anti-intellectualism, we need a force that is at once sensitive to the collective being wooed by racialist outfits and also opposed to those outfits. The one doesnt negate the other, I believe: the fact that one is sensitive to Sinhala Buddhists doesnt mean that one is hell-bent against other collectives. To contend otherwise would be to say that all Sinhala Buddhists are complicit in the rise of the BBS. They are not. 
On the contrary: until we sort out this contradiction, which is really an artificial and simplistic dichotomy, there wont be any hope for any oppositional outfit to legitimately challenge the status quo, by which I am referring not to this regime, but rather to the anti-majoritarian elite who are denying any democratic outlet for the majority to resolve their grievances. If 1956 is anything to go by, folks, constricting such an outlet will do more harm than good. For everyone. And I think Project Gotabaya, at least to a certain extent, will be assessed by how well it drives home that point. Personally speaking, I dont think its doing a bad job there. At least, not yet.

Traits of Number person
	


People represented by Number 3 are dynamic and creative. However, they lack organizing ability.


Number 1 represents male and Number 2 female. The union of these numbers is children.

Every religion or philosophy in the world is based on three fundamentals or principles.


First let us consider things both abstract and tangible represented by Number 3. Some of them are creativity, children, happiness, expansion, expression, art, diversification, sociability, communication, jealousy, pride, inspiration, trinity and triangle.

What Number 3 represents and whys and wherefores for it
Number 3 represents the above with reason. We propose to give a few examples: Number 1 represents male and Number 2 female. The union of these numbers is children. The union of the two numbers on the other hand leads to creativity. Every religion or philosophy in the world is based on three fundamentals or principles. The entire philosophy of the Buddha is based on the principles of Dukkha (Suffering), Anitya (Impermanence), and Anatma (Soullessness). Father, Son and Holy Spirit are the trinity that underpins Christianity. Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva form the trinity in Hinduism. Number 3 represents the triangle formed with the three laterals force, matter and consciousness.

Characteristics Number 3 persons represent
People represented by Number 3 are dynamic and creative. However, they lack organizing ability. They possess mental keenness and capacity for good judgment.
They are religious and orthodox in outlook. They are good conversationalists with winning manners.
Number 3 people are both creative and innovative and very often their skills blossom more by accident than by design, thanks to the inspiration and help from another person.
Number 3 people are ambitious and very often reach high positions. They are sticklers for discipline. They are methodical in their work and love neatness and symmetry. They are equal to any formidable task and responsibility sits easy on them.
Number 3 people hate subordinate positions but once tasked with a responsibility they would carry it out with commitment. They are good communicators capable of putting across their message to others very effectively.

Influence of Jupiter at birth
If Jupiter is weak at the time of birth, a Number 3 person would manifest the weak qualities the Number 3 represents: laziness, pessimism and extravagance.
A Number 3 person would command the qualities that the Number 3 represents in full measure if Jupiter is strong at the time of birth or was born on a Thursday between December 16 and January 14 or March 15 and April 13 or if born in the hour of Jupiter.

TRASHING UNSUSTAINBLE DEBT THAT LEADS TO GARBAGE LIVES
	
Thirty-three years ago, I was a soil and concrete technician and labourer on the Maduru-Oya dam project, working for the Canadian consortium of FAFJ, when I first came into contact with the true peoples of our beautiful land  the vedda community. I was no tourist and they were not interested in tourists. Instead, they lived with the earth, off the earth and over a period of months when I was permitted into their wadis and their world, they taught me much. Of the many things they taught me and coloured and flavoured my worldview for all time, two stand out. The first was the sanctity and non-negotiability of the continuance of all sentient life and the second was the importance of maintaining the balance and harmony of the human-environment interface with all its attendant complexities, nuances and surprises to live guilt-free and debt-free with respect to the future. In an era where few people even knew the meaning of the word, I was given an advanced course in sustainability by the kings and queens of this practice and to them I owe a debt that cannot be repaid. 
The habit of complaining, manipulating, gossiping to suppress others and project ones self as greater must be replaced by the habit of lauding, championing, discussing and highlighting the good in others regardless of what it costs one
Speaking of non-payable debt, we have about 80 trillion dollars of cash in the world, of which about 65 trillion is usable. The global public debt is 59 trillion dollars and growing at 7 million dollars a minute, while the total debt is 199 trillion dollars  three times the amount of cash there is to cover it. The total global debt is currently at an eye-popping, heart-stopping 325% of the global gross domestic product. 1.2 quadrillion dollars of what is tantamount to funny-money is invested in derivatives alone. Much like drug-addicts in thought, word and deed, we are living on a puff of smoke and a clutch of dreams where there is absolutely no possibility of wealth creation  only debt escalation. This essentially means two things. 
One, everyone is over their eyeballs in debt to everyone else and when we build our houses, buy our cars, acquire our little electronic gadgets and appliances, put our kids through college and continuously seek acquisition of things that make us feel that we are living civilized and developed lives, we are not displaying our wealth. Instead we are living our lives sloshing around in a toxic vat of unsustainable debt. 

To become sustainable, to pull ourselves out of the global bind of debt, we must think smart, think collective, think coperative, think together. We are not trying to create processes or technologies that require massive borrowings and merely result in top-heavy monopolies or massive machines that remove human beings from the life-loop and log every dime in profit to the bank accounts of a few individuals
Two, most of us are living a shallow, blatant lie where we believe we live in comparative affluence when in fact, we live in abject poverty. It is not that hard to understand that poverty is not a measure of what one doesnt have but rather, a measure of what one wants. Whenever we want more money, a bigger estate, higher qualifications, more recognition and power and position - we are becoming poorer. Living in an age of snowballing needs and wants, we necessarily live in a world of snowballing paucity, unhappiness, unrequited needs and unfulfilled desires. So lustful are we for stuff that every time we pay off a small debt, we are immediately thinking of acquiring twice the debt as soon as possible to feed our next wave of needs. Greed then is the primary driver of individual poverty and, regardless of the socioeconomic stratum into which each of us is slotted, let us be under no illusion that we are all living beyond our means. 
I am not going to pull my punches here friends, because if I do, then I cannot be considered anyones friend. This is a pitiable, shameful, wasteful, garbage of an existence far dirtier than the physical garbage that we generate that is the outcome of the gunk in our own minds. Regardless of where we are, what we are, we must understand that we are a bunch of stinkers, de-sanitising the world in a whirlwind of mental and physical filth. Unlike the lives of the adivasivarigaya who spend more than half their lives preserving and regenerating the resources they have for future generations, we have cannibalized a few hundred years worth of earths resources earmarked for the future - just to live a few hundred months ourselves. Continue this way and we will not have life on earth in a few hundred years. 
The world is indeed in grave, grave trouble and very few of us realize it or even want to. To realize it is to understand that everything we have valued is valueless, everyone we honour is without honour themselves, every method, system, process and science we trust is as untrustworthy as a pit of vipers
The world is indeed in grave, grave trouble and very few of us realize it or even want to. To realize it is to understand that everything we have valued is valueless, everyone we honour is without honour themselves, every method, system, process and science we trust is as untrustworthy as a pit of vipers. Yet, all is not lost for us in Sri Lanka because we havent completely bought into the great lie of the industrial age. Our culture, traditions and spiritual systems have protected us. We can become safer. We can become more durable. We can become more resilient. But, to do so, we absolutely must make the effort to remove the vision-impairing pastel-shaded glasses we have been trained to wear and resolve to see things as they are. In that respect, the most important vision we must have is that we are not, repeat NOT, a developing country trying to become a developed country. We are a country that the horror of the industrial age labelled as a developing country but which is, in fact, simply a country that is trying to become a sustainable one. We are not going to damn ourselves by trying to imitate developed countries, nor are we going to visit upon our people the stressful, competitive, miserable twilight existences that are the tragic legacy left for our brothers and sisters in those countries. NO! 
To become sustainable, to pull ourselves out of the global bind of debt, we must think smart, think collective, think coperative, think together. We are not trying to create processes or technologies that require massive borrowings and merely result in top-heavy monopolies or massive machines that remove human beings from the life-loop and log every dime in profit to the bank accounts of a few individuals. What we have to do is create appropriate methods and technologies that help individuals to ease their lives and livelihoods. 
We are looking to create small apps that will collectivize and synergize the physical effort of many people not killer programmes that literally kill that effort. We are looking to use drones, small-scale dispensers and tiny-payload delivery systems that will help improve the precision of our agricultural methodology, not create next generation airplanes that over-deliver on inputs and force under-delivery of produce. We are looking to create many thousands of inventors and entrepreneurs helping, learning and sharing with each other and not one or two monopolists. 
We are looking to launch the happiness, fairness and contentment motives to the top of everyones minds  not just a few. To do that, we cannot approach such exercises with the profit motive on top of our minds. Indeed, while profit is a happy outcome, it is not a primary goal. It is not even a tertiary goal. Instead, if it happens, then it should happen as a collateral outcome of more critical activities. 
This is a tough, tough task folks, and I do not say it is not. Habit dies hard if it dies at all. However, the choice here is whether the habit dies or you die and there is no workaround that stark reality. Killing the root of this evil will require a few habits to be replaced. The habit of hoarding wealth and resources must be replaced by the habit of sharing both. The habit of competition must be replaced by the habit of cooperation. The habit of defaulting to individualism must be replaced by the habit of defaulting to collectivism. The habit of complaining, manipulating, gossiping to suppress others and project ones self as greater must be replaced by the habit of lauding, championing, discussing and highlighting the good in others regardless of what it costs one.
Most of us are living a shallow, blatant lie where we believe we live in comparative affluence when in fact, we live in abject poverty
In short, the habit of greed must be replaced by the habit of contentment. 
Let me wish ourselves good luck as we dig our heels in and embark on this painful yet rewarding journey towards personal salvation, future-proofing our nation and ensuring global emancipation. We will need it.

Vatican treasurer denies sex abuse chargess
	
The Washington Post  Jun 29, 2017 -  ROME - One of the most senior Vatican officials to be charged with sex offenses denied on Thursday the allegations levied against him by Australian police, saying he would take a leave of absence todefend himself. 
Speaking to reporters in the Vatican, Cardinal George Pell denounced relentless character assassination in the media and confirmed he would return to his native Australia to face the charges. Australian police earlier Thursday announced that Pell faces multiple charges of historical sexual assault offenses, that nations term for charges related to past conduct. 
The controversy is a challenge to Pope Francis attempts to address the churchs long-running abuse scandal, particularly since many of the details of the Australian issues were well-known at the time the pontiff appointed him to his current role.
