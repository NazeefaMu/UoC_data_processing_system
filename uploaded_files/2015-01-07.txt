Tail section of AirAsia flight found
	
The tail of AirAsia Flight 8501 has been found in the Java Sea, the head of Indonesia's search and rescue agency said Wednesday.
"The tail has been found," Bambang Soelistyo, chief of the rescue agency, known as BASARNAS, told reporters at a news conference, adding that tail numbers were visible on wreckage. Finding the tail is significant because it may contain the plane's voice and data recorders, or black boxes. Soelistyo said no black boxes have yet been found.
Tony Fernandes, CEO of AirAsia, said on Twitter Wednesday that "if right part of tail section then the black box should be there."
"We need to find all parts soon so we can find all out (sic) guests to ease the pain of our families," Fernandes said. "That still is our priority."
The Airbus A320 disappeared on Dec. 28 with 162 people on board as the jet flew from Surabaya to Singapore. The pilot had requested a course change due to bad weather just before contact was lost, officials have said. 40 bodies have been recovered so far.
If the black boxes are located, they would contain "maybe 90 per cent of the information you need in the investigation," Jean-Paul Troadec, who was in charge of the official French air accident investigation agency at the time of the Air France 447 crash, told NBC News. (nbcnews)

Amith said that four Police officers were present during the incident.
?Four Police officers of the Maligawatta Police Station watched the entire incident but did nothing to prevent us being assaulted. They were in uniform and stood still.

Thereafter, the journalist and his friend had been taken by the Police to the Maligawatta Police Station, where they had lodged a complaint, before he was admitted to the National Eye Hospital for injuries in the eye.

Govt. concerned over ?misplaced? UN statement
	
The Government had expressed its concern over the recent remarks of the Spokesperson of the Secretary-General of the United Nations recalling the Secretary-General?s call to the Government to ensure that the forthcoming Presidential elections were peaceful and inclusive, a media release said today.
?The Government of Sri Lanka notes with concern the recent remarks by the Spokesperson of the Secretary-General of the United Nations recalling the Secretary-General?s call to the Government to ensure that the forthcoming Presidential elections are peaceful and inclusive.
Issuing the statement the External Affairs Ministry said that the spokesperson?s comments were gratuitous and inappropriate.
?Sri Lanka has a vibrant tradition of democratic practice since 1931 and has been conducting elections at regular intervals, in a peaceful and orderly manner, while the electorate has continued to cast their vote freely, in large numbers.?
?In keeping with this decades-old tradition, the Presidential Election of 2015 too is being held in a peaceful and orderly manner. The inclusiveness of the elections is guaranteed for all Sri Lankans and all minorities are equally facilitated to actively participate in the election process and exercise their franchise.?
?The Commissioner of Elections is an independent authority, and as mandated, has guaranteed that the elections would be held in a free and fair manner. There is a large contingent of international election observers present. In this context, repeated calls for a free and fair election in Sri Lanka are misplaced,? the statement added.

Oman Air launches Shape and Size efficiency programme
	
Oman Air has launched an efficiency programme, entitled Shape and Size, with the aim of achieving substantial reductions in the airline?s expenditure.The move is timed to coincide with the start of 2015 and the onset of new budgets for the year.
The Shape and Size efficiency programme is targeting cost reductions across all activities undertaken by the national carrier of the Sultanate of Oman. None of those reductions will affect the airline?s safety or the high standards of service offered to valued customers.
A total reduction in expenditure of more than 100 million OMR should be achieved by Oman Air over the next three years, bringing the company to an operational break-even point by the end of 2017.
The Chief Executive Officer of Oman Air, Paul Gregorowitsch said: ?We are determined and committed to reshape Oman Air to become a more modern business driven enterprise- one that does not solely rely on financial injections from the Government of Oman.
?Oman Air contributed almost 420 million OMR to the Gross National Product of the Sultanate during 2014. We are also aware that we have to contribute to the infrastructure of the country by serving domestic airports like Sohar. Furthermore, and in line with the nation?s Omanisation policy, we are committed to developing for the future the educational and career potential of young Omanis. These important duties do not, however, constitute an excuse to run the airline as though it is a hobby.
?We all have to work hard and to make sacrifices to become an even better, service oriented, but self-supporting airline. We are in business to be customer and profit-driven.On January 15th, more than 400 Oman Air employees are to attend ?To become the best?, a global event held in Muscat. Here they will be briefed on how to contribute more effectively to the development of an efficient, profitable and respected airline.

SLT denies that election results could be cooked
	
Sri Lanka Telecom PLC (SLT) today categorically denied an item published on a website alleging that those who know the SLT terminal line password could alter the results of today?s presidential election.
SLT Group Chief Executive Officer Lalith De Silva, at a hurriedly called media briefing at the SLT Head Office in Colombo, said that they were making arrangements to take legal action against the particular website.
?Initially, as was our duty, we informed Elections Commissioner Mahinda Deshapriya on Wednesday about the issue. He called us for a meeting yesterday, where he also agreed that the allegation was false and condemned the act. We will decide what legal action to take against the website later on,? he said.
He said Mr. Deshapriya had averred that his decision to assign the SLT as the telecommunication network provider for election purposes was taken because of the trustworthiness of the company.
Mr. Silva said that these allegations at a time close to the poll would damage the image of the company and also impact on the credibility of the poll results, especially internationally.
Elaborating, Chief Network Officer Priyantha Fernando said they were in no position to alter the election results but that those who didn?t sufficient technical knowledge would be misled by the article.
?The article specifically says that the SLT could only alter results by ?faxes?. This is not possible and is a completely false statement. We don?t connect routers to the PSTN as alleged in the article. And even if the fax were altered, the emails and the results received through other means would be the same,? he said. ?
