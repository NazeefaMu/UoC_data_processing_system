Bike gang vandalizes three houses in Jaffna
	
A bike gang had vandalized three houses in Jaffna, Kopai and Chunnakam yesterday, Police said.
They said the gang had entered the houses by force and caused damages.
In the incidents of Kopai and Jaffna, the nine members who had come in three motor bikes have been identified as members who had left the ?Awa gang? whereas in the incident of Chunnakam, there was no connection in this regard.?
The victim of the Jaffna incident, who had lodged a complaint to the Police, had been recognized as a close associate of Awa gang.?
Accordingly, the Police suspect that the particular gang may be at loggerheads with the Awa gang associates.
However, the police have identified some of the suspects in relation to the incidents and operations are underway as to arrest them. (Sheain Fernandopulle)??

Chairs, Conveniences, Compensation, Councils? Coffers...
	
While CM plays the fiddle, Mayoress is gearing up
?
?
?
Western Provincial Council (WPC) and Colombo Municipal Council (CMC), unlike our ?cash strapped? treasury are inundated with extra cash, as proudly claimed by Chief Minister Isuru Devapriya and the Mayoress Rosy Senanayake. They, as reported, are on a shopping spree for chairs, toilet accessories and aspiring for extravagant Thamashas and enhanced compensation for councilors. Both these politicians who are close allies of the President and the Prime Minister have made somewhat surprising and similar explanations saying ?we are spending our money, our coffers are overflowing with funds?.?
?
WPC Governor temporarily halted the purchase
	?
	125 chairs each costing the WPC? Rs. 650,000/!
	?
	Rosy proposed compensation package to council members
	?
?
The luxurious extravagant new office and Chamber at the Western Provincial Council, another ?white elephant? needs chairs for the hundred odd elected members to conduct the affairs of the three districts. In CMC the top ranked officials of the funding agents and IMF ?who frequent the place? for making Colombo the golden city of Asia had no proper place to sit and discuss important projects. Hence the first citizen who holds the key to the city chose her official residence as the meeting place, but found the toilets in a dilapidated condition. For the modernization of the toilets at the Colombo Mayoress? official residence, it was rumoured, had allocated Rs 5.7 million. When public conveniences within the city were in such a unhygienic condition as revealed by CMC member Sumith Passaperuma at the CMC meeting, a waste of taxpayer?s money for such purposes is a crime as every right-thinking person would agree. This was her second act after taking over the reins, the first being a 1.5 million lunch at the inaugural meeting. However, as reported in Daily Mirror, Rosy enlightened the rate payers on the truth behind such wild allegations. She said,? ?
?There is no move to spend Rs.5.7 million to renovate the toilets at the Mayor?s official residence but some Rs.5.2 million is to be spent on preserving the entire bungalow as a place of archaeologically value, Colombo? she continued, ?I have sought the advice of an expert from the Department of Archaeology on renovating the official bungalow and preserving it as a place of archaeological value. It was this expert who advised me on purchasing fittings and other material for the renovation. The method followed earlier was a fully fledged contract which included providing material and labour but this time the CMC will purchase the material and deploy its own workers to carry out the work,? the Mayoress told a media briefing, as the paper carried the news.?Undoubtedly, her idea is very genuine and praiseworthy.? ?
?
The Rs. 640,000/- Chair
Then came the news that shocked the nation. Western Provincial Councillor Mahinda Jayasinghe revealed the price of a chair andcommented on the purchase approved by the House for 104 members of the Council, which convenes just twice a month. The 125 chairs each costing the WPC Rs. 650,000/! And have already been ordered. He stated that they are planning to buy these chairs for the newly-opened Provincial Council building. He emphasized the fact that though there are only 104 members, someone is planning to import 125 chairs. More appalling was the cold-hearted contempt; when inquired by a scribe at a media briefing, Chief Minister Isuaru Devapriya confidently responded rejecting the claim of 650,000/ per chair; in fact he quickly denied JVP?s Nipuna Arachchi?s claim, price per chair as Rs 650,000, with an emphatic NO! Instead, he said, it was [only] Rs 640,000/-! The diminutive CM continued, that all the logistical procedures, including tenders have been followed in the process, therefore no one can talk about the matter, and also there is plenty money left inside ?safe?.? ?
?
The CM is planning to spend Rs. 80 million for the councilors to sit twice a month for a couple of hours placing their two round fleshy parts of the body that form the buttock on a Rs 640,000/ worth chair! Only consolation for the tax payer is that the chair they sit on is worth more than the person [their representative] they voted in. However, Western Province Governor Hemakumara Nanayakkara had temporarily halted the purchase and aspiring to hold an investigation too. As reported in print media, addressing the electoral organization meeting of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) in Chilaw, the CM reiterated that the decision to import these chairs at such a cost as rational and it was not his alone. ?Ours is a Provincial Council that is housed in a modern 15-storey building. It has modern facilities. If you ascend to the top floor of the building, you will be able to see just how affluent our province is,? he pompously claimed.? ?
?
Both these politicians who are close allies of the President and the Prime Minister have made somewhat surprising and similar explanations saying ?we are spending our money, our coffers are overflowing with funds?
?
In the past K. C. Logeswaran, former Governor Western Province had allegedly endorsed allocations for payments made in violation of the Constitution. It is learnt that the JVP members are planning to take special privileges matter up with Independent Audit Service Commission and Attorney General for withholding such payments to the Chief Government Whips, Leaders of the House, the Opposition Leaders in Provincial Councils. They have pointed out that neither the Provincial Councils Act of 1987, nor the Constitution had provisions for such grants in such positions for the council to pay for them. If that is so, the allocation of funds on vehicles, office space and staff to the members occupying the above positions in the Provincial Councils becomes illegal. Will the JVP move the Supreme Court, it appears that they have a point on their side. If the SC upholds, what would happen to the establishments entrusted with the task of making such payments over the three decades?
Coming back to CMC, explaining matters Mayoress Rosy Senanayake said ?I have my own private residence with seven bedrooms and eight toilets thanks to my husband. What we want to do is to make sure that the place where the City?s first citizen meets foreign dignitaries is suitable for such meetings.?? Rosy has proposed an enhanced compensation package for her hundred council members; Rs 45,000/ instead of the present 20,000/- fixed some years ago. This is a welcome move, but she must not keep on adding to it like in the case of Government MPs in the Parliament. In local government, good financial management is of immense help to transform their areas into improved localities for the rate-payer to live in and work, and prevent them from becoming good hunting grounds for the councillors nefarious activities. It is the councillor who knows what municipal services the people in their wards would prefer to have in their locality.? ?
?
When public conveniences within the city were in such a unhygienic condition, a waste of taxpayer?s money for such purposes is a crime as every right-thinking person would agree
?
?One of the councillor?s duties is the authorization and monitoring of the budgetary allocations in disbursing funds to execute the proposed projects. The people should be involved in choosing the priorities for the area they live in. Councillors and citizen?s committees should meet regularly about plans and projects that affect them. Local government authorities are responsible for organising and managing large amounts of funds and offering services that influence the citizen?s daily needs. Managing capital budgets with planned payouts on, especially, the long-term investments such as buildings, vehicles, furniture and equipment that remain municipal assets for many years to come will need expert knowledge and skills is usually beyond the depths of elected councilors, but need the Commissioner?s intervention. If all the ruling party councilors plus fair-minded opposition members co-operate Rosy would certainly do an excellent job.? ?
The CM has to take a cue from the Mayor, but there is hardly any time left for him, unless his Minister makes some manipulation or trickery to achieve a desired end and delay the Provincial Council polls like he did with the local government.? ?

Chief Magistrate recalls notices on Gota, 6 others
	
The notices issued on former Defence Secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa and six others to appear in Court on September 7 were recalled by Colombo Chief Magistrate Ranga Dissanayake today.
The seven suspects were noticed by the Colombo Additional Magistrate on July 20 over the case of alleged misappropriation of state funds when constructing the D. A. Rajapaksa memorial and museum at Weeraketiya.
Rescinding the notice, the Chief Magistrate said the issuing of notices was a grave error and a violation of the Court of Appeal?s order which had been given in this regard.
Accordingly, Magistrate Dissanayake said Mr. Rajapaksa need not appear in court on September 7 and ordered the FCID to hand over the recalled notices to the suspects. (Shehan Chamika Silva)

COCA-COLA ?GIVES BACK LIFE? TO PET BOTTLES
	
Images of PET bottles being disposed in PET plastic collection bins captured at the South Africa- Sri Lanka cricket series
Coca-Cola Beverages Sri Lanka Ltd. (CCBSL) launched its ?Give Back Life? partnership with Sri Lanka Cricket during the South Africa- Sri Lanka cricket series held from 12th July to 14th August 2018 across Galle, Colombo, Dambulla, and Kandy. Committed to making strides in achieving high volumes of PET collection and recycling in Sri Lanka, the Company launched its custom PET plastic collection bins at the respective venues during the series. The ?Give Back Life? campaign educates every person to ?recycle your PET bottle to give it new life? thereby maximising the use of PET plastic bottles as a recyclable material. Coca-Cola staff on the ground at each of the stadiums wore ?Give Back Life? t-shirts overseeing the collection and spreading the message to all the gathered spectators to make sure they responsibly dispose and recycle their PET plastic bottles. This is yet another initiative by Coca-Cola to ensure any PET plastic bottle is recovered and recycled, supporting waste management schemes and preventing it unnecessarily journeying to landfills.?
Jerome Jayaratne - Chief Operating Officer, Sri Lanka Cricket noted, ?The Sri Lanka-South Africa tournament was a keenly contested one and attracted large crowds to the stadiums. We are pleased to have Coca-Cola support and encourage the sport of cricket in Sri Lanka. Furthermore, Sri Lanka Cricket is pleased to be associated with CCBSL?s ?Give Back to Life? PET recycling campaign, which was launched during the cricket tournament. We believe this campaign is getting the attention it deserves and it was heartening to see the cricket fans at the Pallekelle stadium choosing to stay back and clean-up, disposing of their waste in a responsible manner. This is a great message for all cricket fans and we hope more take up the cause.?
Commenting on engaging with Sri Lanka Cricket on this far-reaching campaign of PET collection and recycling, Mayank Arora - Managing Director, CCBSL, said, ?Partnerships like this with Sri Lanka Cricket, showcase the many opportunities to be maximised in? providing local solutions to waste management and recycling.? CCBSL is committed to PET collection and recycling. We aim with this initiative to create awareness, that if disposed responsibly, PET plastic is valuable and can be recycled benefitting people?s livelihoods. We strive towards an effective, impactful, waste management solution for PET plastic.?
CCBSL will continue to build on its partnerships, leveraging them to provide the best PET recovery solutions in line with its unique circumstances and requirement; whether it be during the Kataragama Festival or a cricket tournament like the recently concluded Sri Lanka-South Africa series. CCBSL continues to work with many such partners, including Local Government Authorities, industries, businesses, NGOs and civil society groups, to build more effective collection and recycling systems. The ?Give Back Life? campaign for PET collection and recycling also drives community mobilisation through its multi-stakeholder, volunteer clean-ups and collection programmes. CCBSL will work with a host of partners in the coming years to deliver Coca-Cola?s ?World Without Waste? packaging vision, which includes collecting and recycling a bottle for every 1 it sells by 2030.?

Colombo?s first ever ?plogging? race a success
     	 
  At the Daily Mirror, we believe that climate change is one of the greatest threats that we, as Sri Lankans, will face in the future.  Therefore, we intend to provide our readers with local and international content with the objective to educate and inspire. We would also like to learn from our valued readers about any ongoing initiatives in making Sri Lanka a more sustainable nation.   
 We aim to explore sustainable ways of living that have the most positive impact on not just our natural environment, but also for humans and animals.  
While topics such as global warming, pollution, and inequality are confronting, we believe it's time the media stopped shying away from these issues and became an active participant in finding solutions - and we hope you will join us.

Plogging, defined by Wikipedia as ?the combination of jogging and picking up litter?, is a concept created in Sweden but has since spread to other countries as a way to get a work out and help the environment at the same time. By bending, squatting and stretching to collect rubbish as you run, the body experiences a wide range of movement and can be enjoyed by people of all ages and fitness levels.? Savera Weerasinghe of local company Anantara Sustainables has brought the initiative to Sri Lanka for the first time but with a competitive element.? Held in partnership with Fox FM, the event was held on the 4th of August and included teams of 3-5 people racing around Dehiwela for 3 hours.?
The aim was to pick up the most trash in four categories ? plastic, metal, glass and landfill.? The plogging race was a major success with the 11 teams competing collecting a whopping 1350 kg worth of trash between them!? To break it down that?s:
159kg of plastic,?
768kg of glass,
138kg of metal and
284kg of landfill.
The victorious teams were given vouchers donated by local businesses, but you could say the real winner of this event was the environment.? Due to the enthusiasm of the participants, Ms Weerasinghe has advised that that participants are interested in having a plogging event once a month.? If this sounds like something you would like to get involved in, please follow Ananta Sustainables on Facebook or Instagram for more information.
Winner?s Results:
PLASTIC: Harpos Pizza ? 46kg
GLASS: MAS Kreeda ? 286.5kg
METAL: MAS Kreeda ? 108kg
LANDFILL: Stax ? 74kg

COPE stops service extension of Peoples' Bank GM
	
The Peoples' Bank (PB) General Manager is under fire for asking for an extension of service, drawing an 'exorbitant salary' and drawing salary arrears to the tune of Rs.70 million and the Ministries of Finance and National Enterprise Development had agreed to carry out the recommendation made by the Committee on Public Enterprises (COPE) to stop the service extension, Parliament was informed today.
COPE Chairman MP Sunil Handunnetti informed the House today that both the Ministry of Finance and Ministry of National Enterprise Development had agreed with the recommendation made by COPE to stop the 'illegal' extension of service.
Mr. Handunetti said the General Manager had asked for an extension, despite reaching the retiring age of 60 and had drawn a monthly salary of Rs 2.1 million while collecting a sum of Rs.70 million as arrears.
National Enterprise Development Minister Lakshman Kiriella said the government agrees with the recommendation made by COPE.
State Minister Dr. Harsha De Silva said high salaries are given to officials of state enterprises which compete with the private sector so that competent people could be attracted to the posts.
? We have to pay proper salaries so that able people are not drawn towards the private sector,? he said.
JO MP Dr. Bandula Gunawardene said some state enterprises run at a loss as a result of paying exorbitant salaries to its officials.
He stated Srilankan Airlines was a good example for this situation, where the airline had not received any benefit by appointing Suren Ratwatte as its chairman. (Yohan Perera and Ajith Siriwardana)

Decision to reactivate capital punishment shortly: Prez
	
President Maithripala Sirisena reiterated yesterday that the decision to reactivate capital punishment on persons convicted for drug offences, who continue to repeat the crime even while on death row, would be carried out without hesitation shortly.
Addressing a ceremony held to mark the modernization of the Myliddy Fisheries Harbour and its commissioning last morning (22) at a cost of Rs. 44 million, President Sirisena said he had received the list of those on death row and the top five were Pakistani nationals. He also said that he has initiated talks with Pakistan's new government on transferring Pakistani prisoners on death row to that country in order to implement the death sentence there. The President stated that the majority of prisoners on death row were women
88% of lands that had been occupied by the armed forces had already been returned to their owners in the North and added that the rest would be returned to the rightful owners of those lands before long. The lands that belonged to the Myliddy School and other schools in the area would be released back to these schools by next week.
?We all must be determined and resolve not to allow another war to occur as the separatist war that lasted for 30 years devastated the country, destroyed the economy, deprived people of living a decent life where education and health were also affected. In the post-war scenario, this government has restored the dignity and self-respect of the country and worked to rebuild confidence among communities and promote reconciliation among different ethnic groups, he said.
President Sirisena emphasized that the government?s target was to give the benefit of peace to the people in the North-East and the unity government had already done much to achieve this goal.
He also reiterated that the government was committed to saving the next generation in the North from the alcohol and drug menace and would do whatever it takes to achieve its goal.
Ministers Wijith Vijayamuni Soysa, Northern Province Governor Reginald Cooray, State Minister Dilip Wedaarachchi, Deputy Ministers Angajan Ramanathan, Cader Mastan, MPs Mavai Senadhiraja and former State Minister Vijayakala Maheshwaran were present at the ceremony. (Sandun A Jayasekera)

Do visitors have basic facilities?
	
Sri Lanka is selling itself as the number one destination for tourists from around the world, with its multi-faceted attractions. The eternal summer weather, the warm, blue seas and the golden beaches, wild-life, marine life, nature, culture, climate and history are the main reasons tourists visit the island.? ?
Some of Sri Lanka?s most popular tourist attractions such as the Sigiriya Rock Fortress and the Galle Fort are also considered as World Heritage Sites by UNESCO. They are some of the main places that tourists visit on a large scale and are promoted around the world by travel and tour agencies locally and internationally.? ?
Yet, has anyone ever considered the difficulties faced by tourists while visiting these sites?
?
Once visitors realise that these facilities are not available, but they are charged quite a high price for the ticket, they will surely not come again or recommend the place to others, once they return to their country?
?
As in many other places around the country, are there basic facilities such as clean toilets, drinking water etc? These should be provided not only for tourists but for local visitors as well. Once visitors realise that these facilities are not available, but they are charged quite a high price for the ticket, they will surely not come again or recommend the place to others, once they return to their country. For their next tour,? they would perhaps consider Thailand or Malaysia, instead.? ?
If we wish to sustain ourselves as the prime destination for tourists, then we have to consider the long term aspect and maintain these much visited places, provide decent basic needs and try to lure back the tourists who are now heading more towards Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia.??

Global food supply engineered to end life, not nourish it
	
The Health Ranger and Natural News.com Editor Mike Adams says, after having analyzed more than 1,000 foods, super foods, vitamins, junk foods and popular beverages for heavy metals and other substances at the Natural News Forensic Food Labs, he has arrived at a conclusion so alarming and urgent that it could only be stated bluntly.??
He says that based on what he has found via atomic spectroscopy analysis of all the dietary substances, people are consuming on a daily basis, that the battle for humanity is nearly lost. The food supply appears to be intentionally designed to end human life rather than nourish it. This applies to almost all countries including Sri Lanka.? ?
According to him, life-destroying toxins are intentionally engineered into the food supply. His lab has uncovered scientific proof that substances are intentionally formulated into dietary products to drive consumers insane while causing widespread infertility, organ damage and a loss of any ability to engage in rational, conscious thinking. These toxic substances are being found across the entire food supply including in conventional foods, organic foods, ?natural? products and dietary supplements.??
The Natural News Editor says this goes far beyond the mere contamination of foods with heavy metals -- a subject which is grave by itself. Rather, this is about the intentional formulation of toxic substances into products consumed by the people on a regular basis.??
The result is what we see unfolding around us now; mass insanity, incredible escalation of criminality among political operatives, clinical insanity among an increasing number of mainstream media writers and reporters, widespread infertility in young couples, skyrocketing rates of kidney failure and dialysis patients, plus a near total loss of rational thinking among the voting people. Is this not the reality in Sri Lanka also???
The effects are devastating to human civilization -- the collapse of a capable workforce, the rise of the people dependent on government for survival, the collapse of free democracies due to the cognitive retardation of the voting people, an exploding prison population and the rise of for-profit corporate prison systems and even the near complete collapse of any ability of the news-consuming public to parse and comprehend even the most basic information such as national debt figures.??
Mr. Adams says the long-term effects of this widespread food poisoning phenomenon will be the? downfall of modern human civilization for numerous reasons ranging from economic non-sustainability to environmental destruction and the global rise of political violence as we are seeing now.??
As more and more lab results have been documented at the Natural News Forensic Food Lab, it has become increasingly apparent to him that humanity cannot survive the mass engineered poisoning of the food supply.??
?You are, of course, being expertly distracted from all this with tabloid celebrity news, staged political drama and of course the all-time favourite distraction of every crumbling empire -- violent sports,? he says.??
He says what he has published so far just barely scratches the surface of what we are finding. Here?s an overview of some of the incredibly shocking findings he has now documented:??
The now-infamous ?yoga mat chemical? used by Subway in their breads is also widely used across the fast-food industry.?
	There is no logical reason why chemicals like azodicarbonamide need to be added to recipes of fast food breads and buns. The chemical serves no necessary functional or nutritive purpose. It seems to exists solely for the purpose of delivering the chemical to hundreds of millions of consumers by blending it into popular fast foods.??
	A popular dietary herb designed to improve brain performance actually contains high levels of lead in most products tested. These were sourced from China. Lead is a toxic heavy metal that damages brain function. Mr. Adams says it was shocking to him to discover that ?brain herbs? contain so much lead that they contribute to brain damage.?
According to parliamentarian and Presidential advisor, Ven. Athuraliye Rathana Thera, Manning Market vendors have decided to reject vegetables or fruits for which the controversial glyphosate weeedicide was used. The government earlier banned the usage of glyphosate. Apparently under pressure from powerful transnational companies, the ban was recently relaxed. Therefore we believe that the consumers and the people comprised the most powerful force if we decide to act as responsible citizens and refuse to buy food items for which potentially toxic chemicals have been used.? ?

?I didn?t crave for perks as  Presidential  advisor? - Athuraliye Rathana Thera
	
It was a sudden decision taken by MP Athuraliye Rathana Thera, who served in the capacity of senior advisor to the President, to resign from this post. The following interview with the monk is aimed at finding out what his next move in politics would be.? ?

Any proposal that comes before the Cabinet would go before this Policy and Planning Committee

	The Joint Opposition is only keen on staging protests
<U+200B>
Excerpts:? ?
?
?Q??What made you suddenly decide to resign from the post of senior advisor to the President?? ?
When you mention about senior advisor to the President, it is imperative that all the wrong doings of the Government fall on my shoulder as well. I too became a respondent. I wanted to release myself from being in such situations. These situations aren?t obstacles in my way if I wish to continue working with the President. If he calls me I am ready to offer my advise to him at any moment.? ?
?
?
?Q??What are the wrong doings of the Government?? ?
The bond issue surfaced during the first quarter. The relationship with Arjun Aloysius, the behaviour of Arjuna Mahendran and the economic loss caused to the country and state institutions that were connected with the alleged Bond incident are considered as a large scale robbery by the people. There has been no period like this in our country where our political nudity was exposed to such an extent. The United National Party (UNP) didn?t follow the concept of National Government. Decisions were held among a small group.? ?
?
?Q??You once stated that despite you holding a position, no advice was sought from you. Does it mean that this position was useless?? ?
If you look at what has taken place during the recent past it proves that our advice was not required.? ?
?
?Q??Though your advice was not asked for the facilities the post brought you were quite adequate.Your comments.? ?
When acceptance this senior advisor?s post I was given a vehicle which was 20 years old. I have not used the Petrol allowance, cash nor any other thing. I visited Polonnaruwa and Trincomalee more than 40 times to popularise ?Farming without the use of dangerous chemicals? and spent my own money. People wont do this today. As a result I didn?t save a cent.? ?
?
?Q??One cannot be absolved by blaming only the UNP when a national Government is in office.Your comments.? ?
The President should also take some responsibility in having the Economic Management under the UNP. I say this because we gave power to the President and he is the one who presented the country with a plan for development.? ?
?
?Q??Have you intervened in matters so as to direct the Government on the correct path.? ?
We sent our request in writing to the President to formulate a committee on economic policies and planning. The President made a promise to the people and we requested that it be implemented. Any proposal that comes before the Cabinet would go before this Policy and Planning Committee. Then the proposal would be monitored and amendments, if any, would be made before it comes back to the Cabinet. The agreement with Singapore had been signed without any scrutiny. This proposal was presented to both the President and the Prime Minister, but they did not consider it and now they say that committees were appointed from both sides.? ?
?
?Q??Now the Singapore Agreement has been signed. Why didn?t you tell this beforehand?? ?
I made my protest verbally regarding the Singapore Agreement. I had discussions with Minister Malik Samarawickrama and the Prime Minister separately and pointed out the harm that could be caused by this agreement. Though it is mentioned that this is a Yahapalana Government the signing of this agreement has been done violating Democratic principles. The situation the country is in as a result is even worse than during the J.R. Jayewardene regime. Despite this agreement being signed in the presence of the President, he seems to be unaware of it. At present the President can be compared to a decoration that?s carried during a festival. When this agreement was proposed the President should have consulted the advisory committee or me, as the senior advisor. Why I say this is because I made many sacrifices to bring him to power. Some say that this is the work of the Prime Minister. I have my doubts over that because I am made to understand that this was the work of Malik Samarawickrama. This agreement had been presented to the Cabinet in English. There are, many in the Cabinet who do not know English. Even if one knows English it is difficult to comprehend the Technology in it. This is not a colony of the British Empire. This agreement would not only harm the local industrialists and professionals it would also seriously affect the country?s independence as well. Without having a national policy with regard to trade signing of this type of agreement is futile. Environmental regulations are not covered by this agreement and it is an illegal and anti-social agreement.? ?
?
?
The Govt. is now thinking that through ?Gamperaliya? it can win the people over. I am of the opinion that the President, as the Leader of the State, should state clearly to the?country the path he wishes to take
?
?
?Q??Those who drafted this agreement says that it can be amended.? ?
I earnestly request from the President as an individual, who sacrificed much to his victory, to discuss this issue with the professionals. I have already made this request in writing and have handed over to him all the documents connected with it.? ?
?
?Q??Do you still believe that there is room to guide the Government on to the correct path?? ?
What I say is to correct the wrongs and win back the honour of the people. To remain silent in the face of wrongdoings is not the answer.? ?
?
?Q??Do you think that the Government has enough time to correct itself through reconstruction?? ?
The Government is now thinking that through ?Gamperaliya? it can win the people over. I am of the opinion that the President, as the Leader of the State, should state clearly to the country the path he wishes to take. It appears that he has no stability. He is not sure whether a constitution requiring a referendum would be brought in. This is the same position with regard to the economic policies. Before everything else he should commit himself to carry out the policies he put forward to the people to stabilise the country.? ?
?
?Q??At a time when Rathana Thera is becoming independent the President is embracing the party. The split between the Political camps that were behind the 2015 change has also contributed to the ruination of the Government.Your comments.? ?
It is good for the President to be in a party which may have been affected in a different way.? ?
?
?Q??The friendly political groups that existed long ago are now becoming inactive.Your comments.? ?
With the robbing of a state bank at the outset, these groups were in disarray. When the Budget that was presented did not relate to the path the country should take, people lost their confidence. Even the constitution would face the same situation.? ?
?
?Q??In the absence of being affiliated to a party, does the political character known as Athuraliye Rathana still have bargaining power?? ?
It is true that I was a member of a party, but I was always with the people?s movements. I believe that the people have faith in my conscience. That is why they invited me to address the cooperative movement which has the representation of hundreds of thousand individuals. How can you gather so much people without giving them a packet of rice or paying for their transport? It is my duty to represent this one million odd people and see to the national wants of the country. You can see whether I have bargaining power in the near future.? ?
?
?
?Q??after attacking the Government and then walking out, with whom are you now trying to form a group?? ?
I?m not going to join anyone. My standings are on principles. There are about one million who examine the pros and cons before voting. There are another five hundred thousand who spend days in meditation, listening to Bana and who spend more time in and around temples. They opine that the country cannot go on like this. But they aren?t taking a unified decision and are not moving on a definite path. Our aim is to gather this one million and form a National Council. We are aiming at constituting this National Council numbering about 500. Those in the council will be representing the Buddhist monks, scholars, engineers, professionals, journalists, artistes and others who are versatile in other fields. There are about 200 of them with us now. We are having discussions these days with the representatives of all these sectors. We should create a situation so that even the Cabinet cannot by pass this council.? ?
?
?Q??There had been similar overtures made by the JVP, Gotabhaya Rajapaksa and the Joint opposition to rope in the people. Isn?t this an indication that the intelligentsia whom you refer to is coming under one umbrella?? ?
There is no issue in mustering them because people are aware what is right and what the broadest alliance is about. I have no personal issues with anyone. It could be the JVP or Front line, which can unite these forces. I do not want to be its leader, but will be its coordinator. Everyone should be taken in and if we have a common aim there is no point having a division. There are honest persons both in the UNP and the SLFP. But they are being held back. We must take them out. In the JO too there are a few important people. You will find some who believe in tribalism all over the country. They are attempting to appoint a tribal leader and maintain that he should be elected to power. Let us redeem ourselves from that thinking and embrace ?Samma Ditty? (right understanding). The Joint Opposition is only keen on staging protests. They have no vision. They have no clear idea about the Singapore Agreement or how the country could be developed.? ?
?
?Q??Though you say that the JO has no vision, people voted for the Pohottuwa (The Bud) in large numbers and gave them a victory they never expected.Your comments.? ?
A- When people want to protest they will vote in such a manner, but I do not think they will vote in that manner come the Presidential elections.? ?
?
?Q??Environmentalists charge that during this Government more environment is being destroyed. What happened to your proposal for sustainable development?? ?
At a time when the powerful and the not so powerful countries entered into agreements at the Paris assembly-given that we are in possession of our own raw materials- and when Europe was closing coal power stations, we forged ahead in preparing a power generation plan to construct five coal power plants with an output of 133 Kilowatts by 2025. There is no power generation plan as to how they are going to meet the power requirements for the next seven years. Despite the completion is earmarked for 2025 they would never be able to complete it. With the construction of the wasteful Norocholai, more than 500,000 Coal particles remain as leftovers annually. Coconut trees are dying and people are infected with respiratory sicknesses. What has the Government done in this regard? We have no future with a Government that is unable to take a Cabinet decision regarding the coal power plants issue. This is the most idiotic and corrupt decision ever taken by this Government. President Sirisena won the elections by stating that instead of coal power he would turn towards Renewable Energy solutions. The Environmentalists, thinking that a person who loves the Environment should be elected to power, cast their votes with much eagerness. The President who assumed power on these pledges is now giving leadership to the preparation of plans to establish coal power plants. The past three years are recorded as the period when Renewable Energy was barely used.? ?
?
?Q??The Engineers serving the Electricity Board too present various statistics to prove that coal power usage is more economical. In that aspect how can people assume which is correct?? ?
There is no debate anywhere in the world about closing of coal power plants. Engineers cannot argue against this. Political leaders are appointed by the people. Policies are framed by the Parliament and not by officials. There is a division among the Electrical Engineers. Some are for and some others against it. Engineers claim that they would bring the world?s best coal to Sri Lanka. There is no harmless coal anywhere in the world. The JO has no idea about this. They are only hell-bent on finding fault. They cannot build up public opinion. I did not see that even Gotabhaya?s Viyath Maga discussing this issue.? ?
?
?Q??You insisted on the ban of Glyphosate. Although the Government implemented the ban first, it was removed later. Is it true that you moved on to Sustainable development as there was no alternative?? ?
Mr. Ranil Wickremesinghe doesn?t fancy the use of poisonous chemicals in cultivation. His vision has everything to do with the New Liberal Economic system. The President has no idea about the New Liberal System and he has no stability on anything. As a person who hailed from a farming colony I believed that I could convince him. There are many alternatives, and I too presented several of them. Now Glyphosate is sprayed in the Central Hills one again. The water that flows from there end up at the Kelani River and those who drink its water, drinks the water contaminated with Glyphosate. This herbicide and crop desiccantthen enters their bodies. I am ready to debate with anyone on this matter. As we have not followed the Modernised latest development strategies followed in Tokyo and Beijing, it is much easier for countries like ours to proceed towards sustainable development. We could save 100 billion that is being spent on fuel and fertilizer. What about the 21 billion spent on the importation of Lentils,15 billion on Onions, 53 billion on Sugar, 2 billion on rice, 314 million on Wheat Flour, 39 billion on milk products, 39 billion on fish, and 5 billion on oils and fats? Consider the colossal amount of money that is going out of the country as a result. When we have the sea right round the island who is the mad person who sets about importing salt. We are a nation that cannot produce our own requirement of salt, and milk. Most of the countries that produce milk do not have grass lands that have grass throughout the year. But we are supposed to be a greener country. Does New Zealand sell milk to Pakistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, or India? They sell milk only to us. None of the above countries have grasslands like our country.? ?
?
?Q??Though you attempted to put into action several policies, you continued as a MP. If they declined to take your advice you should have accepted a Ministerial Portfolio and begun implementing these policies. Your comments.? ?
I agree with you. I think in the future, whether I become the Minister of Agriculture or not it should be handled by a person with brains and a vision. Power and agriculture should be in the hands of two Ministers who love the country. A decision was taken to give money instead of fertilizer; it was later changed to give fertilizer once again. Then I raised the issue of what was going to happen to the 25,000 who implemented cultivation without the use of Poisonous inputs. The project we launched spending money would go awaste. I pleaded for a Cabinet Paper on this matter. Then again they decided that if those farmers wished they could obtain cash. Minister Amaraweera should be congratulated on this move. However up to now no money has been paid nor fertilizer been provided for the Yala Season. These farmers were induced to cultivate using compost, but on completion they are not paid. I am helpless as I cannot do anything.? ?
?
?Q??Given the order in which these targets are achieved, can?t you make use of the next power change in 2020?? ?
Invariably there should be a power change. But it shouldn?t to be done by a group formed by Rathana Thera. It should be a complete effort that calls for national unity. Our experiments in the field of agriculture were a success. My intervention, despite difficulties, should have earned state honours. I haven?t received any accolades. When the Ministry of Agriculture declined to coordinate with the officials of the same Ministry and conduct it under their direction as a pilot research, I steered this project. During the first season we proved how profitable it was to cultivate without the use of poisonous chemicals. We won the trial. These types of gains should have been announced to the nation by the President. I am sad that we did not receive that praise.? ?
?
?Q??Salaries of MPs were to be increased by over 200%. Was the decision to do so an indication that those who have power wanting to serve themselves?? ?
The people in the Anuradhapura and Polonnaruwa zone have nothing to eat. Malnutrition is widespread. There is poverty in the farming zone more than we think can think of. Everyone is in debt. In the Polonnaruwa District, where the President is from, 50% of people have pawned their lands at interest rates ranging from 10 to 15 percent. Is it correct to increase the perks of the MPs at this juncture? They should think more about the people. I was against this move. All the wrong doings of the previous Government are being repeated by the present regime too. They should have stopped the Kandy- Kataragama Road and constructed the railway line instead. People arrive in Colombo from Gampaha daily in five trains. From Ruhuna people travel in two trains to Colombo. What they should have done was to develop the railway which is used by thousands to travel about and not provide facilities for the few who travel by cars. Prime Minister Dahanayake traveled daily by train to attend Parliament. The ruler should have the protection to protect the country. If they aren?t protecting the country why should they be protected? The Police, the Army and the entire countrymen are living in frustration.? ?
?
?Q??Whatever happens the general public would vote for someone and bring him to power. Have you not taken a political decision yet?? ?
I have taken two decisions. The first one is that the President is having all powers to rectify the injustices that have taken place. I have no issues with him. By resigning from the post of advisor does not mean that I have no connection with the president. Whatever opinion he asks for will be given by me. I will? join him regarding any matter that he needs my assistance. This is the same situation with the Prime Minister. I have no personal grudge with him too. It is the same position even with the Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa. Two days after his defeat I spoke to him over the telephone. I am not inclined towards having personal disagreements with anyone. I am friendly with everyone and only criticise the policies. Presently my main task is not choosing Presidents, but preventing destruction. No matter who becomes the President, I cannot just wait and observe the destruction caused by this Government. This is my standing.? ?
?
?Q??Like Mahinda Rajapaksa, Basil Rajapaksa also admits that they acted wrong. If they are prepared to form a government after promising that they would not repeat what they did earlier are you going to join them?? ?
Actually speaking I have no issues with them. Though they say they would rectify all their wrong doings, they are yet to realise what their mistakes were. Have they or those in the Pohottuwa (Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna) declared to the country what their Economic policies are? What is their standing on poison-free farming and on the use of Glyphosate? Just because Dinesh Gunawardene declares that as members of the JO they are against it, have they discussed this matter? I am yet to hear of the Viyath Maga-innitiated by Gotabhaya Rajapaksa- discussing this issue. These issues should be discussed before they gain power in the country.? ? ?

Mahendran asks CID for documents via Interpol
	
Senior Deputy Solicitor General Haripriya Jayasundara today told the court that the Central Bank's former governor Arjuna Mahendran, who is the first suspect in the magisterial inquiry into the bond scam had recently requested the CID to forward some of the documents on the investigation through Interpol.
This was revealed when Colombo Fort Magistrate Lanka Jayaratne asked the prosecution what had happened with regard to the warrant issued on the first suspect.
SDSG Jayasundara initially said the prosecution had obtained a red notice against the suspect and was working on certain arrangements on this matter.
On being asked by the magistrate for a report on that matter without delay, the prosecution said it would make the necessary submission no sooner the process was finalised.
It said the suspect had requested for copies of the warrant and evidence against him from the CID via the Singapore Interpol.
SDSG Jayasundara informed the court that the Attorney General would look into the request and decide whether it was a legitimate demand.
When questioned by the magistrate about the whereabouts of the first suspect, SDSG Jayasundara confirmed that Arjuna Mahendran was residing in Singapore.
Meanwhile, Perpetual Treasuries Limited owner Arjun Aloysius and CEO Kasun Palisena were re-remanded till August 30 on charges of aiding, abetting and conspiring with Mr. Mahendran to misappropriate Rs.688 million in public funds at the bond auction held on February 27, 2015.
They were also re-remanded till August 30 in connection with the parallel magisterial inquiry on deleting phone call data from the PTL voice recording system and fabricating evidence to the Bond Commission.
PTL's former chief dealer Nuwan Salgado and its IT executive Sachith Devathantri were earlier arrested in this connection and subsequently released on bail amid the prosecution expecting them to be named as crown witnesses in the inquiry. (Shehan Chamika Silva)

More drugs get price cut
	
The National Medicine Regulatory Authority (NMRA) would issue a Gazette Notification to reduce prices of yet another batch of 26 essential drugs next Friday (25) a spokesman of the NMRA said yesterday.
This is in addition to the reduction of prices of 48 essential drugs in November 2016 by the NMRA.
The new regulations would apply to the branded and generic versions of the listed drugs bringing the number of drugs reduced in price to 74, he added.
The Spokesman said the new price formula would be announced based on the National Drug Policy which Health Minister Dr Rajitha Senaratne enacted in 2016 after eminent medical professional Prof. Senaka Bibile introduced it in the 60s.
?All drugs that were brought under the price formula were essential drugs regularly prescribed by doctors to heart diseases, diabetes, respiratory diseases, kidney ailments, hypertension and painkillers,? he said.
The Spokesman said with the price reduction in 2016, the monthly medical bill of patients, who regularly purchase drugs, had been slashed by half.
?The low health bill has also provided an opportunity for patients to buy the full course of drugs. In many instances, they do not purchase the full prescription they cannot afford it,? he stressed.
?For instance, the price of a 5 mg tablet of Amlodipine will come down to Rs. 15.32 from the current price of Rs. 21 and 50 mg tablet Losartan will be reduced to Rs. 10.30 from Rs. 28.00.
?Prices of other drugs such as Atorvastatin has come down to Rs. 17.63 from RS. 41.00, Clopidogrel to Rs. 15.27 from Rs. 20.50, Clopidogrel to Rs. 15.27 from Rs. 20.50, Metformin 500 mg to Rs. 10,00 from Rs.11.25 and Gliclazide 80 mg to Rs. 9.28 from Rs. 19,00,? he said.
?This formula is only a model that will be used to prepare the new drug prices and the new system. Based on the above formula, an expenditure for drugs for a heart patient or a diabetic patient will come down to Rs. 79.05 from Rs. 159.50. The monthly drug bill will come down to Rs. 2371.50 from Rs. 4,785.00,? he stressed.
?All drugs imported to Sri Lanka will bring under the drug formula restricting the profit to maximum 60% and State Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Corporation (SPMC) will be modernized in two years to produce all drugs required to Sri Lanka,? he said.
?Discussions are underway with 23 investors to set up drug producing factories. A new price formula will also be introduced for all healthcare facilities provided by the private hospitals and nursing homes shortly,? he said.
The Spokesman added that once the new Quality Assurance Lab was constructed with the aid from China, the Health Ministry would be able to prohibit prescribing drugs under the trade name.
He added at least 1,000 trade names were covered under the price formula of 47 drugs. (Sandun A Jayasekera)

MR should be allowed to contest for Presidency: JO
	
The Joint Opposition (JO) today said the opportunity should be given to former President Mahinda Rajapaksa to contest in the upcoming Presidential Election if people wanted, despite the government?s attempt to block it through the 19th Amendment to the Constitution.
MP Indika Anuruddha told a news conference that if the people wished to elect Mr. Rajapaksa as the President again, the opportunity should be given, irrespective of the number of Presidential terms.
He said it was useless to hold a Presidential Election by keeping the best player aside and added that it was not necessary to obtain the opinion of the Courts with regard to this matter.
?There are many cases in Courts already. The people?s will and opinion should be considered with regard to this and the government parties can decide on it. The government is attempting to do the same with Mr. Rajapaksa which happened to the late Prime Minister Sirimavo Bandaranaike in the 1970s. The government should do away with its poor policies,? he added. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)

## Title: My Hope UK-Lanka Foundation Dedicated  to support under-privileged children in Sri Lanka

My Hope UK-Lanka Foundation Dedicated  to support under-privileged children in Sri Lanka
	
?
Every child has a dream to go to school. But for some this is merely a dream. If a child doesn?t have school uniforms, shoes, books or a school bag, he or she is discouraged from going to school. There are many such children in the rural areas of Sri Lanka who have been marginalised by poverty. As a result absenteeism is common among these schools and children are often deprived of their basic educational needs. Identifying the need to provide support for such children, the My Hope UK-Lanka Foundation was established. Having done various projects in aid of school-children and under-privileged families, Sujith Weerasinghe and his team is determined to find more such people and give them a hand in life.?
?
We do a project every three to four months. So far we have done projects in Kandy, Badulla, Warakapola and Ampara
?
We have come across children who have never worn a pair of shoes and I got my volunteers to look for these children
Speaking to Mirror For Hope Sujith Weerasinghe, the founder of My Hope UK ? Lanka Foundation said that he has been involved with charity work for the past 20 years. ?I have been doing this very silently. One of the biggest achievements through this Foundation was raising 1.5 million pounds for tsunami affected victims in the country. The Foundation is dedicated to support under-privileged children in rural areas. We have come across children who have never worn a pair of shoes and I got my volunteers to look for these children. Through our projects each child gets five to ten books, five pencils, one eraser, brand new shoes sponsored by a leading shoe manufacturer in the country. In addition to that we also buy them a school bag from a supplier.?
Sujith was one of the people who made Sri Lanka proud in 2012 when he carried the Olympic Torch in London. Hence his vision is to create a future for people who could carry this torch for Sri Lanka. Speaking further Sujith said that last year they have helped close to 872 families. ?I am based in UK and there are 20 people helping me with the projects. We do a project every three to four months. So far we have done projects in Kandy, Badulla, Warakapola and Ampara while we try to include every ethnic minority. All the money that we collect goes into the fund and the administrative staff doesn?t get paid.?
When Sujith gets to know about a place that needs help, he sends the volunteers to check if people are genuinely poor. ?After we helped them we got to hear success stories from most places. Three to four families came back to us and said that their children have been chosen to university and that some have passed their O/Ls and most importantly children are showing an interest to go to school. Since they don?t have books and other materials, children are discouraged to come to school and schools in rural areas have higher rates of absenteeism. Even one hour of study would help a child to become a better person.?
People spend exorbitant amounts of money on weddings and other occasions. If they could pool in some money for charity they will be setting examples for the rest of the people. Last month the Foundation has given away three wheelchairs and likewise they support anybody who is in need. Speaking about the challenges faced Sujith said that the biggest challenge was in trying to find people who could help me without any hidden agendas. ?I didn?t want people to think it?s a business.
Therefore I didn?t want to partner with any other organization as well. We want to do something to make a difference and nobody can discourage me in this process. We have donors from England, Pakistan, India and Sri Lanka.?
The next stage of this project is an attempt to give away reading glasses for those who cannot afford to buy a pair of glasses. ?We have collected over 1000 frames and we are currently working on how this could be done.?
?
If there?s anybody interested to join this Foundation as a volunteer or would like to contribute to their projects drop an email to sujith.weerasinghe@aol.co.uk and mention how you would like to help and they will get back to you at their earliest. Check out their projects on www.myhopeuklanka.com or on FB at My Hope UK Lanka Foundation.?

New episode of SLIM Gamata Marketing launched in Southern region
	
The Sri Lanka Institute of Marketing (SLIM) in collaboration with the University of Ruhuna and INDECOS, commenced Fish Bonanza Phase II under the CSR project, ?SLIM Gamata Marketing? at the SLIM Matara branch with over 100 enthusiastic women entrepreneurs in the Southern Province participating.The event was graced by the two Vice Presidents of SLIM, Mr. Suranjith Swaris and Mr. Roshan Fernando. Dr. Nilantha Liyanage represented the University of Ruhuna, whilst Mr. Conrad Ranawake represented INDECOS. The Project Chair Ms. Kaushala Amarasekara, other distinguished guests and the staff of SLIM were also present at the ceremony.
The project was launched by SLIM in collaboration with the Department of Food Science and Technology of the Faculty of Agriculture at the University of Ruhuna and the Institute for Development of Community Strengths (INDECOS). HNB Grameen came on board as the Financial Partner of this project.??
As the national body for marketing, the Sri Lanka Institute of Marketing has identified a requirement for its intervention to promote the marketing philosophy among SMEs, rural enterprises and new entrepreneurs. This year ?Gamata Marketing? focuses on the fishing communities in Matara through ?Fish Bonanza?. The project was initiated with the aim of educating regional fishing communities on marketing principles and its applications. The project will train selected candidates on the new technology and skills,make them aware of means by which to produce innovative products from fish, and provide them with product strategies coupled with marketing related knowledge.?
Pradeep Edward, the President ? SLIM and CEO of Lanka Hospitals Diagnostics stated, ?As the leading institute for marketing in Sri Lanka, SLIM is determined to elevate the status of marketing in the country by producing professional marketers incountry and bringing out their hidden talents. Here at SLIM we also stress upon social responsibility in our actions to uplift the economy and create a better society. SLIM has hence embarked on a CSR program branded ?Gamata Marketing?, which focuses on the society, economy and environment of the country.?
Roshan Fernando, Vice President ? SLIM, added, ??Gamata Marketing' was launched by SLIM with the aim of empowering the regional SMEs on marketing principles and the means by which to apply them effectively and efficiently to further develop their businesses. The project focuses on helping new entrepreneurs to compete in the market by delivering specific products and services to a wider market. This initiative will help to uplift their business performance and streamline their focus, attitudes and orientation towards market based products, which is the key to success in the marketing industry.?
Kaushala Amarasekara, the Project Chairperson of Gamata Marketing said, ?The latest endeavour by SLIM, ?Gamata Marketing? aims to identify and uplift unseen entrepreneurs in rural areas and emphasize the importance of marketing. Women play a vital role as entrepreneurs in this society. They have an enormous capacity to indulge in sustainable businesses. Yet women living beyond urban and sub-urban areas of the country often lack education and exposure to the latest trends in the world. Thus, they are confined to conventional methods when engaging in business and household affairs. SLIM with ?Gamata Marketing? intends toprovide these women with business ideas, opportunities and also look forward to elevating the status of their living standards.??
?Gamata Marketing? creates an opportunity to provide awareness to the rural stakeholders about the importance of marketing and its benefits to all individuals and thereby to the society. The project will bridge the gap between rural upcoming entrepreneurs and SLIM, which in turn will open a whole new world to the upcoming entrepreneurs.?
SLIM is the national body for marketing in Sri Lanka and has been promoting marketing excellence and elevating the status of marketing since 1970. Incorporated by the Parliament Act 41 of 1980 of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka.?

New prisons for Welikada female inmates: Sarathi
	
Deputy Minister of Justice and Prison Reforms, Sarathi Dushmantha said today the ministry was taking steps to transfer the Welikada Prison's female inmates to newly-constructed prisons.
He told Parliament there were shortcomings regarding basic sanitary facilities at the Welikada Prison because of congestion.
The deputy minister said this in response to a question asked by joint opposition MP Vasudeva Nanayakkara, who had pointed out that the prison lacked sanitary facilities so much so that three toilets were being used by 146 inmates.
The MP said female inmates were stressed out with these concerns, which might have led them react violently in the prison recently.(Ajith Siriwardana and Yohan Perera)

No increment of allowances, JVP says Govt. harassing AG
	
The government is attempting to harass Auditor General Gamini Wijesinghe by withdrawing the proposal to increase his salary and his allowances, the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) said today.
JVP Leader and Chief Opposition Whip Anura Kumara Dissanayake levelled this allegation when House Leader Lakshman Kiriella announced the government?s decision to withdraw the proposal.
?The Auditor General is carrying on a campaign to stop corruption and has already disclosed certain facts. We feel the AG is being subjected to political victimization. The government should have referred the matter to the party leaders meeting before taking such a decision,? he said. (Yohan Perera and Ajith Siriwardana)

Notes for a Manifesto Justice, Law and Order
	
.There are some lovely words that have been bandied about in political circles over the past couple of decades. Peace is one. There was also conflict-resolution. Reconciliation has displaced both these of late. Those who are focused on constitutional reform, in particular, those who are hell bent on devolution, like to use the word ?united? (as in, ?maximum devolution in a united Sri Lanka?). Now unity (like peace and reconciliation) cannot be legislated. The ?United Nations? for example is made of separate states (let?s forget for a moment that unity in that formidable body is largely absent). The point here is that words are easy; getting the meaning concretized and operational on the ground is tough. This is how ?justice? should be understood too.??
Justice. Another lovely word. Obtaining it requires robust systems where truth has a better than average chance; in other words, an institutional arrangement as well as a set of procedures including recruitment, training and promotion.? ?
Typically, however, those running for political office and parties/coalitions aspiring to capture political power, only talk about ensuring justice and establishing the rule of law. That?s a promise. An easy one. There?s hardly any analysis of what?s wrong with the system; the focus is on the unpalatable outcome of these flaws. It makes for sloganeering, that?s about it.? ?
It would be better if candidates delved into the nitty-gritty of it all. Then they would have to talk about the legal system, separation of powers, the judicial system, the legal profession and of course the Police. This would require a doctoral dissertation of course, but this side of a PhD, it is possible to point out glaring flaws.? ?
Today there is absolutely no discussion on the merits and demerits of adversarial and inquisitorial systems of justice, the former being what we have whereas the latter was what we had. Both target justice but whereas one does not care for social fallout, the other does. The argument for retaining the current system is essentially a product of conservatism and sloth, not to mention the fact that it is remunerative to the key stakeholders in the system. So we have come to this; this is what we have and this is what we will always have; we could only, at best, tweak things a bit. Are we that poor, though? That?s a question that needs to be addressed.? ?
Separation of legislative, judicial and executive powers is of course talked about. However, when career paths are dependent on executive fancy then independence flies out of the window. Here?s an exercise for those who are really interested in an independent judiciary:??
Check the career paths of the previous 10 Chief Justices. How many of them held the position of Attorney General? Who appointed them? What was their track record in the AG?s Department in cases where high ranking politicians were involved? What kind of determinations did they give when opinion on constitutional matters was sought? How did they perform when they held the office of Chief Justice?? ?
The truth is that the AG?s Department is now seen as a half-way house for those aspiring to serve on the Supreme Court and become the Chief Justice. What value then can we attach to the integrity of judges in the higher courts?? ?
It?s not just about career prospects. It?s about bucks too. I would challenge any judge in any court to say the following: ?There are no corrupt judges in any court in Sri Lanka!? Their salaries were considerably upped recently, in some cases the jump exceeding 250% and yet, there are inordinate delays in courts. Land cases take on an average of more than 30 years, for example. Part of the story is court vacations which were declared only to allow British judges to go home to see their families and are essentially a colonial remnant that make absolutely no sense.??
In Britain, for example, the two professions operate independent of one another, as it should be. It cannot be impossible to set up systems where law students well versed in all aspects of the law can, if they so wish and satisfy relevant criteria can either choose to represent clients or hear cases. Such systems could have inbuilt mechanisms that facilitate acquisition of knowledge and relevant experience.? ?
A quick note on legal education would be appropriate at this point. The Law College, Medical College and Technical College were established long before the formal university system was set up in this country. As time went by, the functions of technical colleges were incorporated into the university system, as was the Medical College. The Law College was spared. It is high time that the Law College was formally absorbed into the overall system of legal education in higher educational facilities.? ?
Let?s not forget the enforcers, those who are also mandated to ensure law and order -- the Police. Over the years, due to the conflict, the Police were tasked to do a lot of things outside the frame of traditional police work. Today, almost a decade after the war on terrorism ended, things haven?t changed. No wonder that crime cannot be effectively combatted.??
There are other reasons. Corruption, for one, but let?s leave that aside for now. Incompetence is a serious problem. There are massive flaws in the entire system of recruitment, training and promotions. The Police Commission seems ignorant of all this or incapable of sorting out the mess. In Britain people are recruited as constables and have to work their way up depending on performance that is regularly and systematically assessed. There?s no way that the top post goes to someone who has not done the constable?s beat.? ?
There?s training on the job and training for the job. Both are important, no doubt. Do we have a solid training regimen and systematic competence assessment? If we did, would we be in this situation? What does the Police Commission have to say?? ?
What?s also imperative is a cogent system ensuring that incompetence is found out and corrected. In Sri Lanka?s case, there are ways around all this. Political patronage always ruins systems. We have it. Stringent evaluation makes for quality control. We don?t have it.? ?
It is easy to mutter words and terms such as justice, law and order, independence of the judiciary, etc. Will our presidential hopefuls go beyond? Let?s hear it from the following and others who have presidential ambitions: Gotabaya Rajapaksa, Rohan Pallewatte, Nagananda Kodituwakku, Maithripala Sirisena, Ranil Wickremesinghe and Patali Champika Ranawaka.? ?

Sajith calls for an open economy with a human face
	
United National Party (UNP) Deputy Leader and Minister of Housing Sajith Premadasa recently called for an open economy with a human face saying it is the right way to establish a just society.
Mr. Premadasa expressed this sentiment while speaking at the Sri Lanka Institute of Marketing (SLIM) awards ceremony held in Colombo recently.
?It must be understood that full-blown capitalism is not the order of the day. A just and fair society can only be established through systems, structures and procedures that are based on benevolence capitalism. To use a more apt phrase, a just society could be established through capitalism with a human face,? Mr. Premadasa said.
?It is a universal notion that the free market capitalistic approach is the best mechanism to create wealth. However, we need to be cognizant of externalities and social costs of this system. Therefore the government and the corporate sector benevolence are of utmost importance in order to address the grievances of the society, to correct the imperfections and anomalies which are sad by-products of this system,? he added.
He then requested the corporate sector to focus more on corporate social responsibility. ?I make a humble request from everyone gathered here. Now you shall smile, you will celebrate. Today you will enjoy your success. When the function is concluded, when the curtains are drawn and when it is time to leave please think of the poor and of the destitute in the society, on those who have become permanent members of abject poverty circle. Please do think of the silent majority of our motherland. Once you do so, gather your energy to talk to your superiors and explain the importance of civic responsibility and corporate social responsibility. Remind them of late President John F. Kennedy?s words of wisdom "if a society cannot help the many who are poor, it cannot save the few who are rich", the minister said.
The minister said in this regard he was willing to work with the corporate sector to provide lands to the landless, homes to the homeless and to feed the hungry.
The UNP Deputy Leader then stressed the need for a depoliticized approach to resolve issues faced by the country today. He again quoted late President Kennedy and said "Ask not what your country can do for you but what you can do for your country" and added that these sentiments were relevant to Sri Lanka even today.
?Kennedy once said, "let us not take the Republican answer, the democratic answer but let us seek the right answer". This view stated by the former American President is also relevant to us. Therefore we should not seek the UNP answer, the SLFP answer, the flower bud answer or the JVP answer for all our issues. We all should use our energies, mobilize our resources to find the right answer for this country,? he said. (Yohan Perera)

?
Donald Trump stood accused of conspiring to commit campaign finance fraud and two of his closest aides faced jail time Tuesday, after court proceedings delivered a legal and political one-two punch to his embattled presidency.??
In a drama that played out simultaneously across two US cities, a court found one former aide guilty of eight charges -- and the other pleaded guilty to another eight -- stemming from the federal investigation into the 2016 presidential election.??
In New York, Trump?s longtime fixer, the attorney Michael Cohen, admitted to charges that included making illegal campaign contributions.??
Cohen detailed how he made pre-election hush payments to porn star Stormy Daniels and Playboy model Karen McDougal. Both claim to have had affairs with Trump.??
But in a sensational twist, Cohen also pointed to the president -- or ?individual 1? as a co-conspirator -- alleging that he acted ?in coordination and at the direction of a candidate for federal office? in making those payments.??
?I participated in this conduct with the purpose of influencing the election,? a visibly crestfallen Cohen told the judge, his voice trembling at times as he addressed the packed courtroom.??
That admission put Trump himself in legal jeopardy. And it raised the prospect that a once-trusted lieutenant is ready to spill secrets, gathered over decades, in exchange for a reduced sentence.? ? Cohen?s lawyer Lanny Davis explained;?
?
?This is Michael fulfilling his promise... to put his family and country first and tell the truth about Donald Trump.? ?Today, he stood up and testified under oath that Donald Trump directed him to commit a crime by making payments to two women for the principal purpose of influencing an election,? the lawyer continued.?

Venerable Fa Hsien Thera : Icon of Buddhism in China
	
Venerable Fa Hsien Thera is a Chinese Buddhist Monk who engaged in a quest to bring the sacred Buddhist texts from the then South Asian sites of Buddhism and translate them to propagate the Buddha Dhamma in China. His endeavour that started in 399 CE was to last more than 12 years before he could return to China. Venerable Fa Hsien Thera is regarded as a crucial historical link between China and other Asian Buddhist countries such as Sri Lanka, where in the present day the Belt and Road Initiative has evoked the significance of the ancient land and maritime Silk Roads he travelled.??
Born in 337 CE in Shanxi, Ven. Fa Hsien lived under the influence of Buddhism which enjoyed imperial favour during the Eastern Jin Dynasty and adopted his spiritual name which translates as the ?Splendour of Dhamma?. His travelogue - Foguoji (?Record of Buddhist Kingdoms?) gives vivid details of his travels from China to India, Pakistan, Nepal, Bangladesh and then to Sri Lanka which was then one of the most flourishing centres of learning Buddhism at the time. What is incredible is that his travel on land was mostly on foot, despite the dangers ever-present and obvious.?
On an account of his terrifying crossing of the wastelands of Central Asia, he writes:
In the desert were numerous evil spirits and scorching winds, causing death to anyone who would meet them. Above there were no birds, while on the ground there were no animals. One looked as far as one could in all directions for a path to cross, but there was none to choose. Only the dried bones of the dead served as indications.??

?
Upon his arrival in North Western India in 402 CE, he settled into studying the Sanskrit scripts with Buddhist scholars and engaging in conversations with learned monks. He transcribed the Vinaya of Mahasanghika School and acquired another version of Vinaya from Sarvastivada School and the famous Mahaparinirvana-Sutra.He visited the most important sites of Buddhist learning - Udyana, Gandhara, Peshawar and Taxila, and the Buddhist Holy Sites - Lumbini, the Birthplace of Prince Siddhartha, Bodh Gaya where Enlightenment was attained, Baranas, the site of the first sermon and Kushinagar where the exalted one attained supreme bliss of Parinirvana.??
On his return trip to China, Ven. Fa Hsien Thera took a different route from the one he adopted for his arrival and sailed to Sri Lanka where he added the Mahishasaka Vinaya and a selection of the Sarvastivada canon to his collection of Buddhist scripts. After 02 years in Sri Lanka, he set sail for China, where he spent the rest of his life translating and editing the scriptures, rendering a yeoman service to Buddhism in China till his passing away in around 422 CE.??

We weren't happy about Prabhakaran's death: Rahul
	
Congress President Rahul Gandhi on Wednesday said he and his sister Priyanka Gandhi Vadra were not happy after the terror group LTTE's chief Prabhakaran, who ordered the assassination of his father Rajiv Gandhi, was killed, as they felt "the violence inflicted upon him had impacted others, including his children".
The Congress chief said he has lost two members of his family to violence. "My grandmother (Indira Gandhi) and my father (Rajiv Gandhi) were both killed. So, I have suffered violence," Mr Gandhi said at the Bucerius Summer School in Hamburg, Germany.
"I am talking actually from experience. The only way you can move forward after violence is forgiveness. There is no other way. And to forgive you have to understand what exactly happened and why it happened," Rahul Gandhi said.
Former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi was killed by two of her bodyguards in 1984, and her son and former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi was assassinated by a suicide bomber of the LTTE in 1991. Sri Lankan security forces shot dead Prabhakaran and destroyed the LTTE in May 2009, ending a quarter century of separatist war in the island nation.
"To deal with it is to actually listen and act non-violently. People think this is weakness. But in fact this is strength. My father was killed by a terrorist in 1991. In 2009, I saw the person who killed my father lying in a field in Sri Lanka," Rahul Gandhi said.
"I called up my sister Priyanka and said that this is very strange, but I am not happy. I should be celebrating that the person who is dead is the person who killed my father. But somehow I am not happy. She said 'you are right, I am not happy either'," the Congress chief said. "The reason I wasn't happy was because I saw myself in his children. So, I realised, him lying there actually means that there are kids like me who are crying," he added.
"He might have been a bad or an evil person, but the violence that was done against him was impacting others, like it had impacted me. If you go deep, you will find there is something that triggered that violence. It's not just a random event. Some action or violence done against him or her has triggered it," Rahul Gandhi said.
He also said that the only way one can fight violence is by non-violence. "There is no other way. You might be under the illusion that you can fight violence with violence, but it will come back. You might think that you are very powerful and that you can subdue somebody else, but they will find a way of coming back," Mr Gandhi said.(NDTV)

What brings the  US Peace Corps to Sri Lanka?
	
?
The available information on the return of the US Peace Corps (USPC) to Sri Lanka on the stated mission of ?English language education? raises many questions, given the timing and context of their arrival. Under the terms of the agreement signed between the Minister of Foreign Affairs and the Acting Director of the Peace Corps in February, the first 25 volunteers will arrive in the country in September 2019 for their two year assignments. This is likely to coincide with the run-up to the next presidential election which, according to the constitution, has to be held by? December 9, 2019 the latest. The volunteers along with the members of their households as well as ?persons performing functions under contract? by them,are to be granted diplomatic privileges under the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, that would exempt them from taxes and customs duties, ?as provided to members of the administrative and technical staff of the Embassy of the United States,?according to a report in the Sunday Times (ST) of July 8, 2018.
?
?
USPC will be here for ?English teaching?
	?
	Peace Corps was created in the US in 1961
	?
	First batch of 25 will arrive in Sept. 2019
	?
	GoSL reported to have invited USPC in 2016
?
US President John F. Kennedy when he created the Peace Corps in 1961 stated that its goal was to allow American citizens to serve the cause of ?world development.? He said it ?is not designed as an instrument of diplomacy or propaganda or ideological conflict.? USPC volunteers were expected to work with poor communities in developing countries,enjoying no special privileges.? ?
Though there is supposed to be a strict separation between the USPC and any intelligence activity of the US government, its chequered history has shown that it has often been accused or suspected of being involved in espionage in the host country, and being asked to leave.Among countries USPC had to leave are Indonesia (1965), Guinea (1966), Sri Lanka (1971), India (1976) and Cambodia (2017). In Bolivia, in 2008, a US embassy official was charged with espionage, sent home and not allowed to return. ABC News revealed that 30 USPC volunteers, as well as a Fulbright scholar, had been asked by the official to spy on Cubans and Venezuelans living in Bolivia. The US embassy in La Paz acknowledged the incident, reports said.? ?
Richard Haas, head of the Council on Foreign Relations even suggested that the rules be relaxed so that USPC, along with American journalists and members of the clergy, could work as agents or as cover for the CIA?s intelligence gathering, the Washington Post (WP) reported in1996. The astounded USPC Director Mark Gearan responded at the time saying the suggestion was ?both dangerous and cynical.???
?
The US move to send the Peace Corps to Sri Lanka needs to be viewed in the context of the larger plans in the region it calls the ?Indo Pacific
?
?Peace Corps volunteers often serve in remote areas of their host countries without access to modern communications or special security arrangements. They are not government employees, are paid only a small subsistence allowance and are not granted any special privileges, such as diplomatic immunity. They are prohibited from involving themselves in the political affairs of their host countries,?Gearan wrote, in the WP.
The move by the government of Sri Lanka (GoSL) of granting USPC diplomatic privileges comes across as doubly odd in the light of Gearan?s description of the volunteers. According to the ST, the government has also exempted from taxes, customs duties and other charges ?all equipment, supplies, and other goods and services introduced into or acquired in Sri Lanka by the US Government or any contractor financed by it,? under the agreement. It would be interesting to know what costly?equipment? is being brought into the country by the USPC for the purpose of ?English teaching,? that requires suchtax concessions.The inclusion of ?contractors? too under this exemption is of concern, seeing that private contractors hired to carry out projects forthe US government have on occasion been accused of being CIA fronts. It?s no consolation either, to know that the current US Secretary of State took up his post following directly from his job as CIA director in the Trump administration.??
To come back to the question of English teaching (assuming that the USPC mission is bona fide): while there is no doubt that the school system throughout the country can benefit from more and better English teachers, one needs to ask whether Sri Lanka?s own English teaching community with their decades of experience wouldn?t be better able to handle the challenges involved in teaching English in a post-colonial context, given also the fast-changing present day social environment, than a few dozen foreign volunteers flown in for a couple of years.
The US embassy says the Sri Lanka English Teachers Association (SLETA) will ?work closely? with the volunteers. But who sets the priorities and who makes the decisions? Wouldn?t the SLETA and Sri Lanka?s own educationists be better positioned to improve the English teaching programme themselves, in a way that complements their ongoing work, if the funding and resources were turned over to them? Its hard to avoid the conclusion that, on the balance, the party benefiting more from this exercise will be not the Sri Lankans but the American volunteers, who will gain useful exposure to a different culture, language and value system through grass-roots interactions with local communities.??
It?s interesting to note that in India - in the context of efforts to revive the USPC programme that was phased out in 1976 - John Chromy, Special Assistant to the Director of Peace Corps (1976) observed that ?India in the past decade has moved rapidly into a modern economy and sees itself not as a recipient of aid assistance but in fact a donor of assistance to other countries much poorer then India.? Sri Lanka?s situation may not comparable to that of a regional power like India, but as a middle income country its worth considering whether this is the kind of ?aid? that it needs.??
?
30 USPC volunteers, and? a Fulbright scholar, were asked by the official to spy on Cubans and Venezuelans living in Bolivia
?
Acting Director of USPC Sheila Crowley expressed gratitude ?to the Government and people of Sri Lanka for their invitation? to the USPC to return. However it is news to ?the people of Sri Lanka? that they had extended such an invitation. The GoSL is reported to have invited the USPC back in 2016, but it is only now that this is being made known.??
The US move to send the Peace Corps to Sri Lanka needs to be viewed in the context of the larger plans in the region it calls the ?Indo Pacific.?The $39 million in ?military financing? to Sri Lanka announced last week would be part of the $300 million reportedly pledged by US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo earlier in Singapore, on the sidelines of an ASEAN foreign ministers? meeting,?to reinforce security cooperation? throughout the region (meaning, to push back against China).??
In Sri Lanka though the US cut back its development assistance, it has been investing large sums in programmes of its own design at every level. Military ties are being pursued with frequent ship visits and joint military exercises. Not only the military, but the legislative and executive branches of government, as well as the legal system and local government, have by now been virtually ?mapped? in terms of their infrastructure, human resources, capacities etc.,through USAID and other programmes. The GoSL tells the public little,if anything, about these projects and it is not clear if there is any accountability to anyone on the Sri Lankan side, regarding the use of these considerable funds. Against this backdrop, its worth asking, is the USPC mission; nothing more than yet another aspect of the US penetration of Sri Lanka - this time at the grassroots, community level???

Where are all the lyricists?
	
The poet is a curious creature. He does not pander to the majority, but his role is that of a public voice. The language he resorts to thus cannot be esoteric or obscurantist, because by definition, being a poet, he cannot obfuscate. So he gets entangled in a strange conundrum: he has to speak to the people, but not in the language of the people. He has to be the voice of an entire collective and identity, yet strike some sort of a balance between the emotions of the majority and the aesthetic sensibilities of a minority. This is as true for Sinhala society as it is for other societies, here and elsewhere, so from the oldest scribe to the youngest radical, it is this challenge which distinguishes the written word from the visual arts. Moreover, what is true here of the poet and his verses is to a large extent also true of the lyricist and his songs. He may be more popular, he may have to tone down his language to appeal to a broader base, but essentially, there cannot be a world of difference between these two people.??
In ?Modernizing Composition?, Garret Field charts the evolution of the Sinhala song. It is an admirable piece of work, particularly considering that Field, who completed it via a Fulbright-Hays scholarship and two years of extensive research in the country (packed with conversations with various veterans in the field), took the trouble of studying and to an extent mastering Sinhala before embarking on his enterprise. The book deserves more than a sketchy review, and not being a student of music, much less of literature, I am unable to pen down more than a few thoughts. Reviewing it in whatever way, however, is not my intention here. My intention is to ascertain how poetry and literature coincided in the context of the Sinhala song and how this may explain an insidious conclusion I?ve drawn from the many conversations I?ve had with people: that the Sinhala lyricist, as we once knew him or her, is nowhere to be found.??

The lyricist in Sri Lanka
This is not to suggest that the lyricist in Sri Lanka is dead. There are songs, a great many of them, which make the rounds every day on television, radio, and more than both these, the internet. We expect Iraj to come up with a new music video every other month, packed with the requisite level of controversy. His songs make no sense if you read into them (those of the early Iraj did), but that is because we are not meant to read them; we are supposed to be awed by the visuals (which are deep or disgusting, depending on how you view them). On the other hand there are the proponents of popular adolescent music: Sanuka, Nadeemal Perera, Lahiru Perera, and those never-ending boy bands that release covers. On average, a band transits from such covers to original pieces after three or four years, but that is an average, and most bands I know, even after five or six years, still resort to ?remakes?. More often than not, they are formed to take part in competitions organised at school level, and if they win, they publicise themselves heavily by taking part in social welfare projects (like donating proceeds of concerts to cancer projects). They are also unknown to each other, which is why they sometimes pick on the same names: I know of two ?Syrens?, for instance.??
The lyricist does not figure that prominently in this scheme of things. For one thing, covers do not require poets; they are based on works produced elsewhere. For another thing, the level of prose needed to titillate audiences is based on what the audiences have heard until then, so through ceaseless repetition, the same theme, reworked 10 times or so over, became a staple, a trend to emulate. Sarith and Surith Jayawardena, in 2016, came up with ?Ira Wenas Wela?, which was not a ?trendsetter? that forayed into that most emulated theme, unfulfilled and unrequited love. But while ?Ira Wenas Wela? was different and did contain some reckonable lyrics (not least because they were written by the father of the twins, a teacher acquainted with both language and mass communication), it was a one-sided affair; Sarith and Surith are the only teenage vocalists I?ve talked to who have emphatically stated that they will not perform a song without examining its lyrics first. This attitude is not widely shared. Why, I can?t say.??
?
?
Losing footing?
Field, in his book, makes a rather interesting observation: in Sri Lanka, which has never had a musical tradition of its own, the lyrics to a song have been regarded as a work in itself, a sample of artistic craftsmanship which should ?stand on its own as a piece of literature? (as Mahagama Sekara put it in a lecture in 1966). Except for plays, where the script has an autonomous existence that can be reworked and reinterpreted in a hundred different ways if possible, there is no other art form in which this act of ?autonomising? one element from every other is possible, and it is certainly not possible in Western societies, where except for literary geniuses like Bob Dylan and Simon and Garfunkel, the lyric cannot really stand up on its own this way. Consider a Sinhala song from the sixties, and compare its lyrics with that of a contemporary song, and you can see the difference: the lyricist has lost his footing, he is no longer able to stand on his own, he has become entangled in cheap moneymaking processes, he is a victim of the composer and vocalist, and he has become a second fiddle through this.?
?
?
The popular Sinhala song, from the nineties on, is the product mainly (though not jointly) of two lyricists: Nilar N. Cassim and the more flamboyant Wasantha Dukgannarala. I remember Upul Shantha Sannasgala interviewing Dukgannarala once and I remember him prefacing the interview with the following sketch: ??Duka? hitapu gaman sindu liyanawa, keti katha liyanawa, ragapanawa, danweem hadanawa, sarama adinawa, thekka wikunanawa, company walata yanawa, bulath wita kanawa, denim adinawa.???
?

Buttressing this is another interesting, though not unusual, phenomenon: the best young lyricists come from either the village or the fringes of the city. From the last 50 or so years only three lyricists, among the many I?ve come across, can be termed as urban versifiers: Premakeerthi de Alwis, Lucien Bulathsinghala, Saman Athaudahetti. This has nothing to do with their origins (Sunil Ariyaratne lived in Nugegoda, but I would hardly term him as an urban versifier), rather with the artistic temperament they have projected through their work. Premakeerthi was shaped by the Colombo poets (the idealisations of the female figure in his songs attest to this), Bulathsinghala?s lyrics reflect a wide ranging milieu which goes beyond the village, while Athaudahetti evokes a rural arcadia being ?visited? by the metropolis (?Iri Thalunu Wala? is still a favourite among adolescents I know who scandalously profess ignorance of other songs by Amarasiri Peiris). Most other lyricists, even those who settled in Colombo in later years on account of their education or careers, remained at heart poets of the village. ?Regardless of historical period, national development begins with the farmer,? wrote Madawala Ratnayake in his preface to Akkara Paha. That farmer came from the village; it was the village that these early lyricists returned to, frequently.??
The popular Sinhala song, from the nineties on, is the product mainly (though not jointly) of two lyricists: Nilar N. Cassim and the more flamboyant Wasantha Dukgannarala. I remember Upul Shantha Sannasgala interviewing Dukgannarala once and I remember him prefacing the interview with the following sketch: ??Duka? hitapu gaman sindu liyanawa, keti katha liyanawa, ragapanawa, danweem hadanawa, sarama adinawa, thekka wikunanawa, company walata yanawa, bulath wita kanawa, denim adinawa.? That is the best description of the man I?ve come across until now. Born in Anuradhapura, and perhaps more ruralised than the Matara and Rahula College bred Cassim, he is a paradox, the sort that attracts both mystical praise and vituperative condemnation. In 2007, someone posted the following on an online forum: ?Wasantha Dukgannaralage sampradaya grameeyada? Nagarikada?? That is a question to which no one, not even (I feel) Cassim, can provide a proper answer. He is of both worlds, yet belongs to neither. It is this curious paradox which found its way to the vocalists and the melody makers of subsequent years: rooted, but in a way also uprooted.??
Take three lyricists from the recent past: Manuranga Wijesekara (?Saragaye?), Sanuka (?Mayam Kalawe?), and the lesser heard of Ujitha Warnakulasuriya (?Rathriyak?). ?Rathriyak? is the most profound Sri Lankan love song I?ve heard in recent years; it was written for Nadeemal Perera, who is better known for ?Mayam Kalawe?. The differences in tone and temperament between these three singles couldn?t be more obvious: both ?Saragaye? (?Niyarata... Mawanawa... Apathare... Wu katha...?) and ?Mayam Kalawe? (?Mayam Kalawe... Saayam sinase... Payan sande...?) subsist on a fragmented aesthetic (the only rationale I can think of: the adolescent male, to whom both songs are addressed, are so blown away by the prospect of first love he can?t get beyond two or three words a line), ?Rathriyak? is the sort of love song which can be read and read into (?Mata maath nomathi digu rathriyak pamani? takes from, and adds to, that other memorable one-liner, ?Mata mage nowana magema adarayak thibuna?). Origins go a long way here, I suspect: both Manuranga and Sanuka, while well versed in the aesthetics of poetry, are populists hailing from the metropolis (in particular, Sanuka), while Ujitha, an Economics undergraduate at the Sabaragamuwa University, hails from Ehetuwewa. Where is Ehetuwewa? Not many would know, and not many would be able to point at it on a Sri Lankan map. A tragedy? I should think so.
