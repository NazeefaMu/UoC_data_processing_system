A stroke, heart attack or acid reflux
	

Query: Im a 24-year-old woman and have symptoms such as headaches and dizziness when I bow my head. I also feel faintish at times but this lasts for about three to four seconds. I do not actually faint but feel as if I am about to; this feeling settles down afterwards. I have also started developing occasional chest pains where I feel pain shooting up my chest. Sometimes I feel the pain on the left side and sometimes on the right. These symptoms usually last for a couple of seconds and then they go away. But since I have been getting them quite frequently, I have started to worry. I started noticing these symptoms over a week ago and have not felt them before. I wanted to know if this could be a heart attack, a stroke or gastritis or if there could be any kind of link between the symptoms
- (Madara Jayasinghe from Dehiwala). 
Answer: It is very unlikely that you are having a heart attack or a stroke. The dizziness could be vertigo, which is an imbalance in the middle ear. The chest pains are unrelated to this. You need medical attention however and it is advisable to visit your family doctor first. Chest pains can be related to many things, theres not enough information to make a definite diagnosis. Since it doesnt sound cardio-related, it could be muscular pains or even neck pain. Considering your age, it is highly unlikely to be a heart problem but it definitely warrants investigation. At your age, a stroke is not common and there should be more symptoms if this were the case. Unless you have a family history of strokes its unlikely that you would be diagnosed with one. There are many risk factors such as having a predisposition to blood pressure, smoking and high cholesterol, which are very unlikely at your age. It could be gastritis but all this could also indicate an acid reflux. When you have acid reflux, you suffer from heartburn, belching and burping. 
The reason you are experiencing these symptoms so suddenly could be due to stress from factors such as changing your job. If not, they could be related to family issues, diet and lifestyle changes that trigger these symptoms. You could also be suffering from migraines, which are common at your age. Although it may not be very serious, you should definitely see a general physician and get medical attention.

Arresting Buddhist monk not easy: DIG Jayakody
	
Police spokesman Priyantha Jayakody today admitted that the Police had failed to arrest Bodu Bala Sena (BBS) General Secretary Galagodaatte Gnanasara Thera until he surrendered to Court.
Responding to a barrage of questions from the media at the weekly Cabinet news briefing, he said a Buddhist monk could not be arrested like any other citizen.
Journalist: There were four police teams deployed to arrest Gnanasara Thera but still the police failed to arrest him.
DIG Jayakody: Yes. Our attempts to arrest him were not successful.
Journalist: Was there pressure from any quarters not to arrest him
DIG: Arresting a Buddhist monk in a temple is not an easy task.
Journalist: People ask why arrest only Gnanasara Thera when many other Tamil and Muslim extremists have made comments causing religious tension.
DIG: No We have received 21 complaints from several people making allegations against not only Gnanasara Thera but against Tamil politicians like Sivajilingam, Minister Rauff Hakeem and some doctors.
Journalist: Has action been taken against them
DIG: We are awaiting the Attorney General's advice. Under the Criminal Procedure Code there are two categories of offences over which suspects can be arrested -- one is hate speech that might cause racial or religious hatred among communities and the other is racially or religiously motivated attacks.
Journalist: Under what law was Gnanasara Thera arrested
DIG: On allegations involving remarks reportedly made to create racial tension.
Journalist: Have you arrested any one on allegations under the second offence
DIG : Yes, indeed. We have arrested 15 suspects up to yesterday for attacking commercial establishments and places of religious worship. Among those arrested are 12 Sinhalese, two Muslims and one Tamil. The attacks have taken place at Maharagama, Nugegoda, Panadura and Kurunegala. A Buddhist monk and a policeman were also arrested. Some of the suspects have been produced in Court. Mosques have been targeted at Danture and Kurunegala.
Journalist: Racially and religiously motivated attacks are on the rise all over the country which is highly disturbing.
Minister Senaratne: Please dont make these attacks a national issue. There is no such thing. A few Sinhalese, Tamils and Muslim extremists are doing this. They are only a small group. When a doctor gives family planning advice in good faith to restrict the number of children in a family, some interpret it as an action against an ethnic group. This is how it works. (Sandun A.

A certain Diyawanna member of the main alliance of the North well-known for his long standing reverential attitude towards our countrys closest neighbor has, in a surprise move turned his guns on it, they say.

The party high-ups traditionally reliant on the neighbour as a friend in need were shocked and dismayed by the unexpected turnabout of the member and had made discreet inquiries to ascertain the cause for it.
They had discovered to their amazement that their Diyawanna colleague had gone into a big business in partnership with a super-rich red country and another discovery that they had made soon afterwards had bewildered them; their man had decided that the best and the easiest way of earning the goodwill of the red country, now that his business partner was bashing the neighbour given the long- strained relations between the two countries!

Bacteria from Australia to combat dengue: Rajitha
	
Government is planning to bring down bacteria which can successfully destroy dengue mosquitoes from Australia, Minister of Health Dr Rajirtha Senaratne told Parliament yesterday.
Referring to questions raised by the opposition MPs on usage of BTI bacteria as in the case of Cuba the minister said that country was successful not because of BTI alone. 'Cuban government applied rigid rules such as demolishing houses which were found to be dengue breeding grounds and we cannot implement such tough laws" he said.
The Minister said a new trace of Dengue which causes severe symptoms than usual have spread over to Sri Lanka There were only Dengue virus 1 or 4 in Sri Lanka earlier but a new trace have been found in the island lately," the minister said. He said it is this new trace that has caused much trouble.
He said patients are being treated in hospital clusters. Citing an example he said a cluster had been created by arranging special wards in IDH Mulleriyawa, Talanggama, and Vetara hospitals to treat the patients.
The minister accepted that there are instances where two patients occupy one bed. "Providing mosquito nets to hospital beds as patients have refused be under nets when they share beds" he said.
He said more than 700,000 breeding grounds have been found across the island and had been fumigated. (By Yohan Perera and Ajith Siriwardana)

Cholesterol control
	

Adults above the age of 40 and patients suffering from other non-communicable diseases such as diabetes, high blood pressure and heart-related diseases are advised to get a lipid profile done in order to diagnose high cholesterol.- Dr. Pradeep Kumarasinghe De Silva, Consultant Physician, Colombo National Hospital. 
Micro-organisms are the modes of transmission in many diseases which bring down ones health but it is not so where non-infectious diseases (non-communicable diseases) are concerned. Cholesterol is a lipid produced by the body. While cholesterol serves many purposes to maintain the smooth functioning of the body, when produced excessively, it could harm ones health. Dr. Pradeep Kumarasinghe de Silva, Consultant Physician of the Colombo National Hospital, speaks to the Health Capsule on cholesterol. 

What is cholesterol 
Cholesterol is a type of a lipid produced by the liver. Cholesterol serves many purposes in the body. It is a component of many hormones and serves structural purposes in cell membranes amongst other functions. The majority of the cholesterol is produced by the liver. 15% is obtained from the diet.Your brain is primarily made up of cholesterol. It is essential for nerve cells to function. Cholesterol is the basis for the creation of all steroid hormones, including oestrogen, testosterone and corticosteroids. Cholesterol is classified as low-density lipoproteins (LDL) and high density lipoproteins (HDL). While both types of cholesterol prove useful to the human body, an excess of LDL causes high cholesterol which takes an ill wind to health. 

Dangers of high cholesterol 
Dr. Kumarasinghe said excessive amounts of LDL gave rise to severe conditions such as heart disease and strokes. Excessive amounts of LDL cholesterol get deposited in the blood vessels, especially in the coronary arteries that supply blood to the heart muscles, forming a plaque. Plaques hinder the blood flow by narrowing the pathway of blood through the blood vessel. Therefore, the heart does not receive sufficient amounts of oxygen. The heart being an active organ with cardiac muscles that never fatigue, it requires a large supply of blood. When the blood supply is compromised, the heart does not receive enough oxygen, resulting in a chest pain known as angina. 
Sometimes when a plaque is formed by excess LDL, ruptured platelets form a clot in the area. When this clot is formed, it totally blocks the blood supply to the heart. It is more serious than previous instances, where the plaque only reduces the blood supply. This could lead to heart attacks and strokes. In the case of a stroke, a blood clot is formed in the heart, blocking the flow of blood to the brain. 
Another lipid component that must be taken into consideration are triglycerides, which again cause health issues in excess but the threat is less than that of LDL. These could cause pancreas-related issues such as pancreatitis, the deformation of the pancreas. HDLs are health-friendly. 

How to prevent high cholesterol 
Since cholesterol is produced by the liver, control is the main key. Ones daily diet plays a very important role in controlling cholesterol. Animal-based meals, especially beef and pork contribute to LDL levels in the body. Dairy products such as cheese, butter and egg yolk are other foods containing high cholesterol. Plant- based diets are good for the health as they do not contain cholesterol. Coconut oil is a plant-based product that does not contain cholesterol but it contains saturated fatty acids that stimulate the liver to produce more cholesterol. Dr. Kumarasinghe further stressed that regular exercises helps prevent the accumulation of cholesterol, so it is important to lead an active lifestyle. 

Diagnosis and treatment of high cholesterol 
Similar to other non-communicable diseases, high cholesterol does not show any symptoms. Therefore, Dr. Kumarasinghe advises a check-up. Adults above the age of 40 and patients suffering from other non-communicable diseases such as diabetes, high blood pressure and other heart-related diseases are advised to get a lipid profile done in order to diagnose high cholesterol. A lipid profile identifies all lipid component levels in the blood separately. A fasting period of 12 hours is required prior to a lipid profile test. The LDL level of a person who does not suffer from any other disease reaching up to 160mg/dl is considered acceptable but under the condition of a patient suffering from any other risk factors such as diabetes or hypertension, it is required to maintain ones LDL level to below 100mg/dl. HDL levels are usually around 50mg/dl. 
When LDL cholesterol rises to very high levels, physicians may prescribe the use of pharmaceutical drugs. According to Dr. Kumarasinghe the new guidelines also recommend that diabetic patients above 40 years of age with normal levels of cholesterol should use an anti-cholesterol drug. 
As in all other cases, prevention is better than cure. A healthy diet and regular exercise can take you a long way.

A powerful purohita the other day openly vented his spleen on a colleague for the being the villain responsible for the loss of his much cherished portfolio. He also said that this colleague who undercut him would never be able to win at an election. He vowed, I am going to expose all misdeeds the man has committed since entering the council through the charity list.

What is significant is that both these purohitas belong to the Green party.
By the way, a group of purohitas were engaged in small talk following a recent weekly meeting of the top team, when a colleague asked the so called charity list purohita why was it being repeatedly told that he would never be able to win a seat by a popular vote.
The charity list purohita immediately replied: Dont take what he says seriously Machang! I can win a seat from any district in the country. By the way, what was his showing at the last polls He lost to both Harsha and Sujeewa. Let him cover his nudity before finding fault with my dress!
The group greeted this angry comment with laughter.

## Title: Cutting your sugar cravings!

Cutting your sugar cravings!
	


Sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) are the biggest source of added sugar in modern diets and a major source of unnecessary calories, particularly among children, adolescents and young adults.
Excessive weight gain and obesity are results of high sugar consumption. Sugar-sweetened beverages are associated with a range of health problems including increased risk of diabetes, heart disease, cancer, chronic kidney disease, tooth decay, musculo-skeletal conditions, osteoporosis and psycho-social problems. Additionally, excessive weight gain reduces productivity and results in a poor quality of life and a shortened lifespan. 

What is SSB
Sugar-Sweetened Beverages are in short, SSB. These are:
Soft drinks 
Fruit drinks 
Sport drinks 
Energy drinks 
Sweetened milk or milk alternatives 
Tea and coffee 
Cordials 
A 330ml portion of sugar-sweetened carbonated soft drink typically contains some 35g (almost 9 teaspoons) of sugar and provides approximately 140 Kcal of energy. These excess calories are deposited in the body as fat. A high intake of SSBs can sometimes replace healthier food choices and could lead to the deprivation of essential nutrients such as vitamins, minerals and dietary fibres. 
Certain sweetened beverages contain caffeine and drinking these for prolonged periods could cause kidney stones in adults, poor sleeping habits, bed-wetting and anxiety in younger children. 
According to recent psychological studies, sugar has been shown to have an addictive effect on humans. Neurochemicals such as dopamine, tryptophan and serotonin levels elevate on sugar consumption and are responsible for raising ones mood. Sugar acts like cocaine and other addictive drugs in the brain, therefore higher levels will be needed to stimulate the brain overtime. Sugar and highly-refined food use could lead to addiction and physiological changes in the brain. Addiction can be stopped within 1-2 weeks if practised the proper way. Children in the 2-4 year age group are potent to obesity. 
Sugars makes up more than half the content in sweetened milk drinks. Adults buy their kids packeted milk due to nutritional concerns, but the truth is, this advertised nutrition is also full of sugar and children will become addicted to them. The worst outcome of getting used to drinking milk is avoiding water in the long run. 
No research has been done on sugar levels in Sri Lankas soft beverages and the levels differ from brand to brand. One glass of soft drink covers more than 70% of the daily sugar requirement. People must be aware of the threat of sugar levels in the food they consume throughout the day and must avoid sugar if soft drinks have already been taken. 

How does sugar work in the body
Sugar stores unnecessary calories in the body and the long-term consumption of sugary soft drinks cause obesity. Sugars and refined food consumption also lead to changes in the brain.

Sugars are capable of causing considerable changes in hormones, including insulin functions and other complications due to the usage of artificial chemicals. The high concentration of sugar could cause various unidentified diseases.
High sugar consumption causes tooth decay and this is why it is considered the most prevalent non-communicable disease (NCD). 
Even drinks with low calories are not good substitutes for water. These drinks do not help in reducing weight. Adults are also more affected by sugar-added drinks than children. 

What we can do
The World Health Organization (WHO) says sugar intake must be limited at least by 5% (25g of sugar or 6 tsps). 
Control sugar intake as much as possible. 
Controlling sugar intake during pregnancy can benefit the unborn childs health as well as his or her sugar consumption when older. Limit sugar during the breastfeeding period and try to consume food with their natural flavour intact without the addition of sugar or salt. 
-Do not add sugar to fruit salads, as this destroys nutrients. Better to have fruits as chunks rather than as a drink. 
-Avoid soft drinks, flavoured milk packets and energy drinks 
-Avoid artificially-sweetened drinks and food
-Opt for healthy alternatives like water, low fat/non-fat milk, 100% fruit juices, king coconut and young coconut water 
-Do not replace main meals with fast food or SSB 
-Sleep at least six hours a day 
-Be physically active and engage in gardening, walking, playing a sport or other household activities 
Addiction
One of the most worrying reasons for being unable to cut sugars is its high addictiveness. Eating fresh fruits, drinking fruit juice and pure water can aid in halting this. Fresh milk and yoghurt drinks are also considered high-energy drinks due to the substances added. If someone has highly sugary drinks throughout the year, the chances are they will add five kilos to their weight within the year. 

Sources
These views were presented by Professor Sunil Wickramasinghe - Paediatric Unit - University of Colombo, Specialist, Consultant physician Priyankara Jayawardana - National Hospital, Colombo, Dr. Rasanjali Hettiarachchi - Director, Nutrition Co-Ordination Unit- Ministry of Health, Specialist Dr. Renuka Jayatissa - Director of Sri Lanka Medical Nutrition Association (SLMNA), in a seminar held at the Health Education Bureau (HEB) regarding sugar consumption. The theme for the 2017 nutrition month is Taste Without Sugar.

Emirates says no plan to buy stake in any airline
	
Emirates has no plans to buy stakes in any airline and airport across the world, the airline has told Arabian Business.
The Dubai-based airline has clarified its stance after State Finance of Minister Eran Wickramaratne said informal talks have taken place with those, including Emirates, who have shown interest in investing in SriLankan Airlines.
Emirates confirms that it has no plans to acquire a stake in any airline and airport in Sri Lanka or elsewhere. Our business is focused on organic growth and has a pipeline of investments to renew and grow the fleet, expand the global network and continuous innovation of our products and services, an airline spokesperson has told Arabian Business.
The airline acquired a stake in SriLankan Airways in 1998 for USD70 million, but sold its share for USD53 million in 2010.
Minister Wickramaratne said the government was in contact with Emirates at the moment and has plans to hold talks with few other airlines as well.
We will not go for outright privatisation of our airline. It will be only equity sharing under the private public partnership model, he said.
Arabian Business said it has approached SriLankan Airlines for a comment.

Escaping  from middle-income trap
	
Lack of economic growth for most part following confused state of policies and patch work national endeavours lead to nowhere except stagnation and a Failed State.
Instability breeds instability. The chronic disease of lacking material comfort leads to stagnant socio-economic development over time. This can happen to any country. Creeping dissatisfaction and dissent can escalate to violence if there is no hope of steady development in sight.
At the very least there is evidence in history that lack of economic growth for most part, following a confused state of policies and patch work national endeavours lead, to nowhere except stagnation and a Failed State.
What is most urgent in such circumstances is to focus on a steady development and growth process. This discussion is to focus on the steady development and growth process aiming to escape a possible, middle-income trap on the path to progress. 
What is urgently required now is planned development together with suitable strategy replacing the patch-work pattern at the highest level of Government. 
It is well recognised that economic development is a continuum that brings about progress in a countrys economy, usually based on an agrarian (subsistence) level or status, to a high-income status, based on a diversified industrial and service sector, along with a modernised, self-sustained and productive agriculture sector. 
The process involved here is not a dichotomy or one with discreet jumps as such, though there can be no smooth line of progression. Hence development can best be described as continuum, even though the pace of change, as measured by the growth of the GDP, can be observed as slow or rapid by economists, over a period. 
Hence development economists, for generations, have shown unending quest for studying the process of economic development and growth of various countries for the benefit of all.
The economists do so to identify the critical mass, of factors, variables, systems and conditions that have worked well and effectively, to render an economys deliverables of goods and services, plus opportunities, for human needs and wants for material comforts, safety and wellness. 
Therefore, to study and understand the factors and the processes and the related problems and issues are of immense importance to business community and the policy makers, as well as the general public. 
The avowed objective in development is to transform the economy and society from the low-income level to the sustainable high-income level with equity. 
During the expected transformation of the traditional Small Farm Sector and its non-farm activities, deploying a large surplus labour accumulated over time, (Mostly underemployed) would experience a transfer of labour from it to the expanding industrial and service oriented urban sectors in the economy, in response to labour demand and increased employment opportunities. 
This transfer process would also involve a change in settlement pattern and demand for new housing areas, houses, utilities and road and transport, together with other social infrastructure (schools, hospitals, markets). 
As this transformation takes place, the structure of the economys output (GDP) and employment tends to change both in character and content, quantitatively and qualitatively. 
The outcome would be that all economic sectors, including agriculture, becoming more productive and innovative (dynamic) and would be capable of generating self-sustained growth and development, ensuring rise in incomes, and consumptions for the people- thus attaining what Rostow called high performing self sustaining growth and what this writer would like to call a State of Human Dignity and Meaningful Life. 
As pointed out recently by Kharas, (2010) this development process bring out a rising middle-class, not living off the land primarily but on knowledge, innovation and enterprise (knowledge workers) who pioneer new products and systems and technology of immense potential for trade and industry. 
The Economist calls them geeks, smart brainy people who created the Silicon Valley in the San Francisco Bay, in the US and the same journal however adds a cautionary note to say the accumulation so much wealth (Estimated to be worth over US US $3 trillion of the tech companies there on annual basis) in the US so fast comes with risks reminding the dot.com crash in 2000. Prophetic comment it is indeed, in the boom and bust of the market place economics. 
Our focus here is more on a fundamental theme of early development. How does a country experience the change when moving from low-income level to high-income level and what really is involved and are there any pitfalls that the country can slip into 
These are the questions that we in Sri Lanka should know and be familiar with, if we are to progress from where we stand now: Beginning of a middle-income stretch to the long and arduous road to the high-income status economy, where our people can enjoy good living conditions with quality lifestyle and dignity, maintaining a moral society. 
The Asian Development Bank in a recent study provides a classifications of countries according to four income levels : 
Being at (d) in this classification, one may even call this a divine class, with of course anticipated dignity in behaviour and manners and far above the Ugly American portrayal. 
This classification system though appears fine but for analytical purposes, in reality there can be some critical issues for decision makers. Particularly when moving from low-income level (less than US $ 2000 level) to higher income level of US $11,750 in per capita GDP. 
The path of progression, implicit here for a country to reach high-income status is indeed a long stretch, measuring in income rise to US $9,750, over time (That is from US $2,000 to US $11,750), this is no doubt, an arduous long walk, most probably requiring high efforts and commitment, organised and planned work and indeed sustained dedication to the cause, exemplifying, perhaps what the late Chinese leader Mao expressed as the great feat in changing to then poverty stricken China to what it is today: An economic juggernaut in Asia. It expresses a powerful message that, nothing is impossible for a collective will of a nation. 

Moving from low-income level to high-income level, a country may run in to a risk of getting entrapped in the middle-income level, what is now recognised as the middle -income trap, meaning that the country would stagnate in middle-income level for many years. 

But as our title of this discussion indicates, moving from low-income level to high-income level, a country may run in to a risk of getting entrapped in the middle-income level, which is a long stretch of income rise to get by and many a country may get caught in what is now recognised as the middle-income trap, meaning that the country would stagnate in middle-income level for many years, may be even many decades with little or no improvements in incomes and living standard of the people. 
Jumping (escaping) from the earlier low-income level to a little higher middle-income level may bring a sense of complacency to people and their government declaring, that they are progressing and the pace they are moving on is all right after all, compared to days of their grandparents. 
But the fact remains that that the rate of movement (economic growth) is too slow in Sri Lanka, and while other countries, our trade partners are moving faster, even under less favourable and less stable conditions, while we are limping. 
Domestic power game in politics and confusion that it brings about to business community and lack of steady state of affairs in a country, can bring about many distortions and disruptions to the country even in peace times to be entrapped as a country in the middle-income level for many years, disappointing people and inducing them to constantly dissent and disrupt politically and socially, reflecting a setting that lacks popular support or good will among people or the question of leadership in government. 
Whatever may be the reasons, for getting entrapped in the middle-income trap (MIT) for a country and remain there year after year is not economic development, but stagnation.  Though there is no accepted definition of what constitute a middle-income trap, except to say that staying in the wide middle-income range (US $2000 to a level less than US $7250, GDP per capita) a country is said to be trapped in middle-income, (MIT),going on for decades. 
A study by the ADB research group in 2012, covering the experience of 124 countries, from 1950 t0 2010, has identified the extent of achievement made by various countries, over the time. The distribution is as follows: 40 countries were in low-income level, 38 countries were in low middle-income level (US $2000 and less US $7,250) 14 countries as upper middle-income level (US $ 7250 to less US $11,750) and 32 as high-income level countries (US $11,750 and above). 
The study then identified the length of time that countries had remained in low middle-income, add up to 28 years or more to reach high-income and those in upper middle-income group (US $7500 and above) 14 years to reach high-income status. 
Given these two thresholds, the researchers were able to calculate the average income per capita growth required for a country to avoid the MIT. Those countries in lower middle-income level, must have at least 4.7 percent per capita growth annual on sustainable level for 28 years to avoid MIT and those in upper middle-income level must sustain an average growth rate of at least 3.5 per cent annually for 14 year to avoid the upper MIT. 
Now then, If and when Sri Lanka can reach the upper middle-income level of US $7250, in few years and if it is possible to maintain an average growth of 7 percent and little above it, annually, then it would be possible to avoid the upper MIT and possibly become high-income country in South Asia within a decade. 
In fact the ADB has identified in 2012, three (3) Asian countries, hopeful of escaping the trap soon and this group include Malaysia and Sri Lanka. 
By way of contrast recent IMF study on this same subject notes Chinas trajectory (Growth curve) has so far outstripped even that of earlier East Asian success stories, although have enjoined less than ideal political systems, but strong leaders with visions, backed by popular support for good and effective public administration systems, appear as crucial precondition for rapid development for a country to escape the MIT and attain high-income status efficiently. 
Of the many strategies available for a country to face the challenge of moving fast in development process, the crucial choice to make is to shift from the resource driven growth strategy, dependent on cheap, unskilled labour and capital (garment industry) to a strategy of economic growth, based on high-productivity and innovation involving advanced knowledge and new technology. 
This requires commitment and investments in a range infrastructure, development, specially dedicated for advanced technology education and training and high quality science biased education. 
The South Korean and Chinese, especially Taiwan, experience of building a high quality education system with a range of science schools and science parks, and centres, using PPP mode, encouraged creativity, leading them to make breakthroughs in science and technology in their respective economies. 

The fact remains the rate of movement (economic growth) is too slow in Sri Lanka. 
	
	Domestic power game in politics and confusion that it brings about to business community and lack of steady state of affairs, can bring about many distortions and disruptions to be entrapped in the middle-income level 
	
	This transfer process would also involve a change in settlement pattern and demand for new housing areas, houses, utilities and road and transport, together with other social infrastructure (schools, hospitals, markets). 
	
	As this transformation takes place, the structure of the economys output (GDP) and employment tends to change both in character and content, quantitatively and qualitatively. 

This strategy of developing science and technology savvy entrepreneur class and an educated and Science exposed work force to match, remained the key bulwark, particularly for the South Korean economic success. This led to South Korea gaining competency in cost-advantage in manufacturing of a range of sophisticated products- from ships, trucks, autos and consumer electronics-for far-flung export markets, thus gaining a competitive edge over foreign competitors-more importantly an international image of quality production.
Thus the South Korean example of a traditional agrarian economy taking up science and technology strategies seriously for development was the key factor to note here. 
The active part played by ex-army officers in developing private sector enterprises (Family businesses) must also be recognised as an endogenous Korean factor within the Korean development strategy. 
The prevailing conflict condition between North and South Koreas had not detered the pace of rapid development in South Korea. But on the contrary, the conflict appeared to have acted as a stimulant and a compelling force-not merely to survive but also to effect a massive civilian advancement and development, to outshine the dragging conflict. 
This provides a powerful message to others in similar predicament. The Sri Lankans, can read a lot into the economic histories of these of these nations, which have successfully overcome the middle-income trap (MIT).

Fishing in troubled waters
	

This purohita, a minor partner in yahapalanaya coalition, has reportedly embarked on an exercise carrying the hallmarks of a typical game plan.

A group of black-coated gents ensconced in an office run by this purohita are busy putting into shape a petition to be submitted to the famous commission in Geneva. The petition is intended to bring to the notice of the Geneva watchdogs the grievances of a community scattered across the country and while referring to the harassment that the community is being subjected to, a few barbs have been aimed at the yahapalanaya too, they say.
Meanwhile, the purohita is said to have given strict instructions to the black-coated gents involved to present the petition as their own submission and not to give any hint about his involvement.
According to some knowledgeable sources, the purohita has planned this exercise with a view to claiming credit for it at the right time, expecting to win such widespread popularity of the community so that they would look on him as their undisputed leader!

French police hold 4 family members  of Champs-Elysees assailant: Source
	
French police have taken into custody four members of the family of a radicalised Islamist who was killed when he rammed a car loaded with guns and a gas bottle into a police van on the Champs-Elysees, a judicial source said Tuesday. 
The ex-wife, brother and sister-in-law of Adam Dzaziri were detained late on Monday afternoon after police questioned them at the family home outside Paris. 
The assailants father was also taken into custody during the evening, the source said. 
Dzaziri was killed in Mondays attack, but there were no other casualties. 
Sources close to the probe said he had been on Frances security watchlist since 2015 over ties to the radical Islamist movement. 
The suspects father told AFP that his son had a registered weapon, he practised shooting. A source close to the case said the 31-year-old had a firearms permit. 
There has been no claim of responsibility for the assault, which occurred just a short distance from where a jihadist shot dead a police officer two months earlier. France remains under a state of emergency imposed after the November 2015 attacks in Paris, when Islamic State jihadists slaughtered 130 people in a night of carnage at venues across the city. The latest attack came two days before the French government is to unveil a new anti-terrorism law, designed to allow the state of emergency to be lifted.

How floods and landslides snuffed out
	
anotherinnocentfamily and property

By S. Madawala
This is a story of a tragedy that had befallen a family due to the recent floods.  A university graduate daughter had lived with her mother and elder sister in a very enchanting village called Athwelthota in the district of Kalutara. Due to the landslide that occurred in this area recently, their house had been destroyed, and the whole village was filled with tears. 
As a result of this landslide, a large mountain range had fallen, covering the Baduraliya-Kalawana road and filling a part of Athwelthota water fall with earth. This is how this tragedy struck three families mercilessly. 
Having read her degree from the University of Sabaragamuwa, the victim named Priyanthi Pushpakumari (26) spent her life with her dear mother. According to the guidance given by her mother, she was able to build a house in the same place where they lived with high hopes of life. She was in the fervent hope of getting married to a youth in June, with whom she had developed a love affair while she was in the University. 
In spite of the fact that she had applied for employment, she did not get a suitable position in keeping with her qualifications. However she had decided to get married. Shattering all the hopes she had pinned on her life for a bright future, this tragedy had struck them unexpectedly. 
The family members of this house, K. Wimalawathi (65), her elder daughter Chamila Pushpakumari (32) and the younger daughter, Priyanthi Pushpakumari (26) lived together, sharing the ups and downs of life without depending on anyone. Wimalawathis husband had passed away about 5 years ago due to a cancer, after her elder daughter had got married. 
Having gone through all the trials and tribulations in their life, Wimalawathi was able to give her elder daughter in marriage and give higher education to her younger daughter. However, they had to face this unexpected tragedy. The other daughter, Nilanthi Pushpakumari who lived separately after marriage was able to escape from this tragedy. 
This is how she explained this unfortunate incident. 
 I lost my mother and two sisters unfortunately. Our mother devoted her whole life for us. She carried out her duties towards these two sisters, keeping them at home. My younger sister finished her University education and came home with the hope of building her house and arranging her wedding.
But, sadly that all her hopes were shattered. Before facing this tragedy, my mother telephoned me and asked whether I had been inconvenienced by the floods. She said that our house was not affected although the surrounding areas were submerged with water.
The river had overflowed due to the floods, but we never thought that our house would be destroyed by a landslide. I am now faced with the problem of bearing up this tragedy. I could only wish them a good life in a future birth.

Infighting erupts in Conservative Party over who should succeed May
	
London, (Daily Mail), 20 June 2017 -  The Cabinet has broken out into infighting over who should take over as Tory Party with friends of Boris Johnson branding David Davis too old for the top job. 
The 68 year-old Brexit Secretary has been tipped to succeed Theresa May if she suddenly quits or is ousted from office. 
But allies of Mr Johnson have questioned if Mr Davis is the right man for the job amid continued speculation the former London Mayor is plotting to launch his own leadership bid. 
However, Mr Johnsons leadership hopes may be dealt a fatal blow by boundary changes which are predicted to wipe out his majority and hand his constituency to Labour.Under the changes,combined with the Corbyn surge will see his majority of around 5,000 wiped out and replaced with a Labour majority of over 1,000, according to analysis by Martin Baxter on the Electoral Calculus website. 
Friends of Mr Johnson talked down prospects of Mr Davis mounting a leadership bid and accused him of being instrumental in pushing Mrs May into holding the disastrous General Election. 
Mrs Mays leadership continues to dangle by a thread after she led her party to humiliation at the election.Mrs May has also still not brokered a deal even though the Queens Speech - which sets out the governments laws for the coming parliament - will take place tomorrow.

The dark side of Rajapaksa politics will be revealed in front of Pivithuru Hela Urumaya (PHU) General Secretary MP Udaya Gammanpila, the Jathika Hela Urumaya (JHU) said yesterday.
Denying allegations made by the parliamentarian that Minister of Megapolis and Western Development Champika Ranawaka had hidden Bodu Bala Sena (BBS) General Secretary Ven. Galagodaaththe Gnanasara Thera, the party stated that Gamampila was engaged in a mudslinging campaign. 
JHU Media Coordinator Anuruddha Karnasooriya explained that the MP who now threatened to expose party secrets played a crucial role in pushing the party to withdraw from the Rajapakse government.
It is hilarious that the individual who wanted the JHU to withdraw from the Rajapaksa government became the Rajapaksas defender. Gammanpilas challenge is a great opportunity for us to prove the dark side of the PHUs political agenda, he said.
Meanwhile, Karnasooriya also said that former president Mahinda Rajapaksa was carrying out an organized mudslinging campaign using leftists and several print and electronic media in a bid to prove the allegations they have made. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

Knowing your enemy in the Battle against Dengue
	

Dengue has raised its head more viciously than ever before, with the onset of the monsoon season. Hospitals are overflowing with dengue patients and healthcare workers everywhere are undergoing a fierce battle to monitor and treat patients with the limited staff they have. We, as responsible citizens of the country cannot wash our hands off the topic, leaving the care of patients to hospital staff and the government. The carriers of dengue are bred all around around us, in our gardens and workplaces, without out noticing. Therefore, if each of us did our part,we as a nation could eliminate this disaster from its roots.

By Punnami Amarasinghe & Gayan Suriyarachchi
 There is a saying among soldiers that you can never have too much information on your enemy. This is why the Health Capsule decided to interview Dr. Indika Ellawala, Chief Medical Officer of Health, Rathmalana, to take you through the basics of dengue, starting from the virus and the carrier to the disease, treatment and most importantly, prevention. Read on if you want to become an active soldier in the battle against dengue. 
Dengue is a disease transmitted by a virus. There are four basic types of dengue viruses, Type 1, 2, 3 and 4. Since a single virus can make you sick only once, this basically means you could get dengue four times in your life. Dont be alarmed though, because most of the time, dengue acts similarly to other viral fevers and you might have even developed the disease previously without your knowledge. 
Talking about the transmission of dengue, the virus enters the bloodstream through two mosquito breeds, the Aedes Aegyptii and Aedes Albopictus. The female mosquito usually lays eggs in clear water. Just a few spoonfuls of water is enough for them to survive. So, in addition to susceptible places like yoghurt cups, empty coconut shells, flower vases and tyres, inspect unlikely places like empty polythene bags or plant stems where water could collect. 
According to Dr. Ellawala, the female mosquito gets infected when it bites a person who has the virus in his or her bloodstream. In addition, the eggs laid by an infected female mosquito also leads to the hatching of mosquitoes that carry the virus. When these mosquitoes bite an uninfected person, they release the virus into the bloodstream. The first symptoms of the disease appear 5-7 days after an infected mosquito bite. 
Dengue can be usually present in two forms, says Dr. Ellawala. 
1) Dengue fever 
2) Dengue Haemorrhagic fever 
Symptoms of dengue are the sudden onset of high fever, severe headaches, pain behind the eyes, vomiting and muscle and joint pain. Dengue haemorrhagic fever is deadly and early diagnosis and treatment is crucial. If the fever lasts for more than two days, a full blood count will make diagnosis easier. A dengue Antigen Test can be performed with the onset of fever, says Dr. Ellawala. 
In dengue haemorrhagic fever, bleeding and shock may sometimes occur, he continued.
Symptoms of bleeding usually occur after 3-5 days of fever. If the patient is going into shock, additional symptoms like severe abdominal pain, bleeding from gums, skin bruising, frequent vomiting with blood and black stools resembling tar can occur. According to him, pale cold skin, restlessness and irritability are also signs of shock. 
If you suspect you have dengue fever, your doctor will decide if you should be admitted to hospital or not after considering your report results, age and general condition.
In case of home management, the patient should rest and take adequate fluids (water, soup, fruit juice) to bring down the fever. The only drug recommended is Paracetamol. Dr. Ellawala also advises patients to sleep under a mosquito net. 
Since dengue is a viral disease, the virus will be removed by our own immune system without the need for medication. We have to let the body do its own work. In a hospitalized patient, the main method of management is through fluid and frequent monitoring, done by checking the vital signs and conducting ultra sound scans of the body. If the patient is going into shock, resuscitation is done. Early diagnosis is essential in Dengue, stresses Dr. Ellawala. He further adds that most dengue casualties so far were due to late diagnosis and seeking of medical care when the patient was critical. 
While managing patients is important, preventing the disease occurring in the first place would be the most effective method to combat it. In addition to the obvious benefits to people, it will benefit the government as a whole because the huge expenditure spent on diagnosis and treating the ever-increasing number of dengue patients will be spared. It is found that in most cases, the source of dengue is in the house of the patient itself, comments Dr. Ellawala. Therefore, its our duty to clean the environment of mosquito breeding grounds before pointing fingers at the government and at other officials. 
Many of us have made it a point to clean our premises when we heard that a visit from Public Health Inspectors was due soon, since we fear legal action. According to Dr. Ellawala, this is not how it should be, especially at a time like this, where dengue is spreading like wildfire. We should keep our surroundings clean, not because of the fear of the dengue inspections, but because as responsible citizens, its our duty to safeguard our family and neighbours from this deadly disease. 
He advises that special attention should be given to roof gutters while cleaning premises of mosquito larvae. While at it, take care to participate in cleaning your workplace or school as well. The fact that the dengue-carrying mosquito is a day biting mosquito, makes this practice even more important since we spend most of our day time in these places.  
So the take-home messages from this article are to seek medical advice in case of a fever, especially in dengue endemic areas, refraining from using painkillers except paracetamol in case of fever and seeking immediate medical care if you develop any symptoms associated with fever. Last but not least, contribute to the ongoing battle against dengue in the best way you can, by destroying possible mosquito breeding grounds around you. This is because the most vulnerable point in the dengue cycle is the larvae stage, which is within our reach, in the breeding grounds supplied by ourselves.

## Title: Migraines More Than Just a Headache

Migraines More Than Just a Headache
	


Many people suffer from migraines at a young age but most do not know how to identify them. According to Dr. Arjuna Fernando, a Neurologist at the Colombo North Teaching Hospital, a migraine is a pounding, throbbing headache usually felt on one side of the head. By definition, a typical migraine may go on for more than half an hour. Some migraines even go on for two to three days. Usually more women suffer from migraines than men. They begin in a persons teens and continue into their 20s, 30s and 40s. Often, after about the age of 50, the severity of the headache reduces. For women, the onset of a migraine begins during their menstrual cycle and often settles with menopause. Age is not a factor, its just that we cant really diagnose it in very small children because theycant express it. 
Symptoms
Speaking of the symptoms of a migraine, Dr. Fernando said, A migraine is usually a unilateral headache. A typical migraine is felt on one side of the head. It mostly occurs in front of the head but can also be felt at the back. Sometimes the pain can localize over the eyes. As many patients feel pain over the eyes, they tend to go to an eye surgeon. 
He further said many patients experienced warning signs before the onset of a migraine. What is special about migraines is that some patients often get a warning signal that they are getting a headache. Sometimes it is preceded by flashes of light, like sparklers, sometimes they feel dizzy, like the world is spinning around, similar to vertigo. The headache is usually very severe and the patient may feel nauseous. Some will actually start vomiting. Some also show sensitivity to bright light, loud noises and even strong smells. 

Causes
Dr. Fernando said there were many causes for migraines, To start with, there is a very large genetic bias. 80% of migraines start with a family history. However, there are other general factors which precipitate migraines. The common ones are a lack of sleep, hunger, dehydration, sunlight or very bright light, wet hair after a shower-especially in the case of girls who have a shower in the evening or night. 
He further said there were various types of food and drinks that could precipitate migraines. This can vary from person to person. Almost every known food item can precipitate migraines. If you realise that a certain type of food or drink brings on a headache, its best to avoid it. The most common are alcoholic beverages such as red wine. Most fermented foods such as cheese, curd, yoghurt and achcharu are also responsible. Other foods are chocolate, coffee and oily food. However, one must bear in mind that precipitation from food and drinks are not common in everyone. 
Exhaustion from extreme exercise such as marathons or cycle rides could also be a cause. Stress is another factor. Certain people who have suffered head trauma may also have migraines. Some migraines can be precipitated due to eye problems or reading difficulties. Some children have difficulty with the coordination of their eyes since the eye muscles do not work harmoniously and do not focus on the same point. These children find it difficult to read as this precipitates headaches. There are those who are near-sighted and who struggle to see the blackboard in school, causing them to get migraines, he added. 


Phases of a migraine
Dr. Fernando further said, Many people feel a warning signal first, then they develop the headache which is where the pain component comes in. In some people, once the headache is over, they feel exhausted and go to sleep. Quite often once they sleep and awake, the migraine is gone.


Prevention is better than cure
Dr. Fernando said there was no permanent cure for migraines, so patients were advised to prevent it from worsening. Theres no complete cure for migraines. When it comes to treatment, prevention is better. Prevention would include eating on time, drinking a sufficient amount of water, avoiding sunlight, drying hair after a shower particularly for girls, having good sleep patterns and avoiding excess alcohol. Any type of alcohol can bring on migraines. 
Once a person has been diagnosed, the first thing is to take painkillers at the onset. Some people tend to take the painkiller after two days of getting the headache. However, if you take it early, you might be able to avoid the brunt of it. For those who get it because of delayed meals, we recommend that they have meals on time if they notice their hunger is accompanied with migraines. We also advise patients to go to a quiet place and lie down if possible, he added.

Multi Plugs to be banned, square pin plugs to be the standard: PUCSL
	
The use of square pin plugs in future will be the standard for Sri Lanka and as such the import and manufacture of appliances other than G-plugs commonly known as square pin plugs will be banned in future, Public Utilities Commission (PUCSL) said.
The Commission has decided that the Type G-plug and socket outlet, widely known as the 13 Ampere plug and socket outlet, commonly referred to as the Square Pin plug and socket is to be the national standard in Sri Lanka,

To plug these different plug-tops for different socket outlets people tend to follow unsafe actions such as
Use of Low quality multi sockets (multi plugs)
	Use of low quality extensions
	Permanently blocking the earth hole to keep the gates open (Ex. Inserting pens / pencils to the earth hole)
	Inserting naked wires in to sockets
There has been some 95 electrocutions in 2015 up from 76 in 2013 and 73 in 2014. Use of substandard plugs, sockets, electrical accessories, adaptors and extension cords are one of the main causes for electrocution and fire.
To mitigate these unsafe practices and to standardize use of plugs and related materialsin Sri Lanka,Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL) has introduced a new set of standards. 
Manufacturing and Importing
With effect from August 2017 all Electrical equipments and appliances manufactured or imported must only contain 13 Ampere square pin plugs only(This standard applies for Mobile phone charges as well)
	
	Only 13 Ampere plugs/sockets (type G) will be permitted to be manufacture or imported with effect from August 2017.
	
	All extension cords manufactured or imported with effect from August 2017 must contain only 13 Ampere sockets and an inbuilt fuse
Sale of Plugs and Sockets
With effect from August 2018 only 13 Ampere plugs and Sockets could be sold (sale of all types other than type - G plugs and sockets will be banned)
	
	With effect from August 2018 only Extension Cords with 13 Ampere sockets and an inbuilt fuse could be sold (sale of all other types of Extension cords will be banned)
	
	With effect from August 2018 all electrical equipment's and appliances sold must contain 13 Ampere Plugs (Type - G)
For consumers who are already using Non standardized types of plugs and Sockets, it is not mandatory to change it immediately , but if there is a need arises to change or replace an existing plug point PUCSL recommends the public to purchase only a square socket plug which is been tagged as "6A Max".

Myanmar sentences exorcist to death for child murders
	
YANGON AFP June20, 2017- A self-proclaimed sorcerer was sentenced to death by a Yangon court on Tuesday for killing three children in an exorcism ritual he believed would banish evil spirits that possessed them. 
Black magic practitioner Tun Naing was convicted of beating to death two toddlers and an eight-month-old baby late last year in a tiny village outside Myanmars commercial capital. 
Witnesses said he told villagers the children were possessed by evil sprits before attacking them as their spellbound families watched. Hospital workers alerted authorities after the father of another little girl who had been beaten brought her to hospital covered in bruises.

Mystery about the missing portrait
	

Many locals who had occasion to visit the diplomatic mission of a powerful red country in recent times had been surprised to find a portrait of the former strongman prominently displayed on a wall in the mission office.

A purohita in yahapalanaya during a visit to this diplomatic mission had openly expressed surprise at the prominent display of the portrait of the former head of State as something unusual. And a mandarin at the mission had immediately reacted with the quip: Regimes may change. But we dont forget our friends!
This portrait took centre-stage again when reports said that it had suddenly gone missing from the wall it was hung on quite recently.
Some sources say that the portrait was removed on orders from above. Of course, mandarins at the missions are tight-lipped about it.
However, some JO members believe that the removal of the portrait could be the response to tales carried to the top leaders of the powerful country that JO had begun getting pally with the closest neighbour.

BUSTED:No, nothing will happen. If you are able to read in low lighting, the sensitivity of your eyes are good. This means that you can see very well even in dark light, implying that your vision is very good. There are children who cant tolerate bright lights because they have a problem with their eyes. If children or adults prefer reading in lower lighting conditions there will be no strain to the eyes, explained Dr. M. Wijetunge, Retired Consultant Eye Surgeon, Ragama Teaching Hospital.

NCCSL urges Govt. to protect religious freedom
	
The National Christian Council of Sri Lanka (NCCSL), which represents the majority of non-Roman Catholic churches expressed its concern over the views expressed by some parties with regard to threats and attacks on Christian places of worships.
NCCSL, an ecumenical body represented by 11 national churches and nine ecumenical organiza-tions said that it was disturbed by some of the views expressed over the past few days in relation to the violence, intimidation and the threat posed against Christian churches in the country.
The statement was signed by the leaders of mainline churches including Bishop of Colombo, Church of Ceylon, Rt. Rev. D.R. Canagasabey, Bishop of Jaffna Diocese, Church of South India, Rt. Rev. Dr. Daniel S. Thiagarajah, President/Bishop, Methodist Church of Sri Lanka, Rev. Asiri P. Perera, President of Sri Lanka Baptist Sangamaya, Rev. Priyantha Wijegoonawardene, Pres-ident of Christian Reformed Church, Rev. Stanley Nelson and Chairperson of the NCCSL and the President of Presbytery of Lanka Rev. Saman Perera.
We reiterate the fact that Christian churches have been subject to violence, intimidation and threats over the past few years. This is in addition to the many ongoing issues that the Christian community faces with regard to the construction of places of worship, the registration of churches, house churches, Christian education in state schools and the forced closure of churches etc. which successive governments have failed to address despite us having made clear representations to the relevant authorities, they stated.
We are of the opinion that the current crisis, which has been precipitated through TV debates and pronouncements of politicians, is only trying to deal with the visible wounds and symptoms of a problem without trying to address the root causes, they stated.
Signed by ecumenical organistions including Young Mens Christian Association (YMCA), Young Womens Christian Association (YWCA), Student Christian Movement (SCM) and the Ceylon Bible Society, the statement stressed that the NCCSL has recognise that many of the problems face by minority Christians are precipitated by the actions of a small number of extremist elements within each religion.
The NCCSL also urged that it was important that law and order should be enforced by the police without bias and fear, it stated and appealed to the government to take immediate steps to seek to resolve the underlying problems faced by religious minorities in the country.

No need for emergency evacuation of Sri Lankans: Qatar
	
The Qatari Embassy in Colombo has said on Tuesday that there were no plans of an emergency evacuation of 150,000 Sri Lankans in the Gulf state, foreign media reported.
The embassy advised Sri Lankans not to be misled by reports on emergency evacuation plans for the 150,000 Sri Lankans in Qatar, which the embassy dubbed as their "second home."
"Officials from Sri Lankan Foreign Ministry and the embassy in Doha confirmed that there is no need for such measures as the diplomatic rift left no adverse impacts on the normal life of citizens and the expatriates as well," the Qatari Embassy said.
Bahrain, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Yemen cut diplomatic ties and transport links with Qatar earlier this month after accusing the small Gulf state of supporting terrorism and aligning with Iran.
Sri Lanka said last week that it has not taken any decision with regard to the crisis in the Gulf following the isolation of Qatar, but will hold talks with other countries and decide on the way forward.

The irate purohita is said to have conveyed his displeasure to the highest echelons.
I dont want that man, the purohita had told Number One. He had later addressed the new secretary: You are not wanted here. You had better go back to where you came from!
Meanwhile, the secretary had received another order from above: You go back to where you were before!

OMP Amendment Bill passed unanimously in House
	
The Office of Missing Persons (Establishment, Administration and Discharge of Functions) Amendment Bill was unanimously passed in Parliament today.
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, presenting the Bill to the House, said it was being presented in line with an agreement the government had with the opposition to present it in Parliament prior to the establishment of the OMP.
This institution is paramount in order to put an end to the issue pertaining to the disappearance of persons as soon as possible, he said.
In response to a question raised by joint opposition Parliamentary Group Leader Dinesh Gunawardene as to whether the members of the OMP had already been appointed, the PM said they would be appointed only after the Amendment is passed.
MP Namal Rajapaksa pointed out that the several clauses in Office of Missing Persons (Establishment, Administration and Discharge of Functions) Bill will become defunct when the new Bill pertaining to forceful disappearances comes into effect.
JVP MP Bimal Ratnayake said the amendment made yesterday would not guarantee that the government would expedite the establishment of the OMP.
Minister Dayasiri Jayasekera said the Bill is essential in order to put to bed issues pertaining to disappearances that have been taking place for years.
TNA MP M A Sumanthiran pointed out that the LTTE too was culpable when it came to such disappearances and not just the security forces. (Yohan Perera)

On what criteria Lotteries board assigned to FM
	
The Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) said yesterday President, Prime Minister or the subject minister has not revealed to the country on what basis the lotteries board was assigned to the foreign ministry.
JVP MP Sunil Handunnetti told Parliament that according to the lotteries board act, the finance minister should be the subject minister and added that the government would have to amend the Lotteries Board Act to change the subject minister as the foreign minister.
He said the institutions which come under the purview of the finance ministry should be allocated to it because they were formed under certain Acts and Bills.
He said stability in monetary policy and finance sector depended on the confidence placed on the ministry.
Handunnetti said the move to change lotteries board under foreign ministry was humiliated in social media and added that it was the country which was humiliated ultimately and not the minister. (By Ajith Siriwardana and Yohan Perera)

He told a news conference that he felt he was responsible for some of the complaints made by the Theras.
Therefore, I take this opportunity to apologies to the prelates for their annoyance over me or the government, the minister said.
He said the prelates were of the view that the government did not respect Bodu Bala Sena General Secretary Galagodaaththe Gnanasara Thera.
"As a government, we do not approve his behaviour. However, we cant label him a racist. He has also been vocal on some pressing issues and found solutions for them amid struggles. We should admire his perseverance," the minister said.
He said it was the obligation of the government to create an atmosphere where members of different religions could live in harmony.
Meanwhile, referring to the regaining of the GSP plus facility, the minister said Sri Lanka was isolated by the world community from 2010 to 2015 but with the regaining of this facility, the country had found access to the global arena.
"We were deprived of the GSP concession by the European Union during the previous regime over the situation prevailing in the country at that time. But the situation changed after this government came to power. We should express our gratitude to the EU. This is a great victory by this government," he said. (Sheain Fernandopulle)

Serious Fraud Office charges Barclays, ex-CEO over Qatar funding
	
AFP: Britains Serious Fraud Office said yesterday it had charged Barclays, a former chief executive of the banking giant and three other ex-managers, with conspiracy to commit fraud linked to emergency fundraising from Qatar during the financial crisis.
The SFO added in a statement that former chief executive John Varley was one of those to face court following a five-year investigation. The Serious Fraud Office has today charged Barclays Plc and four individuals with conspiracy to commit fraud and the provision of unlawful financial assistance linked to capital raising from Qatar in 2008 worth billions of pounds (euros/dollars).
The charges relate to Barclays Plcs capital raising arrangements with Qatar Holding LLC and Challenger Universal Ltd, which took place in June and October 2008, the SFO said.
It added that they relate also to a $3-billion loan facility made available to the State of Qatar acting through the countrys Ministry of Economy and Finance in November 2008.
The other three charged are Barclays former executive chairman of investment banking Roger Jenkins, the former chief executive of Barclays wealth and investment management Thomas Kalaris and former European head of financial institutions group Richard Boath. The defendants will appear before Londons Westminster Magistrates Court on July 3, the statement added.
In a separate statement, Barclays said it is considering its position in relation to these developments as it awaits further details of the charges from the SFO. UK watchdog the Financial Conduct Authority already fined Barclays 50 million in 2013 after the bank failed to disclose fees it paid to the Qatari investors. Barclays contested the fine however, which has been on hold awaiting the SFO outcome. In addition, US authorities are probing the payments.
In a statement Tuesday, the FCA said: We welcome a fair and transparent hearing on the basis of the charges set out today by the SFO. SFO Investigations had focused on advisory services worth 322 million, which Barclays agreed to pay the Qatar Investment Authority.
By raising money from Qatar, Barclays avoided a UK government bailout at a time when rivals Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds had no choice but to be pumped with billions of pounds of British taxpayers money.
Speaking to BBC radio Tuesday, former treasury minister Paul Myners said Barclays bosses were vehement that they did not want a government bailout in 2008. I think firstly there was a real fear on their part that this was nationalisation, it was political, they didnt want anything to do with a Labour government, Myners said.
Secondly, they realised that the terms we were imposing meant that pay for their senior bankers and bonuses and options were going to be substantially reduced. So they managed to find capital from elsewhere.
That surprised a lot of people, and that is the background to the investigation that the SFO has now been conducting for the last five years, he added. Tuesdays announcement meanwhile comes as current Barclays chief executive Jes Staley is facing a probe by regulators after he tried to uncover the identity of a whistleblower.
Around 1000 GMT, shares in Barclays were down 0.3 percent at 206 pence on Londons benchmark FTSE 100 index, which was flat overall.
The muted reaction in the share price highlights the fact that the SFO action was largely priced in, said Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at stockbroker Hargreaves Lansdown. Litigation, fines and compensation payments have sadly become part and parcel of thebanking world.

Sinking under the weight of redundant political appointees
	

Several state-owned undertakings which have already become white elephants have sunk deeper into the red due to overstaffing with political appointees, they say.

A State-owned flying venture, for example, had during the past two years itself recruited more than 1,000 persons for (no)-work in various sections. Most of these new recruits are from the Kegalle district. They go about doing nothing while being on the payroll, an inside source said.
Meanwhile, another loss-making state undertaking handling construction work has been saddled with a redundant workforce of about 500. The issue of state undertaking getting too heavy both at the top and the bottom due to being packed with political henchmen had come up at a recent meeting of the top team and the new broom now busy sweeping the countrys finances clean had at this meeting warned that State ventures now on their last legs would soon breathe their last unless prompt action was taken to save them.

SL Port development: France keen on making a presence
	
France has been closely following the developments taking place in the Sri Lankan ports, especially in Colombo because some french companies are also interested in making their presence here, French Ambassador Jean-Marin Schuh said yesterday.
He said this at a news briefing held on board the French helicopter carrier-Landing Helicopter Dock (LHD) Mistral which called on the Colombo Port as part of the Jeanne d Arc mission of the French Navy.
When asked whether the French have any concerns over Chinese involvement in Sri Lankan ports, the Ambassador said his country was following the port developments in Hambantota and the East Terminal in Colombo.
He said France was always very careful, attentive and watchful as to the expressions of interest and the needs in terms of capabilities of the Sri Lankan forces. We are following quite closely about the needs of the Sri Lankan navy as well, the Ambassador said.
Referring to the challenges visible in the Indian Ocean, he said human smuggling, narcotics, piracy and terrorism were the challenges faced by the regional countries including Sri Lanka.
LHM Mistral's Commanding Officer Captain Stanislas de Chargers said they would organise joint exercises with the Sri Lankan Navy, focusing on anti-piracy and anti-narcotics missions, using the Special Forces of the French Navy.
This was the first time a helicopter carrier of the French Navy had visited Sri Lanka and it was also the first time a military ship of the Jeanne d Arc mission did so. Frigate Courbet, the La Fayette-type ship also called on the Colombo Port accompanying the helicopter carrier.
Jeanne d Arc is an amphibious battle mission which is built around the LHD Mistral and Frigate Courbet.
The mission aims at enhancing the naval relations among the French Navy and the navies of the visiting countries, and it also gives a better understanding to the French Navy to intervene into a crisis situation on the command of the President of France.
Also, the operational deployment is a practical training course in real-life conditions for 137 French and foreign midshipmen graduating from the French Naval Academy.
The LHD Mistral and Frigate Courbet sailed from Toulon, France on February 28 this year commencing the Jeanne d Arc mission. It has so far visited Djibouti, India, China, Japan and Guam prior to calling on Colombo Port. The two ships will depart on July 26 for Djibouti again. (By Lahiru Pothmulla)

The truth about school admissions
	
Instead of quotas for security forces MPs list becomes the order of the day as regulations are openly flouted by politicians in the admission of children to schools

Two little ones cling on to their mother and father happy as ever on their way to school to begin their new lives, while two other little ones remain in their homes yearningly looking at the former, after their hopes of attending a new school almost shattered.

These are twins. Their father is a teacher. He laments and questions whether his children failed to get a new school because he was a teacher. He directed this question to the Sri Lanka Human Rights Commission after anxiously waiting for five months expecting that his daughters would gain admission to a school.
By this time applications for admission of children to Grade One next year had been issued, but however as appearing in the preamble there are children of school-going age qualified for admission in January, still waiting for admission to schools.
Our story began with twins, who are from Gampaha. They have qualified for admission to a girls college in the Gampaha town but in vain. Their woes of not finding a school should be inquired as similar situations had risen in many parts of the country.
The Circular No. 17/2016 relating to the admission of children to Grade One in 2017 was released by the Secretary to the Ministry of Education on May 16, 2016. According to which applications had to be called, interviews held and mark-lists and waiting-lists exhibited. The Appeal Board meets thereafter. This is the procedure that is being followed every year.
With the overwhelming rush for admissions to popular schools every year, fraud, corruption and irregularities take place. Only a few get caught for these crimes.
It seems that flouting all regulations politicians had taken over the admissions of children to schools into their hands. Instead of the quotas for the members of the Security Forces, MPs lists seem to have become the order of the day.
There is a quota for the children of the members of the Armed Forces and the Police, who were in active service or presently in it, under which five children can be admitted to a class.
In a school where four sections exist at the rate of five students per class, twenty children are allowed to be admitted under the Active Service Quota.
When sufficient numbers are not available under this quota, there is no definite indication in circulars prior to 2016, as to how the shortfall is to be filled up. Sources said this is where the politicians interfered.

Western Province Leads In the battle for school admissions
Prior to the Circular No. 17/2016 covering admission of children for 2017, the Circular that governed the admission of children to Grade One was Circular No. 23/2013 and Circular Nos 2013/23 (1), 2013/23 (11) and 34/2015. Admissions to Grade One was done in accordance with these circulars. By December 2016, interviews had to be completed, Appeal Boards conducted and final lists decided upon and admission of children completed in January.
When arrangements were in line for the usual balance available for the Active Service Quota to be filled by political lists, the Secretary to the Ministry of Education issued another circular in April 2016, laying down further instructions. It detailed how the vacancies that had originated from the balance quota of active services to be filled up.
With the issue of this circular, political lists had no more say on this matter and the balance vacancies were distributed among the other categories.
By May 2016 admissions of children to schools in the Western Province had been completed and the Zonal Directors confirmed that there were no requests from any children deprived of an admission to school. While this was so on July 25, 2016, the then Zonal Director of Education Wimal Gunerathne received a letter from a responsible politico in the Western Province.
Which read that, In the admission of children for Grade One in the Western Province, in some school class rooms are full and with many children seeking admission, the Ministers of the Western Provincial Council members are requesting me in this regard.
According to circular regarding the admissions to Grade One the number of students in a class should not exceed 40. In those schools there is a provision for an additional class to be set up in selected schools.
A list of schools had also been appended to this letter.
The schools mentioned therein were regarded as popular schools. Not stopping at that, a list of names of children, who should be admitted to these extra classes, was also sent by the politicos
Coordinating Secretary to the Western Province Education Director. The schools are:
Malabe Boys Model School, Kottawa Dharmapala Junior College, Nugegoda Samudra Devi Girls College, Piliyandala Somaweera Chandrasiri College, Rawatawatte Methodist College, Avissawella Presidents College, Padukka Siri Piyarathna College, Sangamitta Girls College Colombo 08,Fathima Muslim Girls College Colombo Central, Ashoka College Colombo 10, Al Khariya Muslim Girls College, Gampaha Yasodhara Devi Girls College, Attanagalle Ranpokunagama College, Biyagama Sapugaskanda Vishaka College, Mahara Dammadassi Maha Vidyalaya, Panadura Agamethi Girls College, Panadura Royal College, Kalutara Gnanodaya Vidyalaya, Darga Town Gnanissara College, Horana Thakshila College and Matugama St. Marys Maha Vidyalaya.
When the year is about to end what is the urgency in increasing the number of classes is any bodys guess. As this was illegal, the Education Director of the Western Province kept opposing it.
On August 1, 2016 the Secretary to the Governor of the Western Province inquired from the
Education Director of Western Province on increasing the number of classes, and in his reply the Director had submitted acomprehensive report.
In his reply he pointed out that it is not practical to increase classes considering the facilities that are available at schools. The Zonal Directors had confirmed that there were no children without schools and it did not warrant opening of additional classes.
Zonal Director Wimal Gunerathnes stern objections costed him his post. He was removed from the post of Provincial Director of Education.
With his absence additional classes were established in some schools. However, children were not admitted in the proper manner. As indicated earlier by us, Gampaha Girls College was also one where an additional class was established. Teacher Associations criticised this act.
How the selections were made, were the children qualified, who interviewed them, if they had been victimised, did they approach the appeal boards were some questions that begs answers.
An investigation would bring more to light. This is only one story about GradeOne admissions.
The teacher who couldnt gain admission to his two daughters to Grade One at the Gampaha Girls College applied under three categories.
Under proximity he applied as all requirements had been fulfilled. He also applied under Education staff, and well-knowing that he would have to present at interviews on all categories mentioned by him. But it did not happen that way. He was called for the interview at the Gampaha Girls College only under the close proximity to the college. According to the Circular the distance to the College from the residence should be calculated overland, it has been calculated based on the walking distance and as an excuse the interview board had said The child is not going to fly here, but walk on the road, and therefore, we have calculated the distance the child has to walk.
This shows the lack of basic knowledgeof interviewers.
His daughters had also obtained 95 marks. But surprisingly when the pending-list was published their names had been omitted and children who had got lower marks had been selected. Their names had been included in the waiting-lists under number 13 and 14.
While all the conditions had been fulfilled and the application was forwarded under fewer than three categories, the interview board had called under one category. When inquired about this matter the Principal of the school failed to reply. The responsibility of calling applicants for interviews as per the circulars rests on the school Principal. The parent was later requested to appear before the appeal board, but again the appeal was considered under the proximity category and not under education personnel category.
The appeal board was chaired by a school Principal of another school in the area. There had been two others, who were in the interview panel, and lacked the presence of persons who were mentioned as eligible in the circulars. The appeal board took into consideration all facts and rewarded 80 marks. However, when he met the appeal board he was informed that the children of the applicant cannot be admitted.
The chairman had reportedly accused that there was a change in the name of the father.
The applicant, being a teacher himself, had then produced all documents pertaining to the name change to prove it had been done legally. Proving his position only earned scant regard from the chairman, who made a remark on the application that the documents in support were incomplete. Under the proximity category these two children obtained 95 marks, but children who had obtained only 91 marks were selected for admission to the school. Despite these facts, (and being children obtaining 80 marks under the education staff category) they were disqualified and children who had obtained 63 marks had been considered.
The father then approached the Zonal Director for admission in any school, but all his attempts failed and finally he had to appeal to the Sri Lanka Human Rights Commission.
Why these two children were refused admission still remains to be answered. Is it to pave the way for the children ofpolitical henchmen
Admitting children under the Security Services quota itself is a problem, sources said. It is a ruse used by many Principals to admit children through the back door.
The following is a report of an unqualified child gaining admission to the same school. The latter does not come under the restricted area and therefore cannot be summoned for an interview and no question arises about an appeal. From the records available this childs father was born in or about 1982. They were not called for the interview and hence no invitation followed from the appeal board.
The address given is the address of a Kapurala of a Devale. A lease-hold deed, purported to have been executed in 1994 was produced as proof of residence. No official verified the claim. Despite inadequate documents, the child was admitted. 
In our investigations we found four more children had been admitted to this school despite them having not fulfilled the conditions.
A few months ago seven members including a school Principal and teachers from another school, who constituted the appeal board of the Royal College Colombo were interdicted and while the investigations by the Public Services Commission was ongoing theywere reinstated. If this trend is not stopped now it could pose greater issues in the future. Aggrieved parents could seek redress under ordinary laws or complain to the Bribery Commission or to the Police Fraud Bureau.

THESE MUST STOP NOW
	
Sustainable production and consumption: The zero distance argument

Back in 2007 I was on an agricultural training program and giving a talk to farmers in the Aluvihare area of Matale about the various crises in transport, food, energy, climate, finance and garbage.
While they listened attentively enough, as the talk progressed, I got the distinct feeling that I was not really engaging them. Finally, when I was done, a middle aged man who had been standing slightly aside from the group beckoned me to his side. He was Arunasiri he informed me, a man who had farmed his one acre of uplands and one acre of paddy lands for forty years. Summarized, this is what he told me Sir, I agree that there seems to be a problem with quality of food and cost of food. But I dont have that problem because I grow all the food I need organically. I have never had to sit at my table with less than six separate dishes to choose from. I know that fuel prices are very high but most of my fuel needs are served by firewood picked from my own lands or from the vicinity and my family goes to sleep by eight oclock so we use very little electricity.
I also agree that some people have issues with transport. But I dont have that problem because I go to town only once every three months and only to buy salt, dried fish, blades, soap and toothpaste. Once a year I buy a couple of new sarongs and shirts. I earn about 2,000 rupees a month by selling a few fruits on the roadside and that is quite enough for everything I need to buy. I know that may people use bins to put garbage in but I do not think of anything as garbage so I dont need a bin. Most of the people you spoke to are like me. What you speak of may be true of the rest of the world but for us, these things have never been problems so we are wondering what to do with what you say.
Although rueful that my effort of the morning was wasted I nevertheless smiled with genuine happiness for in Arunasiri I saw a completely sustainable man, living in a sustainable community in a sustainable village.


To reduce transport kilometres consumers need only to work and study a percentage of time from their places of residence and to eradicate those kilometres, work and study exclusively from home.


Where he is now I do not know. Neither do I know if his village has succumbed to the insanity and impropriety of the world in the decade that followed. However, the reason underlying his killer missive of your problems have never been my problem is ragingly relevant to us today as we deal with infinitely exacerbated versions of those very crises I spoke about that day.
What do we have today We have Asia growing the largest amount of food but also having the largest number of starving people in the world. We are bleeding money to power our lives with geometrically increasing fuel prices, while largely ignoring our own renewable sources.
We carelessly bring home and discard 2,500 metric tons of material a day and are literally and figuratively being mowed under by an avalanche of garbage. The price of money has sky-rocketed. Having made all of these things come to pass, we call ourselves civilized, sensitive and intelligent when in fact, the opposite is true.
The reason is not that hard to understand. Connecting people with goods that were produced on the other side of the planet is a horribly unsustainable exercise that was the great, world destroying mantra of the industrial age. With every increase in the miles between the minds and markets of the producer and the consumer, everything becomes more difficult, more expensive, more wasteful and more toxic.
A key difference between the industrial age and the sustainable age is the fact that in the sustainable age, minimising this distance between producer and consumer is mandatory.

Doing these things will reduce the carbon footprint of every citizen for all of these areas are high in energy consumption when indulged in using industrial age sensibilities. Most importantly...


Taking the argument to its highest point, the sustainable age must strive to reduce that distance to zero at every possible point. The only way to achieve that is to make the producer the consumer or vice-versa as farmer Arunasiri and his community had done so many years ago.
To reduce food kilometres, consumers need only to grow a percentage of their food and to eradicate those kilometres, grow all of the food that they consume. Even urban Sri Lanka is comparatively green and we have a tradition of growing steeped in our agricultural heritage that is easily leveraged for the purpose. Happily, with the present government committed to localizing food production and consumption, they have the ability and the capability of lending a helping hand to any and all who wish to engage in food production for their own consumption. Not simply in rural settings but (especially) in urban habitats.
To reduce energy kilometres, consumers need only to generate a percentage of their energy and to eradicate those kilometres, generate all of their energy. Once again, the government has created the enabling environment for consumers to create their own energy through the battle for solar energy initiative that provides substantial technical and financial assistance to those (especially) in urban settings to generate their own power.
To reduce transport kilometres consumers need only to work and study a percentage of time from their places of residence and to eradicate those kilometres, work and study exclusively from home. Here too, modern technology is already eminently capable of providing what is required for person-to-person interconnects that do not require them to be in the same physical space. Doing these things will reduce the carbon footprint of every citizen. Most importantly though, it reduces waste geometrically. But will we Many of us will think of all of these alternative exercises as either a lot of work or not worth the time. If we qualify in any way to the title intelligent this should have ended decades ago but beings creatures of habit, addicts, we have let the runaway train of casual producer-consumer convenience gather so much momentum that it threatens, not only to throw the entire human race off track.
I have hope though, that people will sit up, remove their pink-tinted glasses and see the world for what it truly is. See that we have run out of time. See that enabling that future mandates that these bad habits must be broken-that these horror addictions are kicked out. See that like all such things, these must stop and that they must stop now.

## Title: Transport Ministry, Motor Traffic Dept  Responsible for Traffic accident hike

Transport Ministry, Motor Traffic Dept  Responsible for Traffic accident hike
	
Eight Sri Lankans losing their precious lives in road collisions daily, it is high time that we as concerned professionals addressed numerous facets of Traffic Accidents and discuss matters topical, especially the proposed increase in traffic fines. 
In this context, I wish to place the following extracts drawn from the final report presented in Parliament on December 12, 2014 by a Select Committee which looked into the alarming increase in traffic accidents. 
The following information, which would refresh your memory in deciding whether the proposed increase in traffic fines should be implemented, will be important. Extracts from the report along with my observations have been included. The Government bears the primary responsibility for road safety. Traffic accidents need to draw serious attention of the Government, in addition to the political will and the commitment of the Government. 
Improving road safety should be considered as a social imperative and the Government should be held accountable for its actions and failures. 
Road accidents are a huge and complex problem  and active participation of many organisations and sectors is required to overcome this situation. 
The conditions of roads are one of the important factors causing traffic accidents. This is recognised by road safety experts all over the world. 
World Health Organisation identify the status of roads as a major factor for accidents. Therefore regular maintenance of roads is equally important to achieve road safety. 
According to the National Road Master Plan (2007-2017) of the Road Development Authority, at Independence in 1948, Sri Lanka had about 11,000 km of trunk roads (Highways), of which 7,000 km were paved 
Accordingly, only a little mileage (B class roads)  726 Km  has been added to the road network in Sri Lanka in the past 64 years after Independence: A roads-nil, AB roads- nil, and AC roads- nil, except for the two expressways. Nevertheless, the total vehicle population of the country has increased by about 298 percent in the past 16 years. The vehicle population in 2000 was 1,706,382 and it had increased to 6,795,469 in 2016  a 298 percent increase. 
The Ministry of Highways in its website has acknowledged the inadequacy of the road network to meet the increasing traffic volume. As per the website, even though Sri Lanka has an extensive road network, most roads were built about 50 years ago and do not possess the capacity to cope with increasing traffic volumes. Therefore theres an urgent need to improve the capacity and efficiency of the road network to meet the growing transport requirements of the country and avoid the road network becoming an impediment to national development. Any delay in improving the road network to meet the increasing number of vehicles will lead to greater traffic congestion and a higher rate of accidents, especially in the urban areas, and economic loss. 
Traffic levels now exceed the designed capacity of many trunk roads. Increasing traffic volumes and a traffic mix consisting of motorised and non-motorised traffic have resulted in low traffic speeds, severe traffic congestions and increased accident rates. The capacity constraints have created severe safety problems. 
Expansion of road network
According to the Asian Development Bank, the road capacity in Sri Lanka will need to be doubled every 08 to 10 years to meet the rising demand. 
Ministry of Transport
It is the responsibility of the Transport Ministry to provide the public with an efficient and safe system of transport  both by road and rail at affordable cost and a service that is responsive to social and economic development needs in the country. 
Traffic congestion
Traffic congestion has become a major challenge on Sri Lankan roads, especially in urban areas. Traffic congestion may be defined as having more vehicles on the road than it was designed for. 
Trend in use of private vehicles
The use of private vehicles has increased rapidly over the past 12 years. Three wheelers and motorcycles which are more prone to accidents contribute immensely for this increase: 
The Department of Motor Traffic
- Supervision of driving schools
The committee sees an urgent need to maintain a continuous supervision of driving schools by the Motor Traffic Department to ensure proper licensing and driver training under a uniform curriculum. 
Surprise inspection
Action to be taken to appoint raid parties to conduct surprise inspection of driving schools by a team comprising officials of the Transport Ministry, the Department of Motor traffic and Police (excluding the Examiner of Motor Vehicles). 
Task Force
The Ministry of Transport may establish a task force to carry out surprise checks on driver training schools with the participation of officials from the Ministry, the Department of Motor Traffic and Police (excluding the Examiner of Motor Vehicles). 
License issuing systemto be improved
The Present system of issuing licenses by the Department has to be improved with a new computerised system, subject to a mandatory probationary period. 
Unsatisfactory practical tests
Apparently due to unsatisfactory practical tests conducted by the Department in issuing driving licences, inexperienced drivers get involved in accidents.  
- Ministry of Law and Order and Department of Police
The Ministry of Law and Order and its main law enforcement arm  the Police Department. Although the task of the Police is unenvious, they still need to maintain the highest standards of integrity and road discipline while carrying out their duties often under trying conditions. 
Law enforcement
Effective traffic law enforcement plays an important role in reducing traffic accidents. 
- Strict implementation of existing laws
The road users in Sri Lanka, like in other developing countries, have a tendency to break traffic laws, since laws are not strictly implemented. 
- Accident statistics to be co-related
A comparison of accidents data compiled by the Police and the Insurance Association of Sri Lanka show a high discrepancy.
Hence the statistics can be rather misleading and not conducive to research and planning activities.
Act No. 08 of 2009 requires drivers to report accidents at Police Stations. Apparently, there is reluctance on the part of drivers to report accidents at police stations perhaps due to inconvenience involved, time taken to record statements, and to get the vehicles released from stations. 
Driver Improvement Point System
Aimed at reducing road accidents, the Department of Motor Traffic under MTA section 123, 133A and 139 E came up with a driver improvement point system in driving licences. The system has not yet been implemented due to a few practical problems. 
Updating the Highway Code
The present Highway Code was gazetted in 1987. The Department of Motor Traffic should take early steps to update the Highway Code. 
Several requests to update the Code have been made to the Commissioners General of Motor Traffic in the past 30 years but little or nothing has happened. 
Endorsement form (MTA 32C)
The Ministry of Transport or the Department of Motor Traffic has so far not issued endorsement forms to motorists and to new drivers who pass the driving test. 
The endorsement form should be part and parcel of ones driving licence and should be produced to a police officer on request. It refers to section 135/1A of the Motor Traffic (Amendment) Act No 8 of 2009. Any person who fails to carry a valid learners permit or regular driving license including the endorsement form while driving a motor vehicle shall be guilty of an offence and shall on conviction be liable to a fine not less that Rs 2,500 and not exceeding Rs 5,000. 
National Policy and Action Plan
The Committee recommends that a National Policy on Road Safety be formulated based on matters highlighted in its report. 
It is clear that the proposed increase in traffic fines for motorists cannot be justified with the restrictions and constraints placed against them since 1984 and with the inadequacy of the road capacity to cope with the increase in traffic volume by 298 percent. The motorists have been prevented from following or obeying the road rules enacted under Section 148 of the Motor Traffic Act. 
The relevant Authorities are responsible for the present situation in the country in failing to provide reasonable road capacity on the roads for the smooth flow of traffic. 
Therefore, the Government should withhold the proposed increase in fines until the following recommendations are fulfilled without delay by the relevant authorities. 
1)The road capacity needs immediate improvement to meet the growing transport requirement. 
2)Transportation of all light vehicles is to be restricted temporarily. 
3) Speed-limit boards now installed in an ad hoc manner are to be re installed at the demarcated kilometre spot within the built-up area and non-built-up area. 
4)Provide the public with efficient and safe transport system both by road and rail. 
5)Driver improvement Point system Regulation published in the Govt. Gazette No. 1726/12 dated 5/10/2011 should be amended and implemented. 
6)The Endorsement Form system (M. T. A 32 c Section 125 of the M. T. Act published in the Govt. Gazette No. 605/6 of 11/4/1990) is to be implemented without delay. 
7)No Parking and Parking and Standing boards erected on all roads- A, B, AB, C and provincial roads are all invalid and illegal. Authorities have failed to erect approved sign boards with panels affixed to the boards as per Govt. Gazette No. 444/18 of 13/3/1987 prior to police prosecution. 
8)For the information of the public, Radar Speed Meter Guns to be gazetted as per Govt. Gazette No. 827/13 dated 14/6/1994 along with the procedures in detecting speeding vehicles. 
9)National Thoroughfare Act No. 40 of 2008: There are serious errors and omissions in the Act and in the Expressway Regulations No. 2/2011 published in the Govt. Gazette No. 1717/4 of 03/08/2011. The entire Act and the Regulation should be repealed and a fresh Act and a Regulation should be enacted. 
10)Traffic officers are to be trained (Refresher courses) prior to being detailed for traffic duties. Strict enforcement of the law is to be observed. 
The relevant authorities could take remedial measures in the coming months to reach a reasonable target before the United Nations Resolutions for Decade of Action for Road Safety 2011-2020 concludes. 
A reasonable increase in fines for the 14 different category of vehicles may be considered, given the constraints placed on the motorists except for offences as stated on page 2 of the report. 
Points to ponder
My conclusion is that;
1. The need to increase fines for motorists would not have arisen, if the Ministry of Transport and the Department of Motor Traffic had continued with the implementation of the two Regulations  (a) Driver Improvement Points (DEMERIT POINTS) system and (b) the Endorsement Form M.T.A. 32 C. The Ministry of Transport and the Department of Motor Traffic should be held responsible for the increase in traffic accidents.
2.The Ministry of Highways and the Road Development Authority failed to increase the road capacity of Roads in relation to the 298 percent increase in the vehicle population. 
The Government too has failed to restrict the importation of vehicles to Sri Lanka in relation to the capacity of the road network in Sri Lanka. 
3.The Government and all relevant stakeholders should extend their fullest cooperation in achieving the desired results by taking remedial measures in the coming months to reach a reasonable target in view of the Decade of Action for Road Safety 2011-2020 and in compliance with the U N Resolutions on Road Safety. 
4.However, prior to the implementation of the increase in the proposed traffic fines, the Government and stakeholders should first improve the ground situation such as the road capacity for the motorists to travel smoothly. 
5. It is regrettable to note that since the Final Report was approved by Parliament on December 12, 2014, none of the stakeholders, including the Ministries, the Road Development Authority and the Department of Motor Traffic, have taken positive action to help the motorists and ensure a free flow of traffic. 
6.There are 14 categories of vehicles as at 2015 with different sizes, weights, and dimensions. They are: Motorcycles, cars, motor tricycles, buses, dual purpose (vans/cabs), motor lorries, prime movers, lorry and others, ambulances, hearses, land vehicles, NA tractors, LV tractors and lorry trailers. 
7.One should take cognizance of the fact that vehicles have different sizes, weights and dimensions that result in the occupancy of differing areas of road space. They pay different fees/charges for emission testing certificates. 
8.My personal view is that due to the disparity of vehicle sizes, capacity, dimensions etc the increase in fines should not be the same for all sizes of the 14 categories of vehicles. 
9.The previous increase in fines was gazetted by Act No. 12 of 2005. More than eleven years have lapsed. A reasonable increase in fines by 20 percent for the 14 category of vehicles may be considered given the restrictions and constraints placed on motorists on roads, preventing them from following or complying with the road rules gazetted under Section 148 of the Motor Traffic Act and other relevant Traffic laws/Regulations. 
10.The enforcement of law in such an errant manner by the Ministry of Transport is a negation of the fundamental rights to equal protection of the law guaranteed by Article 12 (1) of the Constitution.
Copies of the above reports were delivered to the following officials on March 6, 2017: 
Secretary/H.E. the President, Secretary/ Ministry of Highways, Secretary/Ministry of Transport, Secretary, Ministry of Law & Order, Secretary, Ministry of Finance, Deputy Solicitor General Yoshitha Rajakaruna, Commissioner General/Dept. of Motor Traffic, Chairman, Road Development Authority, Legal Draftsman, and Inspector General of Police. 
It was also sent to the 12 Select Committee members, who approved the above report in Parliament on December 12, 2014 and to the Country Representatives of the World Health Organisation, the Asian Development Bank, the World Bank and the chairman of the Chamber of Commerce. 

It is advisable to take appropriate action having digested the detailed report, before this matter is canvassed in a court of Law and in Parliament.

Will the secretary become the fall guy
	

There are many Ministry secretaries now unlike in the past who refuse to carry out illegal orders given by their purohitas.

Meanwhile, nowadays purohitas have made it a practice to tell the secretaries who refuse to be their yes-men to go back to the pool, they say.
A story making the rounds in political and bureaucratic circles these days says that a certain secretary despite being an obedient yes-man is about to be condemned to a term in the pool.
A purohita with close ties to the highest echelons facing much flak over an issue related to taking on rent a big building at a massive cost to the exchequer has decided to wash his hands off by putting the entire blame on the Ministry secretary, inside sources say.
So the fall guy is expected to be sentenced to a long term in the pool shortly. The usual hype about bureaucratic bungling and stern action against an errant high-up will follow, they say.
