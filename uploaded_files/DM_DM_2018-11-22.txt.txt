UNP will talk to all Opposition parties: Ranil
	
The UNP would talk to all Opposition parties and decide on a collective stance on holding elections though it was not the most important factor at the moment, UNP Leader Ranil Wickremesinghe said yesterday.
Mr Wickremesinghe expressed this sentiment while speaking to UNP Organizations at Temple Trees last afternoon.
We will decide on a stance with regard to an election after discussing the issue with all political parties. I believe that the present Parliament could go on till August 20, 2020.
However, it will not go on until such time as Presidential Election could be held before that. However, an election could be held only after installing a legal Government, Mr Wickremesinghe said.
The main issue the country is facing today is the Constitutional crisis. What we should consider is whether we are to go for a referendum to get peoples opinion on the Constitution, he added.
He said that some were talking about an election as they think they could win at the election.
The No Confidence Motion (NCM) on the Government has been duly approved and is included in the Hansard.
We all saw what took place in Parliament on Friday. The Speaker had to come with Police protection to begin sessions legally. The Supreme Court had held that sessions are legal only when the Speaker is present in the chambers with the Mace as per the verdict was given in the case Samarakody vs Attorney General in 1950s.
Those who did not have the majority in the House created havoc. They threw a Bible at one of our MPs. The MP who threw the Bible at Opposition MPs were a Catholic. They would have thrown the Dhamma Pada as well if a copy was available inside the Chambers, he also said.
Mr Wickremesinghe warned that commotion could take place when the motion to stop the expenditure head of the new Constitution is debated in the House on November 29 2019.
This procedure is being followed as per the Standing Orders as requested by the President, he said.
Mr Wickremesinghe then stressed the need for carrying out awareness programmes in the national, district and constituency level.
He advised the organizers to work with other political parties in doing so.
He is also expected to meet Provincial Council members and members of Local Government members shortly. (Yohan Perera)

US Senator urges Prez to accept results of two NCMs
	
The United States Senator Chris Van Hollen has written to President Maithripala Sirisena raising deep concerns about his decision to remove Sri Lanka's Prime Minister and the subsequent rejection of the two No-Confidence Motions (NCMs) in the Sri Lankan parliament on President's choice of replacement Mahinda Rajapaksa.
In the letter, he has urged the President to accept the results of the no-confidence motions in parliament, in accordance with the Sri Lankan constitution and the rule of law.

Vehicle prices to increase by 10 - 15 % next year: Importers
	
The prices of vehicles would increase next year by 10 to 15 percent, the Vehicle Importers Association said.
The present vehicle sales have come down by 60 percent due to unpredictable market bahaviour in the country, Vehicle Importers Association Lanka (VIAL) President Indika Sampath Merenchige said.
Speaking to the Daily Mirror due to the significant depreciation of the Sri Lankan Rupee against the US Dollar and the unstable political situation, the vehicle prices would increase in at a higher rate, he said.
We cannot make predictions but with the Rupee depreciation vehicle prices cannot be controlled by whoever comes to office, he said.
Meanwhile, the Ceylon Motor Trader Association (CMTA) President Sheran Fernando said due to the uncertainty of the budget, they were facing significant problem of how to proceed in terms of the commitments they had given to their principals.
The CMTA mainly consists of brand new vehicles, while the VIAL imports mostly reconditioned vehicles.
He said their membership with the vehicle manufacturers was facing difficulty due to the uncertainty prevalent at the present time.
Initially the 200 percent of cash deposit on Letter of Credit and the significant depreciation of the rupee caused a huge downfall of the vehicle imports, Fernando said.
VIASL Chairman Ranjan Peiris said the total vehicle sales in the country had come down by 60 percent.
People seem to be hoping the new Governments moves would bring vehicle prices, he said.
We were used to import vehicles from Japan, UK, Australia and Thailand. Depending on the exchange rate fluctuation the vehicle prices would be increased, he said. (Chaturanga Samarawickrama)

We no longer follow Westminster system: Dayasiri
	
Cabinet Spokesman and Skills Development Minister Dayasiri Jayasekara said today Sri Lanka did not follow the traditions of the British Parliament since it became a Republic in 1972 and that from 1978 onwards it was ruled under an Executive President.
He said this at the weekly Cabinet news briefing in response to a statement made by former leader of the House and Minister Lakshman Kiriella that Sri Lanka should follow the Westminster system.
Todays Parliamentary proceedings will be peaceful if the UNF-led opposition alliance does not pick a fight with the government on composition of the Select Committee to be established. The Parliamentary select committees had a majority representation during the regime of President Chandrika Kumaratunga in 1994 and during the 100-day programme in 2015, despite having the support of a lesser number of members than the opposition. Therefore, the government has already nominated seven members to the 12-member select committee. The UNPF-led alliance has no choice but to accept it. If someone intends to disrupt the proceedings in Parliament today, it will be the opposition, he said.
Rejecting media reports that tourism has experienced a downturn as a result of the current political crisis, the minister said the impasse had not affected travel and tourism.
I checked with the Tourism Promotion Bureau and its Chairman Sanath Ukwatte told me that not a single foreign travel operator cancelled tours to Sri Lanka. He also informed that a large group of Barmy Army comprising hundreds of British tourists is arriving in Sri Lanka in a couple of days to watch the third test match and to spend their winter vacation, he said.
Responding to a question raised by a journalist, the minister said President Maithripala Sirisena had never ordered the transfer of IP Nishantha de Silva to Negombo.
Media reports are false. If the police chief says the transfer order came from the Presidential Secretariat then that is also incorrect. President Sirisena never gave such an order, he said.
Replying to another question, he said the Constitutional Council was responsible for the removal of IGP Pujith Jayasundara and that the Police Commission of the President was not involved in appointing, transferring or taking disciplinary action against the IGP. (Sandun A. Jayasekera)

Wests covert push for a 'spring': SLFP
	
The ruling SLFP yesterday charged that the Western powers were in a covert move to create unrest in Sri Lanka similar to that of Arab Spring they staged in the Middle East in 2015 and the current political and Constitutional Impasse was their agenda.
General Secretary of the SLFP Prof. Rohana Lakshman Piyadasa told the media last afternoon at the party office that it was surprising and unacceptable on the part of Colombo-based diplomats to applaud and to be joyful from Speaker's Chambers, when Speaker Karu Jayasuriya announced that the No Faith Motion was carried in Parliament against the Government of Mahinda Rajapaksa on October 26.
Prof. Rohana Piyadasa told the media last afternoon at the party office that the agenda of the Sudda (Whites) was to incite a civilian unrest similar to that of Arab Spring they incited in the Middle East that brought a chain of regime changes in that region.
Though these countries were ruled by royal families or one party regime, almost all of them were peaceful, prosperous and people lived happily.
But today all these countries have been destroyed, millions have been killed and infrastructure, economy and their source of income have been totally destroyed thanks to Western powers.
The so-called International Community is waiting for Sri Lanka to do a mistake and to exploit it for their agenda. But they have no concern on the will of the Sri Lankan masses.
They should have realized the joy people expressed when Mahinda Rajapaksa was appointed as the Prime Minister by President Maithripala Sirisena on October 26. However, the Government has no intention to eject former Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe from the Temple Trees forcibly because the Diplomatic Community in Colombo is watching to grab that opportunity, Prof. Piyadasa stressed.
Prof. Piyadasa also blamed Speaker Karu Jayasuriya for the crisis and added if he acted on the advice of President Sirisena and performed parliamentary business without offending the purported government of Mahinda Rajapaksa no crisis would have arisen.
The acceptance of the No Confidence Motion from the JVP against the purported Government and PM, calling a vote for it, meeting diplomats in Parliament, Challenging the Constitutionality of Presidents action to dissolve Parliament, removing Prime Minister Wickremesinghe from his post and abrupt prorogation of Parliament were all unbecoming of a Speaker in a country where participatory democracy is upheld and decency, fair play and peaceful dialogue are honoured, he said.
Responding to a question as to why President Siriena could not call a Presidential election as agreed for by the alliance led by UNP if a Parliamentary poll were not possible, Prof. Piyadasa said demand was for a General Election.
Replying to another journalist, he said hopes of the country was that Parliament proceedings would be peaceful and be without incidents because the UNF alliance had already shown its majority with the support of 122 members, while the purported Government had only the support of 102 members and therefore, the majority of members of the Parliamentary Select Committee must come from the UNF alliance in terms of the centuries-old Parliamentary tradition, democratic principles, Parliamentary procedure and rules, fair play and decency.
Lets see on Friday. We hope we would be in a position to show the majority. Vadivel Suresh and Vasantha Senanayaka participated in todays Cabinet meeting and I hope they would rejoin us before long, Prof. Piydasa predicted.
State Minister Weerakumara Dissanayaka said all talk to protect democracy of Ranil and the UNF but no one talks about the democracy of the people who were subjected to many a hardship under the previous regime.
Why is the Sudda so concerned about Sri Lankas democracy Did not they see how the previous Government put an exorbitant tax on the people, attempted to sell national assets and jacked up prices of all essential commodities he asked.
Mr Dissanayaka criticized the TNA leader R. Sampanthan for meeting Colombo-based diplomats to discuss the ongoing political and constitutional crisis in the country and added the Tamils must embrace the SLFP to win their demands.
President Sirisena had already taken steps to release lands in the North to their owners by December 31st. (Sandun A Jayasekera)

Women and girls, fight for your rights
	
For thousands of years, one of the worlds gravest crimes or scandals has been violence or discrimination against women especially those who are not well educated and come from what are thought to be mythical low classes of society. On Sunday, November 25 the United Nations marks the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women and the world body in a statement says, violence against women and girls is one of the most widespread, persistent and devastating human rights violations today. It remains largely unreported due to the impunity, silence, stigma and shame surrounding it.
According to the UN, in general terms, this violence manifests itself in physical, sexual and psychological forms, encompassing intimate partner violence or battering, psychological abuse, marital rape, femicide, sexual violence and harassment, rape, forced sexual acts, unwanted sexual advances, child sexual abuse, forced marriage, street harassment, stalking, cyber-harassment, human trafficking, slavery, sexual exploitation, female genital mutilation and child marriage.
For instance, a 16-year-old girl was reportedly auctioned for 500 cows, three cars and ten thousand dollars on Facebook in South Sudan. The auction reportedly began on October 25 and the post was taken down by Facebook on November 9. Facebook,which reportedly has about two billion users worldwide, came under fire for being used as a medium that allowed the sale of achild bride. 
To further clarify, the Declaration on the Elimination of Violence Against Women and Girls issued by the UN General Assembly in 1993, defines violence against women as any act of gender-based violence that results in, or is likely to result in, physical, sexual or psychological harm or suffering to women, including threats of such acts, coercion or arbitrary deprivation of liberty, whether occurring in public or in private life.
In most western countries, we have seen powerful groups like the Me Too movement coming out strongly against violence or sexual harassment of women and girls though the United States President Donald Trump is not taking a tough line on this because of allegations that he also was involved in sexual harassment or violence
against women. 
The adverse psychological, sexual and reproductive health consequences of violence against women and girls affect women at all stages of their life. For example, early-set educational disadvantages not only represent the primary obstacle to universal schooling and the right to education for girls, down the line they are also to blame for restricting access to higher education and even translate into limited opportunities for women in the labour market, the UN says. 
November 25 has been designated as Orange Day by the UN Women campaign Say No, Unite launched in 2009 to mobilize civil society activists, governments and the UN system to amplify the impact of the UN Secretary-Generals campaign, Unite to End Violence against Women. Participants the world over are encouraged to wear a touch of orange in solidarity with the cause; the colour symbolizes a brighter future and a world free from violence against women and girls.
The 2018 theme is Orange the World: #HearMeToo and like previous editions, the date marks the launch of 16 days of activism that will conclude on December 10, International Human Rights Day. A host of public events are being coordinated, among which iconic buildings and landmarks will be oranged to recall the need for a violence-free future.
According to reports, in Sri Lanka, about 17 per cent of married women aged 15 to 49 have suffered from domestic violence from their intimate partner. Two per cent of married women who suffered from domestic violence, experience some form of domestic violence daily. Prevalence of domestic violence by an intimate partner increases with the age of the women. Urban residents also reported the highest percentage of domestic violence (20 per cent). Kilinochchi and Batticaloa districts have the highest level of domestic violence (50 per cent).
Married women who belong to the lowest wealth quin-tile and those with primary education reported the highest percentages in domestic violence (28 and 30 per cent respectively). Among women who suffered from domestic violence, only about one fourth or 28 per cent have sought help, three fourths or 75 per cent seek help from their family members, 27 per cent from friends or neighbours and only 18 per cent seekhelp from the police. Half of the married women age 15 to 49 or 50 per cent indicated to know about the Sri Lanka Womens Bureau to combat violence, while 26 per cent mentioned the midwife and Womens Help Line.

Agri sector revenue to be tax exempted: MR
	
The revenue generated from the agriculture sector would be exempted from income tax within this week, Prime Minister and Finance Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa said today.
He said it was necessary to develop the agriculture sector though some people were allergic to the development of the sector.
I do not know whether the previous government had any knowledge about the agriculture. Foreign countries instructed it not to focus on agriculture. Hence, they started collecting taxes from the agriculture sector. We're changing it now, he said at an event at Beliatta.
The Prime Minister said the best way to solve the current crisis in the country is to come forward and find the choice of the people.
I think we all should work according to the Constitution. All people in this country are saying that the best way to solve the crisis is to go before the people and find their choice. We have placed our faith in the people all the time. The government and the opposition only need to face the election without fear or hiding. No one will lose their civil or fundamental rights by facing an election, he said. (Aneesha Manage)

Appoint PSC to ensure Pment functions: Dullas
	
The House will be unable to function any further if the Parliament Select Committee (PSC) is not appointed tomorrow, MP Dullas Alahapperuma said.
Addressing a news briefing, he said Speaker Karu Jayasuriya had been delaying the appointment of PSC members since November 14 and that he always preferred a majority of the PSC to be UNP MPs.
The tradition is to appoint a majority of government MPs to the PSC. Hence, the Speaker cannot violate this practice. This should have been done on November 14 when the Parliament first met. However, the Speaker sabotaged the entire procedure in Parliament, he said.
He said seven MPs -- Dinesh Gunawardena, S.B. Dissanayake, Nimal Siripala de Silva, Mahinda Samarasinghe, Wimal Weerawansa, Udaya Gammanpila and Thilanga Sumathipala -- were nominated to the PSC by the government on Wednesday.
Meanwhile, Social Welfare Minister Wimal Weerawansa said some valuable properties in Temple Trees had reportedly gone missing.(Sheain Fernandopulle)

Bhutanese twins miracle separation
	

15-month-old conjoined twins Nima and Dawa Peldon have been separated in an intense 6-hour operation at Melbournes Royal Childrens Hospital. The team, led by lead Paediatric surgeon Dr Joe Crameri, consisted of up to twenty-five different medical professionals over the course of the operation including surgeons, anaesthetists and nurses.
According to the University of Maryland, the chances of giving birth to conjoined twins is about 1 in every 200,000 births and out of those, at least 70% are female and are always identical. Unfortunately, there are also high mortality rates at birth for conjoined twins and if they do survive, separation is always a risky process.
Nima and Dewa were connected at the torso which is common with conjoined twins and while doctors knew the girls shared a liver, they were unsure of what the status was with other organs such as the bowel. We didnt find any surprises Dr Crameria said post-surgery. We knew the liver would be connected, we divided that successfully  the main challenge was getting the abdomen reconstructed.
While the surgery was being undertaken, the twins mother Bhumchu Zangmo visited the local Buddhist Temple to pray with members of the local Bhutanese community who came out to support her. After being advised the surgery was a success, Bhumchu went to see her babies but at the sight of them laying in separate beds, she had to ask nursing staff which twin was which as she was unable to tell them apart. The babies also didnt like being separated and while they are recovering quickly, they prefer to be kept close together so they are able to intertwine their legs and comfort each other.
This miracle operation was made possible by Australian charity the Children First Foundation who became aware of the twins situation after their paediatrician in Bhutan, Dr Karma Sherub, asked for advice from Australian doctors. Until now, conjoined twins had never been seen in Bhutan before. Dr. Sherub was also able to accompany the family out to Australia, acting as translator, as well as being able to observe the operation and gain valuable experience with conjoined twins.
While the Children First Foundations generous supporters have covered the familys airfares, accommodation and other expenses such as rehabilitation, the Australian Government has kindly announced that it will cover the AUD350,000 cost for the operation.
Eager to return home to Bhutan, Bhumchu has been overwhelmed by the support from the Australian public, especially from the school children who wrote letters of encouragement to the twins ahead of their surgery. I am so happy that so many people have good feelings and prayers for my twins surgery. Bhumchu said through a translator. I will take all these letters to Bhutan and when the girls grow up and are able to read, I will ask them to read them all.

Brawl in parliament; Lawmakers turned lawbreakers
	
As a mother and grandmother, I wholeheartedly condemn the behaviour of the parliamentarians responsible for the thuggery witnessed in Parliament recently. I am at the end of my life, but I shudder in dread for my children and grandchildren if this is how the representatives of the people behave. This was undoubtedly the very worst example of unruly conduct, in the annals of our parliamentary history. Those who threw books across the floor, chilly water and broke chairs were the worst offenders. This is government property, was this the right way to behave, but quite obviously those who behaved as they did not know or choose to know the difference between right and wrong. It is useless for them to deny their involvement as it has all been recorded on camera, which has done the rounds to make all citizens aware of how these MPs behave. I hope those who voted for them see this and never vote for them ever again.
Shocked to see some Christian MPs involved in this kind of violent uncontrollable behaviour
	Those who misbehaved could not identify what was right and what was wrong
	Ranil Wickremesinghe, perhaps the only gentleman left among Leaders who remains calm and controlled through any crisis
	It is the democracy that is at stake during the present crisis, caused by a constitutional coup
To throw a Bible is sacrilege, this has been denied by some, but if it was any book at all it is an insult, as one is throwing away knowledge, which to us who value the knowledge we have gained from reading is an unforgivable offence. As a Christian, brought up on Christian values and principles, I was shocked to see some Christian MPs involved in this kind of violent uncontrollable behaviour. As one who was married to a Buddhist, I had learned from him of the compassion, tolerance and respect one must have for others, particularly for older people.
It is useless for them to deny their involvement as it has all been recorded on camera, which has done the rounds to make all citizens aware of how these MPs behave. I hope those who voted for them see this and never vote for them ever again

How could they possibly treat Speaker Karu Jayasuriya as they did Didnt their parents and teachers bring them up to have respect for older people For those MPs who try to deny that it wasnt chilly powder. I would say this, they have absolutely no credibility as they are known to be economical with the truth and known for their slander. This MP insulted the former President Chandrika Kumaratunge in the worst possible foul language during the last Presidential campaign. This kind of language should not be used against any woman, let alone a former President under whom he once served.
No woman should ever vote for him. I fail to comprehend how and why he was ever made a Minister after the Presidential election after losing his seat. He has no right to be there at all. Furthermore it was wrong to throw anything at all. Another senior politician Gamini Jayewickreme Perera was also attacked. What would have happened if either of the two victims or both of them had heart attacks as a result. Is this the smiling, compassionate Sri Lanka that we have been famed as and got back due to the efforts of Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe after losing this and the friendship of all democracies in the world due to the atrocities of the former regime.
To throw a Bible is sacrilege, this has been denied by some, but if it was any book at all it is an insult, as one is throwing away knowledge, which to us who value the knowledge we have gained from reading is an unforgivable offence
I am proud of the UNF MPs as a group, the TNA and the JVP who respected the dignity of this most august assembly, the Parliament of Sri Lanka by remaining calm and controlled in spite of the provocation. I am aware that Ranil Wickremesinghe spoke to UNP MPs the night before and asked them not to get provoked, Im sure the TNA and JVP leaders did this too. But I was certainly surprised to see MR, who is supposed to be a strong leader watching in silence with his son and heir by his side, making absolutely no attempt to stop the unruly, disgusting behaviour of his MPs. Dont they realize what they have done to the country, hotels have had cancellations, soon after we were called the top destination by Lonely Planet, GSP withdrawn, some countries have stopped aid, and our country has become a pariah state once again.
We live today in a world which is global. A country like ours depends on foreign aid,we cannot exist on our own. One has to respect the norms of democracy and freedom which we all fought hard for and won against heavy odds in 2015. Gone are the days when the House of Parliament had gentlemen as politicians, whichever side of the political divide that they represented. Arguments there must have been and were, but they were all conducted in a gentlemanly fashion , not with the use of violence, disrespect and the use of brawn against brains. I was not surprised to be shown the exam results of some of the worst offenders. They had failed in all subjects at the O/Levels. The UNP on the contrary, has a majority of well educated, qualified MPs who believe in the use of words, rather than fisticuffs to prove their point.
A country like ours depends on foreign aid,we cannot exist on our own. One has to respect the norms of democracy and freedom which we all fought hard for and won against heavy odds in 2015
For this we have to thank the leadership of Ranil Wickremesinghe, perhaps the only gentleman left among Leaders who remains calm and controlled through any crisis, and believes firmly as he has done throughout his political life in freedom and democracy and the rule of law. It will be the sad end of an era when he retires. It was I think the late President Jayewardene who once stated that whether it is cricket, politics or any game at all, one must abide by rules. It is democracy that is at stake in the present crisis, caused by a constitutional coup and this is what each of us has to fight to protect, for the sake of our country and the future of our youth. We must continue to pray fervently through night and day, as it is only God who can save us from this man created disaster. We certainly need a miracle which only God can give us.

Bruno Mars Thanksgiving magic for 24,000 people
	

Pint sized popstar Bruno Mars finished off his recent 24K Magic World Tour in his home state of Hawaii by donating 24,000 thanksgiving meals to those in need. The Salvation Army - Hawaiian & Pacific Islands Division has been running the programme for the past 48 years and was delighted that Mars was able to get involved this year. We are humbled and honoured by this generous donation from Hawaiis own Bruno Mars, Salvation Army Major Jeff Martin said in a statement. Bruno is a shining example of how people in Hawaii step forward and take care of one another and we are grateful to him for his aloha and kokua.
Aloha, as well as meaning hello and goodbye, can also mean love or compassion. Kokua is a cultural word and concept that is a way of relating to others that is characterized by kindness and a desire to be of help.
While the content of many of Bruno Mars songs focuses heavily on his massive amounts of wealth and his rock star lifestyle, its real magic to see the talented singer helping the people of his birthplace celebrate the Thanksgiving holiday.

Essence of life through Obata Nowe Batiththanta
	
Book Review
Do we need any foreward when we all cry over the farewells in life, Sanjeewa Moonamalpe captures the reader with these lines as the foreward of his poetry collection Obata Nowe Batiththanta (Not for you, for Chaffinches). Going along with the philosophy of Jean-Paul Charles Aymard Sartre he brings out existentialism throughout his poetry. All throughout the collection the concept of nothingness is felt. The very first poem Rasawaththu Sallalayoo Wooha (Those who enjoyed turned into wanderers) focuses on how alcohol and weed has seeped in to the lives of those who are drenched in tears of heartbreak and the suffering of life. Those who suffer will always suffer through and the struggle will never be ending. 
In a rich mans war, how the lives of others are exploited by the forces of war, poverty and depression is conveyed through the poem Maragena Marena Sahodariyakata (Suicide bomber who is a sister). This touches the life of Thamilini Jeyakumaran who was once a LTTE terrorist. A paragraph from her autobiography runs throughout the poem bringing forth the needlessness of war. How the rich mans war being fought by the youth of a nation, divided and lost. The end lines of the poem touch the readers human emotions in a scale unexpected. The understanding that the reader and the terrorist are one and the same, humans at the base level and oppressed by the dominators of a society. The understanding between the writer and the terrorist goes beyond the traditional borders of understanding into the landscape of loss and humanity.
James Ayya (Brother James) comes into the landscape of poetry through his life and philosophy. The theme Nothingness again runs throughout the poem. This time though it highlights the bare essential needs of a human fulfilled in a daily manner personifying the general public of a nation. Living for their daily bread, fulfilling the dreams of their children and family while their own dreams fade away into the horizon.
With that the writer moves further into the world of passionate desires in the poem Hangum Pipireemak, (Bursting of Emotions) and expresses the longing over desires once fulfilled and love long lost. Sanjeewa Moonamalpe puts the last touches for his poetry collection through the poem Boho Kalakata Pasu (After a long time) with the nostalgic feelings over the concept of time.
In loneliness memories awaken with the human emotions felt long time ago, loneliness is a nostalgic lover tormenting a broken heart. This is symbolized through the empty sky without the moon or the stars. Again, highlighting the concept of nothingness throughout the human life in the poem Gewunu Digu Siwu Raya (Long nights gone).
Existentialism is brought forth deeply in the poem Warella math ekkama windawanna (Come suffer with me). In a world where moon light is admired for its beauty, chirping of birds as music, the writer sees otherwise. Writer sees the dullness in moonlight and the wailing of the birds bringing forth the wailing of the human soul suffering throughout a lifetime. Wind is felt as a repulsive feeling enhancing the emptiness of life. This emptiness and dullness the writer feels, runs throughout the poem highlighting the nothingness in life.
A brothers love is as deep as a fathers love. Loku Ayyata (For elder brother) poem paints the love of an elder brother in the minds of the reader.
Letting go of his own dreams, as an elder brother he builds the dreams of his siblings and even at the last moment of his life how he lets go of his last breath in the same manner embracing life with the understanding that another journey begins with death. All throughout this poetry collection this philosophy towards life is emphasized. 
Bindu Mihirathi Mathaka Kabilith (Sweet memories broken), touches on the memories in the inner conscious recalled by the present. According to the writer nothingness prevails everywhere in life so everything which calls for these memories are gone. And the memories itself are hidden in the deep corners of ones heart. Wailing for a love long lost and gone is recalled by the memories and the narrator is tormented by this. The poem ends with the question where the narrator addresses the person he loved, if she also recalls the same memories with the presence of today. 
Ee Wiyali Bo Patha ( That dried Bo leaf), takes us on a journey where we also used to press Bo Tree leaves within the pages of our books. The narrator uses this nostalgic remembrance of a Bo tree leaf to recall the memories of a love long lost gone.
Again, the concept of nothingness is beautifully crafted throughout this poem. The symbols and metaphors go along with the line of the concept of nothingness.
Just like a name written on a Bo tree leaf forever craved in the heart, life melting away like a cube of ice on hand, separation from the person the narrator loved and the name also fading away like dust, are beautiful symbols of a love past gone.
The peak of the poem is at the moment when the narrator accidentaly meets the person he loved, on the streets going for work. Shock waves of remembrances are passing through him and the only thing he feels is the unbearable loneliness. And just like the name carved on the Bo tree leaf the same name is carved on the walls of his heart never letting go of him in emotions and memory. 
Boho Kalakata Pasu Rambukkana Dumriya Nawathumedi (After a long time at the Rambukkana Train Station) is where the narrator observes the person, he loved looking at him expectantly. The reader realizes this only at the end of the poem. The fruitfulness and the uselessness of these expectations of love are conveyed through the stanzas before the end of the poem. Again, the writer uses symbolism to convey this message.
Isaw (Locations), is another one of the writers exquisite craftsmanship impacting our imagination. 
The narrator meets the person he loved on streets filled with dust and recalls how they used to share a lunch packet sitting in an area filled with trees, fallen dry leaves and love. Just like the fallen dry leaves this love also faded away. Which is like a foretelling of the future within the presence. With the sudden meeting on the streets, the narrator is struck by the lightning of the eyes he once knew, eyes he once so endearingly loved. Yet again they part ways like the dust in the wind. 
Boho Kalakata Pasu Rambukkana Dumriya Nawathumedi (After a long time at the Rambukkana Railway Station) is where the narrator observes the person, he loved looking at him expectantly. The reader realizes this only at the end of the poem. The fruitfulness and the uselessness of these expectations of love are conveyed through the stanzas before the end of the poem. Again, the writer uses symbolism to convey this message. Dew drops giving up on their lives and kissing the earth, river with its ripples loving the fish in the water and the lake embracing the lake flowers with tender warm love are these contradictions between love lost and love expectant. 
Sanjeewa Moonamalpe
In the poem Obata Nowe Batiththanta (Not for you, for the Chaffinches), the narrator conveys his longing to be free as a bird traveling into the vast horizon of the sky letting going of all the norms in life.
With that the writer moves further into the world of passionate desires in the poem Hangum Pipireemak, (Bursting of Emotions) and expresses the longing over desires once fulfilled and love long lost. Sanjeewa Moonamalpe puts the last touches for his collection of poems through the poem Boho Kalakata Pasu (After a long time) with the nostalgic feelings over the concept of time. The narrator paints a landscape where time is of no essence at all. Even though time might be of use for a waterfall, rain, wind and the coldness that changes with time, for the narrator it is of no significance at all.
The concept of nothingness running throughout the collection of poems, the writer brings in the last poem as the essence of the whole collection of poems. The narrator is at a standstill point in life and wishes for the memories to burn away and in the end asks of time to let go of him as he no longer wishes to run with time. Sanjeewa Moonamalpe has done justification for the meaning and essence of life.

False allegations made by Govt. MPs against Speaker: Navin
	
UNP National Organizer Navin Dissanayake yesterday charged that false allegations were being made by the Government MPs against him saying he was unduly influencing Speaker Karu Jayasuriya to make certain decisions.
Mr Dissanayake, who is the son-in-law of Speaker Jayasuriya, told a media briefing that no Member of Parliament could influence the Speaker.
My politics and the politics of the Speaker are different. You may recall that Mr Jayasuriya joined the Government of Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa and then came back to UNP but I did not follow him during that time, Mr Dissanayake said.
They say I am getting Mr Jayasuriya to promote me as the next leader of UNP but this is totally false, he added.
Also, he said that he had informed the Mahanayake Theras that the common candidate, who they were going to field at the next Presidential Election, would be from the UNP. (Yohan Perera)

Follow UK House of Commons when Constitution unclear: Kiriella
	
Coming up with a fresh argument on what should be done to resolve the present political crisis, the United National Party (UNP) yesterday said Sri Lankan Parliament was bound to follow the tradition of House of Commons of the UK when the Sri Lankan Constitution is unclear about certain situations.
This was expressed by UNP MP Lakshman Kiriella at a media briefing last morning.
Mr Kiriella said the House was bound to follow Section 7 of Parliament Powers and Privileges Act where it said the House was bound to follow the tradition of the House of Commons when the local constitution was unclear on certain situations.
Parliament and members thereof shall hold, enjoy and exercise, in addition to the privileges, immunities and powers conferred by this Act, such and like immunities as are for the time being held, enjoyed and exercised by the Commons House of Parliament of United Kingdom, the MP said reading out Section 7 of Parliament Powers and Privileges Act.
Accordingly, he said the tradition followed by the House of Commons when it comes to the appointment of a Prime Minister was that the person who held the majority was given the post.
Therefore he said President Maithripala Sirisena should appoint the person who commanded a majority in the House as the Prime Minister.
He said Secretaries to Ministries ceased to hold office upon a dissolution if the Cabinet under the Provisions of the Constitution or upon a determination by the President under the Article 43 or 44 which results in the Ministry ceasing to exist.
Mr Kiriella, therefore, said a Cabinet does not exist at the moment Speaker announced that it does not exist with the approval of the No Confidence Motion against the present regime.
In such circumstances Secretaries cannot carry out any function at the moment, he said.
Referring to the request that had been made by the venerable Mahanayakes to set up a Caretaker Government under newly appointed Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa and UNP Leader Ranil Wickremesinghe could not be fulfilled as there were no provisions for such a Government in the Constitution.
UNP MP Harshana Rajakaruna who also participated at the briefing said the Mahanayake Theras had expressed their displeasure over the present political crisis.
He said they expressed their displeasure when the UNP delegation met them on Tuesday. (Yohan Perera)

Govt. can repay loans for 2019: Fin. Ministry
	
Rejecting media reports that the government was unable to repay loans next year, the Finance Ministry said loans would be serviced and repaid during the 2019 financial year.
Issuing a statement, the Ministry said:
The Government of Sri Lanka (GOSL) has raised loans in terms of the provisions of the specific laws including the Registered Stock and Securities Ordinance, No. 7 of 1937, Local Treasury Bills Ordinance, No. 8 of 1923 and the Foreign Loans Act, No. 29 of 1957. As such, any dues on such loans that may arise, in accordance with the respective terms and conditions attributed to such borrowings, can validly be charged on the Consolidated Fund as provided for, in the Constitution of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka and such specific laws as noted.
Therefore, the GOSL wishes to assure all lenders that all such dues will be met on the due dates as has been the time honoured tradition of the country where we have maintained an unblemished track record of debt payments.
Further, we wish to note that this Ministry has been closely collaborating with the Central Bank of Sri Lanka to ensure that adequate buffers are created and maintained in view of the dues that will arise in 2019 especially the repayment of the International Sovereign Bond (ISB) amounting to USD1,500 million maturing during the year 2019.

His clandestine love affair revealed in unexpected manner
	
Two brothers, aged 43 and 46, who allegedly robbed a man of Rs. 1800 after throwing chillie powder in his face were taken into custody by the Nawalapitiya Police.
The victim of this attack, a 67-year-old man, who had gone to a funeral house in the Thispane area in Nawalapitiya and was returning home, had been waylaid by the two brother who were drunk at the time. They had taken their prey to the home of the illegitimate wife of one of them and stolen his money after throwing chillie powder in his face.
The upshot of this was that while the two were busy ridding the elderly man of his money the husband of the woman who was being 'kept' by one of the brothers had also been at home and the clandestine love affair of his wife came out into the open as a result of the brothers' decision to bring their victim to this house.

Il Full Moon Poya day The day Buddha sent His first missionaries
	
The time for offering of Katina Cheevera - thick robes for the rainy season to Buddhist priests who observed Vas or the rainy season sojourn ends on Il full moon poya day. Thus a series of meritorious activities connected with Vas and Cheevera puja also comes to an end. However, Il full moon poya day is of special significance to Buddhists due to numerous other religious events taken place on this day and during the month of Il. Sending missionaries for the first time for the propagation of Buddhism, conversion of three Kassapa brothers, Devarohanaya or descending from the celestial world, and the attainment of Arahant Sariputtas parinibbana are the significant events that had taken place on this full moon poya day and during the month of Il. Apart from these it was on this full moon poya day that Gautama Buddha gave the positive assurance or explanation to Maithri Bodhisattva of becoming a Buddha. 
A period full of religious activities comes to an end
The previous month had been a very busy month for Buddhist priests who had to participate in Katina pinkama ceremonies. They had to attend to pirith chanting ceremonies, Katina cheevara ceremonies in other temples and Katina perahera ceremonies in addition to organizing religious events in their own temples. Minds of laymen are also full of faith and piety having offered Katina cheevara and having participated in religious events in addition to listening to Dhamma. 
The positive assurance or explanation to Maithri Bodhisattva of becoming a Buddha
Maithri Bodhisattva who had completed the performance of Buddhist Ordinances as a prerequisite of becoming a Buddha i.e. Paramita during a period of Solos Assankeyya Kalpa Lakshaya was a celestial being. He had departed from heaven during Gautama Buddhas period and was born in Sankassa pura about 48 miles away from Shravasthi - Sewath Nuwara as the son of a rich nobleman named Siriwardhana. 
He completed his studies under the great teacher Disapamok and inherited quite a lot of wealth from his parents. He had a large number of followers. He had the occasion to see Devarohanaya Maha puja and listen to the discourse between the Buddha and Arahant Sariputta. He was delighted and entered into priesthood under Buddha with his following numbering about one hundred. He attained the higher ordination, learnt the Dharma and taught the others. This thera observed vas and received a couple of valuable Katina cheevara. He knew the efficacy or the effect of Katina cheewara puja and offered both to the Buddha. With one of them he made a canopy for Buddhas fragrant house - Gandha Kutiya. He tore the other robe into strips and hung it at the edges of the canopy. Buddha explained the merits of offering cheewara and gave Niyatha Vivarana  permission to or assurance of becoming a Buddha. 
Buddha told the followers that Maithri Bodhisattva would be born as the son of Sakwithi Raja universal king Sanka in the Kethumathi kingdom during this Maha Badra Kalpa. Brahmani Badrawathi will be his mother. Banyan -Nuga tree will be his Bodhiya. 
Maithri Bodhisattva worshipped the Buddha and accepted the Niyatha Vivaranaya. This happened on an Il full moon poya day such as this. 
Sending Missionaries
By the first Il full moon poya day, after Buddhas Enlightenment there were 61 Arahants including the Buddha Himself. There were the five Brahmin ascetics, Kondanna, Bhaddya, Vappa, Mahanama and Assaji. Kondanna was the youngest of the eight Brahmins who were invited for prince Siddharthas naming ceremony. He foretold that prince Siddhartha would certainly become the Buddha. Together with Bhaddhya, Vappa, Mahanama and Assaji who were the sons of four other Brahmins retired to the forest in anticipation of prince Siddharthas renunciation. They attended to ascetic Siddhartha when he was striving to attain Buddhahood. After the enlightenment, Buddha expounded Dhamma Chakka Pavattana sutta and they attained Arahantship. Kondanna was the first to realize the four Noble Truths and the eightfold path to Nibbana, He was followed by the other four. 
Conversion of Yasa and his followers
Next to be converted was Yasa, son of a millionaire in Benares who met Buddha while going away from home after realizing the vanities of worldly life. When Buddha expounded Dhamma Yasa, attained Arahantship. Venerable Yasas father came across the Buddha while going in search of his missing son and became the first lay disciple to take refuge in the Triple Gem, Buddha, Dhamma and Sangha. Venerable Yasas mother and his former wife were the two female lay disciples of the Buddha, Dhamma and Sangha. Venerable Yasa had fifty four friends. Having heard of Venerable Yasas conversion they too entered the Order and attained Arahantship. 
Sixty Arahants to propagate Buddhism for the good and well being of humanity
Thus by the first Il Full Moon Poya day after the Enlightenment of the Exalted One there were sixty Arahants excluding the Buddha Himself. Buddha dispatched them in various directions to propagate the sublime Dhamma. Caratha Bikkhawe Carikan, bahu jana Hitaya, Bahujana Sukhaya Buddha requested the first sixty Arahants to go forth for the good and happiness of the many, out of compassion for the world, for the good, benefit and happiness of gods and men and to preach Dhamma which is excellent in the beginning, in the middle and at the end . He told them that no two should go in a single direction so that they could be of assistance to as many as possible. 
He said that there were some who had lust in them but there were many who could understand Dhamma. With this exhortation Buddha dispatched His first sixty disciples to various directions and He Himself went to Uruwela in Senaigama. 
It is better to seek oneself rather than to seek a missing woman
On His way to Uruwela Buddha met thirty young men. Twenty nine of them were with their wives. They had gone to a grove for amusement. The thirtieth prince who was a bachelor had taken a courtesan and that woman had fled away with the valuables of the others. When the princes were going in search of that woman they met Buddha and He explained to them that it was better to seek oneself rather than to seek a missing woman. They realized the truth and entered the Order and received the Higher Ordination. 
Ordination of Jatila brothers
Buddha proceeded to Uruwela to be of service to the Jatila brothers who lived in Aramayas along the river Neranjana. The eldest Uruwela Kassapa who was very proud and arrogant lived in the upper part of the river with five hundred followers. Nadi Kassapa who had three hundred followers lived in the middle part of the river and the youngest, Gaya Kassapa lived in the lowest part of the river basin with two hundred followers. 
Buddha first went to Uruwela Kassapas aramaya and subjugated him by displaying three thousand and sixteen miracles. Uruwela Kassapa who realized the truth entered the priesthood with his followers. Their crowns of matted hair were thrown into the river. Nadi Kassapa who saw his elder brothers matted hair floating in the river rushed to his Aramaya to ascertain what had happened to his elder brother and followers. When he went there with his followers Buddha preached Dharma and all of them entered the priesthood. Gaya Kassapa and his followers too entered the priesthood in the same manner. 
Additta Pariyaya sutta- All inflames
Kassapa brothers and their followers had developed their own spiritual attainments and they could understand Buddhas doctrine without much difficulty. Buddha accompanied them to Gayasisa and preached the Aditta Pariyaya sutta - all in flames hearing which all of them attained Arahantship. 
Buddhas visit to King Bimbisara at Rajagaha Nuwara
In keeping with a promise made to King Bimbisara, Buddha proceeded to Rajagaha Nuwara accompanied by one hundred and three Arahants including Uruwela Kassapa, Nadi Kassapa and Gaya Kassapa. King Bimbisara went with a large following to receive the Buddha and pay respects to Him. It was a difficult task for King Bimbisara to realize whether Buddha was a disciple of Arahant Kassapa or Arahant Kassapa was a disciple of the Buddha. It so happened because Arahant Kassapa was held with high esteem as an ascetic. 
After reading the kings thoughts Buddha questioned fire worship. In order to clear the Kings doubt Arahant Kassapa explained why he had given up fire worship and said that Buddha was a Unique One and his teacher and that he was His disciple. 
Offering of Veluwanaramaya - the Bamboo grove
The king and the people were happy about the clarification. In order to indicate that Buddha and Uruwela Kassapa were similarly converted in previous births too Buddha preached Maha Narada Kassapa Jatakaya. Having understood the Dhamma King Bimbisara attained Sowan, the first of the four paths to Nirvana. He invited Buddha and His followers to his palace for Dana and after offering Dana he also offered the Bamboo Grove - Veluwanaramaya for the use of the Buddha and His disciples. 
Attainment of Arahant Sariputtas Parinibbana
It was on a subsequent Il full moon poya day that Dharma Senadhipathi and one of the Buddhas chief disciples, Arahant Sariputta attained Parinibbana. 
Arahant Sariputtas assistance to his mother
His mother, Rupasari did not believe in the threefold refuge and remained heretic even in her old age. Arahant Sariputta contemplated as to whether she possessed the virtues of attaining Nibbana by the cessation of all desires and of re-existence realized that she could attain Sowan, the first of the four paths to Nibbana. Hence after obtaining permission from the Buddha to attain Parinibbana Arahant Sariputta made an opportune visit to his mother followed by hundreds of thousands of weeping people who had heard about the Maha Theras Parinibbana. Maha Thera preached to his mother the virtuous properties of the Buddha such as the moral conduct, intelligence, sense of liberation knowledge of emancipation, and meditation vision and philosophy and loving kindness to convince her that Buddha was a peerless teacher and the Unique One. 
After listening to her son patiently Brahmani Rupasari gave up her beliefs in heathenism and attained Sovan. Arahant Sariputta Maha Thera was happy that he could re-pay his mother for bringing him up. 
After being of service to many including his own mother Arahant Sarikaputra Maha Thera attained Parinibbana on an Il Full Moon Poya Day.

Ill Poya Reflections The art of living the Dhamma
	
Dhamma is a very simple procedure, which is taking place everywhere and every moment in every being, which anybody can comprehend as soon as it is uncovered of the veil of mystery in which it was encircled by the attitude, thinking and way of life.  Engels: [InDialectics of Nature]
For example, Buddhism de-emphasises individualism by highlighting anatta (no self) and anicca (impermanence) as two of the three symbols of existence. All beings are a mere combination of the ever-changing aggregates. Thus, a Buddhist cannot concede individuality because concepts like I, me, mine and you, yours are only illusions of such composites, which erroneously encourage us to consider that people are independent, static beings. We use these provisions only as a matter of convenience in as much as verbal communication does not have the capacity to describe a persistently changing being.
Ill and Katina
The Katina Cheevara is brought to their respective temples in processions and offered to the resident Upasampada monks, who observed Vas [rainy retreat] for nearly three months. The offering of Katina Cheevaraya is considered as a highly meritorious act, which takes place in most of the Temples during the month of Ill. Another among other significant things that had happened on the Ill full moon Day and recorded in the Buddha scripts has been that a deputation of 60 Arhants were launched from Dhamma preaching to a huge crowd of people.
On the other hand, if you learn the art of Dharma, you start understanding peace and concord within yourself. Keep your mind pure and full of love

Oh! Bhikkhus for the Welfare of the many, for the Happiness of the many, through Compassion to the World, Go Ye Forth, and spread the Doctrine of Buddha Dhamma for the benefit of Devas and Human Beings. In this manner, the first Buddhist Missionaries commenced their journey on Ill Poya day in various directions.
Similarities
Alexander Berzin, scholar, author and teacher of Tibetan Buddhism, writing in his web speaks of similarities between Buddhism and Islam.
The Kalachakra is a term used in Vajrayana Buddhism meaning wheel of time or time-cycles. It is a tantric teaching in Tibetan Buddhism.
It circles around the concept of time and cycles from the cycles of the planets, to the cycles of human inhalation, it educates the practice of working with the most delicate energies within ones body on the path to illumination.
Another interpretation of Kalachakras forecast is that it refers to internal war against mental and exciting aggression, that it largely refers to the inner battle of the religious practitioner against barbarian tendencies.
Berzin says, the Kalachakra presentation of the mythical Shambhala war and the Islamic discussion of jihad show remarkable similarities. Both Buddhist and Islamic holy wars are defensive tactics for stopping attacks by external hostile forces, and never offensive campaigns for winning converts. Both have internal spiritual levels of meaning, in which the battle is against negative thoughts and destructive emotions. Both need to be waged founded on ethical principles, not on the basis of unfairness and hatred. The Kalachakra literature in fact refers to the concept of jihad in the prasangika manner of taking it to its rational extreme to demonstrate a position to avoid.
According to Berzins studies, many leaders have distorted and oppressed the concept of jihad for power and gain. The same has happened with Shambhala and its argument of war against destructive alien forces. Just as opponents of Buddhism could focus on abuses of Kalachakras peripheral level of religious battle and dismiss the internal level, and this would be unfair to Buddhism as a whole; the same is true regarding anti-Muslim critics of jihad. The recommendations in the Buddhist tantras regarding the holy teacher may be useful here. Almost every religious teacher has a mixture of good character and faults. Although a follower must not deny the harmful qualities of a teacher, to dwell on them will only cause anger and despair. If, in its place, a disciple focuses on a teachers positive qualities, he will gain insight to follow the spiritual path.
The same can be spoken about the Buddhist and Islamic wisdom regarding holy wars. Both religions have seen abuses of its calls for an external battle when vicious forces threaten spiritual practice. Without refuting or dwelling on these abuses, one can achieve inspiration by focusing on the payback of waging an inner holy war in either faith. In both religions, the main importance is on the internal spiritual battle against ones own unawareness and destructive ways. The caliph was demonstrating his influence to rule the entire Islamic world after conquering his brother in a civil war. He did not force all the Buddhists of Kabul to convert, nor did he destroy the monasteries.Refer: Berzin ArchivesWebsite:November 2001
Dhamma
What ones mind holds, at a given moment, is Dhamma.One has to begin to understand the Dharma through realisation. It is free from all sectarian dogmas, beliefs, rites and rituals. Even sectarian names are not needed. You may or may not call yourself a Sinhalese, Tamil or a Muslim, but you should be a Dharmic being, a person existing with a life of Dharma. This means that you should remain pure. If your mind remains uncontaminated, then all your other dealings, vocal or physical, will obviously become pure.
Another interpretation of Kalachakras forecast is that it refers to internal war against mental and exciting aggression, that it largely refers to the inner battle of the religious practitioner against barbarian tendencies
On the other hand, if you learn the art of Dharma, you start understanding peace and concord within yourself. Keep your mind pure, full of love and concern; the tranquility and harmony that is generated within infuse the mood around you. Anyone who gets in touch with you at that time establishes experiencing peace and concord. You are doling out something good that you have. This is Dharma, the art of living.
The practice
We desire to discover for ourselves, with certainty and ask the question what is the purpose of life To find the answer to this we must be rid of all dogmas, religions, philosophies, creeds, races, nationalities and rites, because we cannot discover our purpose in life with all these hindrances.
So long as there are restrictions, there is grief and it is from sadness that all men would escape. They are trying to find a way out of anguish, out of their entanglement in the wheel of sorrow and pain. In the attainment of excellence is Liberation to be found...grief and joy, pain and happiness, light and shade are the same thing. True conception is the outcome of concord which is perfection, the fragile poise of reason and of life...Have no fear of life and you will have no fear of death. The world is in an awful state where the men are caught in many a social and environmental influences which narrow their intellect and therefore limit their viewpoint and their contentment.
To find out for oneself what is right, all influence must end.
Surely, perception ought to take the place of our abstract thinking. The unconditioned mind can be associated with insightful mind. Life is not so very easy and the persons must have the strength and the ability not to be caught in the influence of unevenness. To find out for oneself what is right, all influence must end. There is no good conditioning or bad conditioning; there is only liberty from all conditioning. There are all kinds of things in life. Life is like the deep sea, which is tremendously deep, having vast currents and is teeming with all kinds of life. And self-determination from the very structure of thought is to be a light to one. To know yourself you need not read a book, go to a priest, to any psychologist.
The whole wealth is within yourself. In this light all action takes place. There is no how, no arrangement, and no practice. There is only the seeing which is the doing. One has to see, not through the eyes of a different person. As a mirror reflects all things held facing it, so when ones mind-mirror is quiet, one will be able to see a replicate in it the true quality of oneself and of the other ones mind can discover what is true only when it is liberated from all conditioning, not when it merely repeats certain words or quotes the books called scriptures. Such a mind is not free. It is only the free mind that can be imaginative and it can be creative only when it is open, free from conditioning like the following of a pattern, a principle, or a tradition set up by an organized religion. It is only the free mind that can find out or perceive the truth of something. One has to discover it every instant of the day as one is living.
Life is like the deep sea, which is tremendously deep, having vast currents and is teeming with all kinds of life. And self-determination from the very structure of thought is to be a light to one.
Sariputtha Thera
Among other significant events of Ill; Jatila monks Uruwela Kassapa, Nadie Kassapa and Gaya Kassapa who followed a different religion and living in Neranjala village, after listening to Buddhas preaching understood the dhamma. Saripuththa thera told Buddha that he was weak and feeble and he would not be able to return after seeing his mother at his native place and he would attain Parinirwana there. Thus Saripuththa started his sojourn to see his mother. He lastly preached Dhamma to his mother, who realized dhamma.
May all Beings be Happy!

Naked Foreign Intervention into SLs Domestic Affairs
	
Sri Lankans have been experiencing unprecedented turmoil regarding the legislative, executive and judicial functions for a few weeks now. The immediate root-cause of this crisis is the removal of the former Prime Minister and appointment of a new one by the President in exercising his constitutional powers under the constitution. It is essentially an internal matter and the Sri Lankans possess the required stamina and institutions to resolve it.
However, it is cogently evident that a few countries self-styled as international community attempt to interfere with this internal matter callously disregarding the peremptory principles of customary international laws and treaty laws. The objective of this article is to examine the universal principles of international law and to analyze whether the conduct of some countries amount to violation of those rules in the current Sri Lankan context.
The battles to protect sovereignty
Sri Lanka is an independent sovereign country. Three western powers denied the Sri Lankans their freedom and sovereignty for more than 500 years from 1505 to 1972. In 1972, Sri Lanka regained the freedom and became a Republic.
Sri Lankans fought fierce battles against those powers, i.e. battles against Portuguese at Mulleriyawa,Kotte,Danture, Malwana and Gannoruwa from 1521-1638 and in 1762 and 1765 against Dutch.
The great rebellions at Uwa-Wellassa and Matale in 1818 and 1848 against the British provide ample evidence of their bravery and patriotism with which they fought. It inspires the present generations to resist any such illegal interventions.
Sri Lankans won some of those battles while others were mercilessly crushed. For example, the British Governor Robert Brownriggs infamous order; Slaughter every man, woman, and child, including babes suckling at the breast given to Maj. Gen. Hay MacDowell in 1818, speaks in volumes the most barbarous manner of suppression of those legitimate uprisings.
These uprising arose as the British breached the Kandyan Convention of 1815. They dishonoured it in spirit and substance which led to Uwawellassa peoples uprising in 1818.
This is what the British GA in Badulla; Herbert White; reported to London after crushing it.
It is a pity that there is no evidence left behind to show the exact situation in Uva in terms of population or agriculture development after the rebellion. The new rulers are unable to come up to any conclusion on the exact situation of Uva before the rebellion as there is no trace of evidence left behind to come to such conclusions. If thousands died in the battle they were all fearless and clever fighters. If one considers the remaining population of 4/5 after the battle to be children, women and the aged, the havoc caused is unlimited. In short the people have lost their lives and all other valuable belongings. It is doubtful whether Uva has at least now recovered from the catastrophe.
It is clear from the above evidence the magnitude of the genocide that the British troops committed in Sri Lanka.
The foreign interventions have taken place during the periods where there were internal political instability and clashes among local leaders for power, e.g. Portuguese captured power in Kotte when the three sons of Vijayabahu IIwere fighting for power. That history repeats now.
The United Nations and peremptory principles of international law
UN Charter created in Articles 2(1)-(5) legal obligations - jus cogens - among individual states;
(a) The principle of sovereign equality  
(b) Member- states should observe those obligations in good faith.
(c) Member-states should resolve international disputes peacefully without endangering international peace, security, and justice.
(d) The principle against the use of threat or force against member-states.
(e) Member-states should refrain from giving assistance to any state against which UN is taking preventive or enforcement action.
(f) Non-member States should act in accordance with these principles as may be necessary for the maintenance of international peace and security.
(g) The principle of non-intervention with the internal affairs of member-states.
Principles of sovereign equality and non-intervention
The principles in (a), (d) and (g) above have been further fortified through UN resolutions and international treaties, i.e. Two Vienna Conventions on Diplomatic Relations, 1961 and Consular Relations 1963, and Rome Statue of International Criminal Court etc.
General Assembly Resolution 2625 stipulates that no state or group of states has the right to intervene, directly or indirectly, for any reason whatever, in the internal or external affairs of another state.
Also Article 2(7) forbids the UN itself from interfering with domestic matters of any State.
Article 3(1) of the Vienna Convention, 1961 specifies functions of diplomatic officials as;
(a) Representing the sending state in the receiving State.
(b) Protecting the interests and citizens in the receiving state to any limits admitted and permitted by international law.
(c) Negotiating with the government of the receiving state.
(d) Ascertaining with all the legal methods, any circumstances and developments occurring in the receiving state and reporting them to the government of the Sending State.
(e) Promoting friendly relations between the sending state and the receiving state and developing relationship in the fields of economy, culture and science.
Article 9 provides that diplomatic staff must not interfere with the domestic affairs of the receiving country. The receiving State has powers to declare such officer persona non grata (unwanted person) without assigning any reason.
The only exception to the non-intervention rule is acting in self-defence against an armed attack (Article 51).
Some countries hurriedly issued strong statements over the crisis. Are their concerns genuine Do they make those statements in good faith Are they our real diplomatic friends Or do they all have a common objective with common agenda
Judgements International Court of Justice (ICJ)
Let us now examine a few judgments of ICJ to understand the implications of non-intervention principle.
Nicaragua v United States of America;the Ambassador of Nicaragua filed this case in April 1984 against the USA. The allegations against the USAinter alia consist of the efforts by direct and indirect means to coerce and intimidate the Government of Nicaragua and intervention into domestic affairs.
The US counter-argument was that the Nicaraguan Government had taken significant steps towards establishing a totalitarian Communist dictatorship.
The ICJ held that adherence by a State to any particular doctrine does not constitute a violation of customary international law; to hold otherwise would make nonsense of the fundamental principle of State sovereignty on which rests, freedom of choice of the political, social, economic and cultural system of a State.
ICJ further held that it cannot contemplate the creation of a new rule opening up a right of intervention by one State against another on the ground that the latter has opted for some particular ideology or political system.
Accordingly, the ICJ defined state sovereignty as the freedom of states to freely decide on choice of a political, economic, social and cultural system. Intervention is wrongful when it uses methods of coercion in regard to such choices, which must remain free ones.
The interference into domestic affairs may take different forms. The common method is making damaging statements on domestic affairs. The following incidents illustrate this point.
In 1952, US ambassador to the Soviet Union, George F. Kennan, was declared persona non grata on making statement linking them to Nazi Germany.
	In 1991, President R. Premadasa declared the British High Commissioner David Gladstone a persona non grata because he was involved in the local elections.
	In 2007, the Sudanese government expelled the Canadian Charg daffaires to Sudan, Nuala Lawlor, due to her call for the release the opposition leaders.
	Serbia expelled ambassadors of Montenegro and the Republic of Macedonia after these countries recognized the independence of Kosovo in 2008,
	In 2010, President Hugo Chavez expelled US ambassador to Venezuela Larry Palmer due to his damaging comments on Venezuelas military.
	US expelled Charg dAffaires at the Syrian embassy in Washington recently.
	Also, Malawi expelled UK ambassador after Wiki Leaks exposed his disparaging comments on the President of Malawi.
Intervention into SLs Domestic Affairs
Some countries hurriedly issued strong statements over the Sri Lankan crisis. Are their concerns genuine Do they make those statements in good faith Are they our real diplomatic friends Or do they all have a common objective with common agenda Do those statements amount to threats
The most appalling thing is that those states maintained pin-drop silence when the former regime-violated the constitution, robbed the central bank, postponed the local government and provincial council elections, interfered with the independence of judiciary, created ethnic tensions by deliberately adopting discriminatory state policies and conspired to assassinate the President with the help of national law enforcing authorities and foreign powers etc.
Statements by Foreign States
Let us now analyze relevant parts of the statements to understand their intention and to examine whether they amount to violation of non-interference, non-use of threats and sovereign equality principles.
(1) USA -.We call on the President, in consultation with the Speaker, to immediately reconvene parliament.. 
(2) UK - .Iurge President Sirisena, in consultation with the Speaker, to reconvene the parliament immediately 
(3) Australia - Australia has expressed its .disappointment with President Sirisenas decisionto dissolve the Sri Lankan parliament on 9 November
(4) Canada - Canada is gravely concerned by the president of Sri Lankas decision to dissolve Sri Lankas parliamet, the dismissal of the countrys prime minister and the proroguing and dissolution of parliament, run counter ...
Also, ambassadors of those countries participated in a meeting called by the ousted prime-minister and speaker.
Conclusion
Can those statements be construed as friendly and advisory Or do they sound coercing and threatening Do the demands made in those statements qualify to be interpreted as intervening into domestic affairs and violating the principles of sovereign equality by coercions when considered in the light of purposive principles of interpretation
The obvious answer to all those quarries is in the affirmative.

Portugal to free circus animals from life of imprisonment
	

Portugal has become the most recent country to take the step towards compassion against animals with their government passing legislation to ban wild animals in circuses. The new legislation prohibits more than 40 species of animals from exploitation in circuses, including lions, camels, tigers, elephants, and zebras. Predictably, circus operators are in opposition of the ban claiming it will contribute to the disappearance of business but the government has advised that if they relinquish their animals to ethical sanctuaries by the 2024 cut-off date, they will be given support and training in a new profession. Animal rights groups from around the world applaud the move as Portugal joins countries such as Mexico, India, Iran, and the United Kingdom who have also passed similar bans.

Rajapaksa administration owes SriLankan Rs.122mn: Officer
	
A total of Rs.122.3 million is owed to SriLankan by the Presidential Secretariat, the Foreign Affairs Ministry and the Commonwealth Games Committee for charted flights they have booked between 2006 and 2014, SriLankan Airlines Network Planning Manager Sumudu Upattisa informed the PCoI on Wednesday.
The Presidential Commission is inquiring into irregularities at SriLankan Airlines, SriLankan Catering and Mihin Lanka.
Mr. Upatissa said the airlines had written to these government institutions calling for the overdue amounts.
When counsel appearing on behalf of the AGs Department asked Mr. Upatissa, he said the money was due to the airlines for the several charted flights booked by these institutions during the Rajapaksa administration.
There were several flights to Johannesburg, Tel Aviv, Rome and Bolivia. SriLankan does not fly to these destinations on a regular basis, he said.
Mr. Upatissa told the PCoI that in a charted flight to Johannesburg in December 2013, there were only 26 passengers whereas it could carry 243.
He said the Presidential Secretariat paid the airline Rs.36 million for this A340 flight which has had 38 business class seats and 205 economy class seats while on another chartered flight to Tel Aviv, Israel in January 2014, the Presidential Secretariat paid the airlines Rs.46.3 million.
Only 48 passengers travelled on this aircraft, which can carry 312. Interestingly, the plane landed first in Amman, the capital of Jordan, where 42 passengers got off. Only six people flew to Tel Aviv, Mr. Upatissa told the PCoI.
"Another chartered flight booked by the Presidential Secretariat to take 39 passengers to Bolivia in June 2014 cost the Secretariat Rs.57 million. The aircraft can carry 312 passengers. Bolivia is also not a destination that SriLankan flies to very often."
He also informed the commission that the Presidential Secretariat had not paid the Rs.43.4 million owed for a chartered flight to Rome in October 2014 and that it had 69 passengers onboard while it could carry 312 passengers. (Yoshitha Perera)

  At the Daily Mirror, we believe that climate change is one of the greatest threats that we, as Sri Lankans, will face in the future.  Therefore, we intend to provide our readers with local and international content with the objective to educate and inspire. We would also like to learn from our valued readers about any ongoing initiatives in making Sri Lanka a more sustainable nation.   
 We aim to explore sustainable ways of living that have the most positive impact on not just our natural environment, but also for humans and animals.  
While topics such as global warming, pollution, and inequality are confronting, we believe it's time the media stopped shying away from these issues and became an active participant in finding solutions - and we hope you will join us. 
     
				 		 
	
	

CSR (Corporate Social Responsibility) is growing increasingly popular in Sri Lanka with companies eager to invest their time and a share of their profits to benefiting society in some way. Currently CSR projects undertaken in Sri Lanka tend to be on an ad-hoc basis such as donations to a school or environmental group. It was because of this, CSR Sri Lanka was created with the aim of providing private sector companies a way to invest in sustainable projects. Projects that not only help the community through social and environmental initiatives but give these companies the option to take responsibility for their impact on society.

What is a circular economy In a circular economy, products are created to be continually recycled or reused which is more energy efficient than sourcing virgin materials. Our current model of consumption worldwide is called the linear economy which follows a take, make and dispose model of production. Without a circular economy, society is burdened with large amounts of non-biodegradable waste which ends up in landfills orthe ocean

Introduced into Sri Lanka in 2013, CSR Sri Lanka is a partnership with MVO Nederlands (which translates to CSR Netherlands) and the United States Agency for International Development (US Aid). Their goal  to offer companies the chance to invest in CSR projects that encourage a circular economy.
What is a circular economy In a circular economy, products are created to be continually recycled or reused which is more energy efficient than sourcing virgin materials. Our current model of consumption worldwide is called the linear economy which follows a take, make and dispose model of production. Without a circular economy, society is burdened with large amounts of non-biodegradable waste which ends up in landfills or the ocean. Already CSRSri Lanka counts forty members with the current membership portfolio reading like the whos who of successful companies in the country such as Coca Cola, Unilever, Cargills, Jetwing and Sampath Bank.
While CSR Sri Lanka has five speciality areas they cover (circular textiles, water and sustainable business, sustainable agriculture, business for waste and sustainable tourism), their most recent and exciting new project falls under the banner of Business for Waste in the form of Nikasala Piyasa  Waste Collection Centre which is located in Kaduwela.
Created as a collaborative effort between CSR Sri Lanka, Ceylon Biscuits Ltd, Ministry of Megapolis & Western Development and Kaduwela Municipal Council, the programme (which is free to join) gives members a place to drop off their non-biodegradable, clean waste. At the centre the waste is weighed and points will be allocated on the type and amount of waste given (roughly 6-8 rupees per kg. of clean waste). Once 1000 points is reached, the individual can then redeem them for 1000 rupees or in the form of vouchers for sustainable products such as homewares.
Officially opened on the 25th to 26th of October by the Hon. Patali Champika Ranawaka, Minister of Megapolis and Western Development, the initial pilot programme will begin on the 1st of December and will run for three months. A similar programme has already seen great results in Balangoda which is now one of the cleanest regions in Sri Lanka. Mr. Thilina Premjayanth, Cluster facilitator and corporate engagement officer of CSR Sri Lanka was delighted to say that even now, before the project has even finished that other regions such as Galle have shown interest in bringing a waste centre to their area.
The pilot programme in Kaduwela gives the option for the following materials can be collected:
Laminated wrappers
	Wastepaper
	Cardboard
	Newspapers
	PET Bottles
	Plastic (HDP, HDPP, etc)
	Polyethene
	Aluminium
	Tin/Sheet
	Glass
	Coconut shells
	Steel
Once the bins in the centre are full, recycling companies will come, collect the waste and take it to a processing facility when it can then go on to become other products.
One such product that could be available very soon in Sri Lanka is the eco-brick. Already being used in South America, Africa and other parts of Asia, an eco-brick is a plastic bottle (usually a 2.5L soft drink bottle) which is then filled with clean, non-recyclable plastic such as biscuit wrappers. The inside of the bottle is packed tightly with the soft plastic and the lid put on. This brick can then be used to build structures such as housing, garden spaces or furniture.
Mr Premjayanth advised that any companies wanting to start a waste collection centre will need to invest around 1 million rupees to cover all the costs. Each centre will have a manager who is paid a salary. This business model empowers the manager to make additional money from the margin he gets from selling the waste to the recycling companies. We also encourage the manager to leaflet, do some marketing, go to houses in the area and get your business expanding Mr Premjayanth said.
According to Plastic Ocean International, around 300 million tonnes of plastic is created each year with around 50% falling into the single use category. Because plastic isnt biodegradable, it stays in the environment forever, killing animals who ingest it and polluting our land and waterways. Its up to communities to reduce, reuse and recycle. With creative projects such as Nikasala Piyasa it now makes it easier than ever for people to keep the country clean, with the added incentive of receiving a financial reward.

Russia loses Interpol presidency vote
	
A man passes an Interpol logo in Singapore 

Interpol announced Wednesday that Kim Jong-yang of South Korea had been chosen as its new president, beating a Russian official whose candidacy had unnerved Western nations. 
The US-backed Kim, acting president of the global police body, was picked at a meeting of delegates from member nations in Dubai to replace Meng Hongwei, who went missing in his native China in September. 
Beijing later said Meng resigned after being charged with accepting bribes. 
There had been growing calls within Western nations for Interpol to reject Russian candidate Alexander Prokopchuk -- a Russian interior ministry official and current Interpol vice president -- over fears Moscow could abuse the role to target political opponents. 
On Tuesday, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo threw his weight behind Kim, who will serve out Mengs term until 2020. 
We encourage all nations and organisations that are part of Interpol and that respect the rule of law to choose a leader with integrity. We believe Mr. Kim will be just that, Pompeo told reporters. 
Critics have raised concerns over Russias previous applications for Interpol Red Notices, or international arrest warrants, to target those who have fallen foul of the Kremlin. 
Interpols president chairs its General Assembly while day-to-day operations are handled by the organisations Secretary general Juergen Stock. 
- Political persecution ,In an open letter this week, a bipartisan group of US senators said choosing Prokopchuk would be like putting a fox in charge of a henhouse. 
Russia routinely abuses Interpol for the purpose of settling scores and harassing political opponents, dissidents and journalists, they wrote.

## Title: THE BIG QUESTION
## Section: News Features
## Date: 22 November 2018 12:00 am
THE BIG QUESTION
	
I am sure you will all recall times when you have had multiple questions on anything and everything  some small and easily resolved, others complicated and needing extensive exploration  the latter being successful, only if you are open to rational thinking!
For me, there is one big question that needs prompt responding  not about black holes, extra-terrestrial life or even the creation. But I have been on the hunt for a convincing conclusion on this issue. What I want to know is what happens to us next
No one can deny that we have been extremely lucky to have been born into this life as a complete human being and then, having been able to find a suitable job or qualify to pursue a career, to support this life. Some of us, I know, are quite complacent, taking comfort in the thought that this is the end of the story for us, as their particular spirituality dictates, and being confident that all will be well in the end. (How so is what you will have to ask next, rationally speaking). Others think that all is planned for you by the benevolent deity, (is that not too simplistic), and think nothing of it until you are on the other side! (Well, wouldnt that be too late).
Each individual is identifiable only by his or her karma and not by his or her physical form, which is composed of the four basic elements that will invariably disintegrate
Afterlife
When conditions are so abstract, in my humble opinion, it is not too much to ask of yourself what the options available are, to explore this big question. The various scriptures can be the first port of call: As mentioned earlier, a benevolent deity who would have a sense of duty or even an obligation to see to the welfare of His creation may seem too simplistic. But if it is relevant to you and you are happy with it, that is all that matters and the case will be deemed to be closed. But if you accept the outcome afteryou cross over, come-what-may, what will be your position then Will it not be too late for any remedial engagement Is there a process for appeal or are you prepared for what comes next anyway The question now is, are you prepared to take this risk Taking everything into consideration it appears prudent to think seriously about what comes next, before it is too late.
Does science say anything about an afterlife Not directly, as this phenomenon cannot be objectively verified. Browsing through scientific literature however, one cannot help, but notice the tendency to acknowledge the continuation of life and the scepticism with regard to a benevolent source of power. These ideas are even reflected in science fiction, which continues to be popular to this day. For objective proof of course, one would have to bide time for about another century, but no one reading this article today will have that kind of lifespan at their disposal.
For those who believe that there is continuation of life after death, there are other issues to consider: What will this new life be like or where will it take place Will it be me, as myself or will it be as a different living being The answers to these questions are all found in The Buddhas Teaching. He confirms that life has been continuing from time immemorial and will continue uninhibited into the future, so much so that it is futile to look for its beginning, but recommends working towards ones salvation right from here and now. He has described His past lives in many of his discourses and a collection of 550, as The Jathaka (rebirth) Stories, are included in the Tripitaka, The Canon of Theravada Buddhism. The Buddhas Teaching is the only major doctrine that does not support Creation by an almighty being. Instead He has described the accumulation of Karma, both good and bad, which will follow the doer through their sojourn in life (samsara), creating the environment in which each life is sustained. Karma is not transferable and will not disintegrate or dissipate except under special circumstances.
Others think that all is planned for you by the benevolent deity, (is that not too simplistic), and think nothing of it until you are on the other side! (Well, wouldnt that be too late)
It will produce results according to the type of karma accrued. Each individual is identifiable only by his or her karma and not by his or her physical form, which is composed of the four basic elements that will invariably disintegrate. Hence there is no place for a soul, or anything that is permanent, for any identification. There are plenty of lifeforms, both unseen and seen with our naked eye. One may therefore be reborn as any such lifeform, dependant on the karmic force exerted. According to The Buddha, to achieve another human existence is virtually impossible. Should this be the case, it goes without saying how important it is to make the best use of this human life and seek salvation. It needs a large chunk of good fortune (karmic energy) to re-establish human life. As all things that arise dependent on a cause are impermanent, they lead to un-satisfactoriness and suffering.
This is known as Dependent Origination (Patichcha Samuppada). The Buddhist doctrine enumerates The Four Noble Truths as its foundation and The Noble Eight-Fold Path as a means of depleting the repeated births in samsara in order to reach Nirvana. The Buddha proclaimed that:
All conditioned things are subject to change, It is natural for every living thing to end in death.
The answers to these questions are found in The Buddhas Teaching. He confirms that life has been continuing from time immemorial
By following The Noble Eight-Fold Path, one can extinguish the flames of recurrent births and secure safe passage into Nirvana. It is up to the reader to explore widely and choose wisely.
May all beings be well and happy!
Accounts of Gautama Buddhas past lives are included in a collection of 550 stories, (The Jathaka Stories) and included in the Tripitaka

## Title: The question of sovereignty

The question of sovereignty
	
In certain circles, political debate has been reduced to whether or not the Prime Minister is legitimate. Some argue that Ranil Wickremesinghes ouster was illegal and therefore the issue of Mahinda Rajapaksas legitimacy is resolved by that very fact. 
Those who argue in this manner support their case in terms of parliamentary arithmetic. Strictly speaking, after the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) withdrew from the National Government, even by the injudicious and vague definition of the same, the National Government ceased to exist, and immediately Wickremesinghe ceased to have majority control of Parliament. A vote against Mahinda Rajapaksa is not the same as a vote for Ranil Wickremesinghe, let us note, observing at the same time that no such vote was taken in terms of procedures established in parliamentary standing orders. In other words, the Tamil National Alliance (TNA) and Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) may support a vote of no-confidence brought against Rajapaksa but this does not mean that they would back a Wickremesinghe premiership. 
There are minority governments all over the world. Thats not a pleasant thing of course but it doesnt mean utter confusion or dysfunction either. Hypothetically a vote in Parliament about who should be the Prime Minister might resolve the question of popularity, even if no one gets 113 or more votes. The current political turmoil does not permit such litmus tests. 
Few would say that the yahapalana regime conducted itself with distinction. At best, even its most ardent supporters would have to qualify all claims with the two words at and least
The importance of examining parliamentary support is predicated on the issue of sovereignty. In a democracy, however flawed the related structures, institutions and culture are, popular sovereignty holds that the authority of a state and government are created and sustained by the consent of the particular polity, the people, through their elected representatives. The key word is people. Representative is secondary and representation subsequent. 
As of now, the voices against President Maithripala Sirisenas move to oust Wickremesinghe and of course against Rajapaksa, stand on the issue of representation and related parliamentary numbers to ascertain popular will.
If we were to leave out the issue of legality (regarding dissolution), deferring respectfully to the wisdom of the Supreme Court, we would have to dwell on the question of legitimacy a la sovereignty. 
There are broadly two ways to handle this. First, we could examine manifestos, mandates and performance. Few would say that the yahapalana regime conducted itself with distinction. At best, even its most ardent supporters would have to qualify all claims with the two words at and least. Relative merits is a dangerous game and in the end inconclusive and of very little practical use. This is why we need to examine the second option: what do the people think
Well, peoples opinions cannot be obtained except through an election. Usually when theres absolute lack of clarity in all things parliamentary, it is best that the final arbiters on the issue, the people, be allowed to express will. That, as mentioned is in the courts as of now. We can, however, obtain some sense of where the people stand by checking out the results of the most recent election. Elections to local government bodies were held throughout Sri Lanka on February 10, 2018. Thats just nine months ago. 
What do the numbers say about how confident people were about the Yahapalana Government The Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna secured power in 239 local government bodies whereas the UNP got just 41 and the SLFP/UPFA led by Maithripala just 10. If we talk vote-percentages, the UNP got just 32,64%. If we use the Mangala Samaraweera Theorem (he added votes that the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna  SLPP  had not obtained to say that the majority were against the Rajapaksas), 67.37% were against the UNP. Close to 85% were against the SLFP (which can be taken as proxy for aSirisena Rating). 
It can therefore be argued that the current composition of Parliament is a grotesque distortion, that it does not in any way reflect the general sway of voter sentiment. Indeed, it hangs solely on dubiously worded articles in the 19th Amendment. It is an error so enormous that arguments for and against who holds the confidence of the majority of MPs is itself an insult to the notion of sovereignty and the people. One could say that the current political imbroglio is but a product of this error.
Hypothetically a vote in Parliament about who should be the Prime Minister might resolve the question of popularity, even if no one gets 113 or more votes. The current political turmoil does not permit such litmus tests
Even if we forget the numbers and what they say about sovereignty and its confusion and corruption, it would be hard to argue that the people are thrilled about the conduct of their representatives, regardless of which party they belong to. They have, by omission and commission contributed to the subversion of sovereignty. 
The people need an opportunity to express themselves. They need an opportunity to decide which party or coalition is best suited to represent them. They need an opportunity to decide who among this current lot deserves to be reelected and who should be shown the door. 
Is we talk about democracy, we need to talk about sovereignty. No talk of sovereignty makes sense if we are silent on the people and if you want to include people, then, all things considered it is imperative that elections are held. If court objects in its wisdom, then the legislative should amend the 19th to let the peoples voice be included in the democratic process. If not, they should suspend the use of the word democracy from their vocabulary.

Its time that the school authorities stopped inviting politicians for their functions because the countrys lawmakers have shown through their actions that they care less about the next generation.
The way our politicians plunder state money and waste assets make us think for a moment whether some of them even have children of their own. These lawmakers do the opposite of promoting Sri Lanka in the outside world and give a clear message that their abode-the parliament-is the place where one should aspire to be; because it entertains people with the worst track records.
Artiste Eraj Weeraratnes song Gemak Deela underscores how the underworld hugely depends on working for these lawmakers for a living. The song also recalls the history of the Parliament, which was once an institute packed with people who possessed the highest educational qualifications and also had a healthy upbringing.
The parliament once bred politicians who entered politics and spend their hard earned monies on the people. But today, politicians, who have zero assets, take to politics and earn a fortune.
This is why we occasionally have to encounter individuals who dont value ethics and fair play and need to be put in their place. One such lawmaker was Mervin Silva who was throwing his weight around when Rajapaksa was president ofthe country
Till recently, people were used to grin and bear the actions of these unscrupulous lawmakers. But with the advent of social media and the facility they afford to post video clips, these politicians have been caught with their pants down! Just the other day we read reports of some Western Province Councilors engaging in watching pornographic videos while sessions were on at the council. And whats alarming is Western Province Chief Minister Isura Devappriya going to the extent of making a request from the telecommunication authorities to block access to websites that have pornography and social media for computer users in the Western Province Council chamber. These councillors had been allegedly watching these movies while the Budget for 2019 was being presented.
Rise up
It is in this backdrop that we see social groups voicing their disapproval at the manner in which politicians are steering this nation towards disaster. Just the other day a citizens collective coming under the banner Rise up staged a rally in Colombo. Its participants were disapproving the derogatory status of political affairs in the country and demanding a political change that would render a better service to the nation.
Its enlightening to see academics and educated professionals finding the time to make their voices heard and warn the rulers that they should get their act together. All this time what was missing were the voices of the academics, young professionals and the elite. In other words their silence in the past could be termed as a sin.
Very recently this writer read somewhere that Indias silence- at the time Mahinda Rajapaksa was sworn in as prime minister after Wickremesinghe was unceremoniously sacked -was interpreted as the islands closest neighbour endorsing what was wrong.
Rise Up has also called for legal action to be taken against those who misbehaved within the parliament. In this context this writer wishes to underscore that though a decision was taken some time back to have footage of parliament sessions with the view of making it serve as a deterrent against bad behaviour, such an effort has not served the purpose.
For a fact we know that a good number of politicians havent even passed the GCE OLevel Examination. There are reports on social media websites that there is a member of parliament who was selling flowers on the wayside of the road before he worked himself into Parliament.

This is why senior citizens of this country have been suggesting for a long time to raise the qualification level to enter parliament to that of a degree. This will ensure that parliament is full of the cream of brains the country produces.
But that alone wouldnt suffice. This is because the power they acquire as politicians does have the potential to corrupt them. As much as a complete education at school is a must, the inculcating of good values in an individual must be done at homeby parents.
Sri Lanka has moved away from the colonial times of suppression and today even the least affluent have a say in electing the countrys president at an election. Many years ago just 4% of the population could vote because Crew Mc Callum Reforms allowed only the educated and those who possessed assets to be entitled to a polling card. But that system was replaced by the Donoughmore Commission in 1931 which enabled anyone over 21 years to be entitled to vote. Even inquiring into ones caste is seldom heard within Sri Lankan communities because all are now equal where receiving an education and enjoying the opportunities available to enter parliament are concerned. Educated politicians might now notice cast for an example by the way someone cooks and may causally remark Are you from this clan because you people use a bit more chili and the smell of the dish suggest so.
Code of Conduct
As the years rolled by more folks from the downtrodden masses saw opportunities opening up to earn university degrees, do business and even enter parliament. Now we have people from all walks of life in all spheres of employment. This is why we occasionally have to encounter individuals who dont value ethics and fair play and need to be put in their place. One such lawmaker was Mervin Silva who was throwing his weight around when Rajapaksa was president ofthe country.
We now have politicians of the likes of Thewarapperuma and Weerawansa who make us question the entry qualification to set foot in parliament. There will be more of their kind in the future if the Code of Conduct already stipuated for parliamentarians is not strictly adhered to.

When the last parliament session progressed peacefully it did come as a surprise. Sirisena had even thanked the MPs for adopting a peaceful approach to setting about duties within the parliament. We dont wish to see another epesode of commotion, swearing in filth and religious books being hurled at each other within the chamber. Reforming these lawmakers is possible, given that the majorty of these policians fear the Gods, even if they dont fear the law! What we need is for the lawmakers to get on with their businesses and provide lively debates which result in producing positive outocmes.
