A pricing formula for private sector healthcare services
	
Private hospital charges for surgeries, medical tests, scanning and drugs will be regulated by pricing formula making it affordable to the rich and the middle class while the National Medicinal Drugs Policy will introduced in six months, Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne said.
At a ceremony to mark the opening of the Sports Medicines Unit, the newly constructed Nurses Quarters, the JMO office and the Eye clinic at the Kandy General Hospital, he said the drug shortage was a perennial phenomenon but in reality, the problem was in drug management.
When I was entrusted with the Health portfolio, I carried out a survey on the drug shortage and I found that 80 varieties of drugs are in short supply at government hospitals at any given time. But with a deeper look at the problem, I realized that when there was a shortage of a certain drug at a certain hospital, that large stocks of the same drug is available at another hospital. The problem becomes a big issue when the media gives wide publicity but nothing is said about the excessive amount of the same drug available at another hospital, the minister said. "We set up a hot line for the convenience of hospital directors to contact the Medical Supply Division (MSD) to obtain drugs at ant time of the day and introduced an online service to exchange drugs between hospitals.
The modernization of drug management and the streamlining of the tender procedure are extremely vital to minimize corruption and delay in drug import, supply and distribution. The newly introduced system has been able to minimize corruption and supply a drug in two months as opposed to the nine months under the old system."
He said the Health Ministry would be further decentralised and many of the institutions that come under the Health Ministry would be given to the line ministries under the Provincial Councils.
The minister said the people were unable to enjoy the benefits of the National Drugs Policy as bureaucratic red tape, the drug mafia and private hospitals have sabotaged it.
Central Province Chief Minister Sarath Ekanayaka, Central Province Governor Neluka Ekanayaka and Kandy General Hospital Director Dr. R.M.S. Ratnayaka were also present. (Sandun A Jayasekera)

EPIC e-Wallet makes Bank of Maldives first to revolutionize banking within the region
	
The Maldives premier bank, Bank of Maldives (BML) becomes the first in the region to revolutionise the banking industry with its BML Mobile Pay solution designed, developed and implemented by Epic Lanka. 
Speaking on this achievement, Group Director/ Chief Executive Officer and Chief Solution Architect Viraj Mudalige said, The Epic Mobile Wallet is a state-of-the-art solution, which transforms the customer mobile phone to a digital version of a traditional wallet. With the Epic e-Wallet, the customers mobile phone can make payments and receive payments. In other words it can make you a payer or a payee and this is why it is unique. Unlike most of the wallet apps available in the market today, our solution supports merchant payments using all your payment instruments on existing POS infrastructure at any merchant outlet. Our pioneering tokenisation technology enables multiple payment instruments such as credit/debit cards and CASA accounts to be enrolled within a single electronic mobile wallet without compromising any sensitive card or account information.
He further stated Customers can utilise all of their stored payment options by simply opening the app on their phone, entering in a PIN, password, fingerprint or facial recognition and then selecting the card/account they need to utilise. The tokenisation mechanism ensures that no card information or account information gets stored on the phone but yet allows any enrolled instrument to make merchant payments via NFC as well as token number key-in (for non-NFC phones) over a multitude of channels. This enables the user to easily and securely make merchant payments, which accounts for over 90% of consumer transactions, on existing infrastructure using only their mobile phone. The Epic Mobile Wallet is engineered in such a way that customer on-boarding has a hassle-free and seamless process with no cumbersome registration activities.

Work on a new Airport Terminal that is capable of handling 20 million people will be begun at the Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA) next year, Deputy Transport Minster Asoka Abeysinghe said yesterday.
He said the new terminal would be built with a grant of US$ 800 million from the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA). It is planned to complete the terminal within two years.
The terminal we have now can handle only about 6.5 million people but 8.5 million people use it. Therefore, we will build the new terminal to handle 20 million people in the future, he said.
He said the BIA had only eight aerobridges and, with the addition of the new terminal to accommodate more passengers, the number of aerobridges would be increased to 24.
He said the main runway of the BIA would be closed for renovation in January next year.
The Minister said that they had decided to renovate the runway in January as it was the month with the least number of flight arrivals.
These flights will be diverted to the Mattala Rajapaksa International Airport (MRIA). The BIA will be closed for more than a month for the renovations. The runway is 3,300 meters long and a stretch of only 100 meters could be renovated with a new carpet layer per day as it takes eight hours to cool, he said.
He said the runway had not been renovated for more than 15 years and that about $80million had been estimated for the renovation. (Chaturanga Pradeep and Indika Sri Aravinda)

No loss to Govt. on coal deal: Siyambalapitiya
	
The Government had not incurred any loss due to the coal purchasing deal as alleged by some people and a committee of experts had been appointed to look into the matter, Minister of Power and Energy Ranjith Siyambalapitiya said today.
Minister Siyambalapitiya said there had been only one coal supplier to Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) between 2009 and 2015 and added that the CEB had incurred millions in losses due to its inefficient and inconsistent supply.
Tender Board wanted to break the monopoly and create competition among coal suppliers. Now we have about 12 competitive suppliers, he said.
He said the Cabinet had decided to give a tender to purchase annual coal requirement of 2.2 million metric tons, equally in two years and the other 50 per cent to be purchased on spot tendering, to break the monopoly in coal supply, and to purchase coal at a competitive price considering the world market prices.
He said the Government had been able to save Rs. 1.1 bn as a result of the decision to purchase annual coal requirement of 2.2 million metric tons by 50 per cent each, from long term suppliers and on spot tendering.
He said the Government had to spend only US$ 114 mn to purchase annual coal requirement of 2.2 million metric tons from long term suppliers and on spot tendering.
He said that the Government would have had to spend US$ 121.5 mn, if they had purchased coal from the Nobel Resources Company based on the old system.
We have managed to save US$ 7.5 million as we purchased coal on a new system. We have also been able to purchase the annul coal requirement of 2.2 million metric tons within seven months due to this new method of purchasing, he said.
Minister Siyambalapitiya referring to the reports of the loss of Rs. 1,803 million to the CEB said the method of calculating the loss was wrong.
The loss has been calculated by reducing the value of US$ 51.25 paid to a ton of coal purchased on long term supplier from the value of US$ 58 paid to a ton of coal purchased on spot tendering.
It is not surprising to have two prices, when two tenders were called on two occasions. It is wrong to report on a loss or benefit to the Government by considering the difference of the prices of two different tenders called on two occasions.
This US$ 58 paid to a ton of coal purchased on long term tender is not a fixed price. It varies depending on the fluctuation of the world market prices. The price of the spot tender depends on the market price each month.
This alleged loss has been calculated by taking a price on one spot tender randomly and reducing it from the price of US$ 58 and multiplying the difference from the coal stock of the tender. The calculation is misleading, he said.
He said the Auditor General had not released his report as yet and said it was wrong to create an opinion based on the Auditor Generals query. (Ajith Siriwardana)

Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe told Parliament yesterday that he did not have any knowledge about the existence of an organization by the name of the Task Force for National Reconciliation headed by former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga.
The Prime Minister said this in response to a question asked by opposition MP Wimal Weerawansa leading to an exchange of words between them.
Mr. Weerawansa said that according to media reports such an organization was headed by Ms. Kumaratunga and that media coverage had been given to its activities. He asked whether those reports were false.
I do not know about the existence of such an organization headed by the former President. If you like, you can just give her a call and check. You were old friends,the Prime Minister said.
I do not intend turning this into a comedy. Our friendship is old. But, there is newfound friendship with you and her. You two are new friends. It is easier for you to make inquiries," Mr. Weerawansa said.
" Yes I have known her from my childhood. In fact, we learnt dancing together at that time. Anyway, if she is involved in any reconciliation, isnt it good Are you not for reconciliation Please tell us, the Premier said and added that there were attempts to bring soldiers before war crime tribunals at that time. He said such war crime charges were averted after President Maithripala Sirisena took over.
You were acting in that manner. We have saved them from such measures, he said.
Mr. Weerawansa said no such attempts were made at that time, and it was former President Mahinda Rajapaksa who brought about reconciliation.
It is under your so-called reconciliation that Tamil and Sinhala students clashed at the Jaffna University, he said. (Kelum Bandara and Yohan Perera)

SL will play constructive role in Asias peaceful development: Mangala
	
Sri Lanka will play a constructive role in promoting dialogue and cooperation for peaceful development in the region, Foreign Affairs Minister Mangala Samaraweera said.
Delivering a speech under the theme Geo-Politics of South Asia at the South Asia Diaspora Conference in Singapore on Monday, the minister acknowledged that Singapore too had played a major role in helping stakeholders come together and work towards their common interests in South-East Asia.
He said building understanding and confidence among countries is a tremendous task which will require great courage, political will and perseverance.
But we have a useful example in the region in the form of ASEAN. Both South Asian and East Asian countries have a great deal to learn from this example as we navigate the transitions in the short, medium and long terms, he said.
Speaking further, the minister said that from Sri Lankas perspective, South Asian geopolitics is closely tied to Indian Ocean geopolitics.
Meanwhile, he said it would be a great and ironical tragedy if Asias hard won independence, economic development and rising living standards led to conflict and violence rather than peace and stability.
Therefore, it is our collective responsibility to identify and implement ways and means of ensuring that Asias rise creates the conditions for regional and global stability as opposed to chaos, he said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

SLFP threatens defeat of VAT
	
The Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) would defeat the VAT Amendment if SLFP proposals were not incorporated or if the tax was increased to fifteen percent, SLFP Spokesman Dilan Perera said today.
We will definitely defeat the VAT Amendment if the amendments do not include our proposals and with the ideas taken from the affected communities in the country, he said.
The issue regarding the recent VAT increase, was discussed by President Maithripala Sirisena, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake with the people who connected in the country recently, Perera said.
All members of the SLFP participated at a discussion and we showed our proposals on how to obtain tax without hurting the people.
The President assured that the VAT should be amended. So do not even dream of bringing back VAT again.
Finally the VAT should be amended. Any Government cannot rely only on indirect taxes. The Government should focus on increasing the ways of gaining direct taxes and reducing indirect taxes and it should consider providing relief to the people who are below the income tax threshold.
If the Government mainly relied on taxes, it should obtain it from the taxes that are levied on cigarettes and alcohol, he said. (Chaturanga Pradeep)

TUs want President to take over Customs
	
Hitting back at Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake on his remarks to go ahead with the new Customs Act despite objections, Customs Trade Unions yesterday urged President Maithripala Sirisena to either remove Minister Karunanayake or to bring the Customs under his purview.
The minister said on Tuesday that he would go ahead with the proposed Customs Act and described those opposing the Act as offenders.
Sri Lanka Customs Independent Government Trade Union Organisation General Secretary R.P. Wijekoon responded to the minister saying the proposed Act will destroy the economy as well as the Customs Department.
He said the minister should present the white-paper and the draft of the new Act to the trade unions and hold a referendum before replacing the existing Customs Ordinance.
If there is any white-paper, he should submit it to us for checking. The minister says the majority of the stakeholders in the Customs are with him and the opposition to the new Act is only from a few groups. This is not so, we like to remind him how the Customs was crippled during our previous TU action. The majority of TUs are against this move. We challenge him to reveal names of at least ten credible and honest people who are supporting the new Act, Mr. Wijekoon said.
He accused the minister of moving ahead with the new Act to please a group of businessmen around him and rejected the allegations that those who were against the Act of having vested interests.
Mr. Wijekoon questioned the rationale behind the eagerness to replace Ordinances of the Customs, Excise and Inland Revenue and said these were not the need of the hour. People are suffering from tax increases today. We appointed the government to listen to us and to be flexible, not to be stubborn, he said and added that they would today meet the President in connection with the proposed Act also meet the MPs and even foreign envoys in Colombo to brief them about the controversy.

Women too affected by cigarette, alcohol price increases: Geetha
	
Joint Opposition MP Geetha Kumarasinghe yesterday said the impact of the increase in the prices of cigarette and alcohol would effect women as well because it was unlikely that those who were in the habit of drinking and smoking would stop or even reduce their alcohol and nicotine intake even if prices for these items go up.
When a countrys economy is collapsing, it is the women who are greatly affected by it. Even though the government increases the prices of cigarettes and alcohol, people will not cut down on smoking and drinking. Its impact will also have to be shouldered by women of this nation in the end. They do not get anything out of this,she said.
Speaking further, Ms. Kumarasinghe said even though the government claimed that it had reduced the prices of essential commodities, people could not buy them at reduced prices from any shop.
We cannot buy essential commodities at the reduced prices announced by them from any shop. I went to Sathosa yesterday and came to know that people have to buy goods worth Rs.1,000 to be able to purchase a kilo of sugar at Rs.95. At Lak Sathosa people need to purchase goods worth Rs.500 to qualify to buy four kilos of sugar, she said.
Ms. Kumarasinghe said people were living without a clear future and added that they would join the Jana Satana Pada Yathra against the VAT and the cost of living on July 28.
MP Pavithra Wanniarachchi said there was no point in accusing Mahinda Rajapaksa and the previous government for the failure of the government and added that the failure of the government was a result of its inability to perform and its lack of unity.
If the country was given to Mahinda Rajapaksa tomorrow we would show you how to remove the VAT, provide fertilizer at concessionary prices, distribute free school uniform material and continue the development process, she said.
Our economic policy is completely different from that of the present government. We are not a party dependent on the West, she said. (Ajith Siriwardana and Indika Sri Aravinda)
