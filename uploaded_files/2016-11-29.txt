Three Sri Lankans steal Dh1 mn worth valuables from Dubai villa
	
Three Sri Lankan men were sentenced to a year in jail each for breaking into a villa in Dubai and stealing valuables worth Dh1 million while the owner was overseas on holiday, the National UAE reported on Monday.
Only one of the three Sri Lankans, a 47-year-old, was caught, when he tried to leave the country from Sharjah International Airport. He will be deported after serving his sentence.
His two compatriots, however, had already flown to Sri Lanka with most of the stolen goods and were sentenced in absentia.
The three broke into the villa of an Emirati in Al Muhaisnah 1 in August last year while he was in Belgium with his family. They used a hammer and crowbar to force open an iron safe in one of the bedrooms before stealing jewellery, money, watches and expensive pens.
"My mother sent her maid to clean up the house for our return and the maid found the place in a mess, so she called my mother who sent my two brothers to check," said the owner, 37.
An Emirati policeman said the arrested man had confessed that he and the other two had agreed in Sri Lanka to obtain visit visas to the UAE with the intention to steal valuables from houses before escaping.
"They noticed that no people were in the house and after keeping it under surveillance for a few days to make sure no one was there, they jumped the wall and broke in," the officer said.
At Dubai Criminal Court this month, the arrested man denied a theft charge but was found guilty.

This top team member is in charge of two Ministries located at two places far apart.?
?
And he has made it a habit to spend most of his time at the Battaramulla office restricting his presence at the other Ministry to a rare visit.?
As a result, the white collar high-ups of the ?other Ministry? have been compelled to call on the top team member at his Battaramulla office to get his approval and instructions regarding the routine official matters.
These white-collar high-ups with files tucked under their armpits cooling their heels in a long queue outside the top team members? Battaramulla office is a common sight on any weekday, they say.
These white-collar ones are compelled to while away their precious time for hours on end on occasions when the top team member is busy at protracted official conferences.

A patriotic humanitarian  who  shunned chauvinist ideals
	
Rare are the scholars with great humane qualities. Sir Ponnambalam Ramanathan was such an exceptional politician and academic. It is hardly possible to transpire such a great personality by a brief write-up of this sort. Nevertheless it is our obligation to venerate such a pronounced personality who fostered and maintained a compassionate vision and mission towards a world void of trivial ethnic, creed and cast prejudices on the commemoration of his 86th Death Anniversary. ?
Having a cultured upbringing, nurtured under methodical parents and given an in-depth education gained through prestigious educational institutions in the world, he earned a reputation as an international academic. He was a man of practicality and dignity. His eloquent speeches at the Legislative Council were as terrifying as lion roars that frightened the then British rulers. Every time the colonial rulers tried to suppress the basic human rights of the people of the colony, Sir Ramanathan voiced against such vicious acts. ??
It is rare that a nation has epoch-making personalities. Their vision and mission pave the way for the respective nations? forward march towards progress. Descended from a prestigious Tamil family, he came forward to defend the rights and privileges of Sinhala Buddhists each time their liberties were threatened. He continued his mission, upholding patriotic approaches and shunning chauvinistic ideologies and attitudes. With regard to his contributions towards the upliftment of the Sinhala Community and Buddhism, the entire nation is indebted to this illustrious and erudite intellectual who is remembered forever in the hearts of all. ??
The outstanding personality of Sir Ponnabalam Ramanathan was not made up of charisma alone. He played diverse roles as a factual politician, a far-sighted statesman, eminent lawyer, an eloquent orator and a true friend of all communities of Sinhala, Tamil, Muslim, Malay and Burgher. His notable role as an ardent comrade of the Burgher community was varied and appealing. Above all these virtues, his benevolence and compassion towards humanity was particularly remarkable.
Mahamanya D.S. Senanayake who was a gallant Sinhala leader and the First Prime Minister of independent Sri Lanka once extolled that Sir Ponnamabalam Ramanathan was ?The supreme person of all ages?.
?I have served the Sinhala nation wholeheartedly. I entered the Legislative Council at the age of 28. I never resolved to be a representative of only the Tamil community. I supported the aspirations of all communities alike. I observed everything with impartiality and with an objective of serving every community equally. I understood well the needs and ambitions of every man and woman of all walks from the Sinhala community. Sinhalese possess upright qualities of a great nation. They are truly innocent and kind?, Sir Ponnambalam Ramanathan once commended the Sinhala community. ?
The above statement of Sir Ramananthan is a straight hit against the so-called chauvinistic, caste minded and religious extremists of Sri Lanka today.?
A noble person of Sir Ramanathan?s calibre should have lived in the present era. Had a great person as Sir Ramanathan been born in the contemporary years, Sri Lanka would have never have undergone a painful thirty-year civil war. ??
He heroically and courageously marched forward to the greatest heights of the nation?s leadership, gradually qualifying in all spheres. Sir Ramanathan?s vision was benevolent and intellectual. He strove to shed the brilliance of his knowledge over the future generation void of chauvinistic outlooks. He struggle against the imperialist rulers to ensure the right to follow any faith and to name all important religious days of every faith as public holidays. He argued at the Legislative Council to have Vesak Poya Day branded a public holiday. Such arguments showed the depth of his philosophical spirituality as a faithful Hindu. ?
As the then British rulers tried to suppress the Sinhala community front-runners and leaders during the Muslim-Sinhala riots in 1915, this erudite scholar dared to visit the British Queen, risking his life. He could abort the imperialist conspiracy to destroy our leaders. ??
Sir Ponnamabalam Ramanathan was a symbol of Charisma. He erected the bridge of peace and reconciliation between the North and South. Amidst constant efforts of chauvinist rogues to damage this ?Bridge? which exists to date unharmed, given to the nation?s good fortune! Grateful Sinhalese should forever felicitate the profound spiritual charisma of this great pro-Sinhala Tamil.?
In resolving the ethnic issue of the country, Sir Ramanathan?s vision should be studied, examined and observed in depth. The members of the present new generation, particularly ruling politicians, should take notice of his national mission in the journey towards peace, reconciliation and harmony among nations. This brief write-up contains only a very tiny division of the biography of Sir Ponnambalam. His biography emanates the aroma of a spiritual appeal of a scholarly soul of the past. ??
Let me conclude with a brainy quote from Sir Ponnambalam Ramanathan which shows his compassion and love towards all. ?
?If Sinhalese lips will not speak the Sinhalese language, who else is there to speak it? How is a nation be lifted out of error, reformed and advanced into plains of higher knowledge except by its own language?? ??

CB takes unspecified actions against Perpetual Treasuries
	
The Central Bank has completed the on-site examination on the primary dealer, Perpetual Treasuries Limited and the Monetary Board has taken 'some' actions against the company in two instances within a month, according to the Central Bank Governor Indrajit Coomaraswamy.
At the beginning of this month, Dr. Coomaraswamy told reporters that the Monetary Board had begun to study the on-site examination report on Perpetual Treasuries for appropriate regulatory actions.
?The on-site examination of Perpetual Treasuries has been completed and the Monetary Board has considered the examination and the Monetary Board took action on the November 07 and it took further action last Friday, November 25. But at this point, I am afraid I can?t give you any details of the actions that we have taken for various reasons. But I can assure you that some action has been taken (and) in due course, you will become aware of those actions,? said Dr. Coomaraswamy.
The financial markets were livid when a leaked on-site report prepared by the Central Bank on Perpetual Treasuries, on which allegations of bond auction rigging had been levelled at, revealed that the primary dealer had made thumping profits.
A week before the report was leaked, Perpetual Treasuries Limited reported extraordinary higher profits of Rs. 960 million and Rs. 5.1 billion for financial years 2014/15 and 2015/16, respectively, much higher than the profits earned by some of the mid-sized commercial banks in the country.
The company is connected to the Son-in-law of the former Central Bank Governor, Arjuna Mahendran, who was implicated in the report prepared by the Committee on Public Enterprises (COPE), the parliamentary select committee appointed to look into the controversial bond auction, of wrongdoing.
The Central Bank?s probe on the alleged bond scandal was independent but they earlier said they would study the COPE report as well as the initial findings made by the 3-member committee appointed by the Prime Minister last year to look into the scandal.
Despite the actions that are said to have been taken, Perpetual Treasuries Limited continues to operate as a primary dealer.
The Central Bank recently set up an enforcement division with the objective of prosecuting the wrongdoers more aggressively.

The government will look into the possibility of amending the budget proposal to increase traffic fines following a feedback study, Transport Minister Nimal Siripala De Silva said today.
Speaking during the committee stage debate on the budget, Mr De Silva said the government would monitor the effectiveness of the increased fines, especially to determine whether it will eventually reduce traffic offences and then decide whether to continue with it or not.
?The increase of fines was not aimed at generating funds but with the sole objective of reducing traffic offences which is on the rise,? the Minister said adding that the National Council on Road Safety together with the World Health Organization (WHO) had taken many steps to reduce road accidents.
In addition he said the government is planning to upgrade the public transport sector in the future. ? However one cannot expect to have low transport fares once the public transport system is increased,? he added. (Yohan Perera)

The grace period of three months that had been given to vehicle owners with open papers to register their vehicles had been extended to December 31, Motor Traffic Department Commissioner General A.H.K. Jagath Chandrasiri said today.
Earlier the Government had announced a grace period that ran from September 1 to November 30.
He said the period had been extended following a request made by the Department to Transport Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva. "We made this request to the minister as there are many who have still not been able to convert the ownership of their vehicles to their name", he said.
?The Minister had discussed the issue in the Cabinet and informed the Department that the request had received Cabinet approval,? Chandrasiri said.
?The reason for this course of action is the difficulties faced by law enforcement authorities as vehicles with open papers were being used by their new owners for long periods under the previous owners? names. Transferring the ownership becomes a problem in the event the original owner of the vehicle dies,? he explained. (Chaturanga Pradeep)

Legalizing Prostitution in Sri Lanka , Pros & Cons
	
If plans to legalize prostitution become a reality, Sri Lanka would be the first South Asian country to do so. The legal background is being formed with the support of international bodies. Many people view legalization of this shadowy, denigrated profession as a necessity. We held an opinion survey on the pros and cons of legalizing prostitution in Sri Lanka.
?
Old Market
Maheshwari, Co-president of the Center for Sex Worker?s Rights (CSWR) ?says sex workers are just suppliers for a centuries -old market. ??They are facing social, physical and mental violence as society brands their profession as immoral.?
?Though sex work runs elaborately among the higher classes, lower class sex workers are ill-treated. The upper class workers live luxurious lives with huge earnings and protection from police and politics.?
?Police raid sex workers often, impose fines of around Rs. 100 but keep them in jail for months. During the stay in jail, they are abused by the Policemen, too. The Police arrest sex workers after making use of their services. Sometimes, the Police arrest our (CSWR) members, while we are providing birth control facilities to professionals, for their own protection. Is that the duty expected from the Police?? she asked point blank.
?We are working at a profession as other people do. We are human, we have children, and we are mothers. We have hopes for our children as other mothers do in this society. But we are treated like trash. Our kids are neglected in school and society. Even when we are accompanying children to school, we have to face frequent questioning by the Police - whether we use kids to engage in the same profession.?
?There have been occasions when our kids faced sexual abuse, while we were in jail. And the child abusers too say the children too follow their mothers. It?s really difficult to protect our kids, ? Maheshwari said highlighting one of the problems faced by sex workers.
Talking about the hardships faced by sex workers, she described that Negombo and Galle have serious issues such as STDs (Sexually Transmitted Diseases), especially HIV. There are around 800 sex workers in Negombo, mostly young girls employed in garment factories, who never speak out about their hardships. There are a lot of sex workers in Anuradhapura as well. It is said that most of the sex workers are found in Negombo, Galle and Fort.
What Maheshwari wants above all is social acceptance.
?
No Rights
?They are not enjoying basic human rights. Prostitution is not a crime, but people consider it a crime and unethical because all the time it is attached with social stigma. Men obviously patronize it. If prostitution is legalized, prostitutes will become known and visiting them will decrease as everyone will know so and so. At least they will be open to good health care practices.
?There is ?Brothels Ordinance and Vagrants Ordinance in which managing of brothels is a punishable offence. If women are loitering on the road, if they appear to be seducing and showing signs of prostitution, the Police can arrest them, but their interpretation could vary.?
?Now, the arresting has become habitual for Police and sex workers as well.
?
?
?What happened in the past, as to my knowledge, is that the arrested and punished sex workers are sent to Methsevana a rehabilitation center located close to the University of Sri Jayawardhanapura. I have no idea of what is happening to the arrested sex workers now.?
?If the arrested person has dependents under 18 and is the breadwinner of the family, the Police have to send those for the care and protection of the immediate family. These laws were formulated in the 1800s and the fine is as of that time. Now, we are in a process to amend the law soon. If sex workers have faced physical assault, they should seek refuge in the Penal Code.?
?
Not here
?Prostitution was a leading profession in ancient India. No historical evidence has been found on prostitution here. Kings and rulers hadn?t permitted it here. Prostitution is an existing social problem in this commercial society, which is connected with economics, politics and crimes. Even in India, prostitution is not legalized yet. Cambodia, Malaysia and Laos are among the few countries that had legalized it.
?If prostitution is to be legalized here in Sri Lanka, we have to take it into immediate consideration before the government approves of it. A broad discussion should take place with leading personalities in Sri Lanka as lawyers, the Buddhist clergy and socially responsible people, all together. First of all, a formal discussion should be held. Some people openly reject legalizing this. In my point of view, there should be a developed public opinion on this highly controversial issue.
?
?
?There are some other issues related with prostitution. This has a demand-supply curve because women avoid sex during pregnancy that leads to break between the couple, but men are sexually active all through their lives. That?s one of the reasons for the demand of prostitution.
?Street prostitution is very secretive and therefore unstoppable. Poor women find this a beneficial extra livelihood, and it is difficult to break the profitable habit.?
Prior to the revolution there was a prostitution issue in the Soviet Russia. They found the reason for prostitution as the night shifts. And they banned doing night shifts and the situation was successfully controlled.
As a sociologist, I am not against legalizing it, but it should exist within the context of other Asian countries. I emphasize that legal restrictions should exist, it should be presented to Parliament.?
Mass media play a vital role in this either supporting or against. Social reformists are against this. But this is a timely issue. If prostitution is legalized, some limits should be imposed on it.
?Western funded NGOs are supporting this legalizing in a broad prospect and some NGOs are playing a negative role in the country especially on Buddhism and culture.?
?
Better control
?Legalizing is better to detect STI?s because we issue them license and it helps to detect HIV and STIs for some extent. But legalizing only cannot control spreading STI?s as there are many private sex workers. As for now, we are continuing programs for sex workers in association with NGOs to supply them free birth control, awareness on sexual health. As recorded by districts, Colombo tops the STIs list following Gampaha, Kurunegala, Kalutara and Ratnapura. There isn?t a big issue regarding health in legalizing but socially, it will be a disadvantage as many people will engage in this profession as it is legally protected, and there will be a rise in clientele as well. According to the clinical reports, 18,979 STI (Sexually Transmitted Infections) have been recorded in Sri Lanka in 2015.

Whoredom?by Robert Knox?
Robert Knox describes ancient Sinhalese society and their lodging, bedding, whoredom, marriages, and children in Chapter VII as follows in his book ?An Historical Relation of the Island Ceylon, in the East-Indies.?
?So that youth are bred up to Whoredom. Indeed here are no Publick Whores allowed by Authority. In the City some that have followed that Trade, have oftentimes by the King?s order been severely punished by Whipping, and having their Ears and Hair cut off. But in private few or none can exempt themselves. And for the matter of being with Child, which many of them do not desire, they very exquisitely can prevent the same.
They are guilty of the thing, but love not the name. Indeed the Publick Trade would be bad, and hardly maintain them that exercised it, the private one being so great. And tho I think they be all Whores, yet they abhor the Name of Vesou, which is Whore. Neither do they in their anger reproach one another with it, unless they should lay with a Man of an inferior quality to themselves, And the Woman reckons her self as much obliged to the Man for his Company, as he does to her for hers.?
In the past, it was not taboo to find sexual pleasure out of the family. There were traditions as polygamy and people could leave their partners if they are willing to marry or live with someone else, according to sociological observations. Even before introducing proper laws, human interactions went on smoothly in past. Our society changed after Victorian law and catholic good conduct enforced on it.
?
New trend
Homosexuality has become the new trend, connected with increasing HIV, especially in urban areas. We cannot accuse anyone for being different sexually and living with their choices, but these social trends in a broad sense seriously damage health and family.
?

Definitions for prostitution by Kingsley Davis - an American sociologist.1 Prostitutes should provide their service to everyone who comes to them without any discrimination.2 It is based on money and gifts.3 No emotional or sensitive bonding with customers. ??Definition for prostitution in Encyclopedia.com?The provision of sexual favours for financial reward has probably been institutionalized in the form of prostitution in every society that has had a coinage. It has nearly always involved the prostitution of women to men, though male prostitution, especially to male clients, is not uncommon.Kingsley Davis proposed a functional theory which saw prostitution as a safety-valve, helping maintain the respectability of marriage. Prostitution certainly flourished during the Victorian Period of rigid sexual morality. But feminists have pointed out that prostitution provides no safety-valve for women, and indeed controls them by labeling those who are not chaste as whores.?Victorian prostitution was connected with double standards in morality, which was much more permissive for men than for women. Sociological studies of prostitutes show that their motivation is mainly economic and it seems likely that the number of prostitutes increases when there are fewer other job opportunities for women.?International movements of prostitutes are nearly always from poor countries to richer ones. There are few studies of clients, though a Norwegian study found that while most of them are ?Mr. Average?, there are a number of single men who have difficulties relating to women who go to prostitutes quite frequently.?

WHO Report on SEX WORK IN Sri Lanka
Anecdotal evidence suggests that the size of the commercial sex market has increased in recent years. There is a market catering to local men and a sex tourist market?.. Sex work sites include beaches, street prostitution, massage clinics (mainly in Colombo) different classes of brothels and ?satellite? brothels around guesthouses. The growth of free trade zones and the low wages paid to the women who work there propel some into sex work ? often on a part time basis. There appears to have been a growth in this type of part time sex work?.. Trafficking of women does occur in Sri Lanka and over one third of sex workers who took part in a pilot study revealed that they had been trafficked into the trade?.?
?
Child Sex
Sri Lanka has become famous for child sex workers, connected with tourism. It is said that if one needs a prostitute, go to Thailand, if need child sex, go to Sri Lanka. Even the United Nations is involved in solving the child sex trade here, as we are among the top five countries engaged in child prostitution. Among the four forms of prostitution as female, male, child and homosexual, male and child sex trades have increased at a fast pace in the recent past.
?
LEgalizing better or bitter??
Street sex workers are completely unsafe compared to sex workers in higher society. Nowadays, emerging actresses are having close relationships with young politicians, shifting sex work into a new dimension.
?If sex work is legalized, people under 18 won?t be forced into sex work,? many people said.
There are pros and cons to legalizing prostitution in Sri Lanka. As a Buddhist country with a proud history and unique culture, many disagree legalizing it. By doing so, the public is openly encouraged to engage in prostitution.?
If social acceptance is offered to prostitution, many young people will join this work force for easy money as it is legally protected.
With the discussions held on the prostitution issue, many sex workers stated that they are keeping it a secret from their families, as their true livelihood is hidden from their families, relatives, neighbors and home town. Some sex workers openly expressed that if they knew what they would have to face, they would never become sex workers.
?
Amending ?
Sri Lanka still runs on outdated laws that cannot protect the innocent or punish the guilty.?
Not only in this sector, but also in many other sectors. Setting fire to forests and many other crimes result in negligible fines and punishment. Some people do not like to review these laws because it would put them at a disadvantage.
Should we legalize prostitution or not??
Should we keep neglecting sex worker?s children? How can we protect the society from the ugly side of prostitution? All these and other unasked questions are waiting for a broad social discussion.

LOLC Finance September quarter profit slips 4% as expenses surge, margins narrow
	
Lanka Orix Leasing group company, LOLC Finance PLC, saw its net profit for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 (2Q17) narrowing by 4.0 percent to Rs.391.5 million or 14 cents from a year ago as some unclassified direct expenses and the interest cost rose sharply, the interim results showed. ?
The net interest income (NII) was slightly up by 8.0 percent year-on-year (YoY) to Rs.1.76 billion as the interest expenses rose by a faster 87 percent YoY to Rs.2.8 billion amid rising interest rates. But the corresponding interest income rose by only 46 percent YoY - roughly a half of the rise in interest expenses - to Rs.4.6 billion.?
This points to a squeeze in the margins of the business, which otherwise maintains healthy spreads as the licensed finance companies charge higher rates for their leases and loans than a bank does.?
Meanwhile, the company grew its deposits by a healthy Rs.9.0 billion or 15 percent during the six months to September amid fierce competition for funds between banks and other finance companies in a relatively illiquid market.?
The loans and leases grew by Rs.8.6 billion or 12.2 percent to Rs.79.1 billion. The factoring receivables grew by another Rs.3.1 billion to a total of Rs.16.7 billion. ? ?
LOLC Finance is the second largest licensed finance company in Sri Lanka by assets with an asset base of Rs.121.9 billion after People?s Leasing & Finance PLC, which has an asset base of Rs.144.0 billion.?
Meanwhile, other operating incomes grew by 86 percent YoY to Rs.569.3 million for the quarter. ?
The direct expenses excluding the interest expenses rose by 101 percent YoY to Rs.345 million while general and administrative expenses also rose by 38 percent YoY to Rs.756.7 million.?
The allowances made for possible bad loans grew by 11 percent YoY to Rs.286.5 million.?
Meanwhile, for the six months ended September 30, 2016 (1H?17), the company made a net profit of Rs.714.4 million or 26 cents a share, down 8 percent from a year ago.?
The NII was little up by 2.0 percent YoY to Rs.3.22 billion.?
The segmental information showed that the conventional financial services business had suffered a setback during the period as the before tax profit of the segment has come down from Rs.937.5 million to Rs.558.2 million for the first six months.?
The slowdown in the leasing business may have contributed to the poor performance as LOLC Finance thrived mostly on leasing business and vehicle leasing significantly slowed down during the period.?
Islamic Financial Services business meanwhile increased its contribution to the business as its before tax profit rose from Rs. 295.4 million to Rs.324.1 million.?
The factoring business turned a profit of Rs.122.4 million from a before tax loss of Rs.79.4 million during the same period last year.?
Besides the 90 percent stake held by Lanka Orix Leasing Company PLC in the company, Saakya Capital (Pvt.) Ltd and Satya Capital (Pvt.) Ltd held 4.57 percent and 1.86 percent stakes, respectively by the end-September 2016 being the other two largest minority shareholders.?

Nine SL sailors held on ship in Houthi rebel stronghold
	
The Government is keeping in touch with the Sri Lankan Embassy in Oman and the Consulate in Dubai, UAE to get the nine Sri Lankan sailors held by Houthi rebels of Yemen released, Foreign Affairs Ministry said today.
Ministry sources said the ship with the nine Sri Lankan sailors aboard had been held by the rebels in an area controlled by them because of a dispute that had taken place between the cargo supplier and the cargo receiver.
?We have instructed our mission in Oman, which is monitoring the situation in Yemen at the moment, to get back to us after the negotiations are concluded. We have also informed our consulate in Dubai to initiate discussions with relevant parties since the headquarters of the shipping company is based in Dubai. However, no response has been received by us so far,? sources said.
They said a court case was pending between the cargo handler and the receiver. The release of the sailors was getting delayed because of external issues such as communication among factions and lengthy court proceedings, they said.
However, sources said there was no threat to the lives of the sailors and they have in fact contacted the authorities over the phone to inform them that they are alive and well.
The ship with 26 people on-board, including the nine Sri Lankans, was taken over by the rebels two months ago.
According to foreign media reports, Houthi rebels of Yemen and their political allies have formed a new government in the country yesterday. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

Probe involving Minister pigeon-holed?
	
It was on the agenda of a very important Diyawanna committee to summon the mandarins of a key Ministry for questioning last August, but the committee has so far failed to issue the summons, they say.
?
The committee has decided to summon the Ministry mandarins to question them about a report it had received containing a long list of grave allegations of corruption against the Minister concerned.
Meanwhile, it has come to light that the errant Minister had brought pressure to bear on the chair of the committee not to proceed with their probe into the allegations.?

Railway employees on token strike on Dec.1
	
The Railway Employees? Trade Union Federation (RETUF) today decided to launch a 24-hour countrywide token strike from midnight on December 1 over several demands
RETUF Convener Janaka Fernando told the media that the token strike was mainly to express their opposition to the granting of Railway Department land to the private sector, the proposal to set up a land bank, irregular recruitment, the abolishing of pensioners? rights and the proposed Railway Development Council.
He said, the government pension scheme was established during colonial rule and not by any of the government?s since independence. The pension scheme was intended to protect public servants after retirement and his or her family after the pensioner?s death.
?As a federation we are urging government in power to safeguard the pension scheme and not abolish it,? he said.
Railway Controllers' Union Chairman Lal Ariyaratne said the work stoppage would be only for a day because we did not want to inconvenience students sitting the GCE Ordinary Level Examination. Most of the students only travel by train to reach their examination centres. "Our trade union action will continue after the examinations," he said.
The Railway Services Trade Union Secretary Sampath Rajitha said most of the recruitment had been carried by outsiders who were known to be supporters of Transport Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva.
?Our Union had a discussion with the Transport Minister on November 4 at the Railway Headquarters. During the discussions we realised that the minister was not interested about our concerns. Our problem is whether the minister is pretending not to understand what the union is saying or does not understand the real situation. At the beginning of the meeting he opposed us at every turn. We are convinced that the ministry is attempting to hand over railway Department lands to private companies,? Mr. Rajitha said.?We are warning the minister to not to lay his hands on the Railways and don?t leave room for us to change the government. Do your best to stop our token strike without trying to show us how you are going to transport the people using the government bus service. The minister is under the impression that on five per cent of people traveling by train.? (Chaturanga Pradeep)
