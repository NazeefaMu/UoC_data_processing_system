Sampanthan proposes 3 to 5 regions
	
	Newly appointed Opposition Leader R. Sampanthan, in his address to Parliament, said Sri Lanka should have ?three to five regions? with maximum power devolved to them taking a good example from India as the giant neighbour to resolve the Tamil national question.
	Mr. Sampanthan was appointed as the Opposition Leader of the new Parliament yesterday. His Tamil National Alliance (TNA) won 16 seats at the August 17 General Elections from the five electoral districts in the north and the east.
	He said he would use the opportunity afforded to him to find a solution to the national question.
	?Why can?t we have three to five regions in this country taking a good example from our giant neighbour? Despite all diversities they have been able to stay together thanks to their form of governance. Rather than having so many ministers in the centre why can?t we have three to five regions in this country vested with substantial powers of governance? There are many young members of Parliament who could be ministers, chief ministers in those regions. Give those regions maximum power. And allow those various parts of this country be ruled in such a way that the people themselves are best served. In India there are 29 such states. The country is united. The country stays together because people?s aspirations are respected, honoured and implemented by the states which have been constituted in such a way as to preserve linguistic interests, cultural interests, religious interests and so on. That is what we need,? he said.
	Asserting that his party would remain an efficient and effective opposition, he said it would support all positive endeavours of the government.
	?We will support the government in its endeavours if they are justified and are for the betterment of people. We?ll work closely with other parties of the opposition to ensure that we together are an effective opposition. We would not hesitate to work together and fight for the cause of the opposition whenever it is required,? he said.
	Besides, Mr. Sampanthan said his party would not accept the idea to increase the number of ministries in the government. (Kelum Bandara and Yohan Perera)

The latest research reveal that short stays give peace of mind and better tolerance toward the harsh realities and difficulties of our fast-paced lives which is essentially why the religious tourism spike has happened globally said The communique from the Sri Lanka Tourism Promotions Bureau. Specific to China, almost 85 percent of the people in China hold some religious belief or practice some kind of religion is what the Chinese spiritual life survey conducted in 2012 by the Beijing-based Horizon Research Consultancy Group has revealed.?
The survey also revealed that the growth of Buddhism is extraordinary, with about 18 percent of the 7,021 respondents in the survey claiming to be believers which means that more than 200 million people in the country would believe in Buddhism which gives us a view of the market opportunity said Athukorala. Together with the key Destination Marketing Companies (DMC's) we will develop a new line of tourism which will include a series of above the line and below the line marketing activity he said.
A point to note is that the number was around 100 million some years back as estimated by the Buddhist Association of China which tells us the changing dynamics of China said Athukorala that has crossed the 119,705 as at end July 2015 with a registered growth of 77.6% into Sri Lanka.

Ex JMO writes to Magistrate on Thajudeen?s autopsy
	
Ex Colombo JMO Prof. Ananda Samarasekera alleged that the present JMO had intimidated and pressurized doctors who conducted the first autopsy on the body of ruggerite Mohamed Waseem Thajudeen.
In a letter addressed to Colombo Additional Magistrate Nishantha Pieris yesterday, Dr, Samarasekera said he could not expect an impartial second post mortem examination report from the present JMO on Thajudeen?s death.
Dr. Samarasekara also said he conducted the first postmortem examination with several other additional JMOs on March 17, 2012 on the body of Thajudeen and submitted a primary report and interim reports to court on his findings.
However consequent to the commencement of the second postmortem examination he was called to the CID to record his statement on the postmortem examination conducted by him on Thajudeen?s body.
During the inquiry the detectives asked several questions from him that should be answered after carefully and conceptually studying the examination reports.
Thus he requested the CID to give him a written questionnaire with copies to the Court which the CID had later rejected assuming they were needless.
Dr. Samarasekera in his letter further stated that at the time of his retirement from public service on June 03, 2013, he took away with him the original notes that he took down while examining the body of Thajudeen leaving the rest in his office
He also said the body of Thjajudeen was exhumed to perform a second postmortem examination by a panel of doctors headed by the present JMO.
Dr. Samarasekera said while the present JMO worked under him as a deputy there were constant disagreements on administrative matters between the JMO and Dr. Samarasekera.
Dr. Samarasekera stated that the present JMO had made false allegations against him to the Director of Health on several occasions which were refused by the Director. (T. Farook Thajudeen)
