Committee should probe bribery charges against MS: PHU
	
A commission comprising former Attorney Generals and Auditor Generals should be appointed to probe the bribery charges against the President as reported in the Australian media, Pivithuru Hela Urumaya (PHU) General Secretary Udaya Gammanpila said today.
He said this was vital to protect the country's image from being tarnished.
Australian media last week reported that Australian Police are investigating allegations that the overseas staff of Snowy Mountains Engineering Company (SMEC) had bribed officials to secure a US$2.3 million aid-funded sewerage project in Sri Lanka in 2011 when President Maithripala Sirisena was the then Agriculture and Agrarian Services Minister.
The MP told a news conference that the Presidents response to the allegation was to seek the Attorney General's opinion but said this was not practical or adequate.
The AGs opinion and instructions hold no value when it comes to an investigation launched by a foreign country. The AG cant take action against Australian media institutions. Australian police are only probing whether the company had bribed the President. If the company proves they didnt bribe the President though he asked for one, the probe will end. But, we need to probe the allegations in an extensive manner with the participation of former senior officials to save the country's reputation, he said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

ECT joint venture terms changed: JVP
	
The conditions pertaining to the proposed joint venture to administer the Eastern Container Terminal at the Colombo Port has been changed bypassing the Cabinet, the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) said today.
JVP MP Bimal Ratnayake told a media briefing that Cabinet approval was given to a paper presented by Ports Development Minister Arjuna Ranatunga for a joint venture with the private sector to administer the Eastern Container Terminal with the Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA) having a 51 per cent stake.
He said this however, had been changed with the intervention of the Finance Ministry and other senior government officials.
Mr. Ratnayake said under the new proposal the SLPA will have a reduced stake of 15 per cent and that according to the proposal the Eastern Container Terminal is to be managed as a joint venture for 35 years.
The joint venture will result in the SLPA losing control of the profit-making Colombo Port. At the moment SLPA owns only two terminals while the major stake on other terminals held by others including China, he said adding that the control of one terminal was handed over to China by the previous administration.
"The proposed joint venture is not a healthy arrangement for Sri Lanka, Mr. Ratnayake said adding that this matter had been disclosed by some of the trade unions and confirmed by SLPA officials at a probe carried out by the parliamentary Committee on Public Enterprises (COPE).
It is true that SLPA is running at a loss but the Colombo Port does not contribute to these losses which are caused by the Hambanota and Oluvil Ports, Mr. Ratnayake said. (Yohan Perera)

Its all about market growth, not market share: Visa
	
By Supun Dias
Visa, a global leader in payments technology recently announced that it was setting up an office in Sri Lanka as it had identified the tremendous growth potential in the island. Mirror Business spoke to Visa Group Executive for Asia Pacific Chris Clarke, Group Country Manager for India and South Asia T.K. Ramachandran and the new Country Manager for Sri Lanka, Anthony Watson, the key officials behind the Visa operations in the region to discuss about its plans and objectives in
Sri Lanka. 
Why did Visa wanted to set up an office in Sri Lanka
Clarke : We have being planning for the last couple years, we recognized the rapid growth in Sri Lanka. The consumer growth potential was taken into account. We have a very long term deep partnership with financial institutions from the late 80.
Visa commenced operations in Sri Lanka in 1989 and currently works with 19 local banks and nine other card issuers in the market. The new office will enable us to assist our clients and the government as we work towards unleashing the potential of this country.
Ramachandran : The Sri Lankan office is set up as a liable entity just like our other worldwide entities. So the process took us about nine months. We have identified the tremendous growth and the potential in electronic payments along with Sri Lankas economic development. We can help this course by setting up a new office in Colombo, which is the second in the region
after India.
How is the relationship with the government and how do you plan on working together
Ramachandran: We have being working with the new government since mid- last year. We have being working with the Payment Department of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka to secure our payments, to make sure there not hacked because we are quite serious about to
cyber security.
Clarke: We want to contribute to the GDP. The GDP of Sri Lanka is US $ 82 billion and US $ 45 billion of that accounts for personal consumption. According to Visa, only 4.2
percent out of it is carried out as electronic payments.
If we compare with the Asia Pacific level, the penetration level is very low in Sri Lanka. So we have
to grow it.

Did the recent aggressive marketing of Master Card in Sri Lanka taken into account in setting up an officein Sri Lanka
Clarke: There are 16 million debit and credit cards in Sri Lanka. And Master Card is working hard; it is a positive thing for the country.
Ramachandran: Its not about market share, its about market growth. So everyone has to contribute, the rest of the players has to come in and develop it as the penetration level is very low.

How can we increase thepenetration level
Ramachandran: We have to increase the number of acceptance points and we need to give the consumer more opportunities to use it to purchase products. So we are working with the government to meet these objectives.
Payments industry is undergoing a rapid change with new technologies and innovations changing the way people pay and how they get paid.
Visa is at the forefront of this change and we value our long standing relationship we have with our Sri Lankan partners and we are excited about the future to bring new innovations to
Sri Lanka.
We are working closely with the Central Bank and with other government agencies to develop the e-commerce platform in the country.
Watson: Also, technology innovation part is very important. In Sri Lanka there are 4.2 million internet users, so to increase the methodology in paying bills online, the innovation part is something is what we are looking at because there is an 85 percent growth every year on internet subscription in Sri Lanka, which is a great accomplishment.

What are the plans of Visa for the next couple of years in Sri Lanka
Watson: We are trying to achieve as much as possible we can. So as we said earlier we want to increase the number of terminals across the country.
According to Visa, during the last five years there has been an 85 percent growth in Visa debit cards and a 25 percent growth in Visa credit cards
in Sri Lanka.
With 80 percent of households having access to financial service, Visa plans to tap this potential in order to get them access to electronic payments.
Personal consumption percentage of 4.2 percent has to grow, People have 16 million cards, so we want to work hard with the rest of stakeholders to encourage Sri Lankans to activate them and use them at a point of sale.

New model to administer loss making plantation companies
	
The government will introduce a new model to run the plantation companies soon, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said yesterday. 
Speaking at the United National Party (UNP) membership drive in Hatton, Mr. Wickemesinghe said all plantation companies which are undergoing losses would be brought under this new model of administration. 
Some plantation companies are not run effectively and incur losses while others are running at a profit. We will bring all loss-making plantation companies under the new model. According to this model the loss making plantation companies will be handed over to compliant people he said. 
I suggest that loss-making plantation companies should come under those who are able to develop them no matter whether they are locals or foreigners the Prime Minister said. 
He said schools with GCE Advanced Level Science stream would be set up in that part of the country while Nuwara Eliya, Hatton towns would be modernised.

We will push the country through from the debt trap to some extent by earlier next year he said. 
He said the UNP refrained from requesting courts to declare the Uva Provincial Council election null and void after the party decided to form a national government with the UPFA. We the UNPers had to face many difficulties in the past when in Opposition but we are ready to work with the UPFA in order to develop the country. he said.
The Prime Minister said details of misusing State funds under the Tourist Board for the Uva Provincial Council election and cases are taken up against some public servants. We have no intention of harassing public servants to take revenge from them. But, a proper study should be conducted to determine whether they have done anything wrong the Premier said. 
Some pro-Rajapaksa newspapers have said it was wrong for the government to conduct a probe. These are the newspapers which said Rajapaksa administration will last for 20 years. They are in difficulty now that their predictions have gone wrong, he added. (Yohan Perera)

No VAT (Amendment) Bill before Budget
	
The government is unlikely to present the Value Added Tax (Amendment) Bill before the budget to be presented to Parliament on November 10, it is learnt.
The previous attempt to present was nullified by the Supreme Court on the basis that the due procedure outlined both in the Constitution and the parliamentary Standing Orders has not been followed in presenting it.
Subsequently, the government initiated fresh action to redraft the Bill and present it in conformity with the proper procedure.
However, it is now learnt that the government has shelved the move till the budget is formulated and approved. All the tax reforms of the government will be introduced in the budget.
The government sought to increase VAT from the present 11 per cent to 15 per cent. It decided to do away with exemptions granted to some service sectors such as telecommunication.
A minister told Daily Mirror on condition of anonymity that the Bill was unlikely to be presented before the budget. The Ministers, representing Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP), have also decided to propose certain amendments to the Bill.

Top 5 Mistakes Sri Lankans Make on Facebook
	
Facebook is already considered to be one of the most used website on the planet. Numbers of users of the site increased on daily basis. But, just because it has become famous doesnt mean itll always bring us good. Here are some of the top mistakes Sri Lankans make when it comes to using Facebook. Lets identify them and make the social network site to work for us, not vice versa.
Over sharing Mania
Just because we have a medium to reach out our friends and family, doesnt mean we need constantly knocking their doors to tell what are we going to eat for breakfast, lunch or dinner Do you really need to tell everybody what you ate for lunch No, you dont. You dont share such trivial details to add value to peoples lives. When youre on Facebook, youre doing it, because you think youre lonely and desperate for approval. Its time to curate what you share on Facebook.
Idea of Always Connected
As soon as you have a notification on your phone or laptop or PC, you have the urge to look up the notification and act upon it. But, here is the thing, devices are just machines they work on the electricity supply, and you think you should be act as a machine in order to be connected always and responding to everything and anything. Remember, youre a human,not a robot.
Fear of Missing Out
Yes, you are afraid of missing out. Youll miss out on things, but it may not be that big of a deal. Facebook destructs your focus by hunting on your fear of missing out (FOMO). You check your feed while you talk with your partner, because you dont want to miss any interesting updates. You check your messages while you drive, because a friend might have something exciting to share. Lets face it, Facebook feed will be there forever, if you want to see it. But think about the moment you lose by checking something on Facebook in an inappropriate time. You should be driving carefully, not checking feed and crash your carand die. Think about it.
Endless Scrolling
You think that constantly scrolling the Facebook feed is very much important than savouring your lunch or studying for the exam. You seem to have an excuse not to do an important work, just for the sake of checking and scrolling the Facebook. You dont want to be in present moment involving in discussion with your partner in real world, but to check for something on Facebook for no reason. Remember this, Facebook can be used as your companion, with carefully curated way. If youre not curating how your use Facebook and itll be the main enemy for your productivity and purpose.
5000 Friends Goal
You know what Dunbars number is, right Yes, thats right. 150  and this is the number ofmpeople with whom we can maintain a meaningful relationship, whether in a huntergatherer society or on Facebook. But we think we should be friends with thousands of people and in stay in touch with them. Thats totally impossible and our brains just aren't big enough to cope with it. Lets be honest - you talk to your closest friends in other ways besides posting on their wall. Your real friends will still be there even if you stop using Facebook,youll just communicate in different ways  text, phone call or emails. No matter what, your
real friends will still stay in touch.
So those are the top mistakes, but dont fret, well, there is a good news, these can beovercome with your tention to get rid of this Facebook addiction, that drains your time and
energy.
Simple solution is: Use Facebook mindfully.
Using Facebook without mindfully, you will become a person of less concentration,comparing yourself to others, losing sense of reality, more stress and loss of free time withreal people who matter in your real life.Its all about choice. Choose wisely. Oh, almost forgot, a quote to engrave in the brain, Livethe moment; Leave the phone
