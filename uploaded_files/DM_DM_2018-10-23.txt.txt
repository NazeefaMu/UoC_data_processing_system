Arahat Mahindas ashes enshrined in Rajagala
	
Archaeologists from the University of Sri Jayewardenepura, who are in charge of the Rajagala Archaeological Reserve in Ampara have confirmed that it was there that the ashes of Arahat Mahinda were enshrined, Vice Chancellor Sampath Amaratunge informed the media.
The team of archaeologists from the Department of History and Archaeology of the University of Sri Jayewardenepura, was headed by the department head and eminent archaeologist Prof. Prashantha. B. Mandawala.
An agreement was signed between the Director General of Archaeology and the Vice Chancellor of the Sri Jayewardenapura University in September 2012 handing over the project to the Department of History and Archaeology of the university. The Jayewardenapura University team in Rajagala is assisted by a group of Indian archaeologists led by internationally acclaimed archaeologist Professor Vasant Shinde, who is the Vice Chancellor of Deccan University, Pune. Professor Shinde who is better known for his extensive research on the Harappan civilization is reportedly of the opinion that Rajagala site deserved to be recognized as one of the world heritages through UNESCO.
While theres an inscription among Rajagala ruins stating that the ashes of Arahat Mahinda and Venerable Ittiya who accompanied him to Sri Lanka, were enshrined in a stupa there, an extensive process of excavation begun only after the site was handed over to the university. Spread over 1600 acres, the Rjagala Reserve consists of more than 600 historic ruins and artifacts and it is believed that nearly one hundred of them are Stupas. Among the ruins is a 1.6 km long stairway as well.
The main objective of the Jayewardenapura University project is to preserve the architectural remains and the cultural landscapes of the ancient meditation monastery of Rajagala by preventing the deterioration processes and revitalizing the ancient character of a forest monastery. Plans are also underway to develop the site as a Spiritual and Ethical Development.

October 23 is the 70th Birth anniversary of legendary Muslim Congress leader M.H.M. Ashraff. A dynamic lawyer  politician hailing from Eastern Sri Lanka would have completed the Biblical life span of three score years and ten if he were among the living today. Alas! This was not to be as Ashraff passed away in a helicopter crash on September 16, 2000, just five weeks ahead of his 52nd Birthday. His untimely demise created a vacuum in the Islands Muslim politics that is yet to be filled. This article however is to commemorate Ashraffs 70th Birthday and celebrate his life. 
Muhammed Hussain Mohammed Ashraff was a pioneering leader of Sri Lankan Muslims in particular and the country in general. He was ahead of his times in more ways than one. He realised the vast untapped political potential of his community and strove to charter a course that would have enabled his people to have their grievances redressed and aspirations fulfilled. 
At a time when the conflict within the island was perceived in simplistic terms as a Sinhala versus Tamil issue, the efforts of Ashraff brought to the fore the problems faced by Muslims. The eloquent and effective advocacy of the Muslim cause by Ashraff led to a general awareness that the seemingly intractable ethnic crisis was not merely a Sinhala-Tamil bilateral issue but a trilateral one involving Muslims too. 
The Muslims of Sri Lanka, also known as Moors, have a unique ethnic identity. Constituting nearly 10% of the islands population, they are distributed somewhat evenly with about two-thirds of them in the seven predominantly Sinhala provinces and the rest in the Tamil majority North and East. The bulk of the community, including sections living amidst the Sinhala population speaks Tamil at home and are classified as Tamil-speaking. The medium of instruction in schools is chiefly Tamil. The community has also thrown up a number of Tamil scholars, writers, poets, journalists and artists who have reached eminent positions. In spite of this, the community does not perceive itself as being Tamil but Muslim. The Muslim self-perception is based on ethno-religious and not ethno-linguistic lines. This socio-cultural reality has acquired sharp political dimensions in recent times. 
Eastern Province Muslims
Although they are a scattered population, Sri Lankan Muslims have their single largest concentration in the Eastern Province where they form 35 % of the population. The enclave factor has helped the Eastern Province Muslims to elect at least five parliamentarians from the Province at each election. The Eastern bloc has at times constituted almost 50% of the total Muslim representation in Parliament. Despite this numerical advantage, the overall leadership of the community was not in the hands of the Eastern Muslim. The comparatively advanced Muslim leaders of earlier vintage from the Central, Western and Southern provinces were in charge, lording it over the Muslims from the Eastern backwaters. All this, however, changed with the arrival of Ashraff.

The comparatively advanced Muslim leaders of earlier vintage from the Central, Western and Southern provinces were in charge, lording it over the Muslims from the Eastern backwaters. All this, however, changed with the arrival of Ashraff
Ashraff was born on October 23, 1948 in the Muslim village of Sammanthurai in Amparai District. He grew up in the town of Kalmunai, in the same region. After schooling at Wesley High School in Kalmunai, Ashraff entered Law College where he passed the examination with first class honours. Ashraff went on to acquire a bachelors and later a Masters degree in Law from Colombo University. The latter feat was achieved in 1995 when he was a Cabinet Minister. He took silk in 1997 as Presidents Counsel. 
Ashraff began his political career like many an Eastern Muslim leader as an admirer of the Tamil father figure S.J.V. Chelvanayagam, the founder leader of the Ilankai Thamil Arasuk Katchi / Federal Party. He spoke on F.P. platforms and in 1976 attended the historic Vaddukkoddai Conference where the newly formed Tamil United Liberation Front (TULF) unanimously adopted the demand for a separate state of Tamil Eelam. In 1977, Ashraff was the driving force behind the newly set up Muslim United Front (MUF).
I first met Ashraff in 1977 when he was campaigning ardently for Tamil Eelam on the TULF platform. He had formed the MUF and signed an agreement with Appapillai Amirthalingam. Muslim candidates were fielded on the TULF Sun symbol in Kalmunai, Sammanthurai, Puttalam and Mutur. Another assigned to contest Seruwila failed to submit nomination papers at the last minute. 
Ashraff himself did not contest but actively campaigned in 1977.This was the time when he stated publicly that even if elder brother Amirthalingam could not deliver Tamil Eelam younger brother Ashraff would do so. The highlight of his speeches then was this bombastic pronouncement that even if Amirthalingam himself abandoned the goal of Eelam, Ashraff would continue to strive for it. 
Muslim United Front (MUF)
In spite of this affinity towards Tamil Eelam on the part of Ashraff, the Eastern Muslim voters had different ideas and rejected the MUF candidates on the TULF ticket. This was an eyeopener to Ashraff. The electoral results showed that despite Ashraffs desire to share a Tamil-Muslim political vision, Eastern Muslims had other ideas. While the Tamil candidates of the TULF swept the 1977 polls, no Muslim from the party won a seat. 
Ashraffs relations with the TULF became strained gradually. The 1981 District Development Council elections saw the TULF going to polls on a Tamil slate of candidates. Ashraff wanted Muslims to be included in Mannar and the three Eastern districts. He was rebuffed. This led to an already estranged Ashraff parting ways with the TULF completely.

However this did not result in him joining a Sinhala dominatednational party like other Muslim leaders of old who cut their political teeth in the FP and then merrily crossed over. Ashraff realised that the Muslims needed to charter a separate course independent of Tamil and Sinhala politics. This led to his aligning with Ahamed Lebbe of Kattankudi and co-founding the Muslim Congress. After Ashraff parted ways with the TULF the MUF had entered a state of decay. The SLMC was inaugurated on September 21, 1981. At that point, the SLMC was more or less an Eastern outfit concerned more with socio-cultural than political issues. 
The July 1983 anti-Tamil pogrom and the consequent escalation of armed Tamil militancy led to a situation where Muslims became increasingly insecure and apprehensive of their future in a Tamil state. On the other hand, the contemptuous manner in which the J.R. Jayewardene regime dismissed the Muslim opposition to the resumption of diplomatic relations with Israel touched a raw nerve in the community. 
Ashraff was instrumental in organising protest demonstrations over the issue. However, Sri Lankan Muslims at that time were immune from the global trend of growing Islamic consciousness and radicalism. The Muslim community in the East also produced a new generation of educated and ambitious youth. All this created a suitable climate for himand his brand of politics to arrive on the national scene. The rise of Tamil armed militancy instilled a sense of political insecurity and urgency into Muslim politics.
Tamil-Muslim Violence
The catalyst was the outbreak of violence between Tamils and Muslims in the Kalmunai-Kaaraitheevu areas in 1985 which was aided and abetted by agents of the state and Tamil militant groups. The Kalmunai-Karaitheevu Tamil-Muslim violence of 1985 affected Ashraff directly. Threatened by and fearing harm at the hands of Tamil militants, Ashraff was forced to flee to Colombo.

I was in close contact with him during the 1986-88 period. It was then that I saw him at close quarters forging a new vision and mission for his people. Some of his ideals seemed impossible to achieve then. Ashraff wanted the Muslims to be recognized as a separate and equal entity on par with the Sinhala and Tamil people
Ashraff moving to Colombo as a political refugee was a significant milestone in his life. In the nations capital, his political horizons began to extend beyond the East. He recognized the widespread disappointment prevalent among the Muslim masses with their elitist leaders. Ashraff identified the need and yearning of the community to assert boldly and articulate their identity. 
Ashraff was disgusted with the politics of Muslim leaders in the UNP and SLFP. He felt that these people were nothing but minions serving respective Governments without evincing real concern for the Muslim plight. One reason for this Ashraff felt, was the lure of power and the attraction posed by the spoils of office. An Independent voice was necessary. For this concrete Muslim unity was needed. 
Establishing himself firmly in Colombo, Ashraff revived and restructured the Muslim Congress. In 1986 he convened an Island-wide convention in Punchi Borella and formally took over party leadership after gently easing out Ahamed Lebbe. I was a witness to this eventful moment in the history of the Muslim Congress. I attended the convention in a journalistic capacity along with my departed friend and colleague M.P.M.Azhar of a popular Tamil daily newspaperwho later edited another Tamil language Muslim weekly. There was magic in the air as the Muslim delegates took their decisive step on a long journey that continues to date. 
I was in close contact with him during the 1986-88 period. It was then that I saw him at close quarters forging a new vision and mission for his people. Some of his ideals seemed impossible to achieve then. Ashraff wanted the Muslims to be recognized as a separate and equal entity on par with the Sinhala and Tamil people.The Muslim people in all parts of the Country needed their own independent political party. The SLMC was to fulfill that role. The party was to remain independent of Sinhala and Tamil political over-lordship. The Eastern Province Muslims were to play a greater role in this project. By doing so, this historically neglected people were to achieve their rightful place under the Lankan sun. 
Muslim Majority Council
Ashraff also introduced the demand for a territorially non-contiguous North-Eastern Council for the Muslims on the Pondicherry model of India. His aim then was to create a Muslim majority council linking up all Muslim majority AGA divisions in the North-East. Ashraff gradually redefined the objectives and redrafted the constitution of the Muslim Congress to make it an all-island party. It was formally accredited by the Election Commissioner and allocated the symbol of the tree on February 11, 1988. The new SLMC under Ashraff contested the Provincial Councils in 1988. It won 17 seats in the North-Eastern council and 12 in the Western, North-Western, Central and Southern Provincial councils. The proportionate representation system helped the fledgling party to record an impressive showing in the provincial council elections. The Muslim Congress had come of age.

The SLMC also supported Ranasinghe Premadasa in the 1988 presidential elections. In 1989 the Muslim Congress contested the parliamentary polls and won four seats. Ashraff himself was returned with a massive number of preference votes. 
The SLMC discovered that in spite of its all-island appeal the parliamentary seats it was able to garner came from the North-East alone. Ashraff realised that if the party was to maximize its representation, tactical compromises would have to be made and strategic alliances with major parties formed. In 1994, he did just that in the accord with Chandrika Kumaratungas Peoples Alliance. The SLMC contested under its own symbol in the North-East and on the PA ticket in the other provinces. The party won six seats and got another three on the national list. 
The SLMC played a constructive Queen makerrole to install the Chandrika Kumaratunga government in a hung Parliament. Ashraff became Minister for Ports, Shipping and Rehabilitation. Later he lost shipping in a reshuffle. Two other SLMC members, Hizbullah and Aboobakr, became Deputy Ministers. Then SLMC general secretary and current Muslim Congress leader Rauff Hakeem became Chairman of Committees. 
Ashraffs ministerial tenure was eventful and controversial. He was accused of providing Muslims jobs on a massive scale in the various harbours coming under his purview. Likewise he was faulted for giving priority to Muslim areas in the matter of rehabilitation projects. A tempestuous feud between Ashraff and another Muslim Minister from the SLFP, AHM Fowzie, saw sparks fly at regular intervals. This led to Ashraff throwing political tantrums at every turn and threatening to resign. 
Supreme Thalaiver (Leader)
Ashraff was also autocratic in his handling of party affairs. He was the supreme Thalaiver (leader) and brooked no nonsense from within. At the time of his death, he had suspended the party membership of three MPs and sent a show-cause notice to another. 
Apart from the charismatic sway Ashraff had over the Muslim masses, his strength was his adaptive flexibility . The SLMCs fundamental demand had been for the creation of a territorially non-contiguous Muslim majority council consisting of the Muslim divisions in the North and East. Ashraffs rationale in this issue was to preserve for the Eastern Province Muslims their 33% representation as far as possible in a proposed merger situation where it would have dwindled to 17%.
The inspiration for the territorial non-contiguity principle was the Indian model for the Union Territory of Pondichery, Karaikal, Yanam and Mahe where areas far apart came under a single administrative system. When he found the demand unachievable, he substituted it for the South Eastern Provincial Council comprising the electoral divisions of Sammanthurai, Pottuvil and Kalmunai.

He gave up that too when it became necessary and opted for a merged North-East with adequate safeguards for Muslims including a de-merger proviso by referendum in 10 years time. 
Ashraff also wanted to carve out a distinctly Muslim-majority coastal district known as Kalmunai out of the existing Amparai District. He was however hesitant in some respects because he feared the contemplated littoral district could be deprived of adequate land and water resources. While the interests of his own community were paramount for him, Ashraff was also extremely sympathetic to the Tamil problems and grievances. Except where the interests of Tamils and Muslims clashed directly, he tried to help realise the legitimate aspirations of Tamils. He also arrived at an understanding to achieve a working relationship with the Ceylon Workers Congress representing Tamils of Indian origin. 
National Unity Alliance
Ashraffs greatest virtue was perhaps his metamorphosis from a sectarian leader to a national one. By 2000 his horizons broadened and Ashraff formed the National Unity Alliance (NUA). He was now prepared to look beyond Muslim ethnicity and reach out to other communities. He had a blueprint for achieving lasting peace by 2012.
The NUAs birth indicated that the one-time Tamil Eelamist supporter who pioneered an exclusive party for Muslims had reached an evolutionary stage where his outlook was blossoming into a broader Sri Lankan nationalist perspective. While the SLMC was to be the flagship of the Muslims, the NUA was to be wider and inclusive representing all communities. 

On September 16, 2000, Ashraff flew aboard an MI-17 helicopter of the Sri Lanka Air Force above the Urakanda mountain range in the Aranayaka area in Kegalle district of Sabaragamuwa province. The copter crashed resulting in the death of this dynamic political leader
One does not know what the future may have been of the SLMC and NUA, had Ashraff lived to implement his vision. Sadly, hedied a few weeks before the scheduled poll on October 10, 2000. Ashraffs life being snuffed out was a setback to the limitless possibilities offered by the grand alliance at that juncture. 
On September 16, 2000, Ashraff flew aboard an MI-17 helicopter of the Sri Lanka Air Force above the Urakanda mountain range in the Aranayaka area in Kegalle district of Sabaragamuwa province. The copter crashed resulting in the death of this dynamic political leader. Along with Ashraff, 14 others, including crew members, security personnel, personal staff and political supporters had lost their lives in that tragic crash. 
Ashraffs loss was keenly felt by country and community. The sense of loss was compounded further by the sorry state of post-Ashraff Muslim politics. The party he breathed new life into underwent dissension. His widow and erstwhile deputies fought for his mantle. His political legacy got fragmented with the SLMC undergoing a number of splits at different points of time. Thus we see Ashraffs lofty goal of uniting Muslims under one banner lying in tatters with his party being atomized again and again after each parliamentary poll. 
Sri Lanka Muslim Congress (SLMC)
His ideal of Muslims retaining their independence and maintaining an equidistance between Sinhala and Tamil politics too has suffered badly. The perks and privileges offered by successive Governments have led to most ex-SLMC leaders abandoning their independence. The ministerial, deputy ministerial posts, corporation chairperson, director posts, ambassadorial assignments etc have overwhelmed most of these politicos nurtured in the nursery of the SLMC. The interests and welfare of the Muslim voters who elected them are have been callously and cynically abandoned by those elected seeking power and perks. Principled politics is
conspicuously absent. 
Against this dismal backdrop, Ashraffs vision for his people of an oasis in the bleak desert is turning into a mirage. In such a situation, party loyalists and those concerned about the welfare of the Muslim community continue to focus on MHM Ashraffs memory for some consolation at least. Ashraff may be no more but his spirit pervades Muslim political consciousness still. In life he was the single most popular mass figure in Eastern Muslim politics. Even after death the magical hold he retained over Muslim masses lingers on even after 18 years.

Chinese ceramic found in Lankan ruins: Shanghai Museum
	
Archaeologists from Shanghai Museum have unearthed a large number of ceramic pieces, most of which appear to be have been made in China, from the Allaippidy ruins in Sri Lanka, a country on the Indian Ocean, the China Daily reported.
This shows the links that existed between China and other countries through the ancient maritime Silk Road.
The discovery was announced on Sept 29.
The archaeological team set out on its first overseas mission to Sri Lanka in August, when they took 40 days making a comprehensive survey of the harbor city of Jaffna and its surroundings, as well as the excavation sites in the Allaippidy and Kayts Fort ruins, according to Chen Jie, head of the team.
Chen and his colleagues excavated in an area of 92.4 square meters at the Allaippidy ruins, where 650 pieces of ceramic were found, more than 600 of which were made in China.
Majority of the Chinese ceramic pieces date to the late half of the 11th century or the early 12th century, according to Lu Minghua, a researcher on Chinese ceramic with Shanghai Museum. There were bowls, plates, saucers and pots, mostly produced in places that are now located in present-day provinces of Guangdong and Fujian for the overseas sale.
The museum has increased its study of the ancient maritime Silk Road, according to museum director Yang Zhigang.
Historical documents in Sri Lanka and China show that visits between China and Sri Lanka started 2,000 years ago. In 1911, a stone tablet with inscriptions discovered in Sri Lanka spoke of Chinese explorer Zheng He making multiple visits to the island country to expand trade and friendship between the two countries.
The archaeological achievement will play an important role in the studies of the trading route of the ancient maritime Silk Road, transportation networks as well as cultural communication between China and Sri Lanka, Yang says.
The museum has signed a five-year partnership contract with the Central Cultural Foundation of Sri Lanka to research the history of the ancient maritime Silk Road, perform excavations in some of the important ruins and sites in Sri Lanka, present joint exhibitions and initiate staff exchanges.
It takes many hours by road from Colombo, the commercial capital of Sri Lanka, to Jaffna, which is situated in the north of the country. The Shanghai museum team also shared their expertise with colleagues in Sri Lanka on aviation photography, 3D modeling and ancient Chinese ceramic conservation, such as knowledge about characteristics of Chinese ceramic from different periods.
Shanghai Museum had a "successful excavation" in Qinglong town in suburban Shanghai two years ago, revealing the town's history as a trading center of Chinese ceramic, and the discoveries were showcased at a special exhibition.
"With the help of our partners in Sri Lanka, we hope to do the same with this project," Yang says.

Death of Kashoggi and the death-knell of liberal values
	

Jamal Ahamed Khashoggi, the Washington Post correspondent, US resident and Saudi dissident was killed in the Saudi embassy in Turkey.
Since the allegations surfaced, the Saudis have gone from blanket denial of knowing anything about Khashoggis whereabouts, to finally admitting Khashoggi died in the Saudi embassy in Turkey - quite accidentally of course, in the course of a tussle! According to the Saudis, Khashoggi got involved in fisticuffs while in the embassy and died as a result. Saudi Arabias de facto ruler Crown Prince Mohamed bin Salman claims he has no knowledge of the incident. 
It was by chance of course, we are supposed to believe, bin Salmans Deputy Intelligence Chief , Ahmad al-Assiri and Saud al-Qahtani, senior aide to the Crown Prince, plus a slew of Saudi security personnel suddenly descended on the Saudi embassy/consulate a few hours before Khashoggi was due to arrive. Khashoggi himself, was expecting to complete paperwork needed to marry his fiancee who waited outside the embassy. According to evidence in the hands of the Turkish authorities, Khashoggis fingers were cut off while he was still alive.
From nomadic tribes traversing the Arabian desert grew, the House of Saud, the present rulers of Saudi Arabia.
Over the years, the Saudi royal family has passed the kingdom between founder Ibn Sauds 45 or more sons, from one son to another depending on who was more powerful and Prince Mohamed bin Salman (MbS) is the first grandson of the late founder to wield power. The oceans of oil beneath the desert sands which make up the kingdom, native cunning or a sound understanding of geopolitical realities led the founding king of the House of Saud, to throw in his lot with the leading imperial powers of the day. He thus ensured Saudi Arabias and his familys dominant position in Middle East affairs. 
Saudi Arabia and its monarchs are to the US and the West, key to ensuring an uninterrupted, cheap flow of precious oil on which the western sky-scraper based model of economic development depends, as well as to contain nations like Iran.
Until recently this strategy of the late Ibn Saud has held good. That is, until journalist Jamal Khashoggi a critic of the Crown Prince, the de facto ruler of Saudi Arabia, was lured into and killed in the Saudi Consulate in Turkey.
Since his rise to power, MbS has exhibited narcissist tendencies, the jailing of his rival cousins, torture of critics, silencing dissenters and waging a brutal war in Yemen and creating in that country a staggering humanitarian crisis. The killing of Khashoggi is in character.  Though Saudi rulers have not been known for their liberalism, the sending of a hit squad with instruments of torture to eliminate a dissident on foreign soil is the act of a brazen, arrogant, mad man who cares tuppence for any country or individuals opinion -- international or otherwise. The world at large with the exception of the US, (which attempted to provide the Saudis with an out, suggesting the killing could be the work of a rogue agent) condemned the deed. 
But will the EU, Britain and the US impose sanctions on MbS and the kingdom of Saudi Arabia, as they did against Russia, over the still unproven charges of poisoning the Skripals in Britain or for Russias annexation of Crimea
The US President has already ruled he would not endanger the $115 billion arms deal he signed in May 2017 with Saudi Arabia which includes the sale of warships, helicopters, plus maintenance of the same. Certainly not over a trivial matter like the premeditated torture and killing of a journalist! Other than withdrawing from Saudi Arabias Future Investment Initiative (FII) Conference in Riyadh next week, action has been limited to words of criticism. 
A mild slap on the wrists so-to-say. 
Saudi oil, the containment of upstart nations like Iran who choose to stand up to US and Western domination, follow policies independent to those of the west and attempting to govern the prices of its resources are far more important than principles and value systems. Sadly the grisly killing of Saudi journalist Khashoggi seems destined to end up in the dustbins of history.

Debt repayment priority, not rupee depreciation, says Mangala
	
The governments priority at the moment was debt repayment and not countering currency depreciation as it was a common phenomenon experienced by many emerging and frontier economies, Finance and Mass Media Minister Managala Samaraweera said today.
Addressing a news briefing at the ministry premises, he said the government was more concerned about repaying the debt pile it inherited rather than being anxious about the rupee depreciation.
Some groups raise the point that rupee depreciation has led to a serious economic quandary in the country. However, I should say that rupee deprecation does not reflect the downfall of the countrys economy, Samaraweera stressed.
The economy would deteriorate, if we failed to settle our debts. But when it comes to rupee depreciation, it is not at all a strange phenomenon. As far as todays economy is concerned, rupee deprecation is not a serious issue that requires plenty of attention, he added.
The rupee has depreciated over 12 percent over the US dollar so far this year. A sharp depreciation of the local currency has implications to the all aspects of peoples lives since Sri Lanka is an import-dependent economy.
The rupee depreciation also adds to the debt burden as Sri Lanka has significant amount of dollar debt. (Sheain Fernandopulle)

Get the country  back on track
	
More than 75% to 80% belong to lower middle class but look at the new vehicles on the roads

Parliamentarians need to realize that they must practise austerity
	The role of the politician is not to grant but to generate employment
	Bring down the glory of Parliamentarians

We are going through a very critical phase in Sri Lanka. The country needs immediate measures to put things back on track which will give short and long-term lasting results.
In order to achieve that we need procedures in place while being mindful that our programmes MUST give results, which benefit all citizens and not just a few, as previous programmes and projects have.
For example, we are all well aware that the airport in Mattala, the Port in Hambantota, the Convention Centre in Hambantota and even the Uma Oya Project in the Uva Province have not given us the expected results.
Some of these projects have become white elephants while others are yet to prove fruitful.
Austerity
First and foremost, the current Parliamentarians (And politicians in general) need to realize that they must practise austerity. Over the last few years, people have been talking about austerity.
However, the Ministers and officials are still going for luxury vehicles and other commodities at the expense of the public.
About 75% to 80% live below the lower middle class level or even below. These people cannot afford to spend Rs. 250 to survive the day, but look at our roads, they are full of new and nearly new vehicles- when a large majority cannot even make ends meet.
Where is our conscience in all this How can one strata of people afford luxuries while the other suffers in poverty
A vast majority of Parliamentarians have come from similar backgrounds. They have not had luxuries as children. Probably their parents had to forego meals to feed them and send them to school. So, poverty and suffering is not something that they are unaware of. But, the moment they see any sign of money, they change and change for the worst.
The question is how the three levels of administration; Local Authorities, Provincial Councils and the Centre (Parliament) complement each other.
We need to, at some point, question whether the Provincial Councils are a requirement in this small country.

The vehicle permit is such an attraction to get into Government Service. And these professionals have no shame that housemaids in the Middle East, women in the clothing industry and the tea industry are paying for all these
Choosing the right people
If we look back into our history of post-independence politics and governance, we seem to have gone backwards.
We fail to choose the right people into the governance structures. At present we see candidates who have earned money by illegal means and contributed little to society.
A tin sheet or a cooking utensil had earned votes for unsavoury characters. However, it is not untrue, that the voter would like to vote for quality people; by which I mean learned, honest and with integrity.
Here, the political party must put forward the right candidates. The party can use a vetting process before offering candidacy.
Expertise in Ministries
There is still a way to overcome this problem. The Government must get experts to the Ministries who will be responsible for fashioning the policies of the Ministry.
The experts should be paid an allowance for the work they do for the Ministry and not salaries and exorbitant benefits.
This way, we can ensure that only the committed experts will come forward. Money should not be the determining factor in appointing these experts.
Do all Cabinet Ministers, read all the papers presented prior to voting for them In such situations, these experts I propose could lead to healthy discussions before approvals.
Members of Parliament should find time to attend committees. Opening buildings and attending all events in their constituency is not really their job.
Doling out money is not the best way to alleviate poverty. Free money creates more poverty unless people are made to work somewhere to earn that dole.
By all means, the Government must protect the ultra poor as they are very vulnerable, especially with the rising Cost of Living.
There has to be a safety net but first, the Government must keep a tab on income disparity.
Protect the Farmer
The farming community in this country has been having a raw deal for decades now. They have serious problems with regards to fertilizer, then the unpredictability in the weather due to climate change such as drought and floods. As the food producers to the nation, they need a safety net as well. As a country, this is where we should place our investment because if we can ensure food security, we can resolve almost all the other problems.
The Government needs to know why some food items are imported. For example, bananas are being imported Then what about the local banana farmer How can we safeguard his/her business Why cant the Government intervene to control the imports of this nature
As a nation, we must popularize agriculture. During our schooling, agriculture was drilled into our systems. But no more.
Permits
It is no secret that the issuance of vehicle permits has destroyed the country. In my opinion, no one should be given a permit.
If we do, there has to be a ceiling on the value or the engine capacity. The person should return the vehicle and not make a sale and make a profit or buy it from the government.
Today, the vehicle permit is such an attraction to get into Government Service. And these professionals have no shame that housemaids in the Middle East, women in the clothing industry and the tea industry are paying for all these.
And will any of these women be able to buy such a vehicle ever

All benefits and perks should be removed and there should not be too many overheads and many employees
Members of Parliament
There is a notion that they can appoint people to be in his staff and have them being paid a salary. The Ministers should revert to the old but correct system of working with Ministry officials, who are qualified Public Servants.
There must at least be a limit to the number of persons that a Minister can appoint to his Ministry. The role of the politician is not to grant but to generate employment.
It is imperative that we bring down the glory of being a Parliamentarian. All benefits and perks should be removed and there should not be too many overheads and too many employees.
Water, electricity and telecommunication can be provided at a far reduced price than it is now. But because all these institutions are loaded with people, the costs are high. The burden is on the voter.
The Executive
It is no secret that President J. R. Jayewardene was the ideal Executive President we ever had. He knew the role and the requirements of that role. Although the position had ultimate powers he hardly exercised them. He never interfered with the Ministries.
Then again he had the right people in the Cabinet. But look at the Executive thereafter, the post-holder gets involved in everything.
This started with Premadasa and continues TO DATE. Except for J.R. Jayewardene, all other Presidents have been having a large secretariat for the President to run the country. It looks like there is a Government within a Government (While having an Opposition within the Opposition)
The Judiciary
This is an extremely delicate topic which needs to be handled with care. The establishment of rule of law is essential for a country. But it has to be seen that it has been established. The Judiciary should not be subjected to pressure by the administration. They must deliver judgement in keeping with so many principles. They could be deliberate messages to society so that there will be no repetition.
Litigation cases piling up is a serious concern. It appears to be a systemic flaw. If a case is heard for 15- 20 years it serves no purpose. Especially child abuse cases which take over 10 years serves no justice to any victim.
They must come with a plan to reduce the backlog. The purpose of the judiciary is to be decisive and swift so that we create a law-abiding society.

Going about with security just for show!
	

A provincial politico now shorn of high position and authority continues to enjoy the privilege of being guarded by a six-member security detail, they say.

The security men follow the dude wherever he goes though there had never been a threat to his life.
All provincial high-ups had their personal security withdrawn soon after the council was dissolved, but this politico continues to enjoy the privilege thanks to the benevolence of a very high political authority, they say.

Govt. failed to uplift the people: JVP
	
Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake said today people should rally round to send off the government which was not giving relief to the people and selling off State property.
Speaking at a protest march held in Colombo yesterday, he said that they would ensure that another corrupt lot would not take over by sending off the current lot.
It is only the Prime Minister, ministers and smugglers were happy today. This has become an oppressive government. People including farmers and fishing community started to rise against the government. Graduates have left without jobs. Free education is scrapped, he said.
He said these rulers and their policies have not been able to uplift the peoples livelihood for the last seventy years and added that an alternative force was need of the hour.
People should come forward to defeat the anti-people government. It should be done not allowing another corrupt lot to take over, he said.
The protest march attended by massive crowds kicked off at Punchi Borella yesterday evening and gathered at the Colombo Fort where they held a rally. (Ajith Siriwardana)

Letting officials to run PCs tantamount to dictatorship: EC
	
Elections Commission Chairman Mahinda Deshapriya has sent a hard-hitting letter to the government and recognized political parties informing them that getting officials to run provincial councils was undemocratic and likened it to an administration of dictatorship.
The Elections Commission said this letter had been sent to the Provincial Councils and Local Government Ministry and other recognized political parties.
The letter said that a bureaucratic rule was just like the twin brother of dictatorship.
Mr. Deshapriya told our sister paper Lankadeepa that the Delimitation Review Committee of the Prime Minister was in operation at the moment and that its report was due in a week.
He said the commission was expecting to commence the process to hold the provincial council elections from the first week of November.
Meanwhile, the tenure of the Northern Provincial Council is due to expire tomorrow, and by now the tenure of six provincial councils have expired and their administration have been handed over to bureaucrats. (Ranjan Kasturi)

Medal winner at World Youth Olympics wonder girl Parami sees stiffer hurdles ahead
	
Parami Vasanthi Maristella faced a stiff challenge from contestants from across the globe
	She enjoyed running on the beach

The parents expressed extreme rejoice over the victory of their daughter Parami Maristella - an emerging star from the Ambakandawila sea area. She enjoyed running on the beach with her sister as a little girl. Now she is able to compete at the hurdles event and won a Bronze medal at the World Youth Olympics, held recently in Argentina.
K.M. Parami Vasanthi Maristella (17), from Ambakandawila village in Chilaw, contested the 200m hurdles event at the athletic Championships of the Youth Olympics and faced a stiff challenge from contestants from across the globe.
Paramis elder sister Nishanthi Dilhani, an undergraduate at the Sabaragamuwa University, is too an athlete. When she was practicing for school sportsmeets, little Parami also joined her as a means of providing her with security.
Rita Margrette Silva (43), the mother of Parami, lives on the beach and toils to earn and sustain the family. She sells the fish caught and brought to the beach by her husband K.M. Anthony Tudor Fernando (49), who struggles for hours at night with his simple canoe negotiating the rough sea.

The two sisters had opportunities to compete at international athletic Championships
Rita says that when Nishanthi Dilhani began to display her skills in athletics at the Ambakandawila School she was offered admission to the Kuliyapitiya Central as there were no facilities for sports at the village school. Parami also ran with her sister on the beach which probably helped her to achieve this success.
On a later stage Parami was also able to receive a scholarship to Kuliyapitiya Central due to her skills in sports.
The two sisters had opportunities to compete at international athletic Championships thanks to the encouragement and assistance coming from the master in charge of sports at Central College. They had successfully performed at several such events.

Struggle to survive
Speaking about the skills of her daughters, Rita also mentioned about their struggle to survive.
We have only a small house barely completed. That too we had to mortgage so that we could borrow Rs 250,000 from the rural bank. The house was about to be seized because there were unsettled loans amounting to Rs100,000. However a kind gentleman from Boralesgamuwa, now living in England, offered to settle the loan and redeem the house on hearing of the achievement of Parami.
Our house is about to collapse. After hearing of my daughters victory in Japan, on an earlier occasion, Minister Sajith Premadasa offered us some assistance to build a house.
My husband goes into sea in a canoe and returns with few fish after struggling for hours. The money earned from selling them does not fetch enough income for a living.
If he has a boat and engine we can overcome these problems. North Western Fisheries Minister Sumal Thisera gave him a new canoe, but it needs an engine.It is very difficult for us to incur the travelling expenses of my daughter as she has to visit Colombo often for training.
When Parami won the Bronze medal she telephoned me and said that she would get the Gold in 2020. But she needs the assistance of people who are affluent, said Rita.

## Title: Premakeerthi de Alwis  For want of a tribute

Premakeerthi de Alwis  For want of a tribute
	
Somewhere in my teenage years, I fell in love with the Sinhala song. Not songs per se, but the idea of the Sinhala geethaya. It was, I thought, unique and utterly different to the tunes I used to listen to over the radio, English, Hindi, or Tamil. And yet, like the meaning of love, it was difficult to put a finger on why, and how, it was so unique and different. Was it because of the composer Couldnt be. The vocalist Surely not. The lyricist Perhaps, but even there, I had my doubts.
What made it more difficult for me to ascertain this was the fact that modern local songs had next to nothing that could distinguish them from the tunes that invaded our airwaves. Over the years, the Sinhala geethaya had become democratised; we have gone from obe neth dutu to oyage lassana as deka dakka.
It was then that I understood that, more than anyone else, it was the lyricist who made the Sinhala geethaya so unique. The uniqueness of the Sinhala lyricist had to do with the distinction, drawn in South Asia, between poetry and song, a distinction between an aesthetic based on the sounds in a language (shabda dhvaniya, for a song) and an aesthetic based on the meanings in a language (artha dhvaniya, for a poem). In both cases, it was language that preceded everything else.
It was not just aesthetic. It was also a rule, which served to discipline the poet and the songwriter in their fields. The latter, moreover, bore a bigger burden; he not only had to convey a feeling or sentiment through words, he also had to ensure that those feelings intermingled with the music. Not an easy task, you must admit.
So I retuned to those lyricists. The songs they had written. The lines that had enthralled me. Some names kept coming back. Mahagama Sekara. Karunaratne Abeysekara. Ajantha Ranasinghe. Premakeerthi de Alwis. Of them, Premakeerthi had written so many songs. It was hard to escape the mans lyrics. Harder to not grow to love them. Even harder to not keep on returning to them.
Lklyrics.com lists down around 80 songs written by him. A poor count. 1,000 would be a more exact figure, though even that can be contested. Whats more important than quantity, however, are the themes he returned to. To get to those themes, it is important to revisit the mans life.
He was born Samaraweera Mudalige Don Premakeerthi de Alwis on June 1947 in Colombo. He was not born to an affluent family. His father was a railway employee. Educated initially at Maligakanda Maha Vidyalaya, he was sent to Ananda College, where he was engaged with the school magazine and other aesthetic activities that in turn got him to guide an entire generation of Anandians who would make their mark in arts, including Kularatne Ariyawansa.
Formative years 
It was during these formative years that he encountered Karunaratne Abeysekara, aboard Lama Pitiya and Lama Mandapaya. More than his poetic skills, it was his voice that would win him audiences. With that voice came a yearning to join Radio Ceylon. He began working there from the latter half of the sixties, after a brief stint at the Dawasa Group (where he wrote feature articles). He became a full time announcer (he had been freelancing) in 1971, and was soon promoted as a programme producer.
When the radio gave way to the television in the eighties, he was eager to shift to the new medium, but found it a difficult route to tread, given that administrators were of the opinion that he did not possess the appropriate looks (especially with his less than awe-inspiring frontal teeth). But these misconceptions gave way, and he soon found himself presenting an array of programmes. A friend of mine recently tried to sum up his career in radio and television for me: I have never heard a more perfect baritone Sinhala voice. Wasantha Rohana, he suggested, came close. But only so close.
That was Premakeerthi the announcer. What of Premakeerthi the versifier
Here are the opening lines to his first song, Hada Pura Asune (composed by Sanath Nandasiri, and performed by his wife Malkanthi and Rupa Indumathi).

Gunadasa Amarasekara wrote somewhere that the problem with the Colombo poets was their inability to go beyond certain clichs. In Mimana Premathilakes poetry, which represents both rebellion against and affirmation of the kind of sentimentalised Victorian verses his contemporaries had swallowed, there is a blend of the risqu and the didactic, rampant with these same clichs, that outraged readers.
Over the years, after the debate over his verses had (almost) died down, a generation of versifiers imbibed the kind of language he resorted to, filled with the rhetoric of love, loneliness, and idealisation of the female figure. To me, the words hada puda asune and jeewana mee bindu represents that language, which Premakeerthi soon embraced and wielded. It was not the language of Sekara or even Ratnayake, of those versifiers who had started out as poets. To be sure, there had been versifiers who had transformed the rhetoric of love into a musical idiom. But it was Premarakeerthi who returned to the Colombo poets for this endeavour, and turned the undercurrents of torment and sorrow in their work into the popular song lyric.
At the same time, Premakeerthi (Prem to his colleagues) was not alone in what he was doing. Karunaratne Abeysekara, Ajantha Ranasinghe, and Sunanda Mahendra before him, and Kularatne Ariyawansa, Sunil Ariyaratne, and Ratna Sri Wijesinghe after him would idealise, if not romanticise, the village and make it more palatable to the dwellers of the city, in verse after verse. Almost all of them had come or would come from the press, as writers and journalists. Contemporary to a fault, they could not quite escape the fusion of the quatrain (sivpadaya) and free verse (nisadas) which even Mahagama Sekara had been entranced by. They were of the village, yes, but they had flirted with the city too, and its mosaic of art forms.
Creating own identity 
What was unique about Premakeerthi was that, while he grew up in the company of these men, he carved his own identity. It was the poetry of love these lyricists resorted to, frequently. Premakeerthi resorted to that poetry too. But there was a difference. 
Intensely personal, insanely poignant, his lyrics are, to me, the ruminations of a soul less concerned with the fact of love than its memory. If Ajantha Ranasinghe, whom I rate very high, wrote of loneliness tempered by the possibility of a brief encounter (Paloswaka Sanda, Mage Lowata, Kunda Saman Mal, and Degoda Thala), and if Kularatne Ariyawansa wrote of the possibility of a love that is requited after being rejected (Aradhana, Seetha Arane, Sudu Muthu Rala Pela, and his debut, Pinibara Malak), Premakeerthi, who followed the one and preceded the other, dwelt on neither acceptance nor rejection, but on the past.
For Ranasinghe, the past was the antidote that kept the hope of love alive. For Ariyawansa, it was a reminder of the ever omniscient possibility of rejection. For Premakeerthi, on the other hand, it was just what it was: the past, a repository of memories that was and is neither painful nor filled with happiness.

<U+0D9C><U+0DD2><U+0DBA> <U+0DC0><U+0DD3><U+0DAF><U+0DD2><U+0DBA><U+0DD9>

<U+0D91><U+0DBD><U+0DCA><U+0DBD><U+0DD3> <U+0D91><U+0DB1><U+0DC0><U+0DCF>

Even at his most joyful, there is an undercurrent of sobriety, a reminder that the past is outside the reach of the lover who has lost and the lover who has reclaimed what he has lost. The future, and with it the possibility of reconciliation are what one can look forward to; they exist outside the periphery of the past. It is the now, and not the hitherto, in other words, that the versifier was concerned with.

<U+0DC3><U+0DD4><U+0DC5><U+200D><U+0D9F><U+0DDA> <U+0DB1><U+0DBD><U+0DC0><U+0DCF>

<U+0DB1><U+0DDC><U+0DBB><U+0DD0><U+0DB3><U+0DD3> <U+0D9C><U+0DBD><U+0DCF>

When he let abandoned the rhetoric of love and, with Freddie Silva, took on society in the most didactic way he could, he retained this quality. The didacticism of a song like Boru Kakul Karaya and Handa Mama is firmly rooted in the present; the poet is less worried about past omissions than the situation his characters are in.

<U+0DC4><U+0DB3> <U+0DB8><U+0DCF><U+0DB8><U+0DCF> <U+0D8B><U+0DA9><U+0DD2><U+0DB1><U+0DCA> <U+0DBA><U+0DAD><U+0DDA>
<U+0D85><U+0DB4><U+0DDA> <U+0DB8><U+0DCF><U+0DB8><U+0DCF> <U+0DB6><U+0DD2><U+0DB8><U+0DD2><U+0DB1><U+0DCA> <U+0DBA><U+0DAD><U+0DDA>

When Premakeerthi did resort to the past, it was to evoke memory, something which could never resurrect the present, so much so that we could only look back and say, We can never reclaim it, but only regret it. Consolation, for him, seemed to come from the present, the moment, and it compensated for everything else.

<U+0DB1><U+0DDC><U+0DB4><U+0DD2><U+0DBB><U+0DD4><U+0DAB><U+0DD4> <U+0DB8><U+0DDA>
<U+0DC3><U+0DD2><U+0DAD><U+0DA7> <U+0DB8><U+0D9C><U+0DDA>
<U+0D94><U+0DB6> <U+0D9C><U+0DD9><U+0DB1> <U+0D91><U+0DBA><U+0DD2>
<U+0DC3><U+0DAD><U+0DD4><U+0DA7> <U+0D85><U+0D9C><U+0DDA>

Our first real lyricists went to the wellsprings of our way of life, to evoke, and idealise, a rural arcadia which modernity would do away with. After them, we saw Mahagama Sekara, who, after wrestling with the present, and idealising the past, learnt (as Maknisada Yath showed) to accept that present.
The lyricists who followed these men were, for obvious reasons, caught up in an encounter between the hitherto and hereafter, and they found ways of tackling it. Memory, that most potent symbol of the past, figured in their verses. Premakeerthi had his own way of battling it: not by idealising it, nor by forgetting it, but by depicting it for what it was: a repository of the past.

Priest who spoke against Bishop Franco found dead
	

Hindustan Times (Thiruvananthapuram), Oct 22, 2018 - Senior priest Father Kuriakose Kattuthara who had testified against former Jalandhar Bishop Franco Mulakkal accused of raping a nun, was found dead Monday morning, reports said. 
His family said they suspected foul play. 
His brother Jose Kattuthara, told local news channels that church authorities called this morning and informed him that his brother was found dead in his room which had been locked from inside. 
Church officials reportedly told the priests brother that Fr. Kattuththara possibly died of a heart attack. 
But Jose Kattuthara remains suspicious. He said he would be filing a complaint and will move the Kerala High Court to cancel Bishop Mulakkals bail. Father Kuriakose Kattuthara had claimed that there were attempts by the church to hush up the sexual assault complaint of the nun against Bishop Mulakkal of Jalandhar diocese.

As a National Government comprising two parties with different ideologies, it is bound to be hit by convulsions occasionally. On political issues, there can be some divergence. What is important is not to have a conflict when it comes to the economic and financial management of the state. The President and the Prime Minister are answerable to their party men. It is inevitable that disagreements occur when it comes to issues regarding infrastructure development and so on. That is in sharing the credit. We had the same experience when we had the Cohabitation Government under former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga between 2002 and 2004. That was quite different. The United National Party (UNP) managed to have the majority in Parliament.
For this Government, after the setback at the Local Government Elections, there appears to be a new tendency. There are many fathers connected to the victory, but the loss is an orphan. Politicians try to distance themselves from the electoral setback. All these have compounded the present crisis. We need a more mature approach to governance. 
Q Actually, the Tamil and Muslim parties worked hard to unseat the previous rule. In retrospect, what do you feel about your action as a leader of a Muslim party
In one aspect, we feel vindicated. That is the aspect related to our security. True enough, the incidents in Ampara and Digana dented that feeling about security. That was of course a colossal failure of the law and order machinery. It was a failure of our intelligence agencies to take timely action. As for the past regime, it was a deliberate disregard. That is what angered the minorities more during that period. In the afterglow of war victory, the former establishment went on to create a feeling of insecurity among the majority by bringing in unfounded fear on various issues. Then, the minorities felt that there were  continual threats to the places of religious worship. There were sustained attacks on the places of religious worship, orchestrated by xenophobic forces. 
Q Does it mean that the present Government, albeit its shortcomings, is still better than the former regime
Yes, of course. You cannot deny that. At least we have a say. When we raise something, the leaders at least listen to us. They want swift action. True enough, it is somewhat late. The law enforcement is more vigorous. They are fearlessly implementing the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) and containing hate speech. Hate crime and hate speech did not have that kind of response in the past. The state machinery has to be more robust in handling hate crimes. If you try to handle it with velvet gloves, it will not do. The former Government handled it with velvet gloves. That was the fault in
their approach.
Q But, you warned about the present Government at a party meeting. If you are happy with the Government, why are you issuing warnings against it
I was critical of the issues regarding minority interests being taken for granted in matters like electoral reforms. My attack on the Government came about because of the mixed electoral reforms being forced on us. After the results of the February 10 elections, everybody realised that the mixed model has complicated the entire system. Still, a section of the Government insists that they must retain the new system. The UNP and the Joint Opposition want to return to the old system. The Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) is insisting that they must retain the new system. Such issues have disappointed us. We have been talking about it quite openly.
Q In case the Government does not listen to you, what would be your next move
I have not got the feeling that the Government would not listen to me. I am pretty certain that everybody realises that the new electoral system is fraught with so many contradictions and that they cannot sustain this. Motivation is not to retain the system. There is a lack of confidence at the moment in going for elections. That is a foolhardy thing in my opinion.
QThere are talks about an Interim Government. Do you fear that the current Government will be toppled
Not at all. From the outset I felt that it was not a move which would succeed. I was privy to certain sections in the Joint Opposition not wanting to rock the boat. We were quite certain that it was not going to happen. They wanted to create certain convulsions. They wanted to expose some people who were sitting on the fence. That was a gain for them.
Nobody should be in a haste or hurry. Even former Minister Basil Rajapaksa said that he was not in favour of forming a Government merely through the manoeuvre of the MPs from one side to another. It is easier to form Governments through defections. It is more prudent to go for a popular movement to topple the Government. There is a sharp difference of opinion within the opposition ranks.
Q You are seen as a political leader who senses the direction of political winds. What direction is the political wind blowing in at the moment
(Laughs) You need not be a prophet to forecast issues in the country. What is more important is to try and market what you have done for the people. The failure to market what you are doing sufficiently has caused most of the setbacks for this Government. We have failed in this aspect. At the same time, we are criticising each other.
QWhat are the things you have done, but failed to market properly
In my Ministry alone, we have now implemented a large number of projects. They are not getting the due publicity. People prefer sensational news. The media too is looking for sensationalism. When they see some infighting and bickering, they put a spin and blow it out of proportion.
For instance, look at the amount of legislations we have made in favour of good governance or the way the power of executive presidency is pruned. It is good for governance.

Present Govt. is better than former rule as far as security is concerned
	UNP should revive itself
	Of course, Gotabaya is a popular candidate
	The state machinery has to be more robust in handling hate crimes
	You need not be a prophet to forecast issues in the country

Q What direction is the political wind blowing in
The Government still has time for course correction. We need to do some tangible work at the grassroots level. The programmes such as Gamperaliya, Enterprise Sri Lanka and Grama Sakthi are trying to take development to the grassroots level. It is the right way to go. It is a bottom up approach. Job creation in the state sector is not the answer for unemployment. It is my observation that the UNP-led Governments are always wary of this matter. It was quite different during the former rule, though. They were doling out state sector employments. Rural people sometimes see it as the strength of the Government. We need to increase the efficiency of the state sector. This Government has to resort to certain unpopular measures. Initially, they tried to reform the pension scheme. They have put it on hold due to resistance. You ambitiously start something and withdraw from it suddenly. If you need to improve efficiency, certain reforms should be done. You cannot be fidgeting with reforms. You need to have strong political will to go through it. Though it is a National Government, there is uneasy cohabitation. It fails to live up to the expectations of aNational Government.
Q Whats your opinion of the next presidential election
Some have already thrown their hats into the ring. But, there is so much uncertainty. Everybody expected that the constitutional reform process would become a reality. They thought that the Executive Presidency would be replaced with the Westminster model. Constitutional reforms cannot be a piecemeal exercise. We have done it once.
The 19th Amendment is a limited exercise. It has been an achievement. We who represent the minority communities expect an overhaul change of
the Constitution. 
Q Is the Constitution making process realistic
If any constitution making process is not completed within six months or one year, it will get embroiled in a crisis. 
Q Some say that the parties and the political forces that were together during the last election in 2015 should continue to be under one umbrella. Do you agree with this view
We too are of the same opinion. We should be able to achieve our objectives. We should have a clear direction. We should not change focus just because some of the moves are being opposed by the so called nationalist forces. We need to have substantial political reforms in order to address grievances. We should not live with the false hope that development will make people forget their rights issues. Rights issues are very potent.
Q If the Presidential Elections are held, whom would you support
We believe the same forces should be there. The President and the Prime Minister must find a way to stay together if we are to remain relevant in the present day politics. The UNP, with a strong candidacy, can challenge anyone at any time. It may be a little too early for us to make a prediction. At a nation-wide election, you need to instill enthusiasm among your rank and file. The UNP should revive itself.
Q What do you think of the possible candidacy of Gotabaya Rajapaksa representing the other side
Gotabaya is a poplar candidate. There is no doubt about it. But, he is not as popular as Mahinda Rajapaksa. Of course, he carries some baggage.
We have to see whether he is genuinely prepared to shedthis baggage.

Reveal names of Cabinet ministers in RAW pay list-Namal
	
Joint Opposition MP Namal Rajapaksa said that President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe should reveal the names of the two cabinet ministers, who were claimed to be in the pay list of Indias Intelligence wing  RAW.
If some cabinet ministers are in the pay list of the RAW, its not only a national issue, but it affects internationally as well. So the President and the Prime Ministers responsibility are to expose them, he said addressing an event in Lunugamvehera.
The President had revealed that RAW had given a contract to kill him (President). When the Indian media reported it, the Presidents office denied it. But now Minister Mahinda Amaraweera says that there are two agents of RAW in the Cabinet. So there should be a connection about both statements, he said adding that, considering these statements, there must be some truth about these things.
He also said that if The Hindu newspaper was taking the responsibility about the story, it is the duty of the Prime Minister to investigate into these claims and reveal the truth as soon as possible. (Dilip Jayasekera- Suriyawewa)

Rs. 6.4mn worth forex seized from portable HDD at BIA
	
A Sri Lankan national had been arrested yesterday at the BIA with Rs.6.4 mn worth foreign currency notes including Sri Lankan Rupees (LKR) concealed inside a Portable Hard Disk Drive (HDD), Deputy Director and Acting Spokesman Vipula Minuwanpitiya said.
Speaking to the Daily Mirror he said the HDD was among his other goods, while he was attempting to smuggle out to Singapore.
The suspect who was a resident of Nugegoda holds a platinum privilege card from the airline he used to travel frequently to Singapore.
He was identified himself as a partner of a small business.

The foreign currency was detected after the goods went through the scanner and finally the Customs Officers decided to open the HDD and look into it, he said.
Mr Minuwanpitiya said according to the amendments made to the Customs Act, foreign currencies, including the local currency, would be confiscated and no fines were imposed on the suspect.
Further investigations were carried out under the directive of Customs Additional Director General Stanley Senarathne, Customs Director M.A Karunarathne, Deputy Directors V Minuvanpitiya, S.P. Kiriwaththuduwa and Customs Superintendents D.W.K Wijethunga and M.I.M Ismail. (Chaturanga Samarawickrama)

Russia warns of countermeasures as US plans pull-out from nuke treaty
	

DPA, 22nd OCTOBER, 2018- The US withdrawing from the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty would require Russia to undertake measures to ensure its security, the Kremlin warned on Monday.
If the US develops intermediate-range nuclear weapons, then Russia would have to follow suit, to restore the balance, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said in comments carried by media.
US President Donald Trump announced over the weekend that the US was pulling out of the deal on an accusation that Russia had violated it.
The US has said Russia breached the treaty by developing the Novator 9M729 cruise missile, estimated to have a range of 2,600 kilometres. The treaty, signed between the United States and the then-Soviet Union in 1987, had sought to restrict nuclear-armed missiles with a range up to 5,500 kilometres. Peskov rejected accusations that Russia could have violated the deal, saying: Russia has been and remains committed to the provisions of this agreement, according to comments carried by state news agency TASS. Russia has alleged that the Western military alliance NATO could have violated the deal with a missile shied in Romania that Russia says has the capability of launching a nuclear missile at any time.

Seven civilians die in explosion after J&K encounter
	

Hindustan Times(Srinagar), Oct 22, 2018 - Seven civilians were killed in Kashmirs Kulgam in an explosion at the site of a gun battle between militants and security forces after the encounter ended with the death of the three Jaish-e-Mohammed members, the police said. 
Police spokesperson Manoj Kumar said the civilians were killed by stray explosives after they rushed to the encounter site, despite a warning by security forces. Locals earlier arrived at the spot and began shouting slogans and throwing stones at the troops after they heard about the ongoing encounter, the police said. 
The three militants were killed in a house after the gunfight broke out early on Sunday after security forces began a cordon-and-search operation following reports of the presence of militants in Laroo village. The police said once the firing stopped, local residents went too close to the encounter site before security forces could sanitise the area. 
Kumar said civilians had been advised to stay away from the spot. They didnt listen and visited the spot immediately after the forces withdrew... Some explosive substance went off resulting in injuries to civilians, the spokesperson said.

Situ in SL will improve by National New Year, 2019
	
The situation in Sri Lanka will turn for the better by next year's National New Year, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said yesterday.
He said this at a ceremony held at Temple Trees where appointment letters were handed over to 370 new Grama Niladaris. The ceremony was organized by the Ministry of Home Affairs.
We had a debt issue till recently and we have resolved it to a great extent even amid criticism. Then the country was hit by a drought. New we are faced with the global economic crisis with an increase in the price of fuel and the strengthening of the dollar. We can face these situations as well with the situation improving by the 2019 National New Year, the Prime Minister said. Sri Lanka could have faced the global economic crisis better if we had an export-driven economy. However, our foreign reserves are sufficient to face any crises."
He said government was able to launch more than 100,000 development projects at grassroots level and pointed out that it was for the first time that so many projects had been launched. There are shortcomings in our programmes and I request the relevant officers to resolve them, the Premier said and added that funds should be provided to farmers in drought-hit areas so that they could start work now that there was rains in those areas.
Home Affairs Minister Wajira Abeywardene said public servants including the newly appointed Grama Niladaris could not work independently. He said they were duty-bound to implement government policies at grassroots level.
The late President had to remove more than 100,000 public servants because of a grave issue during his time. However, this government will make sure that public servants are properly advised and guided in performing their duties, he said. "You will be dealt under the Establishment Code while we politicians will be judged by the people when our term ends." The minister said Grama Niladaries will be located in  Nila Sevana offices which will be jointly used by the agriculture officers and economic development officers
Public Administration Minister Ranjith Madduma Bandara said Grama Niladaries who function at grassroots level are important components in the state machinery because they are the ones who implement government policies. This government has given the needed boost to public servants with a Rs.10,000 salary increase, he said. (Yohan Perera)

SL is the best travel destination for 2019 - Lonely Planet
	
Sri Lanka claimed the top spot in the Lonely Planets best travel destinations list of countries to visit in 2019, with Germany and Zimbabwe just behind, while Italy's Piedmont, the Catskills in the USA, and northern Peru topped the list of must-see regions.
Egypts Southern Nile Valley, Lodz in Poland and the USAs Great Smoky Mountains were named as the three best-value destinations for 2019.
Sri Lanka came top in the list of best countries to visit primarily because travel has become much easier there since the civil war ended in 2009.
It's changed so much, so quickly, and in a lot of ways that makes travel much easier, said Matt Philips, destination editor at Lonely Planet. During the civil war there were large tracts in the north that were completely off limits, but now there are new road and rail links, and new internal flights.
'Sri Lanka, is decidedly having its moment in the equatorial sun and change is coming swiftly. After decades of civil conflict, this is a country revived. 'There's more than ever for families, adrenaline junkies, eco-tourists, wellness seekers and foodies of all budgets.'
He also said travel products had hugely evolved in Sri Lanka, and now includes diverse opportunities beyond mere beach holidays, from eco-tourism and yoga retreats to visiting national parks to see elephants and leopards.
It's also great for foodies  Sri Lanka has everything, Philips added.

If they were given this total at toss, they'd not believe it. But now that they've got it, they got to believe it. Courtesy of some brilliant exhibition of batting, the Lankans have managed to put up a match winning total.
If they can't win this, they can win nothing. Harsh but true. Although the pitch looks a belter for batting, the hosts have few mystery spinners in their armory. Not going to be easy for England, this chase. Be right back with it. (Cricbuzz)

Accordingly, hereafter, companies or exporters in Sri Lanka can send goods in any number worth maximum of US $ 3000 each, without submitting a CUSDEC application to Sri Lanka Customs.
However, at the end of the particular month, the exporter has to submit one CUSDEC application to Sri Lanka Customs covering all transactions, a Finance and Mass Media Ministry statement said.

 Soon after a rumour going viral that she is grooming to enter the fray at the upcoming provincial polls, some local body members have begun following her like faithful dogs and falling over each other to attend to her personal needs.
Whenever she attends a religious ceremony at a Buddhist temple these days, there would be a member or two to look after the footwear she would leave at the entrance to the precincts. If she happened to leave the precincts through a different entrance after the ceremony, some member would consider it a privilege to rush to where she is, carrying the footwear she has left behind, they say.

Two Koreas, US-led UN Command meet again
	

SEOUL, South Korea (Daily Mail), 22 October 2018- Military officers from the two Koreas and the U.S.-led U.N. Command met again at the Koreas border village Monday to examine an ongoing effort to disarm the area. 
Demilitarizing the Panmunjom village inside the Koreas heavily fortified border was among many agreements the Koreas struck in September to lower military tensions between the rivals. 
Under the deals, troops from the Koreas began clearing mines from Panmunjom earlier this month before withdrawing weapons and guard posts there. They eventually plan to have 35 unarmed personnel from each side guard the village. 
Mondays trilateral talks are the second in kind in about a week. Officially, the village is jointly overseen by North Korea and the U.N. Command, a legacy of the 1950-53 Korean War that ended with an armistice, not a peace treaty. 
The talks are to review the demining work and discussing future steps in the area, South Koreas Defense Ministry said in a statement.

## Title: UNP-SLFP domestic rivalry threatens to distort foreign policy

UNP-SLFP domestic rivalry threatens to distort foreign policy
	

That India played the most pernicious role of a destabilizer of independent Sri Lanka is an incontrovertible empirical fact. That phase of overt Indian interference, which saw arming and training of nascent Tamil separatists and then the parippu drop and the induction of Indian peace keepers lasted less than a decade. However the monsters that India helped create haunted this country for three decades, robbed us two generations of prosperity, and a hundred thousand lives. 
This is not uniquely our plight. A cursory glance of Indias relationship with its neighbours, Bhutan, Bangladesh and Nepal, would reveal that India has expected them to subordinate their national interest to New Delhis strategic interest. In each of these countries, India made a big mess. Though now it is trying hard to amend its course, and address the image problem, old habits die hard.
Indias overblown geo-strategic interests in its sphere of influence and peace and prosperity of small and medium size states therein are not necessarily mutually inclusive. India has a skewed relationship between relative limits of its actual material resources and enlarged geo-strategic interests it inherited from the British Raj. This asymmetry is better defended, and cost efficiently so, when the regional states are weak and in trouble. When they are in peace, other regional players step in- and Indias resource limits and opportunity cost of domestic trade- offs make it difficult for it to keep up with those competitors. That is what India is experiencing in the context of Chinas economic expansion.
No wonder that some Indian analysts are publicly complaining that the Congress government had compromised Indias most formidable leverage on Sri Lanka by letting Colombo to finish off the LTTE once and for all.
In this backdrop, it is perfectly logical for Sri Lankans - or South Asians for that matter - to have a healthy dose of skepticism. However, getting paranoid by their big neighbour is a folly and is counter- productive. Going to town with unsubstantiated allegations makes things worse. Instead, they should all be reasons to devise means for proactive engagement with India and give it an economic stake. So that New Delhi would have a self- interest in Sri Lankas stability.
Last week at the Cabinet briefing, President Maithripala Sirisena reportedly alleged that Research and Analysis Wing (RAW), Indias intelligence agency, was plotting to kill him. He added that it might be acting without the knowledge of PM Modi. He was referring to a revelation by self-styled anti-corruption buster Nalaka Kumara, who had alleged that the former TID Director, DIG Nalaka Silva sought his assistance to assassinate the president. He has since claimed that an Indian national has threatened to kill him. The Indian national, whom the Indian embassy has described as mentally unstable was later arrested by the police. He is now in remand custody. The Presidents remarks made headlines following day. Most importantly, it was picked up by the influential The Hindu newspaper. Its correspondent Meera Srinivasan has said that she had verified the report with four cabinet ministers. The presidents media division later denied that the president had implicated RAW in the alleged allegation plot. However, notwithstanding the denial, unfound allegations unleashed a whirlpool of diplomatic activity to salvage the bilateral partnership. The president later telephoned PM Modi to clarify his remarks, after which a rather bland press statement was issued by the presidents office, effectively telling the people, everything is just fine. In a separate statement, the office of Premier Modi echoed same sentiments. The Prime Ministers Office (in New Delhi) declared: The President of Sri Lanka stated that he categorically rejected the reports in sections of media about him alluding to the involvement of India in any manner whatsoever in an alleged plot to assassinate the President and a former Defence Secretary of Sri Lanka.
However, another statement issued by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghes office after his meet up with Indian PM in New Delhi last week was a spoiler. The press release stated, Modi expressed disappointment over the delay in the Indian funded projects. It added, Premier Modi said, he had spent the most of his time allocated to diplomatic matters, on Sri Lanka, and expressed his discontent over the response of the Sri Lankan government towards the assistance given by India.
It added, that Modi said that if there was any hint of any problem, it should be broached to him or India without hesitation.
This flew in the face of the two previous statements by the offices of Messers. Sirisena and Modi. That also contradicted a diplomatically worded press statement issued by Indias Ministry of External Affairs about the meeting between the two prime ministers. The Indian statement said the main item on the agenda was a review of the progress in Indian projects.
This brings out another element that has been holding back this government from evolving a unified position on anything: simmering disagreement between the President and PM, which has progressively worsened since the local government elections.
Now, disturbingly, these petty politically calculated animosities are spilling into foreign policy. Interestingly, the presidents remarks on the RAW came in the context of a wider disagreement over the handing over of the development of Eastern terminal of the Colombo Port to a joint Indian-Japanese and Sri Lankan venture. The President vehemently opposed the proposal, claiming that giving ports to the foreign entities would leave Sri Lanka without a port to berth its own ships.
There is an ideological divide between the lifelong SLFP stalwart Maithripala Sirisena and more economically liberal minded UNP. However, that divide has been deepened by politically calculated rhetorical posturing, especially on foreign direct investment.That has effectively dissipated the investor enthusiasm. Sovereignty concerns are cited as justification for opposing many such public-private partnership projects involving foreign entities. But, the blunt truth is that more often than not, it is electoral calculations of economic nationalism that are at play. Sri Lanka has lost a good deal due to this already. 
Now to make matters worse, the countrys foreign policy has also been dragged into this no-hold -barred contest. Granted that economic development through international cooperation dilutes the absolute notion of sovereignty. Such concerns could well be heightened in an asymmetric relationship where big powers take a stake. However, such partnerships also entail immense benefits to the host country. They increase connectivity, bring in much needed capital, and technology, and facilitate the economic catch- up of countries whose development has been held back by misplaced statism of economic policy. Thus the real challenge is to engage in a rational trade off of opportunities and threats. However, the internecine rivalry within the unity government, especially between the President and the UNP, is adding too much raw emotions, and opportunism to the discourse. That distorts the whole picture. 
Sri Lankas real danger has always been within. That is its opportunistic politics. In the past, divisive ethno-nationalism of primarily of Tamils and advanced by the Tamil political elites exposed this country to foreign, mainly Indian influence and intervention. Now the two main Sinhalese parties have taken it to a new low. They are dabbling their political calculations in the countrys relationship with both India and China. They should learn from the mistakes of recent history and desist from this dangerous gamble.

US provides Rs.600 million for mine clearance in SL
	
The US Department of State has provided nearly Rs. 600 million ($3.5 million) in assistancetowards Sri Lankas demining efforts thisyear, the US Embassy said today.

Voice cuts match Nalaka de Silva's voice: GA
	
CID today informed the Fort Chief Magistrate that the Government Analyst had identified 123 voice cuts as those of ex-DIG Nalaka de Silva from the 124 recordings sent to the Government Analyst.
He had also detected the voice cuts to be tampered by attaching a software device to the complainants mobile phone.
The CID said efforts made by them to rectify the deletions had failed.
Meanwhile, the mobile phone manufacturer in Hong Kong had assured the CID that they re-marry the deleted parts of the recordings and as such the CID sought Court permission to send the mobile phone to Hong Kong for examination.
The CID said the two CDs given to the CID by Namal Kumara had been sent to the GA and were awaiting a response.
CID Chief Inspector Ranjith Munasinghe told the Magistrate that their investigations had revealed that Anti-Corruption Unit's director Namal Kumara, the complainant in this case, was an air force deserter who had later joined the Army and thereafter had worked in the Avant Guarde Security Services headed by Nissanka Senadipathy.
Counsel Ajith Pathirana appearing for Nalaka de Silva told the Magistrate that according to GAs report the recordings of the conversation had been tampered and in such an event could not be used as evidence against his client because a tampered recording could not be considered as an original recording.
The Magistrate directed the Government Analyst to file a report on the questionnaire send to him by Court report his findings on the CDs sent to him for examination.
Meanwhile the CID directed Nalaka Silva to report to the CID to record another statement. (T. Farook Thajudeen)

Watching this film, a must for them!
	

Some school Principals have come under pressure to arrange for their children to watch a certain film produced by a coterie with political interests, they say.

A Principal of a school in the Colombo District, excited by an order coming from above, is said to be collecting Rs. 150 from each child to hire a bus to take them to the cinema hall.
Poor parents are reportedly complaining that they cannot afford to show films to their children when they have to make a struggle to give them a square meal a day.

World's longest sea crossing: Hong Kong-Zhuhai bridge opens
	
Chinese President Xi Jinping has officially opened the world's longest sea crossing bridge, nine years after construction first began.
Including its access roads, the bridge spans 55km (34 miles) and connects Hong Kong to Macau and the mainland Chinese city of Zhuhai.
The bridge has cost about $20bn (15.3bn) and seen several delays.
Construction has been dogged by safety issues - at least 18 workers have died on the project, officials say.
Mr Xi attended the opening ceremony of the bridge which took place in Zhuhai along with the leaders of Hong Kong and Macau on Tuesday.
The bridge will open to regular traffic on Wednesday.
The crossing connects three key coastal cities in southern China - Hong Kong, Macau and Zhuhai.
The bridge, designed to withstand earthquakes and typhoons, was built using 400,000 tonnes of steel, enough to build 60 Eiffel Towers.
About 30km of its total length crosses the sea of the Pearl River delta. To allow ships through, a 6.7km section in the middle dips into an undersea tunnel that runs between two artificial islands.
The remaining sections are link roads, viaducts and land tunnels connecting Zhuhai and Hong Kong to the main bridge.
It is part of China's plan to create a Greater Bay Area, including Hong Kong, Macau and nine other cities in southern China.
In the past, travelling between Zhuhai and Hong Kong would take up to four hours - the new bridge cuts this down to 30 minutes. (BBC)
