Abans Finance puts up strong performance in March quarter
	
Ups PBT by 51%; PAT up 48%
Beefs up capital adequacy?
Abans Finance, a member of the Abans Group, has registered a pre-tax profit of?Rs.197.4 million for the period ended 31st March 2017, compared to Rs.130.5 million recorded in the corresponding year of 2016, achieving a YoY growth of 51.29 percent.?
The post?tax profit of the company for the period under review has also improved by 48.2 percent, from Rs.90.1 million in 2016 to Rs.133.6 million in 2017.
The Abans Group consists of a large diversified set of companies and divisions overlooking the sales and financing of consumer durables/household appliances, motor vehicles, environmental services, logistics, hospitality and finance. The Abans Group places a strong emphasis on customer care and focuses on the paradigm of ?Customer for life?.?
Abans Finance has also enhanced its stated capital from Rs.382.3 million to Rs.844 million during 2016/17 and further to Rs. 1,121.4 million during the current financial year of 2018. Ironwood Investment Holding (Pvt) Limited has invested in Abans Finance and currently holds 41.89 percent equity of the company with the conclusion of the mandatory offer closed in July 2017. Ironwood is a private equity firm that successfully raised a Sri Lanka-focused Private Equity fund of up to US$ 30 million in long-term (8-year) capital commitments.?
The company has continued to increase its profitability amidst external challenges such as increasing interest rates and slowdown in consumption. The increase in profitability was mainly due to favourable growth in net interest income.
Fund based income (FBI): A slight shrinking of Net Interest Margins (NIM) had an adverse impact on the Net Interest Income (NII) of the entire NBFI sector and Abans Finance was no exception to this trend. ?Nevertheless, NII of the company recorded a remarkable increase of?
Rs. 162.98million or 23 percent during the period under review from Rs.708 million in 2016 to Rs. 871 million in 2017, aided by the significant expansion of the asset-base of the company since 2016, coupled with prudent liability management strategies.
Non-fund based income (NFBI): Net fee and Commission income which mostly comprises of fees, commissions and other fee based income decreased to Rs.19.4 million from being Rs. 34.7 million during the year 2016, reflecting a decline of 44.2 percent. The company introduced a number of unique value additions to its Hero Motor cycle leasing offerings during the period under review in order to remain competitive in view of the fact that most competitors have now made moves to the two wheeler motor cycle credit market to retain margins in a period of rising interest costs.?
A 22.5 percent growth was recorded in other operating income for the period under review as compared to the corresponding period in 2016. Other operating income earned during the year 2017 amounted to Rs. 20.7 million, whereas in 2016it was Rs. 16.9 million.?
Operating expenses: Operating expenses of the company which stood at Rs. 372.6 million for the yearof 2016, increased to Rs. 470 million during the year of 2016, reflecting a YoY increase of 26.1 percent. This increase was mainly due to the rise in personnel costs. The Cost to Income ratio without VAT and NBT on Financial Services in 2017 has increased to 51.5 percent from 49.0 percent recorded in the previous year. The company expects to gain the benefits of the business expansion in the coming years and intends to improve on this ratio.?
Impairment loss on loan and receivables: The impairment charge on loans and receivables for the year 2017 amounted to Rs. 189.3 million which is a decrease of Rs. 36.4 million as compared to Rs. 225.8 million impairment charges recorded for the previous year. Recently implemented portfolio monitoring mechanisms including both single loan level monitoring and overall portfolio level monitoring improved the portfolio quality, which in turn supported the reduction of impairment charges during the year. ??
Business growth: The year 2017 exposed the company to a challenging environment caused by intense competition, increasing funding costs coupled with the resultant pressure on NIM. Despite these challenges, the company?s total asset base grew by 21.8 percent during the year and stood at Rs. 7,486.2 million as at 31stMarch 2017. The loans and receivables also increased by 21.8 percent during the year to Rs. 5,825.6 million as at 31stMarch 2017. The total deposits showed a growth of 22.3 percent during the year to record a figure of Rs. 5,550.5 million as at the balance sheet date.
Performance ratios: ROE (after tax) declined to 14.64 percent as at 31st March 2017 compared to 15.82 percent recorded as of 31st March 2016 while ROA (before tax) improved to 1.96 percent compared to 1.65 percent recorded in 2016. The Basic Earnings per share for the year 2017improved to Rs.2.75compared to Rs.2.29recorded for the previous year reflecting a growth of 20 percent.
Capital adequacy: The Capital Adequacy Ratio improved during the year under review and was supported by an equity infusion of Rs. 461.7 million (by way of Rights Issue and a Private Placement) and by improvement in internally generated reserves. The total Risk Weighted Capital Adequacy Ratio was at 19.37 percent compared to 11.59 percent in 2016 and whereas the Core Capital Ratio stood at 19.41 percent compared to 11.59 percent in 2016, making Abans Finance one of the highest capitalized companies in the NBFI Sector. The sector total Risk Weighted Capital Adequacy Ratio and the Core Capital Ratio records at 11.82 percent and 11.31 percent respectively.?
Diversity in product offerings and collections: The company has also diversified its lending to include leasing for 4 wheeler business, business loans, and personal loans. Plans are under way to include and integrate technology to further add convenience and products for customers. The company has a branch/service channel network of 23 centers in addition to over 400 collections points spread throughout the country, giving itself the largest collection network in the industry.

An ?Aloysius? behind H?tota port agreement: PHU
	
The Pivithuru Hela Urumaya (PHU) yesterday said the Hambantota Port agreement signed with the China Merchant Company was corrupt and that it was evident an ?Aloysius? was behind this deal.
It said a five-member committee had reviewed two proposals, one more favourable than the other, submitted by two companies to lease out the port but the government had opted to the least profitable agreement.
?The China Merchant Company agreed to provide US$ 1,888 million to the government for 99 years whereas the China Harbour Company had agreed to give US$ 3,281 million for only 50 years. China Merchant doesn?t give one third of the revenue of China Harbour for 99 years. Therefore, its evident that there is an ?Aloysius? behind this agreement. We will be able to expose all details near future.? PHU General Secretary MP Udaya Gammanpila told a news briefing.
He said others advised them not to provoke China, which will become a world powerhouse in future, when the former government members pledged to publicise the port under one of their governments.
?The LTTE was considered as unbeatable but former President Mahinda Rajapaksa eliminated them. Vietnam defeated the US armies. The most important incident is Panama owning the rights of Panama Canal after going against the US for three decades. If we adopt the corect method, we can defeat powerhouses,? the MP said.
While rejecting reports that the port was operated under heavy loses, he said it had continued to collect a generous profit till 2016 and had comfortably paid back installments of the loan obtained to construct the port.
He said the revenue obtained from signing the deal would not be utilized to settle the loan and that the amount of debt of the country would remain unchanged. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

Bank of Ceylon celebrates 78 years of unparalleled service to the nation
	
With the confidence and trust that has been build over the years in the Sri Lankan banking and financial services sector, the country?s No.1 brand steps into its successful 78th year of service as ?Banker?s to the nation? on August 1st.?
?Having to celebrate 78 years of being the No.1 bank in the Sri Lankan banking industry is an extraordinary tale to tell. Since the bank?s inception in 1939 to assist the Sri Lankans to come out of the difficult situation that prevailed at that time depriving locals from obtaining financial assistance reasonably, the bank has been committed to socio-economic development through financial inclusion, providing genuinely value-added services to those who seek reliable and convenient financial solutions and the overall upliftment of ?the country?s banking and financial landscape to align it with international banking standards.??
The Bank of Ceylon?s Chairman, Ronald C. Perera said, ?I take this opportunity to thank all our beloved customers to whom we owe our success and our main stakeholder the Government of Sri Lanka for the direction, finally to all stakeholders and all Sri Lankans in general.? he further added.
A state council member George E De Silva spearheaded a demand which led to the calling for the establishment of a state aided bank. The inauguration took place at No. 41 Bristol Street, Colombo Fort on 1st August 1939 with the patronage of the British Governor Sir Andrew Caldecott. Just as it addressed the need of that time for a commercial bank for people of this country, the Bank still proudly upholds same core values that were transmitted by its founders to be a leader of positive economic change and a passionate banking service provider.?
With the mission to enable growth and progress for all its customers the BOC has been evolving with the needs and lifestyles of the Sri Lankan community in providing the financial assistance they require. As such the brand ?BOC? was recognized as the No.1 Bank and No.1 Brand in the country among all other brands in the country valued for the 9th consecutive year by the Brand Finance Lanka (lk) the affiliated Sri Lankan body of the Brand Finance UK. The first and the only Sri Lankan single business entity to earn Profit Before Tax (PBT) of Rs.25.3 Billion for 2015 and PBT 31.6 Billion for 2016, BOC has frequently challenged its own record continuing its quest to strive for exceptional performance in all areas of banking.
??We know that every step we take to re-modify and transform our banking processes has the effect of providing greater value to Sri Lankans at large. Addressing this concern at all times the Bank continuously maintains and enhances its services to suit the changing lifestyle of Sri Lankans. This is the best moment to reiterate our promise to all Sri Lankans that we will continue to provide excellence in banking and contribute to the country?s social and economic development as the undisputed banking financial leader in Sri Lanka,? said General Manager D.M. Gunasekera.?
In more recent times, innovative steps and out-of-the-box thinking has enabled BOC to grow stronger and strengthen the country?s economic resources. The digital inclusive transformation that the Bank brought forward to re-furbish the brand image went on board in 2015 ensuring long-term sustainability of the Bank. It responded to the current market needs and translated them into banking products and services that capture a wider spectrum of customers including youth and provides them with confidence and the convenience of banking thus altogether changing the customer interface of the bank completely. The transformation focused on product bundling, relationship management, data sharing and building a 360 degree customer view, sophisticated customer segmentation, real-time transaction and cross selling, multi-channel seamless transaction modes and automated customer care.?
Being a brand with a stake in the country and its people, it ensured the roll-out of the process island-wide to benefit customers. Among the new technologies that were widely introduced to enhance the customer interface with the bank during this transformation are, the cash deposit machines that came together with the ?SmartZone? concept which is a 24-hour operative customer touch point, Branch-on-wheels (the mobile branch), introduction of social media- Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, tri-language website with online loan application facility and Youtube as novel communication tools for the Bank to interact with customers.
The multi-faceted services are the greatest strength of BOC. From the children?s savings account to corporate credit, for state sector and private organisations, BOC is active at every level.?
The BOC has the strength and the diversity of resources to offer its customers a range of financial solutions; such as corporate banking, personal banking, SME banking, investment banking, off-shore banking, development banking, international and treasury and trade financing services, through its widely spread branch network consisting of 628 branches and over 850 ATM/CDM network covering all parts of the country.
The bank has scheduled several events to take place in celebration of its 78th anniversary. Among them are the BOC Ran Kekulu ?Little Picasso? art competition, special Ran Kekulu promotion for babies born in the month of August, several CSR campaigns including a blood donation campaign, a religious procession followed by an overnight ?pirith? chanting on 4th August and an almsgiving on the following day.?

The Premier made this statement at the unveiling of the pinnacle at the Sri Mamgalarama Temple in Galnewa last evening.
"There is a drought prevailing in the country at the moment. It has not affected this area alone as it could create a negative effect on the whole of Sri Lanka. It could make the paddy production go down by 50 per cent. Rice mills have to be closed down if that happens," the premier said.

General elections only in 2020: President
	
The next general elections will be held in three years and those attempting to destabilize the country and disrupt public life through protests and strikes must realize they will not be allowed to change this government until 2020, President Maithripala Sirisena said today.
Delivering the keynote address at the 38th anniversary of the Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA), the President said the government had permitted trade union activities as they were integral parts of a democratic country. But it is sad to witness the strikes, protests and trade union action in a destructive and indecent manner almost daily inconveniencing public life not aimed at winning demands but carrying out politically motivated acts of sabotage.
?This government will never deprive the right to vote and right to engage in trade union action. We have introduced legislation to strengthen the right of franchise and workers rights by constituting Independent Commissions. But all those who enjoy the new found freedom must learn to use them not only for their benefit but that of the country as well,? he said.
President Sirisena said the framework agreement for the Hambantota Port Development Project (HPDP) was signed on September 4th, 2014 during the Mahinda Rajapaksa regime in which he was also a Cabinet minister.
"After this government came to power, through hard negotiations with the Chinese Merchant Port Holding Co (CMPHC) we were able to persuade them to bring down the extent of land sold to the Chinese company by Rajapaksa government by 50% and change the sell out to a lease agreement. Under that agreement, the security of the Hambantota Port and surrounding area including the proposed. The Rajapaksa regime had also given outright 240 acres from the Port City to the Chinese. Under the agreement entered on Port City Project, the Head of State should have got prior permission from the Chinese management of the Port City to land a chopper there. We changed all these clauses," the President said. ?Unfortunately we were not able to retake the highly valuable 6 acre land sold to Shangri-La Hotel Project as it had been sold in deed. A long as I remain as the President of this country I will not let any one to sell a single inch of land or assets of Sri Lanka to any country or foreign company."
The President said the farmework agreement on HPDP was submitted to the Cabinet once again yesterday because he wanted to further amend the agreement to ensure there was no an iota of negative impact on Sri Lanka from it. It will be presented in Parliament at the next session for the members to suggest their own proposals if any and the government was ready to incorporate any worthwhile suggestion.
He said Sri Lanka was known in the world because of its ports from ancient times. The ports in Sri Lanka are also closely involves in its victories and defeats as foreign powers arrived in Sri Lanka through ports. Therefore, Sri Lnkans cannot talk about our history, wars. invasions and the foreign influence without talking on ports located round the country. The SLPA and its employees contribution to the economy and the national development is immeasurable. Now that, with agreement of the HPDD signed the SLPA must not incur Rs. 9.1 billion to maintain loss making Hambantota Port and the employees of the SLPA are to benefit immensely, President Sirisena said and added at the discussion he had with leaders of the trade unions of Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CEYPETCO) yesterday, they realized the importance of signing this agreement.
The SLPA employees are to receive a huge benefits in the form of pay rises, big bonuses, enhanced health and insurance schemes and more welfare facilities as a result of the agreement, President Sirisena said.
Ports and Shipping Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe also spoke. (Sandun A Jayasekera)

In memory of Prasanna Abeysekera: Fans will miss the sound of his guitar
	
?
Sri Lanka?s rock music scene lost one of its beloved artistes with the demise of guitarist Prasanna Abeysekera. He was 61 years old at the time of his death. ??
He was found dead in his room at his mom?s (Turin) residence at Maharagama on July 11. Prasanna had the habit of visiting his mother when he needed a tranquil place to cool off when constant music activities taxed him. ??
Prasanna had done a great show at a beachside venue a few days before his death. His close associates believe it was one of Prasanna?s best shows ever. His mother left him undisturbed when Prasanna visited her. But when there was no sound for some time from the room that her son occupied and seeing his purse on the living room table, made her concerned. When she got the door broken she found that Prasanna had passed away on his bed. It?s believed that he had died in his sleep. ?
Prasanna showed interest in rock music when he was a kid and was studying at Royal College Colombo. He once told this writer that music records were scarce back then, but he and his friends never missed an opportunity to listen to this type of music when they got one. ??
When he entered his teens he was bitten by the ?hippy bug?. This didn?t come as a surprise because those were the days when this movement was gathering momentum in the world. ??
Prasanna formed the band Cancer, his first, in 1978. The music industry will vouch for the fact that Cancer was the first music group in Sri Lanka to play its own rock?n roll music. He was the brother of human rights activist the late Sunila Abeysekare. For the record, Prasanna?s maiden rock?n roll show was sponsored by Sunila and one of her friends. The music that Cancer played became very popular with the Sri Lankan audiences. The band had many shows at the Lionel Wendt. During these days, tickets for his rock?n roll shows were priced between Rs 5 and 10. ??
?
?
"During the latter stages of his music career he had shown a keen interest on playing blues music. The music he played daily had the effect of a dose of medicine on him"
?
Prasanna played music at a time when other artistes were minting money through bookings. As for Prasanna he chose to remain an amateur. His close associates say that he never fancied making music his profession because he disliked obliging to requests, especially songs that didn?t appeal to him. Prasanna?s association with music was continued with mainly to express himself. Luckily for Prasanna, his wife was employed. ??
During the last years of his life, Prasanna played for a group called ?Sakwala Chakraya?. ?
During the latter stages of his music career he had shown a keen interest on playing blues music. Whether it was rock?n roll or blues, the music he played daily had the effect of a dose of medicine on him. ??
He leaves behind his wife Chandrani, son and daughter. ?
?
The music scene he entertained is sure to cherish the fond memories they have of him. May the vibes that this rock artiste created engage the minds of music fans for a long time. ??

Mahendran ?threatened? me to appoint Saman Kumara: Ex-EPF Chief
	
Former EPF Superintendent A. Jayalath told the Commission of Inquiry that former Governor Arjun Mahendran had threatened him to appoint Saman Kumara, the controversial dealer, for EPF Front Office operations in 2015.
Mr. Jayalath also confirmed that there were certain collusive activities visible during the secondary market transactions happened between the EPF and Perpetual Treasuries, where Pan Asia Bank had acted as an intermediary in November 2015.
Currently working as an Assistant Governor at the Central Bank he had been the Superintendent of the EPF Department from April, 2015 to April 2016.
Mr. Jayalath said several transfers took place with the EPF in 2015 and that when he was appointed Superintendent, two experienced officials, Paduman and Dilini, were transferred from the EPF in April 2015.
Later in June, 2015, Saman Kumara was transferred into the EPF and the witness had appointed him to do Risk Management duties.
The witness said he was concerned about the performance of Saman Kumara because the staff at EPF kept informing him about Saman Kumara?s questionable past and his involvement in several controversial deals when he was at the EPF before.
However, on June 8, 2015, former Governor, Arjun Mahendran had phoned him and scolded him saying that he had sent a CFA qualified person to the EPF and to appoint him to the EPF Front Office.
The witness said the former governor wanted Saman Kumara appointed to the Front Office by going against the wish of the witness.
?The governor scolded me and was given one week to appoint Saman o Front Office. It appeared that he was threatening me then I asked him to give one week to do so,? the witness said.
Subsequently, Saman Kumara was trading in equity matters at the Front Office.
During this time the witness said he was repeatedly asked to intensify secondary market transactions of the EPF by the former Governor and as a result he had to send daily reports relating to its transactions to the Governor, which was not a prevailing practice at the CB.
However, in October, 2015 two officials who were handling matters relating to the Front Office Fund Management were also transferred.
The witness said he kept asking for experienced and skilled persons to operate the division but the Governor was reluctant to send previously transferred people back to the EPF but asked him to use Saman Kumara instead.
The witness said he then appointed Saman Kumara as the head of the Front Office, and thereby he started handling deals relating to the Treasury Bonds.
According to the witness it was also revealed that Saman Kumara was a constant visitor to the former Governor's office and their unusual relationship was evident in several instances. He said it was unethical for Saman Kumara to discuss EPF division?s decisions with the Governor.
It was revealed that questionable secondary market transactions between EPF and Perpetual Treasuries Ltd had been taken place in November, 2015, where PABC acted as an intermediary.
However, in January, 2016 there was a rumor circulating in the market about the EPF?s secondary market transactions.
The witness said an e-mail was circulating at that time and consequently he was asked to conduct an investigation about the matter by the Monetary Board and the then Governor.
It was revealed that the witness had prepared a report identifying some suspicious activities that happened during the alleged transactions based on the information he collected at the middle office.
He said the preliminary investigation was conducted in the absence of a voice recording system at the EPF and therefore he had mentioned in his report that he could not affirm allegations stated.
However, the report was given in February 2016 to the then Governor but the witness had not received any feed back from the Governor afterwards. The existence of such a report came to light only in October 2016 during the inquiry conducted under the new Governor Indrajith Kumaraswami.
The witness also said that he had informed the Governor about the necessity of having a voice recording system to scrutinize the dealers who contact with other counter parties. However, setting a voice recording system was never considered.
According to the PCoI Commissioner, Justice Prasanna Jayawardena?s examination it was revealed that setting such voice recording system into the EPF costs only about Rs. one million.
Subsequently, Deputy Solicitor General Milinda Gunathilake, who led the evidence, played few phone conversations that had been taken place between PABC, PTL, and EPF dealers in the course of secondary market transactions.
These voice recordings were obtained by the investigation from the voice recording system of the PABC.
Having listened to the phone conversations, the witness, Mr Jayalath said that it was apparent that the prices and the rates had been prearranged when PTL and EPF have been transacting in the secondary market through PABC, because there were no negotiations visible in the conversations.

Money earned from H?tota port lease to meet Govt.?s expenditure: MR
	
Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa said today the 1.12 billion USD earned from the lease of the Hambantota port was to go to the treasury to meet the day to day expenditure of the government instead of paying the loan taken to build the port.
?The government will not be using the 1.12 billion USD that comes from the lease of the port to pay the loan taken to build the port. Instead the money is to go to the treasury to meet the day to day expenditure of the government. The USD 1.12 billion raised from the privatisation of the Hambantota port is small change for this government and will soon vanish just like the USD 13.7 billion they raised earlier, ?he said.
?As public indignation mounts at the manner in which the Hambantota port was privatised, yahapalana ministers are now going around saying that my government too had planned to sell the entire Hambantota port to the Chinese. This is a diabolical lie. Everyone knows that my government had an explicit anti-privatisation policy. Not only did my government refrain from privatising any State assets, we reacquired several important assets that had been privatised by previous governments,? he said.
Mr. Rajapaksa said if things continued in the present manner, Sri Lanka would not have any national assets left by the time this government completed its tenure.
?The people should band together and organise in the villages, towns and workplaces to oppose this government?s quest to sell Sri Lanka off to foreign buyers,? he said.
?
He said in a statement that the manner in which the government privatised the Hambantota port had shocked the nation and added that Parliament was not allowed to debate the Agreement to privatise one of Sri Lanka?s most important strategic assets.
?No one knows who did the valuation of this asset. No one appears to have seen any technical/financial evaluation report. The government has also not explained to the public on what criteria they selected the company that won the bid when there was clear evidence that the other bid was much more favourable. This headlong quest to sell state assets is a direct result of the economic crisis that the government has plunged this country into. After the yahapalakayas lied their way to the presidency in January 2015, they knew it would not be possible to win the parliamentary election that was soon due by the same means, so they increased the salaries of government servants, reduced the price of fuel, gas and certain foodstuffs in order to bamboozle the people in a different way,? he added.
Mr. Rajapaksa said that the government had increased government expenditure while simultaneously reducing revenue, creating the present financial crisis.
According to the Auditor General?s reports, the Budget deficit which was 5.7% of the GDP in 2014, had almost doubled to 10.5% in 2015 in just one calendar year. The lack of money to meet day to day expenses including the salaries and pensions of state sector employees resulted in massive foreign currency borrowings. In just two and a half years, the yahapalana government has taken foreign currency loans amounting to over USD 13.7 billion. All this money has been spent on consumption. USD 13.7 billion is the equivalent of ten Norochcholai power plants or ten Hambantota Ports, or more than twenty Southern Highways. But the government has nothing to show for all this money that has been borrowed and spent,? he said.
He said under IMF instructions, the value added tax and other taxes were increased in 2016 to raise money to repay these debts.
?After imposing taxes even on terminally ill patients, the government was still not able to raise enough money to repay the USD 13.7 billion they borrowed and they have now resorted to increasing non-tax revenue through the sale of state owned assets,? he said.
He said the Budget proposals of the yahapalana government make it clear that they intend privatising all state owned assets ranging from non-strategic business establishments like the Colombo Hilton to strategic assets like the Norochcholai power plant and that the sale of the Hambantota port was just the beginning.
?The Prime Minister has already announced that the Mattala airport would be next. Other assets like the Colombo -Katunayake Highway, Southern Highway, Water Board and Electricity Board are also due to be privatized,? he said.

Ravi should resign respectfully: Dayasiri
	
Sports Minister Dayasiri Jayasekara said yesterday Foreign Affairs Minister Ravi Karunanayake should resign until the Bond Commission?s probe was completed and that he would support a no-faith motion if brought against Minister Karunanayake.
?The charges levelled against Minister Karunanayake were of grave nature and could amount to money laundering based on the evidence given at the Presidential Commission of Inquiry into Bond Issuance,? he said.
?If Ravi is a gentleman, he should step down until the probe is over or he cleared from charges. This is a blow to the Yahapalanaya. Therefore, if there is a no-faith motion against him, I will support it,? Minister Jayasekara said.
He said former Law and Order Minister Thilak Marapana resigned from the portfolio as a gentleman when there was criticism over his involvement with the Avant-Garde issue. ?But the charges against Ravi are far worse,? he said.
Referring to the allegations made against former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, the minister said minister Karunanayake was in the forefront of those who made allegations against him.
?Investigations against Rajapaksas are ongoing. In the meantime, as members of Yahapalanaya, we should be careful not to repeat mistakes of the former regime,? he said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

Reflections  on Woodward, Bernstein and penthouses
	
Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein
?
In the United States of America the discerning reporter isn?t a hero; he?s a star. When Hollywood was born, and the Americans took over the task of fermenting the world?s youngest art-form from the French, their first scriptwriters came from newspapers and magazines. In earlier periods they were the real storytellers, not the directors, so it wasn?t much of a surprise that the movies they wrote featured their own kind as the protagonists. Somewhere in the fifties, when the world became more cynical, they were, to be sure, characterised as villains (as with Billy Wilder?s Ace in the Hole), but these were exceptions for the most. So when the sixties and seventies came and the American people began suspecting their own leaders, directors and scriptwriters painted the men and women of the press as the people?s heroes. ??
The difference with Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein, the protagonists of Alan J. Pakula?s All the President?s Men (1976), was that unlike other reporters valourised before them in the movies, they were real. Woodward and Bernstein were an odd couple, which meant that they were perfectly equipped to uncovering the links that would take them from a simple break-in at the Democratic National Committee Headquarters to Richard Nixon?s resignation. They were the heroes behind Watergate, with the caveat that they were only doing their job by respecting the truth; had Richard Nixon not been the villain, Watergate wouldn?t have been as popular, but these two wouldn?t have given a damn about that. It was a gentler time, certainly more idealistic, when reporters treasured hard facts over yellow speculation. ??
All the President?s Men was the last of a trilogy of films that Pakula made about the culture of paranoia which swept across America after the Kennedy assassinations. All in all, it was the most realistic of the three, not least because it was based on a real-life incident and was hence driven less by conjecture than by historical actuality. Looking back now, it?s seems a little dated, but still transcends the limits of its medium. When Cary Grant and Joel McCrea and Kirk Douglas acted as reporters, they really did act. But when Dustin Hoffman and Robert Redford acted in Pakula?s film, however, they weren?t performers. They were those they had been taken in to act out. ??
?
?
"When the sixties came, and when we began to move away from America and moved into Bergman, Fellini, and Antonioni, we knew the world wasn?t so simple. We were taught that the corrupt were purveyors of decency, that at times they were so successful at this deception that we fooled ourselves into trusting them"
?
Of course All the President?s Men isn?t about this odd journalistic couple only, since if that were the case it wouldn?t have been different to all those films that Grant, McCrea, and Douglas had acted in before. It?s about an intricate political web built on intrigue, vagueness, and confusion; from the five White House ?plumbers? and their connection to the CIA to the dubiously named Committee to Re-elect the President (with the acronym CREEP) that Nixon used to smear his political rivals, that web was so carefully crafted, so well oiled, that it was bound to be discovered. ??
Watergate was to the seventies what Monica Lewinsky was to the nineties, with the caveat that Bill Clinton?s extramarital affairs never really dampened his base because no one had the moral authority to vilify him, definitely not the Republicans. Richard Nixon, on the other hand, inspired derision from the beginning of his presidency. As Michael O?Leary points out in a series of articles on the man, he was a precursor to Donald Trump, obsessive over hunting rivals as both were. Even before Watergate, he was on his way out. The American political culture had shifted from George Washington, who couldn?t tell a lie, to Nixon, who couldn?t tell the truth. ??
What is it about political cover-ups that inspires so much derision and hatred among us, the people, apart from the fact that those cover-ups tend to affect the people badly? I rather think the movies were a good indicator of how we reacted to them. The directors of the thirties told us that things would only get better. The directors who emerged after World War II told us that good would triumph over evil. But that was a time when political decency was a given, a by default quality no one seriously questioned. When the sixties came, and when we began to move away from America and moved into Bergman, Fellini, and Antonioni, we knew the world wasn?t so simple. We were taught that the corrupt were purveyors of decency, that at times they were so successful at this deception that we fooled ourselves into trusting them. ??

Harry Caul (Gene Hackman) attempts to listen in on a private conversation in Francis Ford Coppola?s?The Conversation (1974)
?
Popular culture, as I implied in my political column last week, has a tendency of making the most obvious things in life seem ambivalent. One can?t blame the artist, because he or she has to work with limited resources and is compelled to use those resources even with the most generous budget. At times, however, this culture of ambivalence tends to contradict even the most commendable intentions of that artist. I remember my friend Dhanuka Bandara contending, for instance, that after the fall of Mahinda Rajapaksa our playwrights ran out of so much steam in their work that they became bankrupt. The same can, I believe, be said of our movie makers. ??
It?s a telling indictment on our society, but we (perhaps because of our movies, television serials, and satirical plays) have conditioned ourselves to be infatuated with the corrupt. In America the corrupt were always villains, so much so that those who played the stakes against them, even if they were dishonest crooks, were valorised as heroes. (Like Paul Newman and Robert Redford from The Sting, the conmen who won us over because they went up against a very dislikeable mob leader.) ??
The Americans taught us to croon over crooks as long as they were undoing bigger crooks. The problem with our directors and scriptwriters, today, is that our political culture is full of those bigger crooks. What we lack are the smaller crooks to be infatuated with. The closest to such a figure, from our history, was Saradiel. In the hands of our directors, however, he was never made out to be the Newman-Hoffman-Redford kind of hero. The television serial on Saradiel has none of the vibrancy or potency that Rienzi Crusz?s poems on him contain, to give just one example. ??

"I remember my friend Dhanuka Bandara contending, for instance, that after the fall of Mahinda Rajapaksa our playwrights ran out of so much steam in their work that they became bankrupt. The same can, I believe, be said of our movie makers"
?
Watergate was, as Pauline Kael once idiosyncratically observed, the culmination of what the movies had been telling us. Frank Wills, the security guard at the Watergate complex, discovered the burglary at the DNC Headquarters on the night of June 17, 1972. The Godfather was released two months before, on March 15. Richard Nixon tendered his resignation on August 9, 1974. The Conversation was released three months before, on April 7. Francis Ford Coppola, who directed both, was one of the few prophets that Hollywood bred, surprising because Hollywood, with its preference for predictable, commercially oriented plotlines, despised prophets. Both those movies were about the underworld, in the mafia and within the government. ??
The intricate web those behind Watergate strung around it was, as I mentioned before, so well oiled that it was bound to come out. Sooner or later. I can?t help, but feel that we are seeing this same process of unravelling, despite the best attempts of various corporate, political, and journalistic elites, with respect to the Bond Commission and Perpetual Treasuries. The signs seem to be there; days and even weeks of nothing happening followed by a sensationalist discovery, the most recent being Anika Wijesuriya?s submissions about the 165 million rupee penthouse deal. ??
?
A still from the film ?All the President?s Men?
?
We are like the America of the seventies; decency in politics today is the exception, not the norm. Because of the faith we have lost in those we elect, at times soon after they are elected, we repose our trust in those who reveal them for who they are. Journalists, once despised as harbingers of sensationalism (especially during the war years), are more revered now than ever before. They currently serve the function they served in the West after the Kennedy assassinations, Watergate, the Contras, and Monica Lewinsky; restore the public?s taste for the truth. A coincidence?
??
I for one think not. We revel in seeing the worst of ourselves reflected in the worst of those who hold public office. We are opposed to transparency because we want to lead private lives. Politicians can?t be like that, but politicians are as much the human beings we are. The Bond Commission, from its inception, was tainted by a sensationalist clamour for conspiracy theories, from its connection with Mahinda Rajapaksa (allegedly linked to Arjun Aloysius, nephew of the former Central Bank Governor) to its latest development, the penthouse deals. We are secretly as opposed to openness as those involved in this fiasco are, but we are also curious. The Bond conspiracy theories, going by that, reflect our desire to unravel, to demystify. ??
It?s simplistic to compare Bond 2017 to Watergate 1972. Except for one important point; like the latter, the former is driven by an inchoate mixture of mystery and discovery. Weeks, sometimes months, go by without anything being reported about the Commission. And then, just like that, it captures five column headlines. Just the other day I was reading about a concerted effort by both governing parties to oust the man at the centre of this fiasco. Whether or not that happens is something not even prophets are qualified to answer, but I wonder; will it unravel the way Watergate did through Bernstein and Woodward? Perhaps a movie, as prescient as Coppola?s or Pakula?s, might be just what we need. Until then, however, we can only conjecture. ??

Sanasa Insurance uplifts lives of needy with unique ?Sanasa Movement?
	
Created by the society, with the society, and for the society, ?Sanasa movement? is truly the largest and one-of-its-kind in the country with an ever-increasing membership.?
The Sanasa movement membership comprises of around 20 percent of the country?s total population. It?s an ever-growing independent group spread throughout the country and by far is the largest of such nature in Sri Lanka. Its primary objective is poverty alleviation programmes for the common man.
The Sanasa movement follows a cooperative philosophy amongst its members and has over 8,000 primary societies in various territories designated from the rural conclaves to the townships. The beauty of these communities is the magnitude of its unity as people from various faiths and religious backgrounds join hands together under the philosophy of cooperative values and principles as one community.
The mother in the typical Sri Lankan household plays a significant role in nurturing, guidance and family growth. No matter the different roles and responsibilities each person has or takes on, it often falls on the wife and mother to discern how to best support and nurture each relationship within the family.And this reflects well in the Sanasa movement 60pct of its members are women, especially mothers.
They understand and take all precautionary steps to ensure that the family is leading a happy life with no or less financial difficulties to achieve the goals of each family member. For this, insurance plays a crucial role by providing financial security and wellbeing for them when it?s needed most. It brings to them such a relief, peace of mind, and happiness. Sanasa Insurance has conducted numerous programmes in villages to maintain and develop sustainability.?
While the micro insurance schemes aid them in developing their living conditions and entrepreneurial endeavors, the company also focuses on better educating the children of the communities, encouraging their talents to shine through various programmes, amongst others. Sanasa Insurance continues to work with the Sanasa Movement to improve the society.
The insurance business is a happy one said Indika Kiriwandeniya, General Manager- Sanasa Insurance Company Limited. ?Unlike personal loans where the applicant doesn?t get much affected when it?s rejected, it?s totally different in the insurance business. Customers come to us with very high expectations that are crucial to their lives, such as in case of death, an accident, education funding, a retirement plan, etc. And when their requests are rejected or claims not being settled, it gives us such a sad and guilt feeling. On the contrary when claims are settled the customers and their families are happy and delightful?
?We in the insurance industry are high risk-takers and are often stressed, yet we are the happiest that can be as it brings a great pleasure and relief to help people plan their future, help them to have a mind of peace, help them at difficult times.?
The movement has over 12,000 volunteers supporting the network from all across the region. There is no other organization that boasts of so many volunteers and their attitude is indeed very admirable. They come together once a month and don?t expect any financial gains in return as they feel proud to be a part of it, by serving, spreading and leading the movement.?
Sanasa Federation, the apex body of the Sanasa movement, stands as the official representative on behalf of its community countrywide, dealing with state, national and international councils and authorities on its policies, and is an active member of many global cooperative institutions such as ICA, ACCU, IRU and CICTAB. Sanasa Insurance Company Ltd is a leading micro insurance provider focused on uplifting and empowering the people at the grass root level.

We will protect Unity Government until 2020: TPA
	
We will continue to support the Unity Government and protect it till 2020 even if the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) decides to leave the alliance, the Tamil Progressive Alliance (TPA) led by Minister Mano Ganesan said today.
Addressing a press conference, TPA Deputy Leader Palani Thigambaram said that though some parties were keen on breaking up the present coalition the TPA would defend it to the end.
The minister said due to the financial liabilities left behind by the Rajapaksa regime, the present government had been unable to share the benefits of development with the public as yet, but they were confident that this would change for the better in the coming years.
He also said that their alliance believes that the government would not protect those accused of wrongdoings and that the law should be enforced equally to all citizens after impartial inquiries are conducted. ?I don?t know whether Foreign Minister Ravi Karunanayake is guilty of the charges brought against him. However if he has committed a crime we believe that even he should be punished under the good governance policy of this government,? the minister said.
Meanwhile, commenting on the attack on the two policemen in Jaffna recently, he said one or two isolated incidents had been reported but they were not of a serious nature. He said under the present government there is no opportunity for terrorism to raise its ugly head again, therefore the people should not be unnecessarily afraid.
Minister Thigambaram also warned that some private media institutions were carrying out mud-slinging campaigns in the hopes of tarnishing his image. He said media freedom was a part of a vibrant society and it is also the responsibility of the media to carry unbiased news. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)
