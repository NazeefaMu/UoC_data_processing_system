16 Indian fishermen to be released: Minister
	
Fisheries Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said today that sixteen Indian fishermen arrested recently for allegedly poaching in Sri Lankan waters will be released tomorrow (14).
Meanwhile, Indian media reported that the Indian fishermen will be released in as a goodwill gesture to mark Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe's first foreign visit to India.
The reports said quoting Prime Minister's Office that a fishing organisation in Tamil Nadu had made an appeal to the government to consider the medical condition of the arrested fishermen.
The fishermen are to be released on humanitarian grounds, it further said.
However Minister Amaraweera said there was no special reason. The released is not related to the PMs visit to India. The process to release the Indian fishermen has been taking place several times and this is just one of them he said.
In March, Sri Lanka ordered the release of 86 Indian fishermen arrested for allegedly poaching in Sri Lankan waters as a goodwill gesture to mark Modi's visit and after, President Maithripala Sirisena ordered the release of 54 Indian fishermen from Tamil Nadu in April. (Darshana Sanjeewa)

No CEPA with India: Minister
	
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe will not be finalising or discussing a Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA) with India during his visit to New Delhi tomorrow, Development Strategies and International Trade Minister Malik Samarawickrama said today.
In a statement, he rejected claims made by certain politicians that Prime Minister Wickremesinghe and his Indian counterpart would finalise the agreement and that it would adversely affect the country.
The minister said before signing such an important agreement, there were many aspects that needed to be carefully scrutinised.
He said, through such baseless claims and empty rhetoric on the CEPA and the Indian visit, some bankrupt politicians were attempting to misinform the people.
Mr. Samarawickrama said the present government would not allow any international agreement to fill the pockets of politicians instead of the benefits trickling down to the people. (Piyumi Fonseka)

Don't rush into CEPA: JVP
	
Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) today warned that the local industrial sector would be adversely affected by granting more access to Indians via the Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA) with India.
JVP Propaganda Secretary Vijitha Hearth said they had information that the CEPA would be a main focus during talks between Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and his Indian counterpart.
Mr. Herath said if the CEPA which was first mooted some 15 years ago was signed it would mean a severe blow to our local producers and market stakeholders because the CEPA opens the doors for Indian traders to ply their trade without any let or hindrance in Sri Lanka.
The CEPA is extremely favourable to Indians and impact negatively on the local business sector. Sri Lanka's exports to India have been estimated at US$580 million while Indian imports to Sri Lanka had increased from US$600 million to US$3,730 million and such a situation is not good for our economy, he said.
Mr. Herath claimed that if the CEPA was implemented, an increasing number of Indian professionals such as doctors, engineers and labourers would come over to Sri Lanka thus dealing a severe blow to our professionals.
He said the CEPA should not be signed without a thorough and realistic reassessment of the agreement and that above all the economic and other burning problems of our people should be resolved on a priority basis before taking it upon itself any other issues based on regional of political considerations.

Malwatta Chapter Mahanayaka, the Most Ven. Thibbatuwawe Sri Sumangala Thera, stressed the need for the government to think of underground roads as a solution to the frequent traffic congestion being experienced within the Kandy City limits and on the road circling the Kandy Lake.
The Thera, advised Minister of University Education and Highways Lakshman Kiriella, who visited the Malwatta Temple to seek the Theras blessing, not to risk destroying the Udawatta Forest Reserve if the road planned to be built across the Forest Reserve was executed.
The Minister after assuming duties at his ministry, visited the Sri Dalada Maligawa on Saturday (12) and offered flowers to the Dalada Maligawa. He then sought the blessings of the Mahanayaka of the temple and revealed details of the development work planned for Kandy.
He cited the Colombo-Kandy Expressway as one of the immediate development projects to be undertaken by the government and explained the advantages that would accrue from it. He said with the completion of the expressway,the duration of the journey between the two cities would come down drastically.
He also touched on why the government had decided upon a new road as an alternative to reopening the existing road that runs in front of the Dalada Maligawa. He also told the prelate that they had planned to build a tunnel road linking Gatambe to Thennakumbura.
Ven. Sumangala Thera had emphasized the advantage of having Chinese expertise in the construction of projects such as the one planned involving tunnel roads.
The minister also visited the Asgiriya Viharaya and updated the Asgiri Maha Nayaka, Most Ven.Galagama Sri Atthadassi Thera on what he had discussed with the Chief prelate of the Malwatta Chapter. (J.A.L. Jayasinghe and L.B.Senaratne)

Hakeem rejects govt. charges
	
	Sri Lanka Muslim Congress (SLMC) leader Rauff Hakeem said today his party neither demanded a separate administrative district nor had any secret agreement with the TNA to amalgamate North and East as alleged by the government.
	Mr. Hakeem said the Muslim Congress was formed as a result of the fight to separate North and East.
	The government is making allegations that the SLMC and the TNA have secret agreement to amalgamate the North and the East. We strongly reject that allegation and regret even the President is making such allegations on stage. We do not have any hidden agendas between us. We left the government to uphold good governance in the country, Hakeem said.
	He told a news conference that the SLMC condemned the allegation that they were demanding a separate district or province in East and said it was the government that suggested appointing a separate Additional Divisional Secretary in Amapara to facilitate the Tamil speaking majority in the coastal area in Ampara District.
	During the discussions with the government, it was suggested appointing a separate Additional Divisional Secretary (or AGA) to resolve administrative problems of 96 per cent of Tamil speaking people in the coastal areas of the Ampara District. 
	As a result, the government appointed an Additional Divisional Secretary a month ago to decentralise administration in the district. The same thing happened in the Vavuniya District, where such separate Divisional Secretary was appointed to facilitate Sinhala people. But the government is spreading false news that we are demanding a separate district, he said.
	Mr. Hakeem said the government was spreading false news among the Sinhala Buddhists regarding SLMC principles to create wrong picture about them in the minds of Sinhala people.
	UNP Leadership Council President Karu Jayasuriya said the Temple Trees had become a political office which created false news regarding opposition candidates.
	Mr. Jayasuriya alleged that the State media were being used to sling mud at opposition politicians.
	Democratic People's Front leader Mano Ganeshan said the Tamils, Muslims and Sinhalese had got a good opportunity to join hands and move forward after the war was completed.
He requested the government not to damage the re-union of all the communities by spreading false news and said the government must be happy about this reunion if it really loved the country. (Ajith Siriwardana)

UN to avoid holding meetings on Vesak Day
	
	On the instructions of President Mahinda Rajapaksa, the Permanent Mission of Sri Lanka to the United Nations in New York successfully negotiated a Resolution which was adopted by consensus on December 29, 2014 whereby the United Nations General Assembly acknowledged the significance of the Day of Vesak observed in many member countries, the External Affairs Ministry said.
	It invited the United Nations bodies at Headquarters and other duty stations, to avoid holding meetings on that Day. To this end, the Resolution also encourages this arrangement to be taken into account when formulating future calendars of conferences and meetings.
	
	President Rajapaksa welcomed the consensual decision by the world body, which is in keeping with Sri Lankas ethical society where livelihoods are based on the teachings of the Buddha. He further observed that Buddhism has demonstrated to the world, that while anger and hatred are causes for sorrow, compassion and loving kindness is the path to contentment, with all divisions based on race, religion, caste and tribe being wholly meaningless. President Rajapaksa upheld that this significant achievement spearheaded by Sri Lanka on behalf of over 400 million Buddhists globally, will increase awareness of the teachings of the Buddha among the world community.
	
	The current initiative builds upon the Resolution adopted in 1999 by the United Nations, which recognised the international observance of the Day of Vesak at the United Nations Headquarters and other UN offices. The Resolution in 1999 was also an initiative of Sri Lanka.
	
	Although Vesak has been observed at the UN since 1999, meetings have continued to be scheduled on that day each year. With the adoption of the current resolution, the scheduling of such meetings and events will be avoided, enabling the Observance of Vesak at the United Nations Headquarters and other offices to be held with wider participation and the sanctity it deserves.
	
	Recognising other major religions observed by the world community, the General Assembly, in this instance also called on the UN to avoid scheduling meetings on Diwali, GurPurab, Orthodox Christmas and Yom Kippur.
	Quote: President Rajapaksa welcomed the consensual decision by the world body, which is in keeping with Sri Lankas ethical society where livelihoods are based on the teachings of the Buddha.

	Foreign Affairs Minister Mangala Samaraweera today requested those in the international community who are skeptical of the accountability measures due to be implemented in Sri Lanka, to not judge the new government by the broken promises, experiences and u-turns of the past.
	Let us design, define and create our future by our hopes and aspirations, and not be held back by the fears and prejudices of the past. Let us not be afraid to dream. Let us not be afraid to engage in meaningful dialogue aimed at finding solutions to problems as opposed to pointing fingers, heaping blame and scoring political points at the expense of future generations, he said as he addressed the 30th UNHRC session in at the Palais Des Nations in Geneva a short while ago.
	He also asked the international community to maintain their confidence on the fact that a process of accountability would be observed with due processes to ensure impartiality.
	Minister Samaraweera asked the international community to shed their doubts on the success of an accountability process in Sri Lanka, while assuring the newly elected government is one that acknowledges the suffering of victims across the countrys communities and one that recognizes the mistakes of the past.
	He said the appointments of the TNA Leader as the Leader of the Opposition, as well as the appointment of the 44th Chief Justice in January were clear messages that indicate the dawn of a new era in Sri Lanka where every individual irrelevant of their ethnicity, religion, class or gender would be granted their rightful place.
	The Minister said the government has already planned for the establishment of the following independent and credible mechanisms for truth seeking, justice, reparations and guarantees of non-recurrence and the mechanisms are as follows:
	For truth seeking, the establishment by statute, of two mechanisms:
	(i) A Commission for Truth, Justice, Reconciliation and Non-recurrence to be evolved in consultation with the relevant authorities of South Africa. This mechanism is envisaged as having a dual structure: a Compassionate Council composed of religious dignitaries from all major religions in the country and a structure composed of Commissioners that would allow the victims to discover the truth
	(ii) An Office on Missing Persons based on the principle of the families right to know, set up by Statute with expertise from the ICRC, and in line with internationally accepted standards.
	-On the Right to Justice - a Judicial Mechanism with a Special Counsel to be set up by Statute that accounts the right of victims to a fair remedy and aims to address the problem of impunity for human rights violations suffered by all communities. 
	-On the Right to Reparation - an Office for Reparations to be set up by Statute to facilitate the implementation of recommendations relating to reparations made by the proposed Commission on Truth, Justice, Reconciliation and Non-recurrence, the Office of the Missing Persons, the LLRC and any other entity.
	- In order to guarantee non-recurrence - a series of measures are to be undertaken including administrative and judicial reform that includes amendments to the penal code to criminalize hate speech and enforced disappearances, the adoption of a new Constitution to address grievances of the Tamil community which would be carried out through a Constituent Assembly of Parliament that would be set up shortly. . .
	He went on to state that this accountability process will help restore the good name of the armed forces and it would thereby further contribute to peace and stability in the world through significantly greater engagement in peacekeeping and humanitarian activities.
	This journey may not be as fast as some may want it to be. And for some, we may have already gone too far, he said while adding however that the government led by President Sirisena and PM Wickremesinghe has the political will and the courage of their convictions to ensure that the country moves forward while breaking barriers of ignorance, fear, prejudice and hate. 
	Meanwhile, he also thanked the UNHRC members for placing their trust in Sri Lanka at the 28th session and agreeing to the deferral of the release of the international investigation on Sri Lanka carried out by the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) on the alleged abuses that occurred during the final stages of the war.
	The Minister noted that it granted the government much needed space to implement its engagement with the international community including the High Commissioner for Human Rights and his office and to execute meaningful measures aimed at achieving reconciliation, strengthening democratic institutions and building confidence among communities affected by conflict for many years.

Drop charges for showing No Fire Zone": Malaysia
	
	The Malaysian authorities should end their prosecution of a local activist for her role in showing a documentary film without censorship board approval, Human Rights Watch said today.
	Malaysias Federal Court will hear Lena Hendrys challenge to the constitutionality of the Film Censorship Act on September 14, 2015.
	Hendry, a staff member of the human rights group Pusat KOMAS, was charged under the act for organizing a private screening of the award-winning documentary, No Fire Zone: The Killing Fields of Sri Lanka, on July 3, 2013, in Kuala Lumpur. If convicted, she faces up to three years in prison and a fine of up to RM30,000 (US$7,000).
	Prosecuting someone for the private showing of an award-winning film shows how determined Malaysian authorities are to stomp on the right to free expression, said Phil Robertson, deputy Asia director. The government should call off its intensifying assault on free expression and promptly amend the Film Censorship Act.
	Section 6 of Malaysias Film Censorship Act, under which Hendry is being prosecuted, prohibits the circulation, distribution, display, production, sale, hire or possession of any film, whether imported or domestically produced, without first obtaining approval from the government-appointed Board of Censors. The law defines film very broadly  and could potentially be applied to home videos or videos taken on a smartphone. Should the Federal Court, Malaysias highest, rule against Hendry, her case will proceed to trial.
	To date, the Film Censorship Act has been seldom invoked and Pusat KOMAS regularly screens films on politics, human rights, culture, and other issues without censorship board approval, with admission by pre-registration only. The charges against Hendry appear to have been primarily motivated by the Malaysian governments desire to appease Sri Lankan embassy officials, who had publicly demanded that the film not be shown and visited the venue, the Kuala Lumpur Selangor Chinese Assembly Hall, on the day of the films showing to urge the venues managers to cancel the event. No Fire Zone concerns war crimes committed in the last months of Sri Lankas civil war, including Sri Lankan army artillery attacks that indiscriminately killed thousands of civilians and the extrajudicial executions of captured fighters and supporters of the secessionist Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam.
	The authorities politically motivated prosecution of Hendry is contrary to internationally recognized standards for the protection of freedom of expression. The imposition of criminal penalties for choosing to possess or show a film that the government has not previously approved is not necessary to protect national security, public order, public morals, or the rights and reputations of others, and imposes a disproportionate burden on a fundamental right.
	Rather than acting like a big brother to censor films Malaysians have a right to see, the government should change the law that allows this misuse of power, Robertson said. Malaysians should never have to fear arrest for organizing a film festival or going to watch a movie.

Fitch affirms Citibank N.A.-Colombo branch at AAA(lka)
	
		 		 
		 
			
Fitch Ratings Lanka has affirmed Citibank N.A.- Colombo Branchs (CitiSL) National Long-Term Rating at AAA(lka).The Outlookis Stable.
CitiSLs rating is the highest on the National Rating scale and reflects the credit profile and financial strength of Citibank, N.A. (A+/Stable). Citibank, N.A.s rating is higher than Sri Lankas Long-Term Local and Foreign Currency Issue Default Ratings (IDRs) of BB-/Stable, and as a result CitiSLs rating on the National Rating scale is mapped to AAA(lka).
The rating is linked with Citibank, N.A.s IDR because of CitiSLs legal status as a branch of Citibank, N.A., which makes it a part of the same legal entity. Fitch believes that support from Citibank, N.A. would be forthcoming if required, subject to any regulatory constraints on remitting money into Sri Lanka.
CitiSLs strategic objectives are aligned with that of Citigroup. The branch is integrated into global operations through utilisation of common systems, such as groups core banking and anti-money laundering systems, and through regular reporting, including periodic internal audits.
CitiSLs loan book contracted by 3.3 percent in 1H15, in line with the declines recorded by other Fitch-rated foreign bank branches in Sri Lanka. Loans accounted for 24% of its total assets at end-1H15 (2014: 24 percent), lower than the ratio of its peers. CitiSL has consistently maintained sound asset quality with no non-performing loans since 2009.
The branch remains focused on its narrowly defined corporate customer base, reflecting CitiSLs focus on exposures that meet the groups return parameters. As a result, its loan book is significantly concentrated, with the five largest loans accounting for 50 percent of total lending
at end-1H15.
Operations are largely funded through deposits (89 percent of total funding at end-1H15), although the branch has access to intergroup funding, if needed. CitiSLs Fitch Core Capital (FCC) ratio increased to 54.9 percent at end-1H15 and 45.7 percent at end-2014 from 33 percent at end-2013 due to retention of profits and a decline in risk-weighted assets. The branchs FCC ratio is much higher than its domestic peers.
CitiSL was established in 1979 and operates as a single branch. It accounted for 0.49 percent of the Sri Lankan banking sectors assets at end-2014. It is the smallest of the Fitch-rated foreign bank branches operating in Sri Lanka.
A downgrade of CitiSL rating could result from Citibank, N.A.s rating falling below Sri Lankas IDR. Any changes to Fitchs expectation of support from head office could also have a negative impact on the rating.

OISL findings are of a serious nature: UN Rights Chief
	
Hinting at the contents of the report on the international investigation on Sri Lanka carried out by the UNHRC, which set for public release on Wednesday, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Raad Al Hussein notes the findings of the OISL (OHCHR Investigation on Sri Lanka) are of the most serious nature.
In the opening statement, which High Commissioner Zeid is due to deliver at the opening session of the 30th UNHRC session this afternoon he states that while the vision and commitment shown by President Maithripala Sirisena and the new government is welcome, the UNHRC owes Sri Lankans to ensure an accountability process that produces results and moves beyond the failures of the past.
I welcome the vision shown by President Sirisena since his election in January 2015, and the commitments made by the new Government under his leadership. But this Council owes it to Sri Lankans - and to its own credibility - to ensure an accountability process that produces results, decisively moves beyond the failures of the past, and brings the deep institutional changes needed to guarantee non-recurrence, the High Commissioner will note in his statement.
The report on the international investigation which came to be known as OISL (OHCHR investigation on Sri Lanka), which was mandated through a US sponsored resolution in March 2014, was due to be released at the last UNHRC session but was granted a one-time only deferral. It is set to be released to the public on Wednesday (16) along with the high Commissioners recommendations and would be officially presented before the Council on September 30.

Seylan Tikiri creative till competition entry period extended
	
		 		 
		 
			
In keeping with Seylan Banks intention of promoting savings among children, a Creative till Competition is launched aiming children below 10 years of age. This is the first competition of its kind organized by any Bank in the island, and will reward the main winners with a package tour to visit Dreamworld theme park in Thailand. 
The competition consists of two aspects. First, children are expected to design and create a till (within the dimensions of length 8 inches x width 8 inches x height 8 inches) and make it as creative and innovative as they wish.
Secondly, the competition will reward the entrant who managed to save the most amount of money within the given period of time. The competition also offers many more attractive prizes toits participants.
Due to numerous requests, especially from schools where the bank maintains student savings centres, the deadline for the competition has been extended to 25th September to accommodate more entries. Seylan Bank branches would be accepting completed tills from 1st September onwards. Completed tills should be handed over to the branch where the Tikiri account is maintained. You could also enter the competition by opening a new account in the event you are a not an account holder.
Seylan Banks minor savings scheme, Seylan Tikiri, with a history of 23 years is one of the most favoured childrens savings accounts in Sri Lanka. The Seylan Student Savings Centres located in schools across the island play a vital role in acting as channel extensions in reaching out to the children to promote the savings habit.
While rewarding the child depositors with novel and innovative gifts, Tikiri also imparts and encourages the savings habit from a tender age. Seylan banks belief is if children get involved in banking practices from their early childhood, they will learn about finance, fund management and practice savings throughout their adult lives. 
Tilan Wijeyesekera DGM Marketing and personal banking, Seylan Bank said, The savings you make today becomes a wonderful gift for a childs future. The Seylan Student Savings Centers are run by the senior students of the school to whom the bank provides training.
This guidance along with the savings habit nurtures the children and gives valuable insights for investments as they grow older. Further Seylan Tikiri is also renowned for being closely connected with its customers and consistently engaging them in various activities that highlight their talents.

By Shabiya Ali Ahlam
Good times have returned for The Finance Company (TFC), Sri Lankas first Non-Banking Financial Institution (NBFI), as for the first time after several years of unhealthy performance the entity has finally being able to steer its key performance indicator to thecorrect path. Despite having recorded a loss of Rs.1.84 billion for the financial year 2014/2015,1.7 percent higher against the Rs.1.78 billion recorded 2013/2014, the latest annual report of TFC shows that it has made progress in the area of loan disbursement, interest income, deposit mobilisation and recovery of non-performing loans.
The report highlights that the loss for the year under review was due to the impairment of some legacy balancesof Rs.158 million of the previous financial year.
Loan disbursement has increased from Rs.5.7 billion in 2013/14 to Rs.9.7 billion in 2014/15, while interest income recorded a considerable increase during thesame period.
Deposit mobilization increased from Rs.9.2 billion to Rs.12.2 billion, an increase of 33 percent. Furthermore, loan recoveries have also increased to a record level of Rs.10.3 billion when compared with the previous years collection of Rs.8.6 billion.
TFC noted that these comprehensive developments have contributed to drop the gross NPL ratio of the post 2009 portfolio from 8.3 percent to 5.2 percent during the periodunder review.
The company stated that as a result of this positive trend, TFCs cash flow has strengthened allowing the management to increase the monthly loan disbursement volume with a better outreach to get a steady flow of interest income to the institution intime to come.
Continuous new strategies implemented by the management throughout the period, havebeen instrumental in reducing the monthly operational losses which are mainly associated with non-yielding assets inherited from the pastsix years.
The new management was able to align TFCs overall business challenges in such a way that turned around some of the non-yielding assets to yielding assets making the Companys future more stable, stated TFC Chairman Dr. S. H. A. M. Abeyratne.
He stressed that to maintain the momentum; a vital task has tobe fulfilled by the senior managementby way of investing in human resources development, introduction of new processes with new technology,and enhancement of professionalism among the employees, giventhe highly complex andcompetitive financingbusiness environment in the country.

The Maithripala Administration will carry out an investigation into the failure by the present regime to collect a sum of US$7 billion which was owed to Sri Lanka by Cairn Energy which breached the contract to extract oil from the Mannar Basin, JHU General Secretary Patali Champika Ranawaka said today.
He said the US$7 billion which was earned by Cairn Energy as a result of its share price hike after the announcement it made saying it had found Gas in Mananr Basin.
Mr. Ranawaka, a former Minister of Power and Energy, said the price of shares belonging to Cairn Energy would have benefited Sri Lanka but unfortunately oil prices had declined.
He said the company had paid more than US$1 billion to the Indian government in a similar situation that had occurred a business deal with India.
This is a mega deal and we will bring those responsible for this massive loss when we come to power, Mr. Ranawaka said.
Relating the story behind the oil and gas exploration, he said the international funding agencies paid attention to oil and gas exploration in 1990 and the project was initiated in 2000. He said Norwegian TGS OPEC was allowed to explore for oil in 2002 while in 2007 the Mannar Basin was divided into eight sections or fields based on seismic data.
He said the third field was given to Cairn Energy, which is a British company owned by a close associate of former British PM Tony Blair. In 2011, Cairn had announced that Gas was found there but Cairn closed a deal with Vedanta where 40 percent of the stake was closed and the promise to extract oil within two years he said was not honored.
Mr. Ranawaka said a litre of petrol Octane-92 could be sold at Rs.58.11 per litre, Petrol high Octane at Rs.73, diesel at Rs.69, Kerosene at Rs.69 and furnace oil at Rs.49 with the reduction of premium that can also be reduced with decrease in global oil prices.

It is therefore surprising that the EU Heads of Mission in Colombo should have resorted to a press statement on an issue of a strictly domestic nature. Such an initiative could bring into question the bona-fides and objectivity of their intervention, it said.
The ministry said the Elections Commissioner, who is an independent authority, has been mandated by the statutory powers vested in him, with the task of conducting free and fair elections. 
Sri Lanka has a vibrant tradition of democratic practice since 1931 and has been conducting elections at regular intervals, in a peaceful and orderly manner, while the electorate has continued to cast their vote freely, in large numbers, it said.

Pray, thou shalt be served!
	
Five Blue Diyawanna members called on the new Big Boss at his official residence in Colombo the other day.
From Galle, Matara, Matale, Mahanuwara and Puttalam, they were among the Betel leaf members who campaigned hard for the former strongman at the January 8 Presidential poll and later formed the vanguard of the intra-party operation launched to promote him as the Prime Ministerial candidate. One of them was a hero who disdained a yahapalanaya Ministerial office in a show of solidarity with the former strongman.
The one time aggressive quintet, now a picture of subservience greeted the new Big Boss respectfully and explained to him the purpose of their visit. Sir, we had to campaign under the leadership of the former boss at the general election because we wanted to win. Please think of us also when making ministerial appointments
The new Big Boss who greeted their appeal with a guffaw said: Sorry, you have come a little too late.
Disappointment was clearly written on their faces as they bade adieu to the new Big Boss, they say.
However, their visit was not entirely in vain. Three of the five members were appointed Deputies later.

A lady in the running for city mayoralty
	
Now that the elections to the local bodies is round the corner, there is much speculation in political circles as to who would be the Green partys Mayoral candidate for the city.
According to our reports, two Green party stalwarts are already in the running for the Mayoral seat -- one is the incumbent Muzza and the other one is Rosy who failed to make it to Diyawanna at the recent general poll.
Despite there being miles to go before crossing the bridge, the duo, they say, have begun canvassing in earnest, each trying to get the better of the other.
Whether Colombo will get as its Mayor an ever-young beauty or the familiar Muzza is something time will tell.

The incumbent has already consented to serve as the countrys envoy in a cool clime somewhere Down Under.

Amna Bank expands ATM network to Addalachenai and Maruthamunai
	
Amna Bank recently expanded its ATM network with the opening of two off-site ATMs on the same day in Addalachenai and Maruthamunai in the Eastern Province of Sri Lanka.
With the addition of these two ATMs, Amna Banks ATM network has expanded to 26 ATMs, which includes 3 off-site ATMs in addition to the 24 branches the Bank has Island-wide.
Amna Banks Chief Executive Officer Mohamed Azmeer ceremonially opened the two ATMs located at New Shopping Complex, Pradeshiya Sabha Building, Addalachenai and Abdul Aziz & Sons Ceypetco Filling Station, 69A & 70 Main Street, Maruthamunai. 
Sharing his views on the two new ATMs, CEO Mohamed Azmeer said With these two new ATMs our customers in the Eastern Province will have greater access to withdraw their funds and will also give us the opportunity to expand the reach of our unique and people friendly concept of banking.
Having commenced banking operations only four years ago, Amna Bank has made strong strides in the competitive banking landscape in Sri Lanka. With a customer base of over 160,000 and growing, Amna Bank has introduced many initiatives to improve its accessibility including off-site ATMs, extended banking hours and Saturday banking.
Amna Bank is the first Licensed Commercial Bank in Sri Lanka to operate in complete harmony with the non-interest based Islamic banking model and is listed on the Diri Savi Board of the Colombo Stock Exchange.
Fitch Ratings recently assigned the Bank a National Long Term Rating of BB(lka) with a Stable Outlook. The Bank was also recognized as the Worlds Best Up-and-Comer Islamic Bank by Global Finance Magazine at the 18th Annual Worlds Best Banks Award Ceremony 2014 held in Washington DC, USA.

CB sets maximum loan-to-value ratio on vehicles at 70%
	
In a bid to clamp down on the vehicle imports weighing on the countrys Balance of Payment (BOP) the Central Bank sent directions to all banks and finance companies imposing restrictions on loans and leases to vehicles.
The directive, which comes into effect from today (September 15), the regulator bars the commercial banks and finance companies granting loans and leases in excess of the 70 percent of the value of the vehicle.
This sets the maximum loan-to-value (LTV) ratio on vehicles at not more than 70 percent.
While the directive is by no means welcoming for the financial institutions as it could restrict growth in their leasing and vehicle lending books, which by far the driving force behind many of the financial institutions, this is a much-awaited measure to curb the menace being created by the unsustainable level of vehicle imports.
However, analysts opine the measure by the Central Bank is too  little, too late as it has already caused much damage to the economy and caste their doubts if the measure will in fact achieve the intended objectives.
Even at present, in most instances, the LTV for vehicles hovers around 70 to 80 percent level.
Therefore, they believe the government most likely will be compelled to increase the import duty on the vehicles either in the November budget or before.
Under these circumstances, according to currency dealers, the impact of capping the LTV on vehicles could achieve very little in terms of reducing the pressure on the rupee because seasonal imports are about to kick in from next month onwards.
Even today the Central Bank was seen intervening in the foreign currency market through the state banks as the rupee hit an all-time low of Rs.140 per US dollar.
Hence, unless the strong dollar flows by way of foreign direct investments materializes during the remainder of the year, the rupee will continue its slide and the BOP will most likely end in a huge deficit.
Last week the Central Bank decided to float the rupee when it realized it could no longer prop up the rupee by selling the countrys reserves.
Since the decision to float the currency, the rupee has fallen over 4 percent by now. 
Sri Lankas expenditure on vehicle imports during the first six months of 2015 virtually doubled to US $ 600 million.
Sri Lankas vehicle imports had been hitting record highs every month till July 2015.
In July, the number of registrations peaked to 62,221 units before it slowed down in August to 50,555 vehicles, largely due to fall in two-wheeler registrations.
Sri Lankas vehicle imports have become a bane socially as everyday road congestion creates mental trauma among the road users while the economic loss has already caused much pain to the countrys external account.

Fitch withdraws Ceylon Income Fund rating; CAM says funds assets of investment grade
	
		 		 
		 
			
Fitch Ratings Lanka yesterday withdrew Ceylon Income Funds (CIF) National Fund Credit Quality Rating of A(lka). CIM is managed by Ceylon Asset Management (CAM).
Following the Securities and Exchange Commission of Sri Lanka not renewing the licence of Lanka Rating Agency (LRA), in July 2015 Fitch placed the fund on rating watch negative.
Fitch said the proportion of the funds assets that used to be rated by LRA was 32 percent at 9 September 2015.
Fitch has withdrawn the rating due to insufficient information as assets previously rated by LRA are no longer monitored. Accordingly, Fitch will no longer provide ratings for Ceylon Income Fund.
However CAM in a separate statement said the funds assets are of investment grade and the LRA suspension is beyond the control of the fund, the fund manger and the underlying listed company. 
The assets of the fund continue to be listed in the Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE), despite the LRA suspension by the SEC. Under the CSE listing rules it is mandatory for listed debentures to have a valid rating in order to be listed on the CSE.
Ceylon Asset Management assures investors of the Ceylon Income Fund that the fund continues to invest in investment grade securities that are listed in the CSE, the CAM statement said.
Fitch continues to rate the Ceylon Dollar Bond Fund (BB-/V5), which is managed by CAM.

It is a well-known secret that this particular Blue party stalwart who once briefly occupied the main chair in the opposition expected a key portfolio of his choice, but finally he had to settle for one with a single subject connected to roads.
However, this Blue stalwart had called at his new office the same day he was sworn in. And the activists of the trade unions affiliated to the two main political parties had decorated the Ministry premises in both Blue and Green in anticipation of the visit of the new Ministerial one. 
On arrival at his new office, the Ministerial one observed that Green was more conspicuous than Blue and that got his goat. He ordered that all Green pennants and streamers be removed immediately leaving only the Blue decorations.
Thereafter, he ordered the Green party trade unionists to leave the premises and asked the Blue party counterparts to present their pressing problems to him. He made critical remarks about his predecessor and also pulled up the secretarial one present on the occasion before leaving the office, they say.
Meanwhile, the Green trade unionists who were chased away had made a beeline to the Green party headquarters where they had planned to stage a protest against the shabby treatment meted out to them.
However, the former Ministerial one who rushed to the scene had with great difficulty dissuaded the TU activists from taking any rash action that could cause embarrassment to the yahapalanya administration.

In a situation where many Betel leaf Diyawanna members were in a mad scramble for portfolios, the new Big Boss found selecting a few suitable persons from among them for Ministerial office a challenging exercise. 
However, there was one particular Diyawanna member whom he wanted to honour with a key portfolio whether the latter asked for it or not. His special choice was none other than the former Chair of the Diyawanna House, who remained simple and unassuming even in those days when his younger sibling was the uncrowned king in the country.
So the new Big Boss had invited the elder sibling to take over the Irrigation portfolio in the new Cabinet. The response he got from the simple sibling was something the new Big Boss had hardly expected. Thank you very much for your kind offer, the former Chair had replied. We are now old people. Why dont you offer this portfolio to a young member keen on getting a portfolio
The new Big Boss had then appealed to the former Chair to at least preside over the District Development Committee when it is formed.

Pivithuru Hela Urumaya (PHU) General Secretary and UPFA MP Udaya Gammanpila said today an Act of Indemnity (AoI) would be presented in parliament as a private member's motion in case the OHCHR report calls for war crimes charges to be levelled against security forces personnel.
The Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) report on Sri Lanka will be published tomorrow. If the report calls for war crimes charges to be levelled against our war heroes, we will present an Indemnity Act in parliament to provide them legal immunity, he told a news conference.
Mr. Gammanpila said an Act of Indemnity was presented by the British Parliament in 1700s to prevent government officials from being questioned in case they had taken measures to protect the country and to maintain law and order.
"South Africa and Bangladesh has also adopted such an Act to protect their officials," he said.
This Act is not something new. Even Sri Lanka has implemented it at least thrice to protect our officials. Once it was brought in 1915 by the State Council with regard to the Sinhala, Muslim riots and twice by UNP governments to protect officials from being questioned for any action taken during the 1977 and 1987 riots."

Pan Asia Bank in green lending push
	
	Completes US $ 20mn funding from Europe based financier
Pan Asia Banking Corporation PLC (Pan Asia Bank) in its mission to contribute towards helping to create a climate-friendly economy has embarked on a green lending drive to fund small, medium and large scale renewable energy and energy efficiency projects, according to a senior official of the bank.
To this end, the bank has completed a funding arrangement with the Europe based green financier, the Global Climate Partnership Fund (GCPF) to obtain a refinancing facility of US $ 20 million (Rs.2.8 billion) for green lending activities.
In view of our strong balance sheet and also proven ability to focus on funding small, medium and large scale green projects, they (GCPF) have indicated willingness even to commit much larger refinancing facilities to us (Pan Asia Bank), said the Deputy General Manager, Treasury, Richie Dias. 
As a responsible corporate citizen, the bank is of the belief that they can make a significant contribution to reduce the negative impact on the environment through its green lending activities.
Apart from that, the green lending drive is also expected help assist the government to achieve its national energy objective of increasing the share of renewable energy up to 20 percent of the energy portfolio by 2020 based on power generation.
Based on the Ceylon Electricity Boards power generation statistics for 2014, the renewable energy sources, barring hydro power contributed just below10 percent to the total national energy mix.
The bank has been working with the Sri Lankas apex government agency for renewable energy, Sri Lanka Sustainable Energy Authority, the private sector energy producers and other stakeholders to identify and promote financing for such renewable energy generation projects.Foray in to larger greenenergy financing
According to Dias the bank is now fully geared to fund larger renewable energy projects and few such hydro power promoters are already in discussion with the bank to secure funding.
Feasibility studies have already been carried out and the bank is in the verge of disbursing funds for the identified projects.
In recent times, the private sector power producers in the country have shown strong keenness in investing on generating renewable energy and many small and large corporates have announced their foray in to renewable energy generation projects.Diversifying green portfolio
Pan Asia Bank was a pioneer in introducing green lending in Sri Lanka when they commenced offering preferential rates for hybrid leasing in 2013. Expanding their mission to further reduce Sri Lankas carbon emissions, Pan Asia Bank has now diversified its green lending portfolio in to areas such as solar, wind and hydro power generation.
According to Dias, any energy saving project or a trade which minimizes the carbon foot print significantly, could now apply for facilities under this loan scheme.
When we initially started green lending few years ago, the biggest challenge we had was to design products which are in line with green concept and to educate the market on the availability of green financing because this was something new to this market back then. Today the hybrid market is matured but the renewable energy generation financing market is still in its infancy. So, now we are looking at diversifying our portfolio in to these areas which have a significant potential, he added. 
The success of Pan Asia Banks hybrid leasing product can be attributed to the preferential interest rates offered as well as the fuel efficiency of the vehicles themselves.
According to GCPF, the annual CO2 reduction for Pan Asia Banks hybrid car portfolio is estimated to have come down significantly. Borrowers are at ease
One significant benefit that the borrowers receive from green lending is the lower interest rates that they can enjoy compared to conventional borrowing. This special benefit is offered in view of the fact that funds are expected to be used in environmentally friendly projects which have minimum environmental impact.
Meanwhile the borrowers also have the option of choosing between fixed rates and floating rate depending on their risk appetite.
The bank hedges the foreign exchange risk in obtaining refinancing from the GCPF in order to be safeguarded from any fluctuations of the foreign exchange rate.
This is a prerogative available only for licensed commercial banks. Therefore if any corporate looks to fund its green project in foreign currency, it is advisable for them to borrow through us because we only can hedge the foreign exchange risk, Dias remarked.Strong investor confidence
The continuous willingness and commitment from globally acclaimed funding agencies such as of GCPF to provide financing to Pan Asia Bank is clear indication of the the foreign investor confidence placed on Pan Asia Bank, Dias said.
Pan Asia Bank was the first to receive a funding line from the GCPF in the whole of South East Asia among a host of other banks, he further said.
Among the institutions backing the GCPF fund are the World Banks private sector financing arm, The International Finance Corporation (IFC), the German Federal Governments Development Bank, KfW Bankengruppe and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Denmark.
We are currently negotiating to further extending our relationship and we are confident that we can secure more funds for furthering our green lending initiatives, Dias added.
Currently the bank is also designing an Environment and Social Policy and a Management System benchmarked to the international best practices. Once operational from the end of this year, the bank is expected to evaluate the environmental and social impact of its lending portfolio more accurately.
Being true to its ethos of driving sustainability, the bank recently converted lighting at its head office in to an energy saving, high efficient LED lighting system.
During the six months ended June 30, 2015, Pan Asia Bank posted an after tax profit of Rs.451 million recording a growth of 156 percent from the same period last year.
During the same period the bank expanded its loans and receivables by as much as 14 percent to Rs.72 billion and operates with an asset base exceeding Rs.85 billion.

They expected thanks, but got a harangue!
	
Soon after the August 17 general election Mangi called a special meeting of the village-level party organizers.
These organizers naturally expected a big Thank you from their leader, but what they got was a searing harangue from him.
The way we campaigned putting our full strength into it, I thought I could easily top the preference list. But Puncha beat me again! Mangi said. Now he faced the organizers no longer concealing his anger: What on earth were you doing when you were supposed to be campaigning for me
Have all those chaps who came here begging for my help to get some job or other voted for me he asked again.
All party activists quietly listened to Mangi and none of them ventured an answer to any of his questions.  
The brainy Puncha who heard what had transpired at the meeting had remarked with a sardonic smile: This is good news. I hope better news is on the way!

Patience is a virtue: UN on Sri Lanka
	
	The United Nations remained tight lipped on the contents of the report on war crimes allegations against Sri Lanka and on the UN stance on the mechanism to be adopted in addressing the issues.
	Responding to a question posed by a journalist during the daily media briefing at the United Nations Headquarters in New York on Monday afternoon, Secretary General's Spokesman Stphane Dujarric asked for patience.
	The report will be out on Wednesday. We will have more to say on that day, he said.
	The OHCHR investigation on Sri Lanka was based on a US-sponsored resolution approved at the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) sessions held last year.
	The UN also remained non-committal on the mechanism to be set up to address the issues raised in the report.
	I think the Secretary-General's position on that has been expressed in the past Mr. Dujarric said without reference to the shift in the political environment in Sri Lanka.
	Earlier, several countries led by the United States called for an independent investigation into allegations of war crimes allegedly committed during the final phase of a bloody civil war which lasted 30 years.
	The report is to be submitted in the backdrop of a shift in the political atmosphere in the country following the shock defeat of former president Mahinda Rajapaksa in January this year.
	The calls for an international investigation were heavily resisted by the former regime led by Mr. Rajapaksa. The nationalist Rajapaksa-led government, was opposed to any western interference into the internal affairs of Sri Lanka.
	The stance resulted in successive resolutions and soft economic sanctions imposed on the country.
	The United States have sponsored successive resolutions at the United Nations Human Right Council (UNHCR) calling the government to address the allegations through a credible mechanism.
	However, the US softened its stance following the change of government during the presidential elections and the subsequent parliamentary election in which the pro-western United National Party (UNP) emerged victorious.
	Assistant Secretary of State for South and Central Asian Affairs, Nisha Desai Biswal during a visit last month to Sri Lanka said that it supported an Internal mechanism to address the allegations.
	The report was to be submitted in March 2015 but was deferred following the change in the political climate in Sri Lanka.
	The UN Human Rights Chief in February said the deferral was due to the changing context in Sri Lanka, and the possibility that important new information might emerge which would strengthen the report". (Hafeel Farisz in New York)

When manape rivalry enters through the door, kinship flees through the window!
	
A scrap between two former Ministerial ones from Sabaragamuwa, a fair one and a dark one (in a literary sense) had created a sensational diversion at the Blue party convention held in Polonnaruwa.
The former Ministerial duo, incidentally close relatives, had fallen out over manape at the recent general poll. However, the immediate cause for the verbal war between them was some issue related to the portfolios they were to get in the new government.
The dark one, generally mild-mannered and soft-spoken, had wanted to call it quits at the initial stage of the heated exchange, but the fair one, normally belligerent and garrulous, had harangued the dark one non-stop throwing restraint and modesty to the four winds.
The fair one was at her vocal best both in sound and fury when an irate former Blue party secretarial one warned her to shut up. This stern order had produced an immediate effect for the belligerent fair one had quietly returned to her seat.

Maithripala wants to end free education-Bandula
	
	Education Minister Bandula Gunawardana yesterday claimed that the proposed policies of the Common Opposition Candidate were a step towards the end of the free education system in the country.
He said Common Opposition Candidate Maithripala Sirisenas manifesto has proposed a soft bank loan scheme for A/L qualified students who fail university entrance by a whisker.
He blamed the media, the Federation of University Teachers Association (FUTA), the Inter University Students Federation (IUSF) and other students, parents and the public for not raising the alarm.
The minister told a news briefing that free education would come to an end by creating a soft bank loan scheme for students to pursue education at private institutions.
He criticized the proposal to integrate Private Schools in the free education system.
This is the end of free education which existed for nearly eight decades in Sri Lanka. The future of the 4.5 million student population, 170,000 teachers and nearly 10,000 public schools is at risk. But sadly no one raises a whimper about this catastrophe and I do not understand why even the media is silence on this. I hope the media will educate the public on this dangerous move before January 8, the minister said.
When a journalist pointed out that even now there were more than 100 first degree, diploma and post graduate degree programmes offered as fee-levying courses at the 15 universities and that the only difference was to grant a soft loan for higher studies, the minister said they were external courses.
The minister said the proposal was a part of the new education programme of the Northern Province Chief Minister C.V. Wigneswaran in line with Eelam ideology which envisages to put an end to the national school system and not to teach the mother tongue but all other languages from grade one onwards.
He said they also want a separate unit for education exclusively in the North including universities not responsible to the central government.
Q Mr. Minister, some 100 degree and diploma programmes in the university system are on a fee levying basis. The difference is that students can obtain a soft bank loan which is highly beneficial to them.
A. No, those are external degrees. This attempt is to offer those courses as internal degrees and thereby privatise university education.
Q Then how can a poor student pursue university education. This loan scheme is aimed at giving a soft bank loan to students who could not afford higher studies.
A. This is the end of free education that existed since 1945 and we must oppose it. The media must educate the public about this disaster.(Sandun A Jayasekera)

The letter of demand sent through Attorney at Law Indula Hewage states:
I write on the instructions of my client Mr. Malik Samarawickrema of 50/24, Bullers Lane, Colombo 7.
My client is a prominent member of the United National Party and a former Chairman of the Party, and is a long standing member of its Working Committee.
He is also a reputed businessman.
I am instructed by my client that a newspaper published by you carried the lead article in its issue of December 28, 2014 on page 1 with the banner headline In a long telephone call to President, MALIK SPILLS BEANS which continued the story prominently on page 2 of the said issue.
Your said article and its headline contain the following statements, inter alia:
(a)  Malik Spills Beans
(b)  How my client telephoned President Mahinda Rajapaksa yesterday at 9.35 am and spilled the beans on how former President Chandrika Kumaratunga manipulated the joint opposition plan to grab UPFA ministers and members to challenge Rajapaksa at the upcoming presidential polls
(c)  How my client had assured the President that the UNP leader would not accept UPFA Deputy Minister Faizer Musthapha who plans to crossover and had also conveyed a request from Wickremesinghe asking the President not to take UNP members.
(d)  My client had further assured that Wickremesinghe will not accept anymore UPFA members into his fold. My client had reportedly briefed the President on how Faizer Musthapha was approached by the joint opposition to convince him to crossover.
(e)  My client had also disclosed a UPFA name list to Rajapaksa with whom Kumaratunga was in touch to attract to the joint opposition.
(f)  Sources said an annoyed President after listening to Samarawickreme had warned the latter not to play double games in politics carrying tales from one side to other and also not to worry him asking for business deals from the government.
(g)  My client struck a deal with the Rajapaksa government earlier on the Colombo - Kandy Expressway project through which he benefitted in massive monetary gains.
(h)  My client had told the President that he and Wickremesinghe were aware that Maithripala Sirisena would get defeated at the January 8, 2015 presidential poll.
(1)  Sources said Samarawickreme had disclosed more details about Kumaratungas plans to grab more UPFA members into the joint opposition.
I am instructed that my client did not telephone the President on the occasion referred to by you in the said article. It was in fact the President who telephoned my client.
I am also instructed that the words/contents of the said article and headline and/or the gist of the article and headline were false and to your knowledge defamatory of my client both per se as well as by innuendo and that you published and/or caused to be published the said words/contents and/or the gist of the words/contents with animus injuriandi and express malice against my client.
My client has instructed me that by your said conduct you have brought him into hatred, ridicule and contempt among members of the public and to cause damage to his public life. I am further instructed to state that you are abusing your power as a media institution with a wide circulation to make grossly defamatory statements against my client who is a prominent member of the United National Party which is the main opposition party supporting the candidature of the Common Opposition Candidate Maitripala Sirisena at the forthcoming Presidential Election to be held on January 8, 2015 at which President Mahinda Rajapaksa is also a candidate, and to defame my client for political purposes and to give wide publicity to such false and defamatory statements against my client.
I am further instructed that the publication of the aforesaid defamatory statements against by client has caused loss and damage to my clients dignity and reputation which my client estimates at Rs.1,000,000,000/- (Rupees One billion).
In the premises I am instructed by my client to demand that you pay to my client the said sum of Rs.l,000,000,000/- (Rupees One billion) as damages within 7 days of the date hereof. Should you fail to pay my client the said sum within the said period, my client will institute action against you for the recovery of the said sum together with interest and costs.

Perpetrator names will never be published by OHCHR
	
	Despite many expecting a naming and shaming in the content of the UN report on Sri Lanka, UN sources in Geneva state that the names of individuals accused of perpetrating the alleged abuses during the final phases of the conflict in Sri Lanka were never intended to be published in the report.
	Sources told Daily Mirror that the names of the accused were never intended to be included as part of the report as the OISL (OHCHR investigation on Sri Lanka) was a human rights investigation and not a criminal inquiry.
	It was pointed out that in the case of Sri Lanka; comparatively few lists were submitted to the investigation panel and that too through zonal investigation commissions as opposed to lists of names that were submitted in investigations such as the Commission of Inquiry on Syria.
	Even in the case of the CoI on Syria and its findings, the list of individuals accused of perpetrating abuses have been handed over to the High Commissioner and sources claim it would continue to remain in his possession alone until a credible, competent judicial investigation is carried out  in which case the names would be passed on to the relevant authorities.
	Therefore, sources said it would be the same course of action that would be followed with concern to those whose names have been involved with perpetrating the alleged abuses during the final phases of the war in Sri Lanka.
	Meanwhile, OHCHR Media Officer Ravina Shamdasani who is currently in Sri Lanka speaking to Daily Mirror on the way forward, following the public release of the OISL report noted that it is time for action in Sri Lanka.
	We hope that the government and people of Sri Lanka will take the time to study the report and perceive its contents in a positive light; as an opportunity and engage with us in ensuring the successful implementation of the recommendations, she said.
	Speaking of the time frame during which these recommendations would be implemented, she noted that while its important to implement them promptly, it is also essential to ensure that the mechanisms are created following broad consultations with all stakeholders involved, particularly the victims, in order to ensure they are designed to succeed.

UN report calls for hybrid court
	
The UN report on Sri Lanka has identified patterns of grave violations in Sri Lanka between 2002 and 2011, strongly indicating that war crimes and crimes against humanity were most likely committed by both sides to the conflict, UN Human Rights Chief Zeid Raad Al Hussein said a short while ago as the much awaited report on Sri Lanka was made publicly available.
	
	The OISL was mandated at the UNHRC in March 2014 through US Sponsored resolution 25/1, which requested the High Commissioner to undertake a comprehensive investigation into alleged serious violations and abuses of human rights and related crimes by both parties in Sri Lanka during the period covered by the Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission (LLRC), and to establish the facts and circumstances of such alleged violations and of the crimes perpetrated with a view to avoiding impunity and ensuring accountability, with assistance from relevant experts and special procedures mandate holders.
	While the investigation was carried out by a group of OHCHR staff, the HC also appointed three experts including former Presidnet of Finland - Martti Ahtisaari, Former High Court Judge of New Zealand - Silvia Cartwright and former President of the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan Asma Jahangir, to play a supportive and advisory role and to provide independent verification throughout the investigation.
	The recommendations of the OISL report included a call for a hybrid court to address war crimes committed by both sides of the conflict. However, the report hasnt cited names of any particular individual responsible for crimes. Follow up criminal inquiry was required to understand individual criminal responsibilities clearly, the report further said.

Democratic Left Front (DLF) Leader and United Peoples Freedom Alliance (UPFA) MP Vasudeva Nanayakkara today opined that it was not wise to create a breakaway party of UPFA as it would pave the way for the Maithripala - UNP alliance to take control of the party.
MP Nanayakkara who refused to accept the leadership of President Maithripala Sirisena in UPFA, instead proposed that the party should contest the provincial council election without the backing of the President.
We have all the liberty to use the name United Peoples Freedom Alliance. Not even the party chairman can take action against us for using the name. The technical issue we will face when contesting is using the betel leaf as it belongs to the party chairman. We will find a separate symbol, an independent one, to contest under, he told a news briefing.
He said no one could take away their right of using party name but said if there were any obstacles, they would still use Peoples Freedom Alliance (PFA) to contest for election. (Lahiru Pothmulla)WATCH

ICRA assigns FCH [SL]A-/stable outlook
	
		 		 
		 
			
ICRA Lanka Limited, a wholly-owned subsidiary of ICRA Ltd, a group company of Moodys Investors Service, has assigned the issuer rating of [SL]A- with a stable outlook to First Capital Holdings PLC (FCH).
ICRA Lanka has assigned the [SL]A- rating to the Rs.500 million Senior Unsecured Redeemable Debenture programme of the company. ICRA Lanka has assigned the [SL]A2+ (pronounced SL A two plus) rating to the Rs.1,000 million Commercial Paper programme of FCH.
ICRA Lanka has taken a consolidated view of FCH and its subsidiaries due to its common brand and senior management team and other operational and financial linkages between the group entities. The ratings factor in the FCHs status as the holding company of First Capital Treasuries Limited (FCTL), a standalone primary dealer in Sri Lanka with issuer rating of [SL]A- with stable outlook).
The ratings take note of the improvement in the business and financial performances of the other group entities, which are engaged in corporate debt structuring, corporate finance, asset management, stockbroking and in extending margin trading facilities, over the recent past.
ICRA Lanka however notes that FCHs performance is largely dependent on the performance of FCTL, as the contribution from the other entities presently is quite modest. FCTL accounted for about 80 percent of the total consolidated asset base of FCH and about 70 percent of its consolidated profit before tax for FY2015. Thus, FCHs performance is expected to be susceptible to the risks inherent in the primary dealer business. The above mentioned risk however is likely to be moderated by the prudent internal control and processes, along with the adequate risk management systems put in place for FCTL. The FCH group has an established clientele of over 2500, which is expected to support the business growth of the other group entities. ICRA Lanka takes cognisance of the comfortable liquidity position of the FCH group given the highly liquid assets and the sanctioned credit facilities from banks with the group entities.
FCH, being a holding company derives its income from the dividends from the group entities and income from its investments, which includes interest income and profit from investments. During FY2015, income from investments accounted for about 60 percent of the total income of FCH (Standalone), while dividend income contributed to the rest vis-a-vis 84 percent of income from dividends in the previous financial year. The increase in the investment income in FY2015 could be attributed to the one-time gain of about Rs.233 following the reclassification of its investment in Orient Finance PLC, which was subsequently sold in June 2015.
The companys standalone performance is largely linked to the dividend income from its principal subsidiary, FCTL and investment income. The expected moderation in the performance of FCTL in FY2016 vis-a-vis FY2015 is likely to impact the overall performance of FCH. The companys funding profile is characterised largely by short-term funding, which accounted for close to 80 percent of the total standalone debt in March 2015, while the remaining was in the form of long-term debentures.
FCHs asset profile (standalone) largely consists of short-term loans funding to its group entities. The companys standalone gearing stood moderately high at about 3.4 times as in March 2015; however the FCH group access to the sanctioned bank lines and its liquid assets provides comfort from a liquidity perspective.
ICRA takes note of the improvement in the performance of the other subsidiaries in the group. First Capital Limited, which is 99.9 percent held by FCH, is involved in corporate debt structuring, corporate finance and advisory services. FCL witnessed an improvement in the performance due to increase in the fee-based income (increased to Rs.127 in FY2015 as compared to Rs.12 in FY2014) arising from the above mentioned services offered, however profitability continues to be driven by the dividend income from the principle subsidiary, FCTL, which accounted for close to 50 percent of the total income of about Rs.1.1 billion, while the remaining was contributed by interest income on its investments.

JVP calls for immediate implementation of political reforms
	
Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake today alleged that the government had begun a process of carrying out their personal objectives rather than taking steps to implement peoples aspirations.
Mr. Dissanayake expressed these views at a news briefing organised by the JVP together with civil society groups and artistes in Colombo to its 20 proposals calling for immediate implementation of political reforms.
Mr. Dissanayake said that civil society groups and political parties worked to bring the present government to power against the actions of the Rajapaksa government in order to bring about political reforms ensure law and order, democracy and bring economic benefits to the people.
He said however the government was deviating from its promises to the people at the last presidential and general elections.
He added that they decided to present a set of proposals to compel the government to expedite delivering promises made to the people at the elections.
Mr. Dissanayake said the government was acting in a lethargic manner with regard to its promise to take legal action against those involved in fraud and corruption.
He said the President or the Prime Minister had no right to evade from the promises made to the people and that they would compel them to implement the governments promises including political reforms.
Mr. Dissanayake said they would submit their proposals to the President and the Prime Minister as well.
The set of 20 proposals by the civil society groups, artistes and political groups included, appointing a parliamentary select committee to prepare a programme to enable Sri Lankan citizens living abroad to vote from where they are domiciled and establishing the Truth and Reconciliation Commission to enable those who were affected by the war to present their grievances, to find out the truth regarding such complaints and to give relief to the distress.
It also included bringing in constitutional amendments to totally abolish the executive presidential system, enforce laws to revoke parliamentary seats of parliamentarians who cross over and abolish provisions that exists in the 19th Amendment to bring the number of ministers to 30 and the number of deputy ministers to 40 and legalise the subjects and institutions of ministries on a scientific basis by bringing in a Parliamentary Act.(Ajith Siriwardana)

Sister of the victim Nuwanthi Kahandaliyanage told the Daily Mirror that they all were protesting to see justice being done to her brother.
He is a youth with special needs but we havent been served justice up until today. The system cant take five years to get the law in to hand, she said.
Today my brother is living in fear and the more these people delay the case the more he will be unable to recall, what exactly happened because that is what his condition is like.
The perpetrators are walking free and everybody has turned a blind eye on this matter, she said.
Kesara Kahandaliyanage was abused, while working at a restaurant and the family was made aware of the incident on June 12, 2015.
A complaint was lodged with the Kohuwala Police and a letter was a written to the Attorney Generals Department but Nuwanthi said they hadnt received any response from them. (Kamanthi Wickramasinghe) Pix by Pradeep Dilrukshana

Video: Mangala confirms int'l role in domestic mechanism
	
	Although a definitive response was not expressed concerning the OHCHR recommended hybrid special court to deal with accountability issues, Foreign Affairs Minister Mangala Samaraweera today confirmed an international role in the domestic inquiry mechanism and added the government plans to conclude the proposed processes within 18 months.
	Addressing the media at a special briefing at the Foreign Affairs Ministry, Minister Samaraweera said he planned to have the consultation processes on the domestic inquiry mechanism underway by the second week of October, upon their return from partaking in the UN General Assembly. The consultations are scheduled to conclude by the end of January in order to facilitate the establishment of the proposed mechanisms.
	The Minister added the four-tiered accountability and reconciliation mechanisms proposed to be set up by Statute during his speech at the opening day of the 30th UNHRC session along the lines of truth seeking, right to justice, right to reparations and non-recurrence, are planned to conclude within 18 months.
	He said all stakeholders would be involved in the consultative rounds including victims, religious leaders, civil society representatives, etc. to make a decision on the constitution and particulars of the proposed domestic inquiry mechanism and on the capacity of international role in the process.
	We would definitely have to seek international assistance on certain areas where necessary expertise might be lacking locally, such as forensic analysis. We hope to determine such necessities and the level of involvement through the stakeholder consultations, he added.
	The Minister said he believed the OISL (OHCHR investigation on Sri Lanka) report was a well-balanced, sober report written with the best of intentions.
	He added however that its contents were a disappointment for those who expected a blood-curdling account and for those who claimed it would be a witch-hunt against the Sri Lanka Army.
	As you can see, the paranoia has been proven wrong. No individual culpability has been declared and the area of prosecution has been referred to a domestic mechanism, he said while adding it is a golden opportunity to restore and protect the credibility of the Sri Lanka Army and distance itself from the negative impression created due to acts of a few who followed orders from the top during the final phases of the conflict.
	He assured those found guilty through the domestic inquiry would be prosecuted irrelevant of their status. The Minister went on to state that it would not be the first instance of Sri Lanka indicting military personnel for crimes as he highlighted examples such as cases of Premawathie Manamperi and Krishanthi Coomaraswamy.
	I believe all member states of the UNHRC including those that sponsored the resolution against Sri Lanka such as the US and the UK have supported the proposed actions and it is a massive victory for us as a country, Minister Samaraweera said.
	Meanwhile, speaking on one of the 23 recommendations made in the OISL report  on the need for a fully-fledged OHCHR presence in Sri Lanka to monitor the human rights situation, the Minister said he had responded to the UNHCR on the matter during which he insisted that they do not perceive the need for a separate OHCHR office to be established in the country but that they had no objection to the existing UN office be further strengthened.(Lakna Paranamanna)WATCH

## Title: UN Members Should Back Hybrid Court

UN Members Should Back Hybrid Court
	
	The call by the United Nations top human rights officer for a domestic-international hybrid court to address allegations of war crimes and crimes against humanity in Sri Lanka should receive strong endorsement by members of the UN Human Rights Council (HRC) in Geneva, Human Rights Watch said today.
	On September 16, 2015, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Zeid Raad Al Hussein, released a report on human rights abuses by Sri Lankan government forces and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) during Sri Lankas civil war. His report calls for the establishment of a special court integrating international judges, prosecutors, lawyers and investigators with an independent Sri Lankan investigative and prosecuting body, defense office, and witness and victims protection program.
	UN member states should strongly support the UN High Commissioners recommendation for a hybrid court as the best way to provide justice for all the victims of Sri Lankas long civil war, said John Fisher, Geneva director at Human Rights Watch. The Sri Lankan government should build on the goodwill of the international community and embrace this important initiative.
	The high commissioners report to the HRC, initially due in March 2015, had been deferred until September to allow Sri Lankas new government to act on a 2014 HRC resolution. The high commissioners report concludes that the High Commissioner remains convinced that for accountability to be achieved in Sri Lanka, it will require more than a domestic mechanism. Sri Lanka should draw on the lessons learned and good practices of other countries that have succeeded with hybrid special courts, integrating international judges, prosecutors, lawyers and investigators.
	The report details credible allegations of laws-of-war violations by both government forces and the LTTE. These include unlawful killings, enforced disappearances, sexual and other gender-based violence, the forced recruitment of children, the unlawful targeting of civilian and other protected objects, unlawful deprivation of liberty, and the intentional denial of humanitarian assistance. Although the Sri Lankan government refused to cooperate with the investigation, investigators for the report received and gathered evidence from a wide range of sources, including victims, national and international nongovernmental organizations, forensic doctors, and other professionals.
	The report corroborates past findings into serious violations during the conflict, including a 2011 report by the Panel of Experts appointed by UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon.
	In offering to provide advice and technical assistance, the report states that Such a mechanism will be essential to give confidence to all Sri Lankans, in particular the victims, in the independence and impartiality of the process, particularly given the politicization and highly polarized environment in Sri Lanka.
	The proposed hybrid court should contain a majority of international judges and have an international chief prosecutor to best insulate the court from improper political and other interference, Human Rights Watch said.
	In addition to a hybrid justice mechanism, the report also recommends that Sri Lanka adopt legislation criminalizing war crimes, crimes against humanity, genocide, and enforced disappearances without a statute of limitations, and to enact command responsibility as a mode of liability. The report also calls on the government to ratify the Convention on Enforced Disappearance and the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court.
	Discussions over the drafting of a resolution on Sri Lanka will begin shortly at the HRC. In their official response to the report, the Sri Lankan government agreed to engage with the reports recommendations. The High Commissioner, in his opening remarks at this session of the HRC, stated that the Council's credibility rested on ensuring an accountability process that produces results, and further noted in presenting his report that previous mechanisms set up by Sri Lanka were almost designed to fail.
	The High Commissioners call for a hybrid court is an important step forward, but it only marks the beginning of the campaign for justice, Fisher said. The credibility of the Human Rights Council and its members depends on ensuring that the recommendations are reflected in a resolution adopted this session, and that the council monitors these recommendations until justice is finally delivered.

Video: One-sided report;Wimal
	
Leader of the National Freedom Front (NFF) Wimal Weerawansa questioned whether the Sri Lankan people were going to allow a Hybrid Court, a branch of the International Criminal Court, to be established here and allow our the war heroes who brought peace and freedom to the country to be taken to the guillotine.
He expressed these views while addressing a special media conference on Thursday at the NFF head office. He opined further that the report of the UN High Commissioner on Human Rights, consisting of 216 pages, dealt with the so-called war crimes that had taken place in the country during 2002-2011, and pointed out that in it serious charges had been levelled against the Sri Lankan security forces.
Conversely, the only charge it had leveled against the LTTE is the proscription of children for the war, and this charge is directed at Karuna Amman, which hints towards an act of revenge as he left the LTTE and helped the army in their war strategies. Though the charges appear to be leveled at both sides, there seems to be only one side that was being targeted here as Velupillai Prabhakaran and the leaders of the LTTE are no more among the living, he pointed out.
He also said that serious charges had been directed at our security forces, alleging sexual and gender-based violence, enforced proscription, brutal use of torture and humiliation, the use of heavy artillery against ordinary citizens and obstruction of humanitarian aid from reaching the people who needed it.
Former Minister Weerawansa questioned as to what the UN Chief aimed to achieve by bringing such serious charges against the Sri Lankan armed forces. His proposal for a Hybrid Court, would contain a majority of foreign Judges and officers assigned with relevant duties. Our own judges would not be able to raise their concerns, and the entire court proceedings would be handled according to their wishes. It was revealed earlier that the functioning of this court would entirely be made with the finances of the UN Human Rights Council, which goes to prove that this would definitely be a branch of an International Criminal Court, despite this court being established in a building based in Sri Lanka, it would be completely under the control of the UNHRC, he warned.

## Title: Pan Asia Banks Rs.4bn debenture issue opens on September 23
## Section: Financial News
## Date: 17 September 2015 03:13 am
Pan Asia Banks Rs.4bn debenture issue opens on September 23
	
What prompted Pan Asia Bank to issue a debenturePan Asia Bank has seen a significant growth in its balance sheet recently. During the first half of 2015 (1H15), our advances grew by over 13 percent.
While the bulk of this growth was funded via deposits, we are also looking to raise medium-term funds through a debenture to further expand our loan book. So, this will not just diversify our funding mix but also will enable us to lock-in guaranteed funding for the medium term.
Apart from that, through this debenture, we seek to minimize possible interest rate risk and also manage the maturity mismatches in our assets and liability portfolio.Can you give a brief account of how well the bank performed in its first half of 2015
We recorded some impressive performance during our first half. Our profit after tax grew by 156 percent to Rs.451 million in comparison to the same period last year. This performance was possible due to the growth in all segments of the bank: retail, SME and corporate banking.
In fact, we have achieved the whole of after tax profit we posted for 2014 financial year (i.e. Rs.415.2 million) in just six months.
If you look at our second quarter profit after tax, it increased by 204 percent to Rs.274 million against the same quarter in 2014.
We were able to record this exceptional performance due to strong growth in our loan book, improved margins and the closer tab on costs coupled with operational efficiencies achieved during the period.
Now, we have grown to become a bank with Rs.72 billion loan book and a Rs.85 billion asset base.
In FY 2014, we recorded over 34 percent growth in our loan book which is among the highest in the banking industry.
One of the biggest achievements during this period is the significant increase in our return on equity (RoE). The RoE rose to 18.38 percent from 9.81 percent within a matter of six months.
At a time when the banking sector RoEs are coming under pressure due to narrowing net interest margins (NIMs) increased to 4.49 percent from 3.82 percent six months ago, which is a significant achievement in this challenging environment.
We intend to record even better performance during the second half of this year and these debenture funds will be used to support this growth.Can you give us more details of your debenture issue
This debenture falls into the category of senior, unsecured debt and will be listed on the Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE).
We expect to issue mainly two types of debentures: fixed rate and floating rate debentures, each having two tenors - three years and four years. So, basically an investor has four options when subscribing to our debentures.
Fixed rate, three-year debenture will carry an interest rate of 9.50 percent (annual effective rate (AER) of 9.7256 percent) while the four-year debenture will carry 10.0 percent interest rate (10.25 percent AER).
Meanwhile, the floating rate, three-year debenture will have a yield of 2.50 percent above the six-month Treasury bill average net rate while the same category, four-year debenture will give you a yield of 3.0 percent above the six-month Treasury bill average net rate.
In all these instances, the investor will receive his interest semi-annually.
What is the purchase price of a debenture and what will be the minimum amount of debentures a person can subscribe to
The issue price of a debenture is Rs.100 and an investor is required to invest in a minimum of 100 debenture (Rs.10,000). An applicant can only apply for one type of debenture under one application. In the event of an oversubscription, the board of directors will decide the basis of allotment.What are the rights that the debentures holder will be entitled to
The debenture holder will receive interest/redemption proceeds in due time. Additionally, the investors have the right to call and attend meetings of the debenture holders as set out in the trust deed.What are the benefits that the debentures will offer to the holder
Investing in debentures will offer the corporates or individual investors with numerous benefits and provide the opportunity to diversify their investment portfolios. The debentures will also provide the investors with regular cash flows in the form of interest payments.
Since the debentures will be listed on the CSE, there will be a secondary market for any investor wishing to exit with an opportunity to do so at the market price prevailing at the time.
The debentures may also be used as collateral to obtain credit facilities from financial institutions and banks.
As per Section 9(0) of the Inland Revenue (Amendment) Act No. 18 of 2013, the income earned by investments made on debentures after January 1, 2013 in corporate debt securities quoted in any stock exchange licensed by the Securities and Exchange Commission is exempted from the income tax, an enormous advantage to potential corporate or individual investors.
Hence, the profits and income earned from our debentures is exempted from income tax as well as the withholding tax.
Further, at a time when the market interest rates are lower, investment in debenture will offer a relatively higher return to investors.Who is managing the issue
Peoples Banks investment banking unit and Pan Asia Bank will act as joint managers to the issue. Deutsche Bank Colombo will act as the trustee for the debentures.Will you be offering purchasing rights to both local and foreign individuals and what would make them eligible to purchase the issues
Yes. The bank has indeed witnessed a good response from the foreign clientele with regard to the debenture investments.What sets the debentures from Pan Asia Bank apart from the other debentures offered to the public
The debentures issued by Pan Asia Bank are rated at BBB (lka) by Fitch Ratings Lanka, which is an investment grade. On the other hand, the bank is backed by strong shareholders and has a dynamic board of directors and a corporate management team and there are opportunities for the investor to grow along with the bank.
Recently we have seen an impressive growth in our advances, which is a significant achievement for a med-sized bank. With our 78 branches across the country and with retail and SME-led growth projections, investors are expected to benefit. Investors may refer the prospectus for further details.Has Pan Asia Bank issued debentures previously and if so, how has the applicant subscription been
Pan Asia Bank previously issued five-year, Rs.3 billion subordinated listed debenture in October 2014. The issue was oversubscribed on the opening day itself due to the overwhelming response from both retail and institutional investors.What is the process an applicant has to follow to apply for the debentures
Applications can be obtained from all trading members and the members of the CSE, managers to the issue, registrars to the issue and all Pan Asia Bank branches. Furthermore, the application form and the prospectus can be downloaded from the official website of the CSE, www.cse.lk and the website of Pan Asia Bank, www.pabcbank.com.

Applications received after the stated period will be rejected despite carrying a postmark dated prior to the closure date.
The applicant must have a valid Central Depository System (CDS) account at the time of submission of application and the allotted debentures will be credited to the applicants CDS account. Hence, the applicant should be aware that the bank will not issue a debenture certificate.

While condemning the statement made by the Chairman of the National Child Protection Authority (NCPA) Natasha Balendra, the Deputy Minister of Social Empowerment Ranjan Ramanayake said he was taking measures to implement a motion in Parliament on September 22 to execute the death penalty again in the country.
Referring to a statement made by the NCPA Chairman Natasha Balendra, the Minister stated that NCPA is disagreeing with the death penalty as prevention to crimes of child abuse and she has suggested that minimum punishment should be ten years and the maximum punishment should be twenty years for those who are convicted of child abuse.
The Minister said as the chairman of NCPA she could not create these kinds of statements to the public because at present people want to execute the death penalty again, especially for child rapists.
Observing such statements made by her, we recognize that she was representing the child abusers side he said. 
Minister Ramanayake stated that he will obtain instructions from President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe before moving the motion in Parliament. He emphasized the public are furious at the incidents that took place recently and said it was time to bring about such laws to stop such crucial crimes.

Arjuna slams Sanga and Mahela
	
	Sri Lankas world cup winning cricket captain Arjuna Ranatunga who is presently the countrys Minister of Ports and Shipping, took a dig at two recently-retired cricket greats Kumar Sangakkara and Mahela Jayawardene at a public ceremony in Nittambuwa yesterday.
	
	Ranatunga alleged that the two former Sri Lanka captains held onto their batting positions in the side for a long period, preventing the opportunity for the youngsters to be groomed, in turn, weakening Sri Lankas batting.
	Today, the discipline of the players has deteriorated completely. I played as the number four batsman and toward the latter part of my career, I moved down to number seven. That was in order to let other younger players have a chance to establish themselves in a batting position. But in the recent past, Sangakkara played at number three everyday. Mahela Jayawardene played at number four. They didnt allow younger players to consolidate those positions, said Ranatunga.
	But I dont put the main blame on the players. I blame the administrators  former interim committee members. What they wanted was to please certain individual players. To let them enjoy personal profits. As a result, we failed to achieve victories as a team. Because of this, we are going to make it a policy for all players to accept playing for the country as their first priority. Money and positions would only be second and third priorities. First and foremost would be to play for the country, claimed Ranatunga.
	Ranatunga also revealed that we might contest the presidency of the SLC at the next election which is expected to be held in November this year. He said his final decision would be announced in two weeks as he is still discussing it with several parties.
	A lot of unwanted things happened in cricket in the recent past. I feel that we have to stop all that and support taking cricket forward. I am closer to the SLC Presidency. I will reveal that later, said Ranatunga.

Envoy assault suspect further remanded
	
Manjula Weerakoon, the suspect who was in remand custody for allegedly verbally abusing and attempting to assault a Russian diplomat at a supermarket car park in Colombo, was further remanded till September 21 by Colombo Fort Magistrate Priyantha Liyanage today.
The victim, first witness in the case, had not appeared in Court today and therefore the identification parade which was scheduled to be held today had been fixed for September 21.
The suspect was arrested by the Colombo Crimes Division (CCD) after his anticipatory bail application was rejected by Court.
He filed an anticipatory bail application through his counsel to pre-empt the possibility of his arrest over charges filed against him by the CCD. (Lakmal Sooriyagoda)

Govt. should probe charges anyway-SF
	
While rejecting a majority of the war crimes charges in the UNHRC report, Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka called upon the government, yesterday, to probe the charges anyway; asserting that there could be isolated incidents which had led to the charges levelled against Sri Lankan security forces personnel.
He said that, as far as he was aware, there had been no killing of civilians who had surrendered during the last phase of the war, as alleged in the report.
We cant accept all the charges as true. However, the charges should be probed in case soldiers had been ordered by another military official to kill civilians. I have no objection to probing the charges, as probing them would clear the name of Sri Lanka if the charges are baseless; if not, action should be taken against the officials responsible, he said at a media briefing.
When asked about his opinion on the UNHRC's call for a hybrid court to probe the charges, he said the suggestion had been made due to the seriousness of the charges, and that it was a great opportunity to probe the charges, with domestic help, in a more open manner.
The Welikada riot, the Rathupaswela protest, disappearances, abductions, the mass graves in Matale and Mannar, and the killing of Raviraj and Ekneligoda had also been highlighted in the report, he said.
He asked people not to panic because of the contents of the report, and said it was the duty of the government and the people to assist in conducting a credible probe. I will provide my support if needed -- in the inquiries and other related areas, he said.
Meanwhile, the Field Marshal criticised the Attorney General (AG) and the AGs Department over decisions taken in connection with some of the court cases, including those involving the Avant Garde Company and the detention of Sajin de Vass Gunawardane.
The AG has become a joke today. Even the UN report had stressed that the legal system and justice, immunity and equality should be strengthened, he said.
He also said the people did not seem to be willing to reject corrupt politicians, as most of the corrupt people had been elected to parliament at the general elections. The people should take the responsibility for this, he said.(Lahiru Pothmulla)

Court bars Presidents TV show
	
The District Court of Kaduwela issued an enjoining order against four television stations from broadcasting a programme titled Janapathi Janahamuwa or a programme of similar nature featuring President Mahinda Rajapakse.
Issuing the enjoining order on an application filed by lawyers for the common opposition candidate Maithripala Sirisena, the District Court barred the Independent Television Network (ITN), Rupavahini, Swarnawahini and Derana from broadcasting the said show.
The lawyers for the common candidate pointed out that January 5th would be the last day for broadcasting propaganda and that if the programme, whether by the name 'Janapathi Janahamuwa' or any other name, was broadcast, the common candidate would not get similar airtime or an opportunity to reply. The enjoining orders prevent the broadcast of 'Janapathi Janahamuwa' by that name or any other name, or any other similar programme.
Lawyers for Sirisena said that the programme was sought to promote the candidacy of the incumbent President and since it was the last day for propaganda, no other candidate would be provided similar airtime.
Ronald Perera PC appeared with Suren Fernando and Nalin Amarajeewa for the Plaintiff.
President of the Bar Association of Sri Lanka Upul Jayasuriya said that the decision was an encouragement to the citizens who strive for an independent judiciary. (Susitha Fernando and Hafeel Farisz)

EC warns of re-poll in case of violence
	
	Elections Commissioner Mahinda Desapriya said today election violence appeared to be increasing and warned that he would have to call for re-polling in areas where such violence continued unabated.
	He told a hurriedly summoned news conference that there was the possibility of election violence rising in the wake of the shooting incidents and attacks reported during the past few days, along with some assault cases. 
	I am sad that this trend of violence is increasing and is a serious form of election law violation, Mr. Deshapriya said.
	Also, he said the prevention of voters from turning up at polling stations, and the collection of their poll cards and Identity Documents were serious offences. He noted he had derived powers to annul the poll in such instances, from a court ruling delivered in 1990s.
	During that period, voters were not allowed to proceed to their polling stations citing security reasons. A fundamental right case was filed. The court ruled against officials responsible for it. There are several important court rulings that legally strengthen my hands in taking action against wrongdoers. There is fear that voters will be blocked this time. I want to allay such fears. I have powers to act in such instances against anyone trying to block voters, he said.
	Mr. Desapriya said only the police personnel would be assigned for election related duties.
	I am sure the military will not be involved in any duty at this election. The Inspector General of Police has assured me his fullest co-operation. Only, the police officers in uniform can carry firearms within the premises of polling stations. Security officers, accompanying political leaders, are now allowed into polling stations, he said.

Kurunegala Bishop plans to resign
	
	The Anglican Bishop of Kurunegala, the Rt. Revd. Shantha Francis said today that he would resign from his position as he, being a Tamil, was under pressure from Tamil Diaspora groups to toe their line.
	Addressing a press conference he said he had always stood for a unitary state and the sovereignty of Sri Lanka and, therefore, had earned the wrath of these groups. He said he had been threatened by them during his visit to London last month.
	I value and stand for the unitary state and sovereignty of the country. I came under pressure from the Diaspora groups due to my position in this regard despite being a Tamil priest. They asked me why I had taken up such a position instead of speaking for the rights of minorities. I have two options  to resign from my priesthood or to embrace their agenda. I will stick to my position. That is to appear for the unitary state and sovereignty of the country. This is what we have achieved after 30 years of war. I will quit my position as the Bishop of the Kurunegala Diocese to serve the interests of the country, he said.
	Asked whether he would take to politics, he said he would not side with any political party but rather serve the interests of the common people.
	He said he was constantly threatened by Tamil Diaspora groups living elsewhere in the world.
	I received threatening letters in London. I faced this problem during the latter half of last month, he said.
	Also, he said he had spoken against the swindling of Rs.138 million at a leading school in Kandy.
	I spoke about it with the school principal and the old boys. But I was threatened and told to stop, he said. (Kelum Bandara and Sanath Desmond)

I will win by huge margin: Mahinda
	
	While expressing confidence that he would win Thursdays Presidential Election by a huge margin, President Mahinda Rajapaksa said yesterday that he would dedicate his third term for the future generation and make Sri Lanka a prosperous, safe and beautiful country for the unborn Sri Lankan child.
Addressing the final election propaganda rally at Kesbewa today the President said he came to Kesbewa after touring the North, East, South and the Central provinces and by the massive crowds that gathered in thousands at UPFA propaganda rallies he was fully confident that he would win the Presidential Election by a huge margin.
President Rajapaksa lamented saying that Common Opposition candidate Maithrpala Sirisena was set to sell the free education in the country by pledging to create a loan scheme for GCE A/L students who failed to enter University to study further.
He pointed out that the Common Opposition manifesto had pledged on page 41 in his manifesto to launch a bank loan scheme for GCE A/L students who failed to enter the university to continue studies further was meant to destroy free education.
This is a covert scheme aimed at charging students from kindergarten level. The manifesto also pledges to re-organize the state administration in line of the Tamasec system in Singapore in order to increase efficiency and productivity in the public sector. But we can still remember that how Chandrika planned to privatize about 40 state ventures and Ranil another 40 which I saved later, President Rajapaksa said.
He said important state ventures like SriLankan Airlines, Pelawatta and Sevanagala Sugar Factories and Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation had been privatized under this scheme which later took over by the government under his leadership.
President Rajapaksa pointed out that former President Chandrika Kumaratunga had sold valuable prime lands in Battaramulla as cheap as Rs. 200 a acre to Ronny Peiris and he re-sold it to Sumal Perera. However, the court after an inquiry abolished the deal and fined Mrs. Kumaratunga as it was a national fraud. The regime under Ranil had decided to prune the public service to 300,000 from 700,000 saying it was a burden to the Treasury but the UPFA government under him has now increased the public service to 1.4 million as the government does not think the public service a burden to the government.
Outlining the development achieved in education under the UPFA government President Rajapaksa said plans were afoot to construct 1,000 Mahindodaya science labs, new technology labs and several University Colleges and also to enroll 100,000 students to universities.
The government has launched the Port City project by reclaiming the sea and creating thousands of employment opportunities. Those mega development projects had been launched without incurring a cent to the Sri Lankan government, he said. (Sandun A Jayasekera)

Two severed heads of dogs have been sent to Brito Fernando and Prasanga Fernando, who are human rights activists, last night.
Speaking to the Daily Mirror, Brito Fernando said the severed dog head was hanging in his gate last night.
Last night, I along with my daughter and my wife went out for dinner around 7.00 pm and got back home at 10.30 pm. By the time we got back I saw three shopping bags hanging in the gate. At first I thought that it is a bag of garbage but when I inspected, I saw something similar to ears of a dog. Since both my wife and daughter were scared I let it be. In the morning when I looked, I found out it was a severed neck of a dog. It looked fresh as the blood was there, he said.
Fernando said he lodged a complaint with the Negombo Police Station.
Later, the same day I got to know that Prasanga Fernando who works with me too faced a similar incident, he said.
He said these acts clearly indicates a warning. And he said he believes people who are supporters of the government behind the incident.
During last October when we were preparing for the commemoration of the disappeared, defamatory posters were put up in Negombo, which carried my face and of other colleagues Victor Ivon and Jayathillake Bandara. Also on October 26 last year, my house was stoned, he said. (Chathushika Wijeyesinghe)

The curtain will come down at midnight for the closely contested and extremely heated election propaganda campaigns for one of the most crucial and decisive Presidential Elections in the recent history of Sri Lanka.

Meanwhile, PAFFREL Executive Director Rohana Hettiatachci said one of the significant factors of this election was the increased incidences of election violence in comparison to 2010 Presidential Poll.
He said by yesterday, there were 740 incidents of election related violence recorded by PAFFREL. 173 of them were of serious nature and 62 victims of violence had been hospitalised, he said.

	In the event President Mahinda Rajapaksa wins Thursdays election, legal action will be taken against foreign agencies and individuals who allegedly funded the common opposition election campaign and induced government members to join the opposition, Minister Dulles Alahapperuma said.
	He told the Governments final news briefing today that the government had identified three foreign hands and certain foreign intelligence arms involved in helping the opposition candidate to win the elections. They will be exposed and punished, the minister said.
	He said the Government had made a mistake during President Rajapaksas second term by failing to take action against those who had reportedly given money and weapons to the LTTE and helped it to kill the countrys political leaders.
	The minister said the conspiracies against the Government had been discussed and hatched in Singapore by foreign and local agents and the government was in possession of video evidence to prove it.
	Opposition attempts to highlight a culture of violence in the run-up to the presidential election to convince voters that the Government has a hand in the attacks is a myth. We have statistics to show that this election is one of the most peaceful elections ever with only 314 complaints being received by police stations up to today. Most of them were minor incidents like the pulling down of banners and tearing of posters, he said. (Sandun A Jayasekera)

Court orders private hospital to release the body
	
		 		 
		 
			
A Colombo court yesterday ordered the management of Lanka Hospital Corporation PLC that a body of a deceased person be immediately released to the close relatives, which was reportedly retained under hospital custody for seven days until the hospital bill was settled.
The deceased Tilak Daluwatta of Ragama, Batuwatta (62) had died in the Hospital on September 11 while he was receiving in-house treatment at the hospital following a by-pass surgery.
While ordering the hospital management to release the body of the deceased person to a close relative, Colombo Additional Magistrate Nishantha Peiris observed that respecting the dead was a matter of paramount importance. He further maintained that there was no legal provision to retain a body under anyones custody and stated that the hospital could take civil action against the parties over defaulting the hospital bill, if the need arose.
A sibling of the deceased had made a complaint with the Narahenpita Police alleging that the hospital management had retained the body under hospital custody since the relatives of the deceased had not paid the bill amounting to Rs.1.4 million.
The complainant told police that his brother was admitted to the hospital on August 25 for a by-pass surgery since they had been informed that the surgery would cost Rs.650,000. He further stated that they took measures to pay a sum of Rs.300,000 at the beginning. He said his brothers health condition started to deteriorate even after the surgery was performed on August 25. He further stated that hospital authorities did not take notice on his request that the patient be transferred to the National Hospital in Colombo. (Lakmal Sooriyagoda)

UNHRC resolution should be turned in SLs favour: Ranil
	
The United Nation Human Rights Commission (UNHRC) resolution should not be publicised but rather diligently turned in Sri Lankas favour, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said yesterday.
Commenting on the UNHRC issue at a ceremony held to mark the 109th birth anniversary of Mr. J. R. Jayewardene last evening, Mr. Wickremesinghe said the UNHRC issue should be handled with care.
Mr. Wickremesinghe referred to a recent report which proposed the passage of an Indemnity Bill to deal with the UNHRC. He said passing such a bill would be disadvantageous to Sri Lanka as the purpose of such legislation would be to pardon those who had committed crimes. Passing and implementing an Indemnity Bill would mean pardoning persons who had committed crimes. Why should we rush to bring in legislation to pardon criminals when we have done nothing wrong and when no one has accused us of doing wrong he said. He said the UNHRC had not said that Sri Lanka had committed war crimes but only made allegations.
He said only thing Sri Lanka need do was to take advice on modalities for setting up the court (from international bodies) and stick to a domestic investigation on the alleged human rights violations; and not involve any international bodies.
Mr. Wickremesinghe said the issues should be handled diligently -- as things were handled by Mr. Jayewardene when he was president. He said Mr. Jayawardenes style of handling things carefully had helped the country to remain undivided. (Yohan Perera)

UN Chief encouraged by SL response to war crimes report
	
United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki Moon has noted that he was encouraged by the response of the Government of Sri Lanka (GoSL) towards the recently released UN report on the country as well as the commitment expressed by the Government to implement effective measures to address issues of accountability.
In a statement issued by the UNSG on Thursday, he stated that he is also encouraged by the commitment expressed by the GoSL to consult widely with all stakeholders in designing mechanisms to address the existing issues pertaining to alleged abuses that occurred during the conflict period.
While stating the Secretary-General welcomes the report on Sri Lanka, the statement further adds, He hopes that its important recommendations will help support the efforts of the people and the Government of Sri Lanka to carve a durable path toward long-lasting peace and stability and respect for human rights, through a genuine and credible process of accountability and reconciliation that meets international standards. The victims of all communities, their families and the Sri Lankan nation itself demand no less than a full and proper reckoning.
He has also commended the action plan presented by the government at the opening session of the 30th UNHRC session while urging the Government to continue building on this positive momentum and the international community to support Sri Lanka in this regard.
It was during a media briefing last afternoon that Foreign Affairs Minister Mangala Samaraweera said that the four-tiered accountability mechanism presented by the government of Sri Lanka to which includes a domestic inquiry process, would be established by end of January 2016 following consultations with all stakeholders on its design and particulars.
He also confirmed an international role in the process in the capacity of expert advice and technical assistance. The proposed four-tiered mechanism activities are planned to conclude within 18 months. (Lakna Paranamanna)

UNHRC report Milder  than expected- President
	
President Maithripala Sirisena said yesterday the report on Sri Lanka presented at the ongoing UNHRC sessions in Geneva was 100 or even 1,000 times less harmful than the report that would have been presented at the UNHRC if not for the change that took place on January 8.
At a meeting with the Editors and media organization heads at the Presidents House, the President flanked by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and Foreign Minister Mangala Samaraweera said the action taken by the government to address Human Rights and Governance issues and moves towards reconciliation had resulted in the International Communitys growing confidence in Sri Lanka.
He said there was a danger of several names being included in the report, but the positive image presented to the world by the current government had prevented such an eventuality. The President said the international community had given a good response to the work done by the government where there were many concerns earlier.
He said the government was following a non-aligned foreign policy which was bearing fruit and that the 19th Amendment which pruned certain Executive Powers of the President and broadened the democratic space was not only beneficial to the citizens of the country but also built up Sri Lankas image internationally.
The President said it was best for the country to have a government without Mahinda Rajapaksa to move forward and added that certain extremist elements were trying unsuccessfully to create problems.
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said the names did not come up in the UNHRC probe report because of the hard work of the government in the international front. He said it was the successive steps taken by the previous Rajapaksa regime after it entered into an agreement with United Nations Secretary General which led to the probe on Sri Lanka. 
The Prime Minister said he was not even given a chance to meet the UN Secretary General when he came to Sri Lanka at that time and when he saw the agreement which was reached he knew it was going to be troublesome for the country.
He said now the current government was working in a positive manner to deal with those issues and address the concerns through a domestic mechanism and that the matters would be dealt with after the Paranagama and Udalagama commission reports are presented. Foreign Minister Mangala Samaraweera said on October 30, the international community which was divided over Sri Lanka earlier would stand behind the country in a united manner.
Justice and Buddha Sasana Minister Wijedasa Rajapakshe and Media Minister Gayantha Karunatilleka were also present at the meeting.

The Centre for Monitoring Election Violence (CMEV) said yesterday there had been a rise in major incidents of election violence between November 20 and January 5 whereas the number of incidents of election violence seemed to have dropped when compared to the previous elections.
The CMEV Coordinating Secretary D.M. Dissanayake said it had documented 420 incidents of election violence with 237 categorised as major incidents while 183 as minor incidents.
He said the highest number of major incidents was reported from Jaffna District with 22 incidents followed by Badulla, Kurunegala and Kandy with 19, 18 and 17 incidents respectively.
Mr. Dissanayake said CMEV had recorded 26 incidents involving firearms and 03 incidents of petrol bombings.
He said CMEV had recorded 132 incidents of gross misuse of State resources for election purposes with excessive use of State media by the incumbent and very limited airtime for opposition candidates.
Mr. Dissanayake said a vast number of incidents of violence and flagrant violation of election laws were attributed to the ruling party where local politicians including local government members were involved.
A large number of incidents of attacks had targeted opposition party offices and persons connected to said offices, he said.
Mr. Dissanayake said the police had been biased for the ruling party and said they had been inactive in arresting the suspects with most suspects arrested for election violence related incidents had been released without following due process. (Ajith Siriwardana)

Mr. Rajapaksa expressed these views when he came to the Presidential Commission of Inquiry appointed to investigate serious acts of fraud, corruption and abuse of power, state resources, and privileges (PRECIFAC) yesterday, to give a statement over the Rakna Lanka armoury.
Mr. Rajapaksa said he has had to report to all these commissions as a result of ending the war.
Today I feel sad to have finished the war. I have had to report to all these commissions just because I finished the war. None of these commissions would be there, if I had not finished the war, he said.
Mr. Rajapaksa said he might have to report to the UNHRC as well to give statements following the release of the UN report over the alleged war crimes.
He said the UN report was totally based on the needs of the Tamil Diaspora and said what the Diaspora wanted was to punish the security forces and the then political leaders.

Ill throw the book at the book mafia: Ranil
	
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremeisnghe yesterday pledged to confront the text book mafia which prevented students from gaining access to quality text books.
At the opening of the Colombo International Book Fair at the BMICH yesterday, the Prime Minister said the Education Ministry was involved creating a monopoly of few publishers leaving out those known for quality text books.
Our government will be accused of giving contracts to mudalalis but we will have to find good publishers who are prepared to supply quality text books, he said.
The Prime Minister said unlike in the past, today's students had been deprived of reading books by famous authors like Martin Wickremesinghe.
Martin Wickremesinghe may be thrown out of the Education Ministry if he happens to offer his books to the ministry in this time and age, he said.
The Prime Minister said the allocation of funds to schools would be increased to ensure that schools would be in a position to buy quality text books and books for school libraries.
He said only 15 per cent of the funds allocated to school books was used for the purpose with a greater share spent on travelling, fuel and for other administrative purposes.
The Prime Minister said said there should be a balance between the new technology and the book-publishing tradition.
The new technology has given the people the opportunity of reading books on the internet but one has to maintain a balance between the old and modern ways, he said.(Yohan Perera)

The tail of AirAsia Flight 8501 has been found in the Java Sea, the head of Indonesia's search and rescue agency said Wednesday.
"The tail has been found," Bambang Soelistyo, chief of the rescue agency, known as BASARNAS, told reporters at a news conference, adding that tail numbers were visible on wreckage. Finding the tail is significant because it may contain the plane's voice and data recorders, or black boxes. Soelistyo said no black boxes have yet been found.
Tony Fernandes, CEO of AirAsia, said on Twitter Wednesday that "if right part of tail section then the black box should be there."
"We need to find all parts soon so we can find all out (sic) guests to ease the pain of our families," Fernandes said. "That still is our priority."
The Airbus A320 disappeared on Dec. 28 with 162 people on board as the jet flew from Surabaya to Singapore. The pilot had requested a course change due to bad weather just before contact was lost, officials have said. 40 bodies have been recovered so far.
If the black boxes are located, they would contain "maybe 90 per cent of the information you need in the investigation," Jean-Paul Troadec, who was in charge of the official French air accident investigation agency at the time of the Air France 447 crash, told NBC News. (nbcnews)

He said that four Police officers in uniform stood by watching the assault and did not intervene to prevent them being assaulted.
The two of us went to eat at this shop near the Alba showroom in Maligawatte. I was inside the boutique sipping tea, when my friend had got into a conversation with around three people outside. My friend backs Presidential Candidate Maithripala Sirisena, he said.
Explaining the incident, Amith said that he went outside the shop, having heard a ruckus.
I heard noises and saw my friend being assaulted by two men who were there.
I ran outside and they began assaulting me as well. My friend shouted out that I am a journalist and then the men said Umbala wage un thamai hoya hoyahitiye, athepaye hiriara ganna (We were looking for people like you to let go of some steam) he said.
Amith said that four Police officers were present during the incident.
Four Police officers of the Maligawatta Police Station watched the entire incident but did nothing to prevent us being assaulted. They were in uniform and stood still.
After the assault the three men got into a van and fled. Thereafter, the Policemen came towards us and I asked them as to why they did not take any action. They told us that these were men from the Presidential Security Division and could do nothing, he said.
Thereafter, the journalist and his friend had been taken by the Police to the Maligawatta Police Station, where they had lodged a complaint, before he was admitted to the National Eye Hospital for injuries in the eye.

The price of a heroin kilo which was about 7.5 million rupees had recently increased drastically up to Rs. 10 million because of frequent raids carrying out by the Police Department, he said.

Govt. concerned over misplaced UN statement
	
The Government had expressed its concern over the recent remarks of the Spokesperson of the Secretary-General of the United Nations recalling the Secretary-Generals call to the Government to ensure that the forthcoming Presidential elections were peaceful and inclusive, a media release said today.
The Government of Sri Lanka notes with concern the recent remarks by the Spokesperson of the Secretary-General of the United Nations recalling the Secretary-Generals call to the Government to ensure that the forthcoming Presidential elections are peaceful and inclusive.
Issuing the statement the External Affairs Ministry said that the spokespersons comments were gratuitous and inappropriate.
Sri Lanka has a vibrant tradition of democratic practice since 1931 and has been conducting elections at regular intervals, in a peaceful and orderly manner, while the electorate has continued to cast their vote freely, in large numbers.
In keeping with this decades-old tradition, the Presidential Election of 2015 too is being held in a peaceful and orderly manner. The inclusiveness of the elections is guaranteed for all Sri Lankans and all minorities are equally facilitated to actively participate in the election process and exercise their franchise.
The Commissioner of Elections is an independent authority, and as mandated, has guaranteed that the elections would be held in a free and fair manner. There is a large contingent of international election observers present. In this context, repeated calls for a free and fair election in Sri Lanka are misplaced, the statement added.

Oman Air launches Shape and Size efficiency programme
	
Oman Air has launched an efficiency programme, entitled Shape and Size, with the aim of achieving substantial reductions in the airlines expenditure.The move is timed to coincide with the start of 2015 and the onset of new budgets for the year.
The Shape and Size efficiency programme is targeting cost reductions across all activities undertaken by the national carrier of the Sultanate of Oman. None of those reductions will affect the airlines safety or the high standards of service offered to valued customers.
A total reduction in expenditure of more than 100 million OMR should be achieved by Oman Air over the next three years, bringing the company to an operational break-even point by the end of 2017.
The Chief Executive Officer of Oman Air, Paul Gregorowitsch said: We are determined and committed to reshape Oman Air to become a more modern business driven enterprise- one that does not solely rely on financial injections from the Government of Oman.
Oman Air contributed almost 420 million OMR to the Gross National Product of the Sultanate during 2014. We are also aware that we have to contribute to the infrastructure of the country by serving domestic airports like Sohar. Furthermore, and in line with the nations Omanisation policy, we are committed to developing for the future the educational and career potential of young Omanis. These important duties do not, however, constitute an excuse to run the airline as though it is a hobby.
We all have to work hard and to make sacrifices to become an even better, service oriented, but self-supporting airline. We are in business to be customer and profit-driven.On January 15th, more than 400 Oman Air employees are to attend To become the best, a global event held in Muscat. Here they will be briefed on how to contribute more effectively to the development of an efficient, profitable and respected airline.

Pope will arrive here on Jan.13
	
The Catholic Church in Sri Lanka yesterday called for a peaceful post-election environment to enable a smooth papal visit next week.
Fr Cyril Gamini who is the secretary of special secretariat set up for the popes visit made this appeal on behalf of the Catholic Church told a media briefing that the visit would not be cancelled or postponed for any reason.
He denied reports published recently particularly in the social media that there were divisions in the Church with regard to the Popes visit.
"There are no divisions in the church as suggested by some," he said and urged all Catholics to pray for a memorable and successful papal visit.
Visitors from Goa and other states in India, Thailand and even from Europe are expected to arrive in the country for the papal visit. In addition 1,000 journalists from foreign countries including a team from the Vatican print and electronic media and a large number of cardinals, bishops and priests are also expected in the country.

SLT denies that election results could be cooked
	
Sri Lanka Telecom PLC (SLT) today categorically denied an item published on a website alleging that those who know the SLT terminal line password could alter the results of todays presidential election.
SLT Group Chief Executive Officer Lalith De Silva, at a hurriedly called media briefing at the SLT Head Office in Colombo, said that they were making arrangements to take legal action against the particular website.
Initially, as was our duty, we informed Elections Commissioner Mahinda Deshapriya on Wednesday about the issue. He called us for a meeting yesterday, where he also agreed that the allegation was false and condemned the act. We will decide what legal action to take against the website later on, he said.
He said Mr. Deshapriya had averred that his decision to assign the SLT as the telecommunication network provider for election purposes was taken because of the trustworthiness of the company.
Mr. Silva said that these allegations at a time close to the poll would damage the image of the company and also impact on the credibility of the poll results, especially internationally.
Elaborating, Chief Network Officer Priyantha Fernando said they were in no position to alter the election results but that those who didnt sufficient technical knowledge would be misled by the article.
The article specifically says that the SLT could only alter results by faxes. This is not possible and is a completely false statement. We dont connect routers to the PSTN as alleged in the article. And even if the fax were altered, the emails and the results received through other means would be the same, he said.  (Lahiru Pothmulla)

The representatives of Indian Fishermen Associations had requested local fishermen organisations to hold a discussion over the allegations that the Indian fishermen poached in Sri Lankan waters using trawler vessels.
The Consultant of the Lankan Fishermen Association Vinayagamurthi Sahadevan had told media that they didnt believe in a proper solution for the problem by discussing it with the ordinary fishermen associations since discussions held between Sri Lankan and Indian Prime Ministers on the issue had concluded without any proper solution.
At least there should be groups of government representatives from both sides in holding such discussion, so that the integrity and legality are protected. Otherwise, we are not willing to hold any discussion with their organisations, he said. (Romesh Madushanka)

Bishops resignation not related to poll: Church of England
	
	The Archbishop of Canterbury had not sought to influence the outcome of the Sri Lankan presidential election, a media statement said today.
	Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby was referring to reports with regard to the resignation of Bishop of Kurunegala Rev. Shantha Francis said he had not sought to influence the outcome of the presidential election.
	"Any suggestion that the Church of Ceylon or Archbishop of Canterbury was seeking to influence the outcome of the Presidential Election in Sri Lanka is categorically untrue," he said in the statement.
	"The visit by Bishop Shantha to Canterbury last week was to consider with him the various options for dealing with his position as a Bishop, who had voluntarily stood down following numerous complaints.
	A particular cause of concern was his involvement in unresolved criminal proceedings relating to misappropriated pension funds. Members of his own Diocesan Standing Committee had requested that he should resign and he agreed to do so, the statement said.
	The Anglican Church in Sri Lanka has had a long and honourable history as a force for unity throughout the whole period of civil disturbance on the Island. Successive Bishops of both dioceses have used their influence to build relationships between the communities, maintaining the Churchs reconciling mission across the nation.
	That unifying mission has the full and unqualified support of the Archbishop of Canterbury and is wholly aligned with his own emphasis on reconciliation in every aspect of his own ministry, across the world, the statement added.
	The Archbishop of Canterbury is the senior bishop and principal leader of the Church of England, the symbolic head of the worldwide Anglican Communion and the diocesan bishop of the Diocese of Canterbury. The current archbishop is Justin Welby.

However, workplace identity cards are not accepted. Likewise, we will not accept receipts issued when applying for NICs or photos certified by Grama Niladharis.
Those without any valid identity document can get a temporary identity document certified from the nearest election office. There is still time for it, he said. In addition to NICs and Passports, the special identity cards issued for senior citizens, retirees and the clergy are considered valid identity documents and will be accepted at polling stations.

Salaries of Lankans in Qatar through bank accounts
	
From November onwards, the salaries of Sri Lankans employed in Qatar will no longer be paid in cash but through bank accounts, the Foreign Employment Ministry announced today.
This has been decided by Qatar Labour and Social Services Minister Abdulla Saliya Al Khulaifi after discussions with Foreign Employment Minister Thalatha Athukorala during her recent visit to the Middle East.
The Qatar minister said the new move would ensure that the employees salaries were safe and secure. He said there had been several complaints when salaries were paid in cash.
"With this move, we hope to resolve complaints about employers not paying the stipulated salariesto employees or failing to pay their salaries altogether," he said.
Minister Athukorala thanked the Qatar Labour Minister and said the ties between Sri Lanka and Qatar would be strengthened with talks to be held in December between the two countries.
She said action would be taken against those who continue to remain in Qatar despite the expiry of their work visas. 
The minister said though some 145,000 Sri Lankans were employed in Qatar, only107,000 have registered withour Embassy in Qatar.
During her visit, she also met Sri Lankans who were displaced after having had problems with their employers. The minister assured that arrangements would be made to bring them back to Sri Lanka as soon as possible. (Piyumi Fonseka)

Bridge will make SL another Indian State: Gammanpila
	
Pivithuru Hela Urumaya (PHU) General Secretary and MP Udaya Gammanpila today criticised the move by India to create a bridge connecting Sri Lanka and charged the link would only work in favour of India ultimately making Sri Lanka another State of India.
He said India had requested a loan of USD 5.2 billion from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for the project but not once mentioned that Sri Lanka too have to share when paying the loan.
This is clear evidence that the project if monopolised by India to solve their issues, to send their people to Sri Lanka. Just like there is a Great Wall to protect China, the Indian Ocean protects our island. If the project went ahead, our sovereignty will be destroyed. President Maithripala Sirisena will end up being a Chief Minister of one of Indias States, MP Gammanpila told a news briefing.
He said that it was not strange to create bridges or tunnels linking countries as there are already such arrangements between France and England as well as between Sweden and Denmark. However, he said if to be linked, two countries should possess similar characteristics.
The unemployed population in India is about 50 million while there are 400 million of poverty stricken people. India has a habit of sending their unemployed people overseas. If their people who are willing to work for less salary than ours arrive here, we will face grave repercussions. National security and economy will be threatened, he said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

CALs key insights on IPOs  how to take your company public
	
		 		 
		 
			
Capital Alliance, Sri Lankas leading full service investment bank, has enabled several companies in the country to prepare for and successfully execute their Initial Public Offering (IPO). CAL celebrates 15 years of success in Sri Lanka this year and is currently the countrys market leader in IPOs, raising Rs.10 billion for clients since 2010.
Providing corporates and investors with an in-depth understanding of how IPOs work and benefit companies, CAL Head of Investment Banking Deshan Pushparajah shares his insights.
Pushparajah is an expert at public and private capital markets, both buy-side and sell-side mergers and acquisitions, and enjoys the trust of an established network of clients in the local and international capital markets. He has been with the CAL group since 2007 and has overseen the Investment Banking unit through a challenging post-conflict period. He has also been instrumental to CAL emerging as a market leader in both equity and debt capital markets. Deshan is a CFA charterholder (USA) and a Fellow Member of both the Chartered Institute of Management Accountants (UK) and the Association of Chartered Certified Accountants (UK).
Understanding what an IPO is and what it entails: Describing an IPO in greater detail, Deshan Pushparajah stated, An Initial Public Offering, or IPO, is the first sale of stock by a company to the public. In Sri Lanka, an IPO is offered to the public through the Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE).
The investors of an IPO range from local and institutional fund managers to retail investors and corporate clients. The shares continue to trade on the CSE subsequent to the offer. An IPO can take the form of an Offer for Subscription, where the company seeks to raise new funds or an Offer for Sale where an existing shareholder choses to divest part of his holding in the company. Companies can also list on the CSE by way of an Introduction, where no shares are offered to the public but they become tradable subsequent to the same.High-profile global and local IPOs
Most of the top 10 global IPOs have all hailed from the Asian region, most recently Alibaba, the diversified e-commerce company went public in 2014 and raised a staggering US $ 25 billion  and became the largest IPO in history. In 2010, the ABC Bank, otherwise known as the Agricultural Bank of China raised US $ 22 billion and ICBC Bank of China, NTT DoCoMo a Tokyo-based telecommunications player, Visa Inc. and AIA, a Hong Kong-based investment and insurance company, all raised over US $ 17 billion with their IPOs. The Facebook IPO in 2012 raised US $ 16 billion and in 2010 General Motors raised US $ 15 billion with its IPO.
Locally, CAL has handled the largest IPOs in Sri Lanka including the largest post-war IPO for Peoples Leasing Company PLC which raised Rs.7 billion and IPOs for other leading corporates such as Laugfs Gas PLC, Renuka Agri Foods PLC and Vallibel Finance PLC amongst many others.IPO benefits
An IPO has benefits for both the company as well as its existing shareholders.The company benefits from gaining an alternate, significant source of equity capital and greater visibility. Outlining the other benefits of an IPO, Pushparajah stated, Through an IPO, the shareholders of a company benefit from being able to establish a value for the asset they have been instrumental in creating whilst also creating ready liquidity should they wish to monetize part of the same. Listings become a transformative period for most companies and during this time, companies can formalize and lay the foundation for future growth. It also helps family companies deal with succession planning and enables them to attract the best talent to the firm.Risk of losing company control through an IPO
Many companies are hesitant to issue an IPO because they fear that they might lose control of the company. Commenting on this Pushparajah stated, This is a common myth when it comes to listings. For an IPO, you only have to dilute a minimum of 10 percent to the public and at best you can dilute up to 49 percent of the company without losing absolute control of the company. Whilst you will now have other minority shareholders, whose welfare you should always be concerned about, they will always be just that  the minority.CALs role in an IPO
CAL has been a dynamic force in Sri Lankas investment banking and finance arena and has helped many leading corporates to successfully issue IPOs and reach new levels of growth and success.
Commenting on how CAL gets involved in issuing an IPO Pushparajah stated, Our role is to hold your hand throughout the entire IPO journey and ensure that it goes as smoothly as possible for you. Starting with helping you to structure your company, we also help you put the house in order and prepare the management for public life. We then put together the complex legal documentation required by the Stock Exchange and the SEC on your behalf.
However, the main aspect of our value addition is in helping you place a value on the asset that you have painstakingly created and we thereafter engage with investors to convince them of the future potential of your company. We reach out to investors with varying motivations and those across multiple geographies to ensure that you have a nice mix of partners in your future story.
We dont stop there though. Subsequent to an IPO, we continue to work with you to ensure a constant engagement with investors and to ensure that the share price fully reflects the present and future success of your company. This will help you return to shareholders even at a later date in order to raise more funds from them.How to prepare for an IPO
Outlining what needs to be done to issue an IPO, Pushparajah stated, The first step is to make the decision to list your company. It is obviously a life-changing one, so we can engage with you from this early stage to prepare you for its implications. Once you make this decision, we can help you navigate the next-steps. Our forte is in family businesses and we have immense expertise in helping them sift through complex family complications in order to deliver the best outcome and ensure the best value for everybody involved.

	UNP Parliamentarian Hirunika Premachandra today said she was uncertain as how to address former President Mahinda Rajapaksa since he was also now an ordinary parliamentarian.
	Mahinda Rajapaksa lost his reputation because of his extreme hunger for power. If he stayed at home without contesting the parliamentary election, we could have still addressed him as the former president. Now I am in a dilemma as how to address him, whether to call him Manthri Thuma (parliamentarian), sir or former president. He is just a parliamentarian like any of us now. Other parliamentarians also call him Manthri Thuma, she said.
	Addressing a meeting in Wellampitiya yesterday, she also said the actions of the new government were very silent in comparison with the previous government and added the political culture in the country was now taking a new leap.
	We like to have decent ministers with simple political principles. They should be able to travel in their vehicle only with their driver and not with a security squad, unless their lives are under threat, MP Premachandra said.
	She said President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe had already shown by example how to create a Yahapalana government. (Chaturanga Pradeep and Indika Sri Aravinda)

	Former JVP Leader Somawansa Amarasinghe today said the party Central Committee had decided four years ago to allocate Rs. 10 million to provide a house for the family of its founder Rohana Wijeweera if they were evicted from the Naval quarters in Welisara.
	Commenting on the recent decision to evict Mr. Wijeweeras family, he said this was the second occasion where an eviction letter had been issued.
	The same notice was issued while I was the JVP leader four year ago. The party made a decision back then to allocate Rs. 10 million to provide a new house for the family. The funds should still be there, I hope so. It is good thing if the JVP is willing to take the responsibility of the family. All the JVP is left with today is to implement the party decision. It seems they have enough money to spend for electioneering lately so I believe they have no monetary issues, he said.
	Upon receiving the eviction letter four years ago, he said Mr. Wijeweeras family had made a plea to postpone the eviction date, which was obliged.
	While claiming that he didnt see the new eviction letter yet, Mr. Samarasinghe, now the Secretary of the Peoples Servants Party said the government should take responsibility of providing security to the family members of late Mr. Wijeweera.
	He reminded how Mr. Wijeweeras family handed themselves over to the government on the assurance of providing security following the arrest and assassination of Mr. Wijeweera.
	We can provide the family a new home but still we cant provide the security which is being provided by security forces. I still believe there are threats to Mr. Wijeweeras family members as JVP members who fought against separatism and foreign invasions had not been meted out with justice yet, he said.
	Mr. Amarasinghe said he had another solution to solve the issue. I will reveal it today (22), he said. (Lahiru Pothmulla and Indika Sri Aravinda)

Limiting vehicle leasing rate: Temporary measure to reduce new vehicles
	
Transport Deputy Minister Asoka Abeysinghe said the government made it compulsory to pay 30 per cent of the value of a vehicle to the leasing company when purchasing a vehicle on lease and it was just a temporary measure to reduce the number of new vehicles registered and not to create hardship to the purchasers of vehicles.
Addressing a meeting of the Atugalpura Journalists Association he pointed out that one could take away a vehicle on lease without making an initial payment, but now the purchaser should pay 30 per cent of the value of the vehicle.
Statistically over 5 million families live in Sri Lanka, but 6 million vehicles have been registered. At present 600,000 motorcars, 3.2 million motorcycles, one million trishaws, 100,000 buses have been registered and this has created severe traffic congestion in the main roads. The government has proposed to reduce the staff of the SLTB through voluntary retirement. The SLTB has not paid ETF contributions since 2010. However, 7,000 new employees have been appointed for the period. At present the SLTB has 36,700 employees for 6,500 buses. The government is planning to streamline the affairs of the SLTB he said. Public transport services in any country are not profit making enterprises but they are not running at a loss. However, in Sri Lanka public transport services are running at heavy losses he said.

The suspect who pushed his wife and youngest daughter into the sea, in a confession to the police, said that he had wanted to get rid of his wife so that he could marry a woman who he had not even seen.
He said the woman, who had identified herself as Madushika, was from Kurunegala, but he had not even seen her to date. He explained that he had got her phone number by accident, after he dialed a number incorrectly.
He was arrested by the police on charges of pushing his wife and daughter into the sea at Mahapalana in Kosgoda. The child drowned in the sea while his wife survived the fall. He however explained that he had not intended to kill his daughter and that he was forced to do so because when he asked his wife to hand the child over to him she had refused to let go of her and a result both had fallen off the rock after he pushed his wife over.
He had previously asked his wife to take the younger child to the beach with them so as not to arouse suspicion that he was going to harm her. (Hemantha De Silva)

Ms. Wijeweera hits out at JVP attitude towards them
	
	The late JVP leader Rohana Wijeweera's widow Chitrangani today said she wondered how the JVP was now saying that the party would take care of her family, since the party had failed to look into the well-being of her family for the past 26 years.
The widow and children of the late JVP leader had been asked to vacate the Navy quarters they had been occupying in Welisara on October 1.
Earlier, the partys general secretary Tilvin Silva said the JVP would continue to provide protection to the family. He said the party had been providing them with their requirements in the past as well and would continue to provide such relief and accommodation in the future.
In an interview with the Lankadeepa newspaper yesterday, Chitrangani said she was condemning statements made by the JVP as all of them were just lies. We were at the naval headquarters at Welisara for the past 26 years. The JVP didnt bother to take us out, although they had the chance to do so. Now they are just making these comments for their own benefits, she said.
Hereafter I will not shut my mouth, although they managed to shut my mouth and my children during the past 26 years, she said.
She also said when she requested to send their family overseas few years ago, Tilvin Silva rejected it. I also requested the same from Nihal Galappatti and Somawansa Amarasinghe, but they too rejected it, she said.
She also accused the JVP of not requesting an investigation into the death of their former leader Wijeweera and other murdered members of the JVP in 1989. But now they (JVP) are demanding investigations into the deaths of Tamils in the north, she accused.
She also said that she tried to contact JVP Leader Anura Kumara almost everyday day since he became the leader of the party. But he (Anura) didnt answer my phone knowing that I was calling, she said.
She said that leaving the Naval quarters at Welisara was upto them to decide as she was going to discuss the matter with the government. But I am telling the JVP not to make any comment about us anymore as we will solve our problems somehow, as we dont have any trust on the JVP anymore, she added.
Mr. Wijeweeras widow and six children handed themselves over to the Army Headquarters following the assassination of Wijeweera in 1989.

	Minister of Finance Ravi Karunanayake today denounced the claim made by a consumer rights group that there is a move to increase the import taxes on paper and the taxes charged from the advertisements in electronic media.
	The Minister said one must not waste time responding to these false statements.
	He made this remarks responding to a query made by the Daily Mirror with regard to a statement made by Consumer Rights Protection National Organisation that there is a move to increase the import taxes on paper and the taxes charged from the advertisements in electronic media.
	Consumer Rights Protection National Organization President Ranjith Vithanage told Daily Mirror that increase in import taxes of paper used for printing may result in increasing of newspaper prices as packaging may cost more for the producers. Accordingly he said the price of weekly news papers will increase further from the current price of Rs 60. This he said will indirectly affect the peoples right to information as the news papers is the most common and easy way for the people to get information.
	Mr. Withanage said there is a move to increase the taxes charged for advertisements in the electronic media, the association urged the government to re-think about this decision. (Yohan Perera)

"I look forward to working with President-elect Maithripala Sirisena as his new government works to implement its campaign platform of a Sri Lanka that is peaceful, inclusive, democratic, and prosperous," Kerry said in a statement soon after Rajapaksa conceded defeat.
"I commend President Rajapaksa for accepting the results of the election in the proud tradition of peaceful and orderly transfers of power in Sri Lanka. His words tonight about accepting the verdict of the people and moving forward are important," Kerry said.
Rajapaksa had called the election two years ahead of schedule, hoping to win a record third six-year term before the defeat of the Tamil Tigers fades in the memory of the people of the island which saw a three decades war over the demand of a separate Tamil Eelam.
There was a high voter turn-out for the elections held yesterday.
"The Sri Lankan people deserve great credit on the successful conclusion of their elections. They turned out in great numbers to exercise their democratic rights and every vote was a victory for Sri Lanka," Kerry said.
"The United States applauds the Sri Lankan Elections Commissioner, the security forces, Sri Lankan civil society, and the candidates themselves for making sure this election was not marred by unrest and for ensuring a significant drop in campaign-related violence.

There is a rumour abuzz in political circles these days that moves are afoot to put on the ice a certain court case involving the better half of a prominent opposition politico.
The better half, in fact, had to languish in the hospital of the main state-run lodge for a few days in connection with this case. Both legal and security authorities who were once keen on pursuing this case seem to have lost their interest in it, they say. Some political observers attribute this development to a new political deal in the making. Two Ministerial ones the other day were discussing the present status of the court case in question when one of them quoted the much hackneyed, but ever fresh adage: In politics, there are no permanent enemies or permanent friends!

The former strongman recently enjoyed a long holiday at Pasikuda, a popular national resort on the eastern coastline.
	
He had checked in to a star-class hotel to take a respite from the train of worries that have been visiting him ever since being ousted from office. They say he had his fun in full measure by swimming in calm and shallow waters, jet sking in the surf and even diving in deep waters to watch the corrals. One evening when the afterglow was painting the distant skies in rose and golden hues and the former strongman was taking a stroll along the beach when he espied a familiar figure walking towards him. The other beach walker presently turned out to be none other than the Green party leader, the second in command of the yahapalanaya regime!
There were some people who witnessed the two political rivals warmly greeting each other and engaging in what seemed to be a friendly conversation. But what they had talked about remains a mystery, they say. Many also still wonder whether the duo met on the beach by sheer accident or by design.

He gets sound advice from his leader!
	
This Green one from the East made it to Diyawanna for the first time and was soon raised to Cabinet rank. According to the portfolio assigned to him, he is expected to oversee small industries.
This being a new subject, the Ministerial one wanted to have a clear idea about its parameters and he approached his leader, the second in command of the regime to seek a clarification. But the query had nettled the Green leader. His stern reply was: You have to be innovative. Start new ventures. Look for areas where you can develop the existing ones I acted on my own initiative when I was appointed a Minister in 1977. For instance, start industries to turn out new products out of coconut husk. We may earn millions in foreign exchange by exporting such products! 
Thereafter, the new Ministerial one had complained that he was yet to find suitable accommodation for his office. Pat came the Green leaders answer: Share space with your wife in the building where she now works as a Deputy!

This one despite shouldering the burden of a key portfolio had all along been taking a keen interest in the national cricket chair. And there was a rumour making rounds that he was planning to run for the coveted chair at the election round the corner. However, the new Ministerial one handling Sports had already vowed not to allow any politico to secure the chair of any sports association.
The new Ministerial one in charge of Sports had soon divined the purpose behind his colleagues coming for the ceremony all the way from Colombo and moved to a seat far away from where his colleague was seated and had made it a point not to give him a chance to speak to him in private even after the ceremony!

This one was a superstar in the gentlemans game and won acclaim as a great willow wielder. Once he had occasion to lead the national team. Recently, he had to attend courts for failing to pay maintenance to his ex-wife and children.

However, our hero had told court that the income he was getting was hardly sufficient to pay the maintenance. Following this plea by the willow wielder the court had called for the records of payments made to him by the institution running the gentlemans game and the records had showed that his annual income had topped the Rs.100 million mark!
Rs.20,000 monthly maintenance is chickenfeed for him, a senior willow wielder quipped.

No cookie-cutter model for reconciliation: German FM
	
There is no cookie-cutter model that can be applied to achieve reconciliation and the efforts should instead be focused on a holistic approach that incorporates several elements, German Foreign Affairs Minister Dr. Frank-Walter Steinmeier said this morning. 
Delivering his press statement a short while ago at the Foreign Affairs Ministry following bilateral discussions with his Sri Lankan counterpart Mangala Samaraweera, Dr. Steinmeier noted that there is no one-size-fits-all model to address issues of reconciliation and justice. He emphasized the importance of a holistic approach that incorporates elements of truth seeking, re-compensation, justice and guarantee of non-recurrence while also developing outlooks for the future of the younger generations in order to guarantee that the society does not fall back into past ways of conflict.
Meanwhile, Minister Samaraweera during his address noted that Sri Lanka is currently laying the groundwork for a new Constitution including a new electoral system based on what is popularly known domestically as the German Model, in the aim of resolving longstanding grievances of the minorities and to embark on economic reforms that would result in a social market economy.
The Minister furthermore stated that Sri Lanka hopes to prioritize closer economic cooperation with German, pointing out it is Sri Lankas fifth largest export market that accounts for nearly 5% of the exports. He also encouraged and welcomed other German firms including those from Mittelstand to benefit from Sri Lankas skilled labour-force, improving governance and easily accessible emerging markets along the Indian Ocean rim including India and Pakistan.(Lakna Paranamanna)

Sri Lanka Tourism is branding each global fair based in the platform " An Island of thousand treasures" so that we start developing a footprint globally said the Chairman Sri Lanka Tourism Promotions Bureau Dr Rohantha Athukorala.
 TTG Incontri in Italy - The cultural focus country - Sri Lanka
ATM in Dubai took the Sri Lankan Wildlife theme, ITB in Berlin took the theme Sri Lankan Beaches, KOTFA took the proposition 'Sri Lankan Festivals' and Moscow Travel Fair was themed 'Sri Lankan Tea and the Guinness Book of records attempt' which are all coming under the positioning " Sri Lanka - an island of thousand treasures" said Chairman Athukorala.
Next week Sri Lankan Tourism will theme the next wave of global trade fairs in line with the aspirations of the targeted traveller he said. Starting from JATA in Japan where the theme will be " Worlds oldest fetival- Esela Perahera", the key Scandinavian fair will take the proposition " Sri Lanka the sapphire capital of the world" whilst the famous Italian TTG fair will be taking the proposition " The cultural focus country - Sri Lanka" said the Sri Lanka Tourism Promotions Bureau in a communique .
Sri Lanka taking the Cultural Focus Country of TTG Incontri 2015, the key Italian exhibition and in the top five in Europe for the tourist trade, will be staged at Rimini Fiera Italy.
Sri Lanka, whose cultural tourism has been acclaimed by international tourist trade members and is attracting increasing market attention, has a dynamic attractive proposal for international tourism said a fair organizer from Remini. This can be seen for example by data of Master Card clients, which show Sri Lanka as the first country in which digital cash transaction have increased. The islands capital, Colombo, with an increase of 21%, beats Chengdu, the capital of the Chinese province of Sichuan and Abu Dhabi, capital of the United Arab Emirates, in third place as far as growth is concerned.
Sri Lanka registered 21,000 arrivals from Italy to Sri Lanka last year and is targeting 40,000 this year. The chairman Sri Lanka Tourism Promotions Bureau Dr Rohantha Athukorala said we are more interested in attracting the $250 plus traveller than just pushing visitor arrivals. Italy is one of the countrys seven most important incoming markets, in ranking topped by China, followed by India, France and Germany.
The number of tourists visiting the country is increasing given that as at end August 2015 the numbers record a 17.1% crossing the 1.1 million number which proves that the destinations and services offered are increasingly popular. This success is due to the countrys peace and beauty: Sri Lanka is often described as the Pearl of the Indian Ocean. The facilities offered range from immense beaches to parks, but attention is focussed above all on the countrys historical and cultural wonders said the Conference organizers it's weekly press release. 
For nature lovers, particularly fans of water sports such as windsurf, Sri Lanka is also an increasingly popular destination, as it is for those looking for great emotions, in contact with the wilder parts pf the country, which also has the worlds highest concentration of leopards. Numerous initiatives are also offered by the ministry of tourism and the possibilities of accommodation are increasingly suited to western and international tourists requirements. Not to mention the spiritual dimension and the possibility Sri Lanka offers for discovering oneself Saudi the release.
From 8th to 10th October 2015 Rimini Fiera will also host the 52nd TTG Incontri, 64thSIA GUEST major International Hospitality exhibition and 33rd SUN , the key International Exhibition for the Outdoor world.

While Prime Minister Narendra Modi was prompt in inviting Sri Lankan President-elect Maithripala Sirisena to New Delhi even before he was sworn in, the Congress-led Opposition appeared a bit circumspect.
Quite glowing in his praise, Modi, in his letter to President Sirisena, significantly wrote that it was the latters vision for Sri Lanka and his capacity to connect with peoples yearning for change that ensured his victory.
Also underlining his approach towards the Saarc neighbourhood since he was sworn in, the Prime Minister added that he hoped to take Indo-Sri Lankan relations to a new level for the benefit of the people of the region.
Having set a positive tone, the PM then softly advised the newly elected President that effective reconciliation was crucial, for him to succeed in building a peaceful and prosperous Sri Lanka. Modis invite to the new Lankan President came thereafter.
Though no less welcoming of Sirisenas victory, the Congress underlined that the election should usher in a new era for the long suffering ethnic Tamil population of the island nation.
This was after party supremo Sonia Gandhis congratulatory statement to the new Lankan President was read out. We hope that the new President would use the mandate and the votes he got from the (Lankan) Tamil population to make tangible progress on long-pending issues. We hope he will uphold the rights of the minority population of his country, Congress spokesperson Shoba Oza said. (The New Indian Express)

The Bar Association of Sri Lanka (BASL) had urged the newly elected President Maithripala Sirisena to arrange necessary measures to reinstate the 43rd Chief Justice Dr. Shirani Bandaranayake, who was impeached by Parliament in January 2013.

He told the Daily Mirror that it received a positive response from the President and Prime Minister and further stated the matter would be discussed at the BASL Executive Committee Meeting soon.
Pathirana stated that the BASL made a request to reinstate 43rd Chief Justice since she was subjected to political victimisation and lost her position through a wrongful impeachment procedure.
The BASL observed that the President of the republic has power to appoint the judges of the Supreme Court in accordance with the article 107 of the constitution.

Explosives strapped to girl kill 20 people at Nigerian market
	
Explosives strapped to a girl, who was described as young as 10 years old, detonated at a crowded marketplace in Nigeria, killing at least 20 people and injuring 18 others, according to police.
The police estimate differed with the local hospital's, which counted 51 people with blast injuries.
The suicide blast happened at the main entrance of the ever-crowded Monday Market, which is the city of Maiduguri's largest market. Around <U+200E>12:40 p.m. on Saturday, the girl was stopped for screening by vigilantes who man the gates of the market, according to witnesses and rescuers.
Among the 20 deaths included the girl, who detonated the improvised explosive device, said Gideon Jubril, Borno state's police spokesman.
Although no one has claimed responsibility, Boko Haram militants are the main suspects. 
This was the fourth suicide attack on the city's market since last July.
Abur Babakura who was at the scene said the explosives detonated as the girl, who appeared about 10 years of age, was being screened with a metal detector at the market's entrance. It's standard procedure for people to be screened before entering the market.
"The metal detector beeped indicating she was carrying a metal under her dress, but it exploded before she could be singled out from the crowd," said Babakura.
"We believe that (there) was an accomplice watching from a distance pressed the remote," he said.
Two of the vigilantes manning the entrance were among the dead, he said. Many of wounded victims taken to Maiduguri Specialist Hospital have life-threatening injuries, said Musa Kyarimi, a nurse there.
The marketplace in Maiduguri has been a frequent target. More than 45 people were killed in late November last year in a twin suicide attack and more than 10 others died in another suicide blast a week later on December 1. Another suicide bombing on July 1 left at least 15 people dead and several injured.
Boko Haram has terrorized northern Nigeria regularly since 2009, attacking police, schools, churches and civilians, and bombing government buildings. It has also kidnapped students, including more than 200 schoolgirls who were abducted in April and remain missing.
Maiduguri is the capital of Borno State. The deadly Saturday blast came after a bloody massacre in Baga, a fishing town about 125 miles away, where Boko Haram militants killed hundreds, possibly as many as 2,000 people. That massacre has been described as Boko Haram's deadliest act by Amnesty International.
The Islamist group, whose name translates to "Western education is sin" has said its aim is to impose a stricter form of Sharia law across Nigeria, which is split between a majority Muslim north and a mostly Christian south. (CNN)

Video: UNP - UPFA trying to destabilise
	
	The UNP today unveiled what it called a shocking attempt allegedly made by former President Mahinda Rajapaksa and his brother Gotabaya to deny the victory to President Maithripala Sirisena by blocking the counting of votes and thereby declaring the winner by Elections Commissioner with the assistance of Army Commander, the Inspector General of Police and the Attorney General early Friday morning.
	Media Director of the UNP and Matara District Parliamentarian Mangala Smaraweera told the media at the office of the Leader of the Opposition, that the good officials in one voice had refused to cooperate with the two and prevented a possible blood bath in the country and saved democracy.
	Mr. Samaraweera said one of the first priorities of the new cabinet would be to probe this conspiracy and bring the culprits to book.
	The people of this country and the global community should know what was going on behind the curtain after the election, he said.
	We have credible information that the Army Commander, Police Chief and Attorney General were called to the Temple Trees at 1.00 a.m. on Friday and checked with them a way to stop counting of votes immediately when the two knew that they were losing the election.
	Fortunately, the Army Commander and the IGP have told Mahinda and Gotabaya in no uncertain terms that they could not be a party to this illegal attempt and not ready to give unlawful orders to men under their command.
	Attorney General has said the illegal and unconstitutional action will have extremely dangerous repercussions. The modus operandi of the two brothers was to grab power through a military coup. The people of this country and the global community should know this, Mr. Smaraweera charged.
	Mr. Smaraweera said the government was thankful to the three top officials for their bold step and added Army Commander though was with the last government and even printed a booklet in support of former President Rajapaksa he has acted responsibly at this occasion and the government appreciated it.
	There was huge pressure on the Police and Army from the UPFA government to support its election campaign but they acted independently to the maximum level possible and IGP N.K. Illangakone had done a good job, he added.
	The best example is the canard spread on Sunday to the effect that the Army camps in the north had been stoned, which the Army spokesman had to call a press conference to dismiss it, he stressed.
	Mr. Samaraweera charged that a Police SI and a member of the Nil Balakaya had spread this fib through SMS with the assistance of a tele-drama actor, according to intelligence reports.
	Commenting on the formation of the new Cabinet and maintaining a simple majority in Parliament, Mr. Samaraweera expressed confidence that the government would be able to garner support from members of the UPFA but added if not the government did not have a choice but going for a snap parliamentary elections.
	Lets wait until January 19, the day Parliament meets in the New Year for the first time. We expect that all will go smoothly and we will be able to carry out our 100 day programme without much hassle, he said.
	He said the Cabinet would not be as big as the previous UPFA Cabinet. The Cabinet restriction is valid only for the Cabinet appointed after the Parliamentary poll.
	Mr. Samaraweera also said action could not be taken against State media but against individuals who used State media for mud-slinging and misinformation and added a mini budget would be presented in the first week of February.(Sandun A Jayasekera)WATCH

The Jathika Hela Urumaya (JHU) and several other politicians who backed President Maithripala Sirisena at the presidential election today announced setting up a special fact finding unit to gather information on large scale corruption that is alleged to have taken place in the country during past ten years.
JHU General Secretary and Member of Parliament Patali Champika Ranawaka told a media briefing that this unit had been set up to move away from a political culture, where those who face allegations of corrupt were cleared of all charges after they shift sides, whenever there was a regime change.
We will not allow those who are charged with corruption to get away this time as it had happened in the past and they will be eventually behind bars, the MP said.
He said there are reports of large scale corruption that alleged to have taken place in the sectors of road development, power and energy and also on the misuse of State property. In this context he said as much as Rs. 100 million had been spent for the recent election from the State funds.
Allegations are made against powerful persons in the previous regime and also against some powerful persons in the private sector and none of them will get away, Mr. Ranawaka said.
Therefore, he urged those who are aware of the details on large scale corruption in the State sector and others to inform the unit of all details pertaining to the same. He assured that the identities of those who provide information would be confidential.
JHU Propaganda Secretary Nishantha Sri Waranasinghe said they had already received information on corruption and also information on LTTE activists.
He revealed that the LTTE Leader Kumaran Pathmanathan had not left the country and the defence sector authorities were in touch with him.
Former UNP Member of the Western Provincial Council Shiral Laktilake announced that one could provide information on phone or by fax on 011 2884583 or mail on anticorruptionfront2@gmail.com
Responding to a question raised by the journalists on the fate of those that backed the new president who face corruption charges, former UNP Member of the Southern Provincial council Maithri Gunaratne said everyone would be dealt with. (Yohan Perera and Sanath Desmond)

UNP Matara District MP Buddika Pathirana yesterday gave a statement to the CID with regard to a statement made by him about an army contract involving several billions of rupees.
Mr. Pathirana told the media that the CID informed him that they needed to record a statement from him after he revealed a fraudulent act involving a contract to supply food to the army.
I complained that the army food contract was given out for Rs.50 billion in 2010 though it could have been carried out for Rs.16 billion. The contract for 2015 has been signed for Rs.20 billion but that I suspected it would be given out for more in 2016," he said.
He said the CID was trying to find how I got hold of the documents with regard to the fraud rather than investigating the fraud.
I am a peoples representative. I get information in various ways. I am not prepared to hand over the evidence I have collected to anyone else. But I am prepared to show it to the detectives, he said.
Mr. Pathirana said he bought some documents of the 2016 tender list for Rs.5,000 from an army officer. It is a regrettable incident. I do not want to insult the army but I am only revealing the frauds so that steps could be taken to stop these acts being repeated, he said.
He arrived at the CID around 11.30 am and his statement had been recorded for several hours.

	I was asked a few questions by a police team that arrived at my residence and I answered them. The party should take complete responsibility over the matter because I was the candidate of the party. The party will take the responsibility, he said. (Ajith Siriwardana and Indika Sri Aravinda)

	The resolution co-sponsored by UK, Macedonia and Montenegro, was due to be tabled today by 1pm in Geneva time, but experienced a setback due to prolonged negotiations over the language since objections were raised against certain paragraphs and wording included in the draft text by the Sri Lankan delegation.
	The resolution while welcoming the governments recognition an accountability process to uphold the rule of law, appreciates the proposal made by the GoSL to establish a judicial mechanism with a Special Counsel to probe into allegations human rights and international humanitarian law violations. It also affirms the importance of having independent judicial and prosecutorial institutions led by personnel known for integrity and impartiality and has further noted the importance of participation in a Sri Lankan judicial mechanism, including the Special Counsels office, of Commonwealth and other foreign judges, defence lawyers, and authorized prosecutors and investigators.
	The resolution has also welcomed the positive engagement between the GoSL and the High Commissioner for Human Rights and his office since the new government came into power.
	The text also supports the governments four-tiered accountability mechanism unveiled by Foreign Affairs Minister Mangala Samaraweera during his address at the opening event of the 30th UNHRC session.
	Furthermore it notes that the commitments made by the government, if fully and credibly implemented, would help account for serious crimes by all sides and help achieve reconciliation. 
	The resolution has also recognised the need for accountability and reconciliation process for the violations and abuses committed by the LTTE as highlighted in the recently released OISL (OHCHR Investigation on Sri Lanka) report.
	Moreover, it has called for the OHCHR to continue to monitor Sri Lankas progress in the implementation of its recommendations and other relevant processes linked to reconciliation, accountability, and human rights and calls for the High Commissioners Office to present an oral update to the UNHRC at its 32nd session as well as a comprehensive report followed by discussion on the implementation of the present resolution at its 34th session.

	A 32 year-old man, who was arrested last evening by the Criminal Investigations Department in Bemmulla, Gampaha had confessed to the rape and murder of five year old Seya Sadewmini, the Police said.
	Police spokesman SSP Priyantha Jayakody said that the suspect was arrested while hiding in a jungle in Bemmulla.
	The suspect had confessed to the rape and murder of the girl following interrogation by the Criminal Investigations Department.
	Police said that the suspect is a bachelor and lives in close vicinity to the house of the murdered child.
	The Police earlier arrested two suspects including a 17 year old schoolboy. The arrest of the school boy drew protest against the Police action as the boy had been identified. The mother of the school boy had corroborated that he was at home on the fateful day of the murder.
	The two suspects including the schoolboy arrested previously, have been remanded till the 28th of this month.
	According to police sources, the suspect, in the Seya rape-murder case had made a lengthy confession to the CID.
	In it, he had said, As I was passing by the house of the child whom I abducted, I saw a light coming from a room. The window was opened and I saw three children were sleeping in one bed and a woman in the other.
	"I have a habit of secretly watching women sleeping and bathing. I also like children. As I was looking through the window, I saw one beautiful girl asleep. I tried the front door handle to enter because I couldnt jump through the window. The door was unlocked and I entered the room discreetly.
	I carried the child out of the house through the front door as I feared she would wake up. Her mother was fast asleep and didnt wake up.
	The child remained fast asleep as I carried her out on my shoulder.
	In the confession, he had detailed, step by step, to the CID officers how he had raped and killed the little girl, a senior police officer said.
	It had been revealed that the suspect had hidden the dead body of the child near a river bank and had gone to his sisters home in Ingammaruwa.
	A brother of the suspect had seen him wearing clothes with bloodstains and the suspect had told his brother, with threats, not to reveal anything.
	Police said the suspect had spent most of his life in the wilderness; and he had fled to the Bemmulla area and stayed in the wilds as well as in a cemetery for 12 days after committing the crime.
	The 32 year-old suspect, Dunesh Priyashantha alias Kondaya had described, in detail, the sexual abuse of five-year-old girl child Seya Sadewmi in his confession to the CID. However, it will not be published here due to the manner in which the crime had been committed. The confession cannot be revealed in a civilized society.
	The mother of the suspect arrested in connection with the death of Seya, speaking to the media, said that her husband had been convicted of theft and jailed and died in prison. She had one daughter and three sons.
	She had never being to school. Her second son was taken into custody by police on charges of killing a small child. My third son "Kondaya" who was arrested now as the suspect was a school dropout. He used to wander here and there and spend most of his time in jungles.
	I am aware that this son was in the habit of lurking in places where women bathe. He was in the habit of stealing womens undergarments. Villagers come and complain to me about him. On occasions he had been beaten up by villagers. He had also stolen pots of rice from houses. People had warned him, but to no avail. He is very obstinate. He hates to brush his teeth or wash his face or bathe, instead he prefers to get into streams and catch fish and either eat them raw or cook them over an open fire and eat them.

	The Commissioner of the Human Rights, Dr. Prathiba Mahanamahewa said today that the 17-year-old schoolboy, who was arrested over the rape and killing of five-year-old Seya Sadewmi, was the victim of a grave injustice.
	He said the student could complain to the Human Rights Council and also take the matter to court.
	The rights of the 17-year-old boy have been violated by his unjustifiable arrest. Police may arrest people as long as there is sufficient evidence against them. The arrest of the student raises the doubts as to whether he was arrested after due investigation, he said.
	He said the police had said one reason for the arrest was the presence of pornographic material on his laptop. If this is so, many others should have been arrested for keeping pornographic material with them, he said.
	Dr. Mahanamahewa said that, as a country which is a signatory to the Convention on Child Rights, Sri Lanka is bound to protect reputation of children. No mental or physical harm should be done to children. The arrested student will face many obstacles on his release, he said.
	He also criticised some media reports which attempted to portray the student as a criminal and said it was time for the media to rectify their errors. The student can also complain to the press council, he said.
	Meanwhile, the Lanka Teachers' Union Secretary Joseph Stalin condemned the rape and killing of the girl and said the police treatment of the suspects in custody was unacceptable.
	As soon as the suspects were arrested, the police acted as if the suspects had already been convicted. They accused the schoolboy of using ganja and said they found pornographic material on his laptop. This is completely wrong. Any suspect is innocent until proven guilty, he said.
	He said the police had acted without responsibility and asked how the 17-year-old bot who is an A/L student could return to school or face his parents and peers. One precious life has already lost and another life is being subjected to police injustice, he said.
	Mr. Stalin said immediate action should be taken, to produce the student in court to ascertain whether he is guilty or not. If he is guilty he should be punished and if not should be released immediately. Justice delayed is justice denied, he said.
	However, Police Spokesman SSP Priyantha Jayakody said the court will take appropriate action on the two suspects who are on remand.
	They were arrested and produced in court in order to conduct medical tests on them and to obtain DNA samples. These are required to determine if they match the foreign matter found on Sadewmi during the postmortem, SSP Jayakody said.
	He said the necessary laboratory tests were being carried out and Court would would base its decision on the analytical reports. (Sanath Desmond and Lahiru Pothmulla)

We are for a domestic inquiry with local experts: Champika
	
	Megapolis and Western Province Development Minister Champika Ranawaka said today that allegations of war crimes should be investigated under the existing judicial system by local experts in a manner that would ensure the dignity of the armed forces and those found guilty punished.
	He told a news conference that there should be a national consensus on this matter and that a final decision should be taken up by parliament while assuring compromise and unity.
	An investigation should be launched on the basis that the aggressor is the LTTE. Investigations should be done by local experts. Cases should be taken up under the existing judiciary system and punish those found guilty while ensuring the dignity and reputation of the security forces," the minister said
	Mr. Ranawaka said they were completely opposed to a UNHRC-proposed hybrid court where the cases would take up according to the international judicial system beyond the local legal system.
	There are several hybrid mechanisms where cases can be taken up. One is to take the cases within the international judicial system beyond the local legal system while the second is to take up the cases under the Sri Lankan judicial system by the foreign experts and the third is to seek foreign advice. We are against any mechanism under the international judicial system, he said.
	The said whatever the mechanism, the inquiry should be carried out under the Sri Lankan constitution and the legal system.
	The minister said there would be no problem in seeking foreign expertise but their impartiality should be considered when doing so.
	Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa has done that through the appointment of foreign experts to the Maxwell Paranagama Commission," he said.
	Mr. Ranawaka said it was Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa who introduced this hybrid mechanism for the first time in Sri Lanka through the appointment of foreign experts to the Maxwell Paranagama commission.
	The minister the contents of the UN report would have no legal bearing on Sri Lanka and that such reports had been released on previous occasions as well. (Ajith Siriwardana)

	The head of the National Movement for Social Justice, Venerable Maduluwawe Sobitha Thera today urged new President Maithripala Sirisena to form a national government as soon as possible and implement the reforms which were promised by him during elections.
	The Venerable Thera told a media briefing that his movement would start lobbying for changes as the objective of the Movement for Social Justice was not merely to remove former President Mahinda Rajapaksa from office and elect Mr. Sirisena as the president, but to bring about social and political changes.
	He said the usual post election scenario of confrontational politics should be got rid of. The Thera therefore said all members of Parliament should pledge their support to the incumbent president to bring about reforms. If any member of Parliament fails to raise his hand in Parliament for reforms, that MP would be working against the interests of the country, he said.
	Further the Venerable Thera said politicians and the rest should show the sprit which they showed during the tsunami and get together for the sake of the nation.
	Also it was highlighted that those who were defeated at the election should take it up in a good sprit and should not try to seize power.
	The Venerable Thera stressed that the new cabinet should not exceed 30 members. (Yohan Perera)

FCID DIG's phone and bill should be investigated: JVP
	
Questioning the genuineness of Financial Crimes Investigations Division (FCID), the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna ( JVP) had called for a special investigation on the mobile phone belonging to the DIG who is in charge of this division.
JVP Leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake who was speaking at a seminar in Colombo on Thursday evening, said both the mobile phone and the bill should be subjected to an investigation. This he said is necessary in order to determine the extent of undue influence he is currently undergoing. Mr. Dissanayake said the DIG gets so many calls giving him instructions while he too had made many calls seeking advice of certain powerful persons on the steps he should take regarding some cases. The ultimate result of these calls received and made by the DIG is sweeping many investigations under the carpet, Mr. Dissanayake said.
Stating that there had been conflict of interests in some instances with regard to investigation on frauds, he came out with a serious allegation that the legal advisor of the special committee on investigating financial crime Tilak Marapana had offered to appear on behalf of the accused in the Avant Garde case. Is this not a conflict of interest, he therefore questioned.
Coming up with details on the 20 point demands, Mr. Dissanayake said his party had suggested that the 19th Amendment should be re-amended in order to take away the powers which Parliament has, to approve increasing of the cabinet. Also he said JVP will lobby for the quick enacting of the Bill on Ministry Subjects. This Bill he said will help resolve the current issues that had arisen on the ministry subjects."

Based on a proposal made by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, the Government will in future follow a set of guidelines and laid down criteria on the spending of government funds.
In a letter to the Cabinet on Minimizing Waste and Excesses in the Use of Government Funds, the Prime Minister had focused attention on the wasteful spending of government funds on various projects and activities by ministers, state ministers, deputy ministers, all elected people's representatives and Government officials.
He said it was extremely vital to minimize, as much as possible, their foreign trips.
When undertaking essential foreign visits, only those well acquainted with the subjects to be discussed should be included in the delegation, the Prime Minister said.
He said every effort should be made to reduce the number of security vehicles and security personnel who were assigned to dignitaries and people's representatives.
"These new restrictions in the state sector will also be applied to regional authorities, security forces, state institutions, statutory boards and state-owned companies as well,' the Prime Minister said in his letter.
Meanwhile, the Cabinet has also noted the details of of some 59,160 vehicles belonging to ministries, departments and government institutions and statutory bodies.
Several of these vehicles are reportedly still being used by ministers, deputy ministers, parliamentarians and those who had functioned in various positions under the former government.
The Cabinet decided to instruct ministerial secretaries to take necessary steps to have these vehicles returned without further delay.

LTTEs cruel Conduct on Tamil Civilians in Wanni
	
By D.B.S. Jeyaraj
UN Report Exposes
	
The long-awaited UN report on Sri Lanka compiled by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights released last week has predictably evoked much excitement and controversy. The UN investigation  report on Sri Lanka abbreviated as OISL has provided much information about the alleged activities of the Sri Lankan armed forces, the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) and State affiliated para  military outfits such as the Eelam Peoples Democratic Party (EPDP) and Tamil Makkal Viduthalaip Puligal (TMVP). As emphasized by UN officials themselves the report is fundamentally a human rights investigation report and not a criminal investigation report. The onus is on the Sri Lankan Government to follow it up by inquiring further into the allegations and findings in the UN report.
The reaction and response to the report by some hawks  on either side of the ethnic divide tend to provide a distorted perspective of the report and its findings. On the Tamil side there is a strident demand that an independent International Investigation be launched on the basis of the report. Tamil hardliners act as if the UN report has faulted the Sri Lankan State and armed forces only. The conduct by some Sinhala politicians lends credence to this belief. These politicians from the majority community describe the report as being adverse to Sri Lanka in general and the armed forces in particular.
It is being articulated widely in this regard that the war heroes who defeated a terrible terrorist movement and freed the Tamil people from its clutches are being unfairly portrayed as war criminals. The sight of LTTE and pro-LTTE elements in the Tamil Diaspora being in the forefront of agitations for an international probe strengthens the suspicion that there is indeed an international conspiracy to blame the armed forces who fought terrorism at the behest of overseas terrorists masquerading as human rights champions. Former Defence Secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa has said that the UN probe exercise is being done at the behest of the Tamil Diaspora.The attitudes and approaches of both sides unintentionally complement and reinforce each other.
A careful perusal of the 220-page UN report reveals that the UN Human Rights Commissioners office has been to a great extent been fair and even handed in compiling the report about alleged war crimes, crimes against humanity and human rights violations being perpetrated during the 2002  2009 period in general and the final phase of the war in particular. Both the Sri Lankan armed forces and the LTTE have been accused of alleged war crimes, crimes against humanity and human rights violations. The cruel treatment of Tamil civilians by the LTTE has been documented. Blame has been apportioned to both sides but not perhaps equally. It is but natural that a democratically elected government and the legitimate armed forces of a country be held accountable at a higher level of standards than a non  State actor proscribed nationally and internationally as a terrorist organization. Apart from this there are also other factors that have restricted the UN from presenting a greater volume of information on the LTTE.The Report of the OHCHR Investigation on Sri Lanka (OISL) has explained the reasons for its inability to gain more comprehensive or official details on LTTE activity thus -    As the senior leadership of the LTTE was killed by the end of the conflict, OISL could not access LTTE officials for direct information regarding the groups policies, operations or responses to alleged abuses. Investigators interviewed a number of former LTTE cadres who had been subjected to torture and other grave violations by Government security forces. During the interviews, some provided information regarding LTTE responsibility for atrocities or abuses, but most were reluctant to acknowledge or discuss any practices or policies by the organization which might not accord with international law. In addition, the lack of availability of official LTTE documents made it difficult to confirm at what level some practices had been sanctioned. Nevertheless information from a range of sources, including victims of LTTE abuses, enabled OISL to document patterns of abuses committed by the LTTE. 
Notwithstanding the above mentioned constraints, the OISL report does present a significant volume of information on a number of issues about LTTE activity. One of these pertains to the control of movement by the LTTE. The report states as follows:
OISLs findings indicate that there are reasonable grounds to believe that the LTTE had a clear high level policy of preventing civilians from leaving the Vanni, thereby unlawfully interfering with their liberty of movement. The information also shows that the policy hardened from January 2009, although the specific instructions as to how LTTE cadres should prevent anyone from leaving need to be clarified. Nevertheless, the information gathered indicates that a number of individuals, including several children were shot dead, injured or beaten by LTTE cadres as they tried to leave, in contravention of their right to life and physical integrity. These acts may amount to direct attacks on civilians not taking direct part in hostilities, in violation of international humanitarian law. If established before a court of law, and depending on the circumstances, such conduct may amount to a war crime. By compelling civilians to remain within the area of active hostilities, the LTTE also violated its obligation under international humanitarian law to take all feasible measures to protect the civilian population under its control against the effects of attacks from the security forces.Wretched of the Wanni Earth
The pathetic plight of the Tamil civilians in the LTTE-controlled regions of the Northern mainland known as the Wanni was of great concern to me during the conflict. I borrowed the description of Franz Fannon and referred to them as the wretched of the Wanni earth when writing about them. The prevention of civilian movement by the LTTE during the final phase of the war caused me great anguish then. While the war was in progress , I wrote many times appealing and demanding that the LTTE should let the Tamil civilians leave the war zone if they desired so. I was one of the few Tamil voices crying out then to let my people go.
My inaugural column for the Daily Mirror in October 2008 was about the wretched of the Wanni earth. In that I outlined the prevailing situation in the war zone and appealed to the LTTE to let the people go. Since almost all Tamil civilians in LTTE-controlled areas were internally displaced persons (IDPs), I referred to them as IDPs. The following excerpts from that article would indicate my mindset at that time 
What then is the best option available to alleviate the suffering and ensure safety of the civilians Obviously it is an end to the war! But realistically it is not possible at this point of time when both the Government and LTTE are embroiled in a make or break war.
Under such circumstances the second best option is for the beleaguered Wanni civilians to move out from the conflict-ridden areas to the relatively safer areas under Government control. For this safe passage must be guaranteed through the setting up of a viable civilian corridor. Temporary ceasefires should also be declared and honoured. The hitch (and one hell of a one at that) is the self-styled protectors and self-imposed sole representatives of the Tamil people. The LTTE will not allow the people to move out from areas under their control.
The draconian pass system will prevent people from moving out. Besides, decades of totalitarian control have conditioned the people into submission. Moreover the vast distance from Vavuniya to the areas where IDPs are concentrated is also a deterrent. Likewise there is some reluctance by the people in moving to Vavuniya. This is due to fear that they would be penalized as people with LTTE links. Also they would be kept in camps like in the cases of existing ones at Kalimoddai and Sirukkandal. While acknowledging the fact that certain segments of the Wanni population would prefer to stay put in the Wanni rather than move out to Government-controlled areas it must also be emphasized that those desiring to leave LTTE areas should be permitted to do so.
It was this writer who first wrote in another newspaper during the first week of August about the growing IDP predicament in the Wanni and urged the LTTE publicly to allow the people to leave saying Let my People Go. This column reiterates that position and appeals to the LTTE that it must grant those among the wretched of the Wanni earth who want to leave Tiger territory, an opportunity to do so.
The easiest way is for the LTTE to relax its controls and allow exit to those who want to move out to government areas. The lack of care and concern displayed by this government to those civilians living in the arena of war deserves condemnation. Likewise, the callous conduct of the LTTE towards displaced Tamil civilians in the Wanni is reprehensible too.
IDPs are entitled to the right of movement. They should be allowed to move to areas of safety if they want to do so. While the government increases the burden on civilians in the name of security the LTTE add to their woes in the name of liberation. The IDPs are caught in the middle.
The UNHCR drafted guiding principles regarding IDPs emphasize that the displaced be allowed freedom of movement. Principles 14 and 15 are particularly explicit on this aspect. The LTTE is violating the spirit and letter of UNHCR principles by restricting movement of IDPs.Let My People Go- Poignant Plea
Let my people go was the poignant plea made by Moses to the Egyptian Despot of yore. That was a demand made to an alien ruler by the representative of an oppressed people. Today the same cry Let my people go can be articulated on behalf of the Wanni IDPs to the LTTE hierarchy. Sadly, the LTTE and the Wanni civilians are all of the same ethnicity. Ironically the LTTE claims to be fighting for the Tamil cause. This then is the tragedy of the Tamils, particularly those wretched of the Wanni earth.
The long war ended in May 2009. In 2013, I was able to visit the land of my birth after an absence of 25 years. I travelled in the North and saw at first hand how a bruised and battered people were getting on with life. I was delighted to see the civilians in the Wanni moving around freely without their right of movement being restricted. I was particularly happy to see schoolchildren on the roads without fear of being conscripted. I was glad that the wretched of the Wanni earth were enjoying the sunshine of hope in their lives.
It is against this backdrop therefore that this column focuses on how the LTTE forcibly prevented the Tamil civilians from leaving the Wanni war zone virtually holding them as hostages. I think this is essential because the Tamil people at large must do some soul searching about how the so called protectors of the Tamil people oppressed and persecuted Tamil civilians in the name of Tamil liberation. I shall be relying extensively on extracts from the UN report.
In this regard, the OISL report itself observes thus -Likewise, there must be recognition within the Tamil community, for example, of the destruction and harm inflicted on civilians and communities by the LTTE. While the LTTE no longer exists nor controls territory; the legacy of the abuses, committed by and large with total impunity, remains and must be addressed. Even now, in some parts of Sri Lanka, those who were the victims of abuses by the LTTE are still afraid to talk about what happened in the presence of former LTTE cadres.Moment of Introspection for Tamils
The premier political configuration of the Sri Lankan Tamils today is the Tamil National Alliance (TNA). The TNA issued a statement welcoming the UN report. In a refreshing departure from the past, the TNA made a solemn declaration in that statement. The TNA said:  We also accept and undertake to carry out our responsibility to lead the Tamil people in reflecting on the past, and use this moment as a moment of introspection into our own communitys failures and the unspeakable crimes committed in our name, so as to create an enabling culture and atmosphere in which we could live with dignity and self-respect, as equal citizens of Sri Lanka.The UN report has revealed a lot of information about LTTE activity. I shall however confine this article to the issue of how the tigers controlled civilian movement alone. Hopefully other aspects concerning the LTTE could be delved into in greater detail in forthcoming articles. The OISL report at the outset states that Controls on movement by the LTTE date back many years before the start of the period covered by this investigation, notably by a pass system that was used to grant permission for leaving LTTE-controlled areas. The pass system was implemented with varying degrees of severity. From the beginning of 2009, however, the restrictions became more severe and the pass system was stopped other than for urgent medical cases.
The OISL report goes on to say: As the conflict intensified in 2008, the pass system became more and more restrictive to the point where passes were no longer issued except for urgent medical cases referred by a medical doctor for treatment not available in the Vanni. According to a credible source, the LTTE even exercised some control over the medical referral process. LTTE cadres were assigned the responsibility to oversee and authenticate the personal details and medical condition of individuals who were being referred by doctors for treatment outside LTTE-controlled areas. By the end of 2008, therefore, as military operations in the north began to intensify, the civilians in the Vanni were already enduring severe controls and restrictions on movement: they had no option but to stay in the LTTE-controlled territories, whether they wanted to or not.Introduction of Coercive Measures by LTTE
The OISL report has a section titled Introduction of coercive measures to restrict movement  2009. This section discloses detailed information about how and why the LTTE intensified its control over civilian movement and forcibly restrained people from leaving. I am reproducing many paragraphs from that section in order to provide a narrative about what went on in those dark - dismal - days. Here are the excerpts:
By early 2009, measures to prevent people from leaving became increasingly coercive as the LTTE was gradually losing ground, the conflict intensified and people were becoming more desperate to leave with the SLA advancing. It emerged clearly from numerous statements received by OISL that in early 2009, most likely January, there was a decision by the LTTE leadership to prevent all civilians from leaving if they tried. The LTTE Military Wing was instructed to implement the policy. Some sources said that the instructions to military cadres were to shoot at the ground if those fleeing refused to turn back, and to seek instructions from commanders if they still refused to retreat. 
OISL received conflicting information as to whether the senior leadership had given instructions to shoot directly at those who tried to leave. At least one source said they heard a senior leader giving orders to military cadres to shoot people if they tried to leave. On the other hand, one source alleged that when such a shooting incident occurred those responsible were punished by LTTE leaders, though OISL could not confirm this. OISL can therefore not confirm whether the killings reported below were part of an official policy, or the actions of individual cadres. 
Witnesses stated that the LTTE told the civilians that they could not leave because the international community would intervene to protect them. Several sources suggested that the reason why the civilians were not allowed to leave was also because some of the LTTE leaders believed that high civilian casualties as the SLA advanced would provoke the intervention of the international community. Available information suggests that the LTTE put in place physical measures to prevent people from leaving its controlled areas, including the creation of checkpoints and sentry positions. These positions together with LTTE mobile patrolling units were seen stopping civilians attempting to cross into Government-controlled areas.
Witnesses described how LTTE cadres blocked their path as they tried to leave the conflict area, forcing them to retreat. There were allegations that some were threatened and subjected to intimidation. In some instances people were beaten, following which some were forcibly recruited by the LTTE to participate in military work such as to build trenches along LTTEs front line positions. Fear of reprisals was often sufficient to deter many from leaving.LTTE Sentry Points by the Water
A number of sources told OISL that they had heard of people being shot, or shots being fired, when civilians tried to leave. OISL received information from other sources about a number of specific incidents, including allegations of several incidents in which civilians were reported to have been killed. One witness described how in the middle of the night, on an unspecified date, they and about 40 or 50 others tried to get to a ship which was bringing in humanitarian supplies, but that the LTTE had set up sentry points by the water and threatened to shoot them if they tried to get past. They tried another route but were again stopped by the LTTE, whom they identified as new recruits because of their uniforms, and because they looked like teenagers. According to the account, when one of the groups started shouting at the cadres to let them go, one of the cadres fatally shot him in the chest. The group were reportedly later blocked by a small group of teenagers armed with rifles who were visibly distressed at their task. Eventually they let the group move forward. 
In another incident on February 4 at Udayaarkaadu, hundreds of civilians, including children, were stopped by a group of armed LTTE military cadres as they tried to cross a paddy field towards the Government side.  The civilians were told to retreat but they kept moving. The cadres reportedly fired warning shots in the air and then on the ground causing bullets to bounce up towards the crowd. Several persons were reportedly injured on the legs from the ricocheting bullets and one person was killed as a result.  Bullet injuries to the lower legs were also described in another case, which reportedly occurred in April when two men were shot as they tried to leave. It is not clear whether the injuries were due to direct shots or ricocheting bullets. 
Other shooting incidents, reported in March, include the shooting and injuring of a 12-year-old girl. She was with her young sister and parents as they moved towards the lagoon to leave. LTTE cadres arrived and shot at them, injuring the girl in the thigh and causing the family to fall into the water. They were brought back to the shore by the LTTE and the girl was taken for treatment.  One of the cadres told the witness that they had orders to shoot at people if they tried to leave.Elilan Head of LTTE Recruitment Wing
In another incident, on or around March 20, thousands gathered on the beach after at least one very young child was killed, reportedly when the LTTE fired shots to prevent the crowd from leaving the previous night. Some reports indicate that others were also killed as they tried to flee. The protesting crowd pleaded to be taken on an ICRC ship that had arrived to deliver humanitarian assistance and evacuate seriously ill patients. Witnesses said that people were shocked and disillusioned after these incidents because they never expected the LTTE to treat the people in that way. The crowd was eventually dispersed by several hundred LTTE cadres. Senior LTTE leader Elilan who was the then head of the LTTEs recruitment wing, was among those reportedly involved in the incident at the beach. 
In another reported incident in March, almost a thousand people tried to escape across the lagoon. The LTTE had set up sentry points near the water; however some of those who tried to escape were beaten with sticks and PVC pipes. Men were reportedly taken away to build bunkers. Several young people, including children aged approximately 14 years old were reportedly forcibly recruited causing distress to them and their families. 
Witnesses described another incident on April 22, after intense SLA shelling, including immediately around Puthumathalan Hospital, when thousands of civilians attempted to leave the LTTE-controlled area. According to witnesses testimony, the LTTE threatened them and fired shots into the air to scare them, in an attempt to force the crowd to retreat. Later that same night, they managed to escape from the LTTE-controlled area in spite of the continued shelling and shooting, reportedly coming this time from the SLA positions. According to witnesses testimony, people were very desperate to flee the fighting and began walking towards the Nandi Kaddal lagoon, some carrying their friends or relatives who were unable to walk due to injuries or exhaustion. The LTTE did not attempt to stop them this time, and some cadres even helped them. Unconfirmed reports suggest that some of those trying to cross may have been killed by the SLA shooting, because at the time there was no counter fire from behind where the LTTE military was located. 
In other cases, individuals were reportedly beaten by the LTTE, such as one man when he tried to leave with a crowd of some 200 individuals on March 18. The LTTE was ultimately not able to control the angry crowd, who were then able to leave. Another witness recounted being beaten with a stick by LTTE cadres when she tried to leave and saw others also being beaten. Witnesses said people were desperate to leave; even though they risked being shot by the SLA as they crossed over.  In one incident, around March 14, 2009, near PTK, the LTTE reportedly physically assaulted a couple and prevented them from leaving.  The man was forcibly taken by the LTTE for what she believes was military duties close to the LTTEs front-line positions, though he managed to escape a few days later.Female Suicide Bomber at Vishwamadu
On February 9, 2009, a female suicide bomber crossed over and blew herself up at an IDP registration point at Vishwamadu in the Mullaitivu District, killing a number of soldiers and at least eight civilians, including a child. The United Nations spokesperson in Sri Lanka at the time stated the UN deplores the attack that killed and endangered the lives of innocent civilians, especially those fleeing the fighting.
The Government claimed that all the civilians were held hostage or used as human shields and their goal was to liberate them. Some witnesses told OISL that they moved with the LTTE because they believed that the LTTE would successfully counter the SLA and a ceasefire would be announced, or they believed that the international community would intervene. Some said they felt a sense of moral obligation to follow the LTTE who they believed were fighting for the Tamil people.
A number of witnesses also said that they remained in the LTTE areas because they feared being caught in the crossfire whilst attempting to cross the front-line positions. Between a combination of the LTTE preventing the people from leaving the Vanni and the dangers of trying to cross over the front lines between combatants (and often mines) we were helpless and trapped, stated one witness. Others said that they felt they could not leave because they had a family member or relative with the LTTE  including those who had been forcibly recruited. Several others had relatives who were too old, sick or injured to leave, and therefore, decided to remain in the Vanni. 
Many also feared harassment or abuse by the SLA if they crossed to the other side. Several witnesses cited fear of sexual harassment and abuse, of being falsely accused or being perceived as LTTE supporters and being white vanned and disappeared by the SLA. Others expressed apprehension regarding the screening process and subsequent deprivation of their liberty that they would be subjected to in Government-managed IDP camps. The available information suggests, nevertheless, that these fears were also manipulated by the LTTE in such a way as to discourage people from leaving the Vanni. The LTTE held public meetings where they warned people of ongoing abuses by the SLA.  At a meeting in April 2009, the LTTE leaders reportedly used the fear of women being raped as a reason for justifying preventing people from leaving the Vanni.Psychological Trauma of Feeling Trapped
Witnesses described fears of punishment from the LTTE if they tried to leave and this exacerbated their constant state of panic at being forced to stay in an area that was under almost constant attack by the SLA. Witnesses told OISL that they continue to suffer from the psychological trauma of feeling trapped while exposed to artillery strikes and gunfire. Most of the cases of shootings reported to OISL were related to shots fired in the air or on the ground. In several cases, armed LTTE military cadres shot directly at civilians attempting to flee, reportedly causing fatalities. In some of these cases ricocheting bullets caused injuries (see below). Most of the incidents reported to OISL occurred in March 2009 and a few in April. 
In spite of this policy of forcing tens of thousands of civilians to remain in an area which was constantly being shelled, with high civilian casualties, and in spite of the attempts by the LTTE to prevent people leaving through threats and violent means, an increasing number tried to do so. Many testimonies indicate that in the last few weeks of the conflict, most civilians, as well as some cadres, were desperate to leave because of the intense shelling and shooting, forced recruitment, multiple displacement, lack of food, water and sanitation, and they were prepared to risk being caught in cross fire or be subjected to reprisals from the LTTE. 
People escaped by night when they would not be seen, although in doing so they risked being shot at by the SLA. Others were able to escape by negotiating with local LTTE cadres they knew. For example on February 4, a group of about 50 families who were initially denied permission to leave finally managed to obtain authorization from a local commander that some of them knew. In spite of shooting from both parties, they crossed the lagoon carrying white flags on a stick.  About 100,000 fled when the Government forces broke through the LTTE defence lines on April 20.LTTE Leader Prabhakaran Gave Orders
On May 14, according to reports, LTTE leader Prabhakaran gave orders which were made public that the population were free to leave and would not be stopped by the LTTE. Tens of thousands then crossed over into Government-controlled territory.
This then is the tragic tale of how the LTTE prevented the beleaguered Tamil civilians from seeking safety by leaving areas under Tiger-control. The UN report has provided much detailed information. It is the duty of the Sri Lankan Govt, the TNA and human rights organizations to ensure that allegations of LTTE atrocities also be investigated fairly. The UN and the so-called international community must see that allegations against the LTTE are examined in detail by whatever mechanism is set up by the Sri Lankan Govt. Failure to do so would reinforce the suspicion that the UN investigation was only aimed at targeting Sri Lankan armed forces and not the LTTE. The Tamil people must face up to the fact that the LTTE conducted itself cruelly in the name of Tamil liberation. It remains to be seen as to whether affected Tamils would come forward and publicly testify at tribunals and truth seeking commissions about the suffering they underwent at the hands of the self-styled sole representatives.D.B.S.Jeyaraj can be reached at dbsjeyaraj@yahoo.com

New US resolution a path breaking success: Mangala
	
Foreign Affairs Minister Mangala Samaraweera yesterday said the fresh resolution on Sri Lanka sponsored by the US, which was tabled on Thursday, is a path breaking success achieved at the 30th session of the UNHRC.
In a media statement on the fresh UNHRC resolution on SL, Minister Samaraweera who is currently in New York attending the UN General Assembly, said it was a complete shift from the way in which Sri Lanka was perceived among the members of the international community.
He however said that presently, owing to the efforts of the new government led by President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe since the beginning of the year, Sri Lanka had once again managed to shed its negative image and emerge as a responsible, confident and peaceful nation that respected universal values of freedom, equality and justice.
The Minister said the victory that Sri Lanka managed to achieve through the tabling of the new resolution, which Sri Lanka too had co-sponsored, was in line with the 100-day programme that reflected the desire of Sri Lankans to hold a credible investigation into alleged violations of human rights and guarantee non-recurrence.
He also said the international community had now recognised the professionalism and discipline of the Sri Lankan armed forces and added that this resolution was an endorsement by the international community of this view.
Minister Samaraweera said that a credible accountability process would safeguard the reputation and honour of those in the military who conducted themselves with professionalism and an appropriate manner during the conflict period.
The invitation extended to the Sri Lanka security forces by the UN Peacekeeping Department to increase participation in the global UN peacekeeping and the invitation extended to President Sirisena to participate in the Summit on Peace Operations co-chaired by the US President in New York on September 28 are clear examples of this fact, the statement said.
Furthermore, the Minister said that Sri Lanka was confident of its capacity, expertise and commitment to implement the provisions of the resolution systematically and thereby assume its rightful place among the community of nations.(Lakna Paranamanna)

Gunawardena added further that even third-party VIP customers will benefit, with a cover of Rs.200,000 for hospitalisation, in the event of a road traffic accident within Sri Lanka for vehicles and Rs.100,000 for motorcycles.
Asked to explain the roll out plan for the new benefits, Gunawardena indicated that the new cover will be valid for new policies, explaining that existing policyholders will get to enjoy the new benefits with their next renewal, but added that in the case of individual customers, the insured will be entitled to this revolutionary benefit, while corporate customers or fleet owners must name an individual (user or driver) as beneficiary.
Ceylinco General Insurance has always had the best interest of the customer at heart, as it is our loyal clientele who have made us who we are. Being the undisputed market leader in the Sri Lankan insurance arena and maintaining that position uninterrupted for almost a decade stands testament to how millions of Sri Lankans feel about us and it is incumbent on us to ensure that their needs are anticipated and met and that they have the best service at all times, Gunawardena said, explaining the ethos behind the credo of continuous innovation, adopted by Ceylinco General Insurance.
He went on to say that Ceylinco General Insurance does not believe in discounts or undercutting the insurance market, as that would prove fatal to the whole industry in the long term and instead, endorsed the idea of providing more and more benefits and innovations that will benefit both the customer and the industry.
Ceylinco General Insurance revolutionised the motor insurance sphere in 2003, when it introduced the On The Spot claim settlement methodology, which was subsequently hailed by the Asian Insurance fraternity, winning Ceylinco The Innovation Of The Year accolade, at the Asia Insurance Awards.

Sri Lanka co-sponsors fresh US resolution
	
In a significant shift from the position it adopted in the past at the UNHRC over its human rights record, Sri Lanka announced its co-sponsorship of the new US-sponsored resolution titled Promoting Reconciliation, Accountability and Human Rrights in Sri Lanka.
The resolution A/HRC/30/L.2 was tabled at the UNHRC several hours behind the scheduled time, following lengthy negotiations between the Sri Lankan delegation and the Core Group sponsors -- which includes delegations from US, Britain, Montenegro and Macedonia  to reach a consensus on the language of the draft resolution over which objections were raised by the SL delegation including Ambassador Ravinatha Aryasinghe, Sri Lankas Permanent Representative to the UN in Geneva.
The tabled resolution contains several amendments when compared with its initial draft but remains firm in its call for an international role in the domestic mechanism that would be set up to address accountability issues.
The document that contains 20 Operative paragraphs and 23 preambular paragraphs, has affirmed the need to create independent judicial and prosecutorial institutions and has noted the importance of participation in a Sri Lankan judicial mechanism, including the Special Counsels office, of the Commonwealth and other foreign judges, defence lawyers, and authorized prosecutors and investigators.
It has recognized and welcomed the four-tiered accountability mechanism unveiled by Foreign Affairs Minister Mangala Samaraweera on the opening day of ongoing 30th UNHRC session, which seeks to address victim grievances focused on four aspects including truth-seeking, justice, reparations and guarantees of non-recurrence.
The resolution notes that a credible accountability process will preserve the good reputation and credibility of those within the military who have conducted themselves with honour and professionalism and adds that if the proposed mechanisms are implemented effectively, they would help account for serious crimes by all sides and help achieve reconciliation.
It has also recognised the need for accountability and reconciliation process for the violations and abuses committed by the LTTE as highlighted in the recently released OISL (OHCHR Investigation on Sri Lanka) report.
The resolution text also notes the importance for the government to expedite the issuance of Certificates of Absence to the families of the missing as a temporary measure of relief, accelerate the land returns to its rightful civilian owners and to implement further efforts to end military involvement in civilian activities. Moreover, it has encouraged the government to introduce effective security sector reforms as part of its transitional justice process.
Meanwhile, the resolution also called upon the OHCHR to continue to monitor Sri Lankas progress in implementing the recommendations it has made and other relevant processes linked to reconciliation, accountability, and human rights and has called for the High Commissioners Office to present an oral update to the UNHRC at its 32nd session in 2016 as well as a comprehensive report followed by discussion on the implementation of the present resolution at its 34th session scheduled for 2017.
Informal consultations on the US-sponsored draft resolution on Sri Lanka began on Monday. During the meeting, Ambassador Aryasinghe raised objection at the language used in the draft, describing it as repetitive, judgmental and prescriptive. He also noted that certain terminologies included in the draft is intrusive and pointing out that its unhelpful in adopting a collaborative approach to reaching a consensus.
The negotiation process momentarily seemed to take up the same tune it adopted during the Rajapaksa regime, when it requested the draft resolution contents to be stripped to bare minimums including the deletion of 14 out of the total 26 operative paragraphs and the omission of paragraph four that calls for the proposed transitional justice process to include independent judicial and prosecutorial institutions led by individuals known for integrity and impartiality and to involve international investigators, prosecutors and judges in Sri Lankas justice processes . However, the U.S. representative to the United Nations Human Rights Council in Geneva, Keith Harper remained resolute on reaching a win-win situation as he told media that everything possible will be done to ensure a consensus is reached.
The US intention to sponsor a fresh resolution backing a domestic probe in Sri Lanka to address issues of accountability was first announced when US Assistant Secretary of State for Central and South Asian Affairs Nisha Biswal visited Sri Lanka. (Lakna Paranamanna)

Sri Lanka now free of int'l pressure: Ranil
	
Sri Lanka reached an important milestone in international relations this week after a United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) draft resolution favourable to Sri Lanka was finalised, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said.
Our representative in Geneva, along with the US representative and delegates from other countries agreed to co-sponsor the draft resolution. We are no longer in a cage, and we no longer have to face the pressures, as the world has accepted the fact that we are building a democratic society, he said.
The Prime Minister expressed these views at the CIMA 50th Anniversary Dinner celebrations on Thursday, just one hour after the resolution was co-sponsored.
He said a special Judicial Commission named Office of the Special Counsel subject to local laws and regulations would be set up to investigate allegations of human rights violations and promote reconciliation and accountability.
The Prime Minister said foreign expertise would be sought in specific areas.
We will certainly obtain help not only from Sri Lankans but Commonwealth and foreign judges and lawyers. But it will have to be carried out under the Sri Lankan Constitution, he added.
The final draft appears to have ended America's dilly-dallying as done in the past. It had earlier called for an international investigation and after the regime change in January backed a domestic inquiry prior to reverting to a domestic mechanism with significant foreign intervention.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister said the world community had been informed of the governments decision to carry out constitutional reforms.
We have agreed on implementing a political solution and bringing in the necessary constitutional reforms. As such of the biggest issues facing our country in the past five to six years has been removed and we can face the future with confidence, he said.
In a lighter vein, the Prime Minister threw a jab at Britain.
One of those responsible is sitting here, the British High Commissioner, he said and added that President Maithripala Sirisena had sent a message from New York to offset any fears about economic and political sanctions.
His message from New York was to move ahead with economic efforts without fear and develop our businesses and create the one million jobs as promised, the Prime Minister said. (Chandeepa Wettasinghe)

	When we tried to contact the managing director of the Asian Aviation Centre regarding reports that the aircraft belonged to them, Ms. Nihara Jayathilaka answered and said the aircraft was in a dilapidated condition and had been gifted to Yoshitha Rajapaksa on a written document following his request.
	The following is a transcript of the conversation with Ms. Jayathilaka:Q. Is the report true that the light aircraft which was found at the Narahenpita Economic Centre belonged to youA. Yes. It was an old, dilapidated one which is unusable. We used it for several years after it was assembled. Later on it was used only for exhibitions.Q. Did you sell it or was it a giftA. It does not have any financial value. It is just an attraction. One day Yoshitha came and asked my husband, Uncle, can I have it and we gave it to him. It is an unusable one.Q. How did the people at the Economic Centre come to know that it belonged to youA. We gave it with a letter. So it must have been there. Two days ago someone from the Economic Centre phoned me and asked whether I could help dismantle it and I sent some of our technicians and that is how it came to public knowledge. There is nothing to panic about.
	Narahenpita Police had received information that certain people were trying to take away a two-seater aircraft which was at the Narahenpita Economic Centre and found a dilapidated aircraft at the location last evening.

	The Mini-Budget of the new Governments 100-day programme will be presented in Parliament on January 29 with a relief package for the people as promised in the run-up to the presidential election, Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake said today.
	He said while increasing the salaries of public servants, a mechanism would be introduced to increase the salaries of private sector employees who make up 83 per cent of the work force.
	After assuming duties at his office at the Government Treasury complex yesterday, the minister said the mini budget would also contain proposals to reduce prices on 10 essential commodities including fuel.
	The people gave a mandate to this government to bring about a palpable change in the system of governance and for a stable economic which was drifting aimlessly. The people demanded that their tax burden be reduced because state revenue was being used for unproductive purposes. On the instructions of President Maithripala Sirisena and of Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe I have been tasked to put an end to corruption and mismanagement at the Treasury with the assistance of Treasury Secretary Dr. R.H.S. Samaratunga and other Treasury officials, the minister said.
	He said this government was under a capable and professional leadership and was not a one-man show. We are committed to eliminating the feudal system which had existed up to now. 
	The minister said the Maithripala administration was not looking at minimising corruption but at eliminating it fully.
	Therefore, acts such bribery, obtaining huge commissions between 20% and 50% and other forms of corruption will not be tolerated under any circumstance. Corrupt officials will be severely dealt with irrespective of their political affiliation and status. Officials need not be subservient to anyone under this administration, he said.
	The new government of President Miathripala Sirisena has vowed to be transparent and subjected to checks and balances.
	We criticised the Rajapaksa regime while in the opposition and now it is our turn to practice what we preached, the minister said. The economy has collapsed. We have decided to carry out an audit inquiry to know the real financial situation of the country. I hope we will be able to know in a week. Investors have stopped coming to Sri Lanka and the immediate priority is to build confidence and motivate them to invest in Sri Lanka. What we must do is not to destroy but create, the minister said. The Maithripala Government is made up of all communities and under its administration there will be no discrimination against Sinhalese, Tamils, Muslims, Burghers or Malays. Decisions on all matters will be taken collectively and not by one or two people. We are on a journey to become the most vibrant and booming economy in South Asia. (Sandun A Jayasekera)

	Pivithuru Hela Urumaya (PHU) General Secretary Udaya Gammanpila yesterday said that Maithripala Sirisena has been elected as the president of Sri Lanka for the misfortune of the people of the country.
	I predicted this long before at a press briefing. I decided to defect from the Jathika Hela Urumaya (JHU) because I didnt want to take part in any separatist agenda. Even the General Secretary of the MDMK in Tamil Nadu, Vaiko had celebrated the defeat of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa. Vaiko said the poll day was the happiest day of his life, Mr. Gammanpila said.
	He said that it was the first time in history that someone has been elected as the President of the country without a majority of votes from the main ethnic group.
	All the other elected presidents had gained the majority votes from the main ethnic group. We dont see the election results as a down fall of the United Peoples Freedom Alliance or as a defeat, he said.
	Commenting on the newly formed government, Mr. Gammanpila said it has opted to go for a hundred-day programme and then to go for a general election on April 23 after dissolving the Parliament.
	We have decided to give our maximum support to implement the hundred-day programme and after the programme, we will demand for a parliamentary election. We have only 97 more days to wait. We assure that we will form a patriotic government soon, he said. 
	However, he said the country would face a massive economic crisis if the new government went ahead with the hundred-day programme.
	He said though the former President has not given the approval, the UPFA was on the stance of fielding Mr. Rajapaksa against Mr. Ranil Wickremesinghe for the Prime Minister post at the general election.
	Mahinda and Ranils face to face combat will come on stage in April once again, Mr. Gammanpila said.
	Meanwhile Mr.Gammanpila said he and his wife Dinesha Gammanpila have in a complaint to the Borella Police said they had received death threats over the phone and that even their children would be harmed unless they left the country after abandoning the PHU Party.
	I and my wife received death threats on our mobile phone numbers 0714437681, 0717172896 and 0724698967 and as such we complained to Borella police. The complaint number is CIB (1) 251/136. Rumours were being spread through the social media before the presidential election that we had already sent our family members abroad and were planning to leave the country on January 8, Mr. Gammanpila said.
	He said it was clearly evident that we would be not in a position to take an active part in the political arena in this country.
	I hope President Sirisena who was elected to office on the promise of good governance and a compassionate era would take appropriate steps against the politicians who are behind those who are making these threats, he said. (Chaturanga Pradeep)

The Pope has a busy first day, including meetings with the country's bishops and representatives of the country's major religious groups.
He is expected to call for greater dialogue among the country's Buddhist, Hindu, Muslim and Catholics amid a surge in anti-Muslim violence by fundamentalist Buddhists.
On Wednesday, Francis will canonise Sri Lanka's first saint, the Reverend Giuseppe Vaz, a 17th century missionary credited with having revived the Catholic faith among both Sinhalese and Tamils amid persecution by Dutch colonial rulers, who were Calvinists.
Later in the day he will fly to Madhu Church, to pray at a shrine beloved by both Sinhalese and Tamil faithful.

Sajin Vass produces licence for the elephant
	
UPFA MP Sajin de Vass Gunawardena had produced a licence for the elephant to prove the legality of the elephant that was in his custody, Hikkaduwa Park Warden Asanga Gunawardene, who carried out the inspection told the media.
He said wildlife officials would carry out further investigations to ascertain the authenticity of the licence.
A team of officials of the Wildlife Conservation Department had yesterday raided the residence of UPFA MP Sajin de Vass Gunawardena at Ambalangoda in search of an elephant.
Meanwhile, some of the people who were guarding the gate and the police prevented the media from covering the incident. They questioned the police why the media should be obstructed if the parliamentarian was not involved in an illegal act. They pointed out that the elephant was being cared for by a private veterinary surgeon.
Meanwhile Balapitiya UNP Chief Organiser and Attorney Kamal Jayantha De Soysa and Pradeshiya Sabha Member Ushantha Mendis requested for permission to enter the premises to watch the officials carrying out the inspection, but to no avail.
He told the media that the UPFA parliamentarian had only owned a motorcycle had in a very short time amassed wealth to become a billionaire and that it would be investigated within a couple of weeks. He said the parliamentarian concerned was facing serious allegations.(Hemantha de Silva)

Lankans must accept to learn to live as one family: Pope
	
Pope Francis who arrived in the country this morning said that he hoped every word and action of Sri Lankan political and religious leaders will make a lasting contribution to the material and spiritual progress of all the Sri Lankans.
Speaking at the Bandaranaike International Airport upon his arrival, the Pope said that promoting human dignity and respect for human rights was also essential as well as improving infrastructures and material needs. 
The great work of rebuilding must embrace improving infrastructures and meeting material needs, but also, and even more importantly, promoting human dignity, respect for human rights, and the full inclusion of each member of society, he said. 
He said thatthe diversity was no longer seen as a threat, but as a source of enrichment and therefore people of Sri Lanka must be prepared to accept one another, to respect legitimate diversities, and learn to live as one family. 
Whenever people listen to one another humbly and openly, their shared values and aspirations become all the more apparent, he said.
Commenting on the civil war and its aftermath, the Pope saidhe was convinced that the followers of the various religious traditions have an essential role to play in the process of reconciliation and rebuilding which is taking place in the island.Speech of His Holiness Pope Francis
	Mr. President,
	Honourable Government Authorities,
	Your Eminence, Your Excellencies,
	Dear Friends,
	I thank you for your warm welcome. I have looked forward to this visit to Sri Lanka and these days which we will spend together. Sri Lanka is known as the Pearl of the Indian Ocean for its natural beauty. Even more importantly, this island is known for the warmth of its people and the rich diversity of their cultural and religious traditions.
	Mr. President, I extend to you my best wishes for your new responsibilities. I greet the distinguished members of the government and civil authorities who honour us by their presence. I am especially grateful for the presence of the eminent religious leaders who play so important a role in the life of this country. And of course, I would like to express my appreciation to the faithful, the members of the choir, and the many people who helped make this visit possible. I thank you all, from the heart, for your kindness and hospitality.
	My visit to Sri Lanka is primarily pastoral. As the universal pastor of the Catholic Church, I have come to meet, encourage and pray with the Catholic people of this island. A highlight of this visit will be the canonization of Blessed Joseph Vaz, whose example of Christian charity and respect for all people, regardless of ethnicity or religion, continues to inspire and teach us today. But my visit is also meant to express the Churchs love and concern for all Sri Lankans, and to confirm the desire of the Catholic community to be an active participant in the life of this society.
	It is a continuing tragedy in our world that so many communities are at war with themselves. The inability to reconcile differences and disagreements, whether old or new, has given rise to ethnic and religious tensions, frequently accompanied by outbreaks of violence. Sri Lanka for many years knew the horrors of civil strife, and is now seeking to consolidate peace and to heal the scars of those years. It is no easy task to overcome the bitter legacy of injustices, hostility and mistrust left by the conflict. It can only be done by overcoming evil with good (cf. Rom 12:21) and by cultivating those virtues which foster reconciliation, solidarity and peace. The process of healing also needs to include the pursuit of truth, not for the sake of opening old wounds, but rather as a necessary means of promoting justice, healing and unity.
	Dear friends, I am convinced that the followers of the various religious traditions have an essential role to play in the delicate process of reconciliation and rebuilding which is taking place in this country. For that process to succeed all members of society must work together; all must have a voice. All must be free to express their concerns, their needs, their aspirations and their fears. Most importantly, they must be prepared to accept one another, to respect legitimate diversities, and learn to live as one family. Whenever people listen to one another humbly and openly, their shared values and aspirations become all the more apparent. Diversity is no longer seen as a threat, but as a source of enrichment. The path to justice, reconciliation and social harmony becomes all the more clearly seen.
	In this sense, the great work of rebuilding must embrace improving infrastructures and meeting material needs, but also, and even more importantly, promoting human dignity, respect for human rights, and the full inclusion of each member of society. It is my hope that Sri Lankas political, religious and cultural leaders, by measuring their every word and action by the good and the healing it will bring, will make a lasting contribution to the material and spiritual progress of the Sri Lankan people.
	Mr President, dear friends, I thank you once again for your welcome. May these days we spend together be days of friendship, dialogue and solidarity. I invoke an abundance of Gods blessings upon Sri Lanka, the Pearl of the Indian Ocean, and I pray that its beauty may shine forth in the prosperity and peace of all its people.

SL co-sponsoring US resolution tragic: GL
	
Former Minister G.L. Peiris said yesterday it was tragic that Sri Lanka had co-sponsored the resolution tabled by the US at the UNHRC which termed that the security forces had committed war crimes during the war.
Prof. Peiris rejected claims by some people that the government had been able to mitigate the allegations in the UNHRC report after the January and August elections and other claims that the report would have been worse if former President Mahinda Rajapaksa was in office.
He claimed the report had clearly stated that the security forces had committed illegal killings, arbitrary detentions and arrests, committed rapes and there was ample evidence to prove that army had committed massacre. How can the government say that the report is not serious when it says that it could prove about massacre which is a grave crime in international law, he said.
Prof. Peiris told a seminar organized on the impact of the UNHRC report that all these allegations had been levelled without any basis and that they had said that the witnesses would not be revealed.
We do not know about the witnesses as they are anonymous and on what basis they had given evidence. These grave allegations had been directed based on such evidence, he said.
Prof. Peiris said the US resolution which was similar to that of the UNHRC report was partial, politicized and unreasonable and that it had said that the LTTE had never used Hospitals in the North for its military purposes.
This report is totally based on political agenda. How can a report released based on an incident happened in the past be lenient with the change of governments when the incident is the same, he asked.
He said it was the responsibility of the government to safeguard the security forces.
Former ambassador and academic Dr. Dayan Jayathilaka said this was the first time where a hybrid court has been proposed on a democratic and sovereign country in the world whereas such courts had been proposed on failed countries in the past.
He said such hybrid mechanism was in place when Sri Lanka was a British colony and that what had been agreed upon today was the same as that. (Ajith Siriwardana)

Receiving a brief case filled with greenbacks from Santa Claus may have been a mere dream he cherished. He, no doubt, believed that his dream was about to come true, when a broker from the rival camp unexpectedly promised to deliver exactly the same if he switched his allegiance to the Compassionate One. It was a tall order which required him to renounce his high position and the numerous perks attached to it which he had just begun enjoying. However, the offer was so alluring he took the plunge!
However, the broker broke the promise and the Diyawanna member furious over this let-down threatened the former that he would make a U-turn if they failed to deliver what he was promised within two days.
Meanwhile, the news about the disgruntled pole-vaulter reached the palace and the courtiers are said to be calling him back to the fold with an assurance of a warm welcome.

	The intention was very clear from our side. We were there to promote and conduct eye camps on behalf of Being Human. Salman has been doing eye camps in Sri Lanka and we always wanted to go there. But we had less time so the event was not as successful as we thought it would be. Politics was not in the picture at all, Jacky said.
	I can understand the sentiments of people but I have never spoken about my political views whether it is in India or Sri Lanka. For me it was a joyous time. I was there in my own country and Salman was with me for a charity event. It was a brilliant opportunity. We were there to spread awareness. What made me more sad was that no one asked us anything before writing such stories, added the Sri Lankan beauty.

Foreign Minister Mangala Samaraweera lodged a complaint with the CID this afternoon, requesting an immediate investigation into an alleged conspiracy that was hatched at Temple Trees, which, if successful would have dealt a hammer blow to Sri Lankas democracy.
Minister Samaraweera, speaking to media outside the offices of the CID, said that he had handed over all the details of the alleged plan to the CID on the matter and he had also given a statement concerning the plan that was allegedly hatched by former President Mahinda Rajapaksa and his brother, former Defense Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa, together with several other top officials of the government, to subvert the democratic process in the country in the wee hours of January 9.
He said they had been reliably informed of a plan which had been hatched at Temple Trees to suspend the Presidential election result and implement emergency law in the country, in the early hours of January 9. 
Part of the plan had been to surround the Elections Department using military personnel from the Panagoda camp and bend the Elections Commissioner to their will and create a dangerous situation in the country, he added.
However, he said that the brave actions of the IGP, Army Commander and the Attorney General, Yuvanjan Wijeyathileka, in standing up against the plan and refusing to follow the orders, ensured that democracy in the oldest democracy in Asia was preserved. (Lakna Paranamanna)

I want to tell all my supporters that these allegations have no basis. More than being angered, I am saddened. While we never claimed to be perfect, we always had the best interest of the country and the Sri Lankan people in mind, Mr. Rajapaksa said.
This is true not only of Mahinda Rajapaksa but of us as his children as well. We were brought up to take responsibility for our actions. As such, if I have done any wrong, I am fully prepared to face the consequences. However, I am certain of my innocence with regard to the outrageous allegations that have been put forth against me, he added.The full statement issued by MP Namal Rajapaksa
Baseless Allegations
Dear supporters and friends,
As you may have already heard, certain individuals are coming after me with a vengeance, trying to implicate me in a number of alleged wrongdoings. We expected this. Those who are older than I am will remember well that this is the usual fate that members of the SLFP must suffer whenever we lose elections. It has happened in the past, and the same is happening this time also.
As a politician, coming after me is OK because I have the strength and support system to face it. But unfortunately, Im not the only one. Many of our strong supporters  ordinary citizens  from around the country have also undergone various types of harassment. Most of these individuals didnt break the law  they only supported Mahinda Rajapaksa, and they are being punished for that choice.
I appeal to the new President to take measures to safeguard our supporters around the country and to take action against those who are carrying out this harassment. I hope he will remember that these supporters of Mahinda Rajapaksa were once strong supporters of his as well, so please ensure their safety.
We welcome the new governments initiatives of good governance, but we make a strong appeal not to allow certain individuals misuse this initiative to fulfill personal vendettas under the guise of good governance.

Pope visits Mahabodhi Temple in Maradana
	
Pope Francis made a surprise visit to the Mahabodhi Temple in Maradana late this evening and viewed the sacred relics of the Buddha's disciples, Papal spokesman Fr. Federico Lombardi said today.
Fr. Lombardi said at a media briefing that the Pope had removed his shoes before entering the temple and had spent a few minutes of silence there.
He said the Holy Father had decided to visit the temple at short notice after he had been invited by the chairperson of the Mahabodhi Organisation, the Venerable Banagala Uptissa Thera when the latter met him at Bandaranaike International Airport on Tuesday.
This was the first time a pope had visited a Buddhist Temple in Sri Lanka said Fr. Cyril Gamini, the spokesman for the Roman Catholic Church in Sri Lanka.
The Pope had also met Mr. Mahinda Rajapaksa at the apostolate nuncio's residence on Bauddhaloka Mawatha.
The Pope had also made a surprise visit to the Archbishop's House to meet the bishops but they had not yet retuned from Madhu and he had had to visit the Archbishops House again later. This time the bishops were praying when he got there and he had joined them in prayer. (Yohan Perera)Picture courtesy REUTERS

	A scriptwriter was fine tuning a film script that had to be ready within a day or two. He had been working on it for quite some time. Since the shoot had been scheduled in three days, he was making last minute changes in consultation with the author of the story.
Most of the corrections were being done through SMS. The author, who lived far away, makes a suggestion about some dialogues of a character and the scriptwriter responds. Then he suggests another change. This had been going for some days especially in the nights which annoyed the scriptwriters wife.
There should be some meaning to this. He sends you text messages. You respond and make the amendments and then he sends another message, you reply. There is no end to this. Remember you worked on this script till 4 am yesterday and now its almost 2 am. Your author should also understand that you are human, she grumbled but the scriptwriter hinted that he was vulnerable.
Even I feel so tired and sleepy but what can I do when the author wants the script and dialogues to be perfect 
Ok then listen, when he texts you next time, you reply and just say GOOD NIGHT at the end. That will make him realise its time to call it a day, she suggested.

Sri Lanka today said that as a gesture of goodwill and with the advent of the Thai Pongal festival, the new Government of President Maithripala Sirisena is processing the release on humanitarian grounds the remaining fifteen Indian fishermen from Puducherry who are detained in Sri Lanka for poaching.
The release at this juncture of the fishermen reflects yet again the desire of the two countries to address matters relating to detained fishermen in an expeditious manner. This demonstrates the goodwill and understanding which exists bilaterally and is a manifestation of the warm and abiding relationship, the foreign affairs ministry said in a statement.
It also said that there are also 87 boats of Indian fishermen which have been detained in instances over a period of time, and are presently in Sri Lankan judicial custody. Their release would be favourably considered upon claims being registered by the respective owners in the relevant Courts, in keeping with the legally stipulated practice. 
It may be recalled that earlier, the Government of India released ten Sri Lankan fishermen in Indian custody. With the on-going process for release by the Sri Lankan authorities of the Indian fishermen, both countries would have reciprocated on the fishermen in each others custody, the statement added.

	While claiming that former President Mahinda Rajapaksa should be taken to Hague for alleged war crimes, Maya Arulpragasam, the Sri Lankan Tamil recording artist said that Sri Lanka's new government has the same face as it includes politicians who have been involved in government for the last 30 years.
	She said the Tamil community had embraced democracy and peace - the Tamil vote was largely responsible for Sirisena's election - and that now the government had to restore "basic needs" to the community.
	She told Channel 4 News that reconciliation can only come if the Sri Lankan government undoes some of the Rajapaksa regime's actions, such as his militarisation of Tamil areas in the country's north.
	On the UN inquiry, Arulpragasam said "we still want Rajapaksa to go to the Hague", but that peace in Sri Lanka's post-war period was a priority for Tamils. In the years since the war there have been continued allegations of ongoing abuses such as "enforced disappearances" of Tamils and government opponents.

Artillery gun found; hotel work put on hold
	
The work on a hotel project at Galle face has been put on hold following the discovery of a ancient artillery gun at the construction site on Saturday, Archaeology Department Director General Senarath Dissanayake said today.
He said the work was suspended in keeping with the law on the Prevention of Destruction and Theft of Antiques.
Dr. Dissanayake said his Department would dispatch its analysts and experts and a team of excavators to the site today.
We will reveal the details to determine the era to which the gun may belong, he said.
Meanwhile, the hotel project workers said they believed there might be more such artifacts on the site.
A worker at the site said the two rectangular pieces projecting out of the sides of the gun suggested that the 25 feet long gun must have been fixed to a stand or a carriage, which might have been buried underground over the years.
The gun was recovered on Saturday morning. A similar discovery was made at the Central Bank Premises some years ago.
Several historical records state that during the Dutch era several artillery guns were placed in and around the Galle Face area. (Yohan Perera and Dharashana Sanjeewa)

PM upbeat on Sri Lankan solution
	
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said yesterday that the resolution co-sponsored by the US and Sri Lanka placed before the UNHRC would pave the way to bring about a Sri Lankan solution to the question of reconciliation and accountability during the last stages of the war.
At a meeting with Newspaper Editors and media organization heads at Temple Trees, he said in line with the resolution a Special Counsels office would be established and a Sri Lankan would be appointed to it. The Special Counsels office would inquire into the cases concerning allegations of human rights violations.
The Prime Minister said apart from the Special Counsels Office the other most important measure would be to establish a Truth Commission and a Compassionate Council. This he said would be done with input from South Africa through the good offices of its President Jacob Zuma. A measure that the previous regime too initiated but did not carry forward. The Compassionate Council will comprise nominees by the Most Venerable Mahanayake Theras and other religious heads in the country.
The Prime Minister said cases would be probed by the Special Counsels Office and would be referred to the Truth Commission and the Compassionate Council where necessary and on exceptional cases to the courts to be prosecuted.
He said on such occasions the cases would be heard under a Sri Lankan judicial mechanism through a court that would be established for this purpose. "If the services of Commonwealth or other judges are sought and if foreign lawyers are to appear it has to be decided by Sri Lanka's Supreme Court," the Prime Minister said and added that new laws for the establishment of a Special Counsels Office and the necessary Judicial mechanism would be introduced through Parliament.
He said with the new resolution before the UNHRC, the entire international community would stand behind Sri Lanka and back its efforts at reconciliation. The Prime Minister said most of the contents of the resolution were those proposed by Sri Lanka.
He found fault with the previous Mahinda Rajapaksa government of giving pledges to the UNHRC soon after the war ended and thereafter not following up on the very pledges given by it and thus place the country in a grave situation.
The Prime Minister said the resolution also spoke of democracy and good governance and it was an occasion to restore faith in Sri Lanka's democratic system.
When asked whether the resolution had mentioned anything about withdrawing troops out of the North and East, the Prime Minister said there was nothing like that.
He said there were discussions when drafting the resolution and there were various suggestions and added that some EU countries were of the view that Human Rights came before the sovereignty of a county, whereas India and the US maintained that Human Rights comes after Sovereignty. The Prime Minister said China and Russia had maintained that sovereignty was first and as such there should not be any foreign intervention. He said these views had been discussed and the resolution had been finalised after such discussions.
The Prime Minister said the atrocities committed by the LTTE were also highlighted and particularly about the Tamil political leadership, which was wiped out by the LTTE. He said the biggest damage done by the LTTE was to the Tamil community.
Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne and Deputy Foreign Minister Harsha De Silva also attended the meeting.

Several areas of concern in resolution- MR
	
Stating that the sponsors of the draft resolution on Sri Lanka had failed to heed the request of the Sri Lankan Ambassador in Geneva not to place primary emphasis on the alleged war crimes issue and to change their approach, former president Mahinda Rajapaksa said yesterday that there were several areas of concern in the resolution
Mr. Rajapaksa in a statement said, the first operational paragraph encourages the Government of Sri Lanka to implement the recommendations of the recently released OHCHR report on Sri Lanka. The most contentious recommendations in that report have been included as operational paragraphs in the UNHRC draft resolution as the following indicates:
"Operational Paragraph 4 welcomes the willingness of the government of Sri Lanka to allow the mechanisms set up to deal with the past, to obtain financial and material assistance from international partners. This would amount to personnel in important judicial and non-judicial bodies in Sri Lanka being paid by foreign powers.
"Paragraph 6 takes note with appreciation the governments proposal to set up a judicial mechanism to investigate violations of human rights and humanitarian law, and affirms the importance of the participation of foreign prosecutors, judges, investigators and lawyers in this process, and is contrary to the claim now being made by the government that any mechanism set up will be purely domestic."
Drawing the attention to Paragraph 8, he said it encouraged the government to remove from office military officers suspected of having violated human rights through a vetting process (even if there is no evidence to prosecute them). This in reality amounts to a purge of the armed forces, he said.

SL will strive to achieve SD goals-President
	
		 		 
		 
			
President Maithripala Sirisena said Sri Lanka will act with determination as a pioneer of eco-sensitive civilization that is emerging in the 21st century to achieve the Post-2015 Sustainable Development Agenda and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) and targets that have been adopted by the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA).
Addressing the UNGA Session on Sustainable Development in New York today (September 27), he said sustainable development encapsulates the equilibrium between social and economic development and environmental protection.
President Sirisena assured the world leaders that the Government of Sri Lanka anticipates achieving these goals fully by 2030.
Sustainable Development cannot be achieved by a single country alone. Our strategy will therefore envisage a framework for cooperation between the United Nations, regional organizations and other states.
In that respect, we will work towards the provision of basic needs of the people, progressive alleviation of poverty, elimination of all forms of discrimination and inequalities, and establish a society based on social justice and human security, the President pledged.
Full speech
Mr. Chairman,
Since its inception, the United Nations Organization has always striven to make human life more rational, more meaningful and more prosperous. As world leaders, it is our responsibility and duty to build such a world.
The Government of Sri Lanka fully supports the Post-2015 Sustainable Development Agenda and the Sustainable Development Goals and targets that have been adopted by this Assembly.
Accordingly, I declare that the Government of Sri Lanka will act with determination as a pioneer of eco-sensitive civilization that is emerging in the 21st century.
Sustainable development encapsulates the equilibrium between social and economic development and environmental protection. The Government of Sri Lanka anticipates achieving these goals fully by 2030.
In that respect, we will work towards the provision of basic needs of the people, progressive alleviation of poverty, elimination of all forms of discrimination and inequalities, and establish a society based on social justice and human security.
Parallel to this, while emphasizing on the protection of natural resources, we will also formulate a state policy on resource consumption based on the sustainable capacity of the environment.
We will strive to ensure that the relevant policy framework would be implemented within an institutional structure based on the principles of good governance espoused by my Government. Special attention will also be given to the concept of environmental good governance, as an integrated part of the good governance policies.
We will ensure the participation in these efforts, not only of the State sector, but the civil society and the business sector, as well.
Sustainable Development cannot be achieved by a single country alone. Our strategy will therefore envisage a framework for cooperation between the United Nations, regional organizations and other states.
Mr. Chairman,
Sri Lanka will be fully committed to dealing with the thirteenth Sustainable Development Goal relating to Climatic Change. We will strive to minimize risks of possible environmental hazards. I firmly believe that a proper study is required to ascertain how climate change aggravates Sri Lankas contemporary development challenges such as poverty alleviation, food security, increasing aging population and natural disasters.
Mr. Chairman,
In conclusion, I wish to affirm that in the preparation of development policies for Sri Lanka as an aspiring upper middle income country, our special attention is focused on poverty alleviation (SDG 01), achieving food security (SDG 02), energy (SDG 7), education (SDG 04), minimizing income disparity (SDG 10) and urban development (SDG 11).
Sri Lankas rich history, dating back beyond 2,500 years provides us with inspiration and strength in this endeavor. I like to conclude with an ancient Pali blessing that also adorns the preamble to the Constitution of Sri Lanka:
Devo vassatu kalena
Sassa-sampatti hetu cha
Phito bhavatu loko cha
Raja bhavatu dhammiko
May the rains fall in due season (Environmental balance)
May the harvest be bountiful (Economic Prosperity)
May the world prosper
May the Ruler be righteous(Good Governance)
This indicates that even many centuries ago, our ancestors possessed the wisdom and awareness of the Sustainable Development Triangle. As inheritors of this traditional knowledge and influenced by their ancient wisdom which will be adapted to meet the requirements of the modern era, Sri Lanka stands prepared to meet challenges successfully and march forward gloriously in the 21st century.
May the Noble Triple Gem bless you.
Thank you.

Wigneswaran lashes out at concentration of power in his party
	
Sri Lanka Northern Province Chief Minister C.V.Wigneswaran on Sunday publicly lashed out at concentration of power in the Ilankai Tamil Arasu Katchi (ITAK), the party to which he belongs.
ITAK is the single largest constituent of the Tamil National Alliance (TNA).
Striking a belligerent note in his address at the 125th anniversary function of Jaffna Hindu College, Wigneswaran vowed to stick to his convictions and urged the younger generation to do likewise. 
In certain political parties one or two persons are taking all decisions. These power centers expect others to accept the decisions they take. If others point out deficiencies in these decisions, they are branded as opposition parties, he said. 
Though Wigneswaran did not mention the ITAK, it was clear that the cap fitted it. He has been having a cold war with the ITAK leadership troika comprising R.Sampanthan, M.A.Sumanthiran and Mavai Senathirajah. While the troika views the Supreme Court judge-turned Chief Minister as their protg who should take orders from them, Wigneswaran feels that he got elected on the strength of his own credentials as a Tamil nationalist. On Sunday, he said that he was a Tamil nationalist at heart even while being a judge. 
While the troika has been veering towards cooperation with the new and liberal Maithripala Sirisena-Ranil Wickremesinghe government at the Center, Wigneswaran feels that the Tamils have not got much from the change of regime. He feels that the TNA should keep up its uncompromising line on the Tamil question.
In the run up to the August 17 parliamentary elections, Wigneswaran unilaterally issued a statement saying that he would be neutral and appealed to the Tamils to vote for genuine and un-buyable Tamil nationalists. The ITAK leadership took this as an endorsement of the radical Tamil National Peoples Front (TNPF). They charged that ITAK/TNA lost two seats because of Wigneswarans statement.
When the matter was raised at the last ITAK Executive Committee meeting, it was decided to have talks at the highest level. But clearly, the talks, if held, were fruitless. Wigneswaran continues to be belligerent and an irritant to the ITAK leadership. (New Indian Express)

The Petroleum Corporation has refused to issue fuel to a petrol station in Ambalangoda town which is said to have been owned by a well known politician of the former government due to his failure to pay a sum of Rs. 170 million due to the corporation.
Motorist say they have been terribly inconvenienced as a result of the fuel station not having fuel as only two fuel stations existed for the supply of fuel in the Ambalangoda Town. The only fuel station left for them was the one owned by the co-operative society which was now becoming crowded as a result.
A spokesman of the Petrol Station Owners Association said that the fuel was supplied by the Petroleum Corporation in Kolonnawa after the money was paid to the Corporations account. They said that the Corporation supplies the fuel according to terms and conditions of a circular.
The employees complained that the former Chairman and staff of the Corporation had supplied fuel to the errant owner of the petrol station in Ambalangoda, contravening the rules and regulations of the circular and thereby causing a huge loss to the Corporation.
It is said that nearly one million had to be paid for a bowser of petrol, because the fuel ordered by this petrol station owner from the corporation in Kolonnawa was supplied from the Regional Fuel Store in Galle adding that Rs. 750,000 had to be paid per bowser containing 6600 litres of diesel and that the profit from one bowser was only Rs. 15000 from which they had to pay salaries to the workers.
The owner of the petrol station was said to be former monitoring MP of External Affairs and former Galle District, Sajin de Vaas Gunewardena. (Janath de Silva and Chandrasiri Jasenthuliyana)

	Out of the thirty four who presented the affidavits 32 were present when they were handed over to the Governor. The Governor carefully checked whether those who presented the affidavits were present and informed that he would seek advice on this matter and reply them.
	In the meantime, Chief Minister Sarath Ekanayake told a news briefing at the Provincial Council at Pallkelle on Thursday that the Governor had no provision to remove the Chief Minister under the present laws of the Provincial Council Act.

People want money back from Gammanpila
	
	Jathika Hela Urumaya (JHU) National organiser Nishantha Sri Warnasinghe today said that Pivithuru Hela Urumaya (PHU) General Secretary Udaya Gammanpila should pay back the Rs.100 which he collected from the people.
	While protesting in front of Udaya Gammanpilas office at Tickell Road in Borella and in front of his residence in Athurugiriya, he said that now the JHU had seen how he betrayed the people and the party by going against the its policies.
	Mr. Gammanpila had requested the public to give him Rs. 100 each for his election campaign as he was unable to afford to campaign at the past Provincial Council election.
	He stood for good governance and said anyone who had faith in him could offer Rs. 100 for his campaign as he did not have any means to run for office at that time and had accordingly collected Rs.4.7 million from the people, Mr. Warnasinghe said.
	The JHU electoral organizers are now faced with a problem in handing over the money back to the people. Several people have been asking Mr. Gammanpila to return their money and questioned as to why he had left the party. Meanwhile, Gammanpila has lodged several complaints with the police saying that he and his family were getting death threats from unknown people. All the allegations being made by him are baseless, he further added.
	We have bank slips and receipts to confirm that the people deposited money in his favour. If you are genuine, please come to the electorates from the place where you are hiding, and hand over the peoples money. If you are unable to come, we can name the electorate, time and date for Mr. Gammanpila to explain his position and return the money he had collected from the people, Mr. Warnasinghe said.

Fresh look at UNHRC probe
	
In its handling of the countrys foreign policy, the new Government has decided to look afresh at the OHCHR Investigation on Sri Lanka (OISL), a deputy minister said yesterday.
Deputy Foreign Affairs Minister Ajith P. Perera told Daily Mirror that he and Minister Mangala Samaraweera discussed this matter soon after assuming duties on Tuesday. 
We have to prioritize our engagement with this investigation process. We had a discussion in this regard, Minister Perera said adding that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs would focus on the appointment of career diplomats and professionals to the Foreign Service while reducing the number of political appointments.
The investigative mechanism, for the probe on Sri Lanka, was set up in conformity with the resolutions adopted in March last year by the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC).
The resolution mandated the High Commissioner to undertake a comprehensive investigation into alleged violations and abuses of human rights and related crimes by both parties in Sri Lanka during the period covered by the Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission (LLRC) and to establish the facts and circumstances of such alleged violations and of the crimes perpetrated with a view to avoiding impunity and ensuring accountability with the assistance of relevant experts and special procedures by mandate holders.
The High Commissioner appointed three experts, Martti Ahtisaari -- former President of Finland; Silvia Cartwright -- former High Court Judge of New Zealand and Asma Jahangir -- former President of the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan, to play a supportive and advisory role, as well as an independent verification throughout the investigation.
The OHCHR had set up October 30, 2014 as the initial deadline for submissions. The High Commissioner is expected to submit this report to the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) during its session in March, this year. (Kelum Bandara)

BASL together with SLJI & CAB organizes CITS awareness seminar
	
		 		 
		 
			
The Bar Association of Sri Lanka in collaboration with the Sri Lanka Judges Institute and the Clearing Association of Bankers will be presenting a seminar to further familiarize the Cheque Imaging & Truncation System (CITS).
Members of the judiciary will be among the principle invitees at the event, which will take place on the 3rd of October 2015 at the Kingsbury Hotel, Colombo with Lanka Clear as the platinum sponsor while the Transnational Group along with BC Computers (Pvt) Ltd play the role of gold sponsors of the event.
The Cheque Imaging & Truncation System was introduced in order to expedite the clearing system in the country.
The process of the CITS is such that instead of the submission of original documents, certified images could be forwarded for legal purposes, etc.
The CITS revolutionized the clearing system in Sri Lanka, mainly due to the switch from a virtual manual system to a technologically based system. However, the system seems to have achieved mixed results where there have been quite a number of instances in which the full effect of the new banking practices under the CIT scheme has not reached many sections of the legal profession and Courts.
This results in many people engaged in litigation connected with the clearance of cheques continue to make applications to Courts calling for documents under the previous clearing system and the ultimate result is the delay in the legal process.
The primary goal of this seminar is to promote awareness of the new practices adopted by the banking industry following the introduction of the Cheque Imaging and Truncation System.
The days events will begin at 9.30 am with the welcome address delivered by Geoffrey Alagaratnam P.C., President, The Bar Association of Sri Lanka followed by the theme speech by the CEO of Lanka Clear, Sunimal Weerasooriya.
A Speech on New banking practices will be presented by Jonathan Alles, Managing Director/CEO, Hatton National Bank PLC, which will precede the keynote address by K. Kanag-Isvaran Presidents Counsel.
The panel discussion will follow with respected members of the legal fraternity such as; Justice Suresh Chandra (Retired Judge of the Supreme Court), Justice K.T. Chitrasiri (Judge of the Court of Appeal), Justice D. S. C. Lekamwasam (Retired Judge of the Court of Appeal) and moderated by Maithri Wickremesinghe President Counsel. The days proceedings will end with fellowship among invitees and organizers.

Drop in demand likely cause of power outage: CEB
	
	The Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) said today the power outage experienced countrywide on Sunday night was caused by an increase in the power supply amid a major drop in the demand.
	The demand for power had dropped because of the prevailing wet weather conditions and the long weekend.
	The CEB said the maximum peak demand during night on an ordinary working day was about 2,100 MW and declining to about 1,100 MW after midnight. During weekends, the maximum peak demand at night was around 1,900 MW with the minimum demand around 950 MW.
	However, on this Sunday due to the Poya day and the long week-end and the prevailing bad weather conditions, the CEB said the total system demand has further decreased and it was around 1,775 MW during the night peak which is a significant reduction from the usual.
	Furthermore, around 00.53, the demand was further reduced to around 940MW which is very much less than the usual 1,100MW during midnight and was dropping further. It is strongly suspected that a rare unstable situation had arisen resulting in the power outage, the CEB said.
	It said technical investigations were being done to establish the exact cause of the incident.
	The CEB System Control Centre began restoration work immediately and full power was restored by Monday morning.

	Australia, under new Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, remains committed to protecting its borders and will continue to stop anyone who attempts to come illegally by boat  regardless of where they are from.
	High Commissioner Mudie said that cooperation between Australia and Sri Lanka to counter people smuggling has never been stronger, and anyone who attempts to travel illegally by boat to Australia will be detected, intercepted and either returned safely to Sri Lanka or sent to a regional processing centre in Papua New Guinea or Nauru.
	The Prime Minister has also made it very clear that there will be no resettlement of the people on Manus and Nauru in Australia, Robyn Mudie said.
	Do not believe the lies of people smugglers, no one who travels illegally by boat will make Australia home.
	Referring to the recent Australian Government announcement that it will resettle refugees fleeing the conflict in Syria and Iraq, High Commissioner Mudie confirmed that this has no impact on Australias policy to stop people attempting to travel illegally by boat to Australia. Australia will only resettle those refugees who are registered by UNHCR and who are currently in Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey. These resettlement places will not be provided to anyone arriving in Australia illegally by boat.
	Effective action against people smuggling is in the interests of Australia and Sri Lanka, and our cooperation has saved lives by discouraging people from taking the dangerous boat journey to Australia.

PLC Fast Track business support loan for speedy success
	
		 		 
		 
			
Peoples Leasing & Finance PLC the non bank finance sector giant in Sri Lanka going from strength to strength introduced Fast Track short term loan scheme for businesses and individuals requiring urgent financial solutions. This tailor-made loan scheme is now revamped to serve PLC
customers better.
Fast Track loan scheme is designed to offer fast solutions to your day-to-day financial requirements including working capital needs. Under the Fast Track loan scheme a quick sum of money could be obtained at a minimal interest for business or individual requirements such as; expanding businesses, acquiring stocks needed for businesses, modify or adding extensions to houses, agricultural needs, to purchase lands, higher education and other business and personal
financial needs.
Movable or immovable assets could be kept as security to obtain a Fast Track loan. The maximum limit of the loan is decided upon the value of security kept and repayment capacity of the borrower. Unlike in leasing or personal loan facilities a Fast Track loan could be tailored according to the borrowers income. Further the customer could decide the loan settlement period according to his earnings. The total sum obtained could be settled with the due interest prior to the maximum loan period of two years without any surcharge.
Although the loan is given for a maximum of two year period, the borrower could request and renew the facility there onwards. The loan interest is calculated on only the outstanding capital thus a particular months payable interest becomes the due interest for that month. Lionel Fernando, DGM (Operations) PLC expressing his views on the fully fledged Fast Track loan scheme said this is a short-term loan scheme that facilitates urgent working capital needs as well as individual day-to-day needs of people.
Fast Track loan scheme was designed keeping in mind peoples urgent financial needs. The specialty here is the opportunity offered for customers to settle the loan without being pressurized or ending up with mental stress. The full loan amount could obtained at the inception itself or it could be obtained in installments according to the customers requirement and repayment capacity. Also he/she is offered with the opportunity for early settlement of loan without incurring any additional charges. Fast Track loan could be obtained speedily by producing a least set of documents. Individual, joint or corporate clients could apply under Fast Track loan scheme and the interest rate is a fixed one, said Fernando. PLC was incorporated in 1995 as a fully owned flagship subsidiary of the biggest state bank in Sri Lanka, Peoples Bank, and retained the market leader position for the past 13 consecutive years.

## Title: Strong investor confidence for Pan Asia Bank debenture issue
## Section: Financial News

Strong investor confidence for Pan Asia Bank debenture issue
	
Bank gears up for Rs.100bn asset basePan Asia Banking Corporation PLC (Pan Asia Bank) last week saw its Rs.4 billion senior debenture issue being oversubscribed on the opening day itself, receiving applications for over Rs.5.5 billion.
The issue was rated BBB by Fitch Ratings Lanka.
This is the second such debenture the bank issued in a span of 12-months. Its Rs. 3 billion subordinated debenture issue in October 2014 was also oversubscribed on the opening day itself.
Pan Asia Banks Director and Chief Executive Officer, Dimantha N. Seneviratne speaking on the success of the debenture issue attributed the oversubscription to the continuous investor confidence in the bank and its improved performance.
In a brief interview, Seneviratne spoke of the banks plans to deploy these funds to finance the growth of the balance sheet and manage funding maturity profiles. He also spoke of Banks planned Corporate Campaign coinciding with Banks 20th Anniversary and other expansion initiatives in its goal to reach Rs 100 billion balance sheet. The following are the excerpts of the interview;How do you view the recent success of Pan Asia Banks debenture issue I believe it was a strong endorsement received from the wider investment community on the banks direction and the recent performance.
In recent times we have been growing at a rapid pace  our loan book growth has been above the industry average while our key performance indicators have strengthened  and the investors have recognised the potential of our performance.
Besides, the rates that we offered were very competitive and offered a choice between the fixed and floating rates and three and four year tenors. This enabled us to attract investors with different risk appetites.
On the other hand, our debenture was the first such corporate debt issuance in two months and I am sure, it offered a solid investment opportunity for the individual investors as well as large corporate institutions to lock-in their funds. From the markets point of view too, the oversubscription of our debenture was a significant feat and re-inforced the confidence of investors. The Banks management took a bold decision to go ahead with the debenture at a time when there was uncertainty about the movement in interest rates and we are confident that we made the right decision. We will lock in these funds soon to ensure any downside risks are mitigated.
How do you plan to deploy these funds
We have a pipe-line of lending proposals in the Retail, Corporate banking and, Small and Medium Enterprise (SME) segment and these funds would be deployed to continue our growth in assets.
This will lead to a well balanced growth in our balance sheet and maintain the quality of the asset portfolio. 
As mentioned earlier, our loan book grew by over 34 percent in FY 2014 and 14 percent in the first half of 2015. So, these funds too, will be used to expand our lending portfolio while minimizing some of the maturity mismatches in our assets and liability portfolios. The funds will also be utilized to stabilize our earnings stream and improve stock of liquid assets and government securities.
Just before the debenture was issued, Pan Asia Bank received some Dollar funding too. Can you shed some light in to this
Yes, we did complete a US $ 20 million re-financing line this month with the Global Climate Partnership Fund (GCPF), one of the largest green financiers based in Europe.
This is for the lending that the Bank has been providing in the sustainable energy sector.
This clearly demonstrates that, not just the local investors but also the larger foreign financing houses too are seeing the potential of investing in Pan Asia Bank.
If you look at the institutions that back the GCPF are the World Banks private sector financing arm, The International Finance Corporation (IFC), the German Federal Governments Development Bank, KfW Bankengruppe and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Denmark.
In fact, the GCPF has expressed its willingness to extend the partnership with us and to provide much bigger refinancing facilities for green projects.Green lending in Sri Lanka is still in its infancy but this is a step in the right direction in our finance sector.  What more could your bank do to take the lead in promoting green lending in Sri Lanka
We are the pioneers in introducing green lending for the retail sector in Sri Lanka when we offered hybrid vehicle leasing and loans to finance solar panels at preferential interest rates in 2013. But now, as a matured and a bigger player, we have taken a broader perspective and are looking at funding much larger projects in the fields of renewable energy and energy efficiency. 
Currently we are looking at funding for hydro power projects and are also evaluating other renewable energy power generation projects.
Apart from the commercial value of these products, I believe this lending carries a much larger national significance, for through this lending, we help to create clean energy, clean air and a sustainable environment. This is also in line with our goals in corporate social responsibility, to contribute to climate friendly economic development. 
Further, we have ingrained the sustainability agenda in to our own business processes , loan evaluation and risk management process and have taken initiatives to reduce the Banks carbon foot print.
How did the bank perform in recent times; both financially and non-financially
During the first half of FY 2015, most of our performance indicators improved. The banks after tax profits increased by 156 percent to Rs. 451 million. This is higher than the after tax profit the bank recorded for the entire financial year of 2014 (i.e. Rs.415.2 million).
Apart from this, our biggest achievement was the doubling of our Return on Equity from 9.81 percent to 18.38 percent in a span of just six months.
We achieved this amidst the pressure on the net interest margin due to falling interest rates.
We managed to increase our efficiency by containing our cost-to-income ratio and gradually bringing it down to just below 54 percent. We have seen further improvements in this aspect.
Meanwhile, we doubled the Return on Assets from 0.58 percent to 1.11 percent during the same period.
It is also significant to mention that during this period we made substantial investment in a new core-banking system and a treasury platform to improve process efficiency and enhance the quality of delivery to provide a better service to our customers.
During the 18-months up to June 30, 2015, our balance sheet grew by 32 percent to Rs. 85.1 billion.
With the recent funding arrangements and current growth momentum, we are confident of reaching Rs.100 billion balance sheet in near future. 
In the meantime we continue to increase our footprint , last week we opened our 79thbranch in Nawala and branch expansion plans would continue.
Besides these financial achievements, we were also adjudged as the fastest growing commercial bank in Sri Lanka in 2014 by the United Kingdoms Global Banking and Financial Review.
Further, our groundbreaking lending product, Sammana  which was designed to provide access to finance to our pensioners and senior citizens  was awarded the most innovative product by a financial institution in Sri Lanka.What are your plans for the future of Pan Asia Bank
This year, Pan Asia Bank will be celebrating two decades of excellence in banking business in Sri Lanka. In order to coincide with the anniversary celebrations, we will be embarking on a brand building campaign and also reinforcing our customer centric approach.
Ability to understand customer requirements effectively and fulfilling them with an efficient and courteous service has always been our forte. Pan Asia Bank is also known for the innovative products that have been introduced to meet customer needs. Therefore in our branding efforts, we will be making use of those core strengths to differentiate Pan Asia Bank from the competition.
Another advantage of choosing this approach is that our staff and processes are already strongly aligned to deliver a superior service to our customers.
Last year, we developed a three-year strategic plan and the results that we have delivered so far in 2015, are in line with such plan.
We will also engage in some CSR initiatives to celebrate our 20th anniversary along with staff engagement activities. The key strength of the success of Pan Asia Bank has always been the commitment and dedication of our staff. Hence, I am confident that Pan Asia Bank is now poised for the next wave of growth to become a formidable player in the banking and financial sector in Sri Lanka.

IATA Environmental Assessment Programme gathers momentum
	
	The International Air Transport Association (IATA) announced that five airlines have recently successfully completed stages of the IATA Environmental Assessment (IEnvA) programme.IEnvA is an innovative, voluntary, two-stage evaluation process designed to drive airline environmental performance improvements through independent assessment.
Finnair and South African Airways have completed the IEnvA Stage 2 assessment, the highest level of IEnvA achievement. This ensures that an airline has implemented all of the IEnvA Programme Standards, identified and mitigated its significant environmental impacts and has set performance targets. Stage 2 also certifies that an airline has developed processes for monitoring and reviewing its performance against its environmental targets and objectives.
Icelandair, Qatar Airways and SriLankan Airlines have completed IEnvA Stage 1, which ensures an airline has established a foundation and framework for its environmental management system. Stage 1 also certifies an airline has identified and complied with its environmental legal requirements.
These five airlines join a growing number of carriers that have already successfully completed IEnvA Stage 1 Assessments, namely Air Transat, Kenya Airways, LATAM, LATAM Cargo and Malaysia Airlines.
In addition to safety, environmental responsibility is the highest priority for the industry. The new IATA Environmental Assessment sits alongside our industry-wide carbon-reduction targets as a programme for ensuring airlines not only meet but also exceed their day-to-day operational environmental obligations and performance.
Our congratulations to Icelandair, Qatar Airways and SriLankan Airlines for completing Stage 1 and I would particularly like to commend Finnair and South African Airways for being the first to complete the Stage 2 assessment. These airlines are among the pioneers in this critical new programme.
IATAs audits and assessment schemes are impartial, independent evaluations designed to improve industry performance against global benchmarks. The IATA Operational Safety Audit has done much to help improve airline safety and we expect that the IEnvA will do the same for environmental standards, said IATA DirectorGeneral and CEO Tony Tyler.
The IEnvA programme uses environmental standards and recommended practices developed specifically for the aviation sector by a joint team of environmental experts from within and outside the industry. These are based on recognized environmental management system principles, such as ISO 14001. Assessments are conducted by accredited independent organisations with competencies in aviation and environmental auditing.
IEnvA has been developed in conjunction with airlines so that it addresses industry needs and specific concerns.
IEnvA assesses environmental performance against sustainability standards across a broad range of disciplines, including (but not limited to) the management of air quality and emissions, noise, fuel consumption and operational efficiency, recycling, energy efficiency, sustainable procurement and biofuel utilization.
As a result, IEnvA helps airlines to simplify regulatory compliance, demonstrate good governance and achieve financial savings from the better use of resources. The programme adopts a modular approach, initially focusing on flight operations and corporate activities at a global level with later expansion into other activities including catering, ground operations and maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO).
The IEnvA Programme is complementary to the aviation industrys four-pillar strategy for addressing climate change impacts. In 2009 the industry agreed to cap emissions through carbon-neutral growth from 2020 and cut net emissions by 50 percent (compared to 2005) by 2050, through a combination of technology and operations improvements, better use of infrastructure and the implementation of a global market-based measure.

Defeated ex-minister attempting to grab my seat: Geetha
	
UPFA Galle District MP Geetha Kumarasinghe said the dual citizenship allegation was a conspiracy hatched by a former minister who was defeated at the general election in an effort to enter parliament.
She said she contested the general election after relinquishing her Switzerland citizenship.
I say this with responsibility that I am not a dual citizen of Sri Lanka and Switzerland. I cancelled my dual citizenship before the election, Ms. Kumarasinghe said.
She said she was the first woman who voluntarily cancelled the Switzerland citizenship which was a huge privilege for me.
I came to help the people by sacrificing a huge privilege I had. Switzerland is one of the best countries to live in. No one in history has canceled a Swiss citizenship like I have done. I did it despite objections from my husband and daughter. I cried a lot on that day. I even gave up my career as an artiste, she said.
Ms. Kumarasinghe said she had all the legal documents to prove her cancellation of Switzerland citizenship and that she was 100 per cent sure of securing her MP's post.
I am the only woman MP in the Southern province who was elected to parliament with 65, 000 preferential votes. I sacrificed all my privileges to help the people. What wrong have I done to face such allegations, she asked.
Ms. Kumarasinghe said the law was initially introduced to prevent Gotabaya Rajapksa and Basil Rajapaksa contesting the general election and added that she would file a case demanding compensations for the embarrassment caused to her by making false allegations.
She alleged that a certain minister who has Swiss citizenship by marrying a Swiss lady was closely working with the president while she was being harassed.
Am I being treated like this for supporting former president Mahinda Rajapaksa, she asked. (Ajith Siriwardana)

Eyeing and vying for three media outfits up for sale!
	
A story that has gone viral says that the ownership of at least three leading private media institutions is about to change hands.
One of the three institutions carrying the on sale tag is an electronic one and the other two are entirely print. The competent authority of two of these institutions is said to be a one-time powerful political figure. Incidentally, it is these two institutions  one electronic committed to promoting sports and the other a print one, run by the same owners  that are now attracting most bids, they say. 
Meanwhile, the owners of the electronic media institution on sale, have decided to accept the bid made by a media boss who had been a third eye to the former strongman. This means the Green politico who was eyeing this media institution is no longer in the scene. However, so far no bid has been accepted for the print media institution run by the same owners, they say. Meanwhile, a rumour making rounds says that a certain Ministerial one is set to buy a print media institution that took off the ground quite recently

He didnt wait for the promised earful!
	
The outlay on the construction of the railway extension to Kataragama from Matara estimated by a team of engineers has subsequently been highly bloated. This is a finding by the new Ministerial one presiding over Transport, they say.
The Ministerial one disclosed his findings to the mass media recently.
It was the former strongman himself who handled the Highway portfolio in the previous administration and he was directly responsible for all preliminaries relating to the proposed Matara  Hambantota rail line, which was incidentally a pet project of his. So it was obvious that he was the target of the barbed comment of the Ministerial one, but he is answerable for the implied arbitrary upward revision of the initial project estimate.
On hearing that the new Ministerial ones finding had placed the former strongman in a tight spot, several politicos close to the latter had called him to make solicitous inquiries. The former strongman had a ready answer to these callers: I hope to give this fellow an earful when I meet him next time. Some people dont know that when they point one finger at another person, three fingers would invariably point at themselves!
Two or three days later, both the former strongman and the new Ministerial one holding the Transport portfolio attended a function held to felicitate the old boys of two leading Colombo schools on their being elected to Diyawanna, some of them raised to Ministerial rank.
On seeing the former strongman arriving for the function, the Ministerial one quietly slipped out, they say.

The fact that Mangi has been given a Ministry under which there are  no corporations or statutory bodies to serve as agencies generating jobs for his constituents too has influenced his decision not to face the hustings again. Earlier, he had under his charge the Telecom, a good job provider, but it has been assigned to another Ministerial one now.

HNB takes top 100 Singithi depositors on exciting tour
	
Hatton National Bank (HNB) recently rewarded the children who emerged as the top 100 depositors in Singithi Savings Month 2014 with an exciting educational tour to popular attractions in and around Colombo.
The first stop on the tour was Water World Kelaniya, the only public aquarium in Sri Lanka and home to the first-ever Underwater Tunnel Aquarium in South Asia. Located on a scenic five-acre property on the banks of the Kelani River, Water World houses over 150 display tanks and ponds, a Shark Dome and over 10,000 living aquatic organisms.
Thereafter, the tour moved to the Liquid Plant Centre and Powder Plant of Fonterra Brands Lanka in Biyagama, the local office of the worlds largest exporter of dairy products. The children had the opportunity of visiting the Fonterra Liquid Plant Centre for milk powder blending and packing, which produces almost half a million packs of milk powder every day and the Fonterra Powder Plant, the largest and most sophisticated yoghurt processing facility in Sri Lanka.
Meanwhile, the winners of the art competition conducted during Savings Month 2014 were rewarded with a guided tour of the historic Ratmalana Airport, which has a rich heritage of 80 years as one of the oldest airports in South Asia. During the Second World War, it was used as a Royal Air Force base and civilianised planes flew into Ratmalana from Perth, Western Australia, on what was at the time the worlds longest non-stop air route. For decades Ratmalana served as Colombos sole international airport before the construction of Bandaranaike International Airport in the 1960s.
The art competition winners were then taken around Colombo to witness and experience popular landmarks of the city such as the Parliament Complex, Old Parliament, Diyatha Uyana, Dutch Hospital, Independence Square and Galle Face Green. The children were mostly from outstation areas and cherished the opportunity to visit these attractions.
HNB Singithi Savings Month is held throughout the month of October each year to commemorate the World Childrens Day and World Thrift Day, which fall on October 1 and 31, respectively. The HNB Singithi brand consists of Singithi Kirikatiyo, Singithi Lama and HNB Teen, which are specialized accounts offered as soon as a child is born, is enrolled in school, becomes a teenager and becomes a youth, respectively.
The 2015 Singithi Savings Month will be carried out in October and many fantastic tours and other rewards have been planned by HNB to incentivise children to save for their future.

Mahela to join NZ domestic T20
	
	Sri Lankan batting colossus Mahela Jayawardene will become one of the biggest names to grace New Zealand's Twenty20 cricket competition after he was signed by the Central Stags on Tuesday.
	Stags general manager Lance Hamilton confirmed Jayawardene had put pen to paper and will join them for the final six games of the Super Smash, and finals weekend in New Plymouth in December if they make it.
	The 38-year-old veteran of 149 tests and 448 one-day internationals is comfortably the highest profile Stags recruit and sits up with Muttiah Muralitharan and Brett Lee (both Wellington Firebirds) as one of the biggest names to feature in the 10-year history of the New Zealand T20 competition.
	"He's one of the greats of the game - certainly the biggest signing we've had," Hamilton said.
	Originally he was pencilled in for the entire 10 rounds but there was a slight hitch in the form of the Shane Warne-Sachin Tendulkar T20 all-stars league at US baseball stadiums, which Jayawardene signed up for. It means he won't arrive until Central's round five clashes with Wellington at Nelson's Saxton Oval on November 19.
	It gives the Stags the most imposing top order in the competition, with Jayawardene joining new Black Cap George Worker and the destructive Jesse Ryder who returns to the team where he made his name after stints with Wellington and Otago.
	Jayawardene called time on his glittering 18-year international career after the World Cup in March. In 149 tests he topped 11,000 runs and averaged 49.84, and his influence continued in retirement as he was hired by England as a batting consultant for next month's series against Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates.
	He had mixed success in T20 leagues in England and West Indies in recent months. In eight games for Sussex, Jayawardene averaged 34 at a strike rate of 141, while in the Caribbean Premier League he struggled in scoring just 33 runs from seven innings at 4.71.
	In 187 career T20 matches Jayawardene averages 28 at a strike rate of 130, including 28 half-centuries and two centuries.
	"He's a world class player and a quality person and we're not too concerned about his stats at the moment. We informed the squad and everyone is pretty excited about having him on board. We're sure he'll contribute in many ways as well as runs," Hamilton said.
	The deal was six weeks in the making and was assisted by the Stags' sponsorship from the Nelson Marlborough Institute of Technology. Jayawardene will also undertake promotional work for the NMIT which has links with a Sri Lankan university.
	"If we were going to go for an overseas player it needed to be someone who was going to add value to the team and the culture, and a big enough name to help us attract some commercial interest," Hamilton said.
	New Zealand Cricket will also be relieved the Super Smash has a genuine star name, in the absence of Black Caps test players who take on Australia throughout November, then return home for the first test against Sri Lanka during finals weekend from December 11-13.
	The Super Smash already had some gloss removed with the scrapping of the lucrative Champions League which was a huge incentive for the six teams. It also made it tougher for major associations to attract imports without that lure, and made them weigh up whether it was worth the expense of a big name signing without the potential financial rewards.(Stuff)

	Several Opposition MPs today urged the government to hold a referendum to implement the UNHRC recommendations including a Hybrid Court to investigate war crimes allegations in Sri Lanka.
	United Peoples Freedom Alliance (UPFA) MP Wimal Weerawansa said if the UNHRC approves the resolution, Sri Lankans should have the liberty to decide if they want any foreign involvement in solving internal issues.
	If the people feel they are fine with the UNHRC recommendations and a court with foreign judges and investigators to probe alleged war crimes in Sri Lanka, then the government can go ahead with the proposals. We also request the people to urge their MPs to vote against an Act to be tabled in parliament asking for the approval of the UN recomendations, he told a news conference.
	Meanwhile, MP Udaya Gammanpila said they were considering seeking legal advice on challenging the UN report in the Supreme Court.
	MP Dinesh Gunawardane urged the government to pull back from co-sponsoring the US backed resolution on Sri Lanka and said if not the sovereignty and integrity of the country would be severely damaged.
	Co-sponsoring a resolution is similar to writing ones own death certificate and is a bad precedent to other countries. This move has also put our allies in a difficult situation, he said.
	MP Vasudeva Nanayakkara said the government decision to back the US-led resolution was a betrayal similar to the 1815 agreement signed with the British. We all know the nature of the US. They just want to get closer to their prey, he said.(Lahiru Pothmulla)WATCH

There are four well-known siblings, all products of a leading school in the city. They all shone in the gentlemans game before taking to the game where even gentlemen eventually turn ungentlemanly.
The foursome took four separate ways to politics. They entered the fray at the last general poll and two of them made it to Diyawanna. Of them one is a Ministerial one and the other one a back-bencher, a comedown for him from a high office.
A ceremony was held the other day at the school where the foursome studied to felicitate an illustrious coach of the gentlemans game and the mother of the four siblings, a former teacher of the same school too attended this ceremony.
The four siblings seated next to each other in the same row in the audience were the cynosure of all eyes at this ceremony. O! Not for the reason you may have immediately guessed!
The four siblings were looking straight even without making a casual glance sideways. Right from the start of the function up to its conclusion not a word or a smile passed between them either!

He could even defeat the former strongman at the latters home turf of Beliatta, he added.

There were two powerful secretarial ones during the previous regime, who often came in for flak from opposition political quarters, for their alleged involvement in sleaze.
One of these secretarial ones returned to the country recently ending his self-exile. He is said to be the proud owner of several valuable properties in Down Under including three mansions. When he was in office under the previous regime, he had wielded such power and energy that even his Ministerial one had to seriously consider leaving the government.
This white collar one is said to be now planning to find his way into a powerful position in the yahapalanaya. He is, of course, encouraged by his one-time pals now ensconced in the regime thanks to the national unity formula. However, there is a big obstacle in his way; the Ministerial one whom he disdained once, has now become a power to be reckoned with!
The other white collar one looking for a place on the gravy train in yahapalanya is a former Secretarial one who was involved in sleaze in the road sector. The prospects of this one are very bright for his patron saint is none other than a businessman-sibling from a family that has now attained royal status, they say.

This new Ministerial one held a similar post in the previous regime as well. The very day he assumed duties, he had ordered the head of his private staff to arrange his lunch at the Ministry itself.
He had also given the aides the menu for his lunch and ordered that in addition to the other delicacies, there should be a Tebu-leaf sambol as a must. The Ministerial one, a diabetic, had decided to take Tebu-leaf, which is said to be an effective herbal medicine for the disease as part of his mid-day meal, they say.
One day it was raining cats and dogs and the aides were not able to find Tebu leaves for the routine sambol for their boss.
The Ministerial one who sat down to lunch that day quickly noticed that the Tebu-leaf sambol dish was missing from the table laid out for him. And that got his goat. Disdaining the excuse his aides gave him, the Ministerial one raved at them for neglecting their duty, they say. The personal aides knew that incurring the wrath of the Ministerial one could lead to even loss of their jobs and they hit upon a plan to ensure an uninterrupted supply of Tebu leaves -- to raise a Tebu crop in the Ministry premises!

This Ministerial brat who attracted limelight when he had to appear in courts over an issue connected with a lass is back in the news: he had this time round commandeered a limousine in the vehicle park of his fathers Ministry which he had stormed commando-style.
According to the Ministry employees the vehicle he took away was the one reserved for the Deputy Ministerial one and the young man had been very rude to the security men when they protested against the brash act.
The Ministerial brat had later used choicy words on the Deputy when the latter faulted him for forcibly removing the vehicle.
Angered by the brats rude response, the Deputy too had resorted to a  tit-for-tat action: he had taken away about a dozen of the vehicles from the Ministry vehicle park.
When the authorities concerned had inquired from the Deputy why he took away vehicles from the Ministry fleet for no apparent reason, the latter had in a sharp rejoinder asked why they did not question the Ministerial one when about one and a half dozen of vehicles were taken away from the fleet on his instructions.
By the way, the other brat of the Ministerial one, now a Diyawanna member also has already made a name for his bellicosity, they say.
And they all have vowed to uphold yahapalanaya!

The armoury of the Rakna Lanka Security Service affiliated to the Defence Ministry has been sealed following complaints to the police that the weapons belonging to the Security Service had been used illegally during the just concluded Presidential election.
A senior police officer said the armoury situated within the BMICH premises would be checked on Monday after a court order is secured. He added the armoury was sealed after the Anti-Corruption Organization which had been formed by several organizations including the Jathika Hela Urumaya (JHU) lodged complaints that the weapons from this armoury had been used for election violence.
He added that documents belonging to the security service were being checked by a special police team.
The Rakna Lanka Security service was formed under a special gazette notification to provide security for institutions under the Defence Ministry.
Meanwhile four containers containing goods believed to have been imported through the Rakna Lanka Security Service to distribute among voters during the Presidential elections were also sealed yesterday. They were sealed after police received information that several suspicious looking containers had been parked in the BMICH vehicle park.(Indika Rmanayake and Bimal Syaman Jayasinghe)

Dynastic rule helped war victory: Namal
	
MP Namal Rajapaksa in an interview to NDTV has said that his family's dynastic rule led to the military victory over the LTTE.
He said the close knit ties between his father and his uncle, the Defence Secretary, Gotabaya Rajapaksa, was responsible for Lanka's military victory over the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam or LTTE.
"The war was ended because of this bond within the family," Namal said at the office of his law firm in the heart of Colombo. "Any leader needs someone they can trust as secretary of defence. My father was able to take strong decisions as an individual along with the leaders of the government but the leader needs someone they can trust," he added.
When asked whether this was a feudal argument in a modern democracy, where an elected leader needs to trust their colleagues regardless of family affiliations, Namal said, "We always trusted each other, but can I ask you is it a crime that I became the President's son"
The new government has filed a criminal case, alleging that in the early hours of January 9, when it became clear Mr Rajapaksa was losing the election, he called a secret meeting at his residence attended by top officials to plot the declaration of Emergency in Sri Lanka.
Namal denied any such meeting, but acknowledged that officials may have come to see him.
"Various people came to speak to him right throughout the night. It's normal at the end of the election, the government officials always come and talk."

Electoral reforms by end of year: PM
	
The new electoral system would be enacted end of this year with the support of all political parties, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said today.
Speaking during a ceremony organised by the Department of Elections to mark its 60th Anniversary, the Prime Minister said new electoral system would be in place by the end of this year after reaching an agreement on a proper electoral system.
He said the challenge before the parties today was to decide whether the country should go for a system where the Proportional Representation (PR) and the First Past the Post (FPP) system go parallel with each other or a mixed system as in New Zealand.
He said the government hoped to increase the representation of women in the local bodies to 25 percent from the next local government elections, even by increasing the number of seats in local bodies.
Some may say there is no time for it but I would like to insist that we should implement this without wasting time, he said.
Mr. Wickremesinghe said one must also look at the change in the political culture that was brought about by the social media.
He said social media have had such an impact on politics that people had begun to vote for those whom no one ever would think of coming into power.
Citing an example he said that US Democrat Hillary Clinton had met unexpected competition from a fellow party member to become the Presidential candidate.

Lawlessness victimizing the public
There is little doubt that criminal activity in this country has drastically increased in recent months. The underworld has risen once again. And just this year, we have seen an unusual number of rapes, murders and shooting incidents.
While all societies have to deal with some criminal activity, the incidents of recent months have gone to show that our law enforcement does not appear to be as vigilant or properly equipped as it used to be. Two incidents that took place in September alone are cases in point.
The Police have clearly mishandled the recent case of the gruesome rape and murder of the five-year-old child. The initial haphazard arrests that were made appear to have been made without adequate investigation. On the one hand, the teenager who was initially arrested has been further remanded. Meanwhile, another suspect has allegedly confessed to the crime. If the latter is proven to be true, then the life and future of a second innocent child has been completely destroyed.
Commissioner of the Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka, Dr. Prathiba Mahanamahewa, has stated that what happened to this teenager was a grave injustice.
The rights of the 17-year-old boy have been violated by his unjustifiable arrest, Dr. Mahanamahewa said, speaking to the Daily Mirror. Police may arrest people as long as there is sufficient evidence against them. The arrest of the student raises the doubts as to whether he was arrested after due investigation.
Lanka Teachers Union Secretary Joseph Stalin had also condemned the police treatment of the suspects in custody as being unacceptable.
As soon as the suspects were arrested, the Police acted as if the suspects had already been convicted, Mr. Stalin said. One precious life has already (been) lost, and another life is being subjected to Police injustice. [http://goo.gl/rJ4NWE]
Then there is the shooting incident that occurred inside the premises of the Kaduwela Magistrate Court, which is equally troubling. It goes to show that the Police are unable to maintain law and order even in places where criminals are brought  places that are supposed to be the most secure.
With heinous crimes on the increase, the Government is still preoccupied with investigating my family. What this clearly shows is that the Government is desperately trying to shift the publics attention away from the serious challenges this country is now facing.
The question now is why enough resources are not being invested to upgrade our Police service to adequately equip them in handling the serious crimes that are taking place in this country. Is spending public funds to seek personal revenge more important and more justifiable than upholding the safety and justice of Sri Lankas public Sadly, that seems to be the case.

Pressure on media will increase, says N. Ram
	
	Paid news, political pressure and buying of media institutions by powerful companies which have no media background will increase the pressure on media, a top media personage from India said yesterday.
	Mr. N. Ram, the chairman of Kasturi and Sons Ltd, the Publisher of the Hindu Group of Newspapers, who gave the keynote address at the Esmond Wickremesinghe Media Freedom awards ceremony, said the exotic world of aggressive and unorthodox publishing and business strategising for growing newspapers throws out of the window most of the things learnt from journalism school or the elements of journalism. He said the situation had led to some critical debates on a wider phenomenon  paid news, not as a rogue practice but as a deeper and industry-wide phenomenon that was not confined to election coverage. Paid news is run to pass off an advertisement, a piece of propaganda...as news. Paid news does not disclose to the reader that this information has been paid for, he said.
	He said, the pressure from politicians and the public to impose external regulation through legislation would increase. Mr. Ram said demonstrating that transparency, accountability, and social responsibility are more than slogans, and introducing codes of values and codes of good practice binding journalists and the media industry, would help media organisations to overcome this situation. He stressed the need for self-regulatory mechanisms, such as independent news ombudsmen, within major news organisations. Mr. Ram lauded Sri Lanka for removing defamation laws, giving the credit to the government and parliament of 2002. He stressed that the Press Complains Commission should be strengthened by statutory underpinning, allocation of adequate funds by parliament, and the provision of an appellate tribunal that would satisfy legal requirements. Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe (the son of Mr. Esmond Wickremesinghe), who was the chief guest at the ceremony, delineated the struggle for media freedom in Sri Lanka relating to the takeover of Lake House by the United Front government in 1973. He said he would leave it to the media to reward those who had stood up for media freedom. Neither I nor anyone from my family will interfere in the Esmond Wickremesinghe award scheme; I leave the decisions to the media, he said. Edmond Ranasinghe, the founding editor of Divaina stressed that the press should highlight the importance of the change that was brought about on January 8, 2015, and play a role in sustaining it. The inaugural Esmond Wickremesighe award was given to Udayan Newspapers Ltd. (Yohan Perera)

SL judicial system isnt equipped to probe war crimes: Zeid
	
UN Human Rights Chief Zeid Raad Al Hussein justifying the OISL report recommendation for a hybrid special court to address accountability issues in Sri Lanka, said the domestic judicial system is not equipped to conduct an investigation into the crimes listed in the findings.
Addressing the ongoing 30th UNHRC session a short while ago via a video statement, the High Commissioner pointed out the breadth and magnitude of the crimes documented in the OISL report cannot be probed by local judicial systems and emphasized the need for international participation in the mechanism that is due to be established to address accountability concerns.
He also noted that although the scope for freedom of expression has improved, cases of surveillance have been reported on district levels in the North and East. The High Commissioner also expressed concern over the 19 arrests made under the PTA and 14 cases of torture that have been reported since January 2015.
HC Zeid also called on the government to criminalize hate speech and added that he hopes the recommendations are taken up with due consideration. (Lakna Paranamanna)
The full statement of UN Human Rights Chief:
Mr President, Excellencies,
Ladies and Gentlemen,
I am pleased to present the report of OHCHR on promoting reconciliation, accountability and human rights in Sri Lanka, including the findings of the comprehensive investigation mandated by Human Rights Council resolution 25/1. As you know, following signals of engagement by the newly elected Government of Sri Lanka in January 2015, the Human Rights Council decided to defer consideration of the report until this thirtieth session.
The context in which this report is presented is very different to the one during which it was mandated. The election of a new President and Government on a platform centred on good governance, human rights and the rule of law presents a historic opportunity to address the grave human rights violations that have wracked Sri Lanka, including through accountability and institutional reform, and to lay the basis for long-term reconciliation and peace.
We are also seeing renewed engagement by the new Government with OHCHR and the UN human rights mechanisms. The previous Government categorically rejected the Human Rights Council-mandated investigation and refused access and cooperation. More worryingly, it resorted to an unrelenting campaign of intimidation and harassment against victims, witnesses and representatives of civil society who might seek to provide information to OHCHR.
The new Government did not alter the stance on cooperation with the investigation, nor did it admit the investigation team into the country. However, it has engaged more constructively with me and my Office on possible options for an accountability and reconciliation process.
It also invited the Special Rapporteur on truth, justice, reparations and guarantees of non-recurrence to make a technical visit in March/April 2015, and will host the Working Group on Enforced and Involuntary Disappearances in November 2015. I hope this will mark the start of a closer engagement with the Special Procedures, whose mandates can offer valuable advice and technical assistance.
Mr President,
The Presidential election of 8 January 2015 marked a watershed in the political environment in Sri Lanka. The manifesto of the new Government included a 100-day programme of important constitutional reforms and other important measures. The Chief Justice, who was controversially impeached in January 2013, was briefly reinstated and Parliamentary elections subsequently held on 17 August 2015. Since January 2015 space has significantly opened up for freedom of expression, at least in Colombo.
But surveillance and interference continue to be reported at the district level in the North and East, including harassment and intimidation by military and intelligence services. This demonstrates the pervasiveness of the structures and institutional cultures that created the repressive environment of the past, and highlights the importance of much more fundamental security-sector reforms.
Six years after the end of the war, many displaced populations have yet to achieve durable solutions, particularly with regard to livelihoods. One major continuing problem is the occupation by the military of private land, although the Government has proceeded with some land releases in recent months. Women-headed households, numbering nearly 60,000 in the Northern Province, are especially vulnerable, including to sexual harassment, exploitation and violence.
The Government has yet to clarify the number and identity of detainees still held under the Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA) and emergency regulations. Reports have continued to suggest the existence of secret and unacknowledged places of detention. These require urgent investigation. According to local civil society sources, from January to August this year, 19 people were arrested under the PTA. 12 of them remain in detention and 14 cases of torture have been reported to us by credible sources since January 2015. I welcome the Governments commitment to review and repeal the PTA, which has long provided a legal context facilitating arbitrary detention, unfair trials and torture.
While the past six months have seen an abatement of religious tensions and violence, incidents against Muslim and Christian communities continue to be reported. There have been no prosecutions in relation to the June 2014 attacks by the Buddhist group Bodu Bala Sena on the Muslim community in Aluthgama This highlights the continuing need for the Government to promote inter-communal tolerance and to criminalize hate speech and incitement to violence.
Since January 2015, President Sirisena and other government figures have emphasized reconciliation in public statements. On Independence Day, on 4 February, the Government issued a special declaration of peace in three languages, expressing sympathy and regret for all the victims of the 30-year armed conflict, and pledging to advance national reconciliation, justice and equality for all citizens. The Government also established a new Office of National Unity and Reconciliation, headed by former President Kumaratunga, to drive progress on key issues such as the release of detainees and restitution of civilian land occupied by the military.
In our previous reports to the Human Rights Council, we have described the total failure of domestic mechanisms to conduct credible investigations, clarify the truth of past events, ensure accountability and provide redress to victims.
The Presidential Commission to Investigate into Complaints regarding Missing Persons that was appointed by the previous Government has continued its work, despite widespread concerns raised about its credibility and effectiveness. We believe this Commission should be disbanded and its pending cases transferred to a credible and independent institution established in consultation with families of the disappeared.
Since January there have been a few promising developments in some emblematic cases previously highlighted by OHCHR:
On 25 June a former army staff sergeant was convicted of the murder of eight Tamil civilians in Mirusuvil, Jaffna District, in 2000. This is a rare case of a conflict-related violation being successfully prosecuted, albeit after twelve years.
In March 2015, three navy personnel and a former police officer were arrested in relation to the killing, in November 2006 of parliamentarian Nadarajah Raviraj.
In August 2015, police also announced that they had arrested several military personnel in relation to the disappearance of journalist and cartoonist Prageeth Eknaligoda.
But many other criminal cases languish before the courts, including those concerning the killing of five students on the Trincomalee beachfront in January 2006, and of 17 humanitarian workers for Action Contre la Faim in Muttur in August 2006 also.
Mr President,
The comprehensive investigation presented in this report was undertaken by a special team constituted within OHCHR. I am grateful to the three distinguished experts  Martti Ahtisaari, Silvia Cartwright, and Asma Jahangir  who have played a supportive and advisory role in this process. Special procedure mandate holders also provided input to the investigation.
The aim of the investigation was to identify the patterns of violations of international human rights and humanitarian law, not only during the final stage of the armed conflict but during the whole nine year period covered by its mandate. The timeframe covered by the investigation, the extent of the violations, the amount of information available, and the constraints to the investigation, including lack of access to Sri Lanka and witness protection concerns, posed enormous challenges.
The investigation found that there are reasonable grounds to believe that gross violations of international human rights law and serious violations of international humanitarian law were committed by all parties during the period under review. Indeed, if established before a court of law, many of the allegations may amount to war crimes, and/or crimes against humanity.
These findings are detailed in the accompanying 250-page investigation report, and I will highlight only key elements today:
We found reasonable grounds to believe the Sri Lankan security forces and paramilitary groups associated with them were implicated in widespread and unlawful killings of civilians and other protected persons. Tamil politicians, humanitarian workers and journalists were particularly targeted. The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) also unlawfully killed civilians perceived to hold sympathies contrary to the LTTE, or suspected as informers, as well as rival Tamil political figures, public officials and academics. Civilians were also killed or injured in indiscriminate suicide bombings and claymore mine attacks carried out by LTTE.
We also investigated allegations of extrajudicial executions of identified LTTE cadres and unidentified individuals in or around 18 May 2009, and established in several cases that they appear to have been killed after surrendering to the Sri Lankan military.
We documented long-standing patterns of arbitrary arrest and detention by government security forces, and of abductions by paramilitary organizations linked to them, typically in unmarked white vans, which often reportedly led to enforced disappearances and extrajudicial killings.
We also documented the widespread torture by the Sri Lankan security forces, particularly in the immediate aftermath of the armed conflict, when former LTTE members and civilians were detained en masse.
A particularly shocking finding is the widespread use of rape and other forms of sexual violence by security forces personnel against both male and female detainees.
We gathered information that reflected a pattern of abductions and of forced recruitment of adults by LTTE that became more prevalent towards the end of the conflict. The forced recruits were obliged to perform both military and support functions and were often denied contact with their families. Victims and families who tried to resist were physically mistreated, harassed and threatened.
We also documented extensive recruitment and use of children (including under the age of 15) by the LTTE over many years, which intensified during the last few months of the conflict. We gathered information on child recruitment by the Karuna Group after its split from the LTTE in 2004, with the apparent knowledge of the security forces.
Mr President,
We examined closely the impact of hostilities on civilians and civilian objects during the last months of the war. On the basis of the information available, there are reasonable grounds to believe that both the Government and LTTE failed to comply with key principles of international humanitarian law on the conduct of hostilities designed to protect civilians.
In particular, the report documents repeated shelling by Government forces impacting on hospitals and humanitarian facilities in the densely populated No Fire Zones which the Government itself had announced. The presence of LTTE cadres directly participating in hostilities and operating within the predominantly civilian population, launching attacks from close proximity to these locations, and the LTTE policy of forcing civilians to remain within areas of active hostilities, may also have violated international humanitarian law.
Our investigation also found that the Government placed considerable restrictions on humanitarian access, and may have deliberately blocked the delivery of sufficient food aid and medical supplies, essential to the survival of the civilian population. This may amount to the use of starvation of civilians as a method of warfare.
We also examined the manner in which screening processes were carried out at the end of the war to separate former LTTE combatants from civilians. Almost 300,000 IDPs were deprived of their liberty in camps for periods far beyond what is permissible under international law. There are also reasonable grounds to believe that IDPs were treated as suspects and detained because of their Tamil ethnicity, which may amount to discrimination and to the crime against humanity of persecution.
Mr President,
The sheer number of allegations, their gravity and recurrence and the similarities in their modus operandi, as well as the consistent pattern of conduct they indicate, all point to system crimes. Such acts cannot be treated as ordinary crimes: if established in a court of law, they may constitute international crimes, which are of interest to the international community.
I welcome the Governments commitments, made before this Council, to investigate these violations and ensure accountability, despite the opposition of some political parties and sections of the military and society. The unfortunate reality is, however, that Sri Lankas criminal justice system is not currently equipped to conduct an independent and credible investigation into allegations of this breadth and magnitude, or to hold accountable those responsible for such violations, as requested by the Council in resolution 25/1.
First, Sri Lanka lacks a reliable system for victim and witness protection, particularly in a context where the risk of reprisals is very high. A long-pending law was recently passed, but it is not yet operational. I note the Governments commitment to further review and strengthen the law to address various shortcomings that could compromise the independence and effectiveness of the new system.
Secondly, the domestic legal framework is inadequate to deal with international crimes of this magnitude. When Sri Lanka has prosecuted conflict-related cases, it has relied on offences in regular criminal law, such as murder. This approach fails to recognize the gravity of the crimes committed, their international character, or to duly acknowledge the harm caused to the victims. To fully reflect their gravity and bring redress to their victims, international crimes must be charged as such.
Thirdly, the States security sector and justice system have been distorted and corrupted by decades of impunity. The independence and integrity of key institutions such as the Attorney Generals Office and the Human Rights Commission remain compromised. The security forces, police and intelligence services have enjoyed near total impunity and have not undergone any significant reform since the armed conflict. A full-fledged vetting process should be designed to remove from office security forces personnel and public officials suspected of involvement in human rights violations.
This is why I have recommended the establishment of an ad hoc hybrid special court, integrating international judges, prosecutors, lawyers and investigators, mandated to try notably war crimes and crimes against humanity, with its own independent investigative and prosecuting organ, defence office and witness and victims protections programme. In a highly polarized environment, such a mechanism is essential to give all Sri Lankans, especially victims, confidence in the independence and impartiality of this process.
Judicial accountability should be accompanied by broader transitional justice measures, including truth-seeking and reparations, to ensure that the right of victims to redress is realized. These must be designed through a process of genuine, informed and participatory consultation, especially with victims and their families, and OHCHR stands ready to lend its assistance in this regard.
Mr President,
This is a time of tremendous hope. Sri Lanka can finally break the cycle of impunity that for so long wracked its past. This will require more than prosecuting a few emblematic cases, but rather a comprehensive approach, developed through a broad-based and victim-centred process of consultation, that draws on the full range of transitional justice measures of judicial accountability, truth-seeking, reparations, vetting and deep institutional reform.
I hope the recommendations made in our report will make an important contribution to this process, and emphasise OHCHR's readiness to continue to assist and support the development of credible accountability and transitional justice mechanisms that meet international standards. The Human Rights Council has played  and should continue to play  a critical role in encouraging progress on accountability and reconciliation in Sri Lanka.
I thank you Mr. President.

SL to assist with Maldives blast probe
	
		 		 
		 
			
An investigations team from Sri Lanka will travel to neigbouring Maldives to assist in the ongoing investigation into the explosion aboard the presidential speedboat carrying President Abdulla Yameen Abdul Gayoom and the First Lady on Monday morning, Haveeru Online reported.
Already five Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) officials from US were in the Maldives assisting the investigation, it said quoting a Maldivian Police spokesperson. A team from neighbouring Sri Lanka and India were also set to arrive in the Maldives for the investigation.
In addition to the FBI agents, a nine-member forensic team from Saudi Arabia were also assisting with the investigation, the Male based Haveeru Online said.
The Presidential delegation returned home Monday morning after concluding their visit to Saudi Arabia to perform the annual hajj pilgrimage.
The president was unhurt, but the first lady suffered a spinal fracture while presidential secretary Fathimath Mohamed Solih and bodyguard Abdu Nasir also suffered minor injuries including burns. They were still being treated at the state run Indira Gandhi Memorial Hospital (IGMH).
The Maldivian Government on Wednesday had suggested that Monday's explosion was likely a targeted attack, a claim that contradicts earlier accounts given by a top administration official.

	President Maithripala Sirisena addressing the 70th Session of the United Nations General Assembly in New York today, said that a fundamental requirement to achieve his government's main vision -- sustainable development and reconciliation -- was to deal with the past honestly and build a modern nation: and that in dealing with the past, Sri Lanka would use a process of truth seeking, justice, reparation and non-recurrence.
	President Maithripala Sirisena addressing the 70th Session of the United Nations General Assembly in New York yesterday, said that a fundamental requirement to achieve his government's main vision -- sustainable development and reconciliation -- was to deal with the past honestly and build a modern nation: and that in dealing with the past, Sri Lanka would use a process of truth seeking, justice, reparation and non-recurrence.
	It is imperative that Sri Lanka adopts a new social, economic and political approach to rise up to the challenges of the 21st century. In this regard, reconciliation receives priority attention in my country. The new consensual government under my leadership has already taken several steps to introduce and operationalize constitutional and institutional reforms required to accelerate the achievement of these goals, he said.
	Addressing the world leaders in Sinhala, the president said, Sri Lanka is a country that has suffered from conflict. While conflict brings destruction to a society, there are also many lessons that could be learnt during and after a conflict.
	We defeated one of the worlds most ruthless terror outfits. Equally, our post conflict experiences also have been significant. We believe that all these experiences can be shared fruitfully with other developing countries affected by terrorism. Sri Lanka remains prepared to engage in a more active dialogue with these countries and will continue to speak and advocate against terrorism."
	Speaking further he said, I believe that for global development, it is important to have a dialogue within the South as much as between the North and South. My country that represents the South can contribute immensely to nurture such North-South dialogue.
	My understanding of sustainable development is not to have isolated sector or group-wise development, but to have an inclusive model of development that is capable of raising standards globally. For this purpose, I stress on the need for a fresh universal approach.
	Commenting on the sustainable development, the Sri Lankan president said that the edifice of sustainable development should be built upon the foundation of self-discipline and equity. If this could be practised at the personal, community, national and global level, it would mark a giant leap forward for humanity.
	I propose that we, as national leaders, take cognizance of this self-discipline and equity-based approach when drawing relevant Action Plans for the future.
	Sri Lanka is a nation that respects the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations, and international conventions and treaties. A major objective of the UN is to recognize, safeguard and promote human rights. Sri Lanka remains committed to fulfil this responsibility. In this respect, we intend implementing a new programme and plan of action in Sri Lanka to advance human rights.

AIA rolls out Pensions Month this October
	
AIA is rolling out Pensions Month this October and asks how big is your pensions funding gap Most Sri Lankans dont know how much they will actually need at retirement, nor have they really thought about it. This is a mistake that could cost dearly, as in life you dont get to go back and start again. 
A significant gap exists, between the level of retirement income people are set to receive after retirement and the level of income they will actually need. The reasons range from increasing life expectancy, over confidence in or not contributing enough to existing savings plans, to not having any plans at all.
AIA Head of Marketing Suren Perera commented, Most people dont really have an idea how big a pension pot they will need when they retire but the hard truth is that retirement comes before you know it and more often than not, we are not ready for it. As a responsible company, our mission is to make sure that Sri Lankans are retirement ready and the only way to do so is to help them close the pensions gap - by educating people that you need to start saving earlier, start planning younger. 
Remember, the younger you are, the more time you have to build up a suitable fund to afford the lifestyle you desire at retirement. Your future is in your hands and you can make it comfortable.
AIA will take this message around the country, to educate everyone on the importance of bridging this pensions gap. Led by a dedicated team of wealth planners, the initiative will engage and educate customers and the public across the country.
AIA will launch a unique online retirement income calculator on October 8, the National Pensioners Day. This personalised calculator will open your eyes to the amount you will need for the retirement you desire and provide you with advice to get there. You can visit the AIA website on www.aialife.com.lk and have a go.

Fitch Ratings has today assigned HNB Grameen Finance Limited (HGL) a national long-term rating of A(lka) with a stable outlook.
HGLs rating reflects Fitchs expectation of support from its parent, Hatton National Bank PLC (HNB; AA-(lka)/Stable). This view is based on HNBs majority shareholding (51 percent), its involvement in the strategic direction of HGL through board representation and the common HNB brand.
The two-notch differential reflects HGLs limited role in the group. HGL is mainly engaged in the provision of microfinance, which is not a significant product for HNB as it accounted for 2.7 percent of the banks loan book at end-June 2015. Furthermore, there is limited operational and management integration of the entities.
HNB acquired 51 percent of HGL in November 2014 as part of a financial-sector consolidation programme. The bank rebranded the finance company and now has four seats on HGLs board, including the chairmanship.
HGL obtained a licence to operate as a finance company in 2010. It accounted for just 1.2 percent of the Licensed Finance Company sectors assets at end-March 2015.

Implementing UNHRC recommendations problematic: Nimal Siripala
	
	The implementation of the UNHRC, recommendations including the establishment of a war crimes tribunal, would create many legal issues in the countrys judicial system, as a new Constitution and a referendum would be required to implement the recommendations, the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) said today.
	The SLFP's senior vice president, Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva said the highest court in Sri Lanka was the Supreme Court and there was no hybrid court in Sri Lankas judicial system.
	The UNHRC report says that Sri Lanka needs to adopt feasibility legislation, specific legislation to facilitate a hybrid court mandated to probe war crimes committed by security forces personnel. We will need to change our Constitution in order to make room for a hybrid court, and we cant make these happen overnight, he said at a media briefing.
	The minister also said the UNHRC had further recommended that new legislation should be enacted to criminalise war crimes, crimes against humanity, genocide and enforced disappearances, and said new laws would have to be enacted by parliament in order to criminalise these subjects.
	According to our law, if a new law was passed, we cant apply that law to deal with what was done in the past. Therefore, if we are to introduce new laws and then to probe war crimes which were committed in the past, we will have to have a referendum to get the people's approval, he said; adding that passing new laws and changing the Constitution were not simple procedures and many problems would would arise when attempts were made to do so.
	He said the final position of the SLFP on the subject was not yet to decided as the special committee appointed by the party was still carefully perusing the contents of the final report adopted by the UNHRC.
	The minister thanked President Maithripala Sirisena for his achievements at the United Nations and said the delegation had been successful in watering down the resolution to some extent. However, our final stance on the resolution will be made public soon, he said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

Police beat me; took nude photos of me-School boy
	
"After being held at the Kotadeniyawa police station for three days, I was beaten and accused of committing this crime. They later took photos of me in the nude, said the schoolboy who was discharged after being on remand for 12 days on suspicion of having killed Seya Sadevmi.
After he was disharged by Court he made this revelation. He also said, On Wednesday the 16th four policemen came to my home. They were not in uniform. There was a friend of mine with me at that time. They took me and my friend with the laptop in a three wheeler saying they were taking us to record a statement. At the police station I was separated from my friend and taken to the back of the police station and forced to kneel. Then they beat me saying arent you the ones who committed this crime My mother was not allowed to see me and I was not given any dinner. They continued to beat me. Then they removed my clothes and began to examine me, an ASP also joined in and took photos of me in the nude
He said that he continued to deny the charge and say they were innocent of the crime. "They threatened to kill me, Later they took us to court and we were remanded in the Negombo Prison," he said. He said he was not involved in the crime and there were no photos of Seya on his laptop.
Kelum Aththanayake, the other suspect, said that he was taken into custody at about 2.30 am on the 16th. He said they covered his face and took him in a van to some place, but they did not remove his blindfold. They had later uncovered his face on the orders of the OIC. He was not kept at the police station but somewhere else. The police questioned me about my relationship with Seyas family and I replied to their questions. Later they took me to the police station but did not give me a proper meal. They hung me by a rope and severely beat me saying that we were responsible for the killing. They kept me for three days, and I continued to deny their accusations. They also beat me with a plastic pole. Later, after producing me in court and getting me remanded they continued to assault me.
The mother of the schoolboy said she was happy that her son had finally been released and lamented that he had been falsely accused. She said she was grateful to the attorneys, the class teacher, other teachers at the school and the media for helping to get her son released. "After my son was taken into custody by the police most people looked at us differently, and some looked at my son as though he were a beast. When my son was on remand our relatives helped me a lot. They shared my grief on hearing about the assault by the police, it is my firm wish to educate my son, therefore I appeal to everyone not to treat my son like a criminal," she said.(Tharindu Jayawardene and Tony Karunanayake)

	The new resolution on Sri Lanka that was submitted to the UNHRC last Thursday, was adopted without a vote a short while ago, as part of the proceedings of 40th meeting of the UNHR Councils ongoing 30th session.
	The resolution A/HRC/30/L.29, titled Promoting reconciliation, accountability and human rights in Sri Lanka was submitted before the Council last Thursday following a series of negotiations between the Sri Lankan delegation and the Core Group sponsors to which included delegations from Albania, Australia, Germany, Greece, Latvia, Montenegro, Poland, Romania, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, UK, Northern Ireland and the US.
	Meanwhile, the resolution also enjoyed the support of 25 more additional co-sponsors.
	It was submitted last Thursday about five hours behind schedule, due to setbacks that resulted from prolonged negotiations over its language, as objections were raised against certain paragraphs and wording included in the draft text by the Sri Lankan delegation.
	However, eventually Sri Lanka decided to co-sponsor the resolution once a consensus was reached over its content.
	The resolution while welcoming the governments recognition an accountability process to uphold the rule of law, affirms the importance of having independent judicial and prosecutorial institutions led by personnel known for integrity and impartiality and has further noted the importance of participation in a Sri Lankan judicial mechanism, including the Special Counsels office, of Commonwealth and other foreign judges, defence lawyers, and authorized prosecutors and investigators.
	The resolution has also recognised the need for accountability and reconciliation process for the violations and abuses committed by the LTTE as highlighted in the recently released OISL (OHCHR Investigation on Sri Lanka) report.
	Moreover, it has called for the OHCHR to continue to monitor Sri Lankas progress in the implementation of its recommendations and other relevant processes linked to reconciliation, accountability, and human rights and calls for the High Commissioners Office to present an oral update to the UNHRC at its 32nd session as well as a comprehensive report followed by discussion on the implementation of the present resolution at its 34th session.

Gota rejects account allegation
	
Former Defense Secretary Gotabaya Rajapaska yesterday rejected allegations of holding an account at the Bank of Ceylon Taprobane Branch with a balance of Rs.8 billion.
He said it was an official account set up with cabinet approval with the funds to be spent for the construction of the Army headquarters building at Pelawatta
Mr. Rajapaskas statement follows:
An allegation has been levelled against me that I have an account in the Taprobane Branch of the Bank of Ceylon with a balance of Rs.8 billion. This is grossly misleading and appears to discredit my reputation with ulterior motive. As I know there is an Operational Account held with the Bank of Ceylon Taprobane Branch dedicated for the use of financing the construction of Army headquarters building at Pelawatta. This account was created with the Approval of the Cabinet from the revenue from the sale of land at Galle Face, Colombo where the Army headquarters was located. After the relocation and construction work was started, withdrawals were to be made from it based on the progress of the construction work undertaken by various contractors and suppliers. The account is operated by the Chief Accountant and other authorized officials of the Ministry of Defence under the overall supervision of the Secretary of Defence.
All cheques are issued with two signatures upon the receipts of certified payment vouchers. As I recall, the Account was open with the total receipts of about Rs.20 billion in 2011 and withdrawals have been made each year thereafter for the payment of certified claims from contractors. Names and signatures of Authorized persons are available with the Bank and chief Accountant of the ministry. The balance as at the last day of my holding office was certainly over Rs.8 billion. The figures can be verified from the Treasury as annual deposit balance is reported to the Government balance Sheet.
As I have ceased to be the Secretary to the Ministry of Defence, my successor is the automatic custodian of that Account and he can verify all these. My name appears in the signature card in my capacity as secretary Defence along with other authorized officials and hence it has nothing to do with my personal account. Therefore, there is no truth whatsoever that I have a personal account in the Bank of Ceylon with Rs.8 billion. I deny this completely and request the Secretary to verify this with the bank and the Treasury and disclose the correct situation on this account.

The ongoing controversy and demand for Chief Justice 44, Mohan Peiris to resign ,took another turn as the Attorney Generals Department informed the Chief Justice not to attend todays grand ceremony to mark the 130th anniversary of Sri Lankas Attorney Generals Department.
The AGs decision came following Saturdays Bar Association of Sri Lanka (BASL) Executive Council resolution, the Daily Mirror reliably learns. At the meeting the BASL Ex-Co has decided to walk out if CJ Peiris attended the ceremony. BASL head Upul Jayasuriya told the Daily Mirror, that at Saturdays meeting they had decided to walk out from the BMICH venue as a mark of protest if Mr. Peiris was seen there. This decision has already been conveyed to Attorney General Yuvanjana Wijeyetilleke, Mr. Jayasuriya said.
Symbolically I will go there but if Mohan Peiris attends the function I will have to walk out. Likewise several senior Presidents Counsel have informed the Bar that they would do so, Mr. Jayasuirya said.
Mr. Jayasuriya said he had conveyed the decision to the AG and in turn the AG had conveyed about its decision to the CJ indicating that he should not come there. The BASL has repeatedly urged CJ Peiris to resign from his position and stated it has lost confidence in the credibility of the CJ to continue to function in that position. (Susitha R. Fernando)

Northern Expressway suspended
	
	Review underway to know real cost
	The government has decided to suspend the execution of the northern expressway project initiated by the previous regime, till its cost effectiveness is fully checked, a minister said yesterday.
	 
	Before the presidential election, then President Mahinda Rajapaksa ceremonially launched the project which was to be carried out under a loan agreement with China. The highway was due to link Colombo with Kandy via Kurunegala, and then Dambulla.
	The new Finance Minister, Ravi Karunanayake, said though such ceremonies were conducted to inaugurate the project, nothing had actually been done on the ground with regard to its implementation.
	The Minister told Daily Mirror that costs appeared to have been inflated in most development projects, either executed or in the pipeline, and therefore it would be better to have a full-scale review to ascertain the cost in real terms. The cost has been estimated with corruption added on. We have to reduce root out corruption for more development work to be carried out with the funds available. The estimated cost is double the size of the actual cost in certain cases, he said. 
	Besides, the Minister said the new government had decided to stop payments for various dubious transactions committed during the previous regime. 
	For instance, he said, 770 double cabs had been imported to the country during the last week of December purported to be used in election related work. We will sell these vehicles to the public now. Likewise, over 1800 vehicles were lying at the Presidential Secretariat. As a policy, we decided to use these vehicles for our duty related work without importing new ones, he said.

Therefore, the promise given to the people should be fulfilled, he told journalists after visiting patients at the Army Hospital in Narahenpita
	Meanwhile, he said if DP Parliament Member Jayantha Ketagoda who crossed over to the United Peoples Freedom Alliance (UPFA) resigned, the vacant seat should be given to the DP.
	Mr. Ketagoda had not informed me about any decision to resign from parliament. However, the seat belongs to our party. We will have to adhere to election regulations on appointing a DP member be it me or someone else, Mr. Fonseka said.
	He said his service to the people will continue whether he was appointed an MP or not. Mr. Fonseka said he took two years and nine months to defeat terrorism while it took only two years and eight months to defeat the previous regime.
	I vowed to topple the previous regime by 2015 upon my release from prison in 2012. We have achieved that today. The promises given to the people will be kept and the soldiers will no longer have to carry out duties outside of their curricula, he assured the soldiers. (Darshana Sanjeewa)

Blanket amnesty for money repatriated from Swiss Banks: FinMin
	
The government extended an olive branch to all Sri Lankan nationals, allowing them to repatriate all foreign investments with no questions asked.
Please bring back your money to Sri Lanka. We wont ask any questions and we will guarantee safety. We have already instructed the Exchange Control Department, the Central Bank and the commercial banks, Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake said today.
He said that the government took the decision after the Union Bank of Switzerland downgraded Sri Lanka and two other countries and ordered the closure of all accounts of these countries in its banking system.
If the Swiss are asking you to leave, bring them here instead of taking them to Dubai or Singapore. You can put them in a current account, or invest in bonds, the stock market, or put them in savings, Karunanayake said.
He added that the Sri Lankan Diaspora alone had foreign investments of US$10-15 billion, and the government expects US$2-3 billion in inflows in the next 6 months.
We already have the confidence of the world with the outcomes in Geneva and New York. So place your confidence in us. Youre getting zero percent interest there. Come and get 3-4 percent interest here, he said.
He went on to say that this would be the solution to the low local savings which is stifling local investments.
Instead of paying foreigners interest on bonds, we want local funds, he said. Nearly 50 percent of the countrys debt is from foreign sources.
Karunanayake expressed that this would be the first step in creating a financial hub in Sri Lanka, and said that Indians too will be requested to bring their savings here, capitalizing on the close working relationship between the Prime Ministers of the two countries.
He added that success from this exercise would strengthen the rupee. The rupee has fallen 7 percent
against the dollar this year after the Central Bank decided to stop intervention to maintain foreign reserves.
Karunanayake was unable to comment on the current strength of foreign reserves.
We are not desperate. If we are desperate, we can take more drastic measures, he said.

In an effort to protect children through digital technology, the Telecom and Digital Infrastructure Ministry is seeking a relaxation of the current regulations barring students from taking mobile phones to school.
The ministry said it would pave the way for the introduction of a special mobile phone device to protect them.
Telecom and Digital Infrastructure Minister Harin Fernando told a media briefing that this system would be in place by next week.
He said recent rape and killing of the little girl at Kotadeniyawa, the killing of a 10-year- old boy in Athurugiriya and several other crimes against children had influenced the ministry to introduce this new devise.
Explaining about this system, the minister said a child will be given a personnel mobile phone through which he or she could dial his or her parents' numbers or dial the police emergency.
The phone will not have other facilities such as games or internet with the service providers being in a position to control the network.
We know there will be shortcomings and loopholes in the system. These will be rectified in time to come. What is important is to get started at some point or the other, he said and assured that the shortcomings would be addressed as soon as possible.
The devise will be launched by two main mobile phone service providers Mobitel and Dialog which will introduce another innovative system named I card which is a tracking devise where a parent will have a track of their children.
Meanwhile plans are afoot to appoint an inter-ministerial committee to prepare a national cyber policy especially aimed at fighting cyber crime.WATCH

National Freedom Front (NFF) leader Wimal Weerawansa today challenged the government to prove that the unanimously adopted UNHRC resolution did not contain a proposal for the setting up of a hybrid court as claimed by the government.
He said it was a big lie to describe the proposed investigative process as a domestic mechanism because the resolution clearly mentioned that foreign experts comprising investigators and judges would be involved in this mechanism.
Even though the word hybrid has been removed in the adopted resolution, the mechanism proposed remains the same. Participation of foreign experts including investigators and judges has clearly been mentioned in the resolution. It is better to describe it as a foreign judiciary than to say a domestic mechanism, Mr. Weerawansa said.
He said the foreign experts were expected to arrive in the country to question the heads of the security forces and to punish those who were responsible for giving orders.
Mr. Weerawansa said the government had prevented the media from revealing the truth behind this investigation process and was influencing the media heads to project it as a domestic mechanism.
We ask Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe not to mislead the people by hiding the truth. He should apologize to the people for telling lies. If they are not afraid of this, why are they trying to hide it, he asked.
Mr. Weerawansa said they would not allow the government to conceal this huge betrayal despite its attempts to do so.(Ajith Siriwardana)WATCH

Domestic mechanism in accordance with Constitution-President
	
President Maithripala Sirisena said his government's policy is to have a domestic mechanism in accordance with the country's Constitution to look in to human rights allegations.
Making a special statement the President also said an all party conference would soon be convened along with all religious leaders to discuss finding solutions to the resolution on Sri Lanka, that was adopted at the UNHRC session in Geneva a few days ago.
Soon after arriving home after a hectic but successful tour in the US to address the 70th UN General Assembly, President Sirisena told the media at Presidents House last afternoon that the government faced the UNHRC boldly and was able to remove the proposal to conduct an international probe by a hybrid court that would ultimately take the perpetrators if found guilty to the electric chair.
We did not achieve this under any pressure, stress or arm twisting. We told the global community in no uncertain terms that an international probe was unacceptable to us. We also told them that we were ready for a domestic probe within the constitutional framework of Sri Lanka. There will be no orders, no decrees in this exercise from any one. Therefore, Sri Lanka now can face the challenges and charges against her in a positive and optimistic frame of mind, President Sirisena stressed.
However, President Sirisena maintained that the objective of the global community was to stabilize Human Rights, Fundamental Rights, Rule of Law and Democracy in Sri Lanka.
In this endeavour of domestic probe under International standards, the government was ready and keen to obtain the help, consultation and goodwill of all concerned and would closely study the UNHRC report, the Nissanka Udalagama Report, Sir Desmond De Silva Report, the LLRC report and the Armed Force Reports that carry information pertaining to alleged war crimes. The UN Human Rights Council had compiled reports on war crimes in other countries and it had taken more than 20 to 30 years to complete such probes and for remedial and punitive actions. But Sri Lanka would not take such a long time to bring this entire process to a positive and satisfactory conclusion, he emphasized.
He said the indigenous mechanism that would be set up on the International standard and guidelines would definitely give the opportunity to all accused if any including ex-LTTE cadres to prove their innocence before such court or panel.
President Sirisena said a special legal panel would be appointed to go through the alleged violation of the International Human Rights Law, Fundamental Rights and War Crimes and also to make recommendations on how those issues could be addressed in accordance with the law of the land.
As the President of the country, I look at all these developments in an unbiased and impartial manner. There is no doubt that there will be many a problem when we put these measures into practise. If and when we find obstacles to take the programme forward we will consult the UN General Secretary for consultation and further action. Whatever action we take, they must not be a hindrance or affect the people of the country negatively. The government is fully resolved to protect peace, reconciliation and ethnic harmony as it is the government policy, he added.
He said the National Unity Government headed by him and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe was fully committed to promote peace, reconciliation, inter-communal harmony as it was the declared policy of the government and added not only the people in the North-East but those in the South who were affected and harmed during the ethnic conflict would be compensated, resettled and returned the lands to their rightful owners.
President Sirisena pointed out that the governments resolve and objective was to take all possible action to prevent a repetition of past mistakes.
All these were possible as a result of the January 8 regime change that brought him to power and the formation of the National Unity Government on August 17. The government has scored a major victory following his address at the 70th UN General Assembly and new approach taken in Geneva at the 30th UNHRC sessions.
All great leaders in the past who have waged wars have become great rulers with compassion, love and humility after realizing the merits and demerits of war. That was how Chandashoka in India became Dharmashoka and spread Buddhism and friendship in Asia and in Sri Lanka in particular.
In our war, Sri Lanka obtained help against separatist terrorism from many friendly nations like US, Britain, India, China and Pakistan. Interestingly, it was some of these cou8ntries who brought war crime charges against us after the war. When Sri Lanka failed to respond to these allegations positively and in a pragmatic manner, the Tamil Diaspora took the issue into their own hands and agitated for action against Sri Lanka. We must not forget that though the separatist terrorism was physically defeated in May, 2009, the ideology and the concept of the Tamil Eelam had not been defeated. That was why the Global agitation against Sri Lanka was able to withdraw the GSP+ facility from Sri Lanka and fish exports to the EU.
When I, try hard to save the country from this predicament, my opponents brand me a Stooge of the America. But I will prove them that they are wrong and it was I and my government that saved them from the electric chair and the country from the international blacklist of war crimes, he said.
President Sirisena said the Mahinda Rajapaksa government antagonized Sri Lankas friends by humiliating them. Once, foreign dignitaries were summoned down South and boasted that they were sent back by making them to eat Maniocs. Then again there were pseudo fasting before the UN office in Colombo that distanced Sri Lanka from the UN member countries and made them think about Sri Lanka in a negative manner.
However, this government has been able to retrieve Sri Lanka from this predicament and restore its good name and turn our those who acted against us our friends. they are keen to help Sri Lanka's progress and see Sri Lanka become a country that uphold reconciliation, Reparation, Rule of Law, Human Rights and Fundamental Rights.
President Sirisena paid a special tribute to Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, Foreign Affairs Minister Mangala Samaraweera and the Cabinet of Ministers for their unstinted support to restore Sri Lanka's good name among the global community and save Sri Lanka from a so called international war crimes probe.Pix by Pradeep Dilrukshana

The government will soon start a dialogue to change people's lifestyles which might include changing school hours, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said on Thursday.
Speaking during the annual academic sessions of Endocrine Society of Sri Lanka, he said a national dialogue on changing the lifestyle of the people was essential to prevent diseases such as diabetes which he pointed out was spreading rapidly in Sri Lanka.
"The spread of the disease among the schoolchildren is becoming a great worry," the Prime Minister said.
He said some have suggested that changing of school hours was necessary to change the lifestyle of schoolchildren to prevent diseases such as diabetes.
The Prime Minister asked whether changing school hours was enough to change the situation. He said one needs to keep a watch on the growing urbanization which changes lifestyles.
Urbanization has made people go to fast food outlets instead of eating a wholesome meal cooked at home like the way we did during out school days and this situation too should be noted," he said and added that a public dialogue was necessary to address all these issues before coming up with solutions.

The loan-to-value ratio on vehicle imports has been increased to 90 per cent from Monday, October 5 from the earlier 70 per cent, Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake said today.
Too many vehicles are on the roads and were being criticised, but its an individual freedom, the minister said.
The artificially created low-interest regime had allowed financial companies to provide 100 per cent lease financing on motor vehicle imports until the Central Bank intervened in September.
The minister said customers must deposit 90% of the value of the vehicle in a non-interest bearing and non-refundable account when opening a letter of credit so as to prevent excessive ad-hoc buying which usually takes place before a budget. (Chandeepa Wettasinghe)

Police requested public assistance to identify the girl who was attacked so that they could investigate the incident.
Police Spokesman Ruwan Gunasekarra told Daily Mirror that at the moment police does not have any information about the incident or the identity of the girl and therefore they are unable not initiate an investigation.

Probe mechanism must be domestic: President
	
President Maithripala Sirisena has told the New York Times on Wednesday that he would keep an open mind on a war crime tribunal and make sure it was in keeping with Sri Lankas Constitution.
In an interview with the newspaper in New York, the President had said the mechanism to probe war crime charges must be domestic. Excerpts of the article
Mr. Sirisena, over tea at his hotel in Midtown Manhattan on Wednesday afternoon, said the court would be established after what he called careful consultations with religious leaders, politicians and military officials.
Setting up a war crimes tribunal, involving foreigners no less, is a highly delicate matter. It follows a report by the United Nations, which concluded that both sides had likely committed war crimes and that an independent judicial process involving foreign judges was needed, with the United Nations high commissioner for human rights, Zeid Raad al-Hussein, saying bluntly that Sri Lanka is not currently equipped to conduct an independent and credible investigation.
The report described extrajudicial killings and disappearances, and gave accounts of torture and sexual violence. (Sri Lanka is not a party to the International Criminal Court.)
I took over a country isolated by the international community, Mr. Sirisena said, after a marathon set of speeches and meetings. The main challenge I faced was to win over the international community. I believe these efforts have borne fruit.
Asked for evidence, his ambassador to the United States, Prasad Kariyawasam, jumped in to say that the president had been offered a seat at the head table at lunch with Secretary General Ban Ki-moon, along with Mr. Obama and President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia. Mr. Sirisena said his offer of assistance in peacekeeping efforts had been welcomed.
Mr. Sirisena promised to help with more soldiers, including Special Forces units and experts on clearing unexploded ordnance. It put the onus on the United Nations system to carefully vet those soldiers, and roles they might have played in Sri Lankas own war.
Mr. Sirisenas challenges are significant, both politically and legally. He was elected in January, defeating the incumbent, Mahinda Rajapakse, with a promise to heal the wounds from the civil war.
In the interview on Wednesday, Mr. Sirisena was unwilling to commit himself to any particular judicial mechanism, saying he would keep an open mind and make sure it was in keeping with Sri Lankas Constitution.
Sri Lanka does not allow foreign lawyers to practice in its courts, an aide to the president said later, and it was not possible for the country to set up a new international court without amending the Constitution, which would be extremely difficult politically.
The mechanism must be domestic, Mr. Sirisena said. In a measure of the lingering distrust, Kasippilai Manoharan, the father of one of five students killed by security forces on a beach near the port of Trincomalee in 2006, said he was skeptical of any judicial process that was not truly international. I trust the international community and the Human Rights Council, but Ill never trust Sri Lankan courts, he said in an interview.

Russia finally blitzes ISIS
	
At least 12 Islamic State fanatics have been killed in Russia's first air strikes on the extremist faction's main Syrian bastion.
Russia's defence ministry said it struck an ISIS training camp near the village of Maadan Jadid, 45 miles east of Raqqa city and 'a camouflaged command post at Kasrat Faraj' southwest of the city.
It came as ISIS militants posted a tweet warning 'Death to Putin: We are coming #soon' with a picture of Moscow's St Basil's Cathedral in flames, according to the SITE intelligence group.
Meanwhile, Russian President Vladimir Putin arrived for talks with his French counterpart Francois Hollande in Paris as questions mount over who Moscow was targeting in Syria. (Daily Mail - UK)

Tragic phenomenon of  forcible recruitment  of Tamil civilians by the LTTE
	
By D.B.S. JeyarajThe Human Rights Investigation report on Sri Lanka compiled by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights released last month has revealed much information about the alleged activities of the Sri Lankan armed forces, the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) and state affiliated para  military outfits such as the Eelam Peoples Democratic Party(EPDP) and Tamil Makkal Viduthalaip Puligal(TMVP) during the final phase of South Asias longest war. While overseas members of the LTTE demonstrate in Geneva with tiger flags and portraits of LTTE supremo Veluppillai Prabhakaran, those who read the UN report are appalled and horrified by the acts of cruelty perpetrated by the LTTE on its own people. Among the many aspects focused upon by the UN investigation  report on Sri Lanka - abbreviated as OISL report  is the tragic phenomenon of forcible recruitment of Tamil civilians by the LTTE.
In earlier times the LTTE had not engaged in the exercise of forcible recruitment or conscription. It was in fact organizations such as the Eelam Peoples Revolutionary Liberation Front(EPRLF) and Eelam National Democratic Liberation Front(ENDLF) who pioneered forcible recruitment during the days of the Indian army deployment in the Northern and Eastern provinces of Sri Lanka.The LTTE campaign of forced recruitment on a massive scale began in June 2006 and  accelerated from October onwards. One of the factors contributing to this was the split caused in the LTTE by the revolt of its former eastern regional commander.
The LTTE breakaway faction led by former tiger eastern region commander Vinayagamoorthy Muraleetharan alias Col Karuna was actively engaged in child conscription and forced recruitment in the East after his defection. Security forces were allegedly complicit in this campaign undertaken by the Karuna faction known as the Tamil Makkal Viduthalai Puligal (TMVP). The Eastern Province thus became the focus of attention in the sphere of abductions, conscription and forced recruitment in those days.
Apart from the TMVP involvement and complicity by the security forces the mainstream LTTE was also engaged in abductions and conscriptions. The Eastern province saw much activity in this regard after the split in the LTTE in 2004. Thousands of cadres who dropped out or escaped from the LTTE after the split were targetted again by both parties. Also both the LTTE and TMVP began abducting and forcibly recruiting new persons into their respective organizations. Some instances were reported in the media .
While the focus was on the volatile east, the actions of the LTTE in the north did not receive the same glare of publicity. Lack of access to the LTTE dominated regions in the Northern mainland was the chief contributory factor to this state of affairs then. The unwillingness of many Tamil people to publicly articulate their grievances against the LTTE was another reason for the situation. The Tamil community grapevine was humming with tales of tiger abductions but few Tamils were willing to come forward and say so openly.Fear of repercussionsThe main reason was fear of repercussions at the hands of the LTTE and its minions. Another reason was the feeling that the Tamil cause would be weakened if accusations were levelled against the LTTE. Family members of those conscripted were also afraid to speak out because the lives of those abducted may have been in jeopardy. Families were explicitly warned of such consequences if details of abductions leaked out.
Besides many families concerned were also residing in LTTE controlled areas and themselves were in danger.The prevailing totalitarian control of society by the LTTE prevented people speaking out except for communicating their distress to trusted persons. All these reasons helped the LTTE to get away with continual abductions and forcible recruitments in those years.
The scale and intensity of forcible recruitments increased in 2006 as the fighting escalated. It was always the LTTE position that the movement faced a shortage of personnel because enough people were not volunteering. If enough numbers were forthcoming the elusive goal of Tamil Eelam would be a reality they used to say then.There was also much talk of a massive counter  strike against the armed forces by the LTTE. Additional cadres were necessary for this it was argued by the LTTE then.
While the military priorities and objectives were given pride of place the human dimension was once again lost sight of by the LTTE . The sad irony was that the war was being supposedly fought for the liberation and upliftment of the Tamil people! What was happening however was that of the position of the Tamil civilians worsening day by day.
The LTTE may have wanted more and more people to join up and fight but the ordinary Tamils were in no mood to oblige. They simply wanted to be left alone to pick up the pieces of their fractured lives and get on with living. This war was not their war any more. The tigers may have celebrated death but the ordinary Tamil people wanted life no matter how miserable it may have been under prevailing conditions.They did not want their children to die as cannon fodder in what was clearly an unwinnable war.. Which parent would want thatCivilian arms training
The LTTE had earlier started the process of civilian arms training. All able bodied persons from 16 to 45 were required to undergo some physical training and learn techniques of self  defence. Those willing to go the extra  mile were given more intensive training and forged into an auxiliary outfit known as Ellai Padai or border force. They functioned mainly as helpers to the LTTE cadres in border areas.Another category of persons was selected out of the original batches of trainees and given further training. They were supposedly reservists and called Makkal Padai or peoples force.These people were allowed to get on with normal civilian life but were required to show up whenever necessary or required. Most members of these civilian militias were not willing to fight or die. But they had no choice and were reluctantly compelled to go along with tiger diktat.
These enlistment practices were overshadowed by a new direct campaign of forced recruitment that began in 2006. The intensification and acceleration of the LTTE campaign to forcibly recruit Tamil civilians directly into their ranks caused much resentment amid the Tamil people then. However they had no way to resist or protest. Some went into hiding. Others found ways to leave or escape from those areas. Those detected while trying to escape were punished. The LTTE also infiltrated the Govt controlled areas of Mannar , Vavuniya and even Jaffna districts and abducted people. However the full force of tiger conscriptions was faced by the people of Kilinochchi and Mullaitheevu districts.
	
	
The LTTE which was running a parallel administration then  set up its monitoring apparatus in the areas it controlled. There were two or more LTTE operatives functioning as grama sevakhas in each village. They were in possession of all family details in every household in their areas of authority. LTTE operatives armed with such particulars visited each home and press ganged the reluctant young men and women into joining them. If unsuccessful at day  time the tigers returned at night. Nocturnal raids were a regular feature.
All students in the Advanced level classes were compelled to undergo training in self  defence and first  aid. The training period was between two to four weeks.The bright ones were identified and brainwashed or forcibly recruited as permanent cadres. Initially the families of fallen tigers or great heroes and serving LTTE members were exempted. Later they too were targeted.Many of the parents stopped sending children to schools. Young people seldom moved around publicly. If they were seen the chances of being taken away were very high. Some parents avoided going out to work and stayed home under the impression that they could prevent their children being taken.Pathetic predicament
An incident in Kilinochchi  illustrates the pathetic predicament of ordinary people then. A family of five in Aanandapuram in Kilinochchi was killed in bombing by the Air Force. Two of those killed were boys aged 18 and 20 respectively. The boys were kept at home to avoid being conscripted by the LTTE at school. Tragically Yaman came for them at home via an Israeli K- fir. Students of that particular school were afraid to attend classes because the principal of that institution was allegedly helping the LTTE to identify and abduct students. The principal who was a close relative of a top tiger commander is today holding high political office as an elected representative of the people.
One way of avoiding conscription was to resort to matrimony since married persons were not forcibly recruited when the conscription campaign commenced. So many people in tiger controlled areas began marrying early. With the recruitment drive being launched in June 2006 the rate of marriages shot up among young people. The LTTE then declared that all marriages after August 2006 were null and void. Regardless of marital status the new grooms and brides were conscripted. The LTTE also went to the extent of declaring a moratorium on marriages till a particular age was reached. Males could not marry till they were 40 and females till 35 was the new commandment. This was only a temporary measure assured the LTTE then.
An  incident of suicide that occurred then was pathetic. On January 22nd 2007 a schoolmaster from Uruthirapuram married an employee at the Mallavi hospital. Both were in their mid  twenties. Two days later on the 24th, LTTE operatives came to the newly married couple and insisted that the groom give up marital bliss and join up with them. The wedding was not valid they pointed out because the legal marriage ages were 40 and 35. The distressed couple pleaded with the tigers and obtained a few days grace to complete wedding rituals .The tigers agreed and went away.
The groom and bride escaped and hid themselves elsewhere. The tigers returned and were infuriated at this defiance. They abducted the grooms sister and the brides brother and took them away. The groom was asked to present himself within a week. Otherwise the siblings would not return, warned  LTTE.The groom was extremely agitated and worried. After pondering the situation for days in a frustrated and confused mental state the man committed suicide by hanging on February 5th 2007. He died exactly two weeks after his marriage.
This woeful tale was talked about widely in the LTTE areas and elsewhere .Many people were highly critical of the LTTE for this act which encapsuled the predicament faced by ordinary Tamils under the jackboots of the LTTE. In a bid to counter this resentment the LTTE put a counter spin by spreading the rumour that the man was diagnosed with terminal cancer and therefore had taken his own life .Detained and punished
The LTTE also banned the movement of people to Govt controlled areas. People were allowed out only for specific reasons on a very strict basis. In most instances someone living in the Wanni had to stand surety. If the person who exited did not return on time the person who stood surety would be detained and punished. The LTTE was very strict in disallowing juniors between 12 and 17 from leaving the Wanni in those days.
The people particularly the mothers resisted as much as they could. But most efforts were futile. Some of the stories related about those dark days are pathetic. One mother fell on the ground in front of a tiger vehicle in a desperate attempt to block it from driving away with her son. The LTTE driver callously drove over the womans leg crushing the bone. In another incident the frantic mother tried to cling on to her son but was pushed away roughly. She fell down and hit her forehead on a stone. Seeing the wife bleed the elderly husband/ father got angry and slapped the tiger cadre. The tigers were enraged.Engalukku Kai Neetta thuninjitiyo (Are you brave enough to raise your hand against us) they shouted. Thereafter the old man was given a merciless thrashing and was hospitalised.
In one case the 21-year-old brother was given permission to go to Colombo to welcome an uncle who was visiting from abroad. His family guaranteed his return in three months. While he was in Colombo the LTTE recruitment drive escalated. Family members urged the son not to return but stay in Colombo and try to go abroad. When the LTTE went to the house the family said that the young man was sick and needed medical treatment in Colombo.
The tigers took away the 16-year-old sister and said she would be released if proof of the brothers medical condition was furnished. The brother got himself admitted to a private hospital and after some doctoring with some sympathetic help by those concerned sent the necessary paperwork to convince the LTTE of his medical condition. The LTTE rejected the documents and wanted the family to give them medical records from a Govt hospital!. The sister was under tiger custody for many months and finally co- opted into LTTE ranks.She was killed in the fighting.
The LTTE slogan for recruitment was Veetukku Oru Veeran Allathu Veeranganai ( One hero or heroine from each house). The tigers began strictly enforcing this . All households were forced to send one member. If those eligible escaped or avoided being recruited another was taken away as hostage. Those protesting or objecting were assaulted severely. Some were detained for indefinite periods.Face consequences
Some of the persons taken by the tigers managed to escape and went into hiding. The LTTE sent letters to the families saying the escapees must surrender themselves before a particular date. Otherwise family members would have to face consequences the tigers warned.In another incident on Feb 9th 2007 in Vattakachchi an elder sister was taken in place of a younger sister who went into hiding. The protesting parents were kicked and pushed aside.
An LTTE member had absconded from the tigers after being sent to Vavuniya to do political work after the ceasefire. He came to Colombo and then went abroad. This was in 2003. After making inquiries from the family the LTTE did not do anything. But in 2006 the LTTE came to the house and wanted the escapee to return to the LTTE again. When told that he was now abroad the tigers took away his younger sister aged 15. The family was told that the girl would be sent home if the brother returned to the Country and the movement.
Some people sent their children or even moved out of the LTTE controlled areas through circuitous jungle routes. There was much hardship and danger but people risked it rather than see children being conscripted. The LTTEs elite leopard commano unit also prowled these jungle routes keeping up vigil. While some people managed to escape many were caught and punished.One family had twin sons in their twenties. The LTTE wanted one to join up. The family tried to escape through a jungle route and was caught. As punishment both sons were taken away.
One particularly sad incident was about a young girl in Puthukudiyiruppu. She was the only daughter in the family and very clever in studies. Her elder brothers had either died as LTTE Maaveerar or gone abroad. The family was however worried because the girl did not attain age for many years. Finally she became a periya pillai  (loku lamaya) at the age of 18. The parents were so happy that they had a comparatively grand celebration on the day of pouring water. (thanni vaarkum naal). Two days later the tigers came and took her away leaving the parents devastated.Fences devoured crops
Some families from Allaipiddy and Mankumban had relocated to the Wanni after the spate of killings by the Navy and EPDP in May 2006. They felt the LTTE controlled Wanni was safer than their own villages. In 2007 some youngsters from these displaced families went missing. Family members rushed to the LTTE Kaavalthurai (Police) run by Nadesan. The Eelam cops promised to inquire into the matter. It was only some days later that enlightenment dawned on the families that the fences had devoured the crops.Among those taken away by the LTTE were some girl students staying with Catholic sisters at a nunnery and attending a convent. The tigers took those over 17 years of age forcibly. Church leaders appealed to the LTTE hierarchy but did not publicise the incident for obvious reasons.The LTTE also abducted young persons in the government controlled areas of Mannar, Vavuniya and even Jaffna. Age or marital status was not a bar when it came to abducting those in Govt controlled areas. They were taken to LTTE controlled areas clandestinely and forcibly inducted as tiger cadres. It was alleged then that most incidents of youths abducted in Jaffna during daytime and then going missing were perpetrated by the LTTE. As the conflict intensified the use of mobile phones by members of the public was banned by the LTTE in the Wanni. Anyone found using one was penalised.All foreign calls could be taken only from LTTE run communication centres. The numbers had to be registered in the mornings. The calls limited to 5 minutes per call were allowed in the evenings. The time in between is used by the LTTE to verify details about those being called.
There were however many who managed to come out of the Wanni in that period. This was mainly due to nepotism and/or corruption. High ranking tiger leaders who had sent their own children abroad for higher studies were known to have intervened in some instances and ensured the sending away of close relatives. In other cases massive donations were paid officially to the LTTE and unofficially to tiger officials for people to get away. The sad irony was that some of these escapees were treated as LTTE suspects when they came to the Govt controlled areas.Grim gloomy scenario
This then was the grim, gloomy scenario that unfolded in the LTTE dominated north during the days of war. The so-called liberators of the Tamil people were intensely recruiting people forcibly to be conscripted into tiger ranks. The rationale being, manpower requirement was necessary to continue the Por (war). All oppression was justified as being necessitated by the Tamil cause.
Ordinary Tamil civilians however wanted no part of this war being fought in their name. They only wanted to be left alone so that they could get along with their life. Sadly that was being denied to them. That was the Tamil tragedy!
After some more years of terrible suffering the war was finally over in May 2009!D.B.S.Jeyaraj can be reached at dbsjeyaraj@yahoo.com

Modi may visit SL in March
	
	NEW DELHI: With a new government taking office in Sri Lanka, Prime Minister Narendra Modi may travel to Colombo in March. If he does go, it will be the first state visit by an Indian PM since Rajiv Gandhi's trip in 1987.
	Speaking to journalists after his first visit in his new capacity, Sri Lanka's new foreign minister Mangala Samaraweera said, "The new government wanted to demonstrate importance of restoring friendly ties with our neighbour." Samaraweera said external affairs minister Sushma Swaraj would travel to Sri Lanka for the joint commission meeting in February. This would be followed by the first visit to India by new Sri Lankan President Maithripala Sirisena.
	Describing the regime change in Sri Lanka as its "own version of the Arab Spring", Samaraweera said the transition was not as easy as it might appear. The images of Mahinda Rajapaksa waving goodbye to his staff at his official residence was greeted with relief that the departing strongman had accepted the people's verdict.
	Samaraweera said Rajapaksa was attempting to conduct a "coup" by imposing an emergency. "But our armed forces stood by us," he said adding a full inquiry would be conducted into the events of that night.
	The foreign minister promised to revisit the mammoth port city projects by China. This assurance was given by new Prime Minister Ranil Wickremasinghe too.
	He also promised a domestic investigation and inquiry into alleged human rights violations in the last months of the war against the LTTE in 2009. The Rajapaksa government had several run-ins with the UN Human Rights Council on this issue. Samaraweera said their government was leaning towards having a domestic mechanism with international support, something that India would be happy to endorse.
	The Sirisena government, the foreign minister said, intended to abolish the executive presidency, by essentially repealing the 18th amendment. On the 13th amendment though he was a lot more careful. He said they would return land to Tamils as well take a slew of other steps, which he said would not need the 13th amendment.
	All the parties in the coalition would have a forum under the leadership of Chandrika Kumaratunga, tentatively called the National Executive Council. (Times of India)

13A subjected to Unitary Character
	
	Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, in his first parliamentary address after assuming office in the new administration headed by President Maithripala Sirisena -- said the Government would preserve the unitary character of the Constitution when introducing constitutional reforms.
	He outlined the plan for the execution of the 100-day programme and said the Government would introduce the 19th Amendment to the Constitution for the establishment of independent commissions which were rendered worthless under the 18th Amendment.
	The Prime Minister said fresh constitutional reforms would be enacted to transfer the executive powers to the Legislature and the Cabinet during this period.
	"We will introduce these reforms while preserving the unitary character of the Constitution. The 13th Amendment to the Constitution will be implemented subject to that principle," he said.
	He said the stage had been set for a novel political culture and his government intended to engage in consensus politics rather than adopting a confrontational approach in achieving the targets set out in the 100-day programme in the greater interest of the country.
	The Prime Minister said the country was engulfed in political and economic issues and grappling with challenges on the international front and added that the government would overcome all these challenges. He said the Government would enact the National Audit Bill, Right to Information Bill and the legislation for the implementation of the National Medicinal Drugs Policy.
	"We now have a new political culture in which the main political parties have cast aside their policies and ideological differences to achieve common goals. This is a novel experience for the entire region. We will tread this path in consultation with all stakeholders," he said. (Kelum Bandara and Yohan Perera)

Desperate Lankans to consult expert on Malinga recovery
	
	Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) Executive Committee has approved a suggestion by Chief National Selector Sanath Jayasuriya to get an opinion on Lasith Malinga from world renowned Australian doctor of Sri Lankan origin Professor Siri Kannangara.
	Key bowler Malinga who underwent an ankle surgery in September last year was expected to complete his recuperation within 16 weeks and be available for the final two matches of the current seven-match ODI series against New Zealand.
	However, Jayasuriya said that Malingas recovery has been slower than expected and he had to be ruled out of the series against New Zealand.
	Yesterday, Jayasuriya told the stunned SLC ex-co member that the star bowlers recovery in time for the World Cup starting on February 14 now looked very slim.
	It is very unlikely that he would be able to play in the World Cup Jayasuriya said.
	Malinga was operated on by famous Australian surgeon Dr. David Young. Jayasuriya told  that he was keen to have the opinion of Professor Kannangara too after learning about the Sydney based doctors reputation, and claimed Sri Lanka was getting desperate as they were fast running out of options.
	I was told that he is an ankle specialist. So, lets hope the good doctor would be able to pull off some miracle, said Jayasuriya.
	Kannangara is Professor of Medicine at the University of Sydney and has functioned as a Physician and Consultant to the Australian Olympic teams at the Barcelona, Atlanta and Sydney Games, and at World Cup events for football, cricket, net ball and hockey. Prof. Kannangara is also the Director of the New South Wales Institute of Sports Medicine and he served in the FIFA Medical Committee from 1999 to 2006.
	Interestingly, before undergoing surgery, Malinga himself suggested that Sri Lanka should groom a successor for him at the World Cup.
	I will do everything I can to be back for the World Cup, but I think it would be good for us to give a young bowler a few opportunities in the meantime, so that we can at least have someone prepared, Malinga had told media in September.
	Sri Lankas fiercest weapon for more than a decade, Malinga will be sorely missed by Sri Lanka on the fast and bouncy tracks in Australia and New Zealand, if he is unable to make it.
	Meanwhile, young paceman Dushmantha Chameera has been dispatched to New Zealand to fill Malingas void.
	Sources told Daily Mirror that captain Angelo Mathews and other senior players had requested national selectors to send experienced paceman Dilhara Fernando as the replacement, but selectors had turned down the request.

Dinesh asks Ravi to apologise to country
	
	Mahajana Eksath Peramuna (MEP) leader Dinesh Gunawardane said yesterday Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake should apologise to the country for making a false statement about a bank account maintained by former Defence Secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa
	Mr. Gunawardane told Parliament that the media had been manipulated under the new Government to spread falsehoods against the leaders of the previous Government.
	He said there was a sinister media campaign about a coup hatched at Temple Trees on the day after elections.
	"It is total fiction. I know the Prime Minister is aware of what happened. Therefore, I am asking the Government not to load people with false news. It does not help the good governance that you proposed," Mr. Gunawardene said.
	Referring to the news item about a floating armoury in the sea off Galle, he said it was part of maritime security arrangements to protect the transnational ships and other naval activities to prevent sea piracy.
	"This security arrangement has been recognised by the United Nation. Yet, the Government twists news stories. They are playing with the media. I kindly request you to allow the media to engage in impartial and accurate reporting rather than loading them with falsehoods," he said.
	Mr. Gunawardene said nobody could forget the fact that it was former President Mahinda Rajapaksa who defeated separatist terrorism in this country.
	"We all know Defence Secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa played a pivotal role in this effort. Today, there are accusations against him about running a bank account with a balance of eight billion rupees. This news has been vehemently denied even by the new Defence Secretary," he said.(Kelum Bandara and Yohan Perera)

	Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said yesterday that Sri Lanka was not a party to the Rome Statute and therefore all matters should be determined by domestic jurisdiction but that the new Government would engage with the UN Human Rights Council and the concerned members in a positive manner so that an understanding could be reached on outstanding issues on human rights.
	The Prime Minister expressed these views at a conference of Asias Attorneys General held at the BMICH to mark the 130th anniversary of the Sri Lanka Attorney Generals Department.
	President Mathripala Sirisena was the Chief Guest while Attorney General Y.J.W. Vijayatilake presided over the inaugural session which was attended by Justice Minister Wijedasa Rajapakshe, Senior Supreme Court Judge K. Sripavan and Solicitor General Bimba Tillekeratne.
	The following is the statement made by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe:
	I know the pressure under which the Attorney Generals Department functions. But somehow the rule of law is upheld. It has not been tampered with completely. Let the people of Sri Lanka get the democratic systems back. We have already drafted the 19th Amendment to for the restoration of the Independent Commissions and the power of the judiciary. We are in the process of bringing to Parliament the Witness Protection Bill, the Right to Information Bill and the National Audit Bill. The Minister of Justice is entrusted with this task. It is just the beginning of good governance, the Parliamentary Committees, the establishment of the Public Finance Committee and the enforcing of parliamentary control over the executive.
	The basic concept of the rule of law is damaged and the rule of law was set aside during the war. Even after the war, it continued. We must ensure the principle of the rule of law. When terrorism is ended, the rule of law must be restored. The law cant be silent even after the war.
	The Army Commander who defeated the LTTE was brought to Court overnight as a traitor. Then the Chief Justice was removed from her post. There are many other instances of people being victimised.
	Somehow the rule of law was upheld. Sri Lankans want the democratic systems back. The President and the Government will implement the 19th Amendment and restore the independent commissions.
	It is very important to ensure that Sri Lanka upholds the rule of law in Asia. We will also ensure the sectional protocol of the ICC. People believe that the rule of law has been tampered with. The rule of law also is in danger of disappearing. We have to ensure that the rule of law which is the oldest legal system has to be restored. the Prime Minister said. (S.S.

Sri Lankan successfully completes IATA Environmental Assessment
	
	Taking forward t he green legacy of the national carrier, SriLankan has successfully completed the International Air Transport Associations Environment Assessment (IEnvA) Program Stage 01 Assessment.Sri Lankan has completed the first of two stages of assessments alongside some other prominent international carriers including, Icelandair and Qatar Airways. South African Airways and Finnair have also recently completed the second and final assessments stage of the IEnvAProgram.
Sri Lankan Air lines Head of Human Resources and the Convenor of the Green Team, Pradeepa Kekulawala said, As the national carrier of Sri Lanka, that has been promoting the countys natural beauty worldwide, we have been fully aware of our responsibility towards environment; this has driven us to involve ourselves in sustainable practices thereby contributing to conservation. The Green Team of SriLankan Airlines has been i mplementing many projects on carbon mitigation and waste management. We are proud that SriLankan Airlines has completed the IEnvA stage 1 Assessment, which goes to show our dedication towards environment as an airline, and the passengers who fly with us can take pride in the fact that they become contributors to conservation through their choice of airline.
These airlines are among the pioneers in this critical new program. IATAs audits and assessment schemes are impartial, independent evaluations designed to improve industry performance against global benchmarks. The IATA Operational Safety Audit has done much to help improve airline safety and we expect that the IEnvA will do likewise for environmental standards said Tony Tyler, IATAs Director-General and CEO.
IEnvA has been developed in conjunction with airlines so that it addresses industry needs and specific concerns. IEnvA assesses environmental performance against sustainability standards across a broad range of disciplines, including (but not limited to) the management of air quality and emissions, noise, fuel consumption and operational efficiency, recycling, energy efficiency, sustainable procurement, and biofuel utilization. Further this evaluation system is designed to independently assess and improve the environmental management of an airline and as a voluntary programme IEnvA helps airlines to simplify regulatory compliance, demonstrate good governance and achieve financial savings from the better use of resources.
SriLankan Airlines, Environmental Compliance and Planning Manager, Dhanushka de Silva said, This is a proud moment for SriLankan Airlines when the Airlines Environment Strategic and Compliance unit achieves a great milestone in terms of environmental standards and regulatory compliances. This signifies our team effort and commitment to organise and structure our operational processes according to the International environmental standards.
IEnvA implementation follows a phased approach due t o t he complexity and global presence of airlines. This involves a detailed assessment of flight operations, corporate and management activities.The two implementation phases are:Stage 01 ensures an airline has developed t he foundation and framework for its environmental management system. Stage 1 also certifies an airline has identified and complied with its environmental legal requirements.Stage 02 is the highest level of IEnvA achievement, ensures that an airline has implemented all of the IEnvA Program Standards, identified and mitigated its significant environmental impacts and has set performance targets. Stage 2 also certifies that an airline has developed processes for monitoring and reviewing its performance against its targets and objectives, thus driving environmental efficiency.
SriLankans Green Vision is focussed on becoming South Asias pioneering Planet-Friendly Airline and to achieve sustainable business development. The Airline continues to take on many sustainable projects focussing on reducing carbon footprint and conserving nature with the help of passionate volunteers and partnerships.

Port City Project: Chinese company supports SL review
	
	Amid various allegations and moves to stop the Colombo Port City Project, the China Communications. Construction Company Limited (CCCC), which is the project proponent, said yesterday it would extend its fullest cooperation to the Sri Lankan Government and the relevant authorities.
	The CCCC said it would provide all necessary information according to relevant regulations for the purpose of assessing and reviewing the Project.
	The Colombo Port City Project was undertaken after several initiatives and attempts by different prospective project proponents, to develop a waterfront property in the City of Colombo.
	The first attempt was made by the Singaporean company CESMA in 1998 on an initiative of the Singaporean Government to study the 'Colombo Metropolitan Regional Structure Plan. The final plan published on 2004, developed by the Sri Lankan and Singaporean team, proposed a Western Region Megapolis by 2030. However, the concept plans could not be implemented due to the vast cost in building the breakwater in deep water to protect the reclaimed land. The Port City became financially feasible only when the breakwater was integrated with the Colombo Port Expansion Project.
	Ranked 187th in 2014 among the Fortune Five Hundred companies in the world, CCCC as a responsible corporate, reiterates that all necessary procedures were followed in the initiation of the project.
	
	CCCC has sought the expertise of internationally reputed development consultancy firms such as AECOM (Americas premier fully integrated infrastructure and support services firm), ATKINS (Globally recognized UK based design engineering and project management consultancy), SWECO (Nordic regions leading consulting engineering company in sustainable engineering and design), JLL (US & Indias Professional Services and Investment Management Company specializing in real estate services), Pinsent Masons (UK) and PWC (US).
	Further, prior to CCCC undertaking the development of the project in 2010 an initial Technical Feasibility Study and Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) of the Project was performed by the University of Moratuwa, under the directive of the Sri Lanka Ports Authority. The Technical Feasibility Study was subsequently approved by the Sri Lankan Government and the Environmental Impact Assessment was published for the public benefit.
	Once public inquiries were answered, the Environmental Impact Assessment was approved by government-approved agencies.
	Additionally, an Environmental Management Plan (EMP) was submitted by CCCC and approved after monitoring the projects environmental and coastal impact, as per the requirements of the Environmental Impact Assessment. 
	The total duration of the process from submitting the proposal to signing the agreement, extended to four years, to make sure that all procedures of the Governments procurement regulations were followed.
	CCCC is committed to support the Sri Lankan Governments vision of making the country a gateway to South Asia.
	Spanning 233 hectares, the Colombo Port City is currently the single largest private-sector development project in Sri Lankas long, rich and storied history. The Colombo Port City will add strong economic pillars to the countrys existing development plans to make it a viable investment destination in South Asia. 
	The project aims to create 83,000 new employment opportunities within different sectors, attract US$$13 billion in foreign investments from investors and developers across the region like India, Singapore, Malaysia and China and increase the number of tourists visiting the country during the next 30 years.
	CCCC, as a responsible corporate citizen, is fully committed to fulfilling its enterprise responsibilities through due diligence, help develop the countrys economy and communities, share common interests and goals, and contribute to the sustainable growth of the country.

Video: JVP urges CJ to resign
	
Questioning his appointment and his conduct during the night of presidential election, the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) today urged Chief Justice (CJ) Mohan Peiris to step down from his post.
JVP Leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake told a media briefing about questions over the process which led to the present Chief Justices appointment and the removal of the former Chief Justice Shirani Bandaranaike from the post.
He said there was no motion to impeach Dr. Bandaranaiake from the post of Chief Justice in the Parliament order book and that the motion was only to examine her conduct and in such a scenario the appointment of the present CJ raises several questions.
Mr. Dissanayake asked why the CJ was present at Temple Trees on January 8 and had a private discussion with the former President because it was the practice for CJ to meet the president only publicly to discuss matters of public importance.
He said his party would take steps to remove him in keeping with provisions provided by the constitution in such instances if the CJ refuses to resign.
Mr. Dissanayake said the alleged coup on election night should be probed and the perpetrators brought to book and added that his party had proposed to the National Executive Committee that a senior police officer be appointed to probe this alleged coup and the report submitted to the council within a week.

New high end appointments trigger a furor
	
	Certain high end appointments made since the compassionate regime taking office has triggered a roaring furor in government circles.
Those unhappy over these appointments have complained to the Compassionate One that the names of some of the appointees figure prominently in the Black Book opened by the UDF stalwarts at the height of the recent hustings with a view to bringing to justice high public officials who resorted to corrupt practices to ensure a third term for the former Big Boss.
Among the big guns kicking up a row over the new appointments is former Madam, a co-architect of the alliance that brought the compassionate rule to power. She has expressed her displeasure in no uncertain terms at the appointment of a onetime crony of the former Big Boss as the Media Secretary overlooking the credentials of the lady who handled their media job in the run-up to the poll.
Meanwhile, the deposed General reportedly flew into a rage on hearing that another lackey of the previous regime was installed in the highest chair of a state-owned media institution.
However, the Compassionate One has said in response to the protests and complaints against the new appointments that he would not be able to run the administration if he started sacking one by one all the public officials who carried out illegal orders of their former political bosses. Given this stand taken up by the Compassionate One, all indications are that all new high end appointees including his own secretary and the Defense secretary will survive their new positions at least until a new Parliament is elected following the 100- day interim rule.

Video: Gammanpila says coup allegations a joke
	
Pivithuru Hela Urumaya (PHU) General Secretary Udaya Gammanpila said today that allegations that a coup had been planned by former Defense Secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa, G. L. Peiris and himself on the night of the presidential election were totally false and claimed that all that had taken place on that night was a discussion about whether it would be necessary to impose a curfew to prevent violence in the country following the defeat of the SLFP.
Mr. Gammanpila, speaking to the media soon after making a statement to the CID regarding the allegation of his involvement in an alleged coup on the night following the presidential election that took place at Temple Trees, said that more than one hundred people were present during a discussion which took place in the presence of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa and that discussions centred around whether curfew should be imposed on January 9 in order to maintain a peaceful atmosphere in the country ahead of the visit of Pope Francis.
Those who attended the meeting included former Minister G.L. Peiris, Central Bank Governor Ajith Navard Cabraal, Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa, the police chief, the commanders of the three forces, the Attorney General and the Secretary of the Law and Order Ministry Mahinda Balasuriya, he stated.
We were told that UNP supporters had attempted to assault one of our Provincial Councillors, Samanmalee Sakalasuriya, at a counting centre and there had been some reports of possible poll violations in Colombo. So we discussed about the possibility of imposing a curfew to maintain law and order so that there would be no hindrance to the arrival of the Pope he said.
But, Mr. Gammanpila added that former president Mahinda Rajapaksa was of the opinion that the opposition would get the wrong impression if this was done and he had instructed the IGP to take the necessary steps to control the situation after holding discussions with the new President and Prime Minister. He had also instructed Presidential Secretary Lalith Weerathunga to organise the oath taking ceremony of the new president, Mr. Gammanpila said.
Mr. Gammanpila said that the claim that he had been part of an alleged coup was baseless as such a coup never existed. I told the CID everything I knew. I was present at Temple Trees from 2.30 am to 6.30 am on January 9 and a coup was never discussed during that time, he said adding that if such an uprising did take place it would be the first attempted legal coup in the world with knowledge of the Attorney General.
It is a big joke to think that Professor G.L. Peiris and I, who had never even used a catapult, had been part of a coup, he said. (Ajith Siriwardana)

	The unending stream of well-wishers calling on the Compassionate One ever since being elevated to the highest office has become a big headache to him.
Most of these well-wishers are really seasoned political lackeys who have been used to tasting power and perks under different regimes.
The other day two siblings who had once been very close to the deposed Big Boss called on the Compassionate One. They had earlier made known their intention to extend their unstinted support to the compassionate rule by way of setting the stage for this visit. Incidentally the two siblings are closely connected to media and cinema.
Pleasantries over, the Compassionate One inquired by way of common courtesy from the twosome whether there was any specific purpose for their visit. One of the siblings replied: Sir, we wish to do something worthwhile for your government in some official capacity.
The Compassionate One asked them what positions they wished to hold under his administration. One sibling said that he could serve on the directorate of a state-owned bank and the other said he could acquit well on an important commission.
Why should I offer you high office the Compassionate One asked. Are you seeking a reward for slinging mud at me through that website launched by that fellow to destroy my political career Do you think that I was not aware of what you two were doing behind the scene The door is there. Now get out! And they left without a murmur.

	A group of bigwigs of the previous regime loyal to the former Boss met to discuss the future of their alliance.
Several ex-Ministers who were articulate at this powwow took up the position that the party would quickly bounce back to its previous position of strength, if the deposed Boss took over the leadership again. Some agreed and some others acquiesced. Later they called on the former Boss to convey their decision.
The former Big Boss, sadder but wiser, gave an attentive ear to what his loyalists had to say. And while the discussion was on, he was also carefully observing the demeanour of each member of the group as if to find a clue to their inner thinking. Later, the former Big Boss told his visitors that he would come back to them after carefully considering their invitation.
Discussion over, the loyalists began leaving one by one. However, a few ex-Ministers remained as if they had some afterthoughts to share with the Boss. After exchanging a few minutes of small talk with the stragglers, the deposed Big Boss said: Did you observe that one was studying the patterns on the floor without making any comment during the entire discussion Was it not obvious that he did not welcome my entering the council to lead the opposition He added after a pause. You make him happy by offering this important office to him and leave me out of the scene!
So the one who once led the government side is now due to lead the opposition!

Homagama Magistrate R.B.Nelumdeniya granted leave to the CID to photograph the Girithale Army Intelligence Corps Camp, where journalist Prageeth Ekneligoda had been allegedly detained, and to examine the books and documents maintained by the camp authorities.
The magistrate also ordered the Army Commander to provide all necessary facilities to the CID officers and also to detail Military Police officers to provide security for them.
The CID informed Court that investigations had been initiated following a complaint by Ekneligoda's wife Sandya Ekneligoda, and that consequent upon the investigations, two lieutenant colonels and several intelligence officers had been detained and were being interrogated.
CID submitted to Court a further report on the progress of the investigations.
Attorney Dilipa Pieris, who appeared on behalf of the complainant said that it has been revealed that kidnapped journalist Prageeth Ekneligoda had been detained in the Girithale Intelligence Corps Camp, and sought the Court's permission to examine the relevant sections of the camp and also to photograph them.
Attorney Peiris further said the intelligence officers had tape recorded a discussion in which Ekneligoda had taken part on 27 August, 2009 on a land in Sigiriya belonging to Ekneligoda; and that the recording had been sent the Director of Intelligence on the following day. He sought Court's permission to produce the said recording plus the documents sent to the Director of Intelligence and also the mobile phone numbers of the intelligence officers concerned.
The other documents needed for the investigations are the movement register maintained at the main gate to record the arrival and departure of officers who leave the camp premises, the book in which permission to go more than 20 kilometres from the camp is recorded. The attorney sought a court order to obtain these records as they were needed for their investigations.
After considering the submissions of the CID, the magistrate granted permission for ASP Shani Abeysekere and other officers of the CID to visit the Girithale Intelligence Corps Camp and conduct the necessary investigations.

Gaddafi put his arm on my shoulder-MR
	
Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa today denied claims that he had antagonised the Western nations by being photographed with his arm around late Muammar Gaddafi of Libya.
It is actually Gaddafi who has his arm on my shoulder in that much publicised photograph, the former President said issuing a two-page statement.
He also said that It was also said that when foreign dignitaries came to Sri Lanka to persuade Sri Lanka to stop the war.  I had deliberately insulted them by taking them to Embilipitiya and giving them manioc to eat, and that that resentment was motivating the Western countries to pass resolutions against us. I have no recollection what was on the menu when the British and French foreign ministers met me in the final days of the war demanding that I halt hostilities.
But it is certainly true that I refused point blank to halt the war. It is because I did not buckle under foreign pressure that this country is free of terrorism today. Governments are elected by the people of Sri Lanka to do what is best for the country and not to agree to everything said by foreign powers. That applies to the resolution that has just been passed in Geneva as well.Full statementGovt.s duty is to stand by our war heroes
Though the passage of the US sponsored resolution against Sri Lanka in the UNHRC without a vote last Thursday is being hailed as a diplomatic victory for Sri Lanka, I am unable to share that view. Operative paragraph 6 of the resolution affirms the importance of the participation of foreign judges, prosecutors, lawyers and investigators in the Sri Lankan judicial mechanism to be set up to investigate alleged human rights abuses during the war.
Operative paragraph 8 encourages the Sri Lankan government to remove individuals in the armed forces suspected of human rights violations through an administrative vetting process even if there is insufficient evidence to charge them in a court of law. Operative paragraph 4 welcomes the governments willingness to allow the various judicial and other mechanisms it intends to establish to deal with the past, to obtain financial assistance from overseas, which means that these supposedly Sri Lankan mechanisms will be paid for and maintained by foreign powers.
Those are just a few of the objectionable operative paragraphs in that resolution. After its passage, the Prime Minister said that Sri Lanka has now been taken off the agenda in the UNHRC. Posters of the UPFA have appeared on the streets hailing the government for delivering the country from the imperialist death trap in Geneva. Such statements sit oddly beside the operative paragraphs of the resolution mentioned above.
The mismatch between the provisions of the resolution that was passed and the governments present mixed signals and rhetoric may be due to a belated realisation that nothing has been gained by Sri Lanka joining the USA as a co-sponsor of this resolution except to commit the government to a course of action which runs contrary to the interests of this country and is therefore politically unfeasible. I acknowledge that there are times when foreign powers try to foist their way of thinking upon other nations and the country at the receiving end has to find ways of dealing with the situation.
The first duty of the Sri Lankan government is to see to it that the interests of our war heroes are looked after. Operative paragraphs 6 & 8 of the resolution run directly contrary to that sacred duty. I regret to note that there is an attempt to whitewash the unfavourable resolution in Geneva by claiming that this was the best that could be achieved and that things could have been far worse with the near certainty of economic sanctions if my government had been still in power.
The withdrawal of the GSP+ trade concession in 2010 and the ban on Sri Lankan fish imports to the EU in January 2015 were mentioned as the forerunners of the sanctions that were to be imposed on Sri Lanka. The public should be made aware that the ban on fish imports to the EU this year was due to issues relating to illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing in the Indian Ocean in contravention of the rules of the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission and had nothing at all to do with politics or human rights.
As for GSP+, this is a special trade concession of doubtful utility which gives the EU a political handle over the recipient country. In 2010 when GSP+ came up for its quinquennial review and this was being used to impose the EUs will on Sri Lanka, my government made a conscious decision not to reapply for GSP+. Even after this trade concession was withdrawn, my government ensured that apparel exports to the EU kept growing at more than 6% a year. It should be noted that no major exporting country in Asia has applied for GSP+ due to the political strings attached to it.
It was also said that I had antagonised the Western nations by being photographed with my arm around Muammar Gaddafi of Libya. It is actually Gaddafi who has his arm on my shoulder in that much publicised photograph. In the last months of the war in 2009 when Sri Lanka was fast losing foreign reserves due to the severe global economic recession that year and the IMF under pressure from the Western nations was delaying the standby facility that we were entitled to, Muammar Gaddafi agreed to lend 500 million USD to Sri Lanka in response to a single phone call from me. If not for that pledge, the economy would have collapsed before the war could be won.
It was also said that when foreign dignitaries came to Sri Lanka to persuade us to stop the war, I had deliberately insulted them by taking them to Embilipitiya and giving them manioc to eat, and that that resentment was motivating the Western countries to pass resolutions against us. I have no recollection what was on the menu when the British and French foreign ministers met me in the final days of the war demanding that I halt hostilities. But it is certainly true that I refused point blank to halt the war. It is because I did not buckle under foreign pressure that this country is free of terrorism today.
Governments are elected by the people of Sri Lanka to do what is best for the country and not to agree to everything said by foreign powers. That applies to the resolution that has just been passed in Geneva as well.

Resolution has unacceptable clauses: JVP
	
	Several proposals of the UNHRC resolution on Sri Lanka cannot be accepted as it poses some dangers to the country, the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) said today.
	JVP General Secretary Tilvin Silva told a news briefing that several proposals of the resolutions including the one which says an international probe would have to be conducted if Sri Lanka fails to carryout an acceptable domestic probe on the alleged violations of human rights and the clause that assistance of Commonwealth and other international bodies should be sought in the proposed domestic probe cannot be accepted.
	Further, he said the resolution could be a tactic by the Western Countries and USA to interfere in Sri Lanka in the future. In such circumstances, he said The Government cannot say the country had made a great achievement but should take things seriously, he said.
	The JVP General Secretary said the previous regime is also greatly responsible for this situation.
	Accordingly, Mr. Silva said a domestic inquiry should be conducted without involving any international organisation while the government should act according to the mandate it had got. Also he said redress should be provided to all those who have been distressed during the war.
	At the same time the JVP General Secretary welcomed the establishment of a truth commission stating it is something which his party suggested back in 2009 just after the completion of the war. Government had remembered to set up a truth commission only after USA and the UNHRC requested but turned a deaf ear when our party suggested it, he said. (Yohan Perera)

Coup allegations are baseless: Gota
	
	Former Defense Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa rejected allegations of an attempt being made by the Rajapaksa regime to subvert democracy through an election night coup and said they would not have called in the Attorney General if such a plan was being actually hatched at Temple Trees.
	Yes, the Attorney General was called to Temple Trees but that was to discuss the matter of maintaining law and order such as whether it was necessary to impose a curfew, etc. because the Opposition had publicly stated that it will surround Temple Trees. That was a situation that needed to be addressed, he said in an interview with Daily Mirror.
	Mr. Rajapaksa said therefore there was a need to put in place certain measures and provide instructions on the maintenance of law and order during the post-election period.
	He said the AG, the IGP and the service commanders were present at the Temple Trees.
	The AG is entitled to advise the government and if there was an attempt to stage a coup, do you think the AG would have been consulted Mr. Rajapaksa asked adding that these allegations about a coup was false and baseless and was being publicized to discredit the former President and other officials.
	Its nothing more than a political witch-hunt because its very clear that no such thing took place; even before all the results were announced the President and all his staff left Temple Trees, he added. (Lakna Paranamanna)

	This regime promised to slash taxes during the elections but had failed to do so, he said while recalling that the taxes on fuel were under heavy criticism by those who were in office today.
	Mr. Weerrawansa said the fuel price reduction was a result of a temporary situation in the world.
	Therefore, he said, global fuel prices reduction was a result of a tactic followed by the USA to keep price low in order to pressurize Russia.
	He said it was difficult to predict as to how long the global fuel prices stand low in such a situation.
	Meanwhile, he also criticized the calls for the resignation of Chief Justice Mohan Peiris.
	He said there were certain legal formalities to remove him.
	One could bring in a motion to Parliament seeking the impeachment of the Chief Justice if he is not fit to hold the post, he said.
	Weeawansa said the present government had failed to keep its promise to keep the Cabinet to 25 members by appointing 29 Cabinet Ministers, 11 State ministers and 13 Deputy Ministers.
	He questioned the statement made by the Minister of Foreign Affairs Mangala Samaraweera who had said that the North would be demilitarized.

The country also is tops  or has been No. 1  in searches for sex, camel sex, rape video, child sex video and some other searches that cant be mentioned.
Google found that of the top 10 countries  searching for sex-related sites  six were Muslim, with Pakistan on the top. The other Muslim countries are Egypt at number 2, Iran at 4, Morocco at 5, Saudi Arabia at 7 and Turkey at 8. Non-Muslim states are Vietnam at 3, India at 6, Philippines at 9 and Poland at 10.
Cairo was the #1 city that searched for sex on Google. Arabic is the 2nd most common language that is used to search for gay sex. Its the number one language for search involving sexy.

AIA presents tuk tuk wisdom on bridging gap
	
		 		 
		 
			
Tuk Tuks, are a common feature in many of the 18 markets across Asia in which AIA, Asias life insurer, operates.
Often the bane of many a vehicle drivers, these whizzing wheelers are a sure relief to pedestrians looking for a fast way through the traffic.
While it is a typically Asia phenomenon, surely youd agree that Sri Lankan tuk tuks boast a unique characteristic. Thanks to them you know that who flies high, falls not low, only one sun shines for all and you should win without boasting, lose without excuse. Not to forget that life is not a game, (so) dont play it!
Famed for their cryptically profound slogans, these tuk tuks elicit a reaction from and leave a lasting impression on all of us. Be it a tribute to 2pac, solidarity with Bob Marley or a reminder that Che Guevara wants you to rebel.tuks tuks are a common slate for social messaging and instigation.
While the (often erroneously spelled) English slogans take on a more ideological and advisory stance, reminding you that too much of anything is good for nothing, Sinhala scripts, known as tuk tuk wadan tend to be a more crude and realistic commentary on some hard social facts. For example, hitapu kaelith na, athe sathe na, thaththa neththan mekath na! This articulates a common Sri Lankan phenomenon, that of young adults beings dependent on their parents, with no apparent financial security for the future.
Another common phrase is jeevithe mal, amma inna kal! Again, this highlights the prevalent problem of youth not thinking about let alone planning for their future, but instead being complacent with the provisions from their parents. Of course, if you read into the rhetoric a little deeper, you may see it as a wakeup call to realize that in fact, your parents wont be around forever and it will serve you well to start planning for your future. Yet another sardonic saying ko puthe yaluwo Ada salli ne amme, emphasizes that monetary security plays a pivotal social role.
While these quotes are often steeped in satire and cynicism, it does provide sound insights into social concerns and how much emphasis is placed on financial security. More importantly, it conveys the importance of bridging the gap, between what you have and what you will need, by pointing out the reality that life could lose its zest if youre not financially secure.
So the next time you see a scurrying tuk tuk darting across the road, have a good look and see what prudent messaging it may have. Who knows, you may just learn something new! And if you like to take it a step further and want to know more about financially securing the future for yourself and your family, then call us on 2310310, and wed behappy to help.

Click4Life has boosted customer value: Asian Alliance COO
	
		 		 
		 
			
Boosted by a high standard of customer service and retention, operational efficiency and technological innovation, Asian Alliance Life Insurance has been experiencing strong growth, far above the industry norm.
Rising up to the challenge of ensuring that high customer service standards are maintained and costs are managed prudently in this high-growth scenario, Asian Alliance Insurance has opted for further technological innovation that streamlines processes, enhances customer convenience and benefits all key stakeholders with the inclusion of its latest innovation  Click4Life.
In this interview, Asian Alliance Insurance  Life Chief Operating Officer (COO), Chula Hettiarachchi, elaborates on how technological innovation  at the point of interacting
with the customer, as well as in back-office processes 
have equipped the company to offer a superior service to its customers while simultaneously increasing
operational efficiency.
How has Asian Alliance Insurance performed financially in life insurance and how does this performance compare with that of the industry
The growth momentum of Asian Alliance in life insurance in the recent past has consistently exceeded that of the local life insurance industry. For instance, considering specifically the first half (1H) of the 2015 financial year, Asian Alliance performed exceptionally well.
Our Life Gross Written Premium (GWP) grew 31 percent year-on-year (YoY), while Life GWP growth of the industry was only 14 percent YoY in the same period  indicating that we are growing at double the industry average. We recorded significant improvements in both the top-line and the bottom-line. In addition to its obligations to clients and employees, Asian Alliance, as a publicly quoted company, has consistently met its obligations to its investors in providing a good return. In managing our fast-growing client portfolios, cost management has become a vital element  and we have addressed this through technological innovation.
The IT-based approach in all key areas of operations has ensured that costs have grown at a significantly lower rate in comparison with the growth in revenue. The expense ratio, which is an important indicator in this regard has been consistently on a downward trend and is below the industry average.
How has technological innovation directly benefited Asian Alliances life policyholders
We operate in the top market segment, catering to an elite customer base and our average customer value currently is Rs. 90,000  which is four times that of the industry. Thus the customers have high expectations and expect a very high service standard. We have met this need largely by offering greater customer convenience and value addition through technological innovation.
For the first time in the local insurance industry, our Click4Life application gave life policyholders direct access to conveniently fulfil many of their requirements through a PC/mobile app without manual intervention.
The services available via the app include convenient payment of premiums at any time, intimation of hospitalization claims, accessing personal information and changing policy details when required. This can also be used by policyholders to obtain a range of information on their policies  including the type of the policy, terms, payment mode, commencement date and benefits  and to request for various documents such as tax letters, surrender value certificates, embassy letters, premium summaries, payment history and bonus summaries.
A large number of our customers are already using this app and in the near future we will use it as a service rating mechanism as well, thus enabling us to monitor and further enhance customer satisfaction.
Similarly, our Click2Pay application, which has been provided to our Insurance Advisors for premium collections, enables customers to receive acknowledgement of their premium payments within a very short time period and thus increases transparency as well. From an operational viewpoint, this also enhances speed and accuracy while reducing the possibility of misappropriation etc. and is thus beneficial to the company.
Further, we were the countrys first to introduce self-service insurance kiosks, through which life policyholders can conveniently fulfil many needs.
What are the companys other innovations in back-office processes relating to life insurance and how have they enhanced operational efficiency
We have already introduced Optimal Character Recognition (OCR), which enables computers to directly capture hand-written data in various customer documents, thus eliminating the need for manual data entry and making the process of issuing a policy considerably faster and more accurate. This has enabled us to issue 50 percent of our life policies within a day.
Developing even further on this idea, we will shortly enable customers to fill out forms on tablet devices, enabling data to be directly captured and stored, thus further enhancing the speed and accuracy of the process.
We also have in place a computerized workflow system with live dashboard monitoring system that can monitor the status of each and every new application/proposal, revival, alteration or claim and enable staff to be monitored for higher performance and efficiency.
In addition to technological innovation, what other measures being taken to add value to life policyholders of Asian Alliance
We have launched a massive Customer Relationship Management (CRM) programme to reward our policyholders. For the first time in the countrys life insurance industry each-and-every policyholder will be rewarded under this initiative.
At present, in the local life insurance industry, the customer only has a relationship with his/her Insurance Advisor and if this person leaves the company etc. the policy will often lapse. Within the first three years, 80% of life policies in Sri Lanka lapse, which is a serious issue as these customers will not get their money back and they also do not have insurance cover. While Asian Alliance has a far superior record  with a retention rate of 80 percent in the first year in life insurance  our new CRM programme would further strengthen our relationship with our customers by putting seven departments in charge of interacting with different tiers of customers.
Asian Alliance Insurance PLC is held by Softlogic Capital PLC and is part of the Softlogic Group, which is recognized as one of Sri Lankas most diversified and fastest-growing conglomerates with interests in Healthcare, Retail, ICT, Leisure, Automobiles and Financial Services. Significant stakeholders in the company also include FMO and DEG that are rated AAA Development Financial Institutions from the Netherlands and Germany respectively.

Janashakthi hosts risk management seminar for hospitality industry
	
In a bid to share expertise and promote cross-cultural learning, Janashakthi General Insurance recently hosted Managing Your Risks Better, a seminar on risk management in the hotel industry. Several members of the hospitality industry attended the seminar held at Cinnamon Lakeside.
The seminar worked to give participants a holistic understanding of the risks involved in the hospitality industry, with several experts in varying fields giving informative talks on the topic. Sri Lanka is increasingly being promoted as a tourist destination. Not many people think of the risks involved in the tourist industry. Thats why we as a responsible insurer want to educate industry representatives of the risks, so that they can be prepared for any eventuality, Janashakthi General Insurance Limited Chief Executive Officer Jude Fernando said speaking at the event. Janashakthi General Insurance Limited General Manager Insurance Shani Ranasinghe opened proceedings, giving participants an introduction into the common misconceptions made when making an insurance claim by hoteliers.
Providing international perspective, McLarens Global Claims Services Singapore Regional Loss Adjuster Simon Stacey spoke about his experience during devastating floods in Northern and Central Thailand in 2011. In a wide-ranging and informative talk, Stacey provided insights on the role of a loss adjuster when evaluating a wide variety of claims  from stock to machinery and fixtures and fittings.
He also provided intensive information on making claims for business interruption, a topic of great relevance to those in the hospitality industry in the event of a natural catastrophe. In this way, participants learned the best way to prepare at the time of purchasing an insurance
policy and what steps needed to be taken to ensure a smooth claimspayment process.
Disaster Management Centre Sri Lanka Director Mitigation, Research and Development Anoja Senevirathne also spoke at the seminar on how to reduce risks and hazards associated with a natural disaster. Providing detailed statistics, Senevirathne explained that the fallout from a natural disaster event such as a
flood or tsunami would impact the private sector as well as the public sector causing more damage and huge losses.
In this sense, the private sector too had a part to play in minimizing its own exposure to risk, she said. As such, members of the hospitality industry should conduct detailed contingency management plans incorporating disaster risk reduction measures so that they could minimize their own losses. Transferring risk via purchasing an insurance policy should be done in a meaningful way particularly considering the spatial distribution of disaster risk,
she added.

Japan a sincere friend of SL: Abe
	
	Japan will act as a sincere friend of Sri Lanka during challenging times the latter may have to go through, Japanese Prime minister Shinz Abe said yesterday.
	The Japanse Prime Minister made this point when he met his Sri Lankan counterpart Ranil Wickremesinghe prior to the 12th Science and Technology Summit in Kyoto last morning.
	Mr. Abe was confident that the bilateral ties between the two countries would further develop under the new Sri Lankan administration and that Sri Lanka would become a trade and economic hub in Asia in time to come.
	He recalled that the bilateral ties were originally developed after a speech made by late President J. R. Jayewardene made on Japan at San Francisco in 1952. He said the Japansese people will never forget this speech.
	Mr. Wickremesighe in his reply thanked his Japansese counterpart and said Japan will play a major role in building global relationship in the next decade. He appreciated the hand given by Japan in the fields of education and development of technology. He said government to government and private sector to private sector relationships should be developed between the two countries.
	Meanwhile, Mr. Wickremesinghe who addressed the science and technology summit said the current Sri Lankan government is committed to meet out justice to those who were distressed.
	Also he said Japan which had accepted that war is not a means of overcoming international crisis and become a global leader through the development of science and technology. Asia needs such leaders, he said.
	Stating that innovation should be a basis of development, the Prime Minister said many countries in South Asia had not been able to reap the benefit of such innovation. Mr. Wickremesinghe therefore stressed the need for a joint science and technological initiative between Japan and South Asia. (Dinith Chinthaka Karunaratne in Japan)

Vehicle import levies to be applied after Budget: Ravi
	
The import duty rates on vehicles, to be imposed in this years Budget, would be applied to all the vehicles that reach Sri Lankan shores after the budget was produced, Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake said today.
He said many people had criticized last year that they were not informed beforehand when the previous government imposed taxes on imported vehicles.
We decided to make this announcement as we were subjected to heavy criticism last year. We didnt ask anyone not to send any vehicles to Sri Lanka till the budget is presented, he said.
The government increased import duties on some categories of vehicles and the new rates were changed from the vehicles that arrived in the Sri Lanka ports after the budget date in early 2015 and the new rates were charged even though the vehicles were sent prior to the Budget. (Yohan Perera)
