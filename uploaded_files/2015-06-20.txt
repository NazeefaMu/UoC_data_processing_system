While lauding Sri Lanka?s effort to building a nation where diversity, openness and tolerance are cherished, Japanese Foreign Affairs Minister Fumio Kishida reiterated the continued support of Japanese Government to the ongoing process of peace and reconciliation in Sri Lanka.

LTTE sympathizers, financial network still intact: US
	
Despite the military defeat of the LTTE at the hands of the Sri Lankan government in 2009, the terrorist organisation?s international network of sympathizers and financial support continues, US Department of State said yesterday.
Quoting the Country Reports on Terrorism released by the US Counterterrorism Bureau, the Department said LTTE?s financial network of support had continued to operate throughout 2014.
?LTTE used its international contacts and the large Tamil diaspora in North America, Europe, and Asia to procure weapons, communications, funding, and other needed supplies.? The group employed charities as fronts to collect and divert funds for its activities,? the report said.
It said that there have been no known attacks in Sri Lanka that could verifiably be attributed to the LTTE since the end of the war, but a total of 13 LTTE supporters, several of which had allegedly planned attacks against U.S. and Israeli diplomatic facilities in India, were arrested in Malaysia in 2014.

Meters to be made mandatory for all 3-wheelers
	
Electronic taxi meters will be made mandatory for all three-wheelers soon, and steps will be taken to ensure that all meters are maintained at a proper standard.
An official of the the Measurement Units Standards and Services Department (MUSSD) told Daily Mirror yesterday that regulations to verify the accuracy of taxi meters would be introduced after the proposed gazette notification making meters mandatory for three-wheelers.
However trade union action by three-wheeler operators may stall efforts to make meters mandatory, Daily Mirror learns.
MUSSD Acting Director K. Premasiri Kumara said none of the meters being used currently had been approved by them because they lacked the the technical ability to verify the accuracy of meters.
?There are several kinds of electronic meters used by drivers and some of them can be adjusted. So some drivers cheat the public by overcharging them. We want all meters to be brought to one standard," Mr. Kumara said.
He said the MUSSD had got two new taxi-meter testing machines, and these would be used to measure the accuracy of taxi meters after being subject to some tests themselves.
Mr. Kumara said the testing programme had commenced earlier, but had come to standstill due to a lack of funds. (Piyumi Fonseka)
