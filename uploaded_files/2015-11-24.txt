They say it?s a deal that stinks
	
A certain political authority is said to be hell-bent on clearing the way for launching a mega hotel project on a CTB depot property on the outskirts of the city.?
During the previous regime a leading corporate body had sought to acquire a part of this land to site a multi-storey hotel complex. However, the proposed deal fell through as the political authority in charge of Transport at that time insisted that the Ministry be given a stake in the company on a par with the estimated value of the land to be acquired for the project.?
The new political authority has not stipulated such a condition this time round. In fact, he has already presented a paper to the highest decision-making body proposing the alienation of the land in question for the proposed hotel project.?
The eagle-eyed trade union activists who are highly concerned about the proposed deal say that they can smell its stink from a mile away!

UnionPay offers tips to boost holiday sales
	
Derek Chang, Head of South Asia of UnionPay International
According to the Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority, Chinese tourists are the fastest growing group with over 164,000 visiting the island in the first nine months of this year, which represents a 73.6% increase. ?To attract this emerging group of tourists, more and more businesses have started accepting UnionPay as a payment method.
With the holiday season fast approaching, many businesses, especially in the tourism sector, are getting ready for the busiest time of the year. ?To help businesses further boost their sales, Derek Chang, Head of South Asia of UnionPay International, offers 3 practical tips below:
Offer unique holiday deals: ?Do not try to be the same as your competitors. ?Consider running special promotions to attract your target group of tourists to come and spend in this holiday season. With limited time and resources, many hotels and restaurants have already started focusing their energy in marketing to specific tourist segments, such as offering special discount for UnionPay Cardholders, to maximize their return on marketing investments. ?
Communicate clearly: ?Communication is the key to marketing success. Including their native languages in key promotional messages would not just ensure tourists understand your service or product offerings; but also create a stronger incentive to buy. ?Not sure which languages to include? ? Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority periodically releases statistics and is a good starting point for finding out which are the emerging group of inbound tourists.
Think like a tourist: While tourists often pay by cash, many would pay by their preferred debit or credit cards. According to the survey conducted by the international research company - AC Nielsen, UnionPay has a remarkable 100% brand recognition rate in the Chinese Mainland. ?Businesses that address preference of their target customers are likely to capture more sales opportunities and satisfied customers tend to give higher ratings in their online reviews.

A politico behind illegal paddy land filling operation
	
Filling of some paddy lands lying beside the High Level road in an urban area not far away from the City is the talk of the people in the locality, they say.
The lowland area, coming under this hectic filling operation proceeding apace, is about 14 acres in extent.
As filling of paddies is known to be an illegal activity, some inquisitive ones had made inquiries and found that a secretarial one is directing this operation on behalf of a powerful politician.
The politician in question has ordered the agrarian services authority concerned to issue an official letter certifying that the parcels of lowland now being filled are not paddies and this has placed the official in a terrible dilemma, they say.
Meanwhile, two real estate companies are reportedly busy with preliminaries for breaking up the spreads being filled into commercial lots.?

Case booked against SL navy
	
	The Marine Police of the Coastal Security Group (CSG) have registered a case against the Sri Lankan navy for allegedly attacking fishermen from Rameswaram on November 21, when they were fishing on the high seas, north off Rameswaram fishing jetty.
	A complaint was filed by Rameswaram fisherman A. Varghis, who suffered head injury in the incident. The Sri Lankan navy allegedly attacked the fishermen with iron balls, stones and bottles.
	Mandapam Marine police registered a case against the Sri Lankan navy under Sections 427 (causing damage) and 324 (voluntarily causing hurt by dangerous weapons) on Monday.
	Varghis, who had been in fishing for more than three decades, said in his complaint that they were fishing 25 nautical miles north off, Rameswaram fishing jetty on Saturday night, when the Lankan navy attacked them, hurling iron balls and bottles and caused damage to fishing nets.
	Sceptical about the case, U. Arulanandham, president, Alliance for the Release of Innocent Fishermen (ARIF), said that by registering the case, the police had recorded the attack incident. Many such attack incidents went unnoticed as the fishermen failed to lodge complaints, he said.
	Registration of the case in the present attack incident might not help bring the Lankan naval personnel to face trial in an Indian court but would help record the incident and secure compensation to the affected fishermen, he added. (The Hindu)

Reconciliation will bridge Tamil-Sinhalese gap: CBK
	
Bridging the gulf that divides Tamil and Sinhalese population in Sri Lanka is essential for the wellbeing of the country, former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga has told The Hindu on Monday.
Ms. Kumaratunga, who was on a private visit to Alappuzha, has told that she was involved in the national unity and reconciliation initiative being undertaken by the present government as part of confidence-building measures.
?There is a huge gulf between Tamils and Sinhalese. There are schools for all communities and there are also schools of different communities. Many Tamils do not speak Sinhalese and vice-versa. Earlier, English was not encouraged or rather downgraded in the country. Unlike India, there was no link language,? she said.
The reconciliation exercise would go a long way in establishing harmony, she said about the recently started process.
Recalling that there was a time when her life was in danger, Ms Kumaratunga said, ?My phones were tapped. My house was watched. A lot of people did not have freedom. Things have changed since the new government took charge. The ruling alliance is a unique experiment in Asia as parties with opposing programmes have come together. Members of former extremist groups, who have given up violence, have also joined the system,? she said.
Asked whether women were enjoying freedom in the country, Ms. Kumaratunga said: ?Certainly. More women are getting into jobs than men. But when it comes to politics, there is no quota. But the new government is going to implement a regulation that at least 25 per cent of the nominees in elections should be women.?
Having had overcome half-a-dozen attacks on her life, she is much more confident than ever. ?I am an atheist; but I believe in my principles, I have never violated basic principles. That has given me a lot of confidence,? she said.

He is bitter about politico?s sweet success
	
This is a sweet food item which the people find indispensable. It is locally produced, but the amount produced here is hardly sufficient to meet the national requirement. So the shortfall is covered by imports.
The tax levy on this food item was increased recently. A certain well known factory producing this food item held back a massive stock of this item on the eve of the tax hike ? you guessed right ? to be released after the resulting price increase.
Alas! A high political authority in charge of the subject issued a fiat that the entire stock be released to the market forthwith. ?And a buyer who appeared from nowhere at the right time purchased the entire stock!
The tax levy came two or three days later giving a windfall to the buyer. ?According to the factory employees the lion?s share of this fortune went to a political bigwig who manipulated the transaction!?
However, the political bigwig who profited from the transaction had made one bad mistake: He had failed to buy the silence of the factory owner, a higher-up himself and the latter being bitter about the outcome, is going round now telling the tale to all and sundry, they say.

No order on Kodikara's motion to court
	
Colombo Chief Magistrate today made no order on a motion filed by Western Province Provincial Councillor Upali Kodikara for an explanation as to why he failed to be present before the CID after a court order was given.
When the motion filed by Mr, Kodikara?s Counsel, R. A. K. Ranawaka was taken up for inquiry, the Counsel told Magistrate Pilapitiya that his client did not present himself before the Cinnamon Gardens Police due to illness and submitted a medical certificate to confirm the fact.
However the Magistrate observed that if Mr. Kodikara had fallen ill on that day he should have informed the Police about it.
Mr Kodikara was arrested and was charged with protesting and creating a tense situation by obstructing the duty of a police officer at a session of PRESIFAC at the BMICH in which former President Mahinda Rajapaksa was called in for questioning.
The Court, while granting bail to Mr.Kodikara, made it obligatory for him to be present before the Cinnamon Gardens Police on Sundays, a stipulation which Mr.Kodikara had failed to adhere to the previous Sunday (22). (T.Farook Thajudeen and Shehan Chamika Silva)

SL could host Ind-Pak cricket series
	
	Sri Lanka has emerged as the likely venue for the much-awaited Indo-Pak bilateral cricket series and an official announcement may be made on November 27.
	While BCCI made it clear that they will not play in the United Arab Emirates and the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) refusing to play in India, the only feasible option left was the island nation, which will act as the neutral venue.
	With only a month?s window available after India finish their Test Series against South Africa on December 7, the series is likely to be confined to three ODIs and two T20 Internationals instead of the original two Tests, five ODIs and two T20 Internationals, according to top BCCI sources.
	The proceedings had been fast-tracked once BCCI president and current ICC chairman Shashank Manohar met PCB chairman Shaharyar Khan and senior official Najam Sethi in presence of ECB supremo and chairman of ?Pakistan Task Force? Giles Clarke.
	Without duvulging any details, both Sethi and Khan had said on Sunday that the meeting with Manohar was ?fruitful? giving an indication that the deadlock on the marquee series was broken.
	?Since PCB will need the permission of Nawaz Sharif before going official, Shaharyar Khan will need to go back to Islamabad and seek the Prime Minister?s permission. Once he gets the green light from the PM, he will again come back to Dubai and intimate his decision to Clarke. Clarke is likely to officially announce the series on November 27,? the source told PTI on Monday.
	It has been learnt that Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) has been approached by the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) and they seem to be keen to host the series.
	The two stadiums earmarked for the series are Khettarama (R Premadasa Stadium) and Pallekele (Kandy). While the receding monsoon has hit the island nation badly, the weather forecast for the last part of December looks good.
	While some T20 matches are scheduled at the Khettarama, the SLC will reschedule them at the first notice, once the official announcement is made.
	This will be the first time that a Test playing nation has rejected playing a series in the UAE since it became Pakistan?s adopted home after the 2009 Lahore attacks.
	BCCI president Manohar is very much against India playing international matches in UAE. In fact Manohar was also a vocal critic when the first part of IPL was shifted to the UAE last year due to the general elections.
	According to reliable sources, UAE has always come under scanner for being a heaven for shady people and match fixers.
	In fact, a recent ODI match between Pakistan and England came under scanner with former England captain Michael Vaughan expressing his suspicion through a series of tweets which he later removed.
	However ICC Chief Executive Dave Richardson downplayed the incident stating that there is no reason to be suspicious about the match.(Indian Express)
