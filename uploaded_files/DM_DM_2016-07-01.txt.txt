Appointing CB Governor: No need to wait for Ravi's return
	
The Purawasi Balaya Organisation (PBO) said today there was no need to wait for the return of Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake to finalize the appointment of the Central Bank's new Governor because the CB did not come under the purview of the Finance Ministry anymore.
PBO member Joseph Stalin said the Central Bank was under the purview of the Prime Minister and accused the government of wasting time by waiting for the Finance Ministers arrival.
They can always phone the minister if they want his consent so badly, he said and added that by allowing the Governor's post to remain vacant for so many days will further jeopardize the economy.
Mr. Stalin urged the President and the Prime Minster to make the appointment without any further delay.
He said the appointment should not be a political appointment like that of former governor Ajith Nivard Cabraal.
Meanwhile, he recalled the assurance given by the President and the Prime Minister not to reappoint former governor Arjuna Mahendran, whose term of office ended on June 30.
Amid several allegations and objections against Mr. Mahendran and knowing that his tenure will come to an end soon, the government had failed to come up with a suitable replacement, Mr. Stalin said.
He said none of the investigations had cleared Mr. Mahendran of the charges against him.
The court case only said that there has been no violation of human rights with regard to the Bond Sale. It doesnt mean whether a fraud had taken place. In this context, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghes comments on the ITN over Mr. Mahendrans allegations are not acceptable, Mr. Stalin said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

CTSU alleges Dy. Minister assaulted prinicpal
	
The Ceylon Teachers Service Union (CTSU) yesterday alleged that Internal Affairs, Wayamba Development and Cultural Affairs Deputy Minister Palitha Thewarapperuma had assaulted the principal of Meegastenna Primary School in Matugama, while he was forcibly enrolling 9 students to the school.
Speaking to the Daily Mirror, CTSU Chief Secretary Mahinda Jayasinghe alleged the principal was admitted to the Nagoda General Hospital after being assaulted by the deputy minister.
The deputy minister staged a protest for several days and he has pressurized many of the school principals in this educational zone. The principal who was assaulted by the deputy minister has once made a statement to the media regarding the pressure imposed by him on them, he added.
Meanwhile, he said the deputy minister had forcibly enrolled nine students to grade one classes by entering their names in the school registers.
It is against the circulars of the schools to enroll these students as the number of students that should be taken in to grade one classes has already reached the limit, he added. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)

Justice for crimes committed by both sides vital for reconciliation: TNA
	
The Tamil National Alliance (TNA) today reiterated that justice for crimes committed in the past by both the Sri Lanka military forces and the LTTE is a necessary precondition to achieve meaningful reconciliation.
Issuing a statement on the oral update of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights to the Human Rights Council on the implementation of the Resolution on Sri Lanka, the TNA said the full implementation of operative paragraphs 6 and 7 is vital to ensure trust and credibility.
We are particularly encouraged by the number of countries that continue to urge Sri Lanka to fulfill its commitments. Resolution 30/1 represents the solemn commitment of Sri Lanka to its own citizens, and to the Tamil people who we represent, and must be implemented, it said.
Commenting on the oral update of the High Commissioner, it said the update captures accurately the opportunities and challenges for reconciliation and accountability in Sri Lanka.
We are grateful to the High Commissioner and his Office for their continued engagement in this matter. We are however concerned about the very slow pace of implementation with respect to a number of human rights issues in Sri Lanka. In particular, delays in releasing private lands illegally occupied by the military; the continued use of the Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA) and the governments failure to repeal it; the breach of undertakings to release those held under the PTA; and the continuing surveillance and harassment of civilians in the North and East.
Delay in the resettlement of displaced people in both the North and East, and in the restoration of normal life by providing then with housing, livelihood opportunities and other facilities continues to be a matter of concern and is a great impediment to the process of reconciliation and the return to normalcy.
With respect to the reconciliation mechanisms proposed by the government, we welcome the tabling of the Office on Missing Persons (OMP) Bill in Parliament. The government consulted us on the Bill, and we are pleased that several of the extensive revisions we urged have been included in the gazetted text. We commend the government for its constructive engagement on the Bill. We look forward to further amendments being moved at the committee stage, and to the early passage of the law through Parliament. A law on the lines contemplated by the Bill, if implemented sincerely, could bring relief to families of the forcibly disappeared who are in desperate need of answers. The OMP must represent a dramatic break from the experience of failed Commissions, including the current Paranagama Commission which lacks credibility.
We also note the High Commissioners observations on the importance of crafting a new Constitution that serves all citizens of Sri Lanka and the support that this proposition has received from several countries. An acceptable resolution to the national question through adequate constitutional arrangements is fundamental to the process of genuine and effective reconciliation and to the attainment of justice with equality and permanent peace by all people in Sri Lanka. We will continue to remain engaged with all parties towards this end, with a view to addressing the longstanding national question that has plagued Sri Lanka, the statement said.

The Parliamentary Reforms and Mass Media Ministry a short while ago rejected issuing a statement regarding the appointment of the next Governor of the Central Bank (CB) of Sri Lanka.
In a statement, Ministry Secretary Nimal Bopage said several media institutions had published a news item quoting a press release which was allegedly issued by the Government Information Department.
No such statement had been issued by the Government Information Department, the Ministry or the Government, he said. 
However, a press release on an appointment of the next CB governor with the letter-head of the Government Information Department was issued earlier today.
The release said the appointment will be made by the President after having a discussion with the Prime Minister and Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake upon his return to the country.

Navy to look into Yoshitha after financial probe is over
	
Lieutenant Yoshitha Rajapaksa was under investigation for financial crimes and therefore other allegations allegedly done as a Naval Officer would be investigated by the Sri Lanka Navy, after the conclusion of the civil case on financial crimes, Navy Spokesman Captain Alevi Akram said.
Captain Akram responding to a question raised by a journalist as to why the Sri Lanka Navy treats Lt. Rajapaksa and Lt. Commander K.C Welagedara differently, he said there was no discrimination whatsoever and added that Sri Lanka Navy was awaiting the ruling from President Maithripala Sirisena as the Commander in Chief on the appeal made to him by Lt. Commander Welagedara against his punishment.
He said comparatively, the offence committed by Lt. Commander Welagedara being an officer of a higher rank was serious than the offences committed by Lt. Rajapaksa, of a lower rank and that was why a Court Martial was held against Lt. Commander Welagedara.
He was demoted four ranks, which was a minor punishment, considering the magnitude of his offence, Captain Akram said.
However, a final decision will be taken on him on the directive of President Sirisena as he has made an appeal to him on the punishments meted out to him by the Navy, he added.
Captain Akram said Lt. Commander Welagedara, while serving as the Chief Commanding Officer of the Naval and Maritime Academy in Trincomalee that trains 300 Naval Officers and 1,500 Navy men, had left his service station without prior approval of a higher authority. (Sandun A Jayasekera)

Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) Chairman Carlo Fonseka said he would resign if those who pass out from the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM) in Malabe were given provisional registration to practice as doctors in Sri Lanka.
He said this during a meeting held with the Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) at the SLMC office on Thursday.
GMOA Treasurer Nalinda Herath told a media briefing that Prof. Fonseka told them that the SLMC stance on the SAITM controversy remains unchanged despite any political interference.
We informed him of attempts by those backing the SAITM medical degree shop to give it SLMC approval. Just like the drama in which the Health Ministry showed that Court approval was obtained by SAITM students to carry out their clinical studies at state hospitals, the students will file a Court case against the Health Ministry, demanding SLMC approval. Later the Health Ministry will agree in Court that the SLMC approval will be given accordingly. The ministry will later interpret it as a Court order, Dr. Herath said.
However, the GMOA said if the students who obtain their MBBS at SAITM were given provisional registration by the SLMC, the entire SLMC staff should resign. (Piyumi Fonseka)

SL still to meet min. standards to end human trafficking: US
	
The Sri Lankan government has not fully met with the minimum standards for the elimination of human trafficking but it is making significant efforts to do so, the Annual Trafficking in Persons Report released by US State Secretary John Kerry revealed yesterday. 
It said Sri Lanka is primarily a source and, to a lesser extent, a destination country, for men, women, and children subjected to forced labor and sex trafficking.
Some of the Sri Lankan men, women, and children who migrate to the Middle East, Southeast Asia, and Afghanistan to work in the construction, garment, and domestic service sectors are subjected to forced labor. Before leaving Sri Lanka, many migrant workers go into debt to pay high recruitment fees imposed by unscrupulous labor recruitment agenciesmost of them members of Sri Lankas Association of Licensed Foreign Employment Agenciesand their unlicensed sub-agents.
Migrant laborers receive a monetary advance as an incentive to move abroad, only to be trapped in debt bondage upon arrival at their destination. Some recruitment agencies commit fraud by changing the agreed upon job, employer, conditions, or salary after the migrants arrival. Some Sri Lankan women are subjected to forced prostitution in Jordan, Maldives, Malaysia, Singapore, and elsewhere. Within the country, women and children are subjected to sex trafficking in brothels. Boys are more likely than girls to be forced into prostitution in coastal areas for child sex tourism. Children, individuals with physical deformities, and those from socially vulnerable groups are forced to beg or engage in criminal activity in Sri Lankas largest cities.
Some child domestic workers in Colombo, generally from the Tamil tea estate sector, are subjected to physical, sexual, and mental abuse, non-payment of wages, and restrictions of movement indicators of labor trafficking. A small number of women from Asia, Central Asia, Europe, and the Middle East have been subjected to forced prostitution in Sri Lanka in recent years.
Police accept bribes to permit brothels to operate, some of which 347 exploit trafficking victims. Sub-agents collude with officials to procure fake or falsified travel documents to facilitate travel of Sri Lankans abroad.
During the reporting period, the government ratified the 2000 UN TIP Protocol and the Cabinet approved the governments national action plan to combat human trafficking. Despite these measures, the government did not demonstrate overall increasing anti-trafficking efforts compared to the previous reporting period; therefore Sri Lanka is placed on Tier 2 Watch List for the fourth consecutive year.
Per the Trafficking Victims Protection Act, Sri Lanka was granted a waiver from an otherwise required downgrade to Tier 3 because its government has devoted sufficient resources to a written plan that, if implemented, would constitute significant efforts to meet the minimum standards. Authorities slightly increased investigations and prosecutions of trafficking cases; however, convictions stagnated at one trafficker convictedthe same number as in 2014and the sentence of two years imprisonment was not sufficiently stringent to deter future trafficking crimes.
Provisions for victim protection were inadequate, as the government arrested sex trafficking victims and charged them with crimes committed as a direct result of being subjected to trafficking, provided no specialized services to male victims, and mixed child victims with criminals in state institutions, the report said in its comments on Sri Lanka.

TN coastal police bust Lankan refugee trafficking racket
	
The Tamil Nadu Coastal Security Group has busted a racket in ferrying Sri Lankan Tamil refugees to New Zealand on the promise of jobs, following the arrest of two persons  E. Balaji and R. Yuvakumar  from refugee camps in Vellore and Kanniyakumari districts on Tuesday.
Coastal Security Group sources told The Hindu on Friday that the duo had planned to ferry around one hundred refugees from Muttom in Kanniyakymari district to New Zealand.
A 75-foot-long boat bearing Kerala registration number and three vans, which were meant for transporting the refugees, were seized through coordinated efforts of enforcement agencies, including the Q Branch police.
Nine thousand litres of diesel and 4000 litres of water were recovered from the boat.
Investigation revealed that the duo received Rs. 2 lakh from each of the refugees to ferry them to New Zealand on the promise of lucrative jobs. Intensive patrolling with the aid of speed boats off shore and all-terrain vehicles on shore resulted in foiling such illegal attempts, sources in the Coastal Security Group said.
Recently, 14 Sri Lankan nationals who were staying in Tiruchendur and Kanniyakumari before being ferried to New Zealand were arrested. Five of them did not have valid passports.
CSG officials said that earlier in June illegal bids to ferry 33 refugees were thwarted. The CSG personnel, led by Additional Director General of Police C. Sylendra Babu, organised an awareness camp at the Mandapam refugee camp recently.
