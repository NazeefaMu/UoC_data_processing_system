Aussie flu pandemic could wipe out 33 million
	

UK, (Daily Mail), 8 March 2018 - Humanity would be virtually powerless to stop the spread of a killer flu virus that could take 33 million lives in just 200 days, experts have warned.

Professor Robert Dingwall, a flu expert, said that covering your mouth when you sneeze and washing your hands are the most effective ways to stop the virus spreading - but even these measures are unlikely to be enough. 
His warning comes after Dr Jonathan Quick, Chair of the Global Health Council, warned that a deadly flu mutation could take place any day and prove to be the deadliest pandemic in human history. 
One such new strain, which is believed to be partially responsible for a 40 per cent increase in flu-related deaths in the US and UK, is dubbed the Aussie flu, because it originated in Australia.

Be alert to excessive calcium levels in the brain!
	
Latest research studies reveal that this condition can give rise to Parkinsons disease


Parkinsonism is a general term which refers to a set of neurological disorders which cause problems related to the movement similar to Parkinsons disease including Bradykinesia (slowing with degradation of repetitive movements), stiffness and tremors. Even though subtle, tremors and bradykinesic movements can be commonly seen among elderly people. Features in Parkinsonism tend to be non-specific and exaggerated. 
As far as the etiology of Parkinsonism is concerned, Parkinsons disease is so far the commonest neurodegenerative cause (80% of affected cases) where multiple system atrophy, progressive supra-nuclear palsy and cortico-basal degeneration are also known to play important roles and therefore referred to as atypical parkinsonism or Parkinson-plus syndromes. These Atypical Parkinsonism has a worse prognosis compared to that of the typical one and do not respond well to dopaminergic medications. 
Symptomatic Parkinsonism can also occur due to various secondary causes such as vascular conditions, drugs, infections, toxic agents and structural anomalies of central nervous system. Drug-induced Parkinsonism is known to be the commonest condition of all types and caused by various antipsychotics, anti-emetics and sodium valproate. Vascular Parkinsonism also known as arteriosclerotic pseudo Parkinsonism is characterized by an emphasized lower body, disturbances in gait and concomitant impairment of cognition.
Even though there is no clear-cut method of diagnosis available for Parkinsonism, revealing the possible etiology plays a very important role in treating Parkinsonism.
If it is drugs, the dosage should either be altered or replaced with an alternative with less side effects. Additionally, lifestyle modifications such as regular exercises, physical and occupational therapy, prevention from falls should be taken into consideration while taking care of affected individuals.

What is Parkinsons disease
Being the commonest neurodegenerative cause of Parkinsonism, Parkinsons disease is defined as a clinical syndrome characterized by lesions in the basal ganglia which mainly involves the degeneration of Neuro melanin-containing neurons in the brainstem particularly in the region of
Substantia Nigra. The root cause of Parkinsons disease has been identified to be multifactorial with the involvement of factors such as heredity, positive family history, environmental toxins and advanced age. This condition usually occurs between the ages 40-70 with a peak incidence in the seventh decade of life.
The major clinical picture of this condition includes resting tremors, rigidity, stiffness, Akinesia and dysfunctional postural reflexes where all these symptoms and signs are known to be gradually worsening over time. Other non-motor features may include depression, loss of smell, gastric disturbances andcognitive changes.
A definitive diagnosis of Parkinsons disease can be made only at an autopsy by the identification of the presence of degenerative changes in the brain stem and Lewy bodies predominantly in Substantia nigra.
Even though, there is no permanent cure for Parkinsons disease, symptoms can be improved with various medical and surgical interventions.
The most popular medications used in affected individuals include dopamine agonists, inhibitors of catechol-0-menthyltransferase (COMT) and monoamine oxidase type B (MAO-B) inhibitors whereas major surgical interventions available include Pallidotomy, chronic deep-brain stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) and Globus Pallidus Internus using an implantable pulse generator (IPG).
Finding a clear-cut line of demarcation between Parkinsonism and Parkinsons disease
Parkinsons disease is considered to be the commonest neurodegenerative cause of Parkinsonism accounting for more than 80% of the identified cases. Since there is no definitive diagnosis for both these conditions, it is advisable to check the history of the individual and pay attention to the clinical features and progression of the disease over time. Parkinsonism is a comparatively rapidly progressive condition than Parkinsons disease with additional features like hallucinations, delusions and dementia.
As far as treatment is concerned, Parkinsonism is known to be taking a longer duration to respond or does not respond at all to the treatment with Levodopa (Dopaminergic therapy), compared to that of Parkinsons disease.

Latest news
Latest research studies have found that excessive calcium levels in the brain cells have a chance of forming toxic clusters which play the hallmark of Parkinsons disease.
The international team led by University of Cambridge, after carrying out several studies has come to a conclusion that calcium itself can mediate the interaction between small membranous structures inside nerve endings, which are known to play a major role in neuronal signaling of the brain and alpha-synuclein, the protein associated with Parkinsons disease. 
There is a fine balance of calcium and alpha-synuclein in the cell and when there is too much of one or the other, the balance is tipped and aggregation begins, leading to Parkinsons disease says co-first author Dr. Amberley Stephens.
Therefore, according to those scientific studies, excess levels of either calcium or alpha-synuclein might be what initiates this chemical chain reaction, which results in the gradual death of brain cells which would ultimately give rise to Parkinsons disease.
After all, this newest finding about the role of calcium and alpha-synuclein in physiological or pathological processes will for sure help in the formation of brand new modalities of treatment for Parkinsons disease like for an example patients who are on calcium channel blockers for certain heart diseases would develop a potential resistance against
Parkinsons disease.

Brace Yourself for Malocclusion Correction
	

Dental issues do not merely cause problems for health, but may affect your appearance as well. What happens when your teeth become more forward than you are You are in trouble of course! A protruding set of teeth should tell you that its time to visit your dental surgeon. You may dread wearing braces; everyones childhood nightmare. However it will be worth it once the treatment is complete. Dr. Vipula Wickramasinghe, General Secretary of the Sri Lanka Dental Association and Regional Dental Surgeon of the Colombo District, spoke to the Health Capsule and shed light on the treatment procedure.
Braces are used to correct the malalignment of the teeth. A diagnosis of whether the malocclusion should be corrected or not should be made first. There are certain conditions which may seem like malocclusions, but are perfectly normal. If there is a correction to be made in the positioning of teeth it can be done in several ways, he stated.
He further added that braces are not resorted to if it can be helped. Sometimes certain types of malocclusions can be corrected without braces with just a removable type of plates. There are other conditions of malocclusions which need braces while others require surgical approach which is then followed by braces. Orthodontics plus surgery are required.
If the malocclusion is only a small issue, a general dental surgeon will be able to diagnose and recommend treatment. If the problem is a bit severe, the patient will be directed towards an orthodontist who is specialized in braces and treatments. It is an aesthetic oriented treatment. Spaces between teeth, clock line teeth, longer teeth and gaps between dental arches can be corrected by using braces, said Dr. Wickramasinghe.

Causes
According to Dr. Wickramasinghe, there are certain causes for malalignment of teeth. A clock line set of teeth can be genetically inherited from parents to children. Certain habits also cause the malalignment of the teeth. Thumb sucking, using pacifiers during childhood as well as biting on pencils, breathing through the mouth can lead to malalignment. The premature extraction of deciduous teeth untimely or even the extraction of permanent teeth can also lead to deformities in the positioning of the teeth. These are the typical basic causes for malocclusion, he warned.
The general advice given to parents by a dental surgeon is that if they notice any form of malalignment of the teeth, then the child should be directed towards a medical professional. Parents are advised not to arrive at a diagnosis on their own. Go to a dental surgeon and get a professional diagnosis and make a proper decision on the treatment, if its needed. A dental surgeon is normally able to understand and identify the complications of the malalignment. If the malocclusion is more complex, the patient will be directed towards an orthodontist. If you feel you have a malocclusion you are free to consult a dental surgeon at any time without making a diagnosis yourself, stressed Dr. Wickramasinghe.

Never too old for treatment
It should be kept in mind that there is no specific age to visit a dentist and get a diagnosis for malocclusion. It is true that there are certain condition treatments which may have to start at a specific age due to various reasons. However, this is a decision for the dental surgeon to make. There is a common myth that malalignments can only be treated in children between the ages of 12-15. This is not true. A spurt of growth is observed in the age groups within 12-18 which is considered the best period to correct teeth. However this does not mean that once this age is exceeded malocclusions cannot be corrected. Late 25-30 and even a good set of teeth at 40 can be set correctly using braces. Age doesnt matter. Normally the period of the spurt of growth is recommended for treatment as the duration or the treatment reduces during this period as correction takes place quickly during the growth years.
Before braces are inserted, X-rays of the patients jaw are needed. Sometimes the extraction of teeth are needed to make space before using braces to push back the teeth. Teeth should be cleaned and polished before braces are inserted during treatment. Before and during the treatment oral hygiene is vital. Caries, tartar and plaque have to be cleaned. Fillings should be performed if necessary before braces are inserted, explicated Dr. Wickramasinghe.

Treatment
Treatment for malalignments include removable plates, braces or surgery and braces. The treatment of malocclusions by using braces is usually performed under the supervision of an orthodontist. It is a dynamic process and you should go to a specialized person to get this kind of treatment. The idea of the correction using braces is 100% based on the movement of the teeth by applying a force. It is not just pushing back the teeth, but the gross movement of teeth even from the roots itself using the force. Additional force can lead to damage of the teeth. Hence it is an extremely tricky treatment. Before the outset of brace treatment, the procedure should be explained to the patient beforehand. Simple complications that can be corrected by braces can be handled by general dental surgeons. However the more complex issues need to be directed towards an orthodontist. The big state hospitals have this service with well-developed fully functional orthodontist units available free of charge. Treatment can be obtained from the private sector as well, but it is more costly, he added.
He stressed that braces come in various forms. Braces with metallic wires, coloured wires or even braces can be set behind the teeth so that people are unaware of the fact that you are wearing braces are currently available. The period during which you have to wear the braces may vary according to the severity of the malocclusion. Uncomplicated cases usually require about 1-1 and a 1/2 years of treatment. More complex cases may extend treatment for 2-21/2 years. The orthodontist should be frequently visited once a month for checkups. The braces cannot be removed in the middle of treatment. If so, the treatment cannot be continued from where it was stopped. You are left on square one and the treatment has to be started from the beginning. Therefore, before treatment is commenced its important to talk to the patient about the procedure, time period of treatment and cost. Once they comply the procedure will be started.

Maintenance during treatment
Due to the development of current techniques, the outcome of the treatment given can be predicted and shown to the patient, so that the patient is informed of the kind of appearance he or she will get after the treatment. Dr. Wickramasinghe stressed that while wearing braces it is important to pay attention to the maintenance of proper and strict oral hygiene. Brushing of teeth properly, using a fluoridated tooth paste, using interdental brushes are some facts to remember. It is very important to clean the space between the wire and teeth. 100% oral hygiene is necessary or the tendency to develop unnecessary caries is quite high when wearing braces, he warned.
Orthodontics and braces have come a long way in terms of development. On the other hand it may cost a lot of money. It is a huge commitment with frequent visits to the dental surgeon as it is an aesthetic oriented treatment. However the outcome received is 100% favourable. Get appropriate advice from the dentist. If and only if braces are recommended, start treatment as early as possible without delay, advised Dr. Wickramasinhe on a final note.

Canadian doctors demand lower salaries
	

By Amy B Wang (Canada), March 7 2018 - In a move that can only be described as utterly Canadian, hundreds of doctors in Quebec are protesting their pay raises, saying they already make too much money. 
As of Wednesday afternoon, more than 700 physicians, residents and medical students from the Canadian province had signed an online petition asking for their pay raises to be canceled. A group named Mdecins Qubcois Pour le Rgime Public (MQRP), which represents Quebec doctors and advocates for public health, started the petition Feb. 25. 
We, Quebec doctors who believe in a strong public system, oppose the recent salary increases negotiated by our medical federations, the petition reads in French. 
The physicians group said it could not in good conscience accept pay raises when working conditions remained difficult for others in their profession  including nurses and clerks  and while patients live with the lack of access to required services because of drastic cuts in recent years.

Eat confidently to prolong life
	

As Sri Lankans, we consume a carbohydrate based diet since rice is our staple meal. The total carbohydrate in food includes starch, sugar and fibRE. More refined, fast release, staple carbohydrate food are identified as one of the major risk factor for the development of obesity and diabetes like non-communicable diseases.
During the digestion of food, both starch and sugar breakdown into glucose and is the cause for elevated blood glucose levels. There is an index that indicates the physiological effect of carbohydrate food sources which is known as the Glycemic Index. 

Glycemic Index (GI) 
Glycemic Index (GI) is a number that indicates the blood glucose raising potential of digestible carbohydrate rich foods. The carbohydrate in food is digested at different rates releasing glucose into the blood stream. According to that rate, different food are classified as low (GI <55), medium (56 >GI<69) or high (GI >70) GI foods. 

Low, medium and high GI food sources 
Low GI: These are carbohydrates that break down slowly during digestion, release glucose gradually into the bloodstream and keep blood sugar levels steady. Soy products, beans, fruits, low fat dairy food, pasta, porridge, lentils, minimally processed grains, nuts and non-starchy vegetables are few examples for low GI foods.  Medium GI: These are carbohydrates that break down moderately during digestion and release glucose moderately into the bloodstream. Medium GI foods are basmati rice, white and sweet potatoes, corn, white rice, etc.  High GI: These are carbohydrates that break down quickly during digestion, release glucose rapidly into the blood stream and cause rapid fluctuations in blood sugar levels. Ex: corn chips, watermelon, honey, doughnuts, French fries, cornflakes, baked potato, dates etc. 

Importance of GI for a healthy life 
The GI is a useful nutritional concept which gives new view and relationship between the physiological effects of carbohydrate-rich food and our health. GI is important to minimize the insulin related problems by identifying and avoiding food which have the greatest effect on our blood glucose level. Our body will perform well when our blood glucose level is kept relatively constant. If our blood glucose level drops too low, we become lethargic and or experience increased hunger. And also if blood glucose level rise too high, the pancreas secretes more insulin to drop down the excess blood glucose level, primarily by converting the excess sugar to stored fat. Therefore, if we clearly identify the low, medium and high GI food, then we have a great opportunity to protect our health from most of the diseases. For example, consumption of low GI food might be useful in the prevention and reducing the risk of type 2 diabetes, coronary heart diseases, several types of cancer, obesity, chronic kidney diseases, formation of gall stones, neural tube defects, formation of uterine fibroids and prolong physical persistence and improve insulin sensitivity. And GI is also a useful tool in planning diets for diabetic patients and is a key player in controlling diabetes.  Moreover, GI of food is different when it is eaten alone than when it is combined with other food. When we eat food that has high GI value, we can combine it with other low or medium GI food to balance the effect on blood glucose level. The consumption of high GI food is also very important since most nutritious food have a higher GI value. Therefore, the use of GI needs to be balanced with basic nutrients for a healthy life. 

Factors that affect the GI of food 
The GI of food is dependent on several factors. Most of international and local research studies are focusing on how these factors effect on physical and chemical properties of food and eventually how it influences the GI value of foods. 


1.Variety 
The GI of rice is affected by the proportion of amylose to amylopectin in the grains. The higher the proportion of amylopectin gives higher GI, which is made up of branched-starch molecules. Hence it can more easily break down in the gut than the single chain amylose.
As indicated in rice based research study, all varieties of raw red rice do not have a low GI value compared with white rice. Only certain varieties of parboiled red rice have low GI while red raw, white raw, red basmati and white basmati have high GI whereas keeri samba has a
medium GI value. However, parboiled naadu belongs to a lower GI category compared to Indian basmati rice and Pakistan basmati rice. The parboiling process lowers the glycemic index, by changing its physico-chemical properties. 

2.Cooking methods 
The application of heat and moisture for a longer period of time disorganizes the crystalline structure. During cooking, heat and water soften the hard compact starch granules by absorbing water, swell and then break. As a result, starch (amylose and amylopectin) molecules are released leading to gelatinization with breakdown of the crystalline structure. This makes starch more bio-available for enzymic action leading to increased glucose absorption. Thus, physical-chemical properties of starch and degree of starch gelatinization influence the glycemic response and the GI of a food. This indicates that food subject to wet heat processing (boiling, steaming) tended to elicit higher GI values than the foods that are subjected to dry heat processing (roasting). 

3.Dietary component 
Food or meal components such as dietary fiber, moisture and protein contents affect the glycemic response. The presence of higher dietary fiber lowers the GI in mixed meals and legumes since fiber protects the starchy carbohydrate from digestive enzymes or slows digestion process in the digestive tract and as a result of that, conversion of the carbohydrate to glucose is slowed down. Moreover, protein also decreases the GI level because, protein will promote the additional insulin secretion, resulting in lower blood glucose level. And also, both protein and fat delay stomach emptying, thereby slowing the rate, so the carbohydrate can be digested and absorbed. Furthermore, high moisture in green leafy porridge contributes to decrease the GI. 

4.Particle size 
Starch in carbohydrate food exists in the form of large granules. Grinding, rolling, pressing a kernel or other starch food can disrupt the granules and increases GI since disruption of starch granules facilitates the availability of amylose or amylopectin starch large molecules for digestion. Some research studies have shown that industrially milled flour with relatively smaller particle size distribution has higher GI compared to food made of stone grounded flour where the particle size is larger. 

5.Ripenessof fruit 
When fruit is ripe, starch converts to sugar and increases the GI. In conclusion, both amount and types of carbohydrate in food affect blood glucose level. Studies also show that the total amount of carbohydrate in food is a stronger predictor of blood glucose than GI.
Both of these quantity and quality of carbohydrate in food are measured by Glycemic Load (GL). Thus it is better to calculate the GL using the GI rather than using only GI to guide the diet plan.

Female hand  a character portrayal
	
Human hand  Trailblazer of human civilization

All renowned palmists in their great works have set apart a chapter on the Shape and Size of Hand. Because they have considered that the shape of the hand in reading the character and fortune of a subject is as important as the lines and mounts on the palm.
However, most astrologers have discussed various types of hands in general but have not presented a study specific to the hand of the female.
Why the female stands apart
Human tendencies, feelings, emotions, desires and aspirations among many other things are common to both male and female. They share the same set of values as well as biological needs with males. However, there can be manners, mannerisms and reflex actions peculiar to women.
Specific role assigned by nature and tradition
Nature has created woman for a special role with skills and instincts essential for playing that role. Women are not expected to do hard manual labour. Nature has designed various parts of the anatomy of a female to suit the biological, reproductive and other `feminine functions. For example, look at the hand of a female. A womans hand unlike a mans is soft, supple and well formed. One would not come across a womans hand characterized by stiff, heavy fingers, a clumsy thumb and a hard palm.
Elementary hand and the Murderers Hand are hardly seen among women.
The three main types, Conical, Spatulate and Square
A great French palmist has said that out of a 100 women in France, 40 belong to the conical type, thirty to the Square type and the other 30 to the spatulate type. What this great palmist says holds good for women in other countries as well.
The two broader categories: Small Thumb and Large Thumb
Palmists divide women into two broader categories: those with large thumbs and those with small thumbs.
The differences
Women with large thumbs are more intelligent than sensitive. Serious things in life like books on important subjects attract them. Women with small thumbs are more sensitive than intelligent. Glamour, splendor and beautycaptivate them.
Why Elementary hand is absent
Accounting for the absence of the Elementary Hand among women, a great French palmist says that the cares of maternity being extremely complex and difficult, women require an instinct of a higher plane than that is revealed by the Elementary Hand.
Spatulate Hand with a small thumb
He says that a woman with a Spatulate Hand and a small thumb possesses a great fund of affection, desire for freedom, an imperious desire of action and a thorough understanding of life.
Women with Square fingers possess a lot of common sense. They have soft, supple hands with faintly marked knots. They are very witty.
Women with soft and supple hands with conical fingers and small thumbs love all that is brilliant. They are indolent, fanciful and sensual.
A woman with a delicate smooth hand and pointed fingers whose palm is narrow and elastic has tastes ruled by the heart rather than the by the mind and senses. Owners of such hands are calm and radiant and are endowed with grace and inspiration.
The somewhat large thumb of a woman indicates that she is cautious in the affairs of the heart and she holds sensations under control of a well- balanced will. Women with a small thumb are seductive and very fickle. They are inclined towards excessive coquetry. They are overwhelmed by unreasonable jealousy and unreliable nerves.
Short thumbed women cannot keep secrets. They are not reliable. They are always very inquisitive.
Large thumbed women are somewhat slow in taking stock of a given situation. Yet they are shrewd and calculating. For them marriage is a matter of business. They are great believers in common sense. They are domineering and they speak in a loud tone. They are trustworthy.

FUTA hits out at govt.'s inability to curb violence
	
The Federation of University Teachers' Association (FUTA) yesterday said the governments inability and reluctance to enforce the law against perpetrators of communal violence had led to the serious escalation of communal tensions.
FUTA Assistant Secretary Dr Athulasiri Samarakoon said in a statement that the government should enforce the law strongly and impartially against perpetrators of such communal violence, as well as against their instigators who seek economic and political advantage through them.
Regrettably, the governments inability and reluctance to enforce the law has led to the serious escalation of communal tensions and increased outbreaks of gratuitous violence and destruction on the flimsiest of excuses, he said.
He said no individual or community had the right to take the law into its own hands or to wreak vengeance as in the most recent instance of communal violence.
He also said the majority community should be most vigilant to ensure that it was not seen as imposing a dominant view or values on others by virtue of its numerical and political superiority over other groups.
The government should take immediate measures to take stern actions against all parties and prosecute all wrong-doers irrespective of ethnicity, vocation, political connections, social influence or wealth, he said.
He said the labelling of groups of people as majority and minority purely in terms of population percentages was detrimental to true pluralism and the country should recognise real differences, without feeling threatened or devaluing the diversity in any way. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)

Gampaha Hospital staff strike over elevator death
	
The staff, including the doctors of the Gampaha General Hospital, had launched a strike following the death of 33-year-old man, who was killed in a mishap involving the elevator at the hospital yesterday.
Dr Lakmal Ruparatne said there had been technical failures very often at the hospital, to which no repairs had been done.
The Police said the incident took place when the elevator was stuck mid-way.
When it was opened manually and the rescuers were attempting to take passengers out, the victim had reportedly jumped out of the elevator from five feet above ground level and knocked his head on the floor.
Dr Ruparatne said although they had informed authorities to take action over the dilapidated condition of the elevators, they had not paid attention.
We urge the administrators to look into the issues and deploy personnel to repair the elevator and the generator, Dr Ruparatne added. (Thilakaratna Disanayake)

Though some ministers blamed the police for their failure to control the prevailing tense situation, the Police is also part of the government, former President and MP Mahinda Rajapaksa said yesterday.
Speaking to journalists at his residence in Mirihana, Mr Rajapaksa said that the government should be held responsible for the events that take place in the country.
This shows the Governments inability. It has failed to control the riots, he said.
He said during his tenure, order and proper system were in place and did not allow incidents to spill out of control.
Since there is no order in the present government, there is no one to take responsibility, he added. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

Sri Lanka Muslim Congress (SLMC) leader Minister Rauff Hakeem yesterday asked the government to issue shoot at sight orders to enforce the police curfew in the affected areas.
Mr. Hakeem told the Daily Mirror there were lapses initially in dealing with the situation, but the incidents could not be solely blamed on the government.
He said there were problems in the preparedness in facing the violence of this scale. The SLMC leader urged the government to probe the failure on the part of the intelligence authorities to assess the scale of violence in advance and take preemptive measures.
Definitely, there were issues regarding intelligence services. They failed to assess the scale of violence to be unleashed and give some forewarning. That has to be probed. We were not prepared to face violence in such high scale, he said.
Also, he said there were some underground movements involved in the violence. (Kelum Bandara)

Heated arguments in House over Rajitha's statement
	
Heated arguments ensued in Parliament yesterday over a statement made by Cabinet Spokesman Rajitha Senaratne at the recent Cabinet briefing that two MPs and several others connected to a political party were behind the communal tension in Kandy.
JVP leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake said a state-owned national newspaper had reported quoting minister Senaratne that two MPs, two members of a local government body of a new political party, a party organiser and a coordinating Secretary of an MP had involved in the incident.
He said the people, in general, were of the view that there was a political force behind this series of communal clashes.
Mr. Dissanayake requested speaker Karu Jayasuriya to present in parliament the names of the two MPs who were behind this incident as reported in the newspaper.
He said certain people were using racism which was on the increase in the past for their petty political gains.
Joint Opposition MP Bandula Gunawardane said the government was trying to further provoke racism through such statements when the joint opposition including former President Mahinda Rajapaksa had extended their fullest support to control the violent situation
"Is it imprisoning MPs that should be done at a time when the country is engulfed in tension," he asked.
JO MP Dinesh Gunawardane said MPs had a right to go to the police and added that steps should be taken to ensure their rights.
He said during the Black July in 1983, the then government also alleged that the opposition was behind it and banned several political parties including the JVP but it was revealed later on that the UNP was behind it.
JO MP Rohitha Abeygunawardane, who joined the cross talk said the government should resolve the issue without pointing the finger at the opposition.
He said Minister Rajitha Senaratne should be removed as cabinet spokesman for some time.
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya said the CID had launched a comprehensive investigation into the incident and that he would present its report in parliament soon after he received it. (Ajith Siriwardana)

GMOA Media Spokesman Dr. Samantha Ananda told a news conference that the government had signed an agreement with an Indian company named Sukran Hospital Solutions to outsource local hospitals laundry services at a cost of USD 7.5 million.
The authorities, including the Health Ministry, should immediately withdraw this decision. Otherwise it would risk the jobs of Sri Lankans even before the Economic and Technology Corporation Agreement (ETCA) with India is signed, he said.
He said it would create issues in the Sri Lankan job market and it would result in thousands of Sri Lankans losing their jobs.
He also said local small-scale entrepreneurs were handling hospital laundry services in a appropriate and lawful manner and added that there was no necessity to outsource it to an Indian company.
The government is trying to outsource every aspect of our health service to India, unit by unit. The initial step towards this move was the Indian ambulance service with was established in Sri Lanka. The second step is the outsourcing of laundry services at hospitals, he said. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)

HRC writes to Prime Minister expressing its deep concern over; Recent violent events based on religi
	
The Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka wishes to express its deep concern and dismay at the recent violent events that took place in the town of Theldeniya and its surroundings over the past couple of days.
We wish to express our deep sorrow at the loss of human life caused by this cycle of religious intolerance and hatred orchestrated by certain prejudiced and violent elements in the country.
According to preliminary investigations carried out by the Human Rights Commission, it is observed that the Muslim and Sinhala communities in Digana, the area in which the tragic death of a person occurred due to the incident on 22nd February, appear to co-exist amicably and peacefully. The violence appears to be instigated by external elements in an organized manner causing communal division, death and destruction of property.
The Commission notes that the most recent cycle of violence based on religious intolerance is symptomatic of a series of similar incidents of hatred based violence that we have witnessed since the Aluthgama riots that took place in 2014. The more recent examples of religious violence took place in Gintota (in the South) and Ampara (in the East). In such instances a random incident appears to spark off sectarian violence with the involvement of outside elements. So also in the current spate of violence in the Theldeniya Town and surrounding areas. These sporadic incidents of violence are also occurring in the backdrop of sustained hate campaigning against certain religious groups on social media.
Hence, we call on you to take decisive action under the law to bring to book elements which are responsible for instigating religious hatred and violence in the Kandy District and also in other areas. We emphasize the need to take action not only against those who directly participate in such violence, but in particular, against those who instigate and provide organizational strength for such violence.
In this regard we wish to urge the Government to take action against such elements under section 3 of the International Covenant, on Civil and Political Rights Act No. 56 of 2007 which recognizes that anyone who propagates war or advocates national, racial or religious hatred that constitutes incitement to discrimination, hostility or violence or aids or abets such acts is guilty of an offence.
The Commission is firmly of the view that if swift and decisive action is not taken against those responsible for sectarian violence, such incidents will not only continue but will escalate.

Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka

JO wants Bill presented in Parliament again
	
Joint Opposition MP Dinesh Gunawardane said yesterday the passing of the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance Bill was not valid and requested the Speaker to present it to Parliament again.
He told parliament that Foreign Affairs Minister Thilak Marapana assured the House when the Bill was presented in parliament that the debate on the Bill would be held the following day as well but the government took up the voting for the Bill without keeping its word.
"It is a sad scenario to get a Bill passed in parliament in that manner when new Standing Orders had also been passed in parliament. The minister promised us that the debate on the Bill would be held for two days and introduce an amendment to it within that period," he said.
He said the amendment brought in to the Bill during the committee stage had not been given to the MPs and that it was a violation of SOs and parliament tradition.
He also said the amendment had not been given in Tamil which was necessary according to SOs and added that a debate on the Bond Commission report was adjourned due to non-availability of the Tamil translation.
He said when the subject minister, speaker and the Parliament Secretary General admitted the non-availability of the Tamil translation of the amendment, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, who came in a hurry, withdrew the amendment presented by the subject minister.
He said that during the arguments over the matter, the Speaker took a voting for the Bill in violation of the standing orders and added that the voting was not valid.
He said several JO MPs did not get a chance to speak during the debate and requested the speaker to present the Bill again in parliament to make it valid.
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya informed parliament that he would discuss the matter at the party leaders meeting held yesterday. (Ajith Siriwardana)

Judging conjugal compatibility at a glance
	

Most people in our country believe in Astrology. They make it a point to observe Astrological guidelines in fixing times for all important events in life and also when taking decisions on very vital matters like marriage.
In countries in the Orient like Sri Lanka and India, marriage is considered as something sacrosanct  an inviolable sacred bond. People attach so much importance to marriage; they look on ones success in marriage as ones very success in life.
Therefore, even young couples in love, when it comes to the question of marriage, would want to find out whether their horoscopes are matching. They would want an astrologer to match the `Porondamas (Astrological determinants of conjugal compatibility) to ascertain whether their marriage would be a success. Matching of `Porondamas which people refer to as `Porondam Gelapeema in Sinhala is a widespread practice prevalent in our society. However, there are certain astrological factors that enable a quick and accurate appraisal of the compatibility of horoscopes of a couple seeking matrimony.
Following are some of the astrological factors that serve as determinants of conjugal compatibility.
Natives of Taurus, Scorpio and Aquarius would make ideal partners of Aries, Cancer, Libra, and Capricorn natives.
	Gemini, Libra and Aquarius natives would be compatible partners for natives of fiery signs of Aries, Leo and Sagittarius.
	Natives of watery signs of Cancer, Scorpio and Pisces would make good partners for natives of the earthy signs of Taurus, Virgo and Capricorn.
	Those born into fiery signs of Aries, Leo and Sagittarius are not compatible with those born into Watery signs of Cancer, Scorpio and Pisces.
	The couple seeking matrimony would be an ideal match if they have been born into the same Lagna or if one persons 5th sign happens to be the others 9th or the 3rd sign is the other persons 11th sign.
	If the sign which Sun occupies in one horoscope is the sign where Moon occupies in the horoscope of the other, their marriage would be a great success.
	If the sign in which Mars is posited in one horoscope is the same where Venus occupies in the other horoscope, their marriage would be a lasting strong bond.
	Venus occupying a sign owned by Mars in one horoscope while Mars occupying a sign owned by Venus in the other horoscope is a favourable position signifying a successful marriage. In fact, two young people, a boy and a girl with such a planetary position in their horoscopes would fall in love at first sight, say astrologers.
	Closer the Sun and Moon to Jupiter or Venus, the better position is. It is favourable if they are posited in trines to each other. If the Sun in one horoscope is posited in conjunction with Mars in the same sign as in the others horoscope their union would be a success.
	The most important thing to ascertain in matching two horoscopes is whether the couple seeking matrimony would remain devoted and faithful to each other until death puts them asunder. The other important factor that should be determined is whether the couple is mentally and physically fit to enjoy conjugal happiness. Another important factor to be ascertained is whether marriage would result in the birth of fortunate children.

Kandy violence leads tourists to cancel visits
	
The religious and communal violence that erupted in Kandy could end up stymying the momentum built up in the tourism industry over the past three months, as signs are emerging that foreign tourists are cancelling their visits to Sri Lanka.
Over 80 tourists have cancelled their bookings made at one of the top three travel companies in Sri Lanka, which could possibly amount to a loss of 800 nights, Mirror Business learns.
This is despite the Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority (SLTDA) constantly issuing updates on the situation, and working with tourism stakeholders and the police to ensure the safety of tourists in the Central district.
Attempts to reach the top management of most of the leading travel companies and the two apex industry bodiesSri Lanka Association of Inbound Tour Operators (SLAITO) and The Hotels Association of Sri Lanka (THASL) were unsuccessful, as most were in attendance at ITB Berlin, the largest travel trade show in the world.
Back home, SLTDA Chairman Kavan Ratnayake hit back strongly against individuals and groups inciting religious and ethnic tension.
This is a wakeup call that shows the significance and the gravity of immature action on the part of those who contributed to this situation. The next time before someone throws a stone, or engages in any kind of road-rage, they should think ten times of the wide-ranging economic consequences of their actions, he said.
Ratnayake said that the tourism industry is projected to be the leading foreign exchange earner for Sri Lanka in two years, and the society should understand the importance of preserving a peaceful environment to sustain the growth of the industry.
The loss of income affects not only the major hotels, but also the street seller, the tuk-tuk driver, the farmer and the restaurant worker, he added.
The tourism industry was just getting back into gear after 2017 turned out to be a disappointment with a partial airport closure and a dengue epidemic, which resulted in nearly flat growth.
Relatively moderate growth last December was followed up by double-digit growth in January and February this year from key markets due to the winter season and the Chinese New Year, before the current tension in the major tourism hub of Kandy spurted.
Sparks flew with a roadside brawl over a truck driver thwarting a three-wheeler from overtaking, which resulted in the latter assaulting the truck driver who passed away from the wounds sustained.
The incident escalated into communal violence, with residents of the area fanning flames of religious hatred over the fact that the truck driver was Buddhist and the assailants were Muslim.
Another death of a Muslim resulted in the ensuing chaos.
Foreign media provided wide coverage on the developments, and the US, British, UAE and Australian governments issued travel advisories for their residents visiting Sri Lanka.
However, the national carrier SriLankan Airlines, which flies most of the tourists to Sri Lanka, issued a statement, which said that it has yet to see a massive cancellation trend.
There could be some cancellations. We are closely monitoring the situation, but so far we are unaffected, SriLankan said.
A source within the airline yesterday said that it would take a day or two before the airline could state whether cancellations have substantially increased due to the situation.
The unrest would not only result in cancellations by tourists who were set to visit Sri Lanka shortly, but would also discourage potential bookings for the coming months. (Chandeepa Wettasinghe)

KNOW YOUR THYROID
	

Patients with various thyroid disorders generally consult General (Internal) Physicians. Some of them dont have classical symptoms and signs of thyroid disease hence strong clinical judgment is needed to arrive at the diagnosis.

Its believed that at least 10% of the population will develop a thyroid condition during their lifetime. More than half of the patients with thyroid disease are unaware of their condition. Women are five to eight times more likely than men to have thyroid problems. The causes of thyroid problems are largely unknown. Undiagnosed thyroid disease may put patients at risk for certain serious conditions, such as cardiovascular diseases, osteoporosis and infertility. Pregnant women with undiagnosed or inadequately treated hypothyroidism have an increased risk of miscarriage, preterm delivery and severe developmental problems, the latter of course during childhood. Most thyroid diseases are lifelong conditions that can be managed with medical attention.

What is the thyroid
The thyroid derives its name from the Latin word meaning shield. 
The thyroid is located in the anterior lower neck just in front of the wind pipe (trachea). The normal thyroid consists of two lobes placed lateral to the trachea that are connected by tissue called, called the isthmus. 
The thyroid functions as an endocrine organ or gland. The thyroid gland produces hormones and secretes them into the blood where they circulate and later bind with specific target tissue. The thyroid secretes L - thyroxine (T4), 
L - triiodothyronine (T3) and calcitonin. 
In humans 80 to 90 percent of the thyroid hormone produced and released is T4 while the remainder is T3. 

What is TSH
This is the most common test in clinical practice to detect thyroid disease. The pituitary gland produces TSH which circulates to the thyroid gland where it binds onto the thyroid cells to control production and release the thyroid hormones, T4 and T3. These increases in thyroid hormone are sensed by the pituitary and hypothalamus, leading to an acceptable or satisfactory amount of T4/T3. When TSH production drops, lower levels of TSH are detected by the thyroid, leading to release of less T4/T3. The levels of T4 and TSH are inversely related. If the thyroid hormone levels are low, the pituitary pumps out more TSH causing the thyroid to make more T4 leading to higher blood T4 which in turn tells the pituitary to decrease TSH secretion. Similarly, if T4 levels are elevated for any reason, the pituitary responds by shutting off TSH secretion, leading to low or suppressed TSH levels in the blood. In most cases of hypothyroidism with low levels of T4 and T3, very high level of TSH is seen. Similarly, TSH level is very low in hyperthyroidism with elevated T4 and T3. 

What are functions of thyroid hormones
The thyroid hormones act on nearly every cell in the body. They act to increase the basal metabolic rate, affect protein synthesis, help to regulate long bone growth and maturation of neurons. The thyroid hormones are essential for proper development and differentiation of all cells of the human body. 

What are the common thyroid disorders
Hypothyroidism 
	Hyperthyroidism 
	Thyroid nodules 
	Thyroid cancer 

What is hypothyroidism
Hypothyroidism is a condition in which the thyroid gland doesnt produce enough thyroid hormones. Women, especially those older than 60 years, are more likely to develop hypothyroidism. 
In most cases the thyroid gland is not enlarged. It seldom causes symptoms in the early stages and needs strong clinical judgment to arrive at the diagnosis. 
There are many causes of hypothyroidism. They include conditions in which antibodies are formed against thyroid, treatment for hyperthyroidism, thyroid surgery, radiation therapy and some medications. 
In patients with fully developed hypothyroidism, following signs and symptoms are seen 

Fatigue 
	Intolerance to cold 
	Constipation 
	Dry skin 
	Weight gain 
	Hoarseness 
	Muscle aches 
	Heavy menstrual periods 
	Thinning hair 
	Impaired memory 
	Slowed heart rate 
The diagnosis of hypothyroidism is made by detecting elevated TSH level and reduced T4 and T 3 levels. In most patients long-term treatment with thyroid hormones is needed as the therapy. 

What ishyperth- yroidism
Hyperthyroidism is a condition in which the thyroid gland is overactive and produces excessive amounts of thyroid hormone. When the thyroid gland is overactive the bodys processes speed up causing various symptoms and signs. The most common cause of hyperthyroidism is the Gravess disease in which body makes an antibody that causes the thyroid gland to make too much thyroid hormone. Hyperthyroidism also may be caused by a toxic nodular or multinodular goiter which are nodules in the thyroid gland that cause the thyroid to produce excessive amounts of thyroid hormones. 
Following are the common symptoms of hyperthyroidism. 
Fatigue 
	Tremors of hands 
	Sweating 
	Intolerance to heat
	Nervousness

Nela:   The film ends inconclusively, but much to appreciate
	
Adapting novels for the screen has always been tricky, and filmmakers all over the world have commonly got accused of departing from or distorting the original. Nela is an adaptation by filmmaker Bennet Ratnayake of a 19th century Spanish novel  Marianela by BenitoPerez Galdos.
Despite criticism of departure from the original, the director has succeeded in capturing the essence of the story, which is wild and hopeless romance resulting in inevitable tragedy. The film ends inconclusively, but theres much to appreciate before we get there.
Nela is an orphaned young girl disfigured by a childhood accident. She is in love with a handsome young man blind from birth. Nela in the film is played by Shalani Tharaka. Unfortunately, Udara Ratnayake as the handsome, wealthy prince of her dreams is not really effective, and looks blind not just to his surroundings but to the possibilities in his life, too. This makes him the odd man out in an otherwise excellence cast  Roshan Pilapitiya, Semini Iddamalgoda, Thumindu Dodantenne, Udari Perera, Tharuka Wanniarachchi and Palitha Silva - a gifted and experienced actor who unfortunately has not had enough opportunities on the silver screen.
The film is visually a feast to the eye. Set in a colonial era tea plantation, the visuals are sometimes breathtaking, and both indoor and outdoor light has been captured lovingly by cinematographer Ruwan Costa. The musical score by Suresh Maliyadda, though often repetitive, complements the films overall romantic mood while departing into sub moods of despair and anxiety as the story unfolds. The editing feels a bit haphazard, but this may have something to do with the directors preference for relatively static shot compositions and lengthy scenes. 
The screenplay was written by the director, along with the dialogue. While the latter can sound a little starchy at times, he should be given credit for his ethnic sensitivity  the Tamil plantation workers speak in Tamil, with Sinhala sub titles, which could be a first for a Sinhala film though that needs to be verified. It is certainly rare. 
There is too, a discussion of William Wordsworths poetry and the nature of beauty (a hot topic for 18th and 19th century Romantics), and that puts the dialogue in a class of its own, for one can think of only a very few Sri Lankan film makers who would dare discuss Wordsworth in a film  if they have read any Wordsworth to begin with. Its a nice cosmopolitan touch in an artistic culture which is increasingly overwhelmed by the rude essentials of survival, titillation and subject matter of gossip columns. To mention Wordsworth, or Shakespeare or Lao Tse should not be taken as an exercise in cultural high mindedness. It is rather an attempt to stay in touch with a wider world which we have lost.
Cinema is mass entertainment, and it is sad to see such a poor spectator reaction to Nela. To class Bennet Ratnayake as a commercial film maker (in the same vein as Udayakantha Warnasuriya) is to do him an injustice. Nor is he an intellectual film maker like Asoka Handagama. Though he has made only three features so far, starting from Aswesuma in 2001, he has made a considerable number of good tele dramas (with his own production house) and belongs to the pantheon of our notable film makers. He should be lauded for his hard labour and honest efforts. I still think his forte lies in the action film, as exemplified by Aswesuma. But he chose to follow a different path, selecting slowly unfolding stories, and that shows a certain artistic daring and a willingness to take risks.
But our film world is a wilderness, and he is still looking for an audience. This isnt a unique fate. One could say that Lester James Pieris, Dharmasena Pathiraja, Sugathapala Senarath Yapa, Wijeya Dharmasri, G. D. L. Perera, Manik Sandrasagara and Dharmasiri Bandaranaike were still looking for an audience after making so many films. There are those who argue that these directors always had their small but faithful audiences. But audiences have their politics and politics is a fickle thing. Audiences have lost touch too, with the meaning of beauty; this is a direct result of an entire generation who from the 1980s on were prevented from studying literature as a school subject. Reading some romantic poetry again could help rehabilitate a generation of lost spectators. 
But there is a more subtle kind of dramatic tension, borne of emotional conflict, which requires a more sophisticated viewer. When its done with less than artistic finesse, we have melodrama and endless family feuds (Dynasty is a famous example). When its handled with more finesse, we have films such as Lesters Ran Salu, Dharmasiri Bandaranaikes Hansa Wilak, Pathirajas Bambaru Ewith or Manik Sandrasagaras Kalu Diya Dahara. We can include Nelu in the same category. 
The film has its defects and there are moments when the finely woven thread of dramatic tension is lost in the film. But there are two powerful episodes  the scene where eye surgery is performed, and the scene of domestic violence in toddy tapper Ramaswamys house. That is very good cinema. But it takes a more sensitive spectator than the average we have today to appreciate that. Such dulled sensibilities are an inevitable product of neo-liberal economic and cultural policy, which tries to provide everything in the SMS format at inflated prices.
The film has its defects and there are moments when the finely woven thread of dramatic tension is lost. But there are two powerful episodes  the scene where eye surgery is performed, and the scene of domestic violence in toddy tapper Ramaswamys house
What is it about Nela that puts off these dull spectators Silly love stories about young love draw crowds. Nela too, is a story of young love. The rich boy and poor girl formula has had considerable success all over the world. But in this case the hero is blind and the girl disfigured. Does that disgust the neo-liberal spectator, weaned on endless beauty products Surely, this stupid girl doesnt buy lipstick. She cant afford it and doesnt need it, anyway. Even if she has make up on, that coot is blind and cant see it. So whats the point Or can love blossom only at the MC, and wont happen in a tea plantation
Heaven (along with the architects of neo-liberal thinking) only knows. If they remain insensitive and unwilling to risk their rupees to see a film like Nela (rupees spent so willingly at McDonalds and the like), sensitive and artistically bold film makers shall always be condemned to live in this wilderness.

## Title: On arthritis, osteoporosis, spondylitis and much more...

On arthritis, osteoporosis, spondylitis and much more...
	

What is the difference between inflammatory arthritis and non-inflammatory arthritis What does it mean when someone has osteoporosis in contrast to osteoarthritis Is spondylitis different from spondylosis Why do some have rheumatoid arthritis and others rheumatic fever Is medical terminology confusing you especially when it comes to joint disease/ rheumatology In the following article I will explain some of the medical tongue twisters that had baffled patients for decades!
First lets analyse the word arthritis. Arth refers to a joint in Greek language. itismeans inflammation of any part of the body. Therefore, arthritis refers to inflammation of joints. What is inflammation Simply, this is swelling of a part of the body with excessive blood supply to that region. There are four features seen during inflammation which are redness, increase in warmth, pain and swelling. This was explained way back in first century AD by Roman scholar Celsus using the terms rubor(redness), calor(warmeth), dolar(pain),tumor(swelling).
But does the term arthritis always mean inflammation of joints in the modern era Unfortunately, not. We now tend to use this term for anything that relates to joint disease. For an example there is a variety of non-inflammatory arthritis called osteoarthritis as well. So what is non inflammatory arthritis This is when a patient has a joint related condition causing agony without swelling, redness and warmth. Osteoarthritis which was previously known as wear and tear arthritis is the best example for non-inflammatory arthritis. Nevertheless, there is a considerable amount of overlap in these conditions and every patient has to be assessed for their unique joint ailment. There are numerous ways of treating osteoarthritis. The hallmark of this condition is loss of cartilage between the bones (or knees).
When this happens the shock absorbent properties of especially joints like the knees, hips are lost. Finally bone grinds against bone and causes very severe pain. Contrary to the popular belief there are many ways to stop this process of osteoarthritis. Some methods do not involve tablets or injections.
Osteo refers to bone. Porosis is a porous condition where the bone loosed its natural strength. Hence osteoporosis is weak and brittle bone without its normal strength to withstand shock. Osteoporosis is a common condition in the elderly population of Sri Lanka. The ideal way of diagnosing osteoporosis is to do a bone density scan called DXA scan. Depending on the test results we start the patients on tablets like Alendronate to strengthen the bone. Do you recall seeing hunched back elderly struggling to mobilise themselves with walking sticks Unfortunately, these patients have severe osteoporosis with multiple wedge fractures of their spine making their back C shaped. There are ways to prevent osteoporosis as well. A good diet enriched in calcium and Vitamin D, plenty of exercise and skin being exposed to sunlight are some of these methods. The DXA scan now an essential screening test in the elderly, can also detect osteo-penia. Penia refers to lack of or deficiency. Osteopenia is not so bad as osteoporosis. Osteopenia could be easily treated with calcium and vitamin D supplements. Then what is Osteomalacia This is softening of bones due to Vitamin D deficiency. Symptoms are bone pain and muscle weakness. Again treatment involves Vitamin D supplements.
Spondy is spine. As I mentioned above it is is inflammation. So spondylitis is inflammation of the spine. Although inflammation in ancient medical terms refer to redness, warmth, pain and swelling, when it happens in the spine almost all of the features cannot be seen externally. But similar to inflammation of a joint, the entire spine can undergo a change. Out of several varieties of spondylitis ankylosing spondylitis is a popular disease. Akylosis is fusion of bones. So ankylosing spondylitis is where the spine bones undergo both inflammation and fusion. For spondylitis which is seen more in males than females, we treat with anti-inflammatory medication and disease modifying drugs. As the longer the inflammation is, the more damage the spine receives. Spondylitis sometimes runs in the family. And can involve other joints like hips, knees or fingers. So how does spondylosis differ from spondylitis Osis is problem or disease. So spondylosis is a problem of the spine. Cervical spondylosis is a condition affecting the neck part of the spine. Lumbar spondylosis is when the lower back region is affected. In spondylosis the spinal bones (vertebrae) undergo significant wear and tear. And then this begins to affect close by nerves causing symptoms.
Rheumatoid arthritis and rheumatic fever are two different conditions. Rheumatoid arthritis, as the name implies, affects the joints and causes inflammation. Rheumatic fever is a condition affecting almost several areas in the body after an infection. In rheumatic fever, joint pain/swelling is seen for a limited time, but there are certain other features like heart involvement, skin nodules, rashes, fever and abnormal body movements called chorea. This condition prevails mainly in children and young adults. The treatment is completely different from whats used for rheumatoid arthritis. Rheumatoid arthritis is the commonest inflammatory arthritis in the world affecting more women than men. This produces symmetrical joint pain/swelling and on the long run causes deformed/crooked joints. Hand, wrist, elbow, shoulder and knee involvement is common. Early morning pain in the joints and stiffness lasting for one hour or more is characteristic of rheumatoid arthritis. Sometimes when I inquire into past events of patients, they come up with a history of childhood rheumatic fever and penicillin antibiotic treatment. I make it a point to explain that rheumatic fever bears no relationship to rheumatoid arthritis.
Finally, to conclude this article on an interesting note, I would like to pose our readers a question as to what disease did the Hunchback of Notre Dame have You might have read this famous novel by Victor Hugo. So was Hunchback (named Quasimodo) a true person What really caused the main character in this novel, to have a hunched back/spine There is an interesting debate among medical professionals regarding this. First of all, it is thought that Victor Hugo was inspired by a stone mason who was working at Notre Dame cathedral to write this world famous classic. That stone mason had a disease causing a hunched back. And also a skin condition with polyps covering his eyelids. An abnormally shaped disfigured head. There are three possibilities for Quasimodo s hunched back, which are osteoporosis (causing a spinal hump named Dowagers hump), tuberculosis of the spine (Potts disease) and neurofibromatosis. Out of these three neurofibromatosis is the condition which the stone mason (and the hunch back of Notre Dame) was thought to have! Neurofibromatosis causes the disfigured spine/ skull and also the skin protrusions/ polyps.

Paying bills nobodys baby
	

This holiday resort located in an ancient kingdom has for some time become the haunt of the lackeys of a leading politico.

Now a question has arisen as to who should foot the electricity and the water bills of this holiday home which have run into hefty amounts.
The state establishment which owns the holiday home has refused to settle the bills saying that they did not use the place for its guests during the period relevant to the outstanding water and electricity bills.
Neither the leading politico nor his lackeys who had been enjoying the full free run of the place had come forward to pay the bills.
By the way, the CEB which would not normally fail to serve the ordinary electricity consumers with the red notice even if the dues have not run into arrears for more than a month or two, has yet to issue such red notice warning to the authorities responsible for running this holiday home despite that the dues had already run into arrears amounting to several lakhs of rupees, they say.

Electing a chair for a local body in an area of Digamadulla fame has reportedly run into an unexpected deadlock with a ladylove of an influential Diyawanna politico entering the fray.

The ambitious fair ones bid to grab the chair over the heads of several seniors well qualified for the post is likely to cause an unnecessary delay in activating this local body which has won a Swarna Purawara award about two years ago, they say.

Singapore reminds Sri Lanka that development is no illusion
	
Singapore today
Singaporean Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loongs recent visit to Sri Lanka enlightened us on several major issues affecting us. It was of significance that the signing of several trade agreements between the two countries took place during his visit. His visit to Sri Lanka could be viewed as an opportunity to strengthen bilateral trade and economic relations and goodwill between the two countries and also to open up vast new fields for trade and investments beneficial to Sri Lanka. The Singaporean Prime Minister met the business community and the investors in Sri Lanka and held talks on their future plans for development. 
His visit was of great significance in that it was for the first time after 13 years that a Singaporean prime minister visited Sri Lanka. It would be more beneficial to Sri Lankan than to Singapore, because the two counties have a world of difference. This difference had been vice versa about 50 years ago and its the political lesson that we must learn from Singapore. 
In Singapore the law is strictly enforced in every sphere, but the police arent deployed to discipline people. Offenders, in the case of a breach of the law, are detected throughCCTV cameras
Its said that politics is an art in which truth and deceit are interwoven and they become powerful each in turn. Unless we do not distinguish between the real and the unreal, the future well-being of the society would be in jeopardy. The need to be free from this destructive political illusion and to have a people friendly political culture is being felt more than ever today. If we could see through this illusion and experience reality, it would be a political lesson well learned. 
We must judge this interpretation in the light of a review of the much talked about old topic Singapore and Sri Lanka. Much has been talked and written about this popular theme in the economic and political history of Sri Lanka, particularly when referring to development. Economic development is a topic that has been subject to different interpretations of the rulers of successive Governments since independence. Our basic problem is that we take much time to realize the difference between their talk and the extent of their achievements. We realize that we have been suffering from an illusion only when we experience its consequences. The objectives of politicians and their limitations regarding development differ from the expectations of the people who voted them into power. 
Its said that politics is an art in which truth and deceit are interwoven and they become powerful each in turn. Unless we do not distinguish between the real and the unreal
Lagging far behind 
This popular theme of discussions namely Singapore and Sri Lanka can be used to distinguish between illusion and reality in the field of development. Former Singaporean Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew has gone down in the annals of history as a great ruler who led Singapore along the right path to development. His statement in 1950 that he wished Singapore was a Sri Lanka would be of great significance to us islanders today. We can imagine from this statement the condition of Singapore at that time. Today we have a clear perspective of the progress achieved by Singapore which is beyond imagination. After 67 years, we are ashamed to find that Sri Lankas development has lagged far behind and today we have to take Singapore as an example when developing our country. 
Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong
The total area of Singapore is 720 square kilometres and the population is 5.5 million. However, the per capita real income of the country today nearly exceeds that of the United Kingdom or the United States. How did Singapore, which had been a fisheries colony and a safe haven of robbers and thieves prior to 1950, revolutionize its socio economic conditions and achieve its present development Its imperative that we have a clear perspective of it, to make a factual analysis of Sri Lankas development process. 
Another factor of Singapores development is the measures against corruption and malpractices. It is a matter of serious concern that in Sri Lanka corruption and malpractice prevail from top to bottom and it has retarded the countrys development
Sri Lanka is a country rich in natural resources. Vast stretches of paddy fields, forest reserves and environmental zones rich in bio-diversity adorn the county. From the North to the South and from the West to the East the land is fertile and rich in water resources. A seed just thrown away would grow without any care or attention and bear fruit. However, Singapore, a country sans any natural resources or fertile land, made a pragmatic approach to development in a short time.

The historic statement of the outgoing Singaporean Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew was of great importance in any analysis of our development process. Replying to a query from the media whether he praised anyone for the miraculous development in the country, he quipped that he owed much to the leftist politicians in Sri Lanka. He said he was prompted to construct a harbour in Singapore to provide bunking facilities to ships sailing round the world when the Colombo habour was constantly crippled due to trade union actions led by leftist politicians and that it was the beginning of Singapores development. 
Today we have a clear perspective of the progress achieved by Singapore which is beyond imagination. After 67 years, we are ashamed to find that Sri Lankas development has lagged far behind and today we have to take Singapore as an example when developing our country
Visionary leadership 
The visionary leadership of Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yu brought about that miraculous development in Singapore. The unstinted courage, determination and dedication of the Singaporean people were largely instrumental in his endeavour. 
Its worthwhile to study the factors that raised Singapore to the rank of a developed country in the world and how Sri Lanka adopted them in its development process. With this in view, it is pertinent that we take an example from Singapore, when there is gathering momentum about the need of an effective development plan for Sri Lanka. The strict enforcement of laws and the peoples respect for the countrys legal system were major factors that led to the fast development in Singapore.
Singaporeans are extremely lawful. Its a matter of concern that we have to consider Sri Lankans as far behind when compared to the people of Singapore. Singaporeans take pleasure to abide by law and never resort to illegal activities. Law breaking is considered a shameful act that irks their conscience. It is sad that Sri Lankans uphold the law only in fear of a possible police action and not because it is their duty as law binding citizens. They use the Zebra crossing only if a police officer is on duty, or else they cross the road haphazardly at any point. In fact one must, like citizens in other developed countries, obey his or her conscience rather than the command of the police officer. 
In Singapore the law is strictly enforced in every sphere, but the police arent deployed to discipline people. Offenders, in the case of a breach of the law, are detected through CCTV cameras. The offenders are subject to deterrent punishment. A smoker, smoking in a public place, is liable to a fine of SGD 1000. Whipping and the death sentence are still in force in Singapore. However, the people dont resort to campaigns against punishments. 
Its of significance that in addition to the deterrent punishments, the Singapore Government has provided adequate facilities to citizens to uphold the law. In Sri Lanka drunken driving is a punishable offence, but no facilities are available for a man under the influence of liquor to transport himself. In Singapore taxi services are in operation round the clock. 
Well maintained environment 
Singapore is a country with a well maintained environment free of garbage. This has been largely possible due to the peoples respect for the law and the need to maintain discipline. It is important that a sense of responsibility should be inculcated in children from their formative years through the school curriculum. 
Another factor of Singapores development is the measures against corruption and malpractices. It is a matter of serious concern that in Sri Lanka corruption and malpractice prevail from top to bottom and it has retarded the countrys development. One may resort to frauds for want of an adequate income to meet the bare needs. The Government of Singapore considers it a paramount duty to pay an adequate salary to everyone in the state administration, including the ministers. 
Another glaring defect in the Sri Lankan administrative system is that any offender can make a plea against charges. For example the individuals who were accused of malpractice in issuing Sil Redi (Clothes to observe Sil) made a plea against the case stating that they only carried out the orders of the superiors. Its an international law that evens the President, as the senior most official in the state machinery, should not resort to irregularities. Newburg International Judiciary passed this law when those during Hitlers time who were engaged in war crimes took up the position that they carried out the orders of their leader. It is sad that a Presidential Secretary was ignorant about this international law. However the law has no place for ignorance. 
Lack of consensus among institutions involved in decision making is another glaring defect in Sri Lankas development effort. Quite often decisions taken in parliament are declared null and void by court and vice versa the decisions of the judiciary by the President. All institutions involved in decision making should join hands and take undisputable decisions. 
Its a turn of fate that Singapore that followed Sri Lanka and developed the country has offered to open up paths to development in Sri Lanka. Truth and illusion play different roles in politics and development. The value of local investments in Sri Lanka by last July was more than US$ 530 million. Singapore is the fourth largest investor in Sri Lanka with more than 100 investors. 
It is a fact that we need a benevolent despot to give leadership to the forward march of the country. His decisions should be acceptable to the whole country and be free of communal, religious or political differences. He must not hesitate to take stern decisions in the interest of the country leaving it to the future generations to decide on their correctness. 
I strongly believe that President J.R.Jayewardene was the only visionary leader the county has had since independence. It was during his time that the accelerated Mahaweli Development Programme, Mahapola Scholorship Programme and the open economy were implemented and the country was led along the right path to development. However, his failure to resolve the ethnic problem resulted in obstacles in implementing his development programmes. Despite his five sixth majorities in parliament, he faced obstacles due to his failure to create public awareness on the essence of his decisions. 
Sri Lankas development has been stagnating for more than half a century for want of a benevolent despot of the calibre of Lee Kuan Yew, Mahathir Mohamed, or Nelson Mandela who took stern decisions and passed hard-hearted laws and educated the masses to strictly adhere to them, but not burdening them with any kind of hardship. Nations which are struggling have no alternative, but to look at the developed countries and repent their errors. 
The Prime Minister of Singapore has been destined to visit Sri Lanka and sign a free trade agreement between the two countries. It is imperative that as Sri Lankans, even of late, must be determined to change their attitudes and lay the foundation for a dynamic approach to development.

Syria regime pummels besieged Eastern Ghouta
	

HAMMURIYEH AFP March 8, 2018- Syrian forces pursued a relentless air and ground offensive against Eastern Ghouta on Thursday, moving closer to retaking the rebel enclave but also depriving desperate civilians of vital aid. 
More than 900 civilians have been killed in the nearly three-week assault on the last rebel enclave outside the capital, where dozens suffered overnight from a suspected chlorine attack. 
On another front in Syrias complex seven-year war, pro-Turkey rebels seized control of the key northern town of Jandairis from Kurdish fighters. 
Russia-backed government forces have retaken more than half of Eastern Ghouta, a monitor says, since launching their devastating offensive on the enclave on February 18. 
An aid delivery planned for Thursday to bring relief to war-weary civilians inside Eastern Ghouta, could not go through.

Trump accepts offer to meet Kim Jong Un
	
US President Donald Trump has agreed to meet with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, setting the scene for a historic, unprecedented encounter, the CNN said today.
The meeting, which would be the first between a sitting US President and a North Korean leader, will happen by May, according to South Korea's national security adviser, Chung Eui-yong, who delivered the invitation to Trump after a visit by his delegation to Pyongyang earlier this week.
The South Korean delegation, which landed in Washington, D.C. for a debriefing Thursday on the North-South talks, was careful to praise Trump's influence over the developments. Chung said the US President's "leadership" and his administration's pressure on the North Korean regime had "brought us to this juncture."
White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said in a statement that Trump "greatly appreciates the nice words" of the delegation and South Korean President Moon Jae-in.
"He will accept the invitation to meet with Kim Jong Un anda place and time to be determined. We look forward to the denuclearization of North Korea. In the meantime, all sanctions and maximum pressure must remain."
The North Korean leader had told the South Koreans "he is committed to denuclearization" and pledged that North Korea will "refrain from any further nuclear or missile tests," Chung said.
Kim also told the South Koreans he understands that the US and South Korea would move forward with their joint military exercises later this year.

Using a nerve agent on UK soil appalling and reckless: Theresa May
	

Theresa May today branded an attempt to kill a Russian double agent with a nerve agent an appalling and reckless crime.
The Prime Minister said she would do what is right if it was proven the Kremlin was responsible for the attempt on Sergei Skripals life.
She hinted at support for expelling the Russian ambassador if the case was proven.
Mrs Mays new intervention came after the police confirmed a rare nerve agent was used in the attempted assassination in Salisbury on Sunday.
Home Secretary Amber Rudd updated MPs on the latest steps in the investigation in the Commons today.
She said it was an outrageous crime and using a nerve agent on British soil was a brazen and reckless act that was attempted murder in the most cruel and reckless way. 
The Home Secretary urged caution on speculation about who is responsible.
The Prime Minister said: First of all the police are still investigating, obviously, we need to let the police have the space and time to conduct their investigating so that we get the best possible evidence of what has happened in this
particular case.
Of course if action needs to be taken then the government will do that.
Asked if she would expel the ambassador, Mrs May said: We will do what is appropriate, we will do what is right, if it is proved to be the case that this is State sponsored.

Villachchiya villagers fear drought will worsen
	
The withering coconut trees, the barren paddy fields that have remained uncultivated for four consecutive seasons and dried up tank beds describe the situation in Villachchiya.All whats happening is like a curse spreading over the entire village and its surroundings and has left the people living in hunger. 
People in Villachchiya hardly have three meals a day. Parents often stay hungry leaving the available food for their children. We are living in extreme difficulty and have no means of income. 
According to him the Irrigation Department emptied the Mahavillachchiya major reservoir of its water in 2015 by breaking the dam for rehabilitation work. But the restoring work still continues. Since the beginning of this restoration work there hasnt been sufficient rain in the catchment area to fill the tank. 
About 5,000 families are living in this farmer settlement.Their main livelihood comes from cultivation. But today they are experiencing a very difficult time since farmers havent been able to do any cultivation.
Government servants and businessmen can hardly be found in this area. Therefore people in the area are mostly retail traders and those engaged in odd jobs. Whatever their professions they are all in a precariousfinancial situation.

Despite these hardship farmers in Villachchiya have adapted to the hard way of living. 
If there is paddy we wouldnt go hungry, but during past few years hardly a single bag of paddy was brought to farmers homes from our fields. Even our elder children arent in a position to help us as they are also experiencing the same difficulties, is how 70-year-old S.Dingiri Menika, a mother of two daughters, describe the precarious situation she is faced with. She is a resident at No 358 Thulana Left Bank.
Just a single tube well
The water provided to the villagers by a bowser is used by the villagers only for washing purposes. For bathing purposes the villagers have to depend on the only tube well that exists in the area. 
The villagers say that they have to bring drinking water from a distant shop. The situation in all 13 Thulanas in the Villachchiya Divisional Secretariat is the same. 
I wonder whether this is a spell which has been caused as a reaction to neglecting the performing of rituals relevant to agriculture, even at the national level
R.M.S.Ekanayaka
The Chairman of the Mahavillachchiya Combined Farmer Organisations R.M.S.Ekanayaka claimed that the declining of the under ground water level has worsened the drought situation. He also attributed cause of the low underground water level to the emptying of Villachchiya tank at an
inappropriate time. 
Villachchiya farmers havent experienced a drought of this nature in the farmer settlement area since it was set up in the 1950s. I wonder whether this is a spell which has been caused as a reaction to neglecting the performing of rituals relevant to agriculture, even at the national level, Ekanayaka said.
 
Distributioncanal dry
People were never exposed to such a terrible situation during past climatic extremes as edibles like manioc and other varieties of yams were available for consumption. But this time the drought has spared nothing in the area and we cant quell our hunger. The distribution canal flowing around my farm is completely dry, he said. 
I was able to do some vegetable cultivation labouring hard. But all will be in vain if the April rains fail to come, he said. 
H.B. Dayawathi (60) is a female belonging to a farmer family living in the same village. She had a different explanation for the frustrating situation that the villagers are experiencing. 
A. Kapurubanda, another farmer in the village, viewed the catastrophe in the area as a rural economist would. 
When there is no cultivation all activities in the village come to a standstill. This is because the base of livelihood in these remote areas is cultivation, is how Kapurubanda express the situation as an experienced farmer.  I am living with my children and grandchildren. We already feel hungry and the fear of thirst is on the way, he said with concerns. He felt so worried about the future.
I am living with my children and grandchildren. We already feel hungry and the fear of thirst is on the way
A. Kapurubanda
The whole village seems to be in disarray and with work coming to a standstill. Here and there one can see half-built houses where construction has come to a stop. Boutiques are abandoned and arid paddy fields in the surrounding areas indicate that the economy is depressed. The whole area is deserted as most of the males have left for urban areas in search of employment, mostly in construction sites as labourers. 
U. Jayatisssa said that living here in the village is very difficult. Many villagers have left the village to earn a living and sustain their families while women have gone to Trade Zones seeking jobs. 
M.Nandawathi in Oyamaduwa said that she had returned home sometime back after finding employment at a private company in the Katunayaka FreeTrade Zone. 
According to the Manager of the Anuradhapura District Disaster Management Unit Deshapriya Bandara, drinking water is provided to about 3,000 drought affected families in Villachchiya daily, free of charge. However the resources from where the water is coming from is on the verge of drying up. This water is supplied by the National Water Supply and Drainage Board. As rains arent expected till the end of the year the authorities are expected to continue providing water to the drought effected areas using bowsers, he said. 
Meanwhile Divisional Secretary E.R. Thilakarathna said that they have considered the necessity to increase the monies paid as drought relief. He said that the necessary actions are in retrogress to this effect. 
The Divisional Secretary expressed the confidence of receiving drought relief for about 1,500 more families from the funds allocated to the Anuradhapura District. 
But the people in the areas like Villachchiya have already suffered more losses that cannot be compensated with government funds. Indebtedness, forfeiture of vehicles bought on lease, obstacles to the childrens education,lack of nutrition are major problems brought about by the drought, he said.

Waiting for the highest bid!
	

While the legal snags and other issues in the way of constituting newly elected local bodies are being resolved, the main political parties are reportedly in a race to buy members elected from minor political parties and independent groups in a bid to have their own nominee as the mayor or the chairperson.

By the way, it has been heard on the grapevine that two main political parties short of one member each to form a majority in a major local body close to Colombo have offered an amount as high as Rs. 1 million to hook a member elected from a minor party.
The member conscious of his bargaining power over two competing buyers is said to be marking time for the highest possible bid, they say.

What you should know about COPD
	

Surgeons today are coping with a large number of high risk respiratory patients. This may be due to prolonged life expectancy, increased prevalence of COPD or greater needs for invasive diagnostic procedures and surgical interventions.
Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a chronic inflammatory lung disease that causes obstructed airflow from lungs. According to Dr. Sumana Handagala, Consultant Thoracic Surgeon at the National Hospital for Respiratory Diseases, Welisara, certain patients with other respiratory diseases may also have COPD. Hence the prevalence of COPD in general surgical patients is 5-10% whereas for cardiac and thoracic patients it could be 10-12% and 40% respectively. 
Common risk factors
Some of the common risk factors of COPD include;
Excessive smoking
	Advanced age
	Cardiac/Pulmonary diseases
	High Blood Pressure
COPD is not only a risk to life, but it will also be a heavy economic burden as well, says Dr. Handagala, elaborating on the intensity of the illness. Prolonged hospital stay, ventilation and failure of other organs such as heart or renal failure may add to this burden, says the doctor. 
Complications
When one develops COPD, several lung related complications may arise. These include
More chance of pneumonia
	Lung collapse (segmental / lobar)
	Lung abscess
	Prolonged oxygen supplementation
	Acute Respiratory Distress syndrome 
	Refractory Bronchospasms 
	Lung burst  pneumothorax/Bronchopleural fistula

Preparing patients for surgery
Speaking further, Dr. Handagala said that when patients are getting ready for surgery, they need to be assessed and prepared accordingly. For emergency operations we may not have time to do a lengthy preparation. Whenever possible we take a chest physicians opinion regarding perioperative care of the patient.
The assessment may include Pulmonary Function Tests; Spirometry  where the lung function is measured, specifically the volume or flow of air that can be inhaled and exhaled or a more sophisticated DLCO Test  a test of the diffusing capacity of the lungs for Carbon Monoxide. An Arterial Blood Gas analysis could also be done which measures the amount of oxygen and carbon dioxide in blood. Other procedures include physiotherapy (percussion ,vibration, postural drainage and Inspiratory Muscle Strengthening), nebulisation, prescribing oral medicine and getting the patient to stop smoking for a few days. In addition to that assessment of the heart with an ECG and a 2D Echocardiogram should also be performed.

Planning a surgery for COPD patients
Before patients settle in for a surgery we should look at its absolute necessity, says Dr. Handagala. Without going in for an open surgery operation sometimes a patient could undergo a minimal access procedure such as a keyhole surgery. In addition to that there are other multi-model analgesic regimens such as combining different modes of painkillers. This not only reduces the Surgical Stress Response, but it also speeds up the physiologic recovery. Therefore patients only have to spend a short hospital stay. In addition to that there are smooth anaesthetic techniques which could be performed.

Post-operative care
Speaking further Dr. Handagala adds that pre-operatively educating the patient will make him or her mentally prepared for the surgery. They could be given physiotherapy and supported further. If not they will be in pain. Nebulisation could also be done in addition to lung recruitment manoeuvres. It is important that early mobilisation is done so that the patient can move around rather than being stationary. The patient should be pain free and therefore certain painkillers could be prescribed. Once the patient is discharged he should be given inhalers and a follow up needs to be done until he is fully healed. It would be best if the COPD follow up could be done by a chest physician, he says.

White House taken by Storm(y):
	

US, (Daccan Chronicle/reuters), Mar 8, 2018 -US President Donald Trump has won an arbitration proceeding against adult-film actress Stormy Daniels, his spokeswoman said on Wednesday, a day after Daniels sued Trump for the right to speak about the intimate relationship she claims they had.
A lawyer for Trump filed the arbitration proceeding against Daniels last week to seek a restraining order to shut her up and protect Mr. Trump, her lawsuit claims.
Daniels, whose legal name is Stephanie Clifford, has said she is taking legal action to be able to speak freely about her relationship with Trump without fear of legal retribution.
Her lawsuit claims Trump and his lawyer Michael Cohen have made a concerted effort to silence her for more than a year.
According to the lawsuit, Trump never signed a non-disclosure agreement arranged between Cohen and Clifford to keep her quiet about their alleged affair.
Trumps failure to sign the hush agreement renders the pact invalid and she is free to talk about their relationship, the lawsuit claimed.
