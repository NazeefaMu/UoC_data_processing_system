All notices should be in all three languages
	
	Laws would be strictly implemented against the public institutions, which do not display public notices in all three languages, the Department of Official Languages today said.
	Commissioner of the Department W. A. Jayawickrama said they had already informed all public institutes of the need to have notices in all three languages.
	They generally have notices in Sinhala and English and in some places just in one language. The law clearly states that public notices should be in all three languages, he said.
	The Department informed the National Transport Board, drivers at three wheeler parks, local government bodies, the Road Development Authority and a number of hospitals to have name boards, signs and notices in all three languages, in accordance with the law.
	He said a unit to provide notices in all three languages to government institutions and private entities would be set up soon.
	Earlier, the Department had provided the stencils and translations of notices in all three languages free of charge for those who needed the service.
	But we will charge the government approved fee for translation at the new unit, he said.
	A fee of Rs. 150 per word would be charged for both public and private institutions, he said.
	Jayawickrama commended private institutions, who were now requesting their services to ensure customers and employees have the option of all three languages.
	Even though some have made the effort to ensure notices appear in all three languages, there were mistakes detected in some. We have requested these notices be removed and re-done, Jayawickrama said. (Darshana Sanjeewa)

CB in talks with IMF for an SBA
	
While admitting that Sri Lankas economy was in a bad shape due to local factors, and global factors beyond its control, Special Assignments Minister Dr. Sarath Amunugama yesterday said the Central Bank was negotiating with the IMF to obtain US$ one billion under a Stand By Arrangement (SBA) to boost sagging foreign reserves of the country.
Addressing the media at the weekly SLFP news briefing at the party head office, Minister Amunugama said the first tranche of the SBA was expected by late February or early March.
Unfortunately, our economy depends on global economic situation. There is a huge gap between the inflow and outflow of capital as a result of the prices of our traditional exports of tea, rubber and coconut have been low in the last couple of years, he said.
In contrast, prices of many of our import goods have been on the rise except oil and petroleum products. Sri Lankas economy would have been in an extremely precarious situation if oil prices also remained high, Minister Amunugama said.
Sri Lankas annual debt service amounts to a mammoth US$ 4 billion or more which is a big burden on the economy. The foreign remittances have remained relatively stagnant in recent times, which has aggravated the situation, Minister Amunugama stressed.
The relief package given to the public in two stages last year, slashing prices of several commodities including fuel and gas prices, large scale vehicle imports using Concessionary Vehicle Import Permits have contributed to deplete the State revenue in a big way, Minister Amunugama said.
Skills Development and Vocational Training Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe said the Middle East crisis, economic meltdown in the US, Europe, and China in particular, had affected the global economy dearly and smaller countries like Sri Lanka in particular.
For instance, Chinas economy has recorded a slow growth of 6.9 % in 2015 as opposed to 12 % or more in the previous ten years or so. The slow growth of the worlds second largest economy has no doubt had a big negative effect on the world economy, he said.
Minister Samarasinghe responding to a journalist said the lifting of sanctions on Iran by the US and the EU undoubtedly was a good message to Sri Lanka but it took time to enjoy the full benefits as clearing of doors for banking transactions and re-arranging and re-opening of imports from countries like Sri Lanka need time.
HE said volatile situation in Russia, Iran, Syria and Iraq - our major tea buyers had reflected very badly on Sri Lankas economy.
Responding to another query, Minister Samarasinghe said he knew nothing about the unnamed investor who had allegedly promised to pump US$ 1 billion into the Sri Lankas economy on a request by Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake.
The official foreign reserves stood at US$ 7.29 billion end December 2015, down from US$ 8.21 billion end 2014.
The IMF approved the first SBA for Sri Lanka equivalent to SDR 1.65 billion or about US$ 2.56 billion in July, 2009. (Sandun A Jayasekera)

Duleep Mendis shocked by bribery claims
	
Former Sri Lankan cricket star and Oman's head coach Duleep Mendis has claimed that he has been 'completely taken by surprise' by the bribery allegations that have rocked his country's cricket scene over the past couple of days.
'I am totally shocked with what I am hearing. I don't yet know whether it's true or not and what the outcome will be like but I must say that I am completely taken by surprise' Mendis told Muscat Daily on Tuesday.
In a sensational development on Monday Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) suspended the national team's fast-bowling coach Anusha Samaranayake for two months and sacked a part-time employee net bowler Gayan Vishwajith for their alleged roles in 'trying to bribe players'.
Sri Lanka's sports minister Dayasiri Jayasekera claimed last month that a man with links with a bookie had offered two members of the Sri Lankan squad around US70000 to lose a Test against West Indies in Galle in October last year.
Mendis who is most famously knon to have captained Sri Lanka to its first Test series win in 1985 has in recent years served as the Sri Lankan team's chief selector. Asked if he ever suspected wrongdoing in the national cricket scene considering the stinging charges that have flown around in recent times Mendis clarified that he's never felt that Sri Lankan players could be involved in any manner whatsoever.
'I don't quite have first-hand information about what's going on In Sri Lanka. I have only learnt about this from the news. But it's really comes as a surprise' Mendis said. (MENAFN - Muscat Daily)

Govt. trying to divert attention: GL
	
	The move to introduce a new Constitution was an attempt to divert the peoples attention away so the Government could establish a special war crime court as proposed by the UNHRC to probe alleged war crime charges and to hunt down armed forces personnel, G.L. Peiris said today.
	Addressing a news conference held at the Dr. N.M. Perera Centre in Borella, Peiris said the government had been given an ultimatum to execute UNHRC proposals and therefore, it would establish the war crimes court and introduce retrospective laws to take action on military personnel.
	The government is planning and it has to execute these actions before the arrival of UN Human Rights High Commissioner Prince Zeid Ra'ad Al Husseins to the country next month.
	Even the British Minister of State at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office Hugo Swire, who concluded a visit in Sri Lanka, said that the government has no more time to act on these proposals, he said.
	Meanwhile, he said the government had taken a U turn in its polices by introducing bills such as the Theravada Bhikkhu Kathikawath Bill and that this Bill was an attempt to silence the Buddhist monks, who are raising voice against the government.
	The government wants to control the Sangha, he said.
	Commenting on the proposed new Constitution, Peiris said the peoples mandate was given to President Maithripala Sirisena only to bring in Constitutional amendments, which would not call for referendum but Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghes call for a new Constitution was against that mandate.
	The President had accepted that he would not go for Constitutional amendments, which will call for a referendum. This principle was disclosed by Minister Susil Premajayantha in Parliament.
	However, the Prime Ministers principle is the opposite of the Presidents. He wants to introduce a new Constitution, that too against the standard procedures. When Parliament focuses on a new Constitution, the Government can execute the setting up of the special war crimes court and retrospective laws. This is a mere attempt to divert the peoples attention from pressing issues, he said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

Govt. seeks consent of Karaka Sabhas
	
	The Cabinet today decided to seek written approval of Karaka Sangha Sabhas, of all the Chapters to the proposed Theravada Bhikku Kathikavath Registration Bill tabled in Parliament recently, it is learnt.
	The bill received criticism from sections of the Maha Sangha, which called it an attempt to impose undue control over Buddhist monks in their activities.
	According to the Government the bill was intended to register a discourse among the main Buddhist Chapters to enforce a code of discipline for monks.
	It, if enacted, will empower the Mahanayakes to do it. However, the Joint Opposition and Bhikkhu Organisations criticised the move, and dubbed it as an attempt by lay people to control the activities of Bhikkhus.
	The Cabinet discussed the matter at its meeting yesterday, and decided to refer the bill for written consent by Karaka Sangha Sabhas of all the Chapters.
	Then only, the government will proceed with it, a government source said.
	Every Bhikkhu has to act in compliance with the provisions of the bill if enacted. Violators of its provisions can be punished. The bill seeks to prohibit Bhikkhus from engaging in occult practices, trade and businesses, obtaining driving licenses and engaging in employment in public or private sector other than educational, social and religious services.
	Bhikkhus, acting in contravention of the bills provisions, are subjected to punishments such as expulsion from their temples, the removal of their posts as Chief Incumbents of respective temples. (Kelum Bandara)

I saw Sumith pushed off the building, says wife
	
Shashika Nishamani Munasinghe, the widow of Sumith Prasanna Munasinghe (29) who died after a controversial fall from a three-storey building in Embilipitiya two weeks ago, during a clash with the police said yesterday that she seen her husband being pushed off the building.
Addressing a media briefing held in Maradana yesterday at which her daughter, mother and some of Sumith Prasannas relatives were also present, she said that they were not at all satisfied with the way the police investigations were conducted.
My husband was never involved in any sort of crime, but he had a habit of speaking out against injustice irrespective of the status of those responsible for the injustice. Today I have lost him because of that.
"Attempts made by us to reveal what we saw that night have failed. The police ignored our revelations. There are many eye witnesses who are keen on giving statements to the police. But no statements from those who witnessed the incident were taken by the police during their so-called investigations, she said.
She described what she witnessed as follows.
At around 11.30 pm I heard a loud noise at the house party where my husband was helping the organisers. I came out of my house and ran towards that house. Several men were being beaten by men wielding batons. A police jeep was stopped in front. I ran here and there looking for my husband, despite my poor health. I found him arguing with some police officers. He was asking them not to break the law and to do their duty properly. I was afraid. I dragged him away and begged him to go home even if some injustice had been done. As we were leaving, the party organisers asked us to have dinner. Suddenly, some police officers came up and pointed my husband out to other police officers who were in plainclothes. They dragged my husband away by his collar. When I was clung to his hands, I was pushed away by the police. He was taken upstairs, then I heard the sound of glass breaking. I rushed upstairs and saw my husband being pushed out of the building. He was begging them not to beat him, but they paid no heed. Finally I found him on the floor in a pool of blood. No one offered to take him to hospital. Later he was taken to hospital in a three-wheeler but I lost him, Sumith's weeping wife said.
She said police had obstructed her when giving her statement at the DIG's office in Ratnapura. She was suspicious of the conduct of the police and the manner in which officers of the Embilipitiya Police and the DIG's office in Ratnapura recorded her complaint.
The impartiality of the ongoing investigations was doubtful, she said.
Meanwhile, Attorney at Law Vijitha G. Punchihewa, who is representing the victims relatives, asked the police to submit the police investigation report issued by DIG C.D. Wickramaratne on the death of Sumith Prasanna.
Social activist Udul Premaratne, who is also a lawyer, said they would take legal action against, "another funny and dramatic turn of events" -- where Police Spokesman ASP Ruwan Gunasekara handled the witnesses on behalf of the police at the magisterial inquiry.
He said this had already destroyed their expectation of an impartial hearing. (Piyumi Fonseka)

Kidney racket: Indian police file cases against six Lankan doctors
	
	The Indian Police filed cases against six Sri Lankan doctors working with four different hospitals in Colombo on the charge of conducting paid kidney transplantation in violation of ethics, the Hindunewspaper reported.
	According to the Police they have allegedly performed the 60 transplantations. Inspectors T. Srinivas, E. Ravindar and P. Praveen are further investigating to nab others involved in the case.

	Investigators realised that Prajapathi and Chouhan were coming to Hyderabad to meet Nookaraju and arrested them.
	Interrogation led to Prajapathi confessing that he was introduced to human organ trade by Dhawal Daruwala, a resident of Surat, in 2012.
	All donors and recipients were from India and transplants took place in four Sri Lankan hospitals.
	He used to charge Rs.28 lakh to Rs.30 lakh for a transplantation of which he kept Rs.5 lakh and paid up the remaining money to the donor, doctors and others. Prajapathi amassed Rs. 3 crore in the trade, bought a house investing Rs. 1.4 crore, an office costing Rs. 30 lakh, and furniture worth Rs.27 lakh.
	Most of his first-time donors turned agents for him and supplied donors. He also paid Rs. 44.5 lakh to his agents. The passport of Nookaraju, three cell phones and computer were seized from them.

New common floor-rates for calls, SMSs from February
	
	Sri Lankas telecom regulator, Telecommunication Regulatory Commission (TRC) has issued instructions to telcos to scrap the existing two rate structure for on-net and off-net voice calls and replace it with a new common floor rate with effect from February 01, 2016.
	While the new floor rates have been set below the existing floor rates for voice calls taken outside the network, the voice rates within the network and the SMS rates have been raised. (See table for the new and existing rates) The TRC said the floor rate revision was made in response to submissions made by the telcos and would only be applicable for new connections issued from the effective date.
	New floor rates could be a move by the telcos to minimize the impact of declining margins amid the substitution of traditional voice/text services by low margin data services.
	It may have also been prompted by the thumping one-off taxes slapped on telcos by the Interim Budget in January 2015.
	However, the new floor rates are unlikely to have a significant impact on their margins as the voice market is long saturated in Sri Lanka. Meanwhile, the letter sent to the chief executives of telcos by the newly appointed TRC Director General, Sunil S. Sirisena on January 5, 2016 read, the Commission has decided to appoint a committee to study the Commission approved tariff plans which were below the determined common floor rates and make recommendations as to whether such tariff plans should be revised in line with the common floor rates or allow to continue as it is.
	The TRC in 2010 brought in floor rates for the first time to safeguard the industry when its viability was threatened by the intense price war among service providers, which led to price undercutting to grab market share from each other in a largely saturated mobile telephony market.
	However, this measure only temporarily improved telco fortunes as the rapid take off of cheap data services subsequently began to eat into their margins.
	Sri Lankas telco market is one of the most  overcrowded markets in the world with five operators serving a 21 million population. Fitch Ratings this week revised the outlook on the Lankan telcos to Stable from Negative due to scrapping of recurring taxes imposed on them from the Interim Budget in 2015, which could have diluted the industry Earnings Before Interest Tax Depreciation and Amortization margin by 6  7 percent.
	Fitch Ratings in March 2015 revised down the outlook to Negative from Stable due to a host of hostile, one-off and retrospective taxes imposed on the telcos.
	However, Fitch Ratings in November 2014 said the outlook on the Lankan telcos could be revised to Positive (from Stable), either if industry consolidation results in improvement in profitability or the regulators introduction of a data tariff floor, easing the pressure on profitability.

Sri Lankans not welcome at Mirissa Bay Hotels
	
Several restaurants located in the Mirissa Bay have refused to serve food, beverages and provide accommodation to Sri Lankans because of their anti-social behavior, several customers complained.
Based on complaints of discrimination by Sri Lankans who had visited these hotels, Daily Mirror contacted some of the hotel owners in Mirissa and they too confirmed that they were reluctant to serve Sri Lankans because of their unruly behaviour.
I and two of my friends were turned away from several restaurants on the Mirissa Bay after being told by restaurant staff that they did not serve locals. When we made some inquiries, the reasons given were that some Sri Lankan men behaved in an unruly manner and harassed foreign women. Unruly men are common in any country, the solution is to have bouncers to control the offenders, a guest we contacted said.
Another Sri Lankan said when he ordered a coffee from a particular restaurant in the Mirissa Bay, the waiters had said they only served foreigners and could not serve the locals.
However, when contacted by Daily Mirror, one of the restaurant owners wishing to remain unnamed said they had stopped serving food and beverages and providing accommodation to Sri Lankans because of several complaints and mentioned some of the embarrassing incidents which had happened to tourists, tarnishing the image of Sri Lankan hospitality.
Anti-social behaviour causing a nuisance to other guests, harassment, intimidation, threats or actual violence by local guests under the influence of liquor has been reported from many restaurants in the neighborhood including ours. We cant let down our regular guests because of the locals who create problems for all concerned, the owner said.
The guests urged the Tourism Ministry to intervene in such cases ensure that the locals are not deprived of being served at these hotels.
Meanwhile, several attempts made by Daily Mirror to contact the Director General of the Tourism Development Authority to inquire about the complaints had failed. (Piyumi Fonseka)

TN governor demands justice for war victims in SL
	
The Indian government should prevail upon the Sri Lankan government to take action against those who had committed crimes against Tamils in the last phase of the war, Tamil Nadu Governor K. Rosaiah has demanded in the state Assembly on Wednesday.
The Hindu reported that the entire opposition parties had staged a walkout alleging the ruling AIADMK government had failed in all fronts and its failure to release water from Chembarambakkam Lake caused the flood in Chennai.
DMK floor leader M.K. Stalin told reporters in Chennai that even though his party had demanded a judicial inquiry into the issue, the state government had not given any proper response so far. The Governors address also made no reference to the issue.
Recalling the resolution adopted in the state Assembly asking the Indian government to take steps to adopt a resolution in the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) for an international inquiry into the war crimes and violations of the Geneva convention by the Sri Lankan government, he expressed the hope that the Indian government should persuade Sri Lanka to restore the Tamil families their lands.
It should ensure equal rights and an opportunity to live peacefully with dignity, he said.
The Governor had also condemned the regular attacks on Tamil fishermen and seizure of their boats and nets by the Sri Lankan Navy, saying the reluctance on the part of the Sri Lankan government in releasing fishing boats even after the release of fishermen had caused agony among the fisher folk in Tamil Nadu.
It is our duty to find a lasting and permanent solution to this issue by retrieving Katchatheevu and restoring traditional rights of our fishermen, he said.

The government has decided to go ahead with several Chinese funded infrastructural projects, including the Port City Project, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe told foreign journalists in Davos today.
We are going ahead with Chinese funded projects, including the Port City and the next phase of the Hambantota Port. China is an economic power in Asia and is ready to work on some development projects in Sri Lanka, he said.
He said Sri Lanka would like China to invest in other sectors, including real estate, and also play a role in developing Sri Lanka as a logistics hub.
He said discussions were being held with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) regarding contingency plans to face any adverse international situation. No one knows what the international situation would be in 2016; and it is clear that Sri Lanka should gear up to face any situation. We are looking into the kind of arrangements we can make with the IMF, he said; adding that he would meet the Managing Director of the IMF while in Davos.
Responding to a question by the foreign journalists on the reconciliation process, he said the Ministry of Foreign Affairs was working out a plan concerning accountability. He said some lands occupied by the military had been handed back to the owners and more land would be handed back in the future. He said there were no political prisoners in Sri Lanka and those in prison had been tried and convicted.
