Army major, 3 soldiers killed in Kashmir
	

Hindustan Times (Srinagar), Aug 07 2018 - An Army major and three soldiers were killed while foiling an infiltration bid in north Kashmirs Gurez sector, officials said on Tuesday. At least two militants were killed in the operation, they added. 
The encounter between the patrolling party of the Rashtriya Rifles and the infiltrating group took place at Govind Nallah in Gurez sector of Bandipore district. Initial reports said a group of eight was trying to infiltrate into the country. Of them, four ran back to Pakistan-occupied-Kashmir, officials said. 
Details of the operation are awaited. 
Last week, five militants were killed in a counter-insurgency operation in Kilora village of South Kashmirs Shopian district. A civilian died and two others were injured in Gunawpora in the same district when forces opened fire on protesters at the funeral of one of the slain militants.

Countrywide bus strike from Sunday night: ACPBA
	
A countrywide bus strike will be launched from Sunday midnight as a protest against the tender procedure for route permits, the All Ceylon Private Bus Association (ACPBA) said yesterday.
ACPBA Secretary Anjana Priyanjith said the National Transport Commission (NTC) and the Western Province-Road Passenger Transport Authority (RPTA) were trying to carry out a tender for route permits whereas currently only selected route permits were issued on tenders.
By the use of tenders, the NTC has earned Rs.400 million for the Matara-Colombo Expressway and the RPTA had earned Rs.450 million, he said.
Mr Priyanjith said the NTC wants to issue route permits by way of tenders, which had already been issued more than 15 years ago.
It is not fair, he said. We will request details about the revenue earned by the NTC and RPTA during previous route permit tenders through the Right to Information (RTI) Act. We are launching the countrywide strike to urge the NTC to withdraw the decision to carry out tenders for all routes. The bus strike will continue if the fuel price is also increased again by the monthly price revision which is scheduled Friday." (Chaturanga Samarawickrama)

Desperate Govt. tapping phones: JO
	
In a last minute attempt of survival, the Government had started listening in to phone conversations of, not only its political opponents but also Ministers, who were criticising the Government, the Joint Opposition (JO) charged today.
JO National Organiser Dullas Alahapperuma said a special Police Unit headed by a DIG had been established by the Government to tap into peoples phone conversations and latest hi-tech equipment had been brought down from Japan for the purpose.
The Unit is based in Nugegoda and it has been directed to tap into phone conversations of JO MPs, Heads of Media institutions and even some Police personnel, he said.
Minister Rauff Hakeem, who expressed opposing views over the electoral system, had also been listed as someone whose phone conversations should be tapped into, the MP told a news conference.
He said these were signs of the Government heading towards a Gestapo-like administration, which prevailed in Nazi Germany.
The MP warned that the JO would keep a tab on Government officials, who would commit wrongdoings under the directives of political authority.
Meanwhile, he said Parliament and Speaker could learn lessons from the Indian Lok Sabha, where there was no Opposition Leader because no opposition political party had collected more than 10 per cent of seats in Parliament.
In our Parliament, the Opposition Leader post has been given to the Tamil National Alliance (TNA), a party which has only seven per cent of seats in Parliament.
The JO has more than 30 per cent of seats, but still the Speaker hasn't given us the post of Opposition Leader, he said.(Lahiru Pothmulla)

ETERNAL CONTRADICTIONS
	

Politics of nepotism
In any country, there are party politics but in our country, we also have family politics and countless ministers and ministries, there are Pradeshiya Sabhas, Palath Sabhas and the good lord knows what else, but all these Sabhas are inundated with ministers and ministries!!! What they are actually doing to warrant the prestige of minister, no one knows!!! 
Into this political arena comes the families, the secretarial wives and daughters, the brothers and sisters, who are supposedly the office managers and in some cases, even the peons!!! Not forgetting the uncles and aunts!!! They are prepared to take whatever position is given regardless of what the job title is; the pay packet at the end of the month is all that matters!!! WHO PAYS ALL THESE SALARIES YOU AND I, SO ARE WE NOT ENTITLED TO ASK WHAT THEY DO MORE THAN THAT, WHAT DOES THIS CONGLOMERATION OF SABHAS DO AS IT IS, WE HAVE COUNTLESS MINISTRIES, PERHAPS THE BIGGEST PARLIAMENT IN THE WORLD!!! SO WHEN ALL THESE MINISTRIES ARE DUPLICATED OR TRIPLICATED, WHAT HAPPENS MORE IMPORTANTLY, WHY ARE THEY NECESSARY


Local architects overlooked

We read in newspapers that Haycarb bagged the US$56 million Mega Sewerage Project in the Maldives; while congratulations are due to Haycarb on this achievement, we are constrained to ask why our local architectural and building companies are overlooked when it comes to building high-rises in our country Sewerage is entirely different to construction but why is it that when construction is necessary, our people always look to the Japanese and the Chinese to do the work Are they saying outright that local contractors are not good enough for them and that the Japanese and the Chinese are superior ISNT IT TIME WE STARTED APPRECIATING OUR OWN PEOPLE DELEGATING JOBS LOCALLY


Illegal acts with legal cover

JALIYAS ARREST WARRANT EXTENDED, WHY DIDNT WE ALLOW MR TO BRING HIM BACK ANYWAY WHAT HAPPENED TO THE OTHERS, MAHENDRAN AND THE OTHER BUNCH OF CRIMINALS WHO HAVE BEEN ALLOWED TO SLIP AWAY NOW DHAMMALOKA THERA HAS BEEN ALLOWED TO PROCEED TO LONDON, SO MANY OTHERS WERE ALLOWED BEFORE HIM BUT WHO KEEPS A COUNT OF THESE PEOPLE AND CHECKS IF THEY HAVE RETURNED ON TIME They are allowed to proceed and then they disappear, that is the bottom line here!!! So many were allowed before but no one knows if they have returned or not!!! WHO CARES ANYWAY Our President said categorically that DRUG TRAFFICKERS WOULD GET THE DEATH SENTENCE, AND NOW WE SEE ONE OF THE BIGGEST TRAFFICKING IN HEROIN GETTING LIFE IMPRISONMENT Do these people even know the difference between WHAT THEY SAY AND WHAT THEY DO Three hearty cheers to the old lady L.B. Karunawathi who has volunteered to take up the position of executioner!!! She very correctly asks WHERE ARE THE PEOPLE WHO GANG RAPED VIDIYA What happened to the other victim SEYA SADEWMI Very pertinent questions indeed, which this column has asked many times but got no answers!!! People are allowed to commit all kinds of heinous atrocities and are then protected under the cover of Buddhism (with no offence meant to Buddhism) REINSTATING CAPITAL PUNISHMENT IS THE ONLY CURE FOR THIS COUNTRY!!! WHEN DEFENCE COUNSEL HAVE ASKED FOR FAVOURS, WHERE IS JUSTICE IN THIS COUNTRY


Ailing patients vs. protesting doctors

Looking back, human life seems to be the cheapest commodity still!!! People dont think twice, or one could say, dont think at all before they take a life!!! The number of murders one reads about is horrendous and even more horrifying is the cold-blooded manner in which they are carried out!!! When we look at human life, we are instantly reminded of another injustice against human life and that is the action of our doctors who are supposed to be the guardians, the protectors of human life!!! We see the SLMC Chairman resigning while the GMOA goes ahead with its strike!!! On the one hand, it is heartening to note that the GMOA has resorted to this issue and I quote from the SLMC Chairman: The SLMC is a statutory body established for the purpose of protecting healthcare seekers by ensuring the maintenance of academic and professional standards by health professionals. However, there are critical issues in the archaic Medical Ordinance. I cannot continue my duties without correcting them. While we applaud the SLMC and the GMOA for the stand they have taken for the benefit of patients (as they proclaim); we are constrained to ask, WHO DO THE PATIENTS GO TO IN THE EVENT OF A STRIKE AND THIS HAS NOT BEEN THEIR FIRST


Vanguards of health

These vanguards of our health, who claim they are striking because of us, need to take a closer look at themselves!!! We, the general public, pay colossal amounts as consultation fees just to see them, having done so and even being given a number, we patiently wait and I mean PATIENTLY WAIT for our number to be called, but that depends entirely on whether the PROFESSOR, DOCTOR OR SURGEON in question has deigned to make his or her appearance!!! You are asked to come at 5.00 p.m., but if you are lucky, he or she might show up at 7.00 p.m.!!! Most often to the horror of all concerned, an announcement is made over the public address system saying THE PROFESSOR, DOCTOR OR SURGEON YOU ARE WAITING FOR IS NOT COMING THAT DAY!!! SO, WHAT ELSE CAN YOU DO EXCEPT TO GET ANOTHER APPOINTMENT TO SEE HIM OR HER BE THAT AS IT MAY, WHEN YOU ARE ASKED TO BRING THE TEST REPORTS TO SEE THE DOCTOR YOU HAVE ALREADY SEEN, YOU ARE TOLD THAT HE OR SHE HAS 40 OR MORE PATIENTS AND IF YOU COULD MAKE ANOTHER APPOINTMENT!!! THIS MEANS YOU PAY ANOTHER CONSULTATION FEE TO SHOW YOUR TEST REPORTS!!! VERY COSY, COMFORTABLE AND ADVANTAGEOUS, DONT YOU THINK


Pay hike

Now they want their salaries increased. Apparently, what they are getting isnt enough it seems!!! Poor guys, they have to walk to Parliament, their lifestyle is in jeopardy, their children are impoverished and it is just not possible to keep up the posh lifestyle they are used to!!! So, what do we BEGGARS DO WE JUST HAVE TO GIVE THEM THE INCREMENTS THEY ARE DEMANDING IN THE SERVICE OF THEIR COUNTRY, ISNT IT AFTER ALL, THEY CAN ONLY ASK, THEY CANNOT GO ON STRIKE LIKE ALL OTHER ILLUSTRIOUS PEOPLE, NOT EVEN FOR 24 HOURS!!!

Fuel price hike likely if US imposes sanctions on Iran:  PM
	
The impending US economic sanctions on Iran might result in another fuel price hike as it would have a negative effect on Sri Lanka, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe told Parliament today.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said this when a question was raised by Joint Opposition MP Bandula Gunawardane on certain scandals involving vehicle and gold imports in the House last afternoon.
The impending US sanctions on Iran could affect Sri Lanka adversely. We dont know whether this would result in an oil price hike as Sri Lanka currently imports Iranian crude. However, we will have to be prepared to face any adverse situation, the Prime Minister said.
He said that the ongoing trade war between China and the USA would also affect Sri Lanka.
The Prime Minister said Sri Lanka should be prepared to face any adverse situation that may be caused by these global developments. (Yohan Perera and Ajith Siriwardana)

The scheduled fuel price revision every two months would come to effect on Friday (10) where there might be a drop in fuel prices, the Finance Ministry said.
Fuel prices are determined every two months according to the pricing formula introduced on July 10 but it had not affected kerosene prices.
Ministrys Information Director M. Ali Hassan said when compared with the July international crude oil prices, they had dropped this month.
He said according to World Market prices a barrel of crude oil was selling at SGD73.85 in July and SGD98.09 in May while it had dropped to SGD69.05 this month.
Therefore, there may be a drop in the prices in the wake of Fridays fuel pricing committee meeting, Mr Hassan said. (Chaturanga Samarawickrama)

Hard taskmaster to get his 68th driver!
	

There is a top team member in yahapalanaya who has got the knack for stealing the limelight by someway or other. In fact, he had his hour of glory when he made a bid for the countrys highest position once.

This bigwig, they say, expects consummate fastidiousness from all who work under him and would not tolerate even a minor failing or a shortcoming on their part. If he takes a dislike to someone, he would immediately get rid of him declaring his place out of bounds for him. This keeps his aides always fully awake and alert.
Of all members of his private staff, the ones who mostly fall from his grace are his drivers. Even a very minor failing on the part of a driver would cost him his job. He had occasion to sack 67 drivers for the last three years. Now that the 67th driver too has been sent home, a replacement would be a big problem, his aides say.
Most drivers had been dismissed for offences like sudden jamming of brakes and causing the vehicle to shudder, shake up or hop forward.

Hassan Esufally aims to be first Sri Lankan to complete worlds most arduous marathon in Peru
	
Hassan Esufallys current fitness shape
Hassan Esufally is taking on the challenging Inca Trail Marathon as his sixth marathon in his quest to complete a marathon in each continent of the world, thereby becoming the first Sri Lankan to complete a marathon in each continent of the world. Achieving this feat will propel him into a unique and exclusive club of the worlds greatest marathon runners  the 7 Continents Marathon Club.
The Inca Trail Marathon is one of the most arduous and difficult full marathons in the world, due to its high and constantly changing altitudes, steep uphill and downhill terrain, changing weather conditions and the difficultly of running on an uneven surface in rocky conditions.
Esufally will be running this marathon on August 9, 2018 and, if successful, will become the first Sri Lankan to have completed this Marathon.
I want to conquer the worlds hardest marathon as part of overall my seven continents marathon goal, Esufally says.
The Inca Trail Marathon running adventure begins in Cusco, Peru - the archaeological capital of the Americas, at an altitude of 11,150 feet. The marathon route follows the ancient pilgrimage route to the legendary lost city of Machu Picchu, and altitudes on the route will vary from 8,000ft above sea level to nearly 14,000ft above sea level.
This route is considered one of the most authentic ways to see the Inca trail and to experience the many different elements of the Machu Picchu complex. But the grueling course also includes a steep stretch of stone steps, known as the Dead Womans Pass at an extreme altitude of nearly 14,000ft. The Inca trail is dotted with several such sections of stone steps, as well as narrow paths overlooking steep cliffs. While a clear trail is available to runners, it is often over varying elevations and with sections strewn with natural rocks and boulders.
The Elevation Profile & Course map
Hikers, who also use this trail, usually take 4 days to reach Machu Picchu from Cusco. But the Inca Trail Marathon runners have to complete the marathon distance (42.2 km) in a time limit of 24 hours to be recognized as an official finisher of this amazing marathon.
In order to succeed at this arduous event, I have got into the best shape of my life, Esufally says.
Living in low-altitude, coastal conditions as experienced in Colombo, Esufally has the added challenge of adapting his body to these extreme altitude conditions.
I have tracked my nutrition diligently and included high intense interval training workouts with an oxygen depletion mask on, done hill running and lots of weight circuit training in the gym, he says
The Inca Trail Marathon is the penultimate marathon in his quest to conquer all seven continents of the world.
My aim is to bring pride to Sri Lanka, and to popularize adventure marathons, and hopefully to inspire others to also attempt these formidable goals, Esufally says. We may be a small island nation, but we have immense potential for sports and adventure and we need to keep pushing ourselves to achieve bigger and greater sporting goals.
A full marathon is usually 42.2 km (26 miles and 385 yards being the historical measure) but each continent presents its own unique challenges and extreme conditions.
Esufally has already completed marathons in the continents of Europe (Stockholm Marathon in June 2017), Asia (Colombo Marathon in October 2017), Australia (Melbourne Marathon in 2014 and 2016) and this year he has completed the Boston Marathon in USA (April) and the Big Five Marathon in South Africa (June).
Hassan Esufallys quest will be complete when, in December this year, he competes in the 14th Antarctic Ice Marathon in Antarctica, which takes place at 80 Degrees South, just a few hundred miles from the South Pole at the foot of the Ellsworth Mountains.
This is truly a race for adventure marathoners as it presents formidable weather and running conditions: the underfoot conditions are snow and ice throughout, with an average wind chill temperature of -20C at an altitude of 700 meters. Runners also face the possibility of having to endure katabatic winds, strong winds that come down through the polar plateau and can gather speeds of up to 300 kilometers per hour.
The 7 Continents Marathon Club is an exclusive club of elite marathon runners who have completed some of the most grueling marathons in the world. At present there are less than 300 members worldwide. The Club is exclusive and reserved for athletes who are carefully vetted to prove they have run a marathon within the Antarctic Circle on the Antarctica continent, as well as on the other six continents.

Highly perturbed over this decision, hundreds of his fans had appealed to him to rethink his decision without success, they say.
Meanwhile, some people who had made discreet inquiries as to why the poll chief had decided to say good bye to the Facebook, claim that they have stumbled on the reason.
Their finding is that it had come to light recently that the poll chief and a certain professor who worked tirelessly to bring yahapalanaya into power were the anonymous co-authors of a highly controversial FB page and he decided to leave the Facebook when some people had started criticizing him following this revelation, they say.

The madam has incurred the wrath of the big swarthy one for distributing development allocations among her favorite members without consulting him or other partys Diyawanna members representing the city constituencies.
He had charged that the madam had reduced him and the other Diyawanna members from the city to nonentities by bypassing them in the matter of distributing development allocations.
He had also complained that the madam had consistently disregarded requests made to her to convene a meeting of stakeholders to iron out the issue.
All indications are that this row will take a turn for the worse soon. However, the party leader has so far turned a blind eye to this situation, they say.

How Judiciary can improve SL economy
	

Investors should be given the ability to quickly and reliably secure their rights under the law in Sri Lanka
	
	Despite some laws in those Acts meeting the twenty first century requirements, these Acts are out of date and they caused delays in court proceedings
	
	If property rights are protected, people undertake to do socially productive productions such as innovations
Sri Lanka had an opportunity to become the best place for an International Arbitration Centre in the region, where commercial disputes between Companies or individuals in different States are resolved effectively by providing a reliable legal platform as an alternative disputes resolution.
We could have easily capitalised our geographical location to setup an Independent Arbitration Centre meeting international standards. It could have attracted local and foreign investors, traders and businessmen to utilise the Arbitration Centre and visit Sri Lanka when they have commercial disputes that need to be resolved.
While we failed, Singapore and Malaysia grabbed this opportunity with both hands and setup Arbitration Centres known as Singapore International Arbitration Centre (SIAC) and Asian International Arbitration Centre (AIAC) with great effectiveness. For the moment, Singapore is growing rapidly to become the leader in Arbitration.
Sri Lanka on the other hand, is still struggling even to make important amendments to several outdated sections of the Arbitration Act (1996), which regulates local commercial disputes.

Establishing an effective and reliable system of commercial litigation is an important factor in enabling the Sri Lankan economy achieve higher income category

It was a wasted opportunity that could have been used to boost up our economy in various dimensions in a novel way. Innovation is the engine of future economy, although it is unlikely to be welcomed at the execution level of policy planning of this island.
According to the Central Bank of Sri Lanka, we had a debt burden of Rs. 10.269 trillion by the end of 2017. Even though the question of how we face this challenge is somewhat confusing and complex; policy makers have no choice other than to discover proper plans for future economic situations in order to enable the Sri Lankan economy achieve at least some comfort.
Socialists might have a different view on the matter. They may contemplate a whole systematic transformation of the economy, which is perceivable, but it might not be pragmatic from the context of a contemporary world.
The necessity for setting up a platform, allowing the think-tanks of this island or elsewhere to discover solutions to this conundrum is therefore critically important. Such an interesting idea was shared during the recently concluded Lawbiz Symposium organised by the Colombo Law Society. Supreme Court Justice and Presidents Counsel Prasanna Jayawardena, who delivered the keynote address at the Lawbiz Symposium, is regarded as an expert in the field of commercial litigation before he was appointed to the Supreme Court of Sri Lanka as a judge.
Many might think that the application of the laws in a society would directly impact its economy. Great care must be taken in grasping such a statement.Following is the crux of Jayawardenas speech.

Attracting investors through an effective and reliable system of commercial litigation
	
	Sri Lanka is still struggling to make important amendments to several outdated sections of the Arbitration Act

He considers Sri Lanka as an emerging market economy. At the onset, Justice Jayawardena elaborated on what an emerging market economy is and how Sri Lanka could be regarded as an emerging economy despite the size of its economy, in which the Gross Domestic Production (GDP) is only around US $ 87.2 billion.
The term emerging economy is actually used to describe countries, which have effective banking systems, liquid equity markets, regulatory mechanisms, unified and coverable currency and other components of a developed economy, but have not yet achieved the debt of security, reliability, stability efficiency and strength.
We have a very reliable banking system with advanced telecommunication and technology facilities, intelligence, literate and tech savvy work force, small, but effective liquid equity market, improving regulatory mechanism and also Sri Lankas immense potential to be a regional hub thanks to our unique geographical location, as firstly the centre of the Indian ocean, secondly as a ceiling to the east west trade and thirdly as the gateway to South-Asia, he said.
Justice Jayawardenas observation is that with these factors we should still be regarded as an emerging economy despite the nation being small in size.

Economy and the system of commercial litigation
Establishing an effective and reliable system of commercial litigation is an important factor in enabling the Sri Lankan economy achieve higher income category said Justice Jayawardena. The questions arise as to what exactly commercial litigation means, why it is so much important and whether the current system is adequate
Justice Jayawardena elaborated that a system of Commercial Litigation is meant as litigation arising out of disputes between parties in contractual terms, disputes over rights in companies, disputes over intellectual property rights, disputes over banking transactions, and various sort of disputes arise in the field of commerce and business. He said especially the court process and applications of laws in resolving those disputes are regarded as litigation.

What rights are at stake when there is commercial litigation
Identifying those rights is necessary for us to accurately assess the importance of establishing an effective and reliable system of commercial litigation cautiously said he. The rights at stake in most commercial litigation are private property rights.
		
			Law as an awL : 
			To pierce the just-ice
			
		As it was needless to say that private property rights are critically important to investors and entrepreneurs who are contemplating investing in Sri Lanka, Justice Jayawardena was of the view that such investors and entrepreneurs will do investing only if they have the confidence that their private property rights, investments and trading means will be safe and secure in Sri Lanka.
He underscored that investors should be given the ability to quickly and reliably secure their rights under the law in Sri Lanka in the event their property rights and investments in Sri Lanka are disputed or threatened or taken away.
Therefore, Justice Jayawardena stated that these laws and courts (commercial litigation) are crucially important to investors and traders who wish to invest in Sri Lanka. As of today, establishing effective commercial litigation is a vital factor in Sri Lankan economy for new investors, entrepreneurs and traders because attracting more foreign direct investments to Sri Lanka and encouraging foreigners to invest in here are essential for Sri Lanka in order to enable the path towards growing to become a high income country
According to CBSL, total Government debt in 2017 is about Rs. 10.313 trillion which is an increase of Rs. 9.9 trillion from 2016.
Justice Jayawardena said that the total Government debt at end of 2017 -- 77.6% of the GDP, is an improvement from ratio of 78.8% from the end of 2016.
As we can see these worrying statics show the need to attract more investments to the economy and therefore the need to attract more foreign investments. It is critically important to have effective and reliable commercial litigation system for Sri Lanka to attract more investments and trade.


So improvement of the efficacy of commercial litigation in a country promotes and encourages investments and trade and protects them from expropriation risks


Protecting property rights of investors through effective litigation
There were many great scholars including Montesquieu and Adam Smith who went onto establish the importance of having a strong system of law for property rights for many reasons. According to Justice Jayawardenas point of view those reasons can be as follows.

Lack of effective commercial litigation regarding the economy may result in reluctance of investors to come here as there is no protection for property rights.
	
	A corrupt legal system will not quickly enable contracts in the event of a default, so the borrowers will be reluctant to offer their assets as collateral in an unsafe legal system where lenders could take those assets even where there is no default and will discourage trading in the economy because there is a difficulty to recover.
	
	If property rights are protected, people undertake to do socially productive productions such as scientific innovations which keep the existence of human being on this planet.
	
	Institutions and regulators are necessary to promote capital market and the growth of the economy.
	
	High cost to defending contractual and property rights in an ineffective system of commercial litigation will have high expenses for legal advice and court processes and a large amount of productive time is spent over litigation.
	
	Expropriation in a volatile system of commercial litigation will cause investors being reluctant to invest in a country where laws, subject to the litigation, are seen as those subject to the change due to political factors.

So improvement of the efficacy of commercial litigation in a country promotes and encourages investments and trade and protects them from expropriation risks Justice Jayawardena explained.
It was said that, countries with less investor protection, measured by the character of their laws and courts and procedures, are smaller and narrower markets, which have less access to external finance.
According to Justice Jayawardena, countries with well protected property rights, promote firms reinvest their profits and promote better allocation of their resources, which enables to move faster, hence advancing the overall economic growth.
He further explained that using the reforms made to the Pakistan legal system in 2002 at a cost of US $ 350 million, which was then equivalent to 0.1% GDP of Pakistan economy had a dramatic effect on increasing confidence in courts including judicial efficiency.
These reforms soon transferred interestingly to tangible positive economic results in Pakistan increasing GDP by 0.5%, which is five times higher than the budgeted amount.

According to Justice Jayawardena, countries with well protected property rights, promote firms and to reinvest their profits


Application of commercial litigation
System of commercial litigation in Sri Lanka comprises laws, regulations and courts system. Our legal system has the common law, Roman Dutch law, English law, and statutes of various laws passed by the parliament.
Justice Jayawardena simplified further that Roman Dutch law applies to mortgages, guarantees, suretiships, etc., while English law applies mostly to the other areas of commercial laws such as shipping trade company laws, partnerships, banking, principles of merchants, lands, and life insurances and so on.
In addition to that, there are specific statutes which cover specific areas of the commercial law such as Companies Act, Intellectual Property Act, Sale of Goods Ordinance, Insolvency Act, and Arbitration Act and so on.
Justice Jayawardena stated that several enactments in this field of law are much older as Sales of Goods Ordinance enacted in 1896, Bill of Exchange Act enacted in 1937 and the Mortgage Act enacted in 1949.
He also said that the procedural process of court of law which set out in the Code of Civil Procedure (1889), and the Evidence Ordinance (1895), which governs the production of evidence in court, had been amended often considering the modern requirements.
Despite some laws in those Acts meeting the twenty first century requirements, these Acts are out of date and they caused delays in court proceedings. Such one example is Insolvency Ordinance 1853 which has very little effect in todays economic environment, said the Justice.

As of today, establishing effective commercial litigation is a vital factor in Sri Lankan economy for new investors, entrepreneurs and traders because attracting more foreign direct investments to Sri Lanka and encouraging foreigners to invest in here are essential for Sri Lanka

Outdated Court system handling commercial litigation
In 1990s, the Commercial High Courts were established in Colombo to entertain and decide cases with regard to commercial disputes. Now there are three commercial high courts in Colombo, which hear cases where the dispute is over five million and arises within Western Province. All other disputes below five million are heard in District Courts. And disputes outside the Western Province over five million are decided in District Courts.
Justice Jayawardena observed that even though, these three Commercial High Courts function efficiently ,where the average time for a case to be resolved is around two years or less, what is more important is whether the potential investors who wish to invest in Sri Lanka see our legal system as effective
He further explained about a report which is taken as measurement of attractiveness regarding a country where investment and trading are considered. That is the Ease of Doing Business Report, which is published annually by the World Bank.
The 2018 report ranks Sri Lanka in 111th position among 190 countries, while Vietnam is at the 68th, India is at the 100, Thailand at the 26th, Malaysia at the 24th and Singapore at the 2nd. Below us are The Philippines is at the 113th with Pakistan at 147th and Bangladesh at 177th.
This report also includes a measurement as to how the Enforcing of Contractual rights lasts effectively in a system of commercial litigation in a country. Interestingly, Sri Lanka ranks 165th in the enforcing contracts classification among 190 countries.
The report further states, that court proceedings in Sri Lanka take a very long time, about 1300 days (3 1/2 years) to standardise disputes to be resolved.
Whether one likes it or not, the global perception on the commercial litigation in Sri Lanka, is not sufficient, said Justice Jayawardena.

      What needs to be done    
Even though, it requires great attention and care as to what needs to be done, Justice Jayawardena suggested some pragmatic approaches that could be adopted for a better change.

Speed up the time taken to initiate an action, and then to have it determined by a court. This will require a careful study of the problems that we may face. And that study has to be accompanied by a study of comparable jurisdictions, which have achieved a reduction in court time. This is one of the higher priorities that our legal system has to consider.
	
	Need, start taking steps regarding digitalization and automation of court procedure. It allows cases to be filed electronically through a secured platform, resulting case management system to be established to keep tracking of progresses of cases.
	
	Several procedural laws have to be amended to prevent unnecessary delays in pre-trial stages.
	
	He also said that a Court should consider more on the substance of a matter rather than on the formalities.
	
	Bringing more clarity on jurisdictional provisions of the law by taking necessary steps to amend of unnecessary technical rules.
	
	For the importance of increasing resources for judicial training, judges should be given the knowledge on commercial matters to quickly resolve disputes and they should be trained to use technology in proceedings to speed up the proceedings.
	
	Ensuring the importance of being corrupt-free by taking actions immediately and imposing punishments against the corrupted Government servants.
	
	Finally to improve mediation and alternative disputes resolution methods.
In conclusion, Justice Prasanna Jayawardena invited the Law Commission of Sri Lanka and Legal Draftsman Department and other relevant authorities, which are examining these issues, to give a great care and initiate necessary actions without further delay.

## Title: JO should announce its presidential candidate now - Ven. Bengamuwe Nalaka Thera
## Section: Hard talk
## Date: 8 August 2018 12:00 am
JO should announce its presidential candidate now - Ven. Bengamuwe Nalaka Thera
	
Govt should have invited Lord Nasbey soon after he spoke in support of SL
	
	Greatest meritorious act is to topple Govt now
	
	We need to build a local support base for him
	
	It is possible if proper strategies are applied

Ven. Bengamuwe Nalaka Thera, a leading Buddhist monk associated with the nationalist movement, shares his views on the current political developments in the country in an interview with Daily Mirror

Q You are a leading member of the Buddhist clergy who voiced against the government right from its formation. How do you see the current status of politics
We are not content with the political situation. I am not referring to the governments politics only. We cannot be happy about politics being done by the opposition either.

QWhy do you say so
There is an urgent thing to be done. It is the agitation for elections. The main struggle should be aimed at toppling this government somehow. I do not see any concerted effort being made in that direction. In my view, the most meritorious act to be done is to unseat this government. Buddhists are the majority in this country. Yet, all believe in meritorious acts.

This Government will do anything to stay in power. Other political forces in the country insist elections as means to get into power again. Both the government and the opposition are driven by the craze for power

QYet, it is only possible by securing a majority in Parliament. How could it be done
It has to be planned strategically. We do not divulge strategies in advance.

QDo you believe it is possible
If the proper strategies are applied, it is possible.

QWhy do you consider toppling the government as the topmost priority of the opposition at this juncture
Three years have elapsed after the government was formed in 2015. There is no development in the country taking place. It is difficult for people to eke out their living under the current circumstances. We, as members of the Buddhist clergy, live off meals or alms offered by people. So, we can sense their economic difficulties. The government is held responsible for this economic plight of the people.
There are signs of terrorism raising its ugly head again in the north. Politicians like Vijayakala Maheswaran, C.V. Wigneswaran, M.A. Sumanthiran and R. Sampanthan boost Tamil separatism by making various statements. Their separatist agenda is becoming obvious by the day. This government is held responsible again for it.

QHow do you support your argument that terrorism is rising today
When the intelligence apparatus is crippled, underground preparations for terrorist activities cannot be traced in advance. Recently, a cache of weapons was seized, while being transported in a three-wheeler in the north. If the intelligence services were operational in full, it could have been detected at the initial stage of its planning. We need not wait till it is transported in a vehicle. That is the advantage of having an intelligence service. Intelligence officers who worked diligently in the past have been penalized now on various charges by the government.

QAs a Buddhist monk, you travelled internationally and lobbied against the UNHRC resolution on Sri Lanka. How do you assess the results you got in this case
Sri Lanka is always under surveillance by so-called human rights activists because there is a subservient government. In 2009, a section of the international community wanted former President Mahinda Rajapaksa to stop the war on terror. Nevertheless, he did not give up despite pressure being exerted from international corners. We need to act with a backbone. We should not be servile to any power bloc or nation.

QThe United States moved out of the UNHRC. How do you see it
The United States did so primarily because the UNHRC did not endorse the activities of Israel. We cannot justify the US action on that premise. Yet, the UNHRC becomes a weak body in the absence of the US. So, these human rights lobbyists may not have the same strength to pounce upon the countries.
From that perspective, it is an advantage for us that the US is no longer there with the UNHRC. Otherwise, we cannot condone the US action taken purely in the interests of Israel. If the US did it in protest over the UNHRC double standards towards the countries like ours, we could welcome it. After the US pulled out, then US Ambassador to Sri Lanka Atul Keshap said the UNHRC resolution on Sri Lanka would prevail.

QAmbassador Keshap, in a meeting with the Tamil National Alliance (TNA) leaders, insisted that Sri Lanka should work out a new Constitution. What is your view
It amounts to meddling with our internal affairs. How can the US dictate terms in that manner Sri Lanka is not part of the United States. We should respond in the way the President of the Philippines did to such interference once. The Philippines is a small country like ours. Yet, its leader has a backbone whereas ours dont.
Today, crimes are on the rise. We see a surge in underworld criminal activities. But the IGP is meditating. The Police should not do meditation in the face of criminal activities. When I say this, I would be criticized. One would question as to how I could oppose to meditation being a Buddhist monk.
What I meant is different. There is a specific task assigned to the Police. Meditation is not something assigned to the Police. The Police should fulfil its duty. If the Police discharges its lawful duty, the underworld will not thrive. Terrorist activities will cease in the north, then. This Government will do anything to stay in power.
Other political forces in the country insist elections as means to get into power again. Both the government and the opposition are driven by the craze for power. We are only asking them to place the country before self

Gotabaya is the best candidate in the greater interests of the country. Lawyers say there are no provable charges against him. The government may be able to take him to remand custody. But, they cannot punish him legally

QWhat do you think of the next Presidential Elections
I have a feeling that the UNP-led forces would field President Maithripala Sirisena as the common candidate again. They might field another flanker candidate to engineer a split in the Sinhala Buddhist vote base. We have learnt it from reliable sources. Then, it will be a challenge to a candidate like Gotabaya Rajapaksa. The political forces, supportive of him, are yet to contemplate strategies.
In our view, Gotabaya is the best candidate in the greater interests of the country. Lawyers say there are no proven charges against him. The government may be able to take him to remand custody. But, they cannot punish him legally because there are no legitimate charges. It is difficult for the Police to take action against him under the current circumstances.
If he is nominated as the presidential candidate as soon as possible, it will be advantageous. If the government opts to arrest him, it would then amount to the incarceration of a nominee for the Presidential Election. If he is remanded, he can contest from being behind the bars. Time is ripe for the Joint Opposition to nominate him as the Presidential candidate.

QYet, there is an objection to his candidacy according to reports...
Within the Rajapaksa family, there are no splits. I know it for a fact. All will agree to what Mahinda Rajapaksa says. Only he has the experience to do it.

Lawyers say there are no proven charges against him. The government may be able to take him to remand custody. But, they cannot punish him legally because there are no legitimate charges

QAfter the defeat of Mahinda Rajapaksa at the elections in 2015, an organization led by you undertook a task to bring him back. How do you look at it in retrospect
We initiated the struggle. The Joint Opposition took it over from us and proceeded. At the local level, we carried out our campaign, though. Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) won the Local Government polls in February, this year as a direct result of the campaign we initiated. That is the success of that campaign we spearheaded. It is making further gains now.

QYou met with Lord Baron Naseby, a member of the British House of Lords, who spoke for Sri Lanka countering allegations of war crimes. How was that meeting
The Pro-LTTE Tamil Diaspora groups are all powerful in Geneva. It is a long story. The successive Sri Lankan governments, since 1977, maintained stoic silence in the face of the LTTEs international propaganda.
So, Tamil separatist forces are more powerful than us in this sphere today. They have funding from multiple sources. MP Vijayakala Maheswaran might get a lot of funding because of her statement calling for the revival of the LTTE in recent times. It is a virtual appeal to the Tamil Diaspora asking for funding. Unfortunately, our State intelligence do not get information to this effect today.
Lord Naseby is supportive of us. However, he asked us to build a support base within Sri Lanka for his stand. He said he could ensure further support only when the support base grows in strength here.Without a support base for him in Sri Lanka, it is difficult for him to be a lone voice. The government should have invited him to Sri Lanka soon after he spoke in support of us countering allegations of war crimes. Then, his opinion becomes our opinion. It would deliver a clear message to the international community. Unfortunately, the government holds a different view. The governments position favours the pro-LTTE diaspora.

If he is nominated as the presidential candidate as soon as possible, it will be advantageous. If the government opts to arrest him, it will then amount to the incarceration of a nominee for the Presidential Election

QNow, some Sinhala organizations such as Global Sri Lanka Forum carry out propaganda to counter the Tamil Diaspora. How successful it is
It is continuing.

QWhat is your view on the Constitution-Making process
It is tottering. Let alone, the government has not abandoned it. We continue to protest against the government.

Love and hate  two sides of the same coin!
	

Asking for high positions from political authorities is generally considered a pretty dicey affair. Because if your request goes unheeded, it could mark the end of your ties with the big guy!

There is a prominent cleric who is said to have realized this home truth through this bitter experience.
This dignitary who played a lead role to bring yahapalanaya into power had asked for a portfolio related to agriculture  that too at the top level  from a high political authority. In fact, he had made the request several times. However, the high authority who, by them had got used to such requests galore, had simply ignored it.
Livid that his request had gone unheeded, our cleric severed all ties with yahapalanaya and began attacking its leaders at every turn.
And he has gone to the extent of grooming a member of his own revered community to pit against the high political authority at the upcoming big poll, they say.

Moratuwa University develops ankle exoskeleton robot
	
Amashi Weerasingha, Kasun Harshana and Kesara Withanage

Three students attached to the Bionics Laboratory of Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Moratuwa have developed an ankle exoskeleton robot. Named C-JAE, the robot is a wearable device which is able to carry out robotic rehabilitation and/or to provide locomotion assistance for human having mobility impairments. It combines human intelligence with mechanism to perform human ankle motions. 


C-JAE, the robot is a wearable device which is able to carry out robotic rehabilitation and/or to provide locomotion assistance for human having mobility impairment

		C-JAE robot is a blessing for individuals with weaker ankle
		The project has been carried out by final year undergraduates from the Department of Mechanical Engineering Amashi Weerasingha, Kasun Harshana and Kesara Withanage. It is supervised by Prof. Ruwan Gopura who is currently the youngest professor in Engineering in Sri Lanka and Head, Department of Mechanical Engineering, Engineer Pubudu Ranaweera, the senior lecturer attached to the Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Moratuwa.
Prof. Ruwan Gopura following said According to statistics around the globe, elderly populations have exceeded 10% of the total population. On the other hand, people who are suffering from neurological or muscular disorders have increased steadily. The medical industry has shown a growing interest in the use of exoskeleton robots to alleviate health care issues arising from locomotion difficulties. Considering all those facts the Department of Mechanical Engineering of the University of Moratuwa contribute their knowledge to address this issue and serve the society. 
C-JAE is derived from the terms Compatible Joint Ankle Exoskeleton, meaning articulated robotic ankle exoskeleton with compatible joint axes to generate human ankle motions.The mechanism and drive units are placed anterior to foot and shank segments. C-JAE supports all three DOF at the ankle joint using novel mechanism, while ensuring joint axes mapping for full ranges of motion. It means, with the intention of maximizing user compatibility and performance, the proposed mechanism has compatible joint axes for each DOF. 

According to statistics around the globe, elderly populations have exceeded 10% of the total population. On the other hand, people who are suffering from neurological or muscular disorders have increased steadily and exoskeleton robots provide health care issues arising from locomotion difficulties

C-JAE weighs 2.6 kg without the battery pack, which is comparably light weight and user friendly than the existent devices.

No toilets because no opening ceremonies!
	

Number One in yahapalanaya recently visited several schools during an official tour in the central province.

Whenever, Number One visits a school, he would inquire from teachers, parents and children about the shortcomings that affect them.
By the way, Number One says that the most common complaint made to him during his visits to schools is that they are short of adequate toilet facilities.
During his recent visit to schools too, teachers, parents as well as children complained to him about the lack of proper toilet facilities.
Number One while speaking to a school Principal during his recent visit, expressed his surprise over the unavailability of toilet facilities at schools when adequate funds had already been released for this purpose. The Principal then explained the reason why the political authorities at the periphery do not pay attention to the construction of toilets at schools. Ill explain the real reason, Sir, said the Principal. Politicians are glad to open school labs, school buildings etc. because they would get a chance to unveil a commemorative plaque with their names inscribed on it and make a big speech.
But when a toilet is constructed, there would be no such ceremony where they could cut a figure among the people. That is why they dont take any interest in constructing toilet facilities at schools. They are not interested in providing desks and chairs for children either for the same reason!

## Title: NPC and its duties towards people

NPC and its duties towards people
	
Our sister paper Sunday Times had carried an interesting news item in its July 29 issue about a record set by the Northern Provincial Council (NPC). The story said that the NPC had adopted 415 different resolutions during its five-year tenure that would end in two months, in October. The story further says that this works out to nearly seven resolutions a day on which sittings were held.
It is obvious that no other Provincial Council in the country has been so active in passing resolutions as the NPC has been. Sometimes it is doubtful whether any council has adopted so many resolutions from the day it was first instituted in 1988, consequent to the Indo-Lanka Accord.
One in the southern part of the country might be interested to know what actually these resolutions were and even some racially thinking person in the south might be envy of the Tamils of the Northern Province presuming that the north might have achieved a higher level of economic development within five years than what the other provinces have for the last 30 years.
Nevertheless, the Sunday Times had also revealed that the resolutions adopted by the NPC were issues that do not come within the purview of the NPC. It cited NPC resolutions to convert the Palali Airport to an international airport and the one to place issues arising from the military defeat of the LTTE before the International Criminal Court in the Hague, as examples.
We also can recall some other similar resolutions adopted by the NPC forgetting its duty towards its people who had borne the brunt of the thirty-year-long war. For instance, four months into its election the NPC headed by its Chief Minister C.V.Wigneswaran, who is also a respected former Supreme Court Judge, passed a resolution in February 2014 calling for an international probe into the alleged violations of Human Rights and international humanitarian law during the last lap of the war. The story in the Sunday Times points out how the NPC wasted its precious time on trivial and sometimes unnecessary resolutions.
One such resolution urged all institutions coming under it to display in their offices the portrait of Chief Minister Wigneswaran, while another which had been rejected by the council Chairman C.V.K. Sivagnanam sought to impose a ban on lighting crackers during funeral processions. It must be recalled that the NPC was instituted for the first time in September 2013, following international pressure on the Mahinda Rajapaksa Government to hold the elections for the council. Even the UNHRC resolution adopted in March that year called the Government to hold the election for the NPC. And also it has to be recollected that the Provincial Councils were initially meant for the Northern and the Eastern Provinces with a view to finding a lasting solution to the ethnic problem.
The J.R. Jayewardene Government created Provincial Councils in 1987 in the other seven provinces as well in order to minimize the opposition by the Sinhalese towards devolution of power to the Tamil dominated two provinces. Yet, it was the Provincial Councils in the Northern and the Eastern Provinces that had always been in turmoil until 2008 and the situation continued in the north even after that.
The NPC has now become a political forum rather than an administrative body that should look into the economic woes of the people, who are struggling to come out of destructions caused to their families and the society as a whole by the war. Besides the fighting with the Central Government over various issues, now the council was embroiled in a tussle over a Ministerial Post, which has already gone to the Supreme Court.
In a recent interview with the Daily Mirror Governor of the Northern Province, Reginald Cooray had pointed out how the NPC had over-politicised in such a manner, that it was more interested in political issues rather than the burning problems of the people.
Two months from now the NPC stands to be dissolved as its tenure expires in October. And the Government after the passage of the Provincial Councils Elections Amendment Act in a controversial manner last year created a mess in holding elections to the Provincial Councils. Hence, the NPC would come under the Governor after October.
It is time for the Northern people to take stock of the provincial administration before going for the next provincial election.

Permanency doesnt come so easy as the appointment!
	

There is a top team member in yahapalanaya who is a good go-getter. He is good at making a big noise about what he has done and is doing too.

The politico provided jobs to a large number of youth in an authority coming under his purview as trainee workers. These workers remained placed on a temporary basis even despite having completed the so-called training and worked at the authority for over two years. Getting perturbed over their job security, the workers began agitating for permanent status and the top team member asked his colleague handling finance to grant due authority to grant permanent status to these employees.
However, the Treasury bigwigs turned down the request.
Not to be outdone, the politico approached Number One for a solution to his problem. He also suggested to Number One that the workers seeking permanent status be deployed as part of the latters Grama Shakti regiment.
However, Number One declined the politicos suggestion saying that his Blue party loyalist pigeons constituting the Grama Shakti regiment could go into a panic if the Green party hawks were thrown into their midst.
Now the top team member who believes that nothing is impossible is said to be exploring new ways to find a solution to his problem, they say.

They were lying on two beds placed close to each other awaiting body massage, when the tuition master addressed the Kalutara pal in a hushed tone: If you dont mind, Saho, I wish to know why you suddenly developed an ambition to become the countrys Number One!
I dont mind at all, replied the ambitious one. In fact, everyone ought to know that I have a right to a leadership position in the country. Do you know, Saho, that I am the most senior member in the Hand party after one or two front-liners in it Therefore, dont think that I am pressing my claim for the top position from public platform out of sheer madness!
The tuition master did not argue the point made by his colleague probably because it did not come within his domain Economics, they say.

Some writers whose political insensitivities and bare naivet have been mistaken for objective analysis are still defending the indefensible atrocities of the Rajapaksa era. Their insensitivities have taken them from being mere Rajapaksa supporters to the fringe politics of post-Independent Sri Lanka. Ceylon, as it was called then, has undergone unrecognizable changes; she has embraced nihilist aspects of political evolution; ethnic violence has erupted multiple times and led to a thirty-year long war that ended in the decimation of a terrorist army that was never seen before in Ceylon in the last half of the millennium. That war has enlarged the gulf between the two parties. Tamils are being perceived as the enemy of the glorious past of Sinhalese Buddhists, as enunciated in the Great Chronicle (Mahawansa).
The peak of this evolutionary thought, as promulgated by the modern day patriots of the land, the race and the faith, spearheaded by an insane but utterly focused movement led by saffron-garbed political gangsters, was in the Rajapaksa era: from 2005 to 2014. During this maddeningly-chaotic period, these pundits and Chinthanaya demagogues would most conveniently forget to write about or even make a cursory mention on the alleged exchange of huge amounts of cash between the candidate Rajapaksa and Prabhakaran, leader of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Elam (LTTE). Prabhakaran got the cash and Mahinda Rajapaksa got the Tamils in the North to stay at their homes on the D-day, presidential election day, thereby preventing an assured bloc of votes for Ranil Wickremesinghe, the UNP candidate who would have been sufficient to overwhelm the votes received by Mahinda in 2005.

18 A to our already sullied Constitution not only assured the Rajapaksas a mirage of permanent power, it also carried a latent message to the hereunto placid population and civil organisations a weapon to use

Yet, those who bartered the countrys conscience for cash then clothed themselves with a glorious-looking attire of patriotism, while those soldiers of the ilk of General Sarath Fonseka were disgraced as traitors. This grave injustice caused to the sublime emotions of a nation struggling to rise from the ashes of a terrorist war is unpardonable. Desecration of mans strongly-held belief in himself and his family was accepted by the henchmen and women of the ruling cabal as a patriotic act for the wild emotions raised and inflamed by empty rhetoric and resounding slogans overtook the wiser senses of man. The decay that followed in our cultural values and social measures began to show their external manifestations, not gradually but rather rapidly and uncontrollably.
At the base of all these processes of rotting away and social oozing was a politician. Politician controlled not only the countrys coffers; he controlled the hearts and minds of the general population; thereby they controlled the mindset of a great number of people, in fact a majority of Sinhalese Buddhists. The so-called pundits and pseudo intellectuals of the Chinthanaya-trash were at the very core of this repugnant movement. Construction of beautiful slogans that would easily mesmerize the gullible and plainly vacant minds of a majority which has already been hoodwinked by wickedly-attired thugs misrepresenting the Order of Maha Sangha, the clergy of Buddhist preaching, gave way for insightful thinking and wise decision-making.
Sharpening the television portraits to misrepresent the vile and inscrutably-dangerous political philosophy, which was already bordering on Nazism and Stalinism, became a priority of highest order for those who occupied the uppermost seats of power. The resultant mindset of the Rajapaksa cabal that became more and more hallucinated and intoxicated with power produced the most undemocratic constitutional amendment thus far. The 18th Amendment to our already sullied Constitution not only assured the Rajapaksas a mirage of permanent power, it also carried a latent message to the hereunto placid population and civil organisations a weapon to use and use repeatedly to prove that the path the Rajapaksas have chosen is not good for the country. In other words, 18A carried within itself a double-edged knife, one edge for the Rajapaksas to continue their supremacy forever and the other as an eye-opener for the docile public that the intentions of the cabal are not so voter-friendly.
In order to bury the ugly Sri Lankan that dwelled within the Rajapaksa ruling cabal and their numerous castrations of human rights, decent life and honest livelihoods of the average man and woman, holding on to power was a prerequisite. This same argument was made in 1988 when J.R. Jayewardene, the very creator of the Presidential Constitution and then its government, was getting ready to hand over the reins of power to the next one who would be elected. At that time, J.R. Jayewardene had a two-thirds majority in Parliament. The passage of an amendment on lines of the 18th Amendment would have been reasonably easy. Yet, JR decided otherwise. Wiser minds prevailed.

When the siblings started tasting the sweetness of power, when they began reaping the harvests of hardworking men and women, the alluring enigma of power took control of these siblings

When the siblings started tasting the sweetness of power, when they began reaping the harvests of hardworking men and women in Sri Lanka, the alluring enigma of power took control of these siblings. They let themselves go. And the subject people suffered. The daylight murder of Lasantha Wickrematunge, assault on other journalists, killing of Tamil journalists in Jaffna, intimidation and abduction of Prageeth Ekneligoda, Rathupaswala shooting and obliteration of those who took part in the infamous prison riots were all direct and unmistakable results of the mindset that controlled the country after the passage of 18A.
The Presidential elections held in 2015 changed all that, hopefully forever. Revocation of 18A and replacing it with the 19th Amendment, in combination with many a legal and judicial investigation into the misdeeds of the former first family gave them jitters. The provision of proportional representation (PR system) has ensured that it is practically impossible for any single party to gain a two-thirds majority in Parliament. One party might be able to command a two-thirds majority after ensuring the support of some other fringe parties to form a temporary two-thirds for a specific purpose, but such temporary collusions are hardly worthy of mention in the context of a bitterly fought out election campaign which would result in a hung-Parliament. Consequently, seeing Mahinda Rajapaksa again on the throne of presidency is a non-event.
This series of events and their developments have resulted in a wild and misguided hunt for the seat of power in 2020. The former Defence Secretary, a sibling of Mahinda who was falsely named as the architect of the war victory in 2009, seems to be engaged in a furious campaign for 2020 Presidential elections. Claims of the then Defence Secretary as the architect of the war victory is a tremendous disservice and insult to some of the best military minds and brave soldiers who paid the ultimate price for the nations sake. Launching a campaign on a totally false and obnoxious base is not going to be successful. That campaigns main star will be defined in terms of these untruths and falsifications.
In the midst of all this, the other brother who was supposed to be in charge of the countrys economy is said to be pretty angry that a person who ran away from the country when the worst part of the war against the Tamil militants was on is being portrayed as the next Presidential candidate. On top of that, it is also rumored that the former first lady too is vehemently opposed to the former Defence Secretary as their family-candidate. Mahinda has an impending implosion in his midst. In the grand mosaic of political development, each piece seems to be in the wrong place making the mosaic look more like a jigsaw puzzle rather than an artistic creation.
Mahinda Rajapaksa has a choice. He also has an obligation to unite the forces that displaced him from power in 2015. He has lost control and leadership of his original political party, Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP). Yet, an overwhelming majority, close to 90% of that party, is now with him under a new name, Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP). However, erosion of even 5% of votes from the SLPP would mean certain defeat at a Presidential election, because an overwhelming minority vote consisting of Tamils and Muslims is still against the Rajapaksas. The implosion is coming.

SAITM no more, staff should request salaries from President: Dr. Fernando
	
SAITM founder Dr. Neville Fernando said that as the SAITM Institute was abolished by President Maithripala Sirisena the staff should ask him for their salaries.
There is no academic activity at SAITM since it was abolished. So, there isnt any need for staff. As there is no income Im unable to pay them. The staff should ask their salaries from the President, who took the decision to abolish the institution, he said.
SAITM in an announcement issued on August 4, 2017, halted student intake, however, it had paid the staff until May.
According to an employee, academic staff salaries had been paid until the month of May while other staff cadres were not paid their July salary.
They said that since the beginning Dr. Fernando had managed the business in an arbitrary manner and even though a financial crisis existed Dr. Fernando had attempted to hire the remaining staff making false promises that their salaries would be paid.
They stressed that although Dr. Fernando had no money to pay their salaries as he had started a business in Hokandara. The disturbed employees added that SAITM should follow the standard protocols when closing down a business by compensating them before sending them home. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

Security lapse sparks evacuation at Frankfurt airport
	

REUTERS, 07th AUGUST, 2018-Parts of Frankfurt airport were evacuated for several hours on Tuesday, disrupting travel during the busy summer holiday season, after a French family of four bypassed security checks, federal police said on Tuesday.
The police said on Twitter that affected areas had been re-opened, allowing passengers as well as airport and airline employees to return to parts of Terminal 1 that had been closed temporarily.
They gave no details on how the family had been able to get past security without being stopped.
At Frankfurt, a major hub for international travel and home to airline Lufthansa, the schedule had foreseen 1,500 flights taking off and landing on Tuesday, according to airport operator Fraport.
Lufthansa had to halt boarding at the A and Z levels of the airports Terminal 1 during the evacuation but said it could not yet say how many flights would be cancelled or delayed as a result.

SA may have already won the series 3-0 but the remaining two matches of this series are far from being meaningless. With Faf Du Plessis out due to injury, Quinton De Kock has been made captain for the rest of the tour and he will be keen to prove that he is a worthy candidate for being next South Africa skipper. The Saffers will also look to sweep the series for good measure as a response to the defeat they suffered in the Test matches before this. A beleaguered Sri Lanka, on the other hand, will be hoping to salvage some pride in this match and the next one.

## Title: Sri Lanka is losing its Mangrove forests!
## Section: News Features

Sri Lanka is losing its Mangrove forests!
	
This pivotal coastal ecosystem is threatened by Human settlements in the coastal areas and the unhealthy growth of the tourism sector
Mangroves are a valuable ecological and economic resource to Sri Lanka. According to the Department of Forest Conversation, Sri Lanka is home to over 20 mangrove species. These mangroves extend over an area of 15,670 hectares. However, mangroves represent only 0.2% of the total forest cover. 

Mangroves and the economy
The coastal, inland and offshore fisheries contributed 1.3% of the GDP of Sri Lanka in 2017. However, there has been a decline in coastal fishery production by 5.3% while inland aquaculture, shrimp, and prawn production declined by 7.9 % and 23.4 % compared to 2016. Mangrove depletion is considered as being among the reasons for this depletion, indicating that the survival and healthy growth of mangroves are crucial components in the sustainability of the fishing industry. 
Mangroves in Sri Lanka provide wood and timber for housing, firewood, and charcoal to coastal households. Almost 75% of the coastal population extracts firewood from mangrove forests. The coastal community also depends on mangroves for bottle caps and ornamental production. 
Ecological services
Mangroves are pivotal coastal ecosystems and play a key role in weathering climate change impacts such as storms, hurricanes, and tsunamis while mitigating its causes. The value of mangroves in carbon sequestration is higher than terrestrial forests. Mangrove forests absorb up to four times more carbon per hectare than other tropical forests. This unique ecosystem also provides a nursery habitat for many wildlife species, including commercial fish and crustaceans, and contributes to sustaining the local abundance of fish and shellfish populations. Mangroves also provide shelter and feeding grounds to many reptiles and nesting grounds for local and migratory birds. 
Further, mangroves facilitate the growth of corals and provide shelter for coral species exposed to the risk of extinction from coral bleaching. Coral bleaching is one of the calamitous effects of climate change, and it is worsened by the absorption of more carbon by the oceans. Several species such as seagrass beds cannot survive without mangroves, and it is vital to ensure that mangroves are protected as they can withstand sea level rise and help mitigate coastal erosion. 
Impacts of climate on Mangroves
A large percentage of mangrove populations in Sri Lanka has been subjected to depletion and deforestation as a result of anthropogenic activities as well as natural disasters. They have been threatened by natural disasters while functioning as a buffer and protecting the coast. During the 2004 Tsunami, most of the mangroves along the Southern belt were destroyed. With the intensity of climate change and natural perils rising, more and more mangroves are destroyed and the time needed for recovery gets extended. 
The human threat
Human settlements in the coastal areas threaten mangroves. With one third of the population in Sri Lanka living along the coastal belt, and human settlements in the coastal areas of Sri Lanka ever expanding, the waste disposals of these human settlements cause a significant threat to coastal ecosystems such as mangroves. Even though mangroves are resilient to disturbances, the pollutants cause considerable damage to them. 
Mangroves are highly threatened by the unprecedented and unhealthy growth of the tourism sector. They are being deforested to build tourist resorts and infrastructure as well as to have a better view of the ocean. The roots, fruits, and flowers of particular species of mangroves are also being used to create ornaments and lids at unsustainable levels. With increasing consumer demand for shrimps and the expansion of export-oriented prawn farming, more mangrove forests have been lost. 
Conventions, Mandates, and Legal Protection
At the international level, the most widespread convention for the protection of mangroves is the Convention on Wetlands or the Ramsar Convention of 1975. Sri Lanka is Party to this convention which came into effect in 1990 and has 6 Ramsar sites. 
The mission of the Convention is the conservation and wise use of all wetlands through local and national actions and international cooperation, as a contribution towards achieving sustainable development throughout the world. [...] [T]he Contracting Parties commit to work towards the wise use of all their wetlands; designate suitable wetlands for the list of Wetlands of International Importance (the Ramsar List) and ensure their effective management; and cooperate internationally on transboundary wetlands, shared wetland systems and shared species. 
At the national level, the legal mandate to protect mangroves falls under the Coast Conservation Department, the Forest Department, and the Department of Wildlife Conservation. However, there are gaps and constraints in the law enforcement against encroachers of marshlands due to legal limitations, and conflicts in existing laws. The National Adaptation Plan of Sri Lanka also focuses on mangroves under Sri Lankas climate actions. 
Rehabilitating process
The reforestation of mangroves, native to the reforestation location, is essential to avoid an ecological imbalance. Research shows that in the restoration efforts conducted in Sri Lanka, approximately 200-220ha out of 1,000-1,200ha have showed successful restoration. 
While the conservation efforts of the Sri Lanka Mangrove Conservation Project run by the Ministry of Mahaweli Development and Environment with assistance from the US Seacology Institute is commendable, Sri Lanka needs an appropriate all-island restoration programme that involves the local communities whose livelihoods are dependent on mangroves and who better understand the interdependence between this ecosystem and their lives. 
It is important to consider that women are key stakeholders (which is the case in the Sri Lanka Mangrove Conservation Project) at the national as well as sub-national level in initiatives focusing on mangroves.

## Title: The 68th Bellanwila Esala Perahera : A tribute to late Ven. Prof. Wimalarathana
## Section: News Features

The 68th Bellanwila Esala Perahera : A tribute to late Ven. Prof. Wimalarathana
	
The annual historic Bellanvila Esela Perahera (Pageant), the 68th in the series, began parading the streets in July. This year the greatest strength behind this much looked forward to event is the fact that its dedicated to Ven Prof. Bellanvila WimalarathanaThera. The monk was subject to an untimely death, and his absence in Buddhist activities is considered a great loss. All activities throughout the pageant will be carried out in memory of the late priest. 
			
			
		
			The late Ven. Prof. Wimalarathana Thera
			
			
		Its a well-known fact that the concept of this pageant was the brainchild of the late Ven. Bellanwila Somarathana Thera. This majestic street pageant has come a long way, thanks to the guidance all the organisers received from Ven. Dr. Bellanvila Wimalarathana Thero. The monk was the Chief Sanghanayaka of Singapore and the Viharadhipathi (chief monk) of Bellanvila Temple. 
Ven. Dhammarathana Thero is committed to continue this esteemed religious festival with the support of the other priests and members of the pageants organizing committee. 
Ven. Prof. Bellanvila Wimalarathana Thera was the chief architect of this pageant. It was started as a ceremony to bless the people and their cattle during times of famine and epidemics in the Bellanvila area. However, the pageant has gradually grown into a religious and cultural festival. This year its Organizing Committee will pay special tribute to the Late Thera so as to appreciate his years of service to the country and the people. 
This ceremony includes three days of religious sermons (Dhamma Desana) which draw devotees to the historic Bellanwila temple. Invoking of blessings starts with a week-long Pirith (chanting). This is followed by the Deva-dootha Perahera, Dorakada Asna, Kumbal Perahera, Mal Perahera, Paawada Perahera, Ransivili Perahera, Diya Kapana Perehera and Deva Daanaya along with many other ceremonies. 
In this consumerist society, it is no secret that people have to deal with lifes challenges on a regular basis. A temple is a place that gives such people much relief. One such place is the Bellanvila Rajamaha Viharaya, which over the years, has given the people the confidence to face lifes challenges through spiritual upliftment. 
In addition to that, the Bellanvila Temple provides many services to the community throughout the year. 


Dhamma Education
There are two Dhamma schools which function in English and Sinhala mediums respectively. In addition to offering support to school children, who study Buddhism in both languages, it also enhances their knowledge of English. The Sri Somarathana Memorial Programme also provides scholarships to school children from low income families. This is a huge relief to parents who struggle to find the means to pay for school materials. 

Skill building
The Temple provides technical and industrial training to youth which includes lathe work and welding. This training along with skills in English and the knowledge of the Japanese language are offered free of charge to young people in the area. 
The Vocational Training Centre has been in existence for over 30 years. The number of students who enroll at the Centre post Ordinary Level exams has increased over the years. The Centre continues to offer these opportunities and those who have enrolled are reaping the benefits of all this training. 

Housing construction
The Temple also builds cost effective houses for the less affluent, annually. This is considered an incredible service and a support to those from low income families in the area. 

Health
The entire income from the car park goes into the health programme. These monies are especially used to provide financial assistance to patients who undergo surgery. Approximately 50,000 rupees is provided every month to many people. The temple offers these services without seeking publicity. 
The Temple also conducts health clinics where Government doctors offer their services voluntarily. Lab tests are also done and this is an invaluable service to low income families. Especially, the cost of diagnostic tests are extremely expensive and this clinic eases that burden. Going to a Government hospital at 5 a.m is difficult; especially for ailing and ageing patients. Hence this service is greatly appreciated, as it is a reach-out programme for the needy. 
In addition to this, vision tests are also done and spectacles are donated during eye clinics. 

Assisting other temples
Every year the Nayaka Thero selects a temple in a faraway place and supports it in many ways. Starting with an almsgiving, essential utensils are provided to these temples. Robes are offered to the monks while books are also provided to the children visiting the temple. Individual assistance is also provided to priests. 

Providing flood assistance
During the recent floods, the temple was instrumental in collecting dry rations for those affected. The temple authorities then distributed these aid items in collaboration with the Government. While many groups and media institutions sought publicity during this calamity, this temple offered its services in silence in offering food to landslide victims. 

Pageant
Coming back to our main topic this month, it should be acknowledged that the pageant is undoubtedly one of the most beautiful and colourful of its kind to be held in the country. The representatives of the Pageants Committee also provide opportunities to students of traditional dance to display their skills. The dance segment importantly includes dance forms of various parts in the country. In this aspect there is no discrimination to anybody. Hence the organisers include up country dance, dancing forms from the low country and Sabaragamu. The Perahera in Bellanwila is unique in providing opportunities for men, women and children, who wish to take part in the pageant. The authorities dont allow women to take part in these pageants.
This is one event which goes beyond commercial norms; other such pageants enjoy exclusive sponsorships. Even traditional business rivals come together to sponsor the Bellanvila Esela Pageant. Although there have been many changes in society, the religious and cultural features of the pageant have been protected and passed to the next generation.
Not only Buddhists, but Hindus, Christians and those belonging to the Islamic faith have offered support for this pageant. This has been done with the motive of bringing everyone together. The pageant gives an opportunity to vendors to make significant profits through sales. Pineapple, achchaaru and gram sellers can earn during the pageant what they usually make during the entire month. All this was the vision and concepts of the Late Thera. His absence is seriously felt during this period. His knowledge of many things and healthy attitude-to help people-always bubbled to the surface during past festivals. Hence the people of the area were ever so grateful to him. 
The pageant will be telecast live on television. There are plans to make details of the pageant available on the world wide web for the benefit of international viewers. With the members of the pageants committee hoping to promote this even with the Tourist Board from next year, more foreigners are expected to visit the Temple to witness the pageant in the future.

Why they enter politics in the first place: Lessons For Jemima Khan
	
 When the wives are perturbed by pricks of conscience 

....my sons father is Pakistans
next PM. Its an incredible lesson in
tenacity, belief & refusal to accept
defeat. The challenge now is to
remember why he entered politics in
the 1st place. Congratulations

- Jemima Khan
on Twitter

Imran Khan must have felt sentimental when he read the tweet from his first wife Jemima congratulating him on Twitter.
That tweet must have rung a bell with any conscious voter in Sri Lanka; very unlikely that it would do so with a politician, though. In that Jemima is reminding Imran that he must keep the promises made to the populace who in turn has taken a veritable risk by electing an outsider in preference over seasoned politicos.
Lets turn to Sri Lanka with Jemimas caveat for Imran in mind, shall we What could be the main reasons that voters opted to choose the leaders that they did in the first place; lets take the Presidential Election as a reference point. Abolishment of the Executive Presidency, for starters Eradicating corruption, obviously Ensuring good governance, undoubtedly
If Jemima was tweeting to a Sri Lankan Presidential candidate, she would be destined to be sorely disappointed, wouldnt she
Imrans Victory has emboldened those wanting a non-political figure as Presidential Candidate locally. There is a web group called Apita one Sanga (It is Sanga that we want). Well, if it wasnt for Sanga, one would have thought that it was a site opened by the prospective candidate himself, as is the normal case in Sri Lanka. Yet, the Sanga we know, would not resort to such gimmicks and therefore we could safely conclude it is some group, at least, who want a personality like him on the political stage. We remember how Sanga politely declined the UK High Commissioner designation citing personal commitments to his family. I cannot help but wonder, if Sanga by any chance accepts the candidacy and gets elected, how his beloved wife Yehali would send him a message, along the lines of what Jemima sent to Imran i.e. that he should never set his eyes away from what made him enter politics, most probably against his initial reluctance.

The Tryst
There is a perennial problem with the Sri Lankan mentality which is magnified manifold when it translates into electoral aspirations of the populace, the majority in particular. The credulous belief in individual personalities of messianic proportions to deliver them from all evils. They did so with Chandrika, then Mahinda, some with Sarath and most of them with Maithri. They have done so with Ranil too, intermittently. Yet, no Moses has led them over the proverbial Red Sea of corruption and decay.
Such bitter disillusionment with traditional leaders creates a throbbing desire to do a Macron or an Imran, at least, cometh the next election. 2020 election will witness an upsurge of independent candidates from civil society and professional spheres and they might do well compared to such aspirants in the past.
My concern lies elsewhere. With whom are they going to rule Who will form their inner core of decision makers Again going by the example of Sanga, can he do a mid-pitch dialogue with Mahela or Matthews as he did while being at the helm of Sri Lankan Cricket Such reliable counsel is so scarce in the political field, isnt it

Systems and personnel
There is a lot of hype about the former Defence Secretary Gotabaya being a contender provided legal obstacles related to his dual citizenship are solved in his favour. The question arises yet again: Who will be his top flankers Is it the retired military men, who demand the death penalty for academics and see all dissent as a hallmark of traitors The rub lies here: The absence of systems, structures and personnel equipped for and interested in the ideals that the electorate expect from such figures, vitiates against any salutary outcome that might be wrought out from the election of such a candidate.
Those who have been lobbying for apolitical candidates here will naturally be buoyed by the victory of the cricket star of Pakistan and will press their case further. In any event, the uncertainty among mainstream parties regarding their Presidential /Prime Ministerial candidates in an upcoming election fortifies the chances of such a character emerging from oblivion (in a political sense) vis--vis known and now stale personalities, who are either incapable or uninterested in making their priority, the country.
Imran faces a lot of challenges in leading Pakistan forward; it is one of the most vulnerable democracies in the entire world and a security hotspot that concerns superpowers such as the US and Western allies. India and China too have interests in the election result for different purposes. Ensuring that representative democracy does not expire prematurely in this war-torn country will be first and foremost in the mind of Imran and his aides. The question of alleviating poverty comes next. Yet, the underlying election promise that he gave his countrymen of wiping out corruption will be the yardstick of his performance.

If he wants to
If Imran wants to stay focused on the reasons that made him enter politics in the first place and deliver goods, he has a unique opportunity. He does not have skeletons in the cupboard or the baggage that normally accumulates over time when you are a mainstream politician.
Certainly with regard to those unholy connections and relationships that politicos develop behind the curtain with businessmen, underworld and those with vested interests hardly burdens him. As the yahapalana experiment in Sri Lanka shows, even if your hands are not slimy with corruption, a long history of political and non-political allegiances and affiliations tend to arm-twist leaders in tackling issues such as corruption-thus the promises were given and expectations raised by the electorate scarcely see the daylight of materialisation.
Yes, if he wants to, Imran has an unprecedented opportunity; he has the support of his former wife too. But that is if he wants to do so.
In our context, in particular, how sad that the wives or the loved ones of those elected to political office, do not remind them to stick to the promises they made on their way to the top Maybe I am wrong. Perhaps they do, and the messages from their wives (or ex-wives for that matter) would read very similar to Jemimas.
Honey, do not forget the penthouse the stock market company promised us, ok
Darling, what about the Chairmanship of that Airliner for my brother 
Have you forgotten about the hotel project in the heart of Knuckles
Oh, no! They never fail to make those reminders. The wives are so perturbed by these pricks of conscience. Just like Jemima Khan, they are actually reminding their spouses what they entered politics for in the first place! We are a blessed lot to have such loved ones to remind our leaders of such things!
Maybe Jemima is due for a lesson or two from them, after all!
