Case against Ranjan Ramanayake: SC asks AG to file draft rule on July 30
	
The Supreme Court today directed the Attorney General to submit draft rule on July 30 against Deputy Minister Ranjan Ramanayake to show cause as to why he should not be charged in respect of the two petitions alleging him to have committed Contempt of Court.
When the matter was taken up by a Bench comprising Chief Justice Priyasath Dep, Justices Priyantha Jayawardane and Murdu N.B. Fernando, President?s Counsel M.A. Sumanthiran with Jerusha Crossette Thambiah appearing for Mr. Ramanayake said the procedure should be followed in all courts according to Section 793 of the Criminal Procedure Code Chapter 9.
He said as such the person who complains should forward the summons containing the charges to be served on the respondent and that the Attorney General had no role in the proceedings.
Additional Solicitor General Priyantha Navana appearing for the AG cited former minister S.B. Dissanayake?s case and said the procedure followed in that case was that it was the AG who drafted the Rule for Contempt.
Counsel Sumanthiran said that case could not be followed because the expressed provision of the law was not followed and the practice of the Court could not override the expressed provision of law.
Petitioners Sunil Perera and Ven. Magalkande Sudaththa Thera are seeking contempt of court action against the Deputy Minister Ranjan Ramanayake alleging that he had made an insulting statement at a news conference on August 21 damaging the reputation of the Judiciary and the Lawyers. Rasika Tissanayake with Suraj Walgama appeared for the petitioners.
Petitioners said the statement was made at a time when the international community and organizations were trying to force the country to establish special courts to charge war heroes.

Getting high ? a different view of the ocean?s giants
	
Aerial whale watching is exhilarating and I recently got the opportunity to relive this experience. Having watched whales and dolphins from boats, seeing them from up in the air was a totally different experience. I was spellbound by the iridescent silhouettes of whales and the dance-like movements of dolphins.?
The magnificent giants can be appreciated in their natural habitat better when you watch them from air. Unlike going whale watching in a boat, you hardly disturb the surrounding waters. Furthermore, the sight of a whole blue whale from above, rather than the tip of the fin or tail, is so overwhelming and is an experience you get only with the bird?s eye view from a plane. The blue whale is the world?s largest mammal, and you see them a plenty in our seas. Who would ever think that this little island is blessed in abundance with some of the world?s significant marine life phenomena?
May is definitely not the peak season to see marine life due to the monsoons, but my mode of travel meant that this was not going to hinder my sighting, for I saw 7 blue whales within 45 minutes! It is indeed way more than one could see during off season.
CESSNA-172
My journey to the southern coast to watch the whales and dolphins was made through Fairway Air, or F-Air as they are known. Their 3 seater planes require a bit of getting used to for those with space concerns, but the sights you get to feast your eyes upon once you are up there more than make up for it. Aerial whale watching is also a good option considering the time you spend, which is lesser than what you would to go out into the ocean by boat.?
The bonus you get in air travel to watch the whales is that you also get to appreciate the beauty of the southern coast from high up above. The flight covers the island?s best beaches like Weligama and the southernmost tip of Sri Lanka and the Dondra light house, to mention a few.?
The journey was incredible and the pictures speak for themselves. This is an experience one should definitely add to the bucket list!

Govt. won?t hold PC polls before presidential poll: PHU
	
The Pivithuru Hela Urumaya (PHU) today said the government won?t hold Provincial Council (PC) elections prior to the presidential election in fear of a PC poll defeat and also to avoid recurrence of any political conflicts.
Addressing a news briefing, PHU Leader and MP Udaya Gammanpila said the government?s announcement that PC elections would be held in December 2018 was another false hope.
?Both the UNP and the JVP together introduced an electorate method for provincial council election by amending the Provincial Council Election Act in September 2017,?with a view to postpone the election showing delimitation of electorates as an excuse. The Prime Minister assured that elections would be held before March 2018. Neither the JVP nor the UNP utter a single word about delimitation today,? he said.
He said if PC elections are held before the presidential election, the SLPP will be able to secure power in seven out of nine councils.
?The SLPP will be able to use this strong provincial network for its presidential election campaign. Therefore, the government wants to hold the presidential elections when provincial councils have been dissolved,? he said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

Hassan Esufally takes on the Big Five Marathon in South Africa
	
Hassan Esufally will take on his fifth continent in his goal of completing marathons in all seven continents, when he competes in the Big Five Marathon in South Africa in June.
Runners from all over the world are gearing up for this exclusive Marathon, which will be held on June 23. The Marathon takes runners through spectacular game reserves in South Africa, through the savannah and wild habitats of Africa?s ?Big 5? species: Elephant, Rhino, Buffalo, Lion and Leopard. No fences, no rivers, nothing at all separates the runners from the African wildlife!?
The magnificent surroundings and the thrill of running alongside giraffes and other wild species does not alter the fact that the Big Five Marathon is considered the most grueling marathon on the African continent.
The challenging course takes competitors through valleys and plateaus, over hills and through rivers, often running in scorching heat and in dusty terrain. The cut off time for this extremely challenging, full marathon of 42.195 km is only 7 hours.?
Hassan Esufally aims to become the first Sri Lankan to complete one of the world?s most grueling marathon feats ? running a full marathon in all seven continents of the world. Achieving this feat will propel him into a unique and exclusive club of the world?s greatest marathon runners ? the 7 Continents Marathon Club?.
?I have been doing both training and fasting due to Ramazan and it has been a very challenging month for me physically,? Esufally says. ?But I have managed to adapt and change my training, eating and sleeping schedule accordingly.??
I also want to add that given my previous experience in Boston due to adverse weather (something out of my control) I will have a contingency plan in place.
Esufally has already completed marathons in the continents of Australia (Melbourne Marathon in 2014 and 2016), Europe (Stockholm Marathon in June 2017), Asia (Colombo Marathon in October 2017) and North America (Boston Marathon in April 2018).
His next two marathons are unique and Hassan will be the first Sri Lankan to attempt both of them. In August, he will be in South America where he will participate in the INCA Trail Marathon, which is the toughest marathon in the world. Finally, in December this year, he competes in the 14th Antarctic Ice Marathon in Antarctica.
The 7 Continents Marathon Club? is an exclusive club of elite marathon runners who have completed some of the most grueling marathons in the world. At present, there are less than 300 members worldwide. The Club is extremely exclusive and reserved for athletes who are carefully vetted to prove they have run a marathon within the Antarctic Circle on the Antarctica continent, as well as on the other six continents.

## Title: Myth of  Self-Employment

Myth of  Self-Employment
	
Almost every time Sri Lanka?s massive rural unemployment problem is discussed, many tend to suggest self-employment as the best possible solution. Self-employment is also at the heart of the debate on predatory microfinance ravaging the rural economy. Liberal economists, government officials and NGO propagandists worry that the curtailment or abolition of microfinance would mean the end of self-employment programmes.? ?
Over the last few decades, microfinance and self-employment were promoted as the twin solution to the woes of rural folk and the urban poor. In fact, microfinance led self-employment as one central programme of neoliberal economic policies have become so ideologically entrenched that their devastating impacts are rarely questioned. Any effort to address or think through the problematic aspects of such self-employment schemes always results in discussions of ?how can we do it better? and ?why don?t beneficiaries work harder.?
This microfinance and self-employment combination is neither accidental in its emergence nor free of exploitative social and economic consequences. For that reason, microfinance and self-employment schemes should be abolished. However, there remains the challenge of finding credible alternatives for the generation of incomes and social welfare in the rural and urban arenas. ?
Informal sector and finance
Historically, there was a major shift in global political economy in the 1970s. The social welfare state came under attack with the global capitalist economic downturn after the long western post-World War II economic boom in the 1950s and 1960s. In the Third World, a serious crisis emerged a few decades after decolonization characterized by continuing neo-colonial policies that increased national debt in tandem with the changing terms of trade. That crisis punctured hopes of the promise of postcolonial development by the 1970s, and brought to the fore major challenges with deprived populations in the rural regions and rapidly increasing numbers of urban poor.? ?
The conjuncture in the 1970s leading to the consolidation of neoliberalism, both as an ideology and as a set of state practices reshaped both economic thinking and policies. The emphasis on the individual responsibility for economic life as opposed to state supported social welfare services, and capitalist accumulation centred on finance capital as opposed to industrial capital, subsequently forged a new dynamic between labour and capital in the periphery. With the economic crisis in the countryside and the urban shanties, this sector of the economy was newly termed as the ?informal?, and was eventually projected as the domain of self-employment and microfinance.? ?
Internationally, rather than seeing self-employment and microfinance as the last resort of an evidently failing capitalist system, both concepts were celebrated by donor agencies and their evangelists as mechanisms to ?liberate? working people in the informal sector. Microfinance was in particular glorified, including with a Nobel Prize for Muhammad Yunus of Bangladesh, for masking the dangerous impact of the global capitalist crisis on the marginalized in underdeveloped countries. Self-employment became the catch phrase that would disguise the high levels of unemployment and underemployment. In the developing world, as in the case of Sri Lanka, the donor agencies and state policies reinforce microfinance and self-employment as the solution for the rural and urban poor. ?
Predatory loans and entrepreneurship
In Sri Lanka, microfinance and self-employment have been promoted by the donor agencies with grants and loans, NGOs through subsidized schemes, and even state policy. However, it is in the war-torn districts that such programmes were promoted aggressively as the solution to post-war rural development. Over the last year in particular, the exploitative character of the predatory microfinance has become increasingly evident from peoples? protests ? the major protest last Thursday was by women?s groups mobilizing in the four Vanni districts in the North ? as well as statements by top government officials.? ?
In this context, the rhetorical cloak for the defence of microfinance schemes continues to be the possibility of self-employment income generation. There is now ample evidence that even the finance companies registered with the Central Bank charge annualized interest rates on the order of 40% to 70% for their microfinance loans. The aggressive manner in which microfinance lending increased is evident from data (Central Bank Annual Report 2017), where non-bank finance companies loans increased from Rs. 42 billion in 2009 to Rs. 476 billion in 2017.? ?
The ridiculousness of the microfinance story today is the belief or claim in some quarters that rural women who raise loans from the registered finance companies and other microfinance institutions on the order of 40% to 220% interest rates can make returns on such capital above such tremendous exploitative interest rates and make a living. The charade continues with talk about making rural people into entrepreneurs through self-employment. And when such self-employed people fail, it is made to be their fault for being lazy, for not trying harder or not being innovative.? ?
In reality, self-employment has failed not just with predatory loans but even with subsidised loans, because only a fraction of people in any society, and that too with considerable social capital and support, can make it as entrepreneurs. That the success or failure of such self-employed production and attendant incomes depends on the tremendous fluctuations in the market are never considered. Rather the self-employed are expected to find affordable inputs, find the market for their produce and even bear the consequences of natural disasters.
?
	Historically, there was a major shift in global political economy in the 1970s
	
	
	In SL, microfinance and self-employment have been promoted by the donor agencies
	
	
	Self-employment failed not just with predatory loans but even with subsidised loans
	
?
?
Self-employment became the catch word for neoliberal policies as the state was pushed to abdicate its responsibility towards its citizens including to create decent work and employment. In perpetuating this myth of self-employed rural entrepreneurship it transferred the economic burden solely on to the rural households. Wealthy entrepreneurs can attempt and fail at many start-up companies, but they will not starve. The so-called rural entrepreneur on the other hand will be mired in a debt trap, her family malnourished and her children?s education disrupted. The cycle of poverty would cripple her. ?
Economic burden and society
From high-level state officials down to village officials, from the international donors down to the local NGOs, lessons are rarely learnt about the failure of their ?livelihood schemes? consisting of raising chickens, tailoring training, seaweed growing to the newest and latest self-employment idea. That production has always been collective and while community support in the rural arena is not considered, as the self-employment livelihood schemes tear apart communities. Individual are expected to fend for themselves. Public and social responsibility by the state and society for its citizens is conveniently forgotten.? ?
That is the power of neoliberal ideology, it has transferred the burden of economic life to the individual, or to the self as in the self-employed. As Margaret Thatcher famously said, ?there is no such thing as society.? Are we going to accept that neoliberal rejection of society? Or are we going to find avenues to rebuild society? In my view, rebuilding society has to begin with the rejection of the flawed conception of self-employment, and the search for strengthening collective forms of production and economic life.? ?
As moves to restrict microfinance mount including with demands for write offs of predatory loans and interest rate caps, the disastrous programmes of self-employment should also be rejected. The role of social institutions such as co-operatives, farmers? organizations and rural development societies become all the more important. Rural incomes have to be generated and increased, but that requires investment in collective forms of production. For example in the fishing villages for net production, auction halls and seafood processing centres, and the reconstruction of small tanks with support for livestock raising, fresh water fisheries and downstream agriculture. There is a wealth of ideas and experience for rural income regeneration from the communities themselves, but first we need to prick the bubble of self-employment.???

Polonnaruwa Inferno ?58 ; 60 Years on...
	
hen a government, however popular, begins to help? racial or religious emotionalism merely because it is a harsh and loud-noised demand made on it, and then interferes? in the management and enforcement of law and order for the advantage of its favourites or to win the applause? of a crowd, however out of control it may be, disaster is certain.
? As rumors spread the town was buzzing with people. They collected? in groups? in streets, exchanging news about an invasion of Polonnaruwa by Tamils from Trincomalee and from Batticaloa.? Land development,? Irrigation department and Government farms labour gangs made up a regiment of Sinhalese battalion, and were on the rampage beating up Tamil labourers and officials, looting and raping.? Polonnaruwa had just a small police station. Requests for support were not regarded important as the Government seemed unwilling to take the situation in Polonnaruwa seriously. Sinhalese policemen who tried to defend Tamils were attacked by the mobs; a few had severe injuries which proved fatal. However, the colonists who settle down some years ago, under the auspicious of DS Senanayake in 1940s took no part in the rioting. It was mainly the imported labour and squatters who are new to the area.
?In 1958 April Ministry of Land and Land Development wanted to transfer 400 labour families of Tamils from Trincomalee displaced by the closing down of Royal Navy Dockyards to be settled in East Padaviya. Sinhala colonists from places like Veyangoda, Kosgoda, Gampaha and some older established? Sinhalese who regarded this province? as their traditional homeland opposed the idea of Settling Tamils in any part of? the Polonnaruwa District.
Tamil labourers in Polonnaruwa farms were attacked by Sinhalese gangs. The Tamils in the Polonnaruwa sugar-cane plantation ran away seeing the enemy approaching and hid in the jungles. The Sinhalese mobs set the sugar cane alight and scared away the remaining Tamils. As the Tamils came out screaming, they were cut down or pounded under heavy clubs. It was estimated that 60 people died in the night of May 25. ?
Meanwhile, race-hatred was being churned up elsewhere. Federal party men in Jaffna found a way to popularize their anti Sinhala sentiments by applying tar on Registration plates of vehicles where Sinhala ?SRI? was used in place of English letters, an unnecessary and provocative action by the government.
?The new order could have been brought about without? carnage and flaming communal resentment? by the firm application of? law without fear or favouritism? by statesmanship.
The? night train from Batticaloa was attacked, and three people killed which when later turned out there were only a few Tamils on the train. The Polonnaruwa station was attacked again on May 24, and nearly destroyed. On May 24, more than 500 hooligans? invaded the Polonnaruwa Railway Station and smashed windows of the Batticaloa train in search of Vavuniya-bound Federal party men.
?On Thursday night, passengers intimidated into getting off at Welikanda as news has reached them that? a gang of men were? on the way to prevent them from making the trip as they felt that passengers must be prevented from getting to Vavuniya? for the convention?a gang of men around 500 got on the train damaged equipment looking for Tamils.?? --OBSERVER-24/05/1958
Polonnaruwa had no Government agent, GA Anuradhapura, D. Aluvihare was overlooking the district? from his station with the assistance of a few administration officers. Community life was completely disorganized. The GA was shuttling between Polonnaruwa and his permanent station; he wanted to organize a refugee camp for Tamils in an isolated Irrigation Department bungalow with five policemen for the protection of refugees that flocked to occupy the place. The boutique owners under threat from the thugs refused to sell provisions for feeding the refugees. The Army took over the task successfully, but as the situation deteriorated, desperate measures were needed. The Army arrested a few ring leaders, rumormongers? and some officials who used their positions to stir up trouble. On May 24 and 25, fleeing Tamils, and Sinhalese suspected of giving sanctuary to Tamils were brutally attacked and killed in broad daylight. The goons burnt alive a man in Hingurakkgoda. The hoodlums roamed the streets in government vehicles creating mayhem; they destroyed anything that belonged to Tamils. The expected Emergency was not declared even on 26 morning; the situation in Polonnaruwa was beyond hope. The refugee camp was overcrowding; GA felt that it was no longer a safe sanctuary for refugees, he took steps to shift them to a location near the Kachcheri. The police intelligence reported that gangs from Minneriya, Hingurakkgoda and Padaviya are planning to gather more crowds for a major assault? in the night of? 26. They were targeting the Tamil refugee camp and the Police station where Sinhala refugee officials were camping. Their main aim was to attack the Sinhala officers who stood in the way of ?Sinhala brigade? and taking full control of Polonnaruwa.
?
	It was estimated that 60 people died in the night of May 25 
	
	
	Three died by Bren firing so the mob scattered in all directions. Thus averted a major catastrophe
	
	
	Mutual respect, goodwill existed between two major races for ages was destroyed in 1956
	
The GA and two of his officers were driving down the Parakrama tank bund looking for a place to set up a new refugee camp when they spotted signs of goons passed that way. Three bodies were lying on the road, they got off to see if there was any life left in the bodies. Aluvihare saw a? crowd approaching in a truck?as it came near one of them identified GA, and shouted, ?anna Ejantha Hamuduruwo, oka thamai Demalunta udaw karanne, marapiyaw? [there the GA who helps the Tamils, kill him!] the officers turned the jeep and fled the place to safety.
By afternoon tension increased. The crowds outside the police station had grown to over 3000. They were shouting obscenities at the officials until Army reinforcements arrived by evening, the platoon of? 25 men had brought a Bren gun with them. At about 3.30 pm the crowd armed with clubs and led by a hero advanced towards the station shouting obscenities and raised sarongs, and as they came nearer, the Commander of the Army unit wanted GA?s authority to open fire, which was readily granted in writing. The mob was a few yards away, when the Bren opened fire, three of the men fell dead. The crowd scattered in all directions. Thus averted a major catastrophe.
?Mutual respect and goodwill existed between two major races for over? a millennium was destroyed in 1956. The results of distrust surfaced in May/June 1958 communal riots. Man?s inhumanity to man in those hate-filled days overshadowed the social and economic change that immensely benefited the masses in 1956. The change people anticipated by popular mandate proved incapable of preventing? the process from worsening? into a nation-wide pandemonium. SWRD Bandaranaike?s new MEP government passed an Act making Sinhala the sole official language. This was done in spite of the fact that nearly 25% of the population used Tamil as their mother tongue. The move triggered dissatisfaction among the Tamils, who perceived their language and culture as being subject to an mounting threat.
PM Bandaranaike signed a pact with Tamil leader,? SJV Chelvanayagam in April 1957 making Tamil the administrative language in the Tamil-speaking north and east regions plus many other measures to counter the adverse effects of Sinhala only Bill. But he was forced to cancel the pact under pressure from the United National Party, which organized a paada yatra to Kandy and a rigorous island-wide campaign against it led by JR Jayawardene with the blessings of leader Dudley Senanayake. The? pressure from Buddhist monks and Sinhala nationalists who backed SLFP at 1956 election for abrogation of the pact was worse than the opposition?s? anti-pact campaign.? ?
It is the politicians of all factions who are responsible for creating disharmony among communities. There is no wisdom in putting blame on one community or the other. A race cannot be held accountable for the hostility of a few members who belonged to it. Neither there is any sense in finding who started it; how far back you want to go; a never concluding fruitless pastime.
Walter Fernando from Sirimal Uyana, Ratmalana responding to one of my articles wrote:
?My brother Leo Fernando and Annesley Mendis were the first to be killed in 1958 in Giritale. The killers were subsequently pardoned at the request of C. P. de Silva, Minister and MP for Polonnaruwa. The Sinhala Buddhist goons, aided by the government killed them. The two could not recite the gatha and that is why they were shot and mutilated.
Both were the first technical assistants of the irrigation department. A person named Gunasekara, engineer of the department was my brother?s boss. The men from the irrigation camp were given permission to take whatever and do whatever necessary to protect the Sinhala nation. This was the end result.
The others were Ariyadasa, Walatara, the names I remember. There were six technical assistants. Incidentally engineer Gunasekara was the one who initially trained? them at Kalutara. I was also present at the irrigation inquiry where I met Walatara, Ariyadasa and a few others who embraced me and cried and said they were helpless.?
When I sought Fernando?s? permission to quote him, he says?,? ?Every word of what I have written is true and correct. You have my permission to quote me.?

Set up separate court to hear cases involving Buddhist Monks: Champika
	
A separate court, in consultation with the Mahanayake Theras of the relevant chapters, should be set up to hear court cases involving Buddhist monks, Jathika Hela Urumaya General Secretary Champika Ranawaka said.
He said this in response to a journalist at a news conference held today.
Mr. Ranawaka said the opinion of the Mahanayaka Theras should be sought with regard to cases involving Bhikkhus and that the Constitution had provisions to establish a separate court and as such it would be best to set up separate courts to hear court cases involving Buddhist monks.
?Buddhist monks have never asked for special privileges because the Buddha himself had said monks are subjected to the State law. However, the other cases too should be accelerated,? he said.
Mr. Ranawaka said the lawsuit on the D.A. Rajapaksa Memorial and Museum was postponed several times and the Avant-Garde case yet to be heard.
He said though the Court had sentenced Bodu Bala Sena (BBS) General Secretary the Ven. Galagodaatte Gnanasara Thera, it had failed to punish the criminals involved in Avant-Garde. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

Singapore?s Hub success and  Sri Lanka?s choices
	
Trump ? Kim summit became the story for the global media last week, the multitude of narratives were presented in both legacy and social media platforms from a plethora of agents representing traditional security scholars, media personalities to millions of interested global citizens. From a Sri Lankan perspective the geo strategic and security implications of the joint agreement stemming from the Singapore summit is an analysis in progress.
Singapore and Sri Lanka are eternally tied since Lee Kwan Yew made it a point to declare that he was inspired by Sri Lanka in making certain crucial decisions regarding the shape and architecture of the modern Singaporean state. Today parallels are few and Singapore?s current global and regional position should be taken as inspiration for Sri Lanka to study, learn and possibly adapt certain forms to emulate.
Making of the Hub
Sri Lanka?s current and future aspirations to gain the best out of the regional, global transformations and strategic great power rivalry has been stressed by local and global analysts it has been the crux of many pieces on this column. Yet our Strategic, Economic and Security aspirations to being a hub may need some serious insights from how Singapore is achieving in becoming a multi nodal hub in Asia. Singapore?s nodes represent fields of education, trade, arbitration, health, security forums, strategic dialogues and its newest addition as the safest venue for top level diplomatic engagements.
Asian analysts during the height of the Cold War when Singapore separated from Malaysia under hostile conditions in 1965 would have never envisaged or projected its rise fifty years down the line. Singapore?s political system and foreign policy has attracted significant studies in the recent past and Singapore?s pragmatic realism when dealing with larger powers regionally and globally where the wisdom of its first Foreign Minister S. Rajaratnam?s? foreign policy philosophy of, ?words coinciding with deeds? have been an enduring fundamental is how Singapore relates with the rest of the world.
Singapore has managed to be resilient and perceiving its foreign policy while consistently negating hostilities has managed to be enemy to none. It is part of the Chinese One Belt One Road Initiative (OBOR), it continue strong trade and defense corporation with United States, Singapore wants to play a lead role in transforming ASEAN and it seeks to expand and deepen relations with The United Kingdom, Japan, Australia and the European Union as recently outlined by Singaporean Foreign Affairs Minister Vivian Balakrishnan symbolizing Singapore?s multi engagement foreign policy. Such a foreign policy should be a case study for Sri Lanka?s foreign policy makers of how country manages strategic competition and manages to be a genuinely connected small power.
Security Hub
Singapore has managed to reap the benefits of a ?Great convergence?, a concept celebrated and respected Singaporean diplomat and academic Kishore Mahbubani mooted in a book in 2013, that traced the return of Asian primacy in global politics. Every defense white paper that has come out in the last decade from the United State, China, Japan and Australia share this idea of the interdependence of the West and Asia in their respective analysis.
These white papers do agree on another factor, that given the complexity of the new global challenges, the primary efforts by all these countries are to evolve dynamic security strategies of resilience. Each white paper highlights the importance of the Asia pacific region as a Strategic sphere where most of the emerging regional and extra regional competition will intensify.
Singapore has been a key arms importer in the world few years ago it was among the top five arm importers in the world. In 2017 the largest arms importer Saudi Arabia accounted for 12% arms transfers from the United States while Singapore was nearly 5%. Singaporean Air Force is made out of primarily US platforms has developed a special relationship with the United States Air force. Singapore is anticipated to soon procure the F 35 fighter jet, which is the most advanced and controversial weapons platform in the USAF Air Assets.
Thus given the scale and size of the Singaporean economy, arms platforms and military modernization remains a high priority. Singapore maintain a Strategic framework Agreement on defence and security cooperation with the United States since 2005 and for the last quarter century has provided military facilities to the US Armed forces. Yet such massive security commitments has not deterred Singapore undertaking bold and innovative diplomatic stances.
?
	Singapore, the chair of ASEAN may have aided to set up the Trump-Kim summit
	
	
	Shangri la dialogue maintains an unblemished record of the highest level security forum
	
Diplomatic Hub
How has it managed to transform from a mere trading hub to become an Asian Fulcrum? The answer lies in its ability to devise a unique capability to manage both mini lateral and multi-lateral partnerships. In 2015 it managed to provide space to facilitate a historic meeting between Chinese President Xi Jinping and Taiwani President Ma Ying-jeou, in 2015.
What does the 20 million dollar bill that the Singaporean government footed to host the Trump and Kim summit represent. In pure monetary terms it is a significant cost. Yet looking at the overall strategic interests of Singapore the cost is well worth. Singapore since the dawn of the 21st Century has managed to position itself uniquely as the best venue for track one connections.Its success is mostly based on the burgeoning of the Asia?s most significant inter-governmental security forum coordinated through efforts of the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) commonly known as the Shangri la dialogue. Though Singapore has strategically envisaged the prospect of external aggression, it has always maintained an offensive posture sufficient to project capabilities that convinces a potential aggressor of unprecedented circumstances if provoked. Yet has managed to be diplomatically extremely amiable. ?
It has cleverly balanced and even made to its advantage the relations with United States and China. While providing the assurance to global leaders irrespective of what part of the world and what sort of political model they represent they are safe when they are in Singapore.
Analysts argue Singapore?s current position as the chair of the ASEAN may have aided in the process that set up the Singapore summit for Presidents Trump and Kim. An underreported and analysed factor when it comes to Singapore is that it is a national security state par excellence, with zero terror activity reported in the last decade and the government maintain a zero tolerance towards any form of militant or terror activity.
Shangri la dialogue maintains an unblemished record of the highest level security forum that has been ongoing for 17 years without even a security scare, this reputation has enabled Singapore today to be a venue for unique diplomatic sanctuary. Trump and Kim meeting was the unprecedented high point, Singapore now can boast if they facilitated leaders of two countries who were literally threatening to destroy each other what more that they cannot do.
Insights for Sri Lanka
Sri Lanka?s political leadership in the past and present governments have highlighted the aspirations to make Sri Lanka the key hub in the Indian Ocean. Sri Lanka is well positioned to be a small power with larger than life significance when it comes to benefiting from intense big power rivalry. Singapore has demonstrated the importance of not undermining one aspiration to gain another. It has maintained its drive to continuously upgrade its security capabilities while advancing its diplomatic leverage by creating a smart, intelligent extremely forward looking diplomatic and Foreign Service.
The immediate challenge Sri Lanka faces is neither the security nor diplomatic problem but the developmental challenge. The simple answer is that if Sri Lanka can create a space for regional interactions, from diplomatic, security to trade the long term benefits are limitless.
The biggest obstacle to the hub is our political crises that is stalling progress in all fronts, Sri Lanka like Singapore has to maintain a posture of internal security, and social cohesion, we may not be interested in the so called enlightened dictatorship model of governance in Singapore to replace our ailing political systems yet, if we miss these opportunities within the next five to ten years, our dreams of becoming a genuine hub will be lost and countries like Singapore may pull far ahead and Sri Lanka will be eternally crippled and broken. ?

Addressing United Nations Security Council Open Arria Formula meeting in New York under the theme of 'Maritime Crime as a Threat to International Peace and Security', Minister Ratnayaka said the Lankan Government was delighted with the decision of the Global Maritime Crime Programme of UNODC to relocate the Head of the Programme and his expert team to Sri Lanka, to run global programming across the Indian Ocean, Atlantic Ocean, Pacific Ocean, Mediterranean and Caribbean from offices in Colombo.
"The 'Colombo Declaration' and the Southern Route Partnership were identified as the primary mechanisms to counter narcotics trafficking in the Indian Ocean, at the Ministerial Meeting of the Indian Ocean Commission (IOC) in April 2018. Sri Lanka remains committed to the ?Colombo Declaration? and will continue to provide political and regional support in international fora, as I am doing today" Ratnayaka said, addressing the high-profile UN meeting.
He said the Sri Lanka Police Narcotics Bureau with the support of Sri Lanka Customs seized over 1, 700kg of Cocaine in major seizures in 2016 and 2017.
"This included a seizure of 928kg of Cocaine from an Indian bound merchant vessel, MV Fabiola when it docked at the Colombo Port on 9 December 2016. This haul is the largest Cocaine seizure recorded in South Asia with an estimated street value of Sri Lankan Rupees 12 billion, around USD 77 million. In April 2016, the Police Narcotics Bureau and Sri Lanka Navy in a Joint Maritime Operation seized 101kg of Heroin on a dhow off the Southern coast of Sri Lanka," he explained.
"There have been reports that drug dhows have travelled eastwards towards Sri Lanka and the Maldives, as recently as February 2018, and due to legal and jurisdictional inhibitions, sharing of such information with affected States was constrained. Just two weeks ago, on 31 May 2018, a dhow ran aground off Innafinolhu Island in the northern part of the Maldivian archipelago, laden with 115kgs of drugs," the Minister also added.
"We are experiencing a massive explosion of drug trafficking by maritime routes. The use of the Indian Ocean as a major drug trafficking highway ? particularly for Heroin originating in Afghanistan ? poses a maritime security and a maritime law enforcement challenge," he said adding that one of the major challenges was the lack of a ?legal finish? (such as prosecution) for the majority of drug seizures made within international waters in the Indian Ocean region. (TK)

Snake bites
	
No longer a Neglected ?Disease? of the Poor in Sri Lanka
Sri Lanka, centuries back called as the ?Eastern entrep?t of grains? still owns acres of lush green paddy fields-harvesting piles of rice with the blood and tears of native farmers, who work hard in order to keep up with the demand of the nation.
There is no doubt about the fact that, these individuals do not get the due gratitude for the service they render, but keeping that aside do they even receive the privileges, they are bestowed with? More importantly, do farmers, especially in those rural areas receive the basic health education and care, they deserve?
Well, our discussion today is neither on farmers nor grains, but ?Snake bites-once known as the ?Neglected ?disease of poverty?-one of the paramount health issues faced by the community mingling with cultivating and harvesting to satiate our hunger.
Decades back, this problem was only restricted to farmer families in peripheral areas like Anuradhapura, Polonnaruwa, Puttalam or Kurunegala. But following humans encroaching natural habitats of the snakes, they have started invading ours, to suburbs to cities, taking us towards life-threatening circumstances and even death.
Professor Kolitha Sellahewa, MBBS, MD, FCCP, FRACP (Hon.), Professor of? Medicine and Head of Department, is undoubtedly the best person to talk on this crucial keynote, heading the Chair of the Snake-bite Expert Committee of the Sri Lanka Medical Association, having initiated a number of projects to decipher the enigma of snake bites and saved thousands of lives with his years of experience, comprehensive knowledge and inquisitive approach to research studies.
According to Professor Sellahewa, there are 96 species of snake, identified so far, out of which, only six are deadly venomous.
A few decades ago, most of these snakes were only found in rural areas but due to urbanization and several other factors, a considerable snake population is noted elsewhere, even in highly urbanized areas like Colombo and Kandy.
?This discipline of medicine addressing snake bites and its treatment didn?t have a clear-cut edge with documented data, records or statistics in Sri Lanka until 1980, after which the Snakebite Expert Committee of SLMA was established and its members initiated several research studies and awareness programmes for both healthcare professionals and general public, making a significant positive impact on the community in dealing with snake bite victims? he added.
Venomous snakes in Sri Lanka
?
Cobra
	Common Krait
	Celyon Krait
	Saw-scaled viper
	Russel?s Viper
	Hump nosed (the commonest) Viper
How does a snake bite cost a life?
According to the professor, venomous snakes are distinguished from non-venomous ones, by the presence of a pair of cephalic glands, which produce venom and enlarged Maxillary Teeth commonly known as Fangs.
Snake venom contains powerful tissue destroying toxins, which are mostly directed against nerve and vascular tissue, resulting in impaired clotting, neurological disturbances and local inflammation.
These effects will vary according to the species of the snake and if immediate treatment is not provided, even the potentially reversible outcomes could get worsened and deteriorate the patient, until his life is taken away.
Prevention is always better than cure-does it apply to snake bites too?
When it comes to snake bites, it would rather be ?avoidance? than prevention.
Being an occupational hazard, most of the time and an accident at other times, snake bites are not easy to be avoided yet, proper attention and awareness would definitely limit the vulnerability.
Awareness- Know those local snakes which are commonly seen in your area
	Know what times of the year, what times of day or night and what kinds of weather they are most likely to be active.
	Be cautious about snakes, especially after rains, floods and at harvesting times.
	Be vigilant about handlings snakes, which are thought to be deadly
	Wear proper shoes or boots with long trousers, especially, when walking in the dark or in the undergrowth.
	Use a torch when walking at night.
	Stamping the feet and tapping with a stick serves to scare away snakes from the pathway when walking owing to their sensitivity to vibration.
	Avoid snakes as much as possible -never handle, threaten or attack a snake.
	Avoid sleeping on the ground.
	Avoid entertaining snake charmers.
Rush the patient to the hospital as every second counts
Some people have this off-target impression that they need to bring the, snake-alive or killed, to the hospital following the bite, for medical treatment to be started.
?There is no truth in that at all. In fact, it would be easier for us, health care professionals, if the snake is brought to the hospital to identify and start treatment accordingly. But even if the snake is not there to be seen, we still can determine the species by considering factors like the time of the day, envenomation location on the body, circumstance of the bite (walking in a paddy field, sleeping in the watch-hut), site of the bite, and the clinical symptoms of the patient,? Professor Sellahewa said.
Some fast-rolling facts to keep in mind
Time period
Krait- 6 p.m.-6 a.m., May to November
Circumstance
Cobra-water bodies, inside the house.
Krait- sleeping on the floor at night, wattle and daub huts
Russell?s Viper-Paddy fields, footpaths
Site of the bite
Hump-nosed Viper and Saw Scaled Viper- Fingers, hands, foot, leg below knee
Russell?s Viper and Cobra-Arms and legs up to knees and elbow.
Krait ? Any site from head to toe.
Clinical features
Coagulopathy (Impaired blood clotting)Russell?s Viper
	Neurotoxic signs (Effects on the nervous system)-Krait, Russel?s Viper, Cobra
	Respiratory muscle paralysis- Krait-Cobra
	Local swelling and blister formation-Cobra, Russell?s viper and hump-nosed viper.
DOs and DON?Ts following a snake bite
DON?Ts
Do not wait until signs and symptoms appear to seek medical care.
	Do not let the patient to panic and run around as increased blood circulation can aggravate the spread of venom throughout the body.
	Do not cut or suck the bite site
	Do not give any medication, fruit drinks or alcohol without medical advice
	Do not put tourniquets or tie up above the bite wound as this can cut down the blood supply resulting in further tissue damage.
	Do not apply cold compresses or ice on the bite site.
DO?s
Calm the patient and reassure
	Wash the bite area gently with clean water.
	If the victim seems to be breathless, try mouth to mouth breathing until taken to the hospital. Particularly important after krait bite.
	Remove rings, bracelets, watches as anticipated swelling will make it harder to remove these later
	Take the patient to the nearest Government Hospital ASAP because almost all the hospitals in Sri Lanka at present are equipped to treat snake bites
Anti-Venom therapy-the savior
Anti-venom, the only antidote for snake venom is currently available for systemic envenomation by Cobra, Common Krait, Russell?s Viper and Saw Scaled Viper.
This polyvalent anti-snake venom, raised from horses, is currently imported to Sri Lanka from India and has limitations in its efficacy and safety? due to the fact that they are manufactured against toxins created by the venomous snakes in India, which might not be 100% compatible with those created by venomous species found in Sri Lanka.
?Adverse reactions to imported anti-venoms have always been a problem and making matters worse, Hump Nosed Viper being the culprit of most of the snake bite cases in our country is not covered by this anti-venom, ? Professor Sellahewa said. According to the professor, bite victims are usually managed with symptomatic and supportive care in the hospitals. ?This issue has been there for a long time and that was why we thought of taking measures to manufacture our own anti-venom utilizing venom from Sri Lankan snakes, which would cover all these species of deadly venomous snakes, found in Sri Lanka.
Finally a green light to decipher the enigma
Turning a new page on anti-venom treatment, a remarkable initiative has been taken by the Snake Bite Expert Committee of Sri Lanka Medical Association in close collaboration with the Instituto Clodomiro Picado (ICP) in Costa Rica, Antivenom research international California (AVRI)USA and University of Peradeniya.
?The need for more efficacious and safer species-specific anti-venom, including the Hump-nosed Viper was eluded to by me as far back as 1996. However administrative barriers, bureaucratic apathy and red tape hampered our progress. ?Having overcome the barriers and relentless commitment to providing an urgent need for the poor and destitute in this country we can, at last, see the light at the end of a tunnel, we traversed for 20 long years,? Prof Sellahewa said. ?A test batch of new polyspecific antivenom for the highly venomous snakes including the Hump-nosed Viper has been manufactured at ICP, Costa Rica. And the anticipated successful completion of the ongoing clinical trials at Peradeniya is expected to make it available on a commercial scale in the not too distant future,? he said.
Additionally, with further developments from these initial stages we will not only to? be able to cater to the therapeutic needs of Sri Lankan snake-bite victims but also enkindle a boost in respective authorities, to contrive on manufacturing our own anti-venom within the country itself, using local expertise and transfer of state-of-the-art facilities with the potential of? exporting antivenom to other countries and thereby contributing? to employment generation and a? remarkable growth in the economy of our country,? Professor Sellahewa said.

Undecided: in search of contentment
	
Malaka Dewapriya presents with rare ingenuity and acumen insights into the lives of today?s youth
?
The Sri Lankan political and socio-economic environment has undergone change from time to time. We do not need fancy data analysis to identify such change we experienced ourselves in the 60s.
We have not forgotten the socio-economic trends of that era brought about by political transitions. Those of us who have passed the 55th milepost in life may probably remember the political environment and the associated social and economic setting under the rule of seven-party coalition government of 65 ? 70.
The simple life style of 70-77 era and the hardships we endured? during the period are not easy to forget. Subsequently, we experienced the social transitions that emerged with the introduction of the ?open economic policy? in 1977 and the social trends consistent with political changes during 88-93, 94-2001, 2002-2004, 2005-2014 periods.
The expectations of life and the behavioural patterns of the Sri Lankan youth changed in a subtle manner in accordance with and in relation tothe social transformations that occurred following change of governments.
In evaluating The Undecided, maiden cinematic creation of Malaka Dewapriya, we must call to our minds some of the notable films centred on the youth of the era described above.
It will help, I believe, to properly identify and compare the life styles, behavioural patterns and relationships and the expectations of the youth who underwent change due to social metastasis with the current social patterns portrayed through interactions of Sasitha, the undecided youth in Malaka?s film.
To begin with, let us focus our attention on Ahas Gawwa (One league of sky), momentous cinematic creation of renowned Sri Lankan film maker, Dharmasena Pathiraja. In my opinion, Ahas Gawwa accurately and realistically depicted the life of urban youth in early 70s.
Joblessness (unemployment) was rampant and it was the lower-middle-class urban youth, who were greatly affected.
Even a casual job just to eke out a living was hard to find. Youths didn?t dream of owning a car or building a house of their own. Nor did they fantasize about sipping a bourbon in a plush hotel.
Walmathwuwo, the cinematic creation of Wasantha Obeysekara screened in 1976, brings to light the life of village youth in the 60s and 70s.
?The expectations of love fizzle out. As the aristocrat craftily plans to acquire his merge properties youth, in desperation decides to terminate the tyrant. (Even though it is not shown in the film, it was this type of youth who joined the 1971 uprising).
Pathraja?s film Para dig (On the run), first screened in 1980, outlined the ethos of the urban youth of
the period.
?
"The youth, who leads a dubious, arrogant and rather parasitic life, is more dangerous than the youth who aspires to spend a steady life even outside the country"
The newly introduced free economy policy has presented them with opportunities to ?earn a fast buck? by hook or crook to keep them going.
The protagonist of the film is a youth from a village who comes to the city in search of his destiny. He lands a job as a ?vehicle seizer?, a person entrusted to grab forcibly from vehicle owners who default paying monthly lease instalments.
Free economy has not only changed the economy but also the city life which transformed drastically. It is normally enjoyed by the upper classwho have the economic punch. Glamorous city life attracts the uprooted protagonist who uses the hard earned money to for a taste of it. He sums it up in a single sentence:
?We are like thrown away twigs; they may sprout but there are no roots?.
As far as I know, however, after the year 2,000, there are no noteworthy films that portrayed the life of the youth so authentically.
Malaka Dewapriya?s The Undecided fills that void, I conclude. One may wonder why I took a long and arduous route to arrive at the conclusion. In my opinion, the analysis provides an appropriate backdrop for the better understanding of the protagonist in Malaka?s Undecided.
I must begin by stating that the film The Undecided, doesn?t just strive only to portray the life of unemployed urban youth. It goes far beyond that.
It offers a complete picture of the cross-section of the contemporary society.
It is brought to us through the interactions of Sasitha the youth with the other characters of the film.
The picture thus presented is realistic. In it is depicted the upshot of socio-economic and political evolution that took place during last few decades.
The film demands us to subtly sift through the complexities of the social network that was born out of interpersonal connections brought about by the internet and other developments in the communication sphere in the decade closet.
Sasitha, the protagonist in the film represents the majority who, for different reasons, fail to complete successfully the formal education.
Like the majority of them, however, he shows dexterity in manipulating mobile phones, smart phones and other modern-day personal communication devices. He has mastered the use of computers for purposes he likes best. Deftly utilizing the devices and the technology, he manages to establish relationships with many. Facebook and Skype is his mainstay in this endeavour.
Society too, especially in the last decade or so has been engulfed and entangled in the World Wide Web.
Sasitha is not leading a comparatively simple life style similar to that of the youth in Ahas Gawwaor Walmathwuwo.
In a way, it is an extension of the character of young man in Para dige. Sasitha is relentless, adamantly and unceasingly run after the electronic contrivances needed for his id?e fixe.
For his dreams, Sasitha needs money ? shedloads. He dresses well and although not addicted, smoking pot comes naturally to him. It is the Sri Lankan women in middle-east he easily befriends via Facebook and frequently chats with using Skype. It is not necessary here to discuss in detail, why these women go to Middle East. However, it must be said that, in contrast to early migratory workers, the new breed is quite conversant with modern communication technologies and use of Facebook, Skype to establish relationships and communicate in order to find some relief from the dissatisfactions and frustrations originating as a result of socio-economic milieu.
?
"The social atmosphere and perhaps, the psychological ambience that prevailed during and after the war between the two ethnically divided groups served to foster and boost Sinhala chauvinism, Buddhist extremism or fanaticism and localism"
?
In the present day Sri Lankan society, it is not only the customary or typical company owner who exploits youth labour. The new communication technologies that are associated with and that accompanied open economy paved way for a multitude of small-scale enterprises like communication centres, record bars, distribution services, computer and internet cafes, printing shops, all over the country.
It so happened that some of these entrepreneurs were ex-members of traditional Leftist Parties. Few were those who lost employment en masse following the July 1980 general strike. They knew well what exploitation was, being at the receiving end.
Now, after becoming proprietors themselves, they use new enticements like motorcycles, mobile phones and even internet facilities to?good advantage.
They use endearing language to deceitfully afford feelings of camaraderie. Thus the exploitation continues. It is a ?preach and leech? approach with a subtle and discreet threat of violence sometimes.
Sasitha?s friend in Undecided is such a character.
Sasitha?s sister in the film represents a set of oppressed women struggling hard to make a living and often without hope of marriage or a reassuring future.
Generally, they are the ?by-products? of the garment industry and in most cases, forced into ?self- employment.?
These characters, both in the film and in society at large, almost always interact strongly with each other with varying consequences in their pursuit of aspirations and expectations and may be, perhaps their brand of happiness. Reciprocity is so complex, so intense one finds it difficult to analyze and comprehend on his or her own.
But the young film maker Malaka Dewapriya, in his very first attempt, has, I believe, presented us with rare ingenuity and acumen clear insights into the lives of present-day youth.

## Title: Whither the Kim-Trump summit

Whither the Kim-Trump summit
	
On June 12, as the world held its collective breath, so-to-say, as US President Donald Trump, leader of the world?s foremost military power, met with his adversary - President Kim Jong-un of North Korea - a protege of China, the world?s leading economic power.? ?
The bone of contention - North Korea?s nuclear weapons as well as its missiles programme.? ?
In the aftermath of Trump?s ascendance as President of the US, the war of words, threats and counterthreats to the use of nuclear weapons as a means of settling the dispute which broke out between the US president and his counter-part in North Korea, alarmed people worldwide and led to calls for tempering down of the rhetoric to ensure the vile threats did not lead to an accidental outbreak of nuclear war.? ?
Even prior to his inauguration Trump had taken an extremely belligerent stance towards the North Korean regime as well as against China.? ?
While tensions continued to rise, of a sudden on Apr 30, 2018 - Trump floated the idea of meeting Kim on the border of Koreas. Then, equally suddenly on May 24, Trump called off summit citing various reasons and then again on Jun 1, 2018, Trump announced that the summit with Kim Jong Un was back on track, a week after he called it off. So it was President Trump finally met at a ?summit meeting? with President Kim Jong-un of North Korea. The on-again, off-again meeting finally taking place on June 12 in Singapore.? ?
The hurriedly planned event which began at approximately 9.00 am, included a bilateral private meeting between the two leaders sans advisors - only included their translators - and was followed by an expanded bilateral meeting. The summit itself had no clear or specifically enunciated goals.? ?
While US Secretary of State Pompeo described US objectives as the immediate ?permanent, verifiable, irreversible dismantling of North Korea?s weapons of mass destruction programme, North Korea?s state media said the pair would discuss a ?permanent and durable peace-keeping mechanism? on the Korean peninsula, denuclearisation of the peninsula and other issues of mutual concern!? ?
Not surprisingly the joint declaration issued by the two sides after the summit did not commit North Korea to the complete, irreversible and verifiable dismantling of Pyongyang?s nuclear arsenal. Rather, it included a comment that North Korea would ?work toward the complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula? and for follow-up talks.? ?
Since North Korea had already committed itself to halt testing of nuclear weapons, at a summit between the North and South Korea earlier, the joint declaration had little serious content. So what exactly changes after the summit between the ?most powerful man in the world? -Trump and the North Korean leader?
As we mentioned in these columns earlier, the US move to focus on Asia is to counteract China?s growing economic might and military stature, which is being seen as a threat to US interests in the region. The Trump-Kim summit needs to be understood in the light of how the US views China. Its (China?s) rise to the position of world?s leading economic power and its ambition in the region and beyond. It would appear the US summit meeting with North Korea is an attempt to leverage on this new-found friendship a means of outflanking China in its own backyard. It is also a means of building new alliances with countries in the South China Sea region who have issues with China?s growing ambitions.? ?
In the recent past we have witnessed US allies making efforts to convince countries in the South Asia region to beware of possible ?Chinese debt traps? which could turn these countries - including Sri Lanka- into pawns in a game of ?Chinese Chequers?.? ?
Through its meddling in West Asia (Middle East), the US and its western allies have brought ruin, death, suffering and destruction to the people in that region of the Asian continent.
The Kim-Trump Summit looks more like a preparation of the ground, to create similar situations of destabilization and unrest as are prevalent in the Middle East in South and East Asia.? ?
It appears to be, not only an effort to not contain China, but to regain US dominance in the Asia region.??
