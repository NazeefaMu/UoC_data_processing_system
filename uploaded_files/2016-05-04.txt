A blessing in disguise?
	
?
Speculation is rife in legal circles these days that a leading legal personality is going to quit office shortly.?
?
The man is unhappy that he was overlooked when selecting a person as the head of the department despite his being the senior-most official. ?They say that the main reason why he was not selected for the high post was his findings of an investigation conducted ?into an affair of a certain firm which were considered flawed.?
An international organization, they say, has offered our disillusioned man a lucrative job and he is going to take it up, they say.?

A traitor unmasked?
	
?
The joint opposition group is said to have unmasked a ?traitor? in their ranks recently. This ?traitor?, a Diyawanna member hailing from the South has earned a name as an ambitious guy always on the lookout for short cuts to attain high political office. And he is expected to do a pole vault into yahapalanaya taking a cue from the young one from Galle -- the latest defector from the JO camp.?
?
What has really angered the JO group is an underhand bid made by this ambitious one to conduct the May Day rally according to a pre-conceived plan of his.?
The former strongman who had been closely watching the antics of the ambitious one from the South had sent for him the other day. When the guy showed up, the former strongman had told him: ?If you are planning to join the government tell us before you go.?
This unexpected remark had stunned the guy from the South who had replied: ?Believe me, Sir, I am not leaving.? The man had not fully recovered from the shock even at the time he said adieu to his former boss,?they say.

Abusing official status to get oil free of charge
	
?
The two main political parties in Yahapalanaya held two separate rallies to celebrate May Day last Sunday.?
?
The leadership of both parties issued specific instructions to the organizers of their May Day celebrations well in advance not to misuse any of the state-owned resources in connection with the event. The Head and the Second in command of yahapalanaya won kudos from the civil society activists in particular for this decision. ??
However, a purohita hailing from the South and carrying the ?fuel power? had reportedly given a ?fiat? to his party that ran counter to the spirit of the instructions issued by the yahapalanaya bosses. ?Ask the drivers of the buses transporting our supporters to the rally to call at the filling stations, a list of which I am giving you. The authorities operating these filling stations have agreed to pump oil into our buses free of charge!?
A close henchman of the purohita a bit surprised at this arrangement had asked: ?Sir, are you going to foot the oil bills later??
The purohita who carefully looked around to ascertain that there were no nosy reporters within hearing distance, had replied: ?Why on earth should we pay?? ?Oil prices came down sharply in the world market recently and we didn?t ask this company to lower the prices in keeping with the price drops in the world market. And they have been making huge profits as a result. Therefore, I ask them to supply us oil for our May Day transport vehicles free of charge. I am confiding in you a top secret?!? ?

Amarapura prelates requests MS to maintain MR?s military security
	
Amarapura Chapter Mahanayake the Most Ven. Dawuldena Gnanissara Thera has written to President Maitripala Sirisena requesting him to continue with the military security provided to former president Mahinda Rajapaksa considering the fact that he gave leadership to the erradication of terrorism from the country.
The English translation of the full letter sent by the Chief Prelate follows:
?Attanam Upaman Kathwa- Na Haneyya Na Gathaye?
Taking one?s self as an example others should not be killed, nor encouraged to be killed
We would like to state that the objective of the Maha Sangha during your leadership which seems to be committed towards policies of governance based on ?Artha? and ?Dhamma,? is to give connected advice and not to promote or condemn individual personalities. Politics is for the laity. I am of the firm stand that interfering in it is not for the clergy.
While taking up that stand I would like to give a piece of advice that is not political but personal. While the word of the Buddha is that who abides by the Dhamma is protected by the Dhamma, anyone interfering with and punishing those who do not abide by the Dhamma is also a sin committed by that person.
The terrorists have a grudge against the first citizen of the country, whoever it is, that finished a 30-year-old savage war waged by a group of terrorists in a manner seen nowhere in the world using modern weapons and military power, airplanes, ships, armored tanks, submarines and suicide bombers. It is accepted by most people that although terrorism was eliminated from our motherland, they are active and powerful in many parts of the world. Everyone knows that there is no other country in the world that faced such a powerful terror group in recent history.
Therefore I advice you with compassion to shelve the decision not to provide military security to a defeated leader, and maintain the military security provided to the former president by respecting the wishes of a larger percentage of the people. My personnel belief is that it would only add to your good reputation and would not harm it in any manner.

An intruder delivers  the funeral oration
	
The nation bade farewell to the doyen of Sinhala cinema who passed away recently at a funeral held with state honours.The organizing committee on an unanimous decision had invited a highly respected personality to deliver the funeral oration, but when the time came for it, an uninvited character who appeared from nowhere began addressing the gathering.?
?
He first started showering praise on the VIPs present and soon afterwards turned his guns on the high-ups of the film corporation. He charged that the running of the corporation had been left in the hands of inept and incompetent individuals who had later ruined it. It was quite obvious that this intruder wanted to impress the Big Boss and the VIPs present that there was none more suited to run the corporation than himself.?
A cinematographer, a close associate of the departed film director present at the event, reacting angrily to the intruder?s critical remarks had told another veteran film maker seated by his side: ?The Corporation was going through its worst times, when this fellow was enjoying the best of times as a consultant to the Queen at the palace. It was the time when Anojas and Rukanthas were harassed. I?ll tell the fellow a thing or two when I meet him!??

The importing of vehicles to the country will be suspended for six months due to the present currency fluctuation, Vehicle Importers? Association of Sri Lanka (VIASL) President Indika Sampath Merenchige today said.
?The cost of used and brand new vehicles that are imported from Japan had gone up drastically due to the deprecation of the SL Rupee against the Japanese Yen,? Mr. Merenchige said.
?But if anyone still wants to import vehicles they may do so, although they will be called upon to bear the increased cost, which could be an increase of Rs.300,000 to Rs.400,000, due to the currency fluctuations,? he said.
?Following a meeting between local vehicle importers today a decision was taken to stop the import? of vehicles for three to six months until the foreign exchange rates stabilize,? he said.
The vehicles that had already been imported would be sold at the currant market value so as not to cause any inconvenience to the government, he added.
However the increased fifteen percent VAT policy would not affect imported vehicles, he said. ?
Meanwhile, speaking to Daily Mirror, chairman of the Vehicle Importers? Association Mahinda Sarathchandra explained that the decision to put a temporary halt to vehicle imports was taken due to the foreign currency rate increase, mainly In relation to the Japanese Yen, US Dollar, Sterling Pound and the Euro.
?About 15,300 motor cars were imported into the country during the past 4 months which is a slight drop in comparison to 2015 which saw 150,628 cars being imported,? he said. (Chaturanga Pradeep)

This is a story that has gone viral even in the public domain. The head of the biggest financial institution here bought an outfit worth about Rs.2 million made in the country of Uncle Sam and referred the bill to the Accounts department of his institution for settlement.

Discreet inquiries made by inquisitive ones had later brought to light that this bigwig had sent even a domestic bill running into several millions of rupees to the institution?s Accounts department for payment. He had railed at the officials concerned when they had pointed out it was irregular for them to meet his household expenses.?
The officials of this institution who looked up documentation relating to the perks that institutional head could claim as an official right had found that he is entitled to a # 200 Winter Clothing Allowance once in three years. The officials of the institution accountable for making payments fear that they might receive summons from the FCID sooner or later for settling illegal bills referred to them by the head of the institution.
Some executives of this institution have already resigned saying it was impossible for them to discharge their official functions without fear or favour under a head who had no respect for the law or the rules and regulations. The latest to quit this institution in disgust is an elder sister of a leading purohita who was at the vanguard of the people?s movement that brought yahapalanaya to power.?

Sri Lanka?s fastest growing commercial bank, Pan Asia Banking Corporation PLC (PABC) relaunched its unique value-added fixed deposit product ?Suwasavi?, which comes with a free medical cover and a host of other benefits. ?
Under Suwasavi, the bank will offer a free medical cover up to 15 percent of the value of the fixed deposit which enables the deposit holder to reimburse the medical cost. ??
This value addition is offered in addition to the attractive interest rate offered on the Suwasavi fixed deposit. Hence, Suwasavi enables the account holder to meet unforeseen medical expenses while enjoying a high interest on his/her fixed deposit.?
This value-added benefit is designed to offer much sought-after relief to customers who need protection against ever rising cost of hospitalization which otherwise may jeopardize one?s future financial plans.
Suwasavi fixed deposits are offered for a period of one year with a minimum investment of Rs.100,000 and the customers have the option to receive interest monthly or at maturity.
Below are the excerpts from an interview with Pan Asia Bank DGM Marketing and Card Products Nalaka Wijayawardana about this unique fixed deposit product.?
?
What is Suwasavi fixed deposit?
The Suwasavi fixed deposit is a value-added one-year fixed deposit product from Pan Asia Bank and the uniqueness of this product is that in addition to the interest on the fixed deposit, it also provides a free medical insurance coverage to the deposit holder and his/her family.?
?
How does it work?
When customers invest in a Suwasavi fixed deposit, they will automatically receive a free family medical insurance cover of up to 15 percent of the deposit value per annum. Also this cover will be valid for a period of one year, which is the tenure of the deposit. For example, if a customer who is less than 65 years of age places a Suwasavi fixed deposit of Rs.1,000,000, the customer and his/her family will be covered by a free medical insurance cove of Rs.150,000 for one year ?or in other words, the family can claim up to Rs.150,000 during the tenure of the FD (one year).
?

?Sri Lankan Tamils issue not at all a poll issue?: Congress
	
The Sri Lankan Tamils issue is not at all a poll issue in the Assembly elections, said Congress leader K. V. Thangkabalu.
This was not a poll issue even way back in the 2009 Lok Sabha elections, when the problem was at its peak in the island nation. The Sri Lankan Tamils issue had taken a back seat then.
The DMK-Congress alliance under the UPA registered comfortable win in a majority of Lok Sabha constituencies in the State in that election, he said. It continues to be non-issue as far as Tamil Nadu elections are concerned, he said.
Mr. Thangkabalu said that it was regrettable that the AIADMK preferred to present a petition to the Chief Election Commissioner opposing the transfer of IAS and IPS officials in the State.
The Election Commission in the 2011 Assembly elections transferred many IAS and IPS officers at the instance of the AIADMK, he recalled.
Mr. Thangkabalu said that the Jayalalithaa regime had done nothing to augment power production in the State.(The Hindu)

Tale bearer in hot water
	
?
It is a home truth that firm, upright and honest white collar ones in the public sector are a rare breed. ?Among the few such men of integrity available, there is one functioning as the chairman of several state institutions. One of the state institutions he helms is one handling finance. There is another one connected to mass media.?
?
None would dare try to influence this white collar high-up with years of experience in the public sector behind him.
Meanwhile, a certain director known to be an unsavory character and a typical hanger-on is said to be whispering various allegations against the upright white collar high-up to high political authorities on a regular basis.?
Later both high political authorities had made a perfunctory inquiry from the chairman about the complaints made by the director. Then the chairman had read out a list of serious charges -- most of them relating to abuse of public funds ? being preferred against the tale- telling director.?
A high political authority who attentively listened to these charges, had said: ?We didn?t know that he is such a bad character. You may take necessary action against him. If there is any problem, refer the matter direct to me??
