Appoint a Parliamentary committee before PCoI: GL
	
It was much fitting to appoint a parliamentary committee to look into the affairs of the recent unrests before a Presidential Commission of Inquiry (PCoI) to be appointed over the investigations, the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) Head Prof. G.L. Peiris said today.
Addressing a news conference, he said PCoI would not come out with a comprehensive inquiry as it is not comprised of all political parties in Parliament representing all the communities.
?We have no objection in appointing a PCoI. But what is urgent now is to have an effective investigation into the incidents. Moreover, it was essential to see as to who will be appointed as the members of the PCoI and how long it takes to publish its final report. By appointing a Parliamentary committee, the final outcome would be more reliable than a PCoI,? Prof. G.L. Peiris said.
Therefore, they urge the government to appoint a Parliamentary committee and solve the crisis without putting the people into further trouble. (Sheain Fernandopulle)?

China approves ?President for life? change
	
?
DPA, 11th MARCH, 2018-The Chinese parliament on Sunday scrapped presidential term limits, paving the way for President Xi Jinping to rule indefinitely over the world?s most populous country.
Out of 2,963 delegates at the annual session of the National People?s Congress, 2,958 voted yes to changing the constitution.
Three abstained and two voted against, the parliament announced.
The results were shown on a blue screen inside the cavernous Great Hall of the People. The delegates voted using paper ballots, which they filled out and dropped inside red ballot boxes.
?We all support it, and I think no one will oppose it because it?s an advanced law, and it?s correct,? said Chai Wenlong, a delegate from Heilongjiang province, minutes before voting began.
?We support everything as long as it will benefit the people,? added Pan Ping, a delegate from Guangxi province, who donned a blue traditional costume of the Zhuang minority, as is common for representatives of ethnic minorities. She ?absolutely? hopes Xi can rule indefinitely, she said.
The constitutional amendment package, which was announced only two weeks ahead of Sunday?s voting, came as a surprise to Chinese intellectuals and observers. It marked a stark reversal in the direction of Beijing politics, which in the past 30 years has followed a ?collective leadership model? in order to prevent the unilateral - and sometimes catastrophic - decision-making that occurred under communist China?s founder, Mao Zedong.
The Communist Party has rotated its leadership every decade since former leader Deng Xiaoping in 1982 abolished ?lifelong leadership tenure.?
But after Xi, 64, became president in 2013, he quickly consolidated power and swept away his opponents in a wide-ranging anti-corruption campaign.
Xi?s power play was also foreshadowed at the twice-a-decade Communist Party Congress last October, when the party appointed five new members of the all-powerful Politburo Standing Committee, none of whom was young enough or had the credentials to become Xi?s successor.

China should assure OBOR won?t threaten other countries: MS
	
President Maithripala Sirisena has said that China should make it clear that its 'One Belt One Road' (OBOR) initiative will not pose any threat to other countries, NHK World reported today.
President Sirisena has made these remark in an interview with NHK ahead of his visit to Japan on Monday. He will meet Prime Minister Shinzo Abe during his stay.
President Sirisena, who won the 2015 presidential election by defeating pro-China incumbent Mahinda Rajapaksa, pledged to uphold a well-balanced foreign policy.
NHK said Sri Lanka?s Hambantota Port was leased out to China for 99 years in return for Beijing's waiving of more than a billion dollars of Sri Lankan debt.
The port will be the largest in South Asia, and is expected to play a key role in the One Belt, One Road plan.
President Sirisena said that China should make it clear that it will not pose any threat to other countries.
He said he understands concerns that Beijing could use the port for military purposes. But he said doing so would violate the bilateral agreement and promised that his government will never allow that to happen.
He expressed enthusiasm for Japan's plans to build quality infrastructure in his country in an effort to promote a free and open Indo-Pacific region.

Current issues because govt. following NGO?s advice: Gota
	
Former defense secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa said yesterday the main reason for most of the issues in the country was the result of following the advice of NGOs rather than seeking advice of the Maha Sanga.
The government was acting on the instructions of the Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) instead of seeking the advice of the Maha Sanga, Mr. Rajapaksa said at an event in Kandy.
?The government has forgotten religious values, our culture and sovereignty and this has resulted in various issues within different sections of society, ?he said and added that that during his time, they invited religious leaders to the defense ministry and sought their advice when the country faced serious issues like today.
Mr. Rajapaksa said it was pointless giving priority to Buddhism only in the Constitution.

Responding to Sri Lanka's temporary ban on social media including Facebook, the company has said it is in contact with the Sri Lankan government and non-governmental organizations to support efforts to identify and remove hate speech.
?We have clear rules against hate speech and incitement to violence and work hard to keep it off our platform. We are responding to the situation in Sri Lanka and are in contact with the government and non-governmental organizations to support efforts to identify and remove such content,? Facebook has said in an email to the CNBC.
The CNBC article written by its Technology Reporter John Shinal was focused on how Sri Lanka did what the US can't, which was pulling the plug on Facebook over hate speech and fake news.
It said the ban in Sri Lanka came after several years in which critics have said Facebook and the government were not doing enough to prevent the spread of such harmful posts.

Govt. maintains social media ban to tackle anti-Govt. sentiments: PHU
	
The Pivithuru Hela Urumaya (PHU) today said the government was attempting to suppress anti-government sentiments by banning social media platforms and urged the government to lift the ban immediately.
Addressing a news briefing, PHU Leader MP Udaya Gammanpila said a number of users had utilized social media platforms to express their sentiments against the government during the recent past.
"The violent incidents in Kandy are no more and the curfew has been lifted. The State of Emergency would be expired on Wednesday but the ban on social media is still in effect. The government which came to power to ensure freedom of expression attempts to suppress social media today hiding behind Kandy violence. We won't allow this to succeed," he said.
He said the ban was impractical and youth population was using alternative means to access social media. ?When youths have logged on, the President and Prime Minister were also seen already using Facebook. They have accessed social media during the ban. If social media is acceptable to the two leaders, why not for the people?? he said.
Meanwhile, he said the government skipped two hurdles during the Kandy violence last week. He said the government forcefully passed the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance (ICPAPED) Bill in Parliament, the first hurdle.
?The second hurdle was UNHRC calling for UN member countries to use universal jurisdiction in Sri Lanka,? he said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

A group of Japanese experts say they have found the sea around Sri Lanka as most suitable for aquatic plantation, in a research conducted by them.
They have recently handed over the report on their research to the Minister of Fisheries Mahinda Amaraweera.
Aquatic plants are rich in hygienic properties and it is largely consumed by people in foreign countries. However, Sri Lankans are still not accustomed to use of the sea plant, Minister said.
Aquatic plantation is also a profitable export food variety. For the first time Sri Lanka exported 52 metric tonnes the last year and earned an income of Rs. 5.5million and it has a potential of earning huge income in the future with the expansion projects, according to the minister.
Sea strips from Galle to Hambantota, Arugam Bay to Trincomallee and Chilaw to Mannar are more suitable for aquatic plantation.
An aquatic plant tissue culture centre has been set up in Rambodagalla Kurunegala to propagate the aquatic plantations. (Dayaseeli Liyanage)

Satisfying  walk through Minefield But I have  issues
	
A Thousand Voiced Choir by Madhubhashini Disanayaka-Ratnayake is an unusual book. It traces her experiences as head of the English Language Teaching Unit (ELTU) of the Sri Jayewardenepura University during the first two years.It is unusual because we have a very large number of English teachers in this country, of all levels, and nobody as far as I can recall, has ever written a detailed account their teaching experiences.
?
Madhubhashini Disanayaka
A Thousand Voiced Choir is the story of a satisfying walk through a minefield, satisfying because the author?s account of those two years is by all means positive.
English teaching is a minefield. Despite there being so many schools, and tuition gurus, who claim to have brought English fluency to tens of thousands, while laughing all the way to the bank, the desperation to learn English by masses of students is more evident than ever, and it is hard to find a fluent speaker or writer in English. In that context, Madhubhashini?s account of how this life-or-death task was tackled at university level is of untold historical value.
She has one thousand undergraduates with very basic English, or not even that, and five teachers, not enough classrooms and facilities. But she takes on this mammoth task, with a ?can-do? spirit which is reflected boldly in the book?s 144 pages. The book is lavishly illustrated with black-and-white photographs. The last page carries one of a protest poster at the university. It says: ?Affirm the rights of students to study in the English medium,? testimony to the success gained by the ELTU.
?
"A Thousand Voiced Choir is the story of a satisfying walk through a minefield, satisfying because the author?s account of those two years is by all means positive. "
?
The author, a Gratiaen Award winner and Fulbright Scholar, and the daughter of a renowned Professor of Sinhala is ?divided in the vein? as she puts it:
?I myself was ?divided in the vein? as Derek Walcott termed it, between the two cultures. I studied in a Christian Missionary School, where I was the President, in my senior year, of both the Sinhala Society and the Buddhist Society. Both my daughters attend the same Christian Missionary School, but often have Pirith on their birthdays and go to the temple. I write short stories and novels in English but write about Sinhala speakers most of the time. I believe that English has to be learnt but that didn?t mean that you should look down on your own culture. I hated Western accents in Sinhala or Tamil speakers, I hated people making fun of the ?native? accent?I didn?t believe that not knowing English gave you no right to advance in life.?
Starting from scratch, the ELTU acquires a pleasant ?English learning zone? in the main library, enough classrooms and teachers so that groups of 6 or 7 members can study on a rotational basis. The author deals with bureaucratic Catch-22 situations and reduces red tape to a minimum. She believes in keeping things short and simple.
The ELTU staff members attend workshops which improve their teaching skills. The students have their own Facebook page; perhaps the crowning moment of all this effort comes when they sing the Pete Seeger classic ?Where Have All the Flowers Gone.?
While some can take English studies for granted, for those from rural schools with mediocre English teachers or no teachers at all, studying the language at university level can be a daunting prospect. The author writes about one female student who habitually frowned when attempting to speak in English out of fear. But the ELTU throws in two drama teachers, as well as meditation and Dhamma discussions in English, film shows and books, in a bid to break down inhibitions, quell fears, calm nerves and to create an environment and mindset conducive to studying a difficult subject.
The book contains too, a history of the Sri Jayewardenepura University. The author discusses the role of Sinhala and English in our universities. As she puts it:
?The irony of being appointed as Head of the English Language Unit of the Sri Jayewardenepura University was not lost on me when I received my letter of appointment in 2011. This is the university that prided itself on being the first university to offer degree courses in Sinhala, (The pioneers of university education ? the University College of Colombo ? had chosen English as the medium of instruction).
?
"To succeed nowadays, more often than not, one doesn?t need English. Once you make it, all you have to do is to hire those who have spent years studying it for a pittance."
?
?The creation of this university was a reaction against the elitism inherent in English education.? All in all, this is an eye-opening work. But I have a few criticisms. Take, for example, the following passage.
?Anyone conversant with the social factors in Sri Lanka would immediately know that anyone who knows how to speak English like a native speaker has come from a background of relative affluence and with it, the ability to meet the world with confidence and style. It was that, which was being looked for ? and that was why it was so difficult for someone who had learnt English as a Second Language as an adult to compete with someone who was always fluent in English, in the job market. It wasn?t just knowledge of the language; it was the less clear class markers that were being looked for in the Sri Lankan economic arena that was increasing -- and for me, agonizingly ? following Western models without any doubts whatsoever, despite the obvious breakdowns in the USA and Europe, who have seen the harm multinational companies and global banks have done to the economies of the world. That again is an aside ? but in a way relevant here, because this attitude harms the local Art student who is poorly equipped to successfully enter the employment market in Sri Lanka.?
?
I have several criticisms of the above passage. I apologise in advance for taking myself as an example. This isn?t due to vanity but simply because literary criticism at one level is as subjective as creative writing is.
A personal point of view does not necessarily lead to prejudice, which is what we must avoid. I take myself as the example because, within this context at any rate, I know myself better than anyone else. Looking at that first passage, if we take: ?Anyone who knows how to speak English like a native speaker has come from a background of relative affluence and with it, the ability to meet the world with confidence and style. It was that which was being looked for ? and that was why it was so difficult for someone who had learnt English as a second language as an adult to compete with someone who was always fluent in English, in the job market.?
?
I hardly know any Sri Lankan who knows how to speak English like a native speaker, if by that the author means a British citizen (unless it is someone of British origin, like the late Dr. Arthur C. Clarke, who became a Sri Lankan citizen, and assuming it is British English rather than American English that we are talking about. Actually, the younger generations speak a hybrid of British, American and Sri Lankan English).
I consider myself to be relatively fluent in English. But I don?t speak English like a native speaker. I have met Sri Lankans who are even more fluent in English than myself. But none of them speaks it like native speakers unless they have lived and studied in the UK from their childhood. The grammar and syntax of a Lankan, fluent in English will match that of an educated British speaker. But the idioms are different. There are differences in vocabulary, too, though this will depend very much on the education of the speaker and subject matter involved.
Secondly, while I don?t dispute the author?s statement that such a speaker will come from a background of relative affluence (with real emphasis on ?relative?) I will dispute any suggestion that this automatically gives anyone the ability to meet the world with confidence and style. Apart from the language spoken, there are allied factors such as personality, family background, inner-drive and, unfortunately in Sri Lanka, political and connections.
Those matter everywhere but over here, it is still a case of whom you know more than what you know. Of course, this will depend on the job. Connections won?t get anyone a job with a foreign embassy as a translator.
?
"As for any advantages in the job market, that would depend on the job context. That might be true in sectors like sales of up-market products, and banking, though in banking that hardly seems to be the case when it comes to state banks. It is no longer true of politics and business"
But there are people who can?t write a decent letter in English, and speaking it badly, holding top Government jobs including the Diplomatic Service, and drawing astounding salaries and other perks, while people with fluent English labour under them for ridiculously low pay.?
If anyone is interested, I can personally cite examples, though not in print.
Nor has my English skills given me any notable advantage in the job market. When it comes to English?medium journalism, at any rate, many journalists are less than fluent in English, but they manage. This is true of almost all other job sectors. People manage, that?s all. Ever since I began working for newspapers in the 1980s, I have witnessed a massive shift to a Sinhala-oriented culture among what has till then been an English-speaking milieu. Nowadays, you?ll find a majority of cases with people working in English, but using Sinhala as a personal medium of communication. As for the class markers, my personal experience are that English proficiency has never has never been able to shift them in any significant degree.
?
While I can enjoy the delusion that a chat in English makes me socially acceptable to the upper crust ?native speakers? of the language, a post-conversational reality check should confirm the depth of this illusion. You always remain Persona Non-Grata. My personal observation is that the death is the greatest leveller, though when you go to a cemetery and look at the tombstones; even this doesn?t seem to be true. Money comes to a close second, and language proficiency a very distant third.
Of course, our urban job market has an insidious school and club-oriented network which parallels the obnoxious caste template, and I would not deny that class may ease some things in the job market, and the related marriage market. But the above-mentioned levellers will always remain true within their allotted slots. People check out more than an outsider?s English proficiency before opening doors.
I need to question too, the following statement: ??that was why it was so difficult for someone who had learnt English as a Second Language as an adult to compete with someone who was always fluent in English, in the job market.? But we have all of us learned English as a second language. The author is making a clear difference between those who learned English as adults and those who learned it as children. While the latter would have a better start, belonging to the latter category doesn?t mean automatic fluency in English. In my case, I always earned good marks for English studies (while studying in Sinhala medium government schools) but fluency in the speech came as an adult (starting at the Advanced Level class when I started trying my English with a friend who was fluent).
?
Only my first school, Sri Sumanagala Vidyalaya at Panadura, could be said that offered a good standard of English. Isipathana and Ananda in Colombo, my subsequent schools, had poor English standards when I got to them. That would still put me ahead of anyone arriving in Colombo at 18 plus from a Madya Maha Vidyalaya from nowhere.
But many such people have moved ahead in life, and that?s not due to their English. As for the local Arts student, who is at a disadvantage in a globalised setting, which follows the Western model, the trouble is not just with English, but with other essential communications tools such as computer skills, plus the degree of sophistication needed to create the right image of oneself for that market. I feel that our education system fails to give that degree of sophistication to the average student, and that isn?t just due to lack of English, for there is nothing to say that sophistication is based on English knowledge alone.
As for any advantages in the job market, that would depend on the job context. That might be true in sectors like sales of up-market products, and banking, though in banking that hardly seems to be the case when it comes to state banks. It is no longer true of politics and business. We have an English-speaking elite and a Sinhala-speaking elite in both sectors.
?
"But there are people who can?t write a decent letter in English, and speaking it badly, holding top Government jobs including the Diplomatic Service, and drawing astounding salaries and other perks"
The English-speaking elite still have a foothold at national level politics and corporate business, though if we take the six presidents in our history, only two can claim to be fluent users of English. At the provincial level, it is overwhelmingly Sinhala dominated. Both elites are doing equally well, one might add.
Then again, we have an English-speaking class which is not an elite by any stretch of the imagination. Most of them use some English at work and at home. They are in the corporate sector, banks (mostly private), advertising (again, not everybody), teaching and the media. The latter is Sinhala dominated, but let?s consider this for a moment. The number of English speakers in Sri Lanka is estimated between 5 and 10 percent of the population; yet, the country has seven national newspapers in English.
Even if we accept that the circulation is based on advertising rather than news and features, we can only conclude that the impact of English in the country is far out of proportion to the actual number of speakers. One can argue endlessly about all this, but the position of English in our society is continually shifting in relation to local politics as well as its international position in politics and business.
?
English may be a proverbial sword, but the wielder is only effective as the socio-cultural armour that he is allowed to carry by inheritance, heritage and culture. If one makes a survey of the 100 richest people in the country, a surprising number may not be fluent in English or not have any English at all. The same would be true of knowledge, the other wealth. Can anyone argue that the English literature or journalism we produce is superior to its Sinhala counterpart? In this divided society, political connections matter as much as class, if not more, and money matters more than anything else, including race and caste prejudices.?
To succeed nowadays, more often than not, one doesn?t need English. Once you make it, all you have to do is to hire those who have spent years studying it for a pittance.

SC upholds marriage of woman who converted to Islam
	
?
Thiruvananthapuram, (Hindustan Times),10 March 2018 -??
Returning to her home state, Kerala, two days after the Supreme Court upheld the validity of her marriage to a Muslim man, Hadiya Jahan on Saturday blamed the ordeal she experienced on the fact that she had converted to Islam before the wedding.??
Hadiya, and her husband Shafin Jahan, called on the chairman of the Popular Front of India, E Abubaker, in Kozhikkode, north Kerala, to thank him and his organisation for providing legal help to reunite them.??
On Thursday, the Supreme Court upheld the validity of their marriage, overturning a Kerala high court order that annulled their marital union as a sham.??
Hadiya, born Akhila Asokan, converted to Islam in January 2016 and married Jahan in December the same year. In May 2017, the Kerala high court annulled the marriage on a petition by her father KM Asokan, an ex-serviceman who alleged that she had been indoctrinated and forcibly converted .

Telecommunication and Digital Infrastructure Minister Harin Fernando said today that restriction on the use of social media sites such as Facebook would most probably be lifted by tonight.
He told Dailymirror that the ministry and the Telecommunications Regulatory Commission (TRC) are in discussion with the Facebook service provider about filtering social media.
?It takes longer period to remove some posts such as hate speeches and child pornography published on the Facebook in Sinhala. International service providers do not have enough resources to monitor Singhala posts and that?s why we are having discussions with them on how to remove such post on Facebook.
Minister Fernando said President Maithripala Sirisena had given the authority to the ministry and the TRC over the matter.? ?

Speaker warns of Middle-eastern repercussions
	
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya yesterday warned of a possible repercussion on the employment opportunities for Sri Lankans in Middle- East countries if the racially motivated attacks against certain communities continued.
Addressing a gathering of ministers, parliament members, religious leaders and businessmen of all three communities at the Central Province Governor's office in Kandy, Mr. Jayasuriya stated that leaders of certain countries have been hurt by the violent incidents in the Kandy District.
"A large number of Sri Lankans are working in Middle East countries. If the leaders of those countries after being hurt over a certain community here being threatened, take steps to send back the Sri Lankans, it would affect the country in a big way" the Speaker warned after inspecting the situation in the areas where attacks on Muslim houses, businesses and mosques had taken place last week .
He pointed out that the riots had already taken a heavy toll on the tourism industry while a UN official visited the country to express the concern of the world body. He lamented that the situation tarnished the image of the country seriously.
Denouncing extremism and racism as a threat to all communities, the Speaker observed that no country could progress if these social maladies are condoned. "Countries have perished due to racism and extremism. We must ensure that there won't be a recurrence of the incidents that took place in Ampara and Kandy" he asserted.
Public Administration, Law and Order Minister Ranjith Madduma Bandara who attributed the spread of the violence to the false and slanderous social media propaganda stated that stern action would be taken against those responsible for the situation that defamed the country's image.
While the Secretary of the Muslim Traders Association A.C.M. Rahuman expressed displeasure over the conduct of the authorities responsible for the security of the area, Maulavi Fasrul Rahman bemoaned his community was hurt by the insults hurled against them. "We are not importing Arab culture here" he said and urged that those responsible for the mayhem be punished while compensation must be paid for the damages. (J.A.L.

?Former double agent Sergei Skripal, 66, and his daughter Yulia, 33, have been in hospital in a critical condition since Sunday, when they were found unconscious on a bench in the southern English cathedral city of Salisbury.? ?The two victims remain in hospital and they?re critical but stable,?

?Skripal betrayed dozens of Russian agents to British intelligence before his arrest in Moscow in 2004.? ?
?Many in British media and politics have speculated that Russia could have played a part in the attack on Skripal.? ?
?The Kremlin has denied any involvement in the incident and accused the British media of whipping up anti-Russian hysteria. The BBC reported late on Saturday that traces of the nerve agent had been found at Zizzi, an Italian restaurant where the Skripals had a meal before they were found unconscious.
