Biscuits banned in Sri Lankan dressing room: Gurusinha
	
Sri Lankan players are not allowed to eat biscuits in the dressing room, according to the team manager, Asanka Gurusinha.
Speaking exclusively from Sri Lanka on the rumor that the manager had a fight with the players on this issue and they broke the crockery in protest, the manager said, ?our physio and trainer are in charge of food at game and they have banned biscuits in the changing room?.
?The other day there were biscuits in the changing room and I informed the catering staff to take it out as our trainer did not want the players to eat in the changing room?.
?There was absolutely no argument with any players or support staff on this issue. In fact the players were even not aware that the biscuits were kept in the changing room?, he added.
?When the players heard this rumor, they even called me and told me not to worry and they all know that the news was not true and that they are all behind me?, Gurusinha further added.
The manager also dismissed the rumor of his resignation or being sacked.
?All the rumor regarding I have resigned is not true?, the manager concluded. It has also been confirmed with few other sources that the manager has NOT been asked to leave.
Gurusinha has been contracted with the SLC board till 2019. (Pakistan Observer)

Death of seven-feet leopard being probed
	
The Wild Life Conservation Department is probing the death of a seven-feet male leopard in the Deltota, Lulakanda area.
Assistant Forest Range officer G R Dharmarathna told the Daily Mirror that the leopard was found dead on Monday evening following information provided by resident to the area wild life office.
An official from the Wild Life Conservation Department said the carcass of the leopard was handed over to the Peradeniya veterinary surgeon for a postmortem.
He said the reason for the leopard?s death had not been established so far.
The Sri Lankan leopard is a subspecies of leopards native to Sri Lanka that was first described in 1956 by the Sri Lankan zoologist Deraniyagala.
The leopard was listed as an Endangered species on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List in 2008 is also an offense to kill, trade or harm a leopard under the Wildlife Act. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

## Title: Easing your wheezing

Easing your wheezing
	
Wheezing is a general health condition that a lot of people experience, especially quite common in little children. It?s a whistling sound made while breathing that could occur either as a symptom of a disease or due to other causes and conditions. Common as it is, a disease by any other name is still a disease and should be prevented at all costs. Prevention becomes effective when the condition of a disease is understood from the grassroots level. So [Dr. Kosala Karunaratna, Consultant Paediatrician, Lady Ridgeway Hospital, Colombo] answered all questions, from the cause to the cure, that breeze their way into inquiring minds on this wheezy threat. ?
?
Definition
?According to Dr. Karunaratna, wheezing is a continuous whistling sound produced in the respiratory airways of the lungs during breathing. ?Narrowing or obstruction of respiratory pathways leads to the wheezing sound,? he stressed. ?
?
Causes ??
Dr. Karunaratna listed several reasons for wheezing. ?Wheezing could arise due to allergies to various stimulants such as dust. External factors such as foreign bodies from the environment could result in blocking of respiratory passages. This leads to wheezing as well. These factors include dust, microscopic organisms known as mites, viral illnesses, environmental pollution and even drugs such as aspirin and other painkillers like Brufen. Intrinsic factors such as Genetics and a family history of wheezing give reason to a higher probability of contracting the condition. Lung diseases, mainly asthma, hold wheezing as a symptom.? ??
?
Signs and symptoms ?
The most obvious telltale sign of wheezing is of course the whistling sound made during breathing. Other symptoms include shortness of breath, difficulty in breathing and the tightening of the chest. ??
?
Diagnosis ?
Dr. Karunaratna stated that wheezing is diagnosed mostly through symptoms shown by patients rather than tests. ?Wheezing is mostly diagnosed by symptoms though sometimes tests are also done to confirm the condition. Tests are performed to determine disorders when wheezing becomes a recurring issue. Tests can also confirm a patient?s allergies that cause wheezing. But wheezing is commonly diagnosed by symptoms,? he said. ??
?
Treatment?and cure ?
When wheezing is a symptom of a disease like asthma, it should be controlled. ?A common treatment method is the use of inhalers. There are 2 types of inhalers namely relievers and preventers. Relievers are inhalers used at the moment the symptoms show, when wheezing is aggravated. Preventers are inhalers that have to be used on a long term basis to keep the wheezing condition suppressed,? stated Dr. Karunaratna. ?
?
There is a particular procedure that has to be followed when using an inhaler. Wheezing is very common among children and sometimes the inhaler may not be administered properly in small children. To serve the purpose of using the inhaler properly and effectively in small kids, a device known as a spacer is used with the inhaler. This ensures high effectiveness of the inhaler in the treatment of wheezing in children. ??
Dr. Karunaratna also mentioned that long term wheezing is also treated with oral medicines. During instances where wheezing is highly aggravated- where a patient finds difficulty in breathing and talking and complains of chest pains-nebulisation is called for. ??
?
Path to prevention ?
Intrinsic as well as extrinsic factors contribute to the development of the wheezing condition. While intrinsic factors such as genetics and family history can?t be controlled, Dr. Karunaratna accentuated that steps can be taken to prevent wheezing with regards to extrinsic factors which are responsible for causing wheezing. Factors like house dust and dust mites that trigger wheezing can be prevented through regular dusting, cleaning and good ventilation.?
A good lifestyle and behavioural patterns can be adopted to keep away from other illnesses, especially viral ones. ?Animal fur and saliva, especially from cats, can also trigger wheezing in individuals. Therefore people who keep pets at home have to be mindful of hygiene and cleanliness of the home environment,? Dr. Karunaratna stressed further. ?

Flood relief and reconstruction work -- Why are funds underutilized: PM
	
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe today asked government officials why they had failed to spend the funds released by the Treasury for the reconstruction of flood-hit areas in the South and to provide relief to the affected people.
He raised this matter when he met some public servants during a visit to Morawaka
?Sri Lanka has lost Rs.108 billion from the recent floods and the Treasury has released Rs.60 billion for reconstruction and relief work. However some of these funds have not been spent. Usually when I visit floods-hit areas the complaint is that funds have not been released. However the situation is different today as I will have to ask the officers why they have not spent the funds released to them,? the Prime Minister said.
He said there have been delays in releasing funds from the Treasury but stressed that a considerable amount of funds had been released and added that he would call for reviews every two weeks on the reconstruction work being carried out in these areas.
?We hope to introduce a new protective label for locally-manufactured or imported liquor to control illegal liquor entering the market. This has to go through the Attorney General and under tender procedures and was subjected to delays in implementation. This delay has cost the government a Rs.1 billion,? the Prime Minister said.
He said the Ministries of Finance and Plantation Industries were currently discussing a programme to revive the tea industry which was hit by floods. The Prime Minister said the government would assist those plantation industrialists who were willing to export their produce directly. He said rubber estates in areas such as Awsissawella will be utilized for factories. The Prime Minister said rubber would be planted in new areas such as Matale and that the government was planning to start up a tourism project with the Sinharaja forest in mind. (Yohan Perera)

Geoffrey and Arjun's Perpetual Capital Holdings received Rs. 348 mn dividends: PTL CEO
	
PTL CEO Kasun Palisena yesterday said that Perpetual Asset Management paid Rs. 348 million dividends to Perpetual Capital Holding owned by Geoffrey Aloysius (father) and Arjun Aloysius (son) in November 2016. When Justice Prasanna Jayawardena questioned the witness about it, he said that he was unaware as to what happened to that money afterwards.
On being questioned by the Commission as to what happened to Rs. 712 million dividends paid by PTL to its 100% shareholding company, Perpetual Asset Management Pvt Ltd (PAM), the witness yesterday explained how the dividends have been distributed during the time period after he was appointed as a non executive director of PAM in February 2016.
President?s Counsel Kalinga Indatissa appearing on behalf of Palisena yesterday led the evidence in relation to the questions raised earlier by the Commission.
The Witness said he first joined PTL in November 2013 as the chief dealer and later in January, 2015 was appointed as the CEO of PTL. Then, he was appointed as a non executive director to the Board of Directors at Perpetual Asset Management (PAM), which is the 100% shareholding company of PTL in February 2016.
The witness said that he has no relationship with Perpetual Capital Holdings, which owns Perpetual Asset Management.
When Justice Prasanna Jayawardena questioned, the witness said he was aware about two dividends payments from PTL to its 100% share holder, Perpetual Asset Management after he became a non executive director of PAM in February 2016.
According to the witness, Rs.90.09 million dividends on August 8, 2016 and another Rs. 348.255 million dividends on September 19, 2016 had been paid from PTL to PAM during his tenure as a director of PAM (total of Rs. 458.548 million).
The witness said only about the dividends paid during the time after he was appointed as a director of PAM. There were dividends declarations submitted earlier by PTL before the Commission with regard to previous years as well.
However, when the Commission questioned as to how PAM spent the given dividend in 2016, the witness said as a non executive director of PAM he was aware that Rs. 642.69 million dividends was invested to buy voting shares of NDB, Central Finance and Lanka Ashok Leyland through PAM?s subsidiary company called Perpetual Equity Pvt Ltd.
He also said another Rs. 348 million dividend of Perpetual Asset Management (PAM) was given to Perpetual Capital Holdings, which was the owning company of PAM, headed by Geoffrey Aloysius (father) and Arjun Aloysius (Son).
Justice Prasanna Jayawardena: You were a Director of Perpetual Asset Management in August 2016?
Witness: Yes
J: PAM received a net dividend of Rs. 90 million from PTL on August 8, 2016
W: Correct
J: Then PAM receives a net dividend of Rs. 348 million also from PTL?
W: Yes
J: So, during your tenure as a Director of Perpetual Asset Management, PAM received Rs. 458.548 million by way of dividends from PTL?
W: That is correct.
J: What happened to that Rs. 458 million?
W: Rs. 642 million was used to invest in buying voting shares of NDB, Central Finance and Ashok Leyland. And the Rs. 458 million received as dividends was also included in that Rs. 642 million.
The witness was of the view that PAM through its subsidiary company called Perpetual Equity had invested in buying NDB shares using Rs. 642 million.
J: You are a financial person please be careful in giving evidence. Did Perpetual Equity function as a stock broker?
W: Not a stock broker but it only invested in shares.
J: So, Perpetual Equity bought those shares of Central Finance, Lanka Asok Leyland and NDB under Perpetual Asset Management?
W: Yes
J: So, these shares are owned by Perpetual Equity from the part of funds received as dividends by PAM from PTL?
W: Yes
When Justice Jayawardena asked in which manner PAM had invested through its subsidiary Perpetual Equity to buy those shares, the witness said it was a way of lending given by PAM to its subsidiary.
W: There was another dividend of Rs. 348 million in Perpetual Asset Management which was paid to Perpetual Capital Holding in November 2016.
J: And what happened to that money?
W: I am not involved in Perpetual Capital Holdings (PCH).
J: Perpetual Capital Holding is owned by Geoffrey Aloysius and Arjun Aloysius, father and son, is that correct?
W: Yes
J: So, that money was paid to the Father and Son, who owned PCH.
W: That is correct
J: Do you know what happened to that money?
W: I don?t know about that.
It was also revealed that in addition to the shares that Perpetual Equity owns of Central Finance, Lanka Asok Leyland and NDB, The PTL also has Rs. 1.1 billion worth of shares of NDB. This gives Perpetual Group a total acquisition of Rs. 2 billion worth of NDB shares.
Meanwhile, after being questioned by Chairman of the Commission, Justice K.T. Chitrasiri over the lack of information in the submitted financial details, the Counsel who appeared for W.M. Mendis & Company yesterday told the PCoI that they will furnish all the financial details asked by the Commission within a week.
Justice Chitrasiri yesterday told President?s Counsel Anuja Premaratne that the Commission had received only a Balance sheet without the entirety of how all the expenditure and income happened.
When PC Premaratne agreed to provide them soon Justice Prasanna Jayawardena said those details might be with the audit company of the W.M. Mendis & Company.
The Commission also questioned on the required bank statements of W.M. Mendis & Company. PC Premaratne said that they have written to the banks and will be able to provide the original bank statements within a week?s time.
It was also revealed that W.M. Mendis & Company has provided its financial details relating to 12 bank accounts to the Commission.
In the Meantime, Perpetual Treasuries Ltd CEO Kasun Palisena yesterday undertook to provide details regarding its phone recording system in an affidavit as required by the Attorney General?s Department with the assistance of PTL IT expert.
The witness was of the view that he did not negotiate with the Metropolitan Company when installing the phone recording system in PTL. He said it was the IT expert who negotiated with them and he would be the best person to explain about the system.
The witness also said that the system is customized up to a certain point. When questioned by Justice Jayawardena on the manner in which the system was customized, Palisena said he will provide the details in an affidavit with assistance of the IT expert. (Shehan Chamika Silva)

How pregnant women can deal with  back pain
	
?
?Eighty percent of women will experience back pain at some point during pregnancy. The severity of this pain during pregnancy ranges from mild discomfort after standing for long periods of time to debilitating pain that interferes with daily life. Although back pain during pregnancy can be a sign of a more serious condition, including labour, in most cases, it is the result of changes happening within the body. You?ve got lots of company! Most pregnant women experience back pain, usually starting in the second half of pregnancy. ?
You should know that there are things you can do to minimize your back pain. Dr. Sujeewa Weerasinghe the National Organizer of the Chartered Society of Physiotherapist tells us what really helps! ?
Causes?
There are a number of reasons for back pain in pregnancy.?
Here are the main ones.
Ligament softening hormones cause your joints to move more than usual, causing extra strain on your back and hips. ?
Postural problems caused by your growing uterus and stretched abdominal muscles that restrict you from being able to maintain proper alignment. ?
Your baby?s weight causes your lower back to sway as your center of gravity moves forward making back muscles short, tight, and painful. ?The position of your baby (particularly towards the end of pregnancy) can compress nerves and cause back pain. ?Due to your baby?s ever increasing weight, back pain is often worse in the later stages of pregnancy as your bub grows heavier. Pregnancy back pain typically happens where the pelvis meets your spine, at the sacroiliac joint. ?
There are many possible reasons why it happens.?
Here are some of the more likely causes: ?
Weight gain- During a healthy pregnancy, women typically gain between 25 and 35 pounds. The spine has to support that weight. That can cause lower back pain. The weight of the growing baby and uterus also puts pressure on the blood vessels and nerves in the pelvis and back. ?
Posture changes-Pregnancy shifts your center of gravity. As a result, you may gradually-even without noticing- begin to adjust your posture and the way you move. This may result in back pain or strain. ?
Hormone changes-During pregnancy, your body makes a hormone called relaxing that allows ligaments in the pelvic area to relax and the joints to loosen in preparation for the birth process. The same hormone can cause ligaments that support the spine to loosen, leading to instability and pain. ?
Muscle separation-As the uterus expands, two parallel sheets of muscles (the rectal abdominis muscles), which run from the rib cage to the pubic bone, may separate along the center seam. This separation may worsen back pain. ?
Stress- Emotional stress can cause muscle tension in the back, which may be felt as back pain or back spasms. You may find that you experience an increase in back pain during stressful periods of your pregnancy. ?
?
Treatment?
More good news-Unless you had chronic backaches before you got pregnant, your pain will likely ease gradually before you give birth. ?
Meanwhile, there are many things you can do to treat low back pain or make it rarer and milder. ?
Exercise-Regular exercise strengthens muscles and boosts flexibility. That can ease the stress on your spine. Safe exercises recommended for most pregnant women include walking, swimming, and stationary cycling. Your doctor or physical therapist can recommend exercises to strengthen your back and abdomen. ?
Heat and cold-Applying heat and cold to your back may help. If your health care provider agrees, start by putting cold compresses (such as a a bag of ice or frozen vegetables wrapped in a towel) on the painful area for up to 20 minutes several times a day. After two or three days, switch to heat. Put a heating pad or hot water bottle on the painful area. Be careful not to apply heat to your abdomen during pregnancy. ?
Improve your posture- Slouching strains your spine. So using proper posture when working, sitting, or sleeping is a good move. For example, sleeping on your side with a pillow between the knees will take stress off your back. When sitting at a desk, place a rolled-up towel behind your back for support. Rest your feet on a stack of books or stool and sit up straight, with your shoulders back. Wearing a support belt may also help. ?
?
Factors that influence back pain
The spine is vulnerable due to the following factors during pregnancy: ?
Hormone production during pregnancy makes joints less stable (to allow the pelvis to spread as the baby grows) ?
Typical weight gain of 25-35 pounds during pregnancy, with the majority or extra weight distributed around the abdomen ?
Increase in postural strain as the body compensates for changes in the pregnant woman?s center of gravity ?
Pain busters ?
Although back pain is common in pregnancy, there are things you can do to get some relief. Here are easy back ache busters to ease the tension on your spine. ?
Deep heat
A simple massage can be heavenly when you?re suffering from pregnancy back ache torture. Ask your partner to rub your back or indulge in a pregnancy massage. Pregnancy massage is specially designed to alleviate swelling and reduce stress on weight bearing joints. ?Heat packs can also alleviate back pain by improving blood flow to your aching muscles which encourages them to relax. Simply apply the heat pack for approximately 15-20 minutes to your sore back as often as every 3-4 hours. Be careful not to overheat your body though - heat packs shouldn?t be hot but feel comfortably warm against your body. ?
Posture pointers
It?s really important that you maintain good posture during pregnancy as standing tall will take the pressure off your already strained back.?
Try these posture pointers to get into line: ?
Always stand up tall and straight with your shoulders back - as if trying to get your head to touch the ceiling. ?
Straighten your upper back, so that your ear, shoulder and hip are aligned. Tuck your pelvis under using the pelvic tilt. ?
Contract your abdominal muscles and buttocks to act as a natural ?corset? for your lower back. ?
When sitting make sure your back is supported by a small pillow in the curve of your spine to encourage you to sit up straight. ?
When sitting don?t cross your legs as this decreases circulation. ?
Don?t wear high heels!
Sleep easy

How we got to where we are
	
This Government has those leftover hurrah-boys who still think that what transpired on January 8, 2015 was a revolution
?
The democratic process is premised on the idea that we don?t owe our representatives anything, except the ?gratitude? that we must pay through taxes and other levies to maintain public services. It?s a two-way street; you pay to keep those services and they run the country through what we pay. Nothing that goes beyond this can be considered as gratitude. What goes beyond can hence only be considered as servility. Servility of the most nauseating, ridiculous sort. The kind that adorns politicians whose pasts have been tarnished thanks to allegations of graft, abuse, and misappropriation. I am not singling out the present regime here, incidentally. ?
I know this government has those leftover hurrah-boys who still think that what transpired on January 8, 2015 was a revolution, never mind that revolutions can?t be sustained if those who were part of the status quo that worked against the ?revolutionaries? are hired by the latter as their lackeys (as this government has done). Expedience is sometimes considered the better part of imperative, sadly, which is why we have to sacrifice principles, but even adjusting for that the government has failed to deliver on the brief we gave them. Anyone who bats for this regime using revolutionary rhetoric, then, clearly needs to look up the word in the dictionary. ?
?
?
But these revolutionaries are just part of the crowd that keeps on batting for the Government. Consider the other elements, i.e. those who applaud its representatives on the basis of their arbitrary conceptions of democracy, elitism, and meritocracy. It?s these conceptions that demarcate the Old Boys Club in the Government as well-intentioned technocrats, while the likes of Palitha Thewarapperuma and even Mahinda Rajapaksa are disparaged as backward. They will go to any lengths to defend even someone like Ravi Karunanayake on the premise that those they defend are worthy of eloquent praise. These claims wouldn?t stand the test of scrutiny, since the educated, as history has taught us, have not been better and indeed have been worse than the ?uneducated? in resolving several compelling national issues. ?
We?ve messed up our notions of decency and education so much that we look for the wrong indicators thereof when assessing our politicians. We will consider Dayasiri Jayasekara?s momentary gaffe at pronouncing Latin phrases as something to laugh and poke at. We will disregard the horrendous mispronunciations in Sinhala (yes, the mother tongue) being made every day in parliament. Some would say this is a symptom of our colonial hangover, but for me the problem goes deeper. Fact is, we?ve screwed up the fine line between being uneducated and indecent so much that we pick and choose politicians based on the image they project of their status. ?
?
?
"Given our political culture it?s no surprise that there were people who sobbed at Ravi Karunanayake?s departure. Whether or not these people were ?paid? to do what they did is beside the point. What?s important is that they were there, some of them even worshipping the man"
?
A recent Facebook comment compelled my interest in this: ?Why we?re in this rut as a country is because your generation was preoccupied with correcting ?e?s and ?a?s instead of doing anything constructive.? The comment was aimed at those who were more interested in grammar and pronunciation than in the spirit in which something was written or spoken. Reminds me of a certain Prime Minister who, in a heated argument in parliament with Robert Gunawardena, chastised him over a grammatical faux pas or slip of the tongue the latter made, with his own classic slip of the tongue: ?Why don?t you speak a language you understand? Speak Sinhalese?? ?His tones left no doubt that this [Sinhalese] was a language fit only for the lower orders,? Regi Siriwardena later wrote. That Prime Minister, incidentally, was not a rightwing elitist. He was S. W. R. D. Bandaranaike. Telling, I should think. ?
Given our political culture it?s no surprise that there were people who sobbed at Ravi Karunanayake?s departure. Whether or not these people were ?paid? to do what they did is beside the point. What?s important is that they were there, some of them even worshipping the man. What?s as important is that those who were hell-bent on ridiculing Mahinda Rajapaksa over his habit of holding up babies and consoling emotional, if not hysterical, supporters (right after he was defeated) are speechless and selective when it comes to this display of emotion and hysterics. To be sure, the fact of his departure, more forced than willingly conceded to by the alleged wrongdoer, speaks volumes about the political culture we are witnessing. But that political culture is still predicated on that timeless excuse for incompetency, relative merits. ?
?
?
Relative merits, ladies and gentlemen. The we?re-better-than-them argument, which has become too old and outpaced to be taken seriously. The problem with that argument, of course, is that it works both ways; the Mahinda Rajapaksa Cabal can use it just as effectively as this regime can. And in case you?re wondering, they are. The recent tirade against the Attorney General?s Department over what is alleged to be their partiality against members of the present government is symptomatic of a political culture that operates on such arguments. That?s not to say the Attorney General is to be absolved everywhere and with respect to every allegation, but then there?s a fine line to be drawn between constructive and baseless criticism. ?
What strengthens the relative merits argument is that the government is partly correct. They are better procedurally than the Mahinda Rajapaksa regime. What weakens it, on the other hand, is the point that it depends on whether the Government has been better than Rajapaksa?s regime at improving the democratic machine. There?s a difference between procedural and substantive democracy, after all. A careful perusal of every antidemocratic act taken by the government, any government, in the last three decades will prove that nearly all of them have been absolved by the argument that the state is the ultimate arbiter of political action, since it derives legitimacy from the fact of being elected by the people. The paradox of modern democracy is that it shields inequalities and deplorable state action under a facade of procedural correctness. ?
?
?
"Had Rajapaksa stalled any election, presidential, general, or provincial, he would probably have raised flak not just from the UNP, but probably also from the American, British, French, and even Indian Embassies. Delaying an election, any election, no matter how much one justifies it, is a serious transgression of the democratic process"
?
But consider this. We haven?t seen a repeat of Rathupaswala, at least not yet. Protestors were beaten up and continue to be beaten up and/or tear-gassed, but that is not as coercive as being killed or shot. There?s been a definite improvement in the way political dissidents are being accommodated (Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe being a good example), though that?s less a sign of political correctness than one of political lethargy. Allegations of graft and misappropriation do abound, but they are less than what we saw during the previous regime. Putting all these together, is our present political culture better than what it used to be? ?
I would be tempted to say yes, with some reservations. Political sycophancy still continues. Those who raised hell over Mahinda Rajapaksa?s supporters now stay shut over how they themselves are covering up the alleged wrongdoings of this government. Had Rajapaksa stalled any election, presidential, general, or provincial, he would probably have raised flak not just from the UNP, but probably also from the American, British, French, and even Indian Embassies. Delaying an election, any election, no matter how much one justifies it, is a serious transgression of the democratic process. Those who came to power in 2015 did so with the intent of transforming a culture in which expedience flourished into one where imperative and necessity would reign. Neither of the latter two has. Not yet. ?
Better than the rest, clearly, is an argument that endorses wrongdoing as long as it?s seen as better than what used to be. The problem with such an argument is that its parameters are arbitrarily set: just what is better, and just where is one to draw the line between them and us? Let?s not forget that we as a country are prone to political amnesia. Mahinda Rajapaksa and his cohorts can be, and probably are, behind the recent spate of strikes and the AG Department?s sway against the current regime. But even if we concede that they are, the relative merits thesis loses water when considering that no government elected on a platform of liberal democracy can sacrifice certain norms to get back at the opponent?s attempts to undermine them. And why? Because we simply don?t give a damn about that opponent. ?
?
?
This government?s slip is showing. Rather tellingly. It used to be said that political elitists were independent enough to not be swayed by the allure of power and wealth. Not true. If the recent past and the horde of allegations this regime has attracted are anything to go by, our political culture has improved only marginally, and that because of the demands for betterment that we, the people, and certain outfits we?ve organised for ourselves have made. The truth is that the same people who cried foul over Mahinda Rajapaksa and his cronies and supporters now write, say, or do anything and everything they can to justify what is being written, said, and done by their representatives. The trouble with that is that their representatives happen to be ours as well. The 5.8 million are, effectively, in the hands of the 6.2 million.

Human smuggling: 18-year imprisonment sought for Lankan in Canada
	
Crown lawyers in Canada are seeking an 18-year prison sentence for a Sri Lankan man convicted of human smuggling for his role in the voyage of the MV Sun Sea, CBC News?reported yesterday.
The MV Sun Sea ship was a dilapidated cargo ship that made the voyage from Thailand to British Colombia's coast with 492 Sri Lankan Tamils aboard seeking asylum.
Kunarobinson Christhurajah was found guilty in May 2017 during a retrial. His first trial ended in a mistrial after a jury couldn't reach a verdict.
Christhurajah was tried with three other men who were all acquitted of human smuggling charges.
During his initial trial, the court heard that Christhurajah was an asylum seeker who travelled on the Sun Sea with his wife. His lawyer maintained he acted for humanitarian reasons, either to assist their family members or to help fellow asylum seekers on the ship.
Meanwhile, Crown lawyers asserted he was the owner of the ship and one of the organizers of the voyage.
A sentencing hearing began Thursday in BC Supreme Court. Crown lawyer Charles Hough told the judge an 18-year prison sentence is appropriate.
"I appreciate that this is a severe sentence, but the Crown says that a severe sentence is warranted given the rather extraordinary circumstances of this case," said Hough.
Hough discussed the deplorable conditions of the ship, the overcrowding and the fact that passengers were charged exorbitant amounts to be part of the trip.
"It's a rare case, not just in Canada but elsewhere in the world."
The Crown told the judge that this is a case of international organized crime and that a strong sentence needs to be imposed for deterrence and denunciation.
Christhurajah is currently out on bail but served more than six years in jail. With credit for time served, the Crown said Christhurajah would serve an additional 11 years.
The sentencing hearing is expected to continue Friday, with submissions from Christhurajah's lawyer.

India clears $650 mn Boeing army chopper deal
	
?
NEW DELHI AFP Aug17, 2017 - India approved a $650 million purchase of six attack choppers Thursday from US aviation giant Boeing, officials said, as it boosts its military might amid border tensions with China and Pakistan. ??
The Defence Acquisition Council (DAC), which approves big-ticket purchases, gave the green light to acquire six additional Apache helicopters after 22 were bought as part of a $2.5 billion deal in 2015. ??
Two defence ministry sources told AFP on the condition of anonymity that the deal was approved exclusively for the army, without providing further details including a date for delivery. ??
??DAC approved procurement of six Apache helicopters along with associated equipment for the army totalling about 4,168 crore rupees ($650 million),? an official told AFP by text message. ??
The initial batch of 22 Apaches -- equipped with Hellfire and Stinger missiles -- replaced the Indian Air Force?s ageing fleet. ??

Investigating into the ?control issues? of the human body
	
?
As a part of our efforts to show our readers the subject of medicine in a different, more colourful light, we decided to take you through a different topic in the subject of ?medical physiology?, otherwise known as the study of the functions of the body. Read on to see if this particular area of medicine may pique your interest. ??
?The current world population is around 7.5 billion. Each of these human beings is unique and different from each other by their outside features as well as the way they think. But have you ever wondered how some of our physical qualities remain quite similar, even close to identical? How can the body temperature of me, who is living in tropical Sri Lanka, and that of an Eskimo both be between 36.5?37.5 ?C, within a difference of maximum of one degree Celsius? How can the blood reports say the normal range for blood pH is 7.35 - 7.45 in all 7.5 billion of us? ??
That is just one another marvel by the Mother Nature in creating life. The amazing ability of the body to keep these values within a narrow range is called ?Homeostasis?. Whether you are awake or asleep, exhilarated or grieving, your body is always alert. With the slightest change of the internal or external environment, it sends messages to the control room, aka the brain, which activates the mechanisms to immediately bring the body back to normal. ??
Let?s consider this in terms of temperature control. Say you are on a trip to the hill country. The temperature starts dropping outside, causing the internal temperature to drop too. The brain is immediately alerted and sends messages to the surface blood vessels, constricting them, thus reducing the heat loss from the skin to the environment. Your metabolic rate increases and you start shivering, which generates heat through contractin of skeletal muscles. And messages are sent to the conscious part of your brain, which you interpret as ?it?s pretty cold, I should put on my sweater?. ??
Similarly, when you travel to a really hot area, say down south or Anuradhapura, as a response to the increasing internal body heat, your sweat glands will produce sweat, which in turn cools off your body as it evaporates. The blood supply to the skin will increase, increasing the heat loss through radiation. The internal mechanisms will slow down, producing less heat as a result. ??
Many of the body?s conditions are maintained in a stable state due to this homeostasis. Information is sent into the brain, mostly in the ?negative feedback? form where the ?change? itself acts as a signal to prevent further changes in the system. ??
So what happens when these mechanisms fail? Since we promised not to give out depressing medical information in this particular article, just keep in mind that failure of the body to maintain its internal environment will give rise to many a complication. A minute change in temperature or the body ion levels has the potential to do serious damage to the body at the molecular level. Don?t worry overmuch though, your body has it under control. It?s amazing how the same body that trips over flat ground and rebels at getting up from bed in the morning manages such complicated proceedings, without our slightest knowledge, isn?t it? ? ??

Judging whether a woman would make an ideal wife
	
In countries in the East like Sri Lanka and India where divorce, separation or a second marriage is frowned upon, marriage is the most important event in one?s life. ?Marriage is also looked on as something sacrosanct. ?In fact, there is a general acceptance that one?s real life begins with marriage, in fact, a turning point in life for the better or the worse.
Success in marriage synonymous with success in life?
Marriage assumes such unique significance; a successful marriage is considered a synonym for the success in life. ?We all know either through experience or acquired intimate knowledge, failure in marriage means failure in life. ?There is a belief in Sri Lankan society that the success of marriage depends more on the woman than on the man. ?One may argue that this statement is a fallacy and both wife and husband are equally responsible for the success or the failure of marriage.?
Success in Marriage depends more on woman
However, due to the common belief that the qualities and the character of the female partner greatly account for the success or the failure of a marriage, the Buddhists and the Hindus in particular have come to attach great significance to obtaining a reading of the horoscope of the bride-to-be to ascertain whether she would make a virtuous and devoted wife.
What ancient rishis and Vedic astrologers have said about women in their great works has lent strength to this belief that the female partner is greatly responsible for making a marriage a success or a failure. Example, ancient Indian Maharishis have said that marriage to a virtuous woman would nullify all Arishta yogas her husband is subject to.?
Principles of Female Horoscopy
According to principles of Female Horoscopy, a woman is very fortunate if Moon and Jupiter as well as Mars and Venus are strongly posited in her horoscope. It is equally important to have the 2nd, 3rd, 5th and the 9th Houses free from malefic influences. Of course, it goes without saying that the Lagna, above everything must be strong. The best planet to occupy the Lagna of a female is the Moon.?
If there are benefic planets in the 2nd House and the lord of the 2nd house is either associated with benefics or aspected by benefics, the woman would lead a very happy life after marriage.
Kama Triangle factor?
The 3rd House of the Kama Triangle in the Natal Chart too is an important factor where marriage is concerned. A benefic posited in the 3rd House aspecting the 7th House is very favourable. ?If the 3rd House is ruled by a malefic and is occupied by another malefic and aspected by other malefics while the 2nd lord is associated with malefics, husband would not live long. If the 11th House is also affected in a similar manner while the 2nd is also afflicted, a similar fate would befall the husband.?
Significant planetary positions
Malefics in the 7th House and the lord of the 7th House associated with malefics would delay the marriage. If either Jupiter or Venus aspects a strongly posited Mars occupying the 7th House, the female would be a voluptuous beauty who would marry a powerful person occupying a position of authority. If an afflicted Mars or a weak Mars in the 7th House is aspected by a malefic, marriage would either break up or would be plagued by constant quarrels between wife and husband. ?It is an important astrological principle, that if Rahu is posited in the 7th House of a sign whose Navamsa is owned by Saturn in the Natal Chart of a female, both her husband and children would come to a tragic end. A girl would grow up into a charming and beautiful woman if the Moon is exalted in her horoscope. An exalted Moon in the 7th House signifies a successful marriage.
Strong Mars and Venus for early marriage - ?Moon and Jupiter for success in marriage It is Mars and Venus who are responsible for bringing about an early marriage. The role of Jupiter and the Moon is to ensure that the marriage is a success. ?Saturn and Ketu would delay the marriage. Rahu and the Sun would either delay or quicken the marriage falling in line with the stronger one of the Mars ? Venus and Saturn - Ketu combinations. ?Marriage is hastened when Saturn aspects Mars.
No marriage if Saturn aspects both Moon and Venus
A female with Saturn aspecting both Venus and the Moon in her horoscope would show no interest in marriage.?
The most important House in a horoscope be it of a male or a female, is the 9th House or Punyasthana. ?Slow moving planets like Jupiter and Saturn lead to yogas that delay marriage. ?Saturn aspecting Venus who is posited in a sign owned by the former would definitely delay marriage.
?However, if Saturn aspects Mars from wherever he is, marriage is hastened. ?Veteran astrologers say that if Saturn aspects the Moon from the 9th House marriage gets delayed. Jupiter in the 9th House would stall marriage, but when it happens it would be a great success.

Lankan charged with seducing married woman
	
A Sri Lankan was in the dock at the Magistrate's Court in Malaysia today facing two charges, issuing death threats and seducing another man's wife.
M. Suventhan, 31, however, claimed trial after the charges were read out to him in Tamil before Magistrate Salamiah Salleh.
Initially, the accused appeared nervous and failed to understand the charges against him so much so, the court interpreter had to repeat them twice.
On the first count, he was charged with issuing death threats against the husband of the woman he had seduced.
He is alleged to have committed this offence at the void deck of Blok Kondominium Ridzuan, in Sungai Way, here 9.15am on Aug 12.
He was charged under Section 506 of the Penal Code and is looking at a maximum two years jail or fine or both, if convicted.
As for the second, he was charged with enticing or taking away or detaining with a criminal intent, a married woman.
The charge was under Section 498 of the Penal Code which also provides for the same two types of punishment, if convicted.
Deputy public prosecutor Mary Phoon Keat Mee urged the court not to offer bail saying the accused, being a foreigner, was a flight risk.
The accused, who was not represented, told the court that he had no bailor.
The court did not offer bail and set Aug 20 for re-mention. (Yahoo news)

Mystic power generated by sound vibrations
	
?
People in our country like those in India, Nepal and Bhutan attach a great significance to giving a name to a newborn. In fact, they believe that giving a name to a book to be published, a new residence to move into, a business establishment to be launched or any other place or thing for that matter is as significant as giving a name to a newborn for that carries an occult power that determines not only the success or failure of the project, but also that of the person or persons associated with it.?
?
Swar Shastra in ancient times
The reason behind this deep-rooted belief among the people is the widespread acceptance that when sound-syllables of a name are in a certain pattern it would create vibrations carrying a mystic power which if properly harnessed can produce wonderful results both good and bad.?
The occult science dealing with sound vibrations has been a branch of the holistic astrological science from ancient times and had been described as Swar Shastra. Today this Swar Shastra has become part of Numerology widely practiced by Numerologists in the West.?
?
Origin of Swar Shastra
According to research done by numerologists of the West, Swar Shastra or the occult science based on sound vibrations had been in vogue as far back as 4000 BC in Sumer (once known as Babylon) and in other ancient civilizations in West Asia. ?Both Swar Shastra in India and Sumerian Numerology are based on sound- syllables that create vibration patterns. Sound vibrations, according to Phonetical Astrology are divided into four patterns described as Bhumi (Earth), Jala (water), Vahni or Agni (Fire), Vayu (Air), and Akasha, (Ether). ?These vibration patterns are known to people in our country as ?Gana?.
Astrologers in our country also observe the Swar Shastra principles relating to ?Gana? in selecting a name for a newborn, a place or a thing. ?It appears ?Gana? (the term used both in the singular and the plural) have been added to the five original ?Gana?, namely Deva, Chandra and Surya.?
?
Compositions based on sound vibrations
In fact, Mantras, Seth Kavi, and Vas Kavi widely used in our country for the purpose of healing the sick, invoke blessings, causing malefic effects and also exorcising evil spirits are compositions based on sound vibrations.?
It is believed that certain sound-syllables used at the beginning of a verse ? a phonetic pattern expected to be repeatedly chanted ? could cause either positive or negative results depending on its ?Gana? or the vibrational pattern.?
Certain sound-syllables could cause harm to the composer himself. ?There is a legend in the folklore that the celebrated poet monk Vidagama Ananda Maitriya Thera had to leave the shores of this country as the effect of starting the first verse of his great work, Budugunalankaraya with a word carrying the syllables of Vayu Gana. This verse:
Siyapin sirin saru
Detislakunen visituru
Sadaham gunen garu
Vandim muni utuman tiloguru
Is well known among the people in this country.

MYTH: Tooth decay is mainly caused by sugar ?
BUSTED: ?When it comes to tooth decay caused by sugar what happens is, the oral bacteria will act on the tooth surface to produce lactic acid and erodes the tooth after a period of time. There are four factors that are involved here, sugar, tooth surface, oral bacteria and time. But the main cause for tooth decay is when any type of food particle gets lodged on top of the tooth or in between the teeth. Bacteria will act on that and produces lactic acid that erodes the enamel, and if you don?t rinse it will erode to the dentin and again if you don?t rinse it will go in to the pulp. When it erodes in to the pulp it can be very painful and there can be swelling.? explained Dr. Vipula Wickramasinghe, General Secretary of the Sri Lanka Dental Association and Regional Dental Surgeon of the Colombo District. ? ??

Orphans disapprove how they are shoved into society
	
Not all among us are born under the lucky stars. Unfortunate instances in life place children under alternative care like in children?s homes and other child care institutions. Since a roof is provided to shelter them, one may think that they will be cared for. This may be the case for now, but this protection might not be a permanent feature throughout their lives as these children grow into adults. What many remain oblivious to is the fact that there often comes a time when children receiving alternative care are abruptly shoved into the world outside and are forced to face the future alone.? 
?Upon reaching age18, youth who have been receiving shelter and protection from child care institutions are often compelled by law to leave alternative care. This becomes a ?ready or not, out you go? kind of situation for these youth. They face numerous socio-economic and psycho-emotional issues as they try to make the transition from alternative care to independent living. This sudden push in to society has made such youth face many social challenges that hinder their potential of leading a stable independent life. Just like other 18-year-olds, these youth are no different and require support, advice and guidance. When they are deprived of these they fall into a trench of darkness. This has become a great issue in the country that hasn?t been addressed.? ?
SOS Children?s Villages Sri Lanka recently organized a speak out session where several youth shared their experiences of leaving alternative care at the age of 18. The effort behind this initiative was to make these youth heard, seen and recognized as an equal citizen with equal rights. This event was held to raise awareness regarding the plight of youth after reaching the age of 18. The organizers of the session have hope of accentuating the need to establish a proper mechanism and strengthen the framework of the system that provides for children leaving alternative care.? ?
I remember every instance that I applied for a job. All the other candidates would bring along a file. But what I brought along was my travelling bag because I was homeless
Akash
Four youths related their life stories at the speak out session. Their stories, full of emotions, brought tears to those in the audience. These stories were eye-openers to everyone. They highlighted how the youth struggled to step out from the protection of alternative care to the unprotected world outside. Not everyone who leaves alternative care are blessed with a four-leafed clover. Many don?t share these happy endings and their voices go unheard. That is why Akash Moses, Shashikala Shivarasra, Nimali Sriyakanthi Kumari and Iresha Dilhani have stepped forward and shared their stories about leaving alternative care, They don?t want sympathy, but wish to speak on behalf of youth to bring to light the unhappy plight of those who are unable to open a happy chapter in their lives after leaving alternative care.? ?
Akash Moses, now a youth rights activist and creator of the ?Voice for the voiceless? foundation, started his life journey at a children?s home in Kandy. Having been abandoned by his parents two weeks after birth, Akash had to lead a tough childhood that made him face many challenges and encounter barriers. But that didn?t stop him from producing the best O? Level results, while in school. ?My school life was a difficult time. I was labelled as an ?orphaned child?. But despite all the challenges, I was able to pass my O? Levels, getting the best results in my school. But during my A? Levels, I faced a lot of challenging situations I couldn?t bear. Some situations I faced, which involved my teachers, were unbearable. I couldn?t erase them from my memories. So I decided to stop my education,?he reminisced.? ?
And from the time I boarded the bus, the police took out my personal file and started scolding and blaming me. What was my fault?
Nimali
Akash related the feeling of being alone and helpless after leaving the children?s home at the age of 18. He was clueless as to what to do with his life. Suddenly spurred by the determination to win in life, he headed out to Colombo in search of employment. ?I remember every instance that I applied for a job. All the other candidates would bring along a file with their certificates and qualifications. But what I brought along was my travelling bag because I was homeless. If I got the job, I planned to utilize the accommodation facilities facilitated by the job. Otherwise I would take my travelling bag and go to the next interview.? he said. He had been taken in by a Pasteur and brought up at his residence for 7 years.
But Akash highlighted the fact that the identity associated with having been brought up at an orphanage clings to him no matter how further he progresses in life. Fighting tears he pointed out that all this was due to his birth certificate being an empty in sections where they mattered most. He said that the society has considered all these reasons before judging him and eventually being disrespectful of him. ?This is the piece of paper that determined my fate after turning 18,? he said, holding up his birth certificate. ?I don?t know my father?s name let alone the fact whether my parents were married. This piece of paper enabled the society to decide what I was to become. This decided the respect I would receive from society? he questioned.
I wanted to reach my targets and move forward faster. Amidst disapproval, I came to Colombo where I attended my first class in the graphic designing diploma
Iresha
Akash created the foundation titled ?Voice for the voiceless? through which he has been able to touch and change the lives of many children for the better. Through this foundation he has helped built several schools and preschools that provide educational facilities, shelter and protection to children who are victims of child abuse. Recalling the recent flood disaster, Akash was able to lend a helping hand to a crowd comprising 78,000 people and helped 29,000 families. He works hard to be the voice of socially abused children and is currently following a diploma in child psychology.? ?
?He beseeched the relevant authorities to change the concept of judging people by their birth certificates. He also pleaded with the public to not look down or discriminate those coming from children?s homes. ?
It?s a misconception to assume that all the children placed under alternative care are disowned by parents. Some have been placed in children?s homes due to the demise of parents while some have been brought there as their families can?t afford to raise children due to financial difficulties. There are children who have fallen victim to child abuse. Children who lost their homes during the war, striving to survive, also seek alternative care. Shashikala Shivarasra?s story is one among many.? ?
Due to the war in the country, Shashikala?s house had been burnt down. Every young heart harbours a dream. her dream was to become a math teacher. ?Because of my situation I always doubted about my dream becoming a reality. I couldn?t imagine going to school as my father didn?t have a permanent job and couldn?t bear the expenses for my education. But in order to achieve my dream I had to receive an education. So I came to the Jaffna SOS village. There I saw that there were many others who shared a similar fate. I studied for my O? Levels there,?said Shashikala.
I couldn?t imagine going to school as my father didn?t have a permanent job and couldn?t bear the expenses for my education. But in order to achieve my dream I had to receive an education
Shashikala
?Despite all barriers, she passed her exams and qualified to sit for the A? Levels. She went on to gain admission to the university. But at the age of 18 she had to leave the SOS village. ?I was burdened with my own thoughts. If I had to leave the village, how would I ever attend university? I thought that my life?s purpose was over. But the SOS village supported and funded me through the organization and thus helped me to continue my studies,?she recalled. ?
Fulfilling one?s dream brings immense satisfaction.? Shashikala had this kind of experience. She accentuated that until 18, children will receive care in some way. But once you reach 18 years of age, the case is different. ?No one cares once you are 18. A lot of people even avoided us. We had to move forward on our own,?she said.
When a child is deprived of parental care, getting placed in alternative care doesn?t bring an end to his or her troubles. There are many inconveniences that a child has to face even at the time of receiving care. Nimali Sriyakanthi Kumari?s life story explicits some of the hardships and the discrimination she experienced after coming from a children?s home.? ?
Nimali works at Sarvodaya Suwasetha institution. But 17 years ago she was raised at a children?s home in Kandy. Being a mischievous little child when young, Nimali remembered being shifted to a different children?s home in Nuwara Eliya. She was 14 years old then.? ?
She recalled the manner in which she was escorted to the children?s home in Nuwara Eliya. ?I was taken to the home in Nuwara Eliya with a policeman and policewoman in uniform and in a public bus. I was unable to comprehend the looks I was given by the passengers back then, but a realization has dawned now. And from the time I boarded the bus, the police took out my personal file and started scolding and blaming me. What was my fault? I didn?t come to a children?s home due to my fault. When these things happen, they fade away your dreams and and ruin your aspirations. I am not saddened by this now. But I would like to make a point that has to be brought to attention because these things still happen,?said Nimali.
?
?
Later she was transferred to Sarvodaya Children?s home and sent to school. But she was summoned to court every 6 months. She was frustrated. Few months before the O? Levels she had been banned from school. Even for the slightest mistake, children under alternative care were scolded and criticized.? Nimali has also recorded some of her songs on CD. This just goes to show that every child is special in his or her own way and posses many talents. But Nimali was deprived of following her passion for? music during her A? Levels and she had no other choice, but to pursue other subjects.? ?
At the age of 21, Nimali was forced to think about her future. As she had always frequented the courts, she had been inspired to become a lawyer. But life doesn?t always go exactly as planned. She lost her will to become a lawyer. ?At the final court hearing, the lawyer valued my life to be Rs. 25,000. I was so taken aback. After years of suffering, the lawyer only valued my life to be Rs.25,000. So I didn?t want to be a lawyer thereafter. I took to media. Through a scholarship I went to India to follow journalism in mass media and returned to the island with a first class degree,?recalled Nimali.
Armed with a media qualification, Nimali aspires to be the most talented crime reporter in the country.? On a final note, Nimali stressed that she wanted to be the voice behind the children and make their plies heard.?? The effectiveness and positive impact of such programs were highlighted through Iresha Dilhani?s success story.? ?
Iresha is the proud owner of her own graphic design institute, named Print Forest. Her tale explains that when you set your mind on achieving your goals with sheer determination and will power, you will definitely get there.? ?
At the age of 2, Iresha came to the SOS Children?s Village. There she lived with her little SOS family that included a mother, 2 younger brothers, a big brother and a little sister. Iresha?s school life was dotted? with achievements and awards. Like everyone else Iresha too had a dream.? ?
?My dream was to be a graphic designer and own my own printing institute. Along with 2 fellow brothers from the SOS village, we printed a book titled ?Little One Short Stories. That was the first step I took towards achieving my dream. After having passed the O? Levels I didn?t want to do A? Levels. I wanted to reach my targets and move forward faster. Amidst disapproval, I came to Colombo where I attended my first class in the graphic designing diploma. I was awarded with a bronze medal in my higher diploma and today I am proud to be the owner of Print Forest, my own graphic design institute,? said Iresha, breaking in to tears of happiness.? ?
Iresha pointed out that unlike other children?s homes and places of alternative care, the SOS Villages didn?t just drop them into society. They were shifted to girls? home youth villages and boys? home youth villages. Here they entered an environment different from that of a family. ?We were gradually trained how to behave in society and how to face interviews. We were given opportunities to practice a lot. This was a great asset to us.
What I would like to suggest other homes is to implement similar programs and mechanisms which will help guide children to better adapt to the society,?opined Iresha.
Each of these life stories shared depict that one?s own fate can be changed by one?s actions, given there is enough will power. But no matter how hard a person strives to change his or her fate, they will always be held back by the demon named social stigmatization in the inexplicable world we live in. These negatives lead to the questioning of human decency. So it?s high time that these issues receive attention and solutions are provided so that the world can change for the better.? ?

Pakistan slams US blacklisting of Kashmir ?terror? group
	
?
ISLAMABAD AFP Aug17, 2017 ? - Pakistan on Thursday criticised the United States for blacklisting the Kashmiri separatist group Hizb-ul-Mujahideen as a terrorist organisation, calling the move ?unjustified?. ??
The State Department designation bans US citizens and residents from dealing with the group and any assets found to belong to it in areas under US jurisdiction will be frozen. ??
??We are disappointed with the US decision in view of the fact that Kashmir is an internationally recognised dispute with UN Security Council resolutions pending implementation for the last 70 years,? Nafees Zakariya, Pakistan?s foreign ministry spokesman, told reporters in the capital Islamabad. ??
The move was ?completely unjustified?, he said. ??
After Washington announced the decision on Wednesday, several hundred activists gathered in Muzaffarabad, capital of Pakistan-administered Kashmir, and chanted anti-US slogans. ??

Prez, PM or Justice Minister can?t intervene in judicial matters
	
Justice Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe, responding to remarks made by Deputy Minister Ajith P. Perera, said today that neither the President, Prime Minister nor the Justice Minister had powers to intervene in judicial matters.
He said the possibility of appointing a special court had been discussed in the Cabinet and added that the Attorney General had also given written advice to the government on the matter.
?We are acting on the advice of the Attorney General,? the minister said.
He said the government was given a mandate in January 2015 to ensure an independent judicial system in the country and added that independent commissions were set up under the 19th Amendment to the Constitution to uphold the independence of the judiciary under Yahapalanaya principles.
?The judiciary and the Attorney General?s department act as independent institutions today. The Attorney General?s Department has the complete independence to act on the reports given by the police on their investigations based on the principles accepted by the world,? he said.
Minister Rajapakshe said in a video posted on his Facebook that, according to the Constitution, the judiciary and the AG?s department were functioning on two basic principles such as equality before law and the accused is considered not guilty until he is convicted by a court of law.
The Minister said no one who had read the Constitution at least once would make allegations against him and added that if someone doing so was only exhibiting his ignorance before the world.
?We can do nothing than pity the people who make?such allegations. Some politicians who come before the media and television cameras try to show they are ?Mahoshadas? but the viewers know they are actually playing the role of ?Kewattayas?, he said.

Regulating that overwhelming feeling of fear and worry
	
Have you ever worried before sitting for a test or when faced with a problem at work? Or even before making an important decision? Well it?s very normal to feel anxious over an issue and everybody has experienced anxiety. However some of us experience anxiety disorders where the constant feeling of overwhelming worry and fear can be disabling. Speaking to the Health Capsule, Dr Udena Attygalle, Consultant Child and Adolescent Psychiatrist, Teaching Hospital Karapitiya, Galle explained that anxiety isn?t all bad, it can sometimes be a protective even an evolutionary function that keeps us away from danger. Dr. Attygalle further explained the difference between normal anxiety and a disorder and how we can regulate it and use it to our advantage. ?
?
?Definition?
While anxiety is a normal reaction to certain stressful situations, it becomes a ?disorder? when the anxiety is disabling. So while having worries about the future is normal ( and useful at times!) if these fears become so paralysing that you are unable to carry on with your day to day work for an extended period of time, it may fall within the category of an anxiety disorder. Thus, while some anxiety may even have a protective function e.g. fear of heights might protect you from taking unnecessary risks, when it is at the level of a disorder it will likely impede your day to day work, e.g. so distressed by fear of heights that you are unable to even to go to the upper floor of your own house. ?
Although this is a simplified way of looking at it, anxiety disorders have certain characteristics that your doctor will be able to identify. Of all the mental health conditions anxiety disorders are one of the more common conditions. When anxiety affects children, it may have adverse effects on other aspects of their development. Thus, a child who is anxious may have difficulties making friends, concentrating in class and learning to separate from their parents. These are invariably important for the future development of the child. ?
?
The types?
There are many types of anxiety disorders. Some of them are as follows. ??
Generalized anxiety disorder is where anxieties are many and not restricted to any particular environmental circumstances. ??
Social Phobia often start in adolescence and revolves around fears of be evaluated in social situations. ?
The Specific phobias are restricted to highly specific situations. Thus, the anxieties about heights, flying, closed spaces etc. would fall into this category. ?
Agoraphobia is the fear of being unable to escape from places such as open spaces or even crowds. When the condition is severe the affected ones can even be restricted to their homes, because of their fears of being outside and being unable to escape to a safe place. ?
In Panic Disorder the essential features are recurrent attacks of severe anxiety (panic) at which point those afflicted feel so fearful that they may even fear that they are going to die. While they are relatively symptom free between episodes they live with constant anticipatory anxieties about getting another episode. ?
While all the above disorders can happen in childhood and adolescence, agoraphobia is relatively rare in these age groups. However in children there can be other manifestations of anxiety such a as separation anxiety disorder that are specific to childhood. The key feature is excessive anxiety concerning separation from those they are attached to (usually parents). In this condition they may refuse to go to school, have difficulties falling asleep without the person they worry about. ??
?
The symptoms
To simplify things symptoms could be divided in to 3 categories- physical symptoms, cognitive symptoms and avoidance. The physical symptoms would include palpitations, breathlessness, sweating etc. The cognitive symptoms would include a sense of worry, and forebodings. Avoidance is characterised by avoiding the things that make them anxious. In children anxiety is mostly evident by avoidance, physical symptoms and in other behaviours. For example, a child who is anxious about school might avoid school, he might also manifest physical symptoms like stomach aches in the morning before school. ?
?
Treatment ?
This is usually a combination of medication, psychotherapy and environmental modifications. Medication too is an important option, but has to be used regularly as prescribed to gain maximum benefit. ?
The psychotherapy work usually involves thinking differently about issues and reducing the avoidance seen in anxiety. Especially in the case of children family intervention such as getting the parents to respond differently to their children may be important. In essence the goal is to give those afflicted the experience that they can manage the distress and anxiety and that they do not need to avoid it. ??
Environmental modification may be especially important in children. An example being a mother with a child with separation anxiety who makes arrangements so that she can spend more time with the child. Other examples include scheduling in activities that are pleasurable in to the daily routine of those with anxiety disorders. This is important as the anxieties can in a way take over and feel insurmountable. ??
?
Prevention?
It is probably impossible, and not really necessary to avoid anxieties completely. This is as anxieties have a protective function and some believe an evolutionary function in keeping us away from dangers e.g. we are scared and anxious of snakes, (even the non-venomous ones) ?
But it may be important to be able to understand, regulate and use our anxieties in a way that lead to positive outcomes. This is a part of what is described as emotional intelligence.?
Thus while a deadline can make you anxious, if you are able to regulated it and manage it in such a way that it?s not distressing but useful in getting the work done, then you would have been able to use the anxiety to gain something positive. This is a part of emotional intelligence. Yerkes Dodson?s curve describes the relationship between performance and the level of anxiety. So while we do need some anxiety to perform well too much anxiety impairs performance. It may be especially important for parents to keep this in mind and help their children and adolescent to regulate their anxieties so that it does not become unbearable. And also help them communicate to you if they do become unbearable, so that help can be arranged. ?
?It is also important that parents are able to contain their own anxieties when it comes to children and adolescents. This not only gives them a model on how to manage their own anxieties, but also gives them the confidence to come to their parents with their own worries (knowing that they will be able to handle it!).?

Saudi king orders reopening of Qatar border to pilgrims
	
?
RIYADH AFP Aug17, 2017 ?- Saudi Arabia on Thursday ordered the reopening of its border with Qatar to Muslim pilgrims, a move which Doha said was welcome but too little to heal relations between the feuding Gulf neighbours. Saudi King Salman authorised ?the entry of Qatari pilgrims to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia through Salwa border crossing to perform hajj, and to allow all Qatari nationals who wish to enter for hajj without electronic permits?, state news agency SPA announced. ??
He also ordered that private jets belonging to Saudi airlines be sent to Doha airport ?to bring all Qatari pilgrims at his expense?. ??
Qatar?s foreign minister welcomed the decision but lashed out at Riyadh?s ongoing ?politicisation? of religious freedoms. ??
??Regardless of the manner in which pilgrims from Qatar or living in Qatar were banned from the pilgrimage... the government of Qatar welcomes the decision and will respond positively,? Foreign Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al-Thani told a press conference in Stockholm.?

Thinking of a  heart attack?  Read this!
	
The heart is the organ which pumps oxygenated blood around our body. It also has an extraordinary oxygen-rich blood supply to its own muscles. This feature helps maintain an efficient pumping mechanism, necessary to provide the required degree of perfusion to vital organs in the body. ??
This blood supply can shut off due to several reasons and when it does the coronary blood vessels, supplying the heart, get obstructed or narrowed. The cardiac cells which get poorly perfused as a result will die due to the lack of an adequate oxygen supply. This is what is known as a heart attack; when the heart stops pumping temporarily until the adequate blood supply is restored. ??
According to the American Heart Association, the main etiology behind a heart attack includes the halting of blood supply to heart muscles due to a narrowed blood vessel which is referred to as Ischemic Heart Disease. ??
Atherosclerosis is the commonest cause for the obstruction of these coronary blood vessels. This takes place due to the development of plaques comprising cholesterol, fatty substances, calcium, fibrin and several other cellular metabolites inside the lumen of vessels. Coronary Artery Spasms are another pathophysiological mechanism by which coronary arteries get narrowed and hardened resulting in a poor oxygenated blood supply to cardiac muscles. ??
Some scientists also suggest that a heart attack isn?t merely an outcome of an obstruction of blood supply to the heart, but an imbalance between sympathetic and parasympathetic section of the central nervous system including the brain and the spinal cord. According to them, chronic stress is the reason behind major pathophysiology, which triggers a long term releasing of Adrenaline hormone. This happens due to the stimulation of sympathetic nervous system which overrules the compensatory mechanisms of parasympathetic section. This will eventually harm myocardial cells and result in their death, which causes a heart attack. ??
?
What exactly happens
The long term development of plaques due to various risk factors described above can gradually obstruct the coronary arteries resulting in a shortage of perfusion to the cardiac muscles. However, other remaining arteries could compensate this imbalance up to a certain extent as long as there remains a sufficient arterial system that?s unaffected . ??
Moreover, the plaque which has a solid, fibrous capsule covering it, can rupture. This can happen due to sudden triggering factors like stress which will expose the fatty substances resulting in an acute rush of platelets to the site. This can further enhance the blockage by the fibrin clot, formed. ??
When this scenario takes place, your heart will run out of oxygen rich blood, which acts as a signal to the brain. This results in several symptoms like sweating, increase heart rate, flushing etc. You will also start feeling weak and dizzy, depending on the degree of severity. Dying myocardial cells will trigger a chest pain which may radiate to shoulders, arms, jaw, neck and even to the abdominal area. Survivors from heart attacks describe this pain as a squeezing type of a pain which may last from minutes to hours. ??
If proper treatment isn?t given as early as possible, myocardial cells will die beyond repair and result in a weak heart. If the level of injury exceeds the level of tolerance, the heart will stop beating completely leading to a stoppage of blood supply to brain. This will bring death within 3-5 minutes. ??
However, even if proper and timely treatment is provided, already damaged tissues can?t be repaired. So you will never have the completely functioning heart as before. A patient who suffers a heart attack will need several life style modification and post-heart attack rehabilitation procedures, where he or she will be taught how to lead a healthy life. This procedure will help your heart function efficiently. ??
Reminding the fact that ?prevention is better than cure?, it?s always good to treat your body as if it?s the most valuable part you own and seek medical advice whenever minute changes are felt and observed.

What the markings on Upper Mars say
	
Human hand ? Trailblazer of Human Civilization ? Part 21
The signs which add strength to the Mount of Upper Mars singly and in combination are the Star, Triangle, Circle, Trident, Square, and the Single Vertical Line. The Cross, Island, Cross-bars, Dot, and the Grille show defects in the health and character of the subject.
Crosses in the plain of Mars point to a volatile temper.
The signs on the Mount of Lower Mars should be read as lines of influence inside the Life Line.
Signs found on the Mount of Upper Mars and what they signify:
?
?Several lines: Violent temper, lasciviousness, brutality in love, bronchitis
	?One line: Courage
	?Horizontal lines from percussion: Enemies
	?Crossed lines from the percussion or simply on the Mount: Bronchial troubles
	?A spot: A wound inflicted in a fight
	?A cross: Death in war
	?A star: An appointment to a high post in military
	?A square: Violent temper held in check
	?A circle: A very bad omen. Very often a wound in the eye
	?A triangle: Excellence in military tactics
	?A grille: Hemorrhage, danger of violent death or suicide Signs on the lower Mount of Mars What the signs signify for the Upper Mount generally hold good for the Lower Mount as well.
	?An ill-formed cross: Tendency to commit suicide
	?A star on a horizontal line: A misfortune or death
Martians or those with well-developed Upper and Lower Mounts of Mars are usually hot- tempered people. They are inclined to over-excite. They are prone to intestinal, throat and bronchial troubles, blood disorders, apoplexy, skin diseases, and inflammation of inner organs. They run the risk of getting killed in conflicts.
