Prasanna Ranatunga out?
	
A political move is underway to strip Western Provincial Council Chief Minister Prasanna Ranatunga of his post after his participation at the political rally conducted by a few parties to press former President Mahinda Rajapaksa to come back as the Prime Ministerial candidate at the next Parliamentary elections, the Daily Mirror learns.
It is learnt that attempts are being made to promote present Health Minister of the Provincial Council Ranjith Somawansa as the next Chief Minister.
According to political sources, a powerful minister of this government is behind this move.

Asked about it, Mr. Ranatunga said though he was unaware of such attempts, he was ready for any eventuality.
?I am ready for anything. But, I will remain with people,? he said.

Former Ministers Kumara Welgama and C.B. Ratnayake are among them.

Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said on Saturday that he was willing to take on former President Mahinda Rajapaksa as his rival candidate at the next General Elections.
Mr. Wickremesinghe told a public rally in Wennapuwa, that the government was willing to take up the no confidence motion against Minister John Amarathunga in Parliament next week and dissolve the House immediately if the motion was defeated.
He said those who want to bring the former President back to politics should then contest the election and win if they could.
The Prime Minister said President Maithiripala Sirisena would not allow the former President to lead UPFA at the next election.
In such a situation he questioned as to whether the group, who want to field former President as the Prime Ministerial candidate would contest under the wheel symbol.
He said the SLFP has already pledged to work with the UNP to fulfill the 100-day programme and then form a national government after the General Elections.
?All we want to do is to create a bright future for the people of this country,? he added.
Meanwhile, Mr. Wickremesinghe said neither he nor his family members would use power to gain wealth as they had their own businesses to fulfill any such aspirations.
