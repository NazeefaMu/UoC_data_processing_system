## Title: Big blow to Modi in state elections

Big blow to Modi in state elections
	
India's ruling party yesterday suffered stinging election defeats in three key states, in a big blow to Prime Minister Narendra Modi ahead of national polls in 2019.
The votes held earlier this month and in November were seen as a dry run for next year's vote when Modi will likely go head-to-head with Rahul Gandhi of the Congress party for a second term.
"We accept the people's mandate with humility," Modi said late yesterday on Twitter.
"We defeated the BJP today, we will defeat them in 2019 too," Indian media quoted Gandhi as saying. "Mr Modi sold a vision to the country five years ago. India had the patience to give them five years. But they have failed."
In both the central state of Chhattisgarh and Rajasthan in the west, the chief ministers from Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) conceded defeat, while in Madhya Pradesh Congress came out as the largest party with 114 seats. Congress's traditional ally BSP took 2 seats, pushing the alliance seat tally to 116 majority mark in the 230-seat state assembly.
In Chhattisgarh, ruled by the BJP for 15 years, initial results showed the BJP winning just 16 seats, down from 49 in the outgoing parliament, trailing Congress on 68 in the 90-seat state parliament.
Congress also trounced the BJP in Rajasthan, governed since 2013 by the BJP's Vasundhara Raje, an unpopular local princess, winning 99 seats ahead of the BJP on 73 -- 89 fewer than in the last election.
Television footage showed jubilant Congress workers bursting firecrackers and dancing at regional party offices in both states.
In neighbouring Madhya Pradesh the BJP also suffered from voter fatigue after 15 years in office, with Congress set to be two seats short of a majority and five ahead of the BJP.
In two other smaller states also releasing results yesterday, Telangana in the south and remote Mizoram in the northeast, regional parties looked to be leading.
In Telangana the ruling Telangana Rashtra Samithi won handsomely -- at the expense of Congress. Mizo National Front (MNF), a BJP ally, is all set to form govt in Mizoram as Congress loses its last bastion in North East. The MNF won 26 seats in the 40-member Assembly, a gain of 21 seats since 2013. The Congress managed to bag only five seats compared to 34 seats it won in the 2013 Assembly elections.
But it was Chhattisgarh, Rajasthan and Madyha Pradesh that mattered most for the Hindu nationalist BJP, which swept to power nationally under Modi in 2014.
They form part of the "Hindi Belt" or "Cow Belt" region of around 475 million people -- more than the United States, Canada and Mexico combined -- where the right-wing BJP has its core support base.
Currently the BJP rules 19 out of 29 Indian states either outright or in alliance with local parties. Congress rules just two states, including one in partnership.
But the latest results are a blow to the image of Modi as an invincible vote-winner, and puts the 68-year-old on the back foot months before he seeks a second term in office.
It also strengthen 48-year-old Gandhi -- scion of the Gandhi-Nehru dynasty -- with Congress having lost more than a dozen states to the BJP since Modi took office in 2014.
The Congress yesterday hailed its good showing in assembly polls in three Hindi heartland states and thanked people for choosing "love over hate".
"Democracy has won! Thank you India, you have chosen love over hate, peace over violence & truth over lies. This victory is yours," read a tweet on the party's official Twitter handle.
Analysts have linked the BJP's apparent dwindling support to growing rural distress and unemployment rates in the country. Nearly 55 percent of India's 1.25 billion population is directly or indirectly dependent on agriculture, and farmers form an important voting bloc for parties. (The Daily Star)

## Title: BRAZEN  SELFISHNESS ENACTED

BRAZEN  SELFISHNESS ENACTED
	
To view selfishness beyond the accepted norms, you need to be in Sri Lanka where anything goes, anything is acceptable as long as you are a politician and more so if you are a Member of Parliament. The lunacy that was enacted in the hallowed precincts of Parliament on November 14 and 16 could rightly tell its own story but perhaps the HONOURABLE MEMBERS were unconcerned that they owe an explanation to the general public who put them there. Explanation or otherwise, they were quite prepared to act the morons they are; leaving behind a matchless legacy that cannot be contained in a single volume, their selfish behaviour knew no bounds, not the norms of decency, the accepted norms of parliamentary behaviour, they knew no norms neither did they care about any. What mattered was who hit the hardest and who shouted the loudest. Culture -- never heard of it -- what are they leaving to history -- does anyone care?
Moral values on the decline
The selfishness of this country is not portrayed only in Parliament but all over, whether it is in homes, schools, on the roads, vehicles or anywhere! We live in a world of increasingly-decreasing moral values -- at home, children show no respect for parents, in school, it is the teachers who are at the receiving end of ?no respect,? on the road, there are people spitting, regardless of where they spit and sometimes even on whom they spit at, buses are eternally scrambling and driving recklessly, only to get to the next stop, the cacophony of their blaring horns goes on regardless of whether they are passing places of worship or hospitals; the roads are so overcrowded with vehicles, mostly luxury vehicles that are continuously hurrying to get in front of the vehicle ahead of them, with no respect to road rules; all of which stem from SELFISHNESS ? IT IS A CASE OF ?ME FIRST? ALWAYS! WE HAVE LUXURY VEHICLES BY THE SCORE, BUT WE ARE A POOR COUNTRY. THIS IS THE ONLY COUNTRY I KNOW OF THAT HAS NO RESPECT FOR AMBULANCES. WHAT IF THE PATIENT IN IT WAS ONE OF YOUR OWN, WOULDN?T YOU BE SCREAMING? WHY IS IT SO DIFFICULT THEN TO MAKE WAY FOR AN AMBULANCE? INNATE HUMAN KINDNESS IS LACKING! SELFISHNESS COMES FIRST,? LET AL L ELSE BE DAMNED!
A big-time business?
Government hospitals are another sordid showpiece of selfishness. Regardless of who got there first, if you can bulldoze your way past the queues, you get in first! Whether the patient ahead of you is seriously ill, it matters not, ONLY ME! PRIVATE HOSPITALS HAVE THEIR OWN BREED OF SELFISHNESS STEMMING FROM GREED. MORE OFTEN THAN NOT, REGARDLESS OF THE NUMBER YOU HAVE, IF YOU KNOW THE DOCTOR, OR MORE IMPORTANTLY THE NURSE, YOUR NUMBER CAN BE CALLED FIRST REGARDLESS OF ALL THE OTHER PATIENTS WAITING, EVEN SOME WHO HAVE COME FROM FARAWAY PLACES. THE ICING ON THE CAKE IS THAT NOW, YOU HAVE TO PAY EVEN TO SHOW YOUR REPORTS AND ONE DOCTOR CHARGES AS MUCH AS Rs.7,500 JUST TO PERUSE THE REPORTS OF THE TESTS HE HAS ORDERED! IT IS CRIMINAL, ESPECIALLY FOR POOR PEOPLE, WHO COME WITH SUCH HOPE OF BEING CURED AND HAVE TO DISH OUT SO MUCH MONEY -- WHAT A CRIME! SHOULDN?T THERE BE SOME LAWS AGAINST THIS BLACK-MARKETING, ESPECIALLY AGAINST THE POOR AND WHERE HEALTH IS CONCERNED??
Christmas: The spirit of giving
Dwelling on the subject of ?SELFISHNESS? since we are in the season of Christmas, the most beautiful time of the year, the world over, the time for GIVING for sharing, for thinking of and realising how many people there are who do not even know what Christmas is, WHO ARE EITHER TOO POOR OR TOO ILL TO EVEN THINK OF CHRISTMAS! This is where UNSELFISHNESS TRULY COMES INTO PLAY! An absolutely beautiful example of GIVING was sent to me a couple of days ago of a hospital in USA where the doctors, nurses and the staff of a children?s hospital had given a total surprise to their little inmates, not just by staging a sing-song but going from ward to ward, singing, playing instruments and giving out toys to every child, with smiles and cuddles; culminating in a beautiful nativity play! That is truly selfless giving, and what this wicked selfish world needs more of today ? SELFLESS GIVING! Could we even dare to hope that something as beautiful and as soul stirring as this will ever happen in our country?? ?
I don?t need to translate this because I am certain my readers can read the transformation on these two little faces. Such tremendous joy for such a small act of unselfishness!?
Avarice personified
Money and greed for money breed SELFISHNESS TO A LARGE EXTENT AND TO A POTENT DEGREE! I want to share something with you -- if someone were to offer you a million dollars, would you take it? Most people would say ?yes? absolutely because it would buy me a big house, a nice car, nice jewellery; it would give me freedom, it would buy me happiness. It doesn?t! When you take the money once, it is never enough, it is like a drug, it is never enough. You count your money because you want to feel valued, you buy materials because you want something to hold on to, but almost always it is never enough. What you must understand is your SELF-WORTH IS NOT ATTACHED TO YOUR NETT WORTH OR MATERIAL THINGS, YOU GOT IT ALL WRONG. Because what you are after, should not be money or material things, WE HUMANS NEED FULFILLMENT AND YOU FEEL FULFILLED ONLY WHEN YOU GIVE WITHOUT EXPECTING ANYTHING IN RETURN, WHEN YOU LISTEN TO FAMILY AND FRIENDS WITH AN OPEN HEART, WHEN YOU ARE GENEROUS WITH YOUR TIME, YOUR ENERGY, YOUR CARING, YOUR GIVING! YOU FEEL SO EMPTY WHEN YOU HAVE EVERYTHING AND NO ONE TO SHARE IT WITH. WHEN YOU LOOK BACK OVER THE LAST 30 YEARS OF YOUR LIFE AND REALISE YOU HAVE NOT DONE ANYTHING MEANINGFUL, YOU HAVE SPENT YOUR LIFE JUST CHASING MONEY, SO YOU WILL ALWAYS BE EMPTY. WHEN YOU PURSUE A PATH OF ALWAYS MAKING AN IMPACT, YOU WILL FEEL FULFILLED! I HOPE SOMEDAY YOU WILL FIND THAT JOY. WE ARE PART OF A LARGER COMMUNITY, A BIGGER WORLD, AND WE NEED TO MAKE OTHER PEOPLE HAPPY. TEMPORARY HAPPINESS COMES WHEN YOU PURSUE MONEY BUT TRUE FULFILLMENT COMES WHEN YOU PURSUE MEANING BECAUSE AT THE END OF THE DAY WE SHOULD USE THINGS AND LOVE PEOPLE. THE OPPOSITE NEVER WORKS!
Selfish bandyism?
Let?s take a look around us, why is our country in such chaos? Because of one man?s selfishness, one man?s base ingratitude, one man?s total inability to accept that what HE did was WRONG, totally and completely WRONG! For the first time in the history of our country, there is no government; there is only SELFISH BANDYISM without the slightest regard for JUSTICE, FOR THE RULING THAT CAME FROM THE SUPREME COURT, FOR WORLD OPINION, FOR THE COUNTRY. WE MUST INDEED HANG OUR HEADS IN SHAME, WE PUT HIM THERE, WE GAVE HIM THE POWER, HE GAVE US SHAME!!!?

## Title: ?Butterflies? continue their  fight for democracy

?Butterflies? continue their  fight for democracy
	
The Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Intersex and Queer (LGBTIQ) community has been frowned upon by the Asian culture as opposed to the West. Against such a backdrop, their fight for acceptance continues in Sri? Lanka. While they represent a considerable portion of the Sri Lankan population, they are still being subject to harassment, ridicule and ostracism with blessings from the patriarchal mindset instilled in its culture. But their never-give-up attitude has given them the courage to come out of the closet.?
Attempts to decriminalise homosexuality have miserably failed and it was at a time when the community was becoming active that the head of State decided to call the ousted prime minister a ?butterfly.? As it is a homophobic slur used to describe this community, the entire community took to the streets a few days after the president made this remark. Last Friday, a faction of this community once again took to the streets and protested the undemocratic moves taken by the president since October 26.?
Butterflies for democracy Going by the derogatory term used by the president to describe the community, the recently concluded protest attracted a crowd that supported the rights of LGBTIQ. The protesters held rainbow flags and boards with slogans such as ?My vote is not for sale? and ?Butterflies are voters too.? During the protest, a few participants spoke to us and here is what they had to say:?
Ethical political culture need of?the hour?? Kumudini Samuel
I think it is important that we stand for democracy. Within that context, we see it as embedding equality and non-discrimination. Today?s protest is by the LGBTIQ community and we want to say very clearly that this unconstitutional process of superseding Parliament and the executive?s actions have thrown the country into disarray. It is something we totally reject and we need to work towards an ethical political culture. We also condemn the kind of ridicule the president himself subjected the LGBTIQ community to. In the context of calling for an ethical political culture, we are also saying that those efforts must respect, project and fulfil the rights of the LGBTIQ community. In this political crisis, we stand with all those who call for the due process of democracy, for the reinstatement of democracy and for the constitutionality of all actions whether in Parliament, executive or judiciary. We are also calling for the separation of powers between the judiciary, executive and legislature. This is the only way we can ensure checks and balances?
?
Vital to protect democratic freedom? Sonali Gunasekara?
I participated in the protest because I wanted to support the LGBTIQ community and I think it?s very important to ensure that we have our democracy in place. If not, we will not be able to stand for the rights of the LGBTIQ community because once democracy has been curtailed, every part would be curtailed. We therefore need to protect the democratic freedom we already have?
?
?
Our votes shouldn?t be sold?? Francis Rajiv?
Our votes shouldn?t be sold and we need democracy to live in this country. There is a way the president could have appointed the prime minister, but what he did was totally unacceptable. That is why we are here today, to let our voices be heard and stand up for democracy
?
?
?
LGBTIQ community represents large chunk of voter base ? Rozanna Flamer Caldera?
This protest underscores the fact that democracy has been hijacked and the fact that it has been used to foster hate, homophobia and racism. It?s not simply about the president calling us butterflies in a derogatory manner, but the joint opposition too has been expressing similar sentiments in the past. But it is the head of State who made this remark, completely wiping out the right of democracy of every citizen to be treated equally in this country. So we are protesting the decline in democracy and the unavailability of equality throughout the history for the LGBTIQ community. We also want to show the president that we represent a large chunk of the voter base in Sri? Lanka. Try 20%, if you want us to vote for a just, democratic government you need to come to us and decriminalise homosexuality and bring us into the society as equal citizens?
LGBTIQ community deprived of fundamental rights ? Adil Suraj
I came here to fight for democracy. Democracy is very important to this community because we have been deprived of our fundamental rights. The LGBTIQ community has been ridiculed by the president himself, but this is a community that needs to be treated equally, similar to every other citizen in the country. Today, we witness that they have become stronger in voicing out their rights and calling for democracy, showing they are stronger together?

The country?s national security council met the other day with Number One in the chair.?
?
Security forces chiefs, Police chief and chief secretaries among others, are required to attend these meetings held on a regular basis.?
Prior to holding this meeting, Number One had told his secretary: ?Call all security chiefs for the meeting, but let not that chief set foot anywhere near the place when the council is meeting!?
The secretary was to learn soon that his boss was referring to a head of a department responsible for maintaining law and order among many other things. On seeking further instructions, the secretary was asked to invite to the council meeting two deputy level ones who could be relied on not to divulge the state security secrets.
So, for the first time in its history, the security council had met with two deputies of this key department representing their chief when the latter was available as large as life in his office.?

A total of 2,590 people were killed in 2,481 road accidents during the past eleven months, the National Council for Road Safety (NCRS) said.
NCRS Chairman Dr. Sisira Kodagoda said accidents involving motorbikes and the number of pedestrian deaths had increased drastically with 1,011 people getting killed in accidents involving motorbikes while 792 pedestrians were also killed.
?The increase of such accidents can be attributed to incorrect overtaking, high-speed driving and riding, failure to follow road signs and not adhering to road rules as a whole,? Dr. Kodagoda said.
According to the report, an average of eight persons are killed while nearly 20 become permanently disabled every day as a result of road accidents. (Chaturanga Samarawickrama)

Economic crisis: Bandula invites US Ambassador to meet CB Governor
	
MP Bandula Gunawardana yesterday?said the remarks made by US Ambassador Alaina Teplitz in Kandy on Sri Lanka?s economic crisis were erroneous and invited her to meet the Central Bank Governor to be enlightened about the country?s economic situation.
Addressing a news briefing, the MP said it appeared that certain elements had fed false information to the Ambassador on the economic situation in Sri Lanka.
?We appreciate the fact that the Ambassador took the time to pay her respects to the Tooth Relics at the Sri Dalada Maligawa in Kandy. However, the remarks she expressed to the media thereafter were erroneous. She said the current political impasse had resulted in the depreciation of the rupee, decreased arrival of tourists and had intensified the economic crisis. We would like to point out that all these issues took place during the time the administration of Ranil Wickremesinghe was in charge. When Mahinda Rajapaksa assumed duties as Prime Minister, the country was already in a crisis. We predicted that this would happen. It was just a matter of time,? he said.
He said even the ministers of the Wickremesinghe Government had admitted to the depreciation of rupee while promising that they would find solutions to the issue. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

EU offers to help May salvage Brexit deal
	
?
British Prime Minister Theresa May embarked Tuesday on a tour of European capitals in a last-minute bid to win Brexit concessions, but top EU officials said they could at best offer clarifications to help get the deal through Parliament.
May?s trip to The Hague, Berlin and Brussels comes on the heels of a decision to delay Tuesday?s planned vote in the British Parliament on the Brexit deal May had negotiated with Brussels, amid fears of a crushing defeat.
?We are very much concerned about the postponement of the vote,? French European Affairs Minister Nathalie Loiseau said. ?We have done a lot help the UK,? she added, noting that it was the only deal on the table.
At stake is the withdrawal agreement, which spells out the legal terms of Britain?s departure from the EU on March 29, 2019, as well as a joint political declaration outlining goals for the future relationship.
May hopes to secure assurances that Britain ?cannot be permanently trapped? in backstop provisions aimed at preventing the emergence of a border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland, said Martin Callanan, a minister of state in her Brexit department.

Executive, Legislature, Judiciary can?t resolve prevailing crisis: Dullas
	
While claiming that the Executive, the Legislature and the Judiciary can?t find a solution to the prevailing political impasse, UPFA MP Dullas Alahapperuma said it was only the people who could bring to an end this crisis by way of a General Election.
Addressing a news briefing, he said these three pillars of democracy had failed to end this crisis which had almost reached its climax.
?The prevailing political crisis has become worse and none of these three have been able to sort this out. The only option left is to go for a general election and let people elect their representatives,? MP Alahapperuma said.
?The UNP is saying that the solution to resolve this crisis is to have a presidential election. The presidential election won?t become an effective method whatsoever to end this political turmoil. It would only make it worse,? MP Alahapperuma added.
He further said that the Executive, the Legislature and the Judiciary comprise of 1, 225 and 335 members respectively whereas there are nearly 16 million people who have the franchise.
?Therefore, it is apparent that people should be given the opportunity by way of a general election to resolve this crisis by which the country can start a new political chapter,? he added.
Meanwhile, he said the Tamil National Alliance (TNA) had no moral rights to be in the Opposition in Parliament because they voted in favour of the motion of confidence presented in support of Ranil Wickremesinghe yesterday.
?The TNA should forgo their post in the Opposition if this Parliament is to continue any further,? he added. (Sheain Fernandopulle)

Forum in Jaffna calls for People-Centred Democracy
	
A forum on democracy held in memory of late Somesasunthary Krishnakumar, Senior Lecturer in History, University of Jaffna, was held at the Trimmer Hall in Jaffna on December 9.?Activists, students, academics, journalists, artists and others from different parts of the country including Akkaraipattu, Kilinochchi, Kandy and Colombo discussed the ongoing political crisis, its historical origins and what democracy would resemble in the future.
Participants agreed that the present crisis was not merely a confrontation among political leaders, parties and the three pillars of the state, namely the parliament, the executive and the judiciary. The discussion focused on what democracy in the country has been throughout its history, particularly for groups on the margins including minority communities, women, oppressed caste communities and workers. The systemic changes necessary to build a people-centred democracy were explored.
The forum expressed concerns that the current situation could lead to further polarisation among regions and Muslims, Tamils, Sinhalese and Up-Country Tamil communities
The forum expressed concerns that the current situation could lead to further polarisation among regions and Muslims, Tamils, Sinhalese and Up-Country Tamil communities. Many participants stressed the past failures of the Left and minority movements to come together to shift national politics in progressive directions. Some highlighted the need to curtail the autocratic character of the Executive Presidency and work towards greater devolution of power. Others called for linking economic problems and broader social justice issues facing the people with the rights of minorities.
When people are divided and unequally positioned, democracy is meaningless. Ensuring an end to caste, ethnic, gender and class oppression in everyday life is central to building a plural, equal, and just society. To democratise state power, people must participate in changing the system of rule and state structures. The forum called for similar discussions in other parts of the country.

From JR to MS:  Executive presidency and  abuse of power They ought to be held accountable even afte
	
In 1978, when the all-powerful executive presidency was introduced, LSSP stalwart N.M. Perera asked what would happen ?if the presidency goes to a mad man?? The manifest limits of due process and absence of checks and balances against the behaviour of the incumbent has raised that pertinent question once again. Sri Lanka has never addressed this constitutional lacuna in full. Tinkering of the Constitution has not helped either.?
J.R. Jayawardene, the first executive was not insane, but he was destructively opportunist. He drafted the 1978 Constitution to serve his personal and political ambitions and then tinkered it for 13 times. He was also an arrogant old man, full of ego (who was finally put in his place by young Rajiv Gandhi), a false god among a dozen other so-called national leaders.?
The executive presidential system was introduced as means to address urgent and unique problems of economic development that the third world countries are faced with. However, its track record as an enabler of economic development and JR?s oversized stature ought to be gauged in comparison to the latter?s contemporaries of the same ideological vein: Lee Kuan Yee, Mahathir Mohammed, Suharto, and even Augusto Pinochet, some were bloodier than others, but they all uplifted their countries through right leaning authoritarian model. JR is a none-entity in this equation.?
executive presidency introduced as means to address urgent/unique problems of economic development that third world countries are faced with
	JR did not clean up the mess he created, instead he handed over a burning nation to his successor, Premadasa
	MS a victim of his own prejudices against Ranil. Also, he seems to be a hostage of his self-interested political/legal advisers, the quality of whose advises beg the question of their true motives vis a vis the preZ
But he proved to be extra calamitous. His arrogant handling of State affairs created far- reaching political instability, and gave rise to two insurgencies in the North and the South. Effectively, mayhem he sawed killed more people per capita, than any of the right-wing leaders of his time. Pinochet looked like a convent nun.?
JR did not clean up the mess he created, instead he handed over a burning nation to his successor, R. Premadasa. Nor did he create prosperity. Economic growth was dismal 4 per cent, despite the low GDP base of the country at the time (Whereas Mr. Premadasa, during his short tenure, defeated a moronic insurgency and doubled down on economic development).?
The executive presidency easily fit into the political, electoral and social conditions of some countries, French model being often cited as a perfect constitutional arrangement. However, it did not work for Sri? Lanka. Here and in a good part of the third world countries, it created all-powerful, nepotistic, tyrants and despots.?
There are two main reasons for that. One is the institutional explanation; Sri? Lanka, say for instance, unlike France or America, lacked independent institutions that can moderate the behaviour of an all-powerful president. Conversely, powers of executive presidency have weakened the mandate of these institutions.?
The second is (a politically incorrect) an orientalist explanation: Leaders and people of this part of the world are inherently less principled, among other things, in constitutional governance. This is a product of their civilisational exercise. In these societies, electoral democracy did not necessarily promote rational choice. Rather, it emboldened the grassroots ugliness and provided it with a representation at the highest level of political offices. For instance, in India, 34 per cent of the MPs in Lower House are either convicted or facing criminal charges in courts, according to a study by Milan Vaishnav of Carnegie Endowment for Peace. Interestingly, according to the same study, politicians who are facing serious charges have more chance (18%) of winning his or her race, compared with a less rowdy rival (6%).?
Such grassroots conditions also foster contempt for constitutionalism. Politicians are betting on the grassroots? ignorance when they brazenly violate the Constitution and justify their action in a bout of populism. However, the current political crisis in Sri? Lankais different from the past. Old habits of political class die hard. The retrograde electorate that tolerated such old antics had not withered away. However, new laws have been enacted to lessen the absolutism of the executive presidency. That task was achieved, to a great degree, first by the 17th Amendment (much of which was annulled by the 18th Amendment) and then by the 19th Amendment, which set limits on the president?s power to dissolve Parliament, until the completion of fourand a half years of the House, and also set up independent commissions, depoliticising key organs of the government.?
Therefore, the current behaviour of the president is no longer supported by the Constitution. In contrast, it is unconstitutional. Mr. Sirisena, by repeatedly refusing to accept the verdict of three consecutive no-confidence motions, has violated the Constitution.?His bragging that he would not appoint Ranil Wickremesinghe as prime minister, even if the latter is ?supported by 220 Members of Parliament? smacks of contempt towards Constitution and constitutionalism. His open admission to , in an interview with Kelum Bandara, that Mahinda Rajapaksa could have won the support of 113 MPs, if he had enough money to cough up as bribes, borders a confession of complicity in bribery.?
Unlike J.R. Jayawardene, whose abuse of power of his office was justified in the text of the Constitution, Mr. Sirisena has no such constitutional grounds to find refugee. In that sense, the president has made himself liable for an impeachment.?
Under Article 38 of the Constitution, any Member of Parliament by a writing addressed to the Speaker, can give notice of a resolution alleging that the president is permanently incapable of discharging the functions of his office by reason of mental or physical infirmity or that the president has been guilty of??
(i) Intentional violation of the Constitution;?
(ii) Treason;?
(iii) Bribery;?
(iv) Misconduct or corruption involving the abuse of the powers of his office; or?
(v) Any offence under any law, involving moral turpitude and setting out full particulars of the allegation or allegations made and seeking an inquiry and report thereon by the Supreme Court.?
Such a resolution should be signed by a two-thirds majority or signed by more than half of the Members of Parliament and the Speaker be satisfied that such an allegation warrant inquiry and report by the Supreme Court.?
Impeachment of the president should then be passed by no less than a two-thirds majority in Parliament voting favour. Then, allegations contained in such a resolution are reported to the Supreme Court by the Speaker. After which the Supreme Court conducts a due inquiry into the allegations and informs its determination to the Speaker. Should the Supreme Court determine that the president is incapable of discharging the duties of his office or guilty of allegations outlined in the resolution, Parliament may, by a resolution passed by a two-thirds majority voting in favour, remove the president.?
However, exhaustive procedure aside, the practical question is about the numbers. The UNP is well short of a two-thirds majority to impeach the president.?However, there is another school of thought that it is only the president in person, and not his actions, that are immune from prosecution. In that sense, once he cease to be the president, Mr. Sirisena can be charged before the court of law for violating the Constitution.?
According to Article 35 of Constitution, (1) While any ?person holds office as President of the Republic of Sri Lanka, no civil or criminal proceedings shall be instituted or continued against the president in respect of anything done or omitted to be done by the president, either in his official or private capacity: Provided that nothing in this paragraph shall be read and construed as restricting the right of any person to make an application under Article 126 against the Attorney-General, in respect of anything done or omitted to be done by the president, in his official capacity?.?
Article 126 states that the Supreme Court shall have sole and exclusive jurisdiction to hear and determine any question relating to the infringement or imminent infringement by executive or administrative action of any fundamental right or language right declared and recognised by Chapter III or IV of the Constitution.?
The president?s earlier incline to rescind the gazette notification on dissolution of Parliament was attributed to these concerns. However, talks with the UNP broke down last week after the UNP insisted on Ranil Wickremesinghe as prime minister.?
Subsequently, the UNP withdrew a fourth no-confidence motion, which it had earlier agreed to table in Parliament, on the advice of the president. It expressed for the forth time, no confidence in the government of Mahinda Rajapaksa, and requested the president to appoint a new government. The UNP withdrew the motion after the collapse of the talks with Mr. Sirisena.?
Sirisena is a victim of his own prejudices against Ranil Wickremesinghe. Also, he seems to be a hostage of his self-interested political and legal advisers, the quality of whose advises beg the question of their true motives vis a vis the president.?
A good deal of Mr. Sirisena?s fate hangs on the two court rulings; the Supreme Court ruling on the dissolution of Parliament and Quo Warrento before the Appeal Court questioning the constitutional basis under which the purported government of Mahinda Rajapaksa and his Cabinet were appointed. Both courts have issued restraining orders against the dissolution of Parliament and the exercise of powers of the government by Mr. Rajapaksa and his ?Ministers.??
Both rulings are expected to be issued this week, before the court vacation begins on December 14.?
The president had said he would respect the court rulings. However, he has repeatedly gone back on his word since he himself triggered the current constitutional crisis five weeks ago.?The question of 20 million people is what would happen if the president ignores the court ruling. At the root of the current stalemate is his refusal to appoint Mr. Wickremesinghe as prime minister, despite the UNP and TNA, which collectively command 120 votes, have in writing expressed their support to the latter. Unless the Appeal? Court that hears the Quo Warranto restores Parliament that existed before October 26 -- whether it has a mandate to do so is open to legal interpretation -- it is unlikely that the current crisis would end, even if both court rulings are issued in favour of the petitioners.?
Maithripala Sirisena is exploiting this lacuna. He knows he is unlikely to be impeached immediately. He also knows that Constitution is bereft of means to hold a serving president accountable.?
However, if the Sri Lankan democracy is to set a deterrent against the abuse of power by the holders of high offices, the long-arm of justice should reach them even after retirement.?

He is in a sulk these days!
	
?
An elderly opposition high-up had long planned to enjoy a long vacation in the November -December period in London.?
?
In fact, he had planned a detailed itinerary which included visits to friends and a fund-raising programme and to cap it with a shopping spree.?
However, the political crisis that broke out unexpectedly had sent all his meticulously laid plans haywire and this has plunged the man into an ugly sulk these days, they say.?
Price of his prized buy is a secret!
The purohita of appochchi fame hailing from a distant district the other day paid an official visit to Austria.
A two-day seminar he attended over, he had headed for the neighbouring country, Switzerland instead of getting back home.?
After checking in to a five star- hotel in Switzerland, he had lost no time going around the Swiss wristwatch shops along with a friend.
It was, in fact, in a bid to realize a life-long cherished dream that he had gone on this shopping spree: to buy a Rolex wristwatch from a shop in the country of its origin!
So, he had at the end of the day bought the prized wristwatch. However, he has decided to keep its price a dead secret, they say.? ??
Selfies, only things remaining from their visits!
When tensions were rising and controversies were raging with no solution to the unprecedented political crisis in sight, the political party leaders of the Green-led alliance had arrived at the main secretariat for another round of talks the other day.
Once at the secretariat, the party leaders, pending the call to the roundtable, were enjoying a chit-chat, when the party leader hailing from Wilpattu area interposed:?
?Take it from me we have come here today too for talks destined to come to nothing. Let us in the meantime, do something that will last for a long time!?
?What is your idea?? the other leaders inquired.
?I?ll show it. Come this way?. Okay! Now stand in a row!?
Then the Vilpattu politico began taking selfies including them one by one.
Presently they were called in and they sat down to talks which ended in smoke!
Later, the Wilpattu politico addressed them: ?Didn?t I say it??? He continued: ?What remains from this visit today are only the selfies taken by me!?
What the Wilpattu politico said turned prophetic when later his photos hit big in social media!

He is in trouble due to inauspicious nakata!
	
?
A JO heavyweight recently visited a reputed astrologer for a consultation.
?
The politico asked the astrologer to explain why everything went against the former strongman from the moment he assumed the Number Two office in the country.
After studying some astrological data, the astrologer replied:?
?The current planetary line-up is quite in favour of your boss. But everything has gone awry because of the inauspicious time chosen for him to take up duties in the new office!?
As the politico looked on wide-eyed, the astrologer continued. ?That ?nakata? was inauspicious because Moon was in the 8th Bhava while Saturn in the 4th Bhava at that moment giving rise to the highly malefic combination called ?Kanthaka Shani Yoga?!? Therefore, the fault lies not in the person chosen for the high office but in the ?nakata? chosen for him to take up duties in the office!??

Hearing of petition against MR?s Premiership postponed
	
With regard to the Quo Warranto Writ petition filed by 122 MPs questioning the legitimacy of Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa and the Cabinet, the Court of Appeal today fixed the case for arguments on January 16, 2019.
The Court directed all respondents to file written objections by January 4 while the petitioners were directed to file their counter objections by January 11.
At the onset of the inquiry, the respondents moved a preliminary objection saying that they did not fully receive notices and the brief of the case, and that is a matter of non-compliance with the rules by the petitioners, therefore the entire application be dismissed.
However, Court of Appeal Justice P. Padman Surasena and Justice Arjuna Obeysekara overruling the objection observed that there could be several ways to comply with the rules in serving notices and brief to the respondents.
The Court also directed the Registrar to re-issue the notices and the brief of the case and the petitioners were also directed to take necessary steps to make the briefs available to the respondents through Court. (Shehan Chamika Silva)

NEW DELHI AFP Dec11, 2018-? ?India?s ruling party looked set to lose power in at least one of three traditional stronghold states releasing election results Tuesday, in a blow to Prime Minister Narendra Modi ahead of national polls in 2019.? ?
Early election results in the central state of Chhattisgarh indicated the main opposition Congress party of Rahul Gandhi would win 59 seats compared to just 11 for Modi?s Bharatiya Janata Party.? ?
The race looked closer in Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh, two other traditional strongholds of Modi?s BJP that were also counting votes following elections in the states this month and last.? ?
In central Madhya Pradesh, home to 73 million people, early results put the BJP neck-and-neck with Congress, as observers said it was too early to call the result either way.? ?
Similarly in the western desert state of Rajasthan -- ruled by the BJP?s Vasundhara Raje, a maharani or princess -- Modi?s party was predicted to win 74 seats compared to 97 for Congress.

International Construction Consortium Expands Condo Developemnt from Nilaveli to Galle.
	
2016 saw the birth of Oceanfront Condominiums, the brainchild of Mr. Harsha De Saram, Chairman and co-founder of International Construction Consortium (Pvt) Ltd. Upon witnessing the success of beachfront vacation condominiums in the coastal areas of Australia and Thailand, it was clear that this would soon become a very popular concept in Sri Lanka.?
Locked away for decades during the war, but now developing rapidly as undoubtedly the best beach in Sri Lanka, Nilaveli Beach was chosen for the first Oceanfront Condominiums development.?
With over 3 decades of experience constructing at the highest standards in Sri Lanka, ICC completed and handed over the 1st phase of condominiums to the owners in just 18 months. With the completion of the 2nd phase in June 2018, the 82 unit, Oceanfront Condominiums Nilaveli was proud to be the first beachfront vacation condominium to be completed in Sri Lanka.?
Oceanfront Condominiums also provides turn-key management of the customers' apartments by furnishing, advertising and renting right throughout the year. The recent east coast season saw occupancy rates exceed 90% during the peak months, exceeding all expectations and confirming the concept and the success of the project.
Building on the success of Nilaveli, ICC chose Galle, the largest city on the southern coast, and the center of beach tourism in Sri Lanka for the second development.? Enter through classically styledarchway, designed to celebrate the architecture of Galle, and step into the courtyard which features the secluded pool. Walk down to the beach or head into the apartment which features double height views of the ocean from the living rooms.

JVP not concerned of whoever appointed to Premiership: Anura
	
The Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) was not concerned about whoever was appointed to the premiership, as the JVP was well aware of what both Ranil Wickremesinghe and Mahinda Rajapaksa did as Prime Ministers, JVP Leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake said today.
He told parliament that the JVP did everything possible to defeat the political coup and said whoever becomes the Prime Minister was not relevant to them.
?If a new government is appointed, a New Prime Minister should also be appointed. But it is not relevant to us,? he said.
Mr. Dissanayake said they voted in favour of the No-Confidence motion brought against the then Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe on April 4 against his actions as the Prime Minister for three years and added that the same criticism they made against him was still valid.
He said even though the then government managed to secure its power in Parliament through numbers, it had lost confidence of the people and added that the government?s stability did not depend only on numbers.
?A situation conducive to President Sirisena?s political coup had been created in the country due to the people?s loss of confidence in the government. There had been a situation where the people were compelled to somewhat accept the coup. The government had been acting against the mandate obtained in January 2015,? he said.(Ajith Siriwardana and Yohan Perera)

UNP Leader Ranil Wickremesinghe today said that the majority of MPs backing him to become the Prime Minister once again was a further step towards defeating the constitutional coup of October 26 this year.
Mr. Wickremesinghe expressed this sentiment speaking in Parliament after a majority of members voted for him during the confidence vote.
?The decision made by Parliament today is another step towards defeating the constitutional coup of October 26 this year if I may use the words of the JVP Leader,? he said referring to a statement made by Chief Opposition Whip Anura Kumara Dissanayake that what is important is to defeat the constitutional coup of October 26, rather than allowing any individual to become the Prime Minister.
Mr. Wickremesinghe pledged to come up with a new development plan if he is allowed to form a government. ?We will come up with a new development plan and intend to give concessions to people gradually,? he said.
?There are things which we could not do when we were running the government and we will do it if we are allowed to form a government again,? he added.
Mr. Wickremesinghe also pledged to come up with a solution to the national issue which will be based on an indivisible and undivided country. ?We will also work towards increasing powers in provincial councils and towards abolishing the executive presidency,? he also said.
He finally thanked everyone who backed him and thanked Speaker Karu Jayasuriya as well for his role in safeguarding the rights of the legislative. (Yohan Perera and Ajith Siriwardana)

## Title: Mr. Executive, your office is bigger than yourself?
## Section: Opinion
## Date: 12 December 2018 12:00 am
Mr. Executive, your office is bigger than yourself?
	
?It is the mark of an educated mind to be able to entertain a thought without accepting it.??
~Aristotle?
When an electorate gets carried away with the candidate?s veneer of simplicity that concealed all the oozing that was rotting away within the presumed ?common man,? consequences are seldom concealed. When he couldn?t match his flowing rhetoric with actual accomplishments on and off the field of politics, his acquired purity fades into nightmarish shadows. When the Executive does not realise that the office he holds is bigger than the person, the scope and expanse of office shrinks -- and that happens only in the puny mind of the holder of office -- instead of the holder controlling the office, the office starts controlling the person, the holder.?
What was described above is no psychoanalysis of an ordinary man of yesteryear. It is not an unimportant examination of an unimportant man on the streets. It is the living tale of our current constitutional crisis. One cannot take a powerful organism such as a written Constitution of a country for a toy in the hands of a toddler; nor is it a tool in the hands of a sinister and under-equipped set of rulers. Crafty rulers in the past resorted to navigating affairs of government through various nefarious means. They violated the Constitution as if they were obsessed by the very existence of such a document. The Constitution of Sri Lanka is the very source of our law; it frames the legal and lawful structure within which all our citizens have to exercise their rights and privileges. The one who chooses to go beyond the precincts of that Constitution does it at his own peril. The law of the land, the Constitution through one of its three pillars, the judiciary, will pursue him or her whoever he or she be, how powerful or powerless, how rich or poor and regardless of the language he or she speaks or one?s ethnicity, and will punish him or her. That is what makes us Sri Lankans, civilized and an organised community of brothers and sisters.?
Gathering storms against violations of our Constitution are noticeable. The storms have enveloped the body-politic of the country and the social media seems to be passionately infatuated with a movement that is still at a juvenile stage. Every trishaw driver, every boutique owner, every junior and senior executive in the private sector, every government servant and every street vendor, barring some who would not desert the Rajapaksa clan are making their own moves, sometimes willy nilly to express their opinions and views via social media, the most popular media methodology of the twenty first century. The smart phone is the vehicle through which these numerous views and counter-views are being exchanged.?
In this age of ?smart and progressive? social evolution, the chief executive of the country needs to craft and adopt a sensible and strategic approach to any developing problem. A minor problem should not be allowed to grow into crisis proportions. A minor irritant could always develop into a crisis if one opts to deal with it on a retail or piecemeal basis instead of adopting a strategic methodology to resolve such minor irritants. The current constitutional crisis is the birth child of such a foolish and untoward series of mistakes and blunders in statecraft. As was enunciated in my previous column, one violation was committed in order to cover up a previous violation. The unending series of lies and violations of our Constitution began turning its unpleasant and murky cycle; what seemed as a violation in the beginning turned into unmistakable rape towards an uncontrollable orgy, until an independent judiciary intervened.?
When civility and political decorum gave way to unhinged behaviour on the part of the executive, a cascade of events began to flow; most hostile, uncivilized and shameless nature of our parliamentarians was exposed to the hilt. When the world at large was the audience, the television and smart phone screens screamed loudly and bared open the nudity and desperation of our lawmakers. The so-called guardians of our sacred machinery of governance were the very violators of that machinery.?
The two men, the executive and Mahinda Rajapaksa, who could have controlled the chilling behaviour of our lawmakers on November 15 and 16 observed their silence. Another unabashed chapter of the story of Sri Lanka?s progress towards a developed democracy was etched with chili powder and water.?
When a coalition government is formed, it is but inevitable that differences among its stakeholders, especially in the realm of policy and principles of governance, erupt every now and then. As and when such eruptions do occur, civilized leaders on either side of the differences usually get together and make genuine attempts to arrive at compromised positions without giving up the core principles of a working democracy. In such a potentially-dynamic political dialogue, gentlemen usually thrash out all differences within the accepted confines and make a deal (reach a compromise) in order to continue with a working formula in running a government. However, when one party, in this case the executive, makes a unilateral decision to fire the sitting prime minister and swears in a different one who does not enjoy a majority in the legislature, as prime minister, all that deal-making and compromises flow out of the window.?
October 26, 2018 is indeed a dark day in the country?s seventy years of post-Independence history. What followed, some gruesome events both inside and outside Parliament, bore unmistakable signatures of mis-governance. No country in the world would enjoy being placed on the brink of chaos and anarchy. Man has advanced over centuries of untold misery and hard struggle against his own self-inflicted sins and crimes and arrived at the twenty first century with remarkable achievements that would eclipse all his mistakes and misadventures. Pundit Nehru remarked in his ?The Discovery of India? thus: ?How amazing is this spirit of man! In spite of innumerable failings, man, throughout the ages, has sacrificed his life and all he held dear for an ideal, for truth, for faith, for country and honour. That ideal may change, but that capacity for self- sacrifice continues, and, because of that, much may be forgiven to man, and it is impossible to lose hope for him. In the midst of disaster, he has not lost his dignity or his faith in the values he cherished. Plaything of nature?s mighty forces, less than a speck of dust in this vast universe, he has hurled defiance at the elemental powers, and with his mind, cradle of revolution, sought to master them. Whatever gods there be, there is something godlike in man, as there is also something of the devil in him. The future is dark, uncertain. But we can see part of the way leading to it and can tread it with firm steps, remembering that nothing that can happen is likely to overcome the spirit of man which has survived so many perils; remembering also that life, for all its ills, has joy and beauty, and that we can always wander; if we know how to, in the enchanted woods of nature.?
One cannot take a powerful organism such as a written Constitution of a country for a toy in the hands of a toddler; nor is it a tool in the hands of a sinister and under-equipped set of rulers
With such polished diction and unlimited passion, Nehru described the ultimate summit a man could ascend. Being the closest neighbours and even closer than closest relatives of India, Sri Lankaand her leaders, could easily lend credence to these eloquent enunciations of the ?spirit of man.? That spirit seems to have evaded our political leaders. When one places oneself above the country, when one considers oneself more important than the basic principles and norms that define the very character of the people and nation that he or she leads, when one chooses to dwell in the dark and shadowy space of delusion and self-pity, the spirit of man seems a mirage receding one?s own eyes. Such tragedy has occurred in our midst today.?
One should never try to interpret the political differences in terms of western and local. When one tries to do that, the hidden argument of patriotic against unpatriotic emerges and that is the very argument that holds true in the unsophisticated and unscholarly minds of the majority. When a simple personality becomes a simpleton, all hell can break loose. A close examination of the facts before all of us today indicate that there is strong possibility of such an occurrence. Sentries of democracy have fled; the moats of defence been clogged up and the sturdy walls, the last line of defence of democracy against unilateral onslaught by those who lack education, scholarly aptitude and wise decision-making is absent.?
Discomfort and feeling of envy against those who could lend better and more informed judgment combine to make a leader dangerously close to implosion. We have not reached that uncomfortable and uncomplimentary state as yet. Controlling and navigating the State machinery is not a mean task. It requires immense aptitude and extraordinary patience and poise. It?s not too late to wish for such a sublime occurrence.?

Parties discuss feasibility of holding general election
	
Discussions are underway among political parties to approve a resolution in Parliament with two-thirds majority calling for its dissolution in case the Supreme Court holds that the dissolution violated the Constitution.
The government which took office on October 26 is considering the possibility of relinquishing office in the event the Supreme Court rules that the dissolution of Parliament by President Maithripala Sirisena is invalid.
Negotiations are underway among several political parties to submit a resolution in Parliament calling for a general election.
President Maithripala Sirisena and Speaker Karu Jayasuriya are known to held talks both formally and informally on how best to end the present stalemate. Some UPFA MPs have requested the President to declare a referendum to seek public opinion on holding a general election. (Kelum Bandara)

Publication on conserving Sinharaja launched
	
The Environmental Foundation (Guarantee) Limited (EFL) launched its book ?Review of the Southern Border of Sinharaja; Contemporary needs against conservation? on December 7 at The British Council, in Colombo 03.?
The book elaborates on a study conducted to assess the present status of Sinharaja, the shortcomings in conserving it and ongoing preservation measures including utilising Sustainable Forest Management as a means of addressing the underlying threats posed to the Southern border of Sinharaja.?
EFL Chairperson Dr. Eric Wickramanayake set the tone for the evening by presenting an informative outlook on the present degree of climate change and its relevance to Sri Lanka. By discussing scientific information and statistics, he emphasised the importance of forest conservation as a force against climate change; especially at a time when extreme weathering has manifested itself to be more frequent than ever in the form of severe storms, droughts, both too much and too little water etc.
The principal author Hafsa Hudha officially launched the book by revealing the inspiration, the process and the purpose behind the publication
He spoke on the local and international promises and pledges made at the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement and how most fell far short of success.?
He was unhesitant in stating that, ?Conflict, starvation, disease and death ? that?s the stark reality.? Furthermore, awareness was raised on how to combat this crisis and how forest conservation is imperative to this defence. He explained how by preserving our eco-systems; our forestry, we protect endemic species of flora and fauna, conserve water towers which sustain our water sources, support water sheds which facilitate water provision and in the long run, ensure our own survival and our country?s future.?
Dr. Wickramnayake assessed Sri Lanka being ranked second in the recent 2019 Global Climate Risk Index as a glimpse into the future.? ?It?s happening in Sri Lanka, It?s happening now,? he said with regard to the global process of climate degradation. Organisations like the World Bank and the United Nations who fund billions toward the cause understand the issue, he explained, but as locals we fail to see that even from a business and political perspective, funding nature preservation is a fruitful investment and that it only makes sense to ?protect what we already have.?
Having laid the context for the publication, Dr. Eric Wickramanayake referred to the contents of the book. Sinharaja, despite being a national and world wildlife heritage site is under rising legal threats, and in response the book examines its present conservation policies, laws and the gaps, to save Sri Lanka from these threats.
Representing the Department of Forest Conservation which played a role in providing data for the publication, Conservator General of Forests, Anura Sathurusinghe spoke on the actions taken and to be taken toward forest conservation.?
?Our effort is to increase the forest cover of this country from the existing 29.7% to 32% by 2030.??
He stated that the relevant authorities plan to utilise the grant given by the British Government through the World Bank to achieve these targets systematically from next year onwards.?
The principal author Hafsa Hudha then officially launched the book by revealing the inspiration, the process and the purpose behind it. She provided a chaptered summary of the publication and the essentiality of their cause. She concluded with the message, ?The care we cultivate into the universe will sprout to take care of us tomorrow.?
The final speaker of the day was Emeritus Prof. Savitri Gunatilleke of the University of Peradeniya. She provided fascinating insight regarding the indigenous species of plantation that have called the Sinharaja its home for long decades and how these have defined the lives of villagers settled at the borders of the forest. She expressed regret about the unfortunate loss of traditional knowledge regarding the Sinharaja among the locals. She added to the concern by explaining that ?the buffer zone should not only be a physical barrier to the core area of the forest, but also a zone where the indigenous knowledge of the locals can be conserved for posterity while bringing the utility species of the natural forest into cultivation.?
Organisations like the World Bank and the United Nations who fund billions toward the cause understand the issue
-Dr. Eric Wickramanayake
At the conclusion of the evening?s proceedings, the gathering was invited to purchase the book and support the local, or rather global cause the ELF was representing.?

?
Once at the secretariat, the party leaders, pending the call to the roundtable, were enjoying a chit-chat, when the party leader hailing from Vilpattu area interposed: ?Take it from me we have come here today too for talks destined to come to nothing. Let us in the meantime, do something that will last for a long time!?
?What is your idea?? the other leaders inquired.
?I?ll show it. Come this way?. Okay! Now stand in a row!?
Then the Vilpattu politico began taking selfies including them one by one.
Presently they were called in and they sat down to talks which ended in smoke!
Later, the Vilpattu politico addressed them: ?Didn?t I say it??? He continued: ?What remains from this visit today are only the selfies taken by me!?
What the Vilpattu politico said turned prophetic when later his photos hit big in social media!? ??

1st Army women?s symposium Identifying the value of women
	
Women,? an important segment of society, are believed to have the hands that rock the cradle, but are hardly given an opportunity to rule the world.? Although there have been women in governance and other positions, they don?t walk on an easy path with patriarchy pulling the strings. But gone are the dark ages when women were confined to the four walls of the house. Today, women are holding firm ground and making courageous attempts to do something that they have always excelled in. Established back in 1979, the members of the Sri Lanka Army Women?s Corps (SLAWC) has been rendering its services in a much closed frame. But recently, it took a bold step to come out of this frame and make a difference by engaging in making peace and working towards the reconciliation of post-war Sri Lanka. In this backdrop, the first ever Sri Lanka Army Women?s Symposium based on the theme ?Women : The Bedrock of Peace and Sustainable Development? successfully concluded. The symposium attracted various females in leadership positions who shared their experiences and lessons learnt in the peace building and reconciliation process.?
Established back in 1979, the members of the Sri Lanka Army Women?s Corps (SLAWC) has been rendering its services in a much closed frame. But recently, it took a bold step to come out of this frame and make a difference by engaging in making peace and working towards the reconciliation of post-war Sri Lanka
Women underrepresented in managerial, leadership and management positions : Army Commander
In his opening remarks, Lieutenant General Mahesh Senanayake, the Commander of the Sri Lanka Army said that women locally and globally have risen to greatness in different spheres such as nursing, management, defence, sports, space exploration and many other fields and are increasing their influence in the decision-making process. ?As the Commander of the Sri Lanka Army, initiating the Sri Lanka Women?s Army Symposium was a timely venture to further improve and empower women with a vision. The United Nations? Security Council Resolution 1325 has put forth the idea that women should be given greater access to leadership roles in peace and security and is aligned with sustainable development, gender equality and women empowerment. In Sri Lanka women are still underrepresented in managerial, leadership and management positions. The SLAWC was established with the preliminary aim of inducting women soldiers to the Army to carry out their duties. ?
One of the highlights of the event was the keynote address delivered by retired Supreme Court Justice Shiranee Tilakawardane who expressed her views on the topic of ?Women Waging Peace?. Excerpts of the speech are as follows :?
Conflict is a natural expression of social differences : Shiranee Tilakawardana?
?The greatest compliment women were paid over the years and ages was ?The hand that rocks the cradle rules the world? in a bedroom somewhere and ?behind every powerful man there?s a woman?,? Tilakawardana said in her opening remarks. ?These were the stereotypes of the dark ages. I too in 1979 was the first woman state counsel, sounds good on paper, but I know every barrier, stereotype and all the hurt you women have to undergo. I know the pain. We didn?t have human rights or women?s rights on the agenda in 1979. But thanks to movements such as Hashtag and MeToo, thanks to people who are recognising that men and women are equal and that everybody is equal before the law, they are bringing out the types of behaviour that are appropriate for all people. Therefore men and women, differently-abled people, the old, the young and everybody else can have equal human dignity and respect. People call me a trailblazer but do you front-liners know the difficulty about it? You can?t afford to fail because it?s a line of half the population standing behind you.??
She further said that within the next five years artificial intelligence would replace drones and that the strength of skills negotiation and humanity will have to be in place.?
?The Commander very correctly said that women have skills of gentleness and sensitivity. Of course we have those skills as you do. The stereotype is such that men wage war and today we can say that women wage peace. With that men and women will form a wonderful partnership. We talk of the fundamental document which is the UN/SC/1325 resolution which talks about women and security. This is the ?guru norm? that you have and it speaks of an important factor; which is, women inherently resolve conflict and are excellent at dispute resolution. ?
She also said that it is important to understand that conflict is not a negative force; rather it?s a natural expression of social differences. ?If managed non-violently, it could be positive and a source of immense creativity and purpose. The goal of prevention is to create situations in which differences and conflicts are addressed in a non-violent and constructive manner. The second security issue is disarmament, de-mobilisation and re-integration. Corruption is not a matter of money in this field, but it?s a matter of life. It is a matter of the future of this beloved nation. Everybody is talking about transitional governance and security. We need something more than armies and uniforms and these great structures of Parliaments and governance.??
The symposium also included elaborate discussions by esteemed panellists on various topics such as the role of women in decision making and sustainable peace, role of women in institutional leadership, military women as a source of energy for socio-economic development, women leadership in nation building and women leadership in foreign policy making.?

Thai junta lifts ban on political activities first time after coup
	
?
DPA, 11th DECEMBER, 2018- The ruling military government in Thailand on Tuesday lifted the ban on political activities put in place after it came into power in a 2014 coup to clear the way for elections in February next year.
In an announcement published on the Royal Gazette website, it said that all political activities except election campaigning can resume immediately. This means that, in principle, the public can now gather and organize political rallies. Previously, the junta had arrested and put several civilians under military detention for defying the ban on political assembly.
However, the lifted ban does not affect the cases against those defying the ban previously, the junta said. The junta?s announcement came the same day Thailand?s Election Commission announced that the much-delayed general election will very likely be held on February 24 as tentatively scheduled by the government.
?The Election Commission will hold the elections on February 24 according to the [junta?s] roadmap,? Deputy Election Commission Secretary-General Nat Laosisawakul told reporters.?

The Crow flies high with Kakiyan
	
Captain Elmo Jaywardena?s latest novel Kakiyan: The story of a Crow launched recently at the M D Gunasena Auditorium, amidst a large gathering of friends and well-wishers.
Kakiyanis Captain Jayawardena?s fourth novel following Sam?s Story, winner of the Gratiaen Prize (2001), The last Kingdom of Sinhalay, which won the State Literary Award (2005), and Rainbows in Braille ? shortlisted for the Singapore Literature Prize.?
With Kakiyan he brings the most-frowned upon bird, the crow, to the limelight as he paints the world through the eyes of a young crow, growing up with his family and neighbours in the Jacaranda Condominium. Through a collection of colourful crow characters like Roy Crow - the flying instructor and Victor Crow - the train lover, together with other animal friends such as Croco Martin and Tony Monkey, the book invites the reader to look at themselves in a different perspective. How does the animal world, and in this case, the world of crows ? those clever, observant birds that are ever present in our surroundings ? see the ?Great Ones?, us humans?
Speaking to those gathered, Captain Elmo himself called attention to the animal cruelty that takes place around us, which is sadly internalized to such an extent that it appears to be ?normal?. For him, the animal world was much more compassionate than the human world, where the helpless are looked after. He hoped that Kakiyan would in some way join the ranks of works that speak against animal cruelty. By using the common crow as the protagonist, he is also showing how close to home such issues are.?
The first copies were presented to Max Jayamanna and Prof. Yasmine Gooneratne. Captain Elmo then called upon a special person from the audience, who has been a constant figure in the local literary circles, not by writing his own novels, but by making hundreds of novels available to readers, most who have grown up borrowing books from him ? Deen the Bookman.?
Kakiyan has thus made its way to the bookshelves and has become one of the rare books that champions the crow.

The lad who set the paddy field ablaze?.
	
One of the truest tests of integrity is its blunt refusal to be compromised.
- Chinua Achebe
What cost Bill Clinton a second term in office was not his affair with Monica Levinsky , per se. It was his sworn deposition and the public affirmation by him that he had nothing to do with the latter, which later was proved and he admitted, as false. He admitted the affair and that it was wrong and apologised. Yet as the President he had lost the confidence of the public, not only those who voted him to power. President Clinton himself, in the eyes of the American citizen, had become persona non grata. A cardinal, grave and unforgivable wrong committed by the man holding the most powerful position of the most powerful nation in the world. No, it was not something about national security, espionage or financial integrity etc., the type of mortal sin, that you would associate with the downfall of a top politician but simply assuring the public, falsely , that he had no connection with a White House intern. So sensitive is the issue of public trust, which a Head of a State is held accountable to the populace.??
He simply opened the door for the wolves. He is simply a lad who would set fire to the entire paddy harvest when an old man smote him with a ?tokka? on the head
Now fast track to Sri Lanka and President Maithripala Sirisena. He was elected by 6.2 million people on January 8, 2015 and one thing that he reiterated, even tearfully, was that he was in danger of losing his life, along with those of his family, in the hands of the then incumbent President. Well, he got elected as President and even afterwards narrated the story as to how he spent the night of the election in a coconut estate, lights switched off for fear of life. And we took him seriously. It was the possibility of an assassination of the prospective President of the country and was serious.??
Revolution ?Moonlight?
October 26, 2018 was unprecedented in the history of Sri Lanka. Dr. Dayan Jayatillake equates it to the October Revolution. It is common knowledge now that he mixes political commentary with amusement. Yet in a serious note, that day not only marked the first instance where a President, openly and brazenly, engaged the Supreme Law of the land, in the breach, triggering a series of events, that led to absolute belittling of the dignity, credibility and confidence the citizenry were wont to see in their first citizen, their leader, the top executive of the Republic; making not only himself, but the entire country the laughing stock of the world.? ?
First he lamented of yet another assassination plot thus compelling him to remove the constitutionally elected PM and appoint the former President, who he had repeatedly accused of seeking to exterminate him, stating that in terms of the Constitutional provisions his appointee could muster the majority support of the Parliament, for which purpose he prorogued it. Then the assurance that he would not remain in office if Ranil Wickremesinghe commanded the majority support of Parliament. When it dawned on him that it was not the case ,the second breach of the constitution , a much more outrageous and brazen violation, by dissolving Parliament, and of course he didn?t resign.? ?
Then again he wanted the UNF to show the majority, assuring them he would accordingly bow down to the will of the Parliament. Parliament passed two ?No Confident Motions?, and two other motions that clearly showed , that MR did not have 113 votes in the House. Yet the President would not recognize the defeat of his pet government and appoint the MP who enjoyed the majority support and now swears that he would never appoint Ranil as PM even if all the 225 MPs were to support him. He is ready, he says again, if really pushed to the wall, to resign and go back to Polonnaruwa.??
?The tokka?
I do not hate our President. I feel sorry. I know the real danger, in terms of negating and reversing all the salutary and salvaging effects of a three and a half years of good governance, is not from him. He simply opened the door for the wolves. He is simply a lad who would set fire to the entire paddy harvest when an old man smote him with a ?tokka? on the head. As I have mentioned in an earlier article, President Sirisena, is not the only one whom the enchantment of Executive Presidency has bamboozled, but he surely is the one who had been overwhelmed to such an extent; to make him forget to stand still when the national anthem was played on public stage. The bewilderment runs that deep, fellas!??
Leave alone all the constitutional debacles and bad decision making culminating in this gridlock; what about straight-faced lying in relation to the ?six feet under ground? story insinuating that the former President and now his pet PM, wanted him assassinated?
Leave alone all the constitutional debacles and bad decision making culminating in this gridlock; what about straight-faced lying, in relation to the six feet under ground story insinuating that the former President and now his pet PM, wanted him assassinated. Media reported the President brushing off his statement given earlier as something uttered in the heat of electioneering and from the campaign stage, thus not to be taken seriously. Let me repeat that: the President says that the assassination attempts that he tearfully referred to were false statements. The President of the Republic has falsely and repeatedly claimed he was subject to assassination attempts by his predecessor whom he defeated and now, says that was all in a lighter vein.??
In a lighter vein
One would think that an alleged assassination attempt on the life of the Executive President, the head of the State would be something serious. At least , that is what I thought! Yet now it turns out that it was just part of the garrulous election speeches. The main informant whose words the President took so seriously, to the extent of removing the constitutionally elected PM, is now a nomination hopeful for the Lotus Bud political party run by the Rajapaksas. The political quicksands the President finds himself now in, does not seem to give way to terra firma as he would have expected. Now with the latest bombshell with his claim that it was due to the MPs raising the crossover money up to 500 million that MR was not able to win 113 in Parliament, it is clear now that our President has neither the honesty nor the mettle that is required to lead a nation.? ?
The damage caused by the October 26 moonlight putsch, is unfathomable politically, socially, economically and ethically. The country which kept representative democracy alive for nine decades, sometimes surpassing more advanced nations, now finds itself the laughing stock of the international community. As salutary as judicial boldness and integrity coupled with the bravery of those who dare to seek relief against dastardly crimes committed on the Constitutional sacredness, no decision of court is going to stabilize and get us back on track. The stab has pierced far deeper! It will take years if not decades to rectify the wrong committed on that moonlit night.? So , Ladies and Gentlemen, goes the story of the foolhardy lad who set fire to the family paddy harvest because an old man gave him a ?tokka?.??

TNA says its support was conditional
	
The Tamil National Alliance (TNA) said today that its support for the vote of confidence on United National Party (UNP) leader Ranil Wickremesinghe was conditional to the granting of power devolution to the north and the east, the release of political prisoners and the land.
TNA MP for Jaffna district Dharmalingam Sidaththan told Daily Mirror that his party extended conditional support for Mr. Wickremesinghe to get the required majority to become the Prime Minister.
Mr. Sidaththan said these were usual demands of the TNA right throughout.
?We asked for power devolution. It means the constitution making process should continue,? he said.
Also, he said there were lands to be released in the north.
?It is not only the lands held by the military but also the private lands earmarked by the archaeological authorities. Besides, there are private lands held by authorities as national parks. All land issues should be addressed,? he said.
He said the TNA put forward a condition that all development work in the north should be coordinated with his party.(Kelum Bandara)

The murder of two on-duty police constables- one from the South and one from the East- at Vavunativu, Batticaloa on November 30 sent shock waves through the country. Although a few arrests have been made, the motive of the shooting is still unknown because there are several dimensions which this incident could fall into. While the families of the slain PCs still mourn the loss of their loved ones, the investigators are also working hard to get to probe the incident in order to nab the?real assailants.

Brigade camps surrounding Vavunathivu police checkpoint
Vavunathivu, a town in Batticaloa District, is located about 5 km Southwest of Batticaloa or 15 km Northwest of Kokkadichcholai.??Vavunathivu was a strong LTTE-held territory and references have been made about the town in the history of the thirty-year armed conflict. The 1997 Vavunathivu Offensive was one of those main incidents associated with the war that concluded in 2009.? ?
The police checkpoint which came under attack is located one and half kilometres away from the Vavunathivu Police Station. The travelling distance between the? Sri Lanka Air Force (SLAF) camp in Batticaloa and the Vavunathivu checkpoint is about one kilometre. Another Special Task Force camp is located around three kilometers away from the scene of crime. The SLAF Vavunathivu detachment used to be right opposite the police checkpoint.??
Questions are raised as to whether the sand smugglers played any part in the police checkpoint incident or whether they were involved in the attack
Incident
Following orders from the top police officers, a special search operation was launched on November 29 at the checkpoint. There were four police constables who took part in the special search operation during day time. One of them had obtained approval to leave early to attend an alms giving ceremony.? ?
Another constable had left the checkpoint at 1 am on November 30. That constable said it was raining when he had left the checkpoint. It proves that the shooting had taken place after 1 am on November 30. Apart from the slain policemen and brutal attackers, no one had seen what happened after 1 am. The bodies of PCs Dinesh and Niroshan were discovered under suspicious circumstances around 6 am on November 30.?Niroshan Indika Prasanna (34) from Galle and Ganesh Dinesh (28) from Kalmunai were shot and killed by an organised and unidentified group?of assailants.? ?
Batticaloa Magistrate M.I.M Rizvi visited the scene. Police sources said that according to the postmortem, the two police constables were shot at close range. It was also revealed that Constables Niroshan and Dinesh had stab injuries. The body of one constables was found opposite the checkpoint, while the other was found on a bed inside the checkpoint.??The weapons used by the deceased police constables were also missing.??
Niroshan was married and was the father of a kindergarten kid. Dinesh was a bachelor. Niroshan had even worked in the Terrorist Investigation Division (TID). His next transfer to another police station was to be made in January.? ?
Dinesh had been earlier stationed in Trincomalee district. It was little under two months since Dinesh got a transfer to the Vavunathivu Police. He had made his last call to his sister on the night of November 29. He had told her that he would return home the next morning (November 30).??
Meanwhile Daily Mirror learnt that? it has been only three months since IP Nishantha Appuhami had started working as the OIC of Vavunathivu Police. Incidentally, IP Nishantha had taken a leave on November 29 to visit his previous police station in Galnewa for an official matter. When the shooting took place, the OIC of Vavunathivu Police was in Galnewa. One of the sub inspectors of the police stations was handling the duties of the OIC in his absence.? ?
A major police operation with the assistance of the CID is underway to find the killers. The CID has launched an investigation into the deaths. A special team- led by Police Chief Pujith Jayasundara, senior DIG of the CID and Police Spokesman- is still in Batticaloa to probe the killing. The motive behind the killing is still not known. Statements have been recorded from several persons, including the villagers in Vavunathivu.

Mahaveer celebrations
Maaveerar Naal is a remembrance day observed by Sri Lankan Tamils to remember the deaths of militants who fought for the LTTE. It is held each year on November 27; the date on which the first LTTE cadre, Lt. Shankar (Sathiyanathan alias Suresh), is said to have died in combat in 1982.??
Police said the largest Maaveerar celebrations took place this year in Kilinochchchi. Just like in other towns, preparations were being made to hold events in Vavunathivu too.? ?Police said there was an event to be held near the STF camp in Thandiyadi area. The STF camp was built on a land which used to be an LTTE burial site. The organisers had made preparations to hold the event on a larger scale this year by putting up huge stages and lighting massive oil lamps. The police were alerted about the event by November 26 and OIC IP Nishantha had instructed the organisers to cancel the event, giving a reason that there was no legal permission to conduct the event. However, if there is a link between this incident and the shooting, why the attackers waited for three more days to launch the attack, is a question that many in the area pose.? The CID team is currently trying to unearth if the shooting was an act?of revenge.?
??Arrests so far
Several persons, whose movements had been recorded on a CCTV camera, have also been questioned and released. Meanwhile, as the police ban on the Mahaveer event in Vavunathivu remains as the recent incident that could possibly have a link to the shooting, the police directed an inquiry into the organisers of the Mahaveer events, in Vavunathivu.? ?

Subsequently, two former LTTE members had been taken into custody over the killing of the policemen. The two suspects were identified as Kadiramathambi Iraja kumaran?(Kannan,40) and Rasanaygam Sarvananthan.??
Kannan was taken into custody in Batticaloa and Sarvananthan at Kilinochchi. Later Sarvananthan was brought to Batticaloa for questioning. He is a former leading intelligence operative of the LTTE. He had told the police that he was in Batticaloa for several weeks to organise a Mahaveer event. Sarvananthan was staying in Kannan?s house in Vavunathivu, Batticaloa. It was also revealed that Sarvananthan had come to Batticaloa several times to celebrate Mahaveer every year.??
Although reports said that one of the suspects had admitted that he was responsible for the killing, the CID has no strong evidence against the two suspects and therefore whether both of them were involved in the double murder is still unknown.?Meanwhile, UNP MP Ranjith Madduma Bandara pointed out that the incident in Batticoloa was serious in nature and demands a proper investigation, as such crimes did not take place during the past three and half years.??
If there is a link between Mahaveer and the shooting, why attackers waited for three more days to launch the attack, is a question
Sand smugglers and Vavunathivu Police
Illegal sand mining activities are taking place in Batticaloa and areas close to Vavunathivu. Dozens of trucks, on to which illegally excavated sand were being loaded on to, were seen in around the town when the writer visited Batticaloa.??
Last year, six Special Task Force (STF) officers were hospitalised and a 17-year-old youth drowned during a tense situation that erupted when the STF raided an illegal sand mine in Karadiyanaru, Batticaloa. It was reported that the STF personnel were attacked by angry villagers during the raid.??
Questions are raised as to whether the sand smugglers played any part in the police checkpoint incident or whether they were involved in the attack because the Vavunathivu Police was against the sand?mining racket.?
??
Lack of facilities at Vavunathivu checkpoint
The shooting is also a grim reminder of the dangers faced by law enforcement officers across the country. Officers are out there serving in extremely difficult circumstances and this shooting incident brings a whole new dimension to the very real dangers they are?exposed to.? ?
The police checkpoint which came under attack comprises a hut made of a tin-roof and a tin wall where it is obviously difficult for the policemen to stay during sweltering day time or during heavy rain. There were two plastic chairs, a table and a bed. There were no sanitary facilities set up in and around the checkpoint.? ?
The checkpoint, which is located at the end of Vavunathivu bridge, next to a small Bo tree and a statue of Gautama Buddha, has direct access from the sea. The attackers may have arrived in boats or used them during their escape after the attack. Boats are usually docked near the checkpoint. However, the checkpoint had no facilities or emergency technological equipment whatsoever.? ?
In both during emergencies and daily life alike, updated communications systems are vital during missions launched to saves lives and?protect property.? According to the Control Circular 14/2006 of Main Circular 1924/2006 issued by the IGP on 2006.07.04, the following equipment are compulsory for a police roadblock.??
Signage, lighting, movable wooden or iron barricades, search kits, gloves, fluorescent cones, search mirrors, communication tools, materials to lift vehicles, caltrops, necessary fire arms, tools used to search ammo, police kennels, digital machine used to check NICs and support from?Intelligence Service.??
For a developing country like Sri Lanka, it is difficult to provide all this equipment to every single police roadblock, especially to those located in remote areas. However, the Vavunathivu Police roadblock had not at least a quarter of the above list, most importantly communication tools. That is why the bodies of the slain officers were discovered only after another two policemen had reached the place.??
IGP responds to the shooting
Obviously everyone who joins in the law enforcement profession in the back of his or her mind knows that there is a possibility that one day something tragic could happen. Hence every one of them chooses the profession willingly. Emphasising on the faults and failures of the police, IGP Pujith Jayasundara issued two letters dated on December 03, 2018 regarding the Vavunathivu police murder.??The following texts are quoted from the two letters.??
?Although police constables are usually deployed by the HQIs/ OICs for checkpoints and roadblocks, it is clear that Circulars and instructions issued by the Police have not been adhered to.??
	It was observed that the Vavunathivu police checkpoint, which came under attack, is not a good condition for the police personnel to carry out their duties. The Divisional Heads and District Heads, HQIs and OICs are responsible for?that issue.?
	Divisional Heads and District Heads, HQIs and OICs have failed to deploy PCs to act during an?emergency situation.??
He also ordered all Divisional Heads of police to personally make observations on every permanent roadblock and uplift the working condition of the roadblocks, providing all the other facilities.?The IGP had directed Divisional Heads to submit comprehensive reports regarding the condition of the permanent roadblocks around the country.??
Dinesh always wanted to serve the country: suresh, Dinesh?s brother??
?He had called his sister on the night of November 29 and told her that he would return home the next morning. Instead of him, his corpse had been?brought home.??
He always dreamt of becoming a policeman and serving the country. Despite opposition from his family, he realised his dream. He was very good at sports, specially karate. I have another sister younger to Dinesh. He got his first appointment to Muttur. We are still shocked as to who killed our brother for what reason?.??
We want justice: sampath, niroshan?s brother
?He was a good father, brother, son and a good husband as well as a good pillar of the community. Being the eldest son of the family, he took care of us. He joined the Police in 2009. It has been one year and 11 months since he got posted to Vavunathivu. He was about to complete his compulsory service period. He couldn?t wait to return home in January. We demand to know who killed our brother. We have the confidence that the CID will find out what happened and bring the assailants to book?.
When the shooting took place, the OIC of Vavunathivu Police was in Galnewa
?
Motive of attackers may not necessarily be political: Governor of Eastern Province
?The Vavunathivu incident in which two policemen were attacked and killed at a centric point is just an isolated incident. This attack could be an act of retaliation by a group against disruptions made by the police against Mahaveer Day commemorations. Secondly, it could have been an attack carried out with the intention of obtaining the weapons of the two policemen. The third possibility is that this reaction is normal when considering the prevailing situation in the country where assailants have certain ulterior and disruptive motives.? ?
If it is the third possibility, the motive of the attackers may not necessarily be political. If so, what they wish is to see the country?s stability being undermined using these type of incidents. Whatever the political issues that the country is faced with should be confined to the establishment. These types of incidents are developments outside the establishment.? ?
However, the murders are currently being investigated by the highest authorities. We need the peaceful atmosphere which we are now enjoying. This should continued during a post conflict scenario. Peace, security and development for the people are the top most priorities that President Maithripala Sirisena has?
emphasised on.? ?
Even today, I handed over some military occupied lands back to the people under the directions of the President. As the military is carrying out their own assessments on the security conditions in respected areas, lands are returned to the people. It is a point in favour of normalcy being retained. This murder has not?shattered expectations.? ?
We believe in the police investigation process. Perpetrators will be caught and punished according to the law of the land. However, we must not get the wrong people arrested. First we must get to the bottom of the incident. Our police are fully capable of finding the leads to the investigations and those who are responsible for the murder. All through the recent years, we have not experienced anything like this in the Eastern Province. This type of isolated incidents could happen in any part of the country,? said Governor of Eastern Province Rohitha Bogollagama.
??
Vavunathivu has no record of unusual incidents in recent past: Military Spokesman
?We also probed the incident. In fact, there are many angles to the incident. Since investigations are continuing, it is still difficult for us to establish the truth. There haven?t been any unusual incidents reported in that area during the recent past. In terms of national security, these types of incidents do not make any impact on the broader subject like national security. Nevertheless, we are concerned as the Army.?Offenders must definitely be punished via an immediate investigation,? said Military Spokesman Brigadier?Sumith Atapattu.? ?
?.??
Flash back to violence against police??
The November 30 shooting in Vavunathivu, Batticaloa evoked memories of the massacre over 600 unarmed policemen stationed in the same district on June 11, 1990, which is considered the saddest day in the history of Sri Lanka Police.? ?
Other incidents of recent violence where police officers became victims include the abduction of two policemen in Kurunegala in 2004 and the subsequent murder of an officer. The two policemen who were on traffic duty were abducted by an unidentified group in a van, allegedly returning from?a robbery.? Another Police Constable attached to the Intelligence Unit of the Tangalle Police had been injured when unidentified gunmen opened fire at Kataragama in March this year.??
At a time when all Sri Lankans are enjoying peace due to the sacrifices made by law enforcement personnel, the shooting also took place amidst the continuing constitutional crisis in the country. Therefore, the incident could be interpreted in different ways. However, Sri Lanka doesn?t have a history of there being proper inquiries regarding slain policemen during brutal attacks. This incident, whatever the motive of the attackers, should be an eye-opener and a stark reminder of the dangers our law enforcement officers face every day while protecting and serving our communities.??

Yellow vest movement that made Macron say Mea Culpa
	
The strongest is never strong enough to be always the master, unless he transforms strength into right, and obedience into duty - Rousseau?
On Monday, French President Emmanuel Macron admitted to the nation that he had blundered. In the face of weeks long country-wide protests, Macron dubbed ?pro-rich? president, had little choice in the matter. An admission of his mistakes was the only way to salvage his presidency.? ?
The President, a former banker, agreed to increase wages by 100 Euros, cancel the proposed tax increase for low income pensioners, withdraw the move to tax overtime work and the employers were requested to make year- end bonus tax free. However still he continued to oppose to the protesters demand for a new tax on the rich on the basis that it would weaken their ability to create more jobs.? ?
Through the president attributed the issues that plagued the country, especially like the deterioration of the public administration in villages, to the failure of consecutive governments, he conceded ?I assume my share of the situation - I may have given you the feeling I have other concerns and priorities. I know some of you have been hurt by my words?.? ?We undoubtedly haven?t been able to provide a sufficiently fast and strong response for a year and-a-half?. I take my share of responsibility for this? President Macron admitted to his people.? ?
Macron dubbed ?pro-rich? president, had a little choice in the matter. An admission of his mistakes was the only way to salvage his presidency
Call it inexperience or arrogance the fact remains that the young President who will turn 41 on December 21 has remained detached from the common man ever since he took over office eighteen months ago. The ever widening gulf between Macron?s plans for the country and the aspirations of the masses and the president?s repeated refusal to listen to public grievances finally gave rise to a new protest movement - Mouvement des gilets jaunes or the Yellow Vests Movement.?
The drive which was started in the form of an online petition and later joined by Facebook calls for road blocks and other forms of protests against the President finally brought the country to a standstill. Among the slew of demands of the gilets jaunes, were an overhauling of the current tax system, a 40% pay hike and the upgrading of the state sector. It had long been argued that the standard of the public hospitals and schools, especially in the villages and suburban areas has been dropping drastically and Macron who came to power last year with so many promises hardly has addressed this issue.? ?
An opinion poll following the mass scale protests on December 1 has indicated that 81% of the public supported the gilet jaunes. Polls had also shown that about 80% of the French population today thinks that Macron is ?authoritarian? and 71% thinks he is ?arrogant?.? ?
The fact that the President Macron has insulated himself from the ordinary man is a fact that even his wife Brigitte Macron has admitted. ?Now, unfortunately, we are alone. That?s what living in the Elys?e Palace does to you: we can?t trust anyone but each other. We?re lonely together, but lonely nevertheless?I trust Emmanuel and Emmanuel trusts me. That?s all that matters,? she was quoted as saying recently. 65-year-old Brigitte Macron has reportedly advised the President?s staff to let the President know that he is too ?arrogant and snappy?.? ?
What the president?s aides and Brigitte Macron could not do the Yellow Vests Movement has done. Given its success chances are that many protest groups in the rest of Europe attempting to replicate its achievement.? ?
