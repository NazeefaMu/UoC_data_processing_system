A secret chamber for privacy!
	
A purohita in yahapalanaya hailing from the South is said to be maintaining a secret chamber in his official residence.
?
He is using this secret chamber for safe-keeping of his highly confidential correspondence and documents apart from a few personal effects such as reference books and stationery items. And he has allowed only his son the ?open sesame? to it, they say. ?The purohita had remained inside this secret chamber when a big party thrown by the family last week got underway. And when he made a late appearance at the party, a political high-up from the Western province who was among the guests had inquired from him where he was when the merry making was going on. The purohita had replied: ?I am writing a book these days. I wanted to jot down certain important things I suddenly remembered before they could fade from my memory.?

AG withdraws case against Basil
	
The Attorney General today withdrew the indictment filed in Colombo High Court against former Minister Basil Rajapaksa and former Director General of Divi Neguma Department Kithsiri Ranawake over the Rs. 29 million alleged misappropriation taken place in the printing and distribution of New Year almanacs using Divi Neguma funds.
Senior State Counsel Sudharshana de Silva appearing on behalf of the Attorney General informed court that due to a technical legal reason the indictments filed against the accused needed to be withdrawn.
According to the prosecution, when the indictment was served on the accused earlier, the Attorney General had not tendered the ?consent letter? with the indictments in court.
Senior State Counsel also said that the Attorney General would serve the indictments on the matter again in due course after correcting the technical legal fault.
Subsequently, Colombo High Court Judge Pathmini N. Ranawaka discharged former Minister Basil Rajapaksa and former Director General of Divi Neguma Department Kithsiri Ranawake over the case in which they were indicted on charges of misappropriation.
And consequently, all the orders given by the Court against accused pertaining to this particular case, including travel bans, now would be nullified. (Shehan Chamika Silva)

Amazon Go: Meet the World?s Most Advanced Shopping Technology
	
Amazon Go is a new kind of store with no checkout required that means you take the products you want, and go! No lines, no checkout. (No, seriously.)
Amazon created the world?s most advanced shopping technology so you never have to wait in line. They call this shopping technology as ?Just Walk Out Shopping? experience.
Consumers simply use the Amazon Go app to enter the store, take the products they want, and go! No checkout lines or anything.?
This checkout-free shopping experience is made possible by the same types of technologies used in self-driving cars: computer vision, sensor fusion, and deep learning.?
?Just Walk Out? technology automatically detects when products are taken from or returned to the shelves and keeps track of them in a virtual cart. When you?re done shopping, you can just leave the store. Shortly after, Amazon will charge your Amazon account and send you a receipt. That?s super neat.
Amazon unveiled a video about the new physical store that uses the Just Walk Out technology. The new shop will sell a mix of "grocery essentials" and ready-made meals. It is confirmed that the first store will be open in Seattle on early 2017, where Amazon is headquartered.

The container was registered to a businessman in Marawila and it was directly imported from Japan.
The suspect had not been arrested yet, but Customs revealed information as the importer of the container had hospitalized himself to prevent from being arrested.
Mr. Pathirana said if the container was released there would have been a loss of Rs. 15 million in Government revenue.

Don?t defend SLC employees from Deputy Speaker?s chair - Anura Kumara
	
The Chief Opposition Whip and Leader of the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) Anura Kumara Dissanayake yesterday asked Thilanga Sumathipala, the Deputy Speaker who also happens to be the President Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) not to use his parliamentary post to defend employees of SLC.? ?
The Chief Opposition whip said this when Sumathipala was trying to respond to allegations made by Minister Arjuna Ranatunga regarding some employees at SLC.? ?
?We have an issue with the way the deputy speaker is using the chair to answer the allegations,? Mr. Dissanayake said. ?He should respond to these allegations after sitting in the seat allocated for him among the MPs.?? ?
Mr. Ranatunga also objected to the Deputy Speaker when he tried to respond to these allegations.? ?
Minister Ranatunga questioned the appointment of Vrai Raymond as a media advisor of SLC.??
?This person was giving advice to take legal action against me during the SLC elections,? he said.? ?
Raymond was appointed as Manager - Corporate Communications of SLC in March this year, despite SLC already employing a Media Manager.? ?
He questioned the appointment of Godfrey Dabare as the legal advisor and the appointment of Priyantha Algama as an international cricket advisor.? ?
?It would have been better to have appointed either Mahela Jayawardene or Kumar Sangakkara,? Ranatunga said, referring to the latter post.? ?
Ranatunga, a former Sri Lankan cricket captain, also questioned the necessity of Cricket Aid, a charity arm of SLC.? ?
?There is no need for Cricket Aid, as this charity work can be carried out by SLC directly,? he said.? ?
Deputy Speaker Sumathipala, who responded said Cricket Aid was established just after the tsunami in 2004 .? ?
?We had to have an institution to deal with the aid we were receiving from abroad,? he said.? ?
He said a sum of US dollars 750,000 was collected from a benefit cricket match during the tsunami period while a sum of Rs 10 million was collected from a dinner held in UK recently.? ?
?We will convert Cricket Aid into a legally incorporated institution shortly by bringing it under Registration of Companies Act,? he said.? ?
Minister of Sports Dayasiri Jayasekara who intervened when the Deputy Speaker attempted to respond to Ranatunga?s query about SLC employees, said, ?Mr. Sumathipala should respond to allegations, as Minister Ranatunga holds media briefings saying he is trying to save sports.?? ?
?I thought I?ll leave it to the deputy speaker to respond to the allegations on SLC so that matters could be resolved in Parliament itself. I?m going to start an initiative called ?Save the Port?,? Jayasekera said on a lighter vein. (Yohan Perera)

If I were rich enough I would have built a hospital by myself: Mahela
	
Former Sri Lanka skipper Mahela Jayawardena, who trail blazed the entire 670km from Point Pedro in Jaffna down to Matara along with hundreds of other people to support establish a cancer treatment facility in Karapitiya, said in an interview with Daily Mirror that if he were rich enough to build a hospital by himself he would have definitely done that.
On October 2, a 28-day odyssey from Point Pedro in Jaffna down to Matara, covering the entire length of the country began to collect funds to establish a cancer treatment facility in Karapitiya.
Among the celebrities, who joined this venture was Mahela Jayawardena, the former Sri Lanka skipper who trail blazed the entire 670km along with hundreds of other people to support the venture. In a candid interview Jayawardena speaks of the journey and what motivated him to embark on a painful journey.
Q? Mahela?the 28-day journey from Point Pedro in Jaffna down to Southern Dondra Head near Matara was a remarkable effort by the organizers to fund a cancer treatment facility in Karapitiya. Walking 670 km in 28 days is no mean task and it certainly needs a big heart to do that. How did you motivate yourself to do this?
A? Well, I have always engaged in charity for the last 15 years and I felt that for me the best way to help society is by doing such things. For me politics is something that does not interest and I feel I can contribute a lot in this manner and in my own little way. Sure, I have control of what I am doing and at the same time I can be part of events through which I feel I can help people. And to be involved with good people like Nathan, Sarinda and every volunteer who was part of this and were fantastic people. I have learned a lot from them.
Q? Was it what happened to your brother that led you to take up this mission of walking nearly 670 km?
A? What happened to my brother 20 years ago did make a huge impact on my life and opened my eyes knowing what life is all about and what people go through, and for me to be involved in things that could help people. The satisfaction I get from that is immense and it is tough when you lose your loved ones. It is never the same. For me I lost a friend who I wished I had all these years. But that is life and for me it has given me a path to be a better person and a way to? help others. Yes, he definitely helped me to find that space.
Q How tough was the walk and how did your body take up the challenge?
A? Well, it was tougher than what I initially thought. I thought it was just walking and I could get through, but every day was a grind. There were pain barriers I had to go through not just me but everyone. Some did get injured and could not complete.
There were blisters, sore legs and swollen ankles. Mentally you get fatigued to go through the same routine everyday but it was a great experience and I would not exchange anything else in the world.
It was something special which we all enjoyed, whoever who walked and everyone who came and walked with us on a daily basis. Yes, the body took its toll but it was for a good cause.
Q How many kilos did you shed at the end of the journey?
A? I probably lost about three kilogrammes not more than that. But it was very healthy 28 days. I managed to stay on a strict diet and try and be very disciplined with what I did. It was very good for me to do that. Yes, the body took a huge beat but it was for a good course.
Q? Your wife was part of this journey right through and leaving your daughter at home and joining you in the journey was appreciated by everyone? How do you look at her contribution?
A? Yes. Christina was absolutely brilliant. She walked the entire distance and she was amazing with others as well, encouraging them, helping them and especially for me to have her alongside me really helped me to get through the 28 days. It was tough for us to leave our little daughter but we made sure when we could we had her around. And I think for her as well it was a great experience to be part of a group who was doing this walk. One day she will grow up knowing that we walked and were all part of something special. I think that?s what life is all about, the memories of things that you?ve done and that you could be satisfied with. Big thank you to my wife.
Q? I read a Facebook post saying ?rich cricketers? walk to collect money from poor people to build a hospital?. Even though there were hundreds of thousand people behind the project, some may have felt that way. How do you respond to such comments?
A? Well I can?t help everyone. If I were rich enough to build a hospital by myself I would have definitely done that. Unfortunately I am not that rich. But at the same time I did contribute not just by walking but by money and we gave an opportunity to each and every Sri Lankan to be a part of this project. I think there were a lot of Sri Lankans who have lost their loved ones and were affected by cancer and we gave them an opportunity to be part of something that would help them in their healing process. We tried to try and get people to see light at the end of the tunnel and to walk with them in that end. But unfortunately there were some, who did not want to come out of those caves and would like to stay in the dark. We cannot help each and everyone but we tried our best to help people see the light.
Q? Some celebrities use their fame and wealth to enter politics. But you seem to use your wealth and fame for charity. How do you describe this? How successful was the trail and when will the project be completed?
A? It was a very successful walk but it turned out to be something more than just walk. It became a symbol of unity. People came out of all ethnicities, castes, religions and backgrounds to help us. This shows how generous the Sri Lankan people are and how united they are.
Yes, we are planning to start construction in March hopefully and within two to three years we hope to complete the hospital and have those first patients coming. It is a challenge. We also hope to stick to our time lines and get it through. It was great a great event something that I really enjoyed. Thank you for every Sri Lankan, who participated in it.
Q? Do you hope to take up more such missions in future?
A? Yes, I would. If I can help Sri Lankans I would definitely do it. This was a walk that helped me heal as well. I want to thank Nathan and Sarinda for giving me that opportunity as well.
When you lose a loved one, it is tough to get through that. This walk did help me to get through that little bit, knowing what I did and also knowing that it did help lot of other Sri Lankans, who was part of the walk and who needed that healing.
I would definitely do it knowing that it would help someone else. (By Champika Fernando)

Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa also offered his condolences on the demise of Tamil Nadu Chief Minister J Jayalalithaa.
??Tamil Nadu Chief Minister J Jayalalithaa captured the hearts of India's Tamil community. My condolences to the family and people of Tamil Nadu? he tweeted.
Rajapaksa, during his presidency, invited Jayalalithaa to visit Sri Lanka to witness the post-war conditions.
Jayalalithaa had a checkered relationship with Sri Lanka.
While the Sinhala majority supported her strong anti-LTTE sentiments, they did not favour her for her pro-Tamil nationalist stance.
The Tamil minority in Sri Lanka favoured Jayalalithaa for her ability to bring pressure on New Delhi to nudge Sri Lankan political leadership to grant concessions to Tamils.
Jayalalithaa, hospitalised since September 22, suffered a cardiac arrest on Sunday and passed away late last night in Chennai

A flush of anger spread over her face as she read the letter and she tore it up and threw it into the waste paper basket by her side. ?He can?t ask me to give jobs to his people. Don?t come here carrying letters addressed to me again. Now get out!? she fumed at him.

This politico now thick in the party?s propaganda activities in the area is reportedly throwing parties for supporters where hard liquor flows like water.
