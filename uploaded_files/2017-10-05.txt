## Title: BoC, Peoples' Bank NSB officials tell PCol; Ravi told state banks to bid low

BoC, Peoples' Bank NSB officials tell PCol; Ravi told state banks to bid low
	
During startling evidence by eight witness from the three state banks (BoC, NSB and People?s Bank), before the PCoI it was revealed that former Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake had asked state banks to bid at lower rates at two bond auctions with the assurance that other bids at higher rates would not be accepted. However, on both occasions at those auctions the CBSL had accepted bids much more than the advertised amount and at much higher rates.
At the onset of the yesterday?s proceedings, the Commission summoned CEO and the General Manager of People?s Bank, Vasantha Kumar to testify before the Commission.
At this moment, Senior State Counsel (SSC) Shaida Barrie who led the evidence, played before the Commission one of the deleted phone conversations between Arjun Aloysius and PTL CEO Kasuna Palisena which took place in the morning of March 29, 2016.
On March 29, 2016 and March 31, 2016, the Central Bank of Sri Lanka had held two bond auctions to raise funds to the Government. The advertised amount at the March 29, 2016 auction was Rs. 40 billion and it had ultimately accepted Rs. 76 billion. The advertised amount of the March 31, 2016 auction was Rs. 25 billion and had accepted amount was Rs. 50 billion.
In this phone conversation, Aloysius was instructing his CEO Palisena on how to bid at the March 29, 2016 auction referring to vital information he received from different sources. This conversation took place during mid-morning on the March 29 auction day.
Aloysius in the conversation says that there was a ?state banks meeting? that had taken place closer to that day. According to what happened at that meeting, Aloysius tells Palisena the rates at which the state banks (NSB, BoC, and People?s Bank) would bid at the March 29, 2016 auction.
In the light of this ?state banks meeting? revealed in the phone conversation, General Manager of People?s Bank, Vasantha Kumar started testifying yesterday before the Commission about this particular meeting.
According to witness Mr. Kumar, there was a meeting called by the then Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake on March 28, 2016 around 3.30 p.m. (day before the first auction) at the Finance Ministry.
Mr. Ravi Karunanayake had summoned all the three state banks, National Savings Bank, Bank of Ceylon and People?s Bank to this meeting.
The witness said Minister Karunanayake, Mr. Paskaralingam, representatives (including Chairmen) of the state banks, officials from the Treasury and several CBSL officials were present at this meeting.
SSC Shaida Barrie: What did Ravi Karunanayake tell you at the meeting?
Witness: He was of the view that the interest rate was very high at that time. He said with the intention of stabilizing the economy of the country the state banks have to support to get the interest rate down. He asked us to bid at a lower interest rate at the forthcoming (March 29, 2016) auction.
SSC Shaida Barrie: Were you given exact yield rates at which you should bid?
W: We were given a range of yield rates to bid on four different ISINs (International Securities Identification Number)
Range of rates given by then Minister Ravi Karunanayake
9.5% - 12.5%
12.25% - 13.20%
12.85%- 13.45%
12.90% - 13.6%
SSC Shaida Barrie: Was this range below the market prevailing rates at that time?
W: Yes. These rates were lower than what was prevailing
SSC Shaida Barrie: Weren?t you concerned about this?
W: Even though we were concerned about this, as state banks we had to support to bring down the interest rate. But we observed that they should not accept rates higher than what was given to the state banks at the auction.
According to the witness, at the meeting, there was a discussion about a Rs. 40 billion fund requirement as advertised by the CBSL. The witness also said that there were several bonds about to mature on April 1, 2016 amounting Rs. 8 billion from the People?s Bank and the Minister wanted to re-invest them by bidding at the auction a volume of Rs, 8 billion.
The witness said that approximately Rs. 25 billion was agreed by all state banks to bid at the auction and according to the discussion reflected in the meeting the rest of the Rs. 15 billion would be covered from the captive sources (EPF, Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation)
SSC Shaida Barrie: Did you have any doubt when you left that meeting?
W: No. because Minister Ravi Karunanayake agreed that they would not accept bids at a higher rate than what was asked from the state banks at the auction.
However, the witness afterwards had communicated what was discussed at the meeting to the Treasury Operations Department of the People?s Bank and had asked them to call the CBSL Public Debt Department and verify with them that they would not accept bids at higher rates.
Accordingly an official at the Treasury Operations Department of the People?s Bank had called the Superintendent of PDD at that time Mr. Sarathchandra in the morning of March 29, 2016.
This phone conversation was played before the Commission. In this phone recording it was reflected that the People?s Bank official was seeking an assurance from Mr. Sarathchandra on the lower rates. Subsequently, Mr. Sarathchandra says that he would convey the message to the Tender Board.
When questioned, witness Mr. Kumar said that although there were occasions earlier where the Treasury had held discussions with the state banks to take the interest rate down, this was the first instance where state banks were directed to bid at a lower rate at the auctions by a Finance Minister.
However, after the March 29, 2016 auction it was revealed that the CBSL had accepted Rs. 76 billion from the bids received at the auction accepting yield rates much higher than what the state banks had placed at the auction. (The rates they were asked to bid at the meeting)
Second meeting on March 30, 2016
The witness also testified about another meeting which took place at the same venue (Finance Ministry) on March 30, 2016 (before the second auction day) chaired again by the then Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake with the state banks in the presence Mr. Paskaralingam, officials of the Treasury and the CBSL.
At this meeting two officials had represented the chairmen of BoC and the NSB.
The witness was of the view that he could not recall the exact officials who represented the CBSL at both March 28 and March 30 meetings.
According to the witness, Minister Ravi Karunanayake had again requested the state banks to bid at a lower rate at the forthcoming auction (March 31, 2016 auction).
The witness said that Mr. Karunanayake had given the precise rates and the volume (Rs. 7.5 billion each for the three state banks) at which the state banks should bid at the auction. In this auction the advertised amount was Rs. 25 billion and afterwards Rs. 50 billion had been accepted.
When he was questioned as to whether he raised concerns about the previous undertaking, the witness said ?I raised concern about what happened in the last occasion. But the Minister assured again that they would not be accepting higher rates at this auction (March 30). Anyway to get us profits, the interest had to come down after what happened at the March 29 auction, so we agreed to that.?
SSC Shaida Barrie: But what happened at the March 30, 2016 auction?
W: The CBSL had accepted bids at higher rates than what was given us to bid by Ravi Karunanayake at the second meeting.
He said that he also informed Mr. Paskaralingam about some of People?s Bank?s customers bids which were at a higher rate than what the People?s Bank had bid at mid-morning on March 31, 2016 auction day. According to the witness he had sent a text message to Mr. Paskaralingam reminding about this and not to accept bids at higher rate than what was asked to be done by the Minister. However Mr. Paskaralingam had not replied.
When questioned by Justice Prasanna Jayawardena, it was revealed that there were 100 basis point discrepancies in the actual accepted rates at the two auctions than the rates what the state banks were asked to bid by Ravi Karunanayake at the two meetings.
Justice Prasanna Jayawardena: Have you participated in similar meetings before?
W: Not with a Finance Minister
Justice Jayawardena: Was the interest rate high at that time?
W: Yes
J: So, could it be a desirable action to bring the interest rate down?
W: Yes
J: Did you expect that bids up to Rs. 77 billion would be accepted at higher rates at the first auction (March 29)?
W: No
J: You again bid at a lower rate at the March 31, 2016 auction after the second meeting with the former Minister on March 30, 2016.
W: We anyway needed to take the interest rate down because after the March 29, 2016 auction the higher interest rates were accepted.
J: Even after the March 30 auction your expectations were not met on both occasions, right?
W: Yes
ASG Dappula De Livera: After the March 29, 2016 meeting with Mr. Ravi Karunanayake, did you realize that his undertaking given to you was violated?
W: Yes
The witness also said that there was an immediate opportunity loss calculation to the Bank due to the acceptance of bids at higher rates at the March 29 and 31 auctions.
During the testimony, the witness also revealed that former Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake had telephoned him somewhere in May 2016 and asked to recruit a person named ?Haliyadda? to the Treasury Operations Department of the People?s Bank.
?Mr. Ravi Karunanayake asked me to take that person. I said there was no vacancy. He said to replace the lady who was working at that time. But I said it can?t be done because she was competent enough to work there?, said the witness.
However, the witness had interviewed the person called ?Haliyadda? with a CV which was brought by ?Haliyadda?, but did not recruit him.
The CV was available as evidence before the Commission and at this point Justice Prasanna Jayawardena in a sarcastic manner quipped: ?Some qualifications similar to what Saman Kumara (interdicted EPF dealer) has?.
2nd witness
Thereafter, Chairman of People?s Bank Mr. Hemasiri Fernando also testified before the Commission with regard to the incidents relating to the two meetings at the Finance Ministry.
He also described about the two meetings and confirmed that Mr. Ravi Karunanayake had asked the state banks to bid at a lower rate at auctions conducted on March 29 and 31on the undertaking that bids with higher rates would not be accepted. Nevertheless, at those auctions bids at higher rates had been accepted.
During his testimony, Mr. Fernando said that Deputy Governor P. Samarasiri was present at one of the meetings (March 28 and 30) held at the Finance Ministry.
However, Counsel Harsha Fernando who was appearing on behalf of Mr. Samarasiri contested the evidence and said that his client was not present at any such meeting.
?I do not have clear recollection. But I can remember that Mr. Samarasiri attended one of the meetings, because he was in front of me?, he said
3rd Witness
National Savings Bank?s Chairman Aswin de Silva also testified before the commission with regard to the ?state banks meeting? which took place on March 28 and 30, 2016.
He had attended the first state banks meeting (March 28) with his General Manager Mr. Dhammika Perera. According to his recollection, there were Dr. Samaratunge (Secretary to the Treasury) and Deputy Governor P. Samarasiri present at this meeting.
However, he had not attended the second meeting (March30) and said that he had no recollection about the second meeting.
Mr. Aswin de Silva too confirmed as to what happened at the first meeting. He also said that Mr. Ravi Karunanayake wanted the state banks to bid at lower rates at the forthcoming auction.
The Commission also questioned the witness about the appointment of CBSL dealer to the NSB (Naveen Anuradha). The witness said that he requested the CBSL Governor in a letter seeking a competent individual to the NSB dealing room as there was a requirement to broaden the trading activities. He said he never asked a particular individual to the post. According to the witness, Deputy Governor Ananda Silva had replied him saying that an individual had been sent.
When questioned about the recruitment (January, 2017) of the dealer named ?Karunamurti?, the witness said that he only ratified the recruitment decision of the Bank as the Chairman.
4th Witness
Consultant to the Treasury Operations Department of NSB, Mr. Lionel also testified before the Commission.
He testified that he did not attend the March 28 meeting but his General Manager Dhammika Perera conveyed the information as to what happened at the meeting. Then the second meeting he was present at the Finance Ministry representing the NSB on March 30 and confirmed that Mr. Ravi Karunanayake had told the state banks to bid at a lower rate providing the exact rates and volumes.
Describing the appointment of Naveen Anuradha to the NSB, the witness said that there was a requirement for a dealer to the NSB as they wanted to expand the trading activities. Naveen Anuradha had been appointed to the NSB on February 1, 2015.
The witness said that there was an experienced dealer called Abeysinghe who had been working at that time at the NSB, but Naveen Anuradha had been appointed directly as the Chief Dealer.
ASG De Livera: Did he give you any advice?
W: Yes he told me to inform him before I do deals.
ASG: What did you tell then?
W: I said I don?t care about you. I will do what I want. And I informed this immediately to the higher authority of the bank and told that I cannot work with him.
ASG: Then what happened.
W: My dealing capacity of Rs. 1 billion had been withdrawn and I could not deal thereafter.
ASG: What did he talk with you in the dealing room.
W: He had said that he (Naveen Anuradha) has relationships with Mr. Ravi Karunanayake.
When Justice Prasanna Jayawardena asked as to what Naveen Anuradha was doing in the dealing activities at the NSB, the witness said that Naveen Anuradha had increased the volume of trading with Perpetual Treasuries Ltd, Pan Asia Bank and Acuity Securities.
Justice Prasanna Jayawardena: Did those activities of Naveen Anuradha result in NSB gaining more profits compared to other times?
W: No the profits were the same.
5th witness
Bank of Ceylon Chairman (BoC), Roland Perera thereafter testified before the Commission.
He said that he attended the March 28, 2016 state banks meeting and did not attended the second meeting on March 30, but subsequently got to know about it.
He confirmed that the state banks were asked to bid at lower rates to bring down the interest rate.
The witness said that his understanding from the meeting was that higher rates would not be accepted at the auction.
He also said that he did not communicate what was discussed at the meeting to anybody as they were price sensitive information.
6th Witness
BOC Assistant General Manager, Shantha Kumara also testified before the Commission.
According to the witness, it was revealed that the information relating to what was discussed at the first meeting was communicated to the BoC dealing room on March 29th morning from the Chairman who participated at the March 28 meeting. By that time BoC had already placed their bids at a higher rate. However, thereafter, BoC had amended the bids replacing bids at lower rates.
The witness explained that there was an opportunity loss to the bank as these bids were not placed at the two auctions independently by the Bank.
7th Witness
BoC General Manager Mr. Gunasekara also testified before the Commission and confirmed that he had communicated the Chairman?s information to the other officials of the bank regarding the first meeting (March 28)
8th Witness
Retired Deputy General Manager of BoC, Mr. Jayasooriya also testifying confirmed that it was he who represented the chairman of BoC at the second state banks meeting held on March 30.
He again ascertained that on this second state bank meeting, the rates and volumes had been given to bid at the March 31 auction.
Justice Prasanna Jayawardena: The yield rates given to you were lower than market rates, right?
W: Yes
Justice Jayawardena: Does BoC normally engage in such action?
W: Not normally.
J: But you decided, why?
W: Because at that meeting there was an undertaking that higher rates would not be accepted at the auction. Mr. Vasantha Kumar also voiced his concerns about this at the second meeting that the undertaking given in the previous meeting had been violated. At that moment they said that it won?t happen on this occasion.
ASG Dappula De Livera: Who told you that?
W: The Minister
ASG: Who is the Minister?
W: Ravi Karunanayake
ASG: But what happened after the auction?
W: Higher rates had been accepted at the auction.
ASG: So, the undertaking given by the then Minister Ravi Karunanayake at the meeting had been violated, right?
W: Yes, that undertaking was violated.
It was also revealed that both the Commission and the Attorney Genral?s Department officials had officially and personally informed President?s Counsel Rienzy Arsekularatne, who was appearing for Mr. Ravi Karunanayake to attend yesterday?s proceedings, but there were no appearance marked for the former Minister at the Commission.
The Presidential Commission of Inquiry (PCoI) comprising Justice K.T. Chitrasiri (Chairman), Justice Prsanna Jayawardena and retired Deputy Auditor General Velupillai Kandasamy, will meet again at 10 am on Friday. (Shehan Chamika Silva) (Pix by Nisal Baduge)

CEYPETCO will not increase fuel prices: Arjuna
	
Petroleum Resources Development Minister Arjuna Ranatunga today said if the Indian Oil Company (IOC) unilaterally increases the prices of petroleum products, the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CEYPETCO) would sell oil at the current price even though it incurs losses.
Commenting on the reported decision by the IOC to increase oil prices, Minister Rnatunga said the government had no intention to increase oil prices in the domestic market.
?IOC officials discussed their decision to increase oil process with me but I requested them not to do so. I believe that this is not then time to place an added burden on the people by increasing oil process though global oil process are rising rapidly. The government is aware that if oil prices go up prices of all goods including essential commodities will also go up and the government does not want that to happen,? Minister Ranatunga stressed.
Minister Ranatunga added that he would take all steps under his command to run the CEYPETCO as a no-profit no-loss venture as the government does not intend to earn a profit from oil business by putting a burden on the people. But at the same time the CEYPETCO cannot be run as a loss making venture because losses incurred are heavy.
Minister Ranatunga said a price formula is a necessity to regulate oil process in line with the prices of the global oil market that would fluctuate domestic oil prices simultaneously giving the consumer losses as well as savings of money.
Minister Ranatunga lamented that CEYPETCO incurred heavy losses from kerosene and diesel as there was no price formula for the two products. (Sandun A Jayasekera)

Hitting on his girlfriend: Student gets help of thugs to punish fellow student
	
A student of a leading school in Colombo, studying for his Advanced Level Examination, who with the help of four outsiders beat up a fellow student, were taken into custody by the Narahenpita police on Tuesday (03)

When they were informed of the the police acted immediately and took the main culprit into custody along with the car and the three-wheelers they had arrived in. After questioning it was found that the car belonged to the main culprit's mother who had earlier served time for trafficking heroin. The rest of the attackers were subsequently arrested as well.
Investigations were being carried out on the instructions of Colombo- SSP Palitha Panamaldeniya and ASP Roshan Dias. (Srinath Prasanna Jayasuriya)

## Title: How awareness leads to inner peace

How awareness leads to inner peace
	
Be mindful! You may have heard this phrase innumerable times. This phrase is regularly used not only in Buddhist meditation sessions, but also in other domains and realms where everyone is engaged in some type of work such as at schools, work places (both the Government and private sector) and elsewhere in the globe.? ?
Most people believe that mindfulness or awareness is only related or associated with meditation. This is completely fallacious and misleading. Therefore, not only members of the general public, but those who hold a similar view and guide people have made a mess out of their lives.? ?
Mindfulness is the paramount ability in human beings to be fully present or be aware of where they are and what they?re doing and not overly react or be overwhelmed by what?s happening around us.? ?
Mindfulness means maintaining awareness of our thoughts, feelings, bodily sensations, acts what we engage in and the surrounding environment every moment.? ?
Mindfulness also involves acceptance, meaning that we pay attention to our thoughts and feelings without judging or believing in them. For instance don?t believe that there?s a ?right? or ?wrong? way to think or feel in a given moment. When we practice mindfulness our thoughts tune into what we?re observing in the present moment rather than dwelling in the past or dreaming about the future.? ?
Though it has its roots in Buddhist meditation, the secular practice of mindfulness entered the American mainstream in recent years. This was in part through the work of Jon Kabat-Zinn and his Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) programme, which he launched at the University of Massachusetts Medical School in 1979. Since that time, thousands of studies have documented the physical and mental health benefits of mindfulness in general and MBSR in particular, inspiring countless programmes to adapt the MBSR model for schools, prisons, hospitals, veterans centres and beyond.? ?
Mindfulness is the paramount ability in human beings to be fully present or be aware of where they are and what they?re doing and not overly react or be overwhelmed by what?s happening around us
Mindfulness is intensively pragmatic and tremendously productive. Even though it isn?t a physical exercise, one extremely and constantly must be conscious of the observation and reflection.? ?
Most people passionately concentrate on their goals and objectives only. They are pursuing material possessions and acquisitions along with superiority and eminence.This is obviously reasonable and rational from a worldly and secular context, but what I have learned is that those who pursue such goals have completely forgotten the purpose of life.? ?
Fathers, mothers, husbands, wives, sons, daughters, brothers, sisters, teachers, students, employers and employees (the list goes on) are responsible and liable to all individuals in their vicinity.? ?
This is because ultimately everyone seeks inner happiness and innermost peace, hence one should not disregard and neglect others.? ?
If one genuinely practices mindfulness he or she should never allow a? single impure thought to enter one?s own mind.? ?
Those who practice meditation and frequently observe their own thoughts never associate themselves with dangerous thoughts, which lead to agony and sorrow.? ?
Practicing mindfulness doesn?t mean that someone concentrates only on one?s own career or profession. It means one must be completely attentive and vigilant of one?s own thoughts in the present moment.? ?
While you pursue your goals or engage in tasks you must honestly look after your mental and physical health. The person, who wisely practices mindfulness, won?t disregard anyone. While one is concerned about his or her well-being and health, one should never forget others. People who practice mindfulness become selfless.? ?
Owners, executives, managers and directors indefatigably strive towards achieving innumerable digits where revenues and profits are concerned. This is indescribable insatiable desire. This mental virus has created a catastrophic network and complex in the globe today. Profit based multinational companies and private corporate sectors have driven their employees towards a dreadful state of mind.
Work load, limited time frame and unfathomable expectations are extremely perilous and grave factors affecting employees. Millions of people are experiencing mental agony and heartbreak. Only a few employers contemplate on their employees, but most of them are unkind and vicious.? ?
Lack of mindfulness will definitely lead you to a catastrophic conclusion. Unmindful and furious people have no inner peace at all even though they have material and academic accomplishments. Personally I have encountered such instances. I compassionately advise and encourage people to be mindful so that they can achieve inner happiness. This can be achieved through the uprooting of dangerous and unwholesome thoughts such as anger, jealousy and hatred.? ?
The human mind and the thoughts that it generates are amazing and complex. It is a difficult task to explain this complex thing. How does the mind work or operate? How do thoughts constantly and continuously change? However a person who practices mindfulness will ultimately understand the nature of the mind and achieve innermost happiness and peace.? ?
Once the Gautama Buddha said thus:
?Bhikkhus, I do not see even one other thing that changes so quickly as the mind. It is not easy to give a simile for how quickly the mind changes.?
If you are not mindful, you may be entangled in issues and be perplexed. Then anger arises in you. Often leaders, chiefs or superiors swiftly? victimize themselves and deeply suffer. Such ferocious people are never silent and never look inwardly. Such cruel people victimize and persecute other innocent people in their surroundings.This takes place everywhere in society.? ?
We need to start being mindful from childhood. All activities of one?s own life must be mindfully observed. Then one becomes capable to minimize one?s mistakes and will never permit negative thoughts to generate.??
The person who honestly practices mindfulness diligently trains and tames the mind. He or she compassionately encourages others to practice mindfulness because this person is fully aware of the wholesome outcome and benefit of this practice.? ?
Most Westerners have wholeheartedly embraced what the great master, the Buddha, inculcated twenty six centuries ago. They honestly and assiduously practice the Dhamma to have a meaningful and peaceful life. Now multitudes of people believe in and understand that the training and purification of the mind is very important and a prime factor as a human being.? ?
Lack of mindfulness will definitely lead you to a catastrophic conclusion. Unmindful and furious people have no inner peace at all even though they have material and academic accomplishments
Once the Gautama Buddha said, ?Bhikkhus, I do not see even one other thing that when undeveloped leads to such great harm as the mind. An undeveloped mind leads to great harm.?
?Bhikkhus. I do not see even one other thing that when developed leads to such great good as the mind. A developed mind leads to great good.?
The lack of training and practice will definitely lead to a catastrophic situation. Most people are mentally depressed and psychologically traumatized. Some of them are undergoing multifarious therapies and treatments to get rid of agony and tribulation. Unfortunately some innocent people are in the dark and are brutally detained in their own cells due to domestic violence and the atrocious acts of their own partners.? ?
?Volition is the Karma or Intention is the karma? the Buddha once said. No one can escape from the effects of action. Repercussions and? benefits of one?s action will follow a person like a shadow.? ?
Be mindful of your own thoughts. Don?t let them defile and contaminate your mind.? ?
Keep your mind always pure and unblemished. This will lead you to innermost peace and happiness.?

Malaria-like mosquito species in North
	
Health authorities in the North have focused immediate attention on a kind of mosquito identified as ?Anopheles Stephensi?- a primary mosquito vector of malaria in urban India- that has been spreading in the Mannar and Vavuniya areas.
A senior official of the Anti-Malaria Campaign said this kind of mosquito had been reported first from India but it was not found in Sri Lanka until recently.
A senior official of the Anti-Malaria Campaign said just as the Dengue mosquito, it was not possible to bring under control the spread of the ?Anopheles Stephensi? mosquito. He said the larvae of the mosquito were first found in a garden well in Pesalai in Mannar. However he said the public need not entertain any fear about a possible danger of the mosquito until it was established through the ongoing research.
Meanwhile, Deputy Director General of Health Dr. Sarath Amunugama said that any illness caused by that mosquito had not yet been reported, but immediate steps would be taken to prevent the spread of the mosquito.
?Any patient suffering from an ailment that could be attributed to this mosquito has not been reported and we need not have any fear about a danger. We have made arrangements to identify Malaria patients from other countries on arrival. If any patient among them was found to be suffering from a disorder caused by this mosquito we have to decide on the possibility of a danger,? Dr. Amunugama added. (Romesh Madushanka)

Sunil Ariyaratne and Nanda Malini: Away  from a musical sensibility
	
The trouble with vilifying revolutionists is that those who vilify them happen to be those who?d themselves think twice of sticking to a particular cause or ideal. Malinda Seneviratne never belonged to this crowd, which is why his pieces on Nanda Malini and Sunil Ariyaratne deserve more than a cursory comment.?
However, where Malinda is wrong and where those of us who think differently about these two musical sensibilities are not, is that humanity isn?t predicated on the act of reflecting on sorrow and oppression and exploitation; it?s not predicated on anything definitive, come to think of it. The ?larger humanity? he wrote of in his critique of Pawana comes out, if we are to take his criteria of aesthetic values, in the poetry of Sekera and much of the work of the lyricists who followed him, the early Ariyaratne included.? ?
The main dividing line between the Old Left (the Communist Party, the LSSP, the NSSP) and the New Left (the JVP) was the fact that the former were theoreticians and the latter were, for the most part, proactive agitators. (I am talking about the eighties.) Theoreticians tend to mumble and distort. They also tend to compromise. The splits between the Trotskyites and the Communists had been, naturally, ideological, but the split between the Old and the New was more potent, more emotive.? ?
Nanda Malini has that rare, enviable ability to convey both infatuation and irony through her voice, as I pointed out last week.?
Ariyaratne and Malini (were) identified with this split. They were no longer aesthetes composing the poetry of love. They had become direct, provocative, and at times raw pamphleteers. The reason why they hit so many people was simply that those people were tired of theoreticians and elites and compromisers. They wanted someone, anyone, to transform rebellion into poetry. That?s what Ariyaratne did.? ?
So by being direct, raw, and provocative, these two salvaged their political statements from the fogginess of the poetry their forbearers had dipped them in. Ranbanda Seneviratne compared the 1971 insurrectionists to the ula lena; Kularatne Ariyawansa compared the socially conscious protagonist of Sumitra Peries? Yahalu Yeheli, Mudithalatha, to a woman of many mothers (?Eka Mawakage Duwa?); Sekera affirmed the act of dying alone, and uncared for, frequently. Such lyrics are at best obscurantist to those who want them to be more naked. It?s that form of nakedness one comes across in Wordsworth?s early work, even when he reflected on it later on:? ?
Bliss was it in that dawn to be alive,? ?
But to be young was very heaven?Oh! times,? ?
In which the meagre, stale, forbidding ways,? ?
Of custom, law, and statute, took at once,? ?
The attraction of a country in romance,?I can identify strongly with Ariyaratne and Malini today because, like Wordsworth, they celebrated a country in romance (bloodied though it was), and because, unlike Wordsworth, they were not romantics when they chose to celebrate it. They knew what they were in for; their act of renouncing their earlier phase, in which they had celebrated different ?facts of life? (so to speak), was conscious, willed, confirmed.? ?
It?s not the kind of youthful exuberance which Wordsworth, Coleridge, Auden, Spender, and Day Lewis embraced, certainly not the kind of privileged status these men enjoyed even when they were writing against the same institutions which helped them lead their privileged lives. For that reason alone, I think, their later self-exile to India, brief though it was, was not, as Malinda implies, a choice two turncoats would have made, but an eventuality they had to force themselves into.? In one sense the critics are right, though: while she renounced her earlier avatar, which I suppose every artist does at some point in his or her life, Malini downright spurned it. Writing seven years ago, Dr. Ruwan Jayathunga noted the following:? ?
?... she was unable to give leadership and make her music a powerful social force that could be a strong voice for social justice, since she did not believe in what she sang. Her music was dependent on the people?s requests. When they appealed for nationalism, she fulfilled the request with songs like ?Me Sinhala Apage Ratai?. When the trend changed, she refused to perform it. When the trend was ?anti open economic system?, her music changed accordingly despite the fact that she enjoyed the benefits of the market economy selling her music albums.?
Malinda summed up that last point rather acerbically, seven years before the doctor:? ?
?During those ?I-can?t-sing-the-saundarya (aesthetic)? days, when she thundered revolution from the many ?Pawana? concerts, she sold the ?saundarya? cassettes of her previous avatar on the side. So much for integrity and revolutionary ethics.?
There are more avenues than one open to the turncoat, or the mellowed revolutionist: becoming a Wordsworth, who celebrated the jingoism and the impassivity he had repudiated in his younger days; or becoming a Blake, Milton, or Dylan, who persists with so much revolutionary rhetoric that he or she is considered a parvenu, an outsider, a quirk. Nanda Malini had refused to sing of nationalism. Now she was refusing to sing of revolution. The Pawana songs were recorded and released again, yes, but never with the kind of energetic fieriness she breathed into them the first time. As for Ariyaratne, he turned into a different sort of Wordsworth: the sort who celebrated a different kind of impassivity and inertia, which by the way is what makes for much of his lyrics in the nineties and the early 2000s. They had celebrated the otherness of radicalism. Now they were celebrating the otherness of themselves:? ?
And it?s a celebration not of themselves, but of their intertwined poetic sensibilities:? ?
That last song (?Obai Mage?) is a joyful rehash of the opening to the Pawana songs which compare the two of them to earlier, classical poets and their consorts, including, of course, Ranchagoda Lamaya (?Upasakamma?). Obviously, they couldn?t completely evade their political phase. The truth is that we couldn?t either:? ?
Nanda Malini has that rare, enviable ability to convey both infatuation and irony through her voice, as I pointed out last week. It?s that ability which keeps her from giving completely into anger, hate, or sorrow. She and Ariyaratne do criticise the clergy and the laity, but not with the kind of bitter cynicism that someone like, say, Sunil Perera, resorts to off air. The difference between the sarcasm in Perera?s contemporary work (?I Don?t Know Why?, ?Lankawe Ape Lankawe?) and that of Ariyaratne?s earlier work is that the latter is creatively AMBIVALENT about it: while he does condemn the clergy for their impassivity when encountering crooks and standing up for them, he also softens the blow by writing about the clergymen who did, in fact, stand up for what was right in an earlier, as cruel, but gentler era:? ?
Ariyaratne and Malini (were) identified with this split. They were no longer aesthetes composing the poetry of love. They had become direct, provocative, and at times raw pamphleteers
Coupled with Malini?s dexterity, Ariyaratne?s lyrics are so roundelay that they don?t mean what we think they do. That?s his single greatest achievement, one which takes us back to our rich poetic tradition of double entendres and metaphors and deliberate confusions of identity and ideology. Decades earlier, Sekera and Amaradeva resorted to this same tradition in their most vibrant work before they gave into more mundane themes. It?s that tradition which crops up in ?Etha Gaw Ganan Durin?, which is less a celebration and more a satire of the fashion and the chic-ness the city inspires:? ?
Except that Ariyaratne doesn?t just satirise, he downright stabs:? ?
Much of Ariyaratne?s work after the nineties gives into this directness, but there was a part to him that refused to leave the indirectness, the ambivalence, of his early phase: the phase that gave us Sathyaye Geethaya, not Pawana. It?s a wholly provocative phase that greets us here, though provocative in a different sense: less political, more suggestive, by which I mean bordering on scatological, youthful silliness:? ?
One need not, of course, be a poet to identify what (or who) exactly Ariyaratne was writing about in ?Gata Gata Awidin?, or to identify what he wrote about in ?Nona?:? ?
The silliness, which these lyrics inspire, is never justified, never rationalised, a point that I think adds to their youthful sense of frivolity. They set off rather lewd speculations, which the lyricist doesn?t rationalise either. In these post-Pawana songs the melody, moreover, is as playful, suggestive, and silly as the words. (Most of them were composed by their Pawana collaborator, Rohana Weerasinghe.)? ?
Sunil Ariyaratne and Nanda Malini took us towards a new musical sensibility in the seventies and the eighties. With their new work, however, which sometimes brings them together and sometimes is worked on separately, the lyricist and the vocalist try to reconcile themselves to the creative indirectness that had inspired their earliest songs, ?Sukiri Batillange Geethaya? and ?Sakura Mal Pipila? included.? ?
Decades later, having caved into a more political conception of their medium, and having had to flee, they tried, to varying degrees of success, to fit into what they had once been. They couldn?t be political, because that would have invited more censure. Instead they resorted to youthful silliness, turning at least briefly into their younger selves. They had embraced the radical; now they were embracing themselves. They had celebrated the political; now they were celebrating the aesthetic. They had turned into a new musical sensibility; now they were turning away from it. They still are.? ?

White elephant national carrier pays thumping salaries
	
There are 190 employees of the national carrier Srilankan who draw a salary of more than Rupees one million while four top level mangers draw a salary of Rs. four million each, Janatha Vimukthi Peramauna (JVP) MP and Chairman of Parliamentary Committee on Public Accounts (COPE) Chairman Sunil Handunetti said yesterday.
Mr Handunetti told a media briefing that the national carrier cannot survive any longer. ?COPE at times advices the state enterprises on how they could be turned into profit making ventures but it is unable to think of any advice for the national carrier,? Mr Handunetti said.
He said the national carrier had greatly contributed to the country?s overall economic crisis.
?A sum of Rs. 16 billion has already been paid for the company from which the national carrier was to purchase eight new aircraft, as compensation for the cancellation of the order. Air Bus company was to start manufacturing four more aircrafts for the Srilankan airlines this month. The planes are to be purchased in 2020. We questioned Srilankan whether they intends purchasing these planes. The management said there is no intention of purchasing new aircrafts. If it is so the manufacturing has to be stopped. It is obvious that the government has to inform the manufacturers that it no longer requires the planes,? the MP said
?Srilankn has survived last two years by borrowing $ 400 million from Bank of Ceylon and Peoples Bank. A sum of dollars 400 million has been given to this money- eating monster. The national carrier has suffered losses amounting to Rs. 26 billion despite pumping of this fund? he added.
COPE chief said the decision to purchase eight aircraft was made without a Cabinet approval in 2013. No Cabinet approval was given to pay Rs. 16 billion as compensation for the cancellation of the order either.
?It is the white collar criminals who have led the country towards these economic scandals. The losses have to be recovered from those who destroyed the airline in the past and from those who are destroying it in the present time? he said in this regard.
Coming up with more disclosures the COPE chief said flights to some destinations had been stopped. However Melbourne flight was operating as the Srilankan Airlines CEO visited his family frequently.
?People will be able to see for themselves whether it is the Srilankan, the expressways scandal or the bond issue is the biggest fraud in the country when the Auditor General?s report comes in shortly,? he said. (Yohan Perera)
