Are they up to a double game
	

Two senior purohitas of late have begun giving lessons on How to run a government both in public and in private and several members in yahapalanaya have complained to the two leaders at the top about the peculiar conduct of the two purohitas, they say.

These two senior purohitas hail from the same district and one of them is well known as a ladies man. Both of them held high office in the previous administration too and were then staunch loyalists of the former strongman.
It is no secret that the two purohitas later switched their allegiance to the Compassionate One in anticipation of places in the top team in yahapalanaya as well.
Some sections in the Betel leaf party suspect that the twosome are up to some double game.

Batticaloa Airport now under the CAA
	
The operations and maintenance of the Batticaloa Airport has been vested with the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) from May 31, 2016, the Ministry of Transport and Civil Aviation said in a gazette notification.
It was earlier under the purview of the Air Force

Arrangements have been made to begin flight operations to and from Batticaloa from January next year.

Death threats against Ven. Gnanasara Thera / PHU wants Asath Sally arrested
	
The Pivithuru Hela Urumaya (PHU) today said Former Central Provincial Azath Sally, who was video taped allegedly threatening to assassinate Bodu Bala Sena General Secretary Ven. Galagodaththe Gnanasara Thera, should be arrested without delay.
PHU Publicity Secretary Thushara Dissanayake told a media briefing that if the roles were reversed and it had been Venerable Galagodaththe Gnanasara Thera that had made these death threats to Sally, the outcome would have been different and the so-called law and order authorities would have acted to arrest him.
Azath Sally, who remained silent when ISIS terrorists beheaded innocent people claiming that their religion demanded it, without condemning the inhuman acts, has now threatened to kill a monk. We vehemently condemn his statement which is a slap in the face of sovereignty and unity among the religions, he said.
As making death threats to someone is a punishable offence according to the Penal Code, Sally should be arrested and dealt with according to the law.
Meanwhile Sihala Ravaya convener Ven. Magalkande Sudaththa Thera and Bodu Bala Sena (BBS) Coordinator Dilantha Withanage today lodged a complaint at the Police Head Quarters to arrest Mr. Sally. (Piyumi Fonseka)

EC Chairman must have been influenced to postpone LG polls: Basil
	
Former Economic Development Minister Basil Rajapaksa said today that the Elections Commission Chairman Mahinda Deshapriya must have been influenced to postpone the local government election.
Mr. Rajapaksa said the Elections Commission Chairman had no legal obstruction to hold the election and requested him to hold the lection without being recorded in history as the person who did not hold an election for one and half years. 
The President had issued a gazette notification regarding the local government election. No one can go beyond it, he said.
Mr. Rajapaksa said the referendum during J.R. Jayawardenes tenure was the most corrupt election ever but postponing the election was even more corrupt.
Elections cannot be postponed as ministers want. It is an administrative matter. There is no provision in the law to take away the right of vote. The elections commission will have to take the responsibility for that, he said. (Ajith Siriwardana)

Pivithuru Hela Urumaya (PHU) General Secretary Udaya Gammanpila today said they had no doubt about new Central Bank Governor Dr. Indrajit Coomaraswamys capabilities since he was an experienced and a qualified person, but they had questions about his integrity.
He was charged in an insider trading case. Founder of the Galleon Group, an American-based investment fund management firm Raj Rajaratnam was jailed for 11-years in that case. In 2009, when the incident took place, our newly appointed Central Bank Governor was an adviser to the group. Further, he worked as a director of a subsidiary company of the Galleon Group, Mr. Gammanpila said.
He claimed that Mr. Rajaratnam, who employed Dr. Coomaraswamy, was a person who funded the LTTE.
"The Governments decision to appoint Dr. Coomaraswamy to replace former CB Governor Arjuna Mahendran is similar to exchanging ginger for chilli," Mr. Gammanpila said.
He said the 66-year-old Dr. Coomaraswamy would not be able to handle nationally responsible job because at that age he would lack the physical and mental fitness for it. (Piyumi Fonseka)

Lady using her clout to boost family business
	
A powerful fair one who has become a law unto herself at a vital point connected to the countrys economy has been the topic of much hush-hush talk among the employees high and low at the place for some time.

The lady said to be having the full weight of the political authority behind her, had been giving orders like mad to issue permits and allow concessions here and there and also to grant tax relief here and levy taxes there. 
The white collar high-ups who had been forced to carry out these arbitrary orders had decided that they should hit back by some means. And they provided all the dope on the lady to the Diyawanna member of Panchayudha fame and the latter unfolded the ladys track record with great relish in the august assembly. 
Meanwhile, some enterprising opposition guys had made inquiries as to why the lady had taken an extraordinary interest in granting tax relief in respect of certain motor vehicle shipments. And they had discovered that importing motor vehicles is her family business.
Meanwhile, a political wag asked: After all, would there be a powerful person in a Banana state who would not use his or her political clout to boost the family business

Maldives FM resigns citing opposition to death penalty
	
Maldives Foreign Minister Dunya Maumoon has resigned this afternoon, citing opposition to the governments plans to implement the death penalty.
In a statement shared with the media, Dunya said the resignation was one of the most difficult decisions she has taken.
Yet, the decision became inevitable because of the profound differences of opinion on the governments policy in implementing the death penalty at a time when serious questions are being asked, and concerns being expressed, about the delivery of justice in the Maldives, she said.
She added: I remain convinced that the Governments policy on death penalty, decided on a hasty fashion, would be detrimental to the image and reputation of the Maldives and would be a significant obstacle in achieving President [Abdulla] Yameens foreign policy goals, and building a resilient Maldives.
Her resignation comes amidst an escalating power struggle between her father, former President Maumoon Abdul Gayoom, and his half-brother the incumbent for control of the ruling party.
Shortly before Dunyas announcement, the Progressive Party of Maldives expelled her brother, MP Faris Maumoon, for voting against a government tourism bill at Gayooms behest.
The anti-corruption watchdog also summoned the elder Gayoom for questioning over an investigation into an audit report released eight years ago.
However, Dunya made no mention of the increasingly acrimonious PPM split.
She expressed gratitude to Yameen for his guidance and support during the past two and half years, and thanked cabinet colleagues, staff, and officers of the foreign service.
I remain hopeful, however, that the Maldives would be able to overcome many challenges in implementing President Yameens foreign policy, protect and promote the independence and the good image of the Maldives, and make Maldivians proud.
Yameens decision to end a six-decade moratorium has drawn criticism from UN human rights experts, the European Union and Amnesty International. They have called on the government to halt the planned execution of a 22-year-old death row inmate, Hussain Humam Ahmed, convicted of murdering a parliamentarian in a trial riddled with irregularities.
Gayoom has also opposed Humams execution.
Dunyas time in office has seen a dramatic shift in Maldivian foreign policy towards China and Saudi Arabia in the wake of fierce criticism by traditional allies, India, the EU, the UK, the US and the Commonwealth over human rights abuses and the jailing of opposition leaders.
Under Dunyas watch, the Maldives has so far avoided action despite a campaign for targeted sanctions on senior government officials by the opposition.
Dunya was appointed foreign minister in 2013 when Yameen assumed power. She had previously served as deputy minister for foreign affairs in Dr Mohamed Waheeds government in 2012 and her fathers government in 2008.
She is Gayooms eldest daughter.
Her brother Gassan Maumoon is a junior minister at the presidents office. Her twin sister, Yumna Maumoon, quit the government without comment in April.(Maldives Independent)

Manape is at the back of his hostility
	

A story making the rounds in political circles says that a certain political high-up with a plump face and fluent in English is all out for the blood of a people-friendly state purohita.

This high-up, incidentally a purohita of a high rank, is said to be carrying tales to a high party authority against the state one in a bid to jeopardize the latters political career.
The high-up had also complained to the party authority that the state one had brought the party to disrepute by staging an uncalled for protest in his area. However, the real reason behind the high ranking purohitas dislike for the state one is the latters growing popularity in the district while his standing among the people is on the wane. The purohita is said to be pressing the party leader to take disciplinary action against the state one, they say.

Motorists to get 30 days to pay traffic fines
	
The Government had taken a decision to extend the time given to motorists to pay fines for traffic violations from 14 days to thirty to facilitate the delays when paying traffic fines, Police Traffic Chief (DIG) Amarasiri Senaratne said today.
According to the Motor Traffic Act 224, if a court date was specified for a traffic violation that does not end in an accident, damage caused to public property or injury, the amount of the fine should be mentioned and summons sent to the offender. The driver/rider could choose to pay the fine to the court registrar without having to appear in front of a judge.
Discussions are presently under-way to implement the act, he said.
CCTV cameras are to be installed in all cities in a bid to curb crime and traffic offences.
In the past fines could not be charged from the original perpetrators of traffic offences that were caught on CCTV cameras due to vehicles not being registered to the present owners.
Discussions were under-way to implement the new act. We are also discussing ways to circumvent the issue of under whom the registration of a vehicle has been done with the Department of Motor Traffic, DIG Senaratne said. (Chaturanga Pradeep)

Only provided professional services to Rajaratnam: CB Governor
	
Newly appointed Central Bank Governor Indrajit Coomaraswamy said today he was delivering certain professional services as an economist to the Sri Lankan-born jailed hedge-fund manager Raj Rajaratnam.
My job was to provide him with research reports, Dr. Coomaraswamy said addressing his first news briefing as the Central Bank Governor.
Criticism has already been levelled at him by joint opposition parliamentarians about his connection to the Galleon Fund of the disgraced Mr. Rajaratnam, who was sentenced to11 years after he was found guilty of a securities fraud in the US.
Dr. Coomaraswamy said he got to know Mr. Rajaratnam as a friend from his university days.
I set a framework when I was in London to provide him with macroeconomic research. He knew my background and he wanted me to help. This happened for about 10 to 11 months and then he was charged. So it took about a year after that for me to legally wind up the operations, he said.
I knew him as a friendhe helped Sri Lanka and he had done a lot of positive thingslot of charity work. That was the Raj Rajaratnam I knew.
Speaking about major challenges faced by the economy in the short-term, Dr. Coomaraswamy said it all boils down to fiscal discipline. Protracted high fiscal deficits by successive governments have been a major drag on the Lankan economy and the main cause for the present instability. Dr. Coomaraswamy, throughout the past, has continuously criticized the vicious cycle of higher budget deficits, higher interest rates, and higher inflation and overvalued exchange rate, which have made the countrys exports less competitive.
This is diametrically opposed to what many of those South East Asian economies did managing their economies for prosperity. 
Dr. Coomaraswamy minced no words to say that the co-ordination of fiscal and monetary sectors will be key to achieving economic stabilization in a sustained manner.
Clearly the Finance Ministry has a very important role to play as well, said Dr. Coomaraswamy who served both in the Central Bank and the Finance Ministry in his early career. However in a country where politics trumps economics almost all the times, this cohesion is going to be extremely challenging.The main challenge is to ensure stabilisation of the economy is achieved in a sustained way. Because if you look at our history during the last 30 to 40 years, we start implementing stabilisation programmes, but we never pushed them through. So, we have these stop-go-policies  we let the economy get overheated and then we get in to balance of payment problems (because we lack strong macro-economic fundamentals) and/or high inflation and then we hold breaks by putting in place contractionary policies.
If you look at it, we have had these repeating stop-go-policy cycles, he reminded.
Therefore he reiterated the biggest challenge is for the Central Bank and the policy makers to commit to strong macro-economic fundamentals, which can be sustained for over 30 to 40 years.
But he warned the process would be not without pain. 
The stabilisation programme means pain. So, we need to get through that pain. If we do get through that pain, I think there are prospects of faster growth going forward, he remarked.

It has come to light that a Green heavyweight has abused his political clout to provide a security detail for a former Diyawanna member now facing a litany of charges including extortion and misuse of government vehicles.

A delegation from a political party in the main stream had met a very high political authority to complain about the favoured treatment given to the former Diyawanna member.
The political authority had explained that he had no hand in providing security to the former Diyawanna member at public expense adding that he could prove it. Thereafter, the high authority had called a Police high-up after turning the phones volume up. When the Police high-up came on the line, he had asked him on whose request he provided security to the former Diyawanna member. The Police high-up had replied: Sir, I assigned a security detail on instructions given by .
The delegates from the political party had clearly heard the reply given by the Police high-up.
Presently the high political authority had turned to them and asked them: Now do you accept that lots of things can happen without my knowledge

Suicide blast in Saudi City of Medina
	
A suicide bomber launched an attack Monday in the Saudi Arabian city of Medina, close to the Prophet's Mosque, one of Islam's holiest sites, killing four people and wounding another, according to an official with knowledge of the event, foreign media reported. This is the third attack in the country in the last 24 hours.
The bomber detonated his device as security officers were breaking their Ramadan fast, al-Arabiya TV said.
Footage on the TV network showed a blazing vehicle. There are no details of casualties and no official comment.
The mosque is the burial place of the Prophet Muhammad and Medina the second-holiest city in Islam after Mecca.
State-linked Sabq news and the Okaz newspaper also carried reports of the suicide attack.
Earlier, at least one explosion rocked the eastern city of Qatif.
Qatif is home to many minority Shia Muslims and the blast appeared to target a Shia mosque. No casualties have been reported so far.
A suspected suicide bomber also died after detonating a device near the US consulate in the city of Jeddah. Two security officers were slightly injured as they tackled the man, but no-one else was hurt.
Social media footage from Medina showed a vehicle on fire in a car park, with two security officers lying nearby.
Other footage showed ambulances and police vehicles streaming to the area.
It is not clear who is behind any of the attacks.
The attacks come with the holy month of Ramadan drawing to a close and ahead of the Eid al-Fitr holiday.
