A Royal fall-out
	
Sri Lankas stock market was all abuzz yesterday with the unexpected news of leading corporate figure Nimal Perera resigning from the director boards of the companies controlled by the business magnate Dhammika Perera amid speculation of a massive fall-out between the duo.
Nimal Perera yesterday informed the Colombo Stock Exchange of his resignation from the boards of Royal Ceramics, Amaya Leisure, The Kingsbury, Haycarb, Hayleys and Talawakelle Tea Estatesall controlled by Dhammika Pererawith effect from March 7.
The duo is arguably the most successful in riding Sri Lankas post-war economic boom, with aggressively acquiring a number of listed and unlisted companies including giant business houses such as Hayleys and Delmege. 
Perera is said to be controlling over 20 listed entities in the country and his net worth is estimated at over US $ 800 million.
Weve been together for about 14 to 15 years. Its time I go on my own. I want to start something with my two sons, who are now grown up, Nimal Perera told Mirror Business, following the announcement of his resignations.
Nimal Perera currently owns about 3 percent of Pan Asia Bank PLC, a mid-sized bank controlled by Dhammika Perera, through an investment vehicle he controls called NP Capital. He also owns a tea broking company.
Now I can get more involved in the capital market, says Nimal Perera. 
Dhammika was said to have spotted Nimal as an astute investor cum trader at the Colombo bourse and later Nimal was widely considered as Dhammikas de facto portfolio manager.
However, market sources for sometime had been speculating that the differences between the duo were steadily growing. 
In fact, in the last couple of years, Nimal Perera was seen trying his luck with some purchases on his own. Though many expect more fine points behind what appears to be the end of Dhammika-Nimal saga to unravel in the coming few weeks and months, its unlikely that anybody would think twice to say what the duo had going for so many years was a fine innings. 
Dhammika Perera was not available for comment. (Indika Sakalasooriya)

Australian service marks third anniversary of MH370 tragedy
	

THE HINDU, 08th MARCH, 2017 - The Australian government minister in charge of the suspended seabed search for the Malaysia Airlines jet told victims families and friends at an anniversary church service today that he remained hopeful that Flight 370 would be found. Darren Chester, minister for infrastructure and transport, and Angus Houston, the former Australian defence chief who coordinated the early months of the search efforts, were among around 100 who attended the private ceremony at St. Johns Anglican Cathedral in the eastern city of Brisbane to mark the third anniversary of the mysterious tragedy.  Several victims and relatives of the 239 passengers and crew aboard the Boeing 777 live in or near Brisbane.  Chester told the congregation that included families of New Zealand victim Paul Weeks, and Australians Robert and Catherine Lawton and Rodney and Mary Burrows that searchers had tried their best to end the uncertainty surrounding the crash. 
While to date we have been unsuccessful, we remain hopeful that at some stage in the future, there will be a breakthrough, the aircraft will be found, and we will be able to answer more of your questions, Chester said. 
He told the gathering that included diplomats from Malaysia, China and New Zealand that a memorial to the lost passengers and crew would be erected in the west coast city of Perth which had been a base for Indian Ocean air and sea search crews.

Ceylinco Life ends 2016 as countrys No 1 life insurer for 13th year in a row
	
Strong growth in new business and noteworthy returns on investments generated Rs 23.43 billion in total income for Ceylinco Life in FY 2016, during which the company retained its position as the market leader in Sri Lankas life insurance industry for the 13th consecutive year.
The Rs 3.6 billion improvement in income reflected a growth of 17.8 per cent over 2015, and was made up of a growth of Rs 1.6 billion or 12 per cent in premium income, and an increase of Rs 2 billion in investment income, which grew by 30 per cent in the 12 months ending 31st December 2016, the company said.
Ceylinco Life recorded gross premium income of Rs 15 billion in the year reviewed, selling 143,693 new life policies at a monthly average of 11,974.
The companys Life Fund grew by 14 per cent to Rs 77.93 billion at the end of the year under review, following a transfer of Rs 9.91 billion to the fund after the final shareholder transfer. This represents a 24 per cent increase over the transfers made in 2015. Over the past two years alone, Ceylinco Lifes Life Fund has grown by nearly 30 per cent.
The company recorded net profit of Rs 3.1 billion for the year and transferred Rs 2.3 billion to shareholders. Dividends and earnings to shareholders for the 12 months exceeded Rs 3.4 billion.
We are satisfied with the growth achieved in 2016 in the context of the general sentiment that prevailed in the market during the year, Ceylinco Life Managing Director/CEO R. Renganathan commented. Our strategy of focussing on the core message of life insurance and the on importance of trust when entering into a relationship for life has clearly been successful.
He said investment income for the year as Rs 8.78 billion reflected the professional management of the companys investment portfolio, which grew by a solid 20 per cent to Rs 80.75 billion as at 31stDecember 2016.
At the end of the year under review, Ceylinco Lifes investment portfolio comprised of Government Securities (53 per cent); Fixed Deposits (9 per cent); Real Estate (8 per cent); Corporate Debt (29 per cent) and Others (1 per cent). All investments are made in conformity with the investment guidelines stipulated under the Regulation of the Insurance Industry Act No 43 of 2000 and are subject to regular monitoring by the Insurance Board of Sri Lanka (IBSL).
A key performance indicator that represents the companys financial strength and ability to meet its financial obligations in respect of its insurance contracts is its Capital Adequacy Ratio, which stood at 335 per cent at the end of 2016, more than two and a half times the statutory requirement of 120 per cent.
Goss claims and benefits paid by Ceylinco Life to policyholders in 2016 surpassed Rs 6.8 billion, an 11 per cent improvement over the previous year. This included Rs 2.9 billion in annual bonuses and Avurudu cash bonuses to more than 300,000 policyholders and maturities totalling Rs 4.2 billion. The annual bonus pay-out in 2016 was the highest in the companys history.
One of the highlights of the year reviewed was the reaffirmation by World Finance, the respected UK-based magazine, of Ceylinco Life as the Best Life Insurance Company in Sri Lanka for the thirdsuccessive year, following an in-depth assessment of key performance indicators. This prestigious accolade is based on scores accorded to the company on multiple parameters pertaining to long term insurance. Among the areas looked at were average time to underwrite and to issue a policy; how risk exposure is assessed and accommodated; achievements in the 12 months reviewed; how appropriate cover is ensured for new and existing clients; Customer Retention Rate; Average Time in Claim Settlement; New Customer Acquisition Rate; Average Cost per Policy and Net Premium.
Another highlight of 2016 was Ceylinco Lifes increased emphasis on greening its operations. Besides the eco-friendly branch buildings opened in the course of the year, the company launched a series of environment-related initiatives across its branch network that generated a saving of more than 43,000 litres of fuel, an improvement of 12 per cent over 2015; a saving of 46,228 units of electricity and a reduction of 2.8 million sheets of A4-sized paper.
Ceylinco Life also broke new ground in 2016 with the installation of the biggest solar electricity system in the city of Colombo at the companys Head Office. With a system capacity of 63.18kW, the solar power unit generates a saving of 7,200 units of electricity per month, resulting in an annual reduction of 65 tons of CO2 emitted to the environment as a result of consumption of power from the national grid and thermal power generators.

China asks North Korea to stop missile tests, tells U.S. and South to seek talks.
	
China, fearing a rapid escalation of tension on the Korean peninsula, called on North Korea on Wednesday to stop its nuclear and missile tests and for South Korea and the United States to stop joint military drills and seek talks instead. 
North Korea launched four ballistic missiles on Monday in response to the joint U.S.-South Korea military exercises, which it regards as preparation for war. 
Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said the tests by the North and the joint drills across the border in South Korea were causing tension to increase like two accelerating trains coming toward each other. [L3N1GL1L4] 
Chinas suggestion is, as a first step, for North Korea to suspend nuclear and missile activities, and for the U.S. and South Korea to also suspend large-scale military drills, Wang said at his annual news conference on the sidelines of the meeting of Chinas parliament in Beijing. 
Such a dual suspension would allow all sides to return to the negotiating table, Wang said. 
North Korea fired the four missiles into the sea off Japans northwest coast on Monday, angering South Korea and Japan with the latest in a series of ballistic missile and nuclear tests in defiance of the U.N. resolutions in recent months. 
Holding nuclear weapons wont bring security, using military force wont be a way out, Wang said. There remains a chance of resuming talks, there is still hope for peace.
His comments came a day after the U.S. military started to deploy the first elements of its advanced Terminal High Altitude Area Defence(THAAD) anti-missile system to South Korea. 
That deployment added to the complexity of the tensions between South Korea and China, which opposes the THAAD deployment that it says destroys the regional security balance. 
Wang reiterated those concerns on Wednesday, describing its deployment as a mistake. 
China says as part of its objection that the systems far-reaching radar can penetrate into its territory. In turn, South Korea and the United States have said the missile system is aimed only at defending against any North Korean missiles.

Crescent Global South Asia sponsors Sri Lanka Insurance Awards

Ltd Director Indrajith Fernando, IBSL Director General Damayanthi Fernando, Ceylinco Insurance General Director Technical Jagath Alwis, Sri Lanka Insurance Institute President Thusitha Nandasiri, Sri Lanka Insurance Institute CEO Udeni Kiridena


When the crme de la crme of the local insurance industry come together to meet the students who have won awards and obtained exam certificates from the Sri Lanka Insurance Institute, it creates a day to remember. 
This signature event was held at the Bishops College auditorium earlier this month and was exclusively sponsored by Crescent Global South Asia, part of Crescent Global Group, a Lloyds accredited insurance broker.
Understanding the need for more qualified and recognized personnel in the insurance industry, Crescent Global Director Indrajith Fernando said his organisation takes a personal interest in the graduates of the Sri Lanka Insurance Institute. It is the only institution that produces the quality of individuals that the insurance industry in Sri Lanka so desperately needs, he said.
Fernando went on to say that the insurance industry requires a special kind of individual as an industry practitioner. Insurance is an industry that is often misunderstood and is thought to thrive on peoples anxieties. It is up to the industry practitioners to help solve the misconceptions that clients and the general may have and the correct subject knowledge is very important for this cause.
The chief guest, Dr. Jagath Alwis, said that this approach requires a particular precision training and insurance industry captains have come to respect the Sri Lanka Insurance Institute, as it produces candidates who have the right attitudes and of course the right level of industry-based knowledge to drive the industry. We are committed to developing the Insurance Institute and to support in any way to further this cause.
Crescent Global South Asia operates in many countries across the region and understands the issues of both the local and global insurance industry like no other. When the Sri Lanka Insurance Institute, the industry educational body, was awarding its successful students, Crescent Global was delighted to partner the worthy cause, said Fernando.
The insurance business is expanding to such an extent that Fernando sees that there should be a new approach to training new recruits for the insurance business. He hopes that Crescent Global South Asias alliance with the Sri Lanka Insurance Institute will help the industry evolve and provide the highly skilled and knowledgeable individuals that the industry needs.
We are discussing and hoping to advance education further with Crescent by using the web-educate portal, which is owned by Crescent Global Group and provides 24/7 online insurance training. We have also agreed with Sri Lanka Insurance Institute to launch Merit scholarships and carrier guidance for the deserving in the industry, in memory of my late Father Aleric L. Fernando.   
He believes that the institute works with the signal desire to produce the future leaders of the insurance industry. The institute also facilitates the special kind of learning that peers appreciate and the insurance industry elites desire, which is why when a cohort of insurance industry practitioners graduate from the institute, the mentors of the industry have great expectations for their future and as such they feel it is so important for them to be present at this event, for which Crescent Global is the sole principal sponsor.
This is a prestigious unique event of the Sri Lanka Insurance Institute and we wish to thank Crescent Global South Asia for their commitment to support. Sri Lanka Insurance Institute is the pioneer educational body in insurance education and we look forward to the support of all stakeholders to enhance the necessary talent for the industry, Sri Lanka Insurance Institute President Thusitha Nandasiri said.
Crescent Globals headquarters is situated in the City of London, close to the most important insurance marketplace in the world, Lloyds of London. The business handled by the firm emanates from more than 50 countries, via its global office network. Crescent Global is a member of the Global Broker Network (GBN.)

Cricket Board and I didnt see eye to eye: Gurusinha
	
Sri Lanka Cricket recently appointed Asanka Gurusinha, a member of the 1996 World-Cup- winning team as the Cricket Manager in a bid to help the transition of the national team.


Read the Full Interview

Sri Lanka Cricket recently appointed Asanka Gurusinha, a member of the 1996 World-Cup- winning team as the Cricket Manager in a bid to help the transition of the national team. In an exclusive interview with Daily Mirror, Asanka domiciled in Australia for about two decades since leavingSri Lanka soon after the World Cup triumph speaks of the challenges faced by him as manager, the national team and also what forced his premature retirement from cricket.
Q It has taken you two decades to return to Sri Lanka and give something back to the game. What prevented you for so long
It is an interesting question that has been asked on several occasions. Nothing held me back. There were quite a few times that they approached me during the past 15 years to fit me into different posts. And I thought this is the right time to return and do something. I think Sri Lanka Cricket is on the right track. That doesnt mean it was not on the right track earlier but I think with lot of good people in the support staff and in good positions within the SLC, for instance Sanath Jayasuriya as Chairman of Selectors and Aravinda de Silva as Cricket Committee Chairman. I played so much of my cricket with those guys. So I thought this is the best time to come and work with them and give something back to Sri Lanka Cricket. 
Q You said there have been several calls earlier but you never took up the challenge. What is so impressive about the current set of officials that convinced you to take up such an important post
Like I mentioned, it was because of Aravinda, Sanath, the current selection committee and all those guys I played with. So to me its much easier to work with guys whom I have worked with and whom I can trust and communicate with easily. We dont have arguments or anything. I can pick up a phone and call Sanath and talk and give my opinion about team selection. I think thats the good thing for me. I am not talking about the board as such. Sri Lanka Cricket has done a lot of changes for the good. 
Q What can you do better than what the others in the support staff have not done to take this young team forward
I am not saying I have miracle cures or anything like that. But about working with these guys. I think they are talented, the skills and everything is there. It is just that sometimes they are tweaking a little bit, because you can get into a semi-final but to get to a final and win, you need that extra experience or extra planning. I think one area that lots of people have been talking about is mental toughness and that is something I plan to concentrate on. Mental toughness is a big word and its not an easy thing. We got to look at some activities that the players can do so that they can build on it. You cannot put on a switch and say that you are mentally tough. 
Q When Sri Lanka won the World Cup in 1996, we only had a coach, a physiotherapist and a manager but right now there are too many backstage players in the side. Do you think its really necessary for a team
I think the game has changed a lot from the time I retired when you look at the amount of cricket they play -- I mean the three formats of the game. If someone actually plays all three formats, he doesnt actually have a break. So a support staff to look after these players is really important. Most of the support staff may not have a role to play during a game, but their job begins when the game ends. We got a masseur to make sure the players are ready for the game on the next day while the physios and trainers are there to make sure the players are fit enough. You cannot do major fitness sessions since they are playing so much cricket but they are looking at recovery and rest. Those are the reasons they are in the team with different coaches for fielding, bowling and batting (we do not have one for batting). Its just specializing. Its a professional job now. 
Q There is a well-known cliche that says, too many cooks spoil the soup. Dont you think having too many backstage players may impact adversely on the team
I dont think so. It may have an adverse effect. Thats where the important part comes in. How you strategize and plan it and hold everyone accountable is what finally matters. Its not just the players who have to be held accountable but it applies to the support staff needs as well. Thats what we will be implementing slowly with Fordie (Graham Ford). Ford and I will work very closely with each other to look at what the bowling coach will do on a certain day and what he will achieve from that session. We are going to be very specific. As I said this is just my third day. I will sit with Fordie and work out the kind of strategy to make sure that we are being very, very specific. Thats what happens these days. The coaching is very specific now. You go to a net and you see people practicing the reverse sweep and thats where I feel its good to have coaches. Your question is pretty good and we need to put them on the right path and make them accountable for that. 
Q Could you elaborate on your role as the Cricket Manager
Its working and coordinating with the Selection Committee, the Cricket Committee, the Coach and the Team. I will work very closely with Fordie and the team, looking and strategizing, looking and analyzing and most probably I will start analyzing from next week for the Champions Trophy. So that Fordie can focus not with the Test match going on and I can do all that analyzing for Fordie to make sure that we are on the right track. 
Q You were a brilliant No. 3 batsman in the bygone days. After that we had Kumar and then we have Kusal Mendis increasingly proving to be a good No:3  bat Could you explain the traits of a good No:3 batsman
I think the number three position is really different to every other position. In some games you will walk to the middle in the first over or might stay in the dressing room for a couple of sessions. So mentally you have to be ready to switch on and switch off very quickly and then go and play according to the situation. Normally the No. 3 is expected to bat for a longer time and is the backbone of the game so that stroke-makers can go around him. The difference with Sanga is, hes a legend. He was more aggressive and I dont think anybody I have seen can come close to him as a No. 3. 
Q Soon after the 1996 World Cup, you decided to quit and migrate to Australia. You were just 30 then. Looking back do you think, you made that decision too early
When I look back I dont think so. I know I was young, I was just 30-years-old when I quit playing international cricket. I dont have any regrets. That time I had to make a call, looking at my future, my family and I dont have any regrets. I think I did the right thing then, because I suffered some injuries and had a few other things happening. So no regrets. 
QApart from the injury that you mention, what else really forced you to take that decision
Thats something that lots of people dont know. At that time the Sri Lankan Cricket Board and I werent seeing eye to eye. They were making it very difficult for me to keep playing the game. When you dont enjoy the game, you need to walk away from it. It was tough as I said to make that decision. I dont think anybody knows when to retire. It was a tough call and when I wasnt enjoying the game, I thought I should walk away and get someone else to do that. I will not keep any grudges and all those people are still my friends. I had to respect them for the decision they made at that time because they were the decision makers. I had to respect that even though I did not agree. 
Q Had it not been for that, where do you think, you would have ended up in cricket
If I played without retiring I would have definitely played the 1999 World Cup who knows I would have captained as well. 
Q If you can recall the role you played in the 1996 World Cup final which set the tone for our victory
I dont think its just the World Cup final but it was actually the whole process that started a couple of years back with Dave Whatmore coming in as coach. My job at that time was to make sure that I bat as long as possible at one end, because we had so many stroke-makers coming from Sanath, Romesh Kaluwitharana, Aravinda, Arjuna, Roshan and all those guys. With all those stroke-makers on one side, the plan was for me to bat right through on the other side. So we can build it. Thats exactly what I kept doing till I retired. 
Q How was your relationship with your captain Arjuna Ranatunga The reason why I asked was because of a known fact that he had a say in your early retirement
Very good. I dont blame anybody for my retirement. At the end of the day I made that decision. Arjuna and I are very close friends and I still talk to him regularly. When he once came to Melbourne he stayed with me as well. The 96 World Cup team was a closely knit unit. We had lots of reunions during the past three or four years and we were a very good unit when we carried the team banner in 1996. 
Q Looking at the future what are the areas we must improve and change to be a force to be reckoned with at the 2019 World Cup
To win a World Cup, you need to do everything right, which is not easy. There are so many teams who want to be perfect and one area in any tournament is fielding. You cannot miss any catches. I will not accept anybody who says he tried. At that level you got to take it. You got to take run-outs, you cannot miss it. You must make sure that every ball you throw hits the stump and results in a run-out. Fielding will make the difference in the 2019 World Cup in England. Yes it will be played in England and the ball will move a little bit but I dont think thats going to be a major issue because if you take the catches and the run-outs you can even defend 250 runs. 
Q Champions Trophy is just three months away but we are still to find the right player combination. Do you think we can be a team to be reckoned with in England
Absolutely. The three one-dayers against Bangladesh will be a starting point for us. Thats what we want to do to make sure that we have stability going forward. At the same time theres a responsibility for the players as well. They need to make sure that they do their job well and keep performing. Performance will come when you do the right thing. So theres a job for everyone and thats pretty much I have as Cricket Manager to get that strategy going. 
Q Kusal Mendis played a brilliant innings yesterday. As a No. 3 batsman how do you analyze his innings and do you think he is in for greater success in that position
Absolutely. He has got a bright future. This is not the first time, he got a big hundred. He got a big one against Australia. As team manager I will have to consult the selectors to guage whether he needs to play T20 for a while. Sometimes it is better to keep him away from the T20s and play him in one-dayers and Tests and build him up to a higher level. Right now he is compelled to switch from one format of the game to another very quickly, its a bit tough. I dont want to get him used to the T20 format of cricket only where he plays a variety of shots. 
Q Do you support the idea of having a separate T20 team just as most teams in the world
I will always support that. Its something I will seriously look at with the selectors and the team management. Also with the board, because for something like that Ill have to work with the Executive Committee and look at what we can do. If you want to do well consistently in T20 cricket, we will have to have a separate team for T20. 
Q There was also a discussion on introducing a split captaincy -- one captain for Tests and the ODIs and another for the T20s Do you support such a move
I think a lot depends on the player. Take Angelo. He can hold his position in any XI. But I think Angelo will make a call probably pretty soon on what he wants to do. From what I have seen in the past of players of Angelos calibre, many have given up T20s to focus on One-Dayers and Tests. I think people like Michael Clarke did that. Steve Smith is still playing T20 but I doubt whether he will play that longer. Angelo as a player and a captain will make a decision when he is ready. Angelo is more important to Sri Lanka cricket for Tests and One-dayers. Thats my opinion. 
Q Even though we have been a tough team to beat at home, we have struggled under foreign conditions Where do you think is the problem
Is it our club cricket system or the spin-friendly surfaces Look we can sit here and talk about club cricket and pitches. But I think Sri Lanka Cricket is on the right track, playing with lot of foreign teams. Theres England-A team is here. We have a U-19 team playing and an emerging team going to Bangladesh. I feel thats the best way to improve and get this young guys to play overseas a lot more or even with good teams. Because if we keep depending on the club structure, to change and do things differently we will be left behind in world cricket. Thats something I really like about Sri Lanka Cricket. They are focusing a lot on young people to play outside Sri Lanka. For instance the U-19 team is going to Australia in April, thats unbelievable for these young guys. But the importance is not just to go on a tour but to have a plan and a goal and gradually achieve our targets.
Its not about winning at this stage but about developing a player. I hope we can have U-19 players walking straight in to the national team, the same way we did -- Aravinda, Arjuna, Roshan and myself, we all walked straight from school to play for Sri Lanka. Thats what I want to achieve and that will be the happiest day of my life, if I can see that happening within the next 12 months.

Dullas to act for Dinesh: Speaker turns down request
	
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya today turned down a request made by the joint opposition to appoint MP Dullas Alahapperuma as its acting group leader in place of MP Dinesh Gunawardene who has been suspended from the House for a week.
The Speaker said he had no authority to do so as the matter had to be decided by UPFA Group Leader Nimal Siripala de Silva.
Mr Alahapperuma said he has to raise an important question as per the standing orders 23(2). "Please heed to our request," he told Speaker assuring that the joint opposition has no objective of disrupting the House.
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe who joined in the cross talks said standing orders did not provide provision for a group leader to assign anyone else to raise questions under the said standing orders. However MP Wimal Weerawansa argued claiming that Mr. Wickremesinghe assigned others to raise questions on behalf of him during his tenure and the leader of opposition.(Yohan Perera)

President Maithripala Sirisena today said the evidence given by a former lady superintendent of the Central Bank was the factual, correct and steady evidence given by any witness called before the Presidential Commission to investigate allegations against the former governor of the Central Bank.
Addressing a ceremony organised by the Sri Lanka Freedom Party Women Organisation at the SLFP Headquarters to mark International Womens Day, the President said as a woman she had demonstrated her valour to fulfil her duty honestly and steadily.
She had stated that she was under pressure and that there was nothing that could be done in her capacity. Her evidence is a classic example of the honesty, steadfastness and the qualities of a woman dedicated to fulfilling her duty.

He made this remark in response to a query made by a TNA MP on the subject during the Prime Ministers question time in the House last afternoon.

FUTA token strike called off
	
The token strike, which was launched by the Federation of University Teachers' Association (FUTA) had been conditionally suspended with immediate effect due to a sudden decision made at the association ExCo meeting, Assistant Secretary Athulasiri Kumara Samarakoon said.
Speaking to the Daily Mirror Mr. Samarakoon said the trade union action would be conditionally suspended on the basis of the letter dated 07.03.2017 received from the UGC, as a reciprocal gesture to demonstrate FUTA's desire to resolve the issues quickly and fairly.
The FUTA commenced a trade union action yesterday demanding the Government to resolve their salary issues and urging the Government to safeguard the State education. 
However, the Secretary said they had received an invite to a meeting scheduled for March 13, 2017 with the Minister of Finance and his officials and the UGC.
He said depending on the outcome of the meeting, the FUTA would take decision resuming its trade union action. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

Indian fishermen to complain to UNHRC
	
If both Indian and Sri Lankan governments remain silent regarding the killing of the Rameshwaram fisherman, Indian fishermen's organisations yesterday said they would complain to the United Nations Human Rights Commission (UNHRC) against the shooting.
The Chairperson of National Fishworkers Forum (NFF) M. Ilango said a thorough investigation should be launched into the fisherman's death and those who are responsible should be brought to book.
"During the post mortem, AK-47 bullets have been found inside the victims's body and there are witnesses of the shooting. But, Sri Lankan Navy has denied the allegation. Who shot him then We need to know who are responsible for this murder," M. Ilango said.
He stressed that both governments should move faster for a permanent solution to the long-standing fishermen crisis.
South Indian Federation of Fishermen Societies (SIFFS) said the alleged shooting was inhuman and unacceptable.
"Previously, our fishermen have been harassed and intimidated by the Sri Lanka Navy. But, this is the first serious incident that happened after five years," V. Vivekanandan of SIFFS said.
He said local authorities of both countries are under tremendous pressure to act as the issue has been dragged towards a political context.
Indian media reported that the deceased was hit by a bullet in his throat while fishing with five others on the seas between Sri Lankan island of Katchatheevu and Danushkodi of Pamban Island, Tamil Nadu on Monday.
When contacted by the Daily Mirror, Sri Lanka Navy Spokesperson Lieutenant Commander Chaminda Walakuluge yesterday had denied such allegations and stated the Navy had not been ordered to fire at Indian fishermen.
However, The Hindu reported today that Indian High Commissioner to Sri Lanka is scheduled to meet Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe in Colombo regarding the shooting.
According to NFF, fishermen from five districts of Tamil Nadu Ramanathapuram, Pudukkottai, Nagapattinam, Thanjavur and Thiruvarur are fishing in Sri Lankan waters.
Fishermen's organisations from the five districts are meeting tomorrow (09) in Nagapattinam to discuss on a protest campaign, demanding legal actions against the responsible parties of the Rameshwaram shooting. (Piyumi Fonseka, reporting from India)

## Title: Is the dry spell in Gampaha man-made

Is the dry spell in Gampaha man-made
	
Dry weather prevailed in many areas in the country during the recent weeks. According to the data released by the Disaster Management Centre, nearly one million people in about 14 districts are said to have been affected by this drought. Specialists in the Agro-Meteorologist Department of Agriculture predicted a food crisis. They said it was due to a result of change in the climate. However, the dry spell in Gampaha is said to be caused by a man-made phenomenon. 
Accordingly, word had been spreading among residents in Negombo, Opatha, Kotugoda and Katunayake that the clearing of clouds using helicopters had resulted in the drying of wells and canals in some areas in the Gampaha District. The temperature in these areas, particularly in Katunayake, has been high during the past few days, around 30 degrees c. 
M. Perera, a worker at a factory in the Katunayake Free Trade Zone, said he too had heard this rumour. I have been hearing about this for some time since the work on the runway of the Bandaranaike International Airport began. However, we have been experiencing some light showers during the past few days, he said. 
K.P. Sandeep, a resident of Opatha had also heard the story of the clouds being pushed away by aircraft after the work on the runway project began, from his fellow villagers. They said some chemical was being sprayed by a helicopter but I have not come across anyone who saw the helicopter, he said. He added that there were some showers in his area on Monday, February 27. 
A catholic nun who did not wish to be named said people in Seeduwa, where her convent was located, had related the same story. People in my area say this has resulted in the dry spell. According to her, another interesting phenomenon was taking place in the area; a change of weather in different areas in one single locality. Recently I noticed that it was not raining in my convent garden but that it was raining heavily less than a kilometre away. People say this happens as a result of pushing away clouds by spraying chemicals at them, she added. 
Secretary, Ministry of Transport and Aviation Nihal Somaweera said his ministry had not given any permission to the Airport Aviation Authority to carry out such an action to date. The Airport and Aviation Authority has not sought the permission of the ministry to carry out such a move he said. 
Meanwhile, the Department of Meteorology said many parts of the country, including the Gampaha District, would experience rains in the coming days. The department said cloudy skies along with showers or thundershowers could be expected in most parts of the country. Showers above 100mm are expected in some places, especially in the Eastern, Uva, Southern, Sabaragamuwa, Central and North Central provinces. The sea area off the coast from Galle to Trincomalee via Hambanthota, Pottuvil and Batti and the sea area off the coast extending from Colombo to Mannar via Puttalam can be rough during thundershowers due to the temporary increase of wind speed up to 55 to 60 kmph, the Department forecast added. 
A spokesman from the Department of Meteorology who was commenting on the pushing of clouds said such technology did exist. The spokesman, who is a duty forecaster, said it was very costly and that a country like Sri Lanka could not afford it. 
This kind of technology has been discussed by scientists as far back as 2008 and had been attempted during the 2008 Beijing Olympics, when chemicals were apparently fired into the sky to disperse clouds for the opening ceremony. 
Scientists have said lasers could be used to guarantee a cloudless sky. Swiss researchers have succeeded in using the technology in lab tests to create cloud formation. In theory, it could be used to trigger rainfall far out at sea or over uninhabited land  and keep it away from a major event. 
The technique has also been used to control lightning, with the long-term aim of diverting it away from built-up areas. Known as cloud seeding, it was pioneered in the US in the 1940s and involves inducing rain by firing silver iodide or dry ice into a cloud, simulating the natural salt, dust and other tiny particles in the atmosphere that help water droplets form, according to a foreign report published in 2013. There were also reports that Russia too had used these methods.  There have been reports that Sri Lanka was trying to do the opposite in 2012. The media at the time reported that the previous government was attempting to use Chinese technology to bring about artificial rains. There were reports published in the media in 2012, quoting the-then Disaster Management Minister Mahinda Amaraweera, that Sri Lanka was seeking Chinese assistance to generate artificial rains. The then minister was reported as saying this in Koggala and that it was in order to avoid a drought which was expected at the time. However, Sri Lanka failed to avoid the drought as such a situation was observed around the country, which even reduced the paddy harvest, causing the government to import rice.

DPA, 08th MARCH, 2017 - The British parliaments upper house backed an amendment to Prime Minister Theresa Mays bill to trigger formal Brexit talks, insisting on votes in both houses of parliament before an agreement is finalized with the European Union.
The unelected House of Lords voted 366 to 268 on Tuesday for the Labour-led cross-party amendment to the bill to trigger two years of formal Brexit negotiations.
The vote created a second extra hurdle for May after her government was defeated on an earlier amendment to the bill to protect the rights of EU citizens living in Britain. She must now return the bill to parliaments main house, the Commons.

Prasanna has appeared in 34 one-day and 14 Twenty20 internationals, including February's series against Australia.
"The more match-winners on your teamsheet the better," head coach David Ripley told BBC Radio Northampton.
"It's his consistency with the ball, he's been bowling the power-play against Australia and doing a good job of that.
"There's some Sri Lankan cricket but at this stage it looks like he can pretty much do the whole competition, which is positive for continuity."(BBC)

Pan Asia Bank gears for faster growth as Rs. 2bn rights issue snapped up
	
Pan Asia Banking Corporation PLC this week announced successful completion of its rights issue to raise up to Rs.2.06 billion placing the bank on a much stronger footing to pursue a higher wave of growth in 2017 and beyond. 
The bank in December 2016 announced to issue 147.5 million shares at one new share for every two shares held at an issue price of Rs.14 to fund its future growth while maintaining a strong capital base. The banks share issue carried further significance given the fact that this was the first rights issue in the Colombo Stock Exchange for 2017 which would certainly have led to enhanced investor sentiments about the capital market in Sri Lanka.
Speaking on the share issue, the banks Acting Chief Executive Officer, Lalith Jayakody attributed the success to the strong investor confidence placed on the banks current and future strategies by its shareholders.
When we announced this rights issue we had the full confidence in our shareholders that they would be behind us. They knew that we have chosen a growth path which is both steadfast and sustainable. So, I believe this was the reason behind our successfully raising over two billion rupees and close the issue on a high note, Jayakody said.
Pan Asia Bank is the fastest growing commercial bank in Sri Lanka with its assets growing by over 20 percent to be slightly below Rs.130 billion as of end of 2016.
The bank also increased its profit after tax by 20 percent to Rs.1.25 billion, recording the highest ever after tax profit earned by the bank in its 21 years history. 
This is also not the first instance where the bank saw increased investor appeal for its call for capital. Whenever the bank has made a capital call, both its existing and new investors have responded overwhelmingly to become part of the banks growth story.
This was amply demonstrated by the two back to back debenture issues made by the bank in 2014 and 2015 where the bank raised Rs.3.0 billion and Rs.4.0 billion respectively on their first days of the openings as these issues were oversubscribed by multiple times since few hours of their openings.
The rights issue also places Pan Asia Bank well above the minimum core capital requirement of Rs.7.5 billion which needs to be met by March 31, 2017 as the bank now has a core capital base of Rs.8.67 billion.
During 2016 the Tier I Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR) improved to 8.37 percent from 7.82 percent a year ago due to the strong internal capital generation during the period under review. While we have fulfilled and exceeded these interim minimum capital requirements stipulated by the regulator, we are well aware of the future capital needs in view of the forthcoming BASEL III enhanced capital adequacy ratios and also Central Banks enhanced capital levels. We have already formulated strategies to meet these enhanced capital requirements in a timely manner and will keep all our stakeholders informed of such measures, Jayakody added.
With this stronger capital base, the bank is now geared to further expand its loans and advances to the customers while maintaining healthy capital adequacy ratios.

Parliamentarians getting more rewards How over the history MPs salaries and perks increased
	
The Supplementary Estimate for the financial provision of Rs.537,962,790 to purchase vehicles for seven ministers, three State ministers and two Deputy ministers was tabled in Parliament this week. Presented by the Chief Whip of the Government Gayantha Karunathilaka, the Supplementary Estimate states that it was necessitated, as provisions allocated last year for this purpose were not utilized. 
Accordingly, the Supplementary Estate sought approval to purchase a vehicle for the Special Assignments Minister at Rs.42,600,000. It also requested the provision of Rs.42,000,000 to purchase a vehicle for the Telecommunication and Digital Infrastructure Minister, Rs.86,000,000 for the vehicle of the State Minister of Irrigation and Water Resources Management, Rs.41,000,000 for the Science, Technology and Research Minister, Rs 43,000,000 for the Tourism and Christian Affairs Minister, Rs.43,000,000 for the Higher Education and Highways Minister and Rs.43,000,000 for the Sustainable Development and Wild Life Minister. The Supplementary Estimates also include financial provision of Rs.62,250,000 to purchase vehicles for the Auditor Generals Department and for a vehicle on lease for the Auditor General. 
Whenever a general election looms, candidates from various political parties voluntarily offer to solve all our problems and dedicate their lives for the common people. We usually witness this every five years. During the election period, we are their sisters, brothers or any other relative depending on the age difference. 
The bright and gleaming smiles on their faces and their apparent commitment towards fulfilling the needs of the people is displayed when gifting the voter with mobile phones, T shirts, caps, rice, coconut and other food items. These are often supplemented with intoxicants such as liquour and cigarettes for active supporters who dedicate their time solely towards these election campaigns. 
The residences of such politicians who strive to serve the common people are more or less like a Dansala at all
times of the day. In their generosity during such campaigns, a politicians residence is only second to the greatest donor, Anepindusitanan (baron), mentioned in Buddhist scriptures. 
However, after having been elected to Parliament, we begin to see a difference in our friendly politician, who just before the elections regularly visited our humble abode with numerous promises. While the momentum of giving promises gradually fades away, our representatives in Parliament seem to be drowning in a sea of rewards for being elected to serve the people.  It is no secret that being elected to Parliament has become a way to earn millions, despite the acute economic problems in the country.  The authority on the revision of remuneration of MPs and ministers is vested constitutionally with the Parliament itself. It has been revealed that when the salaries of the officers in judicial services are revised, MPs too are entitled to these salary revisions.  The proposal tabled by late minister Jeyaraj Fernandopulle on November 23, 2006 to revise the salaries and allowances of ministers and parliamentarians concurrently to the revision of salaries in the judicial services was passed in parliament. This method of revision is still in effect. 

The late minister also added that there should be a comparative revision of parliamentarians salaries and allowances with the revisions of the judicial services in future.  There were instances of increasing the allowance of members elected to the State Councils even during the State Council period prior to independence. 

The Leader of House (State Council) D.B. Jayathilaka brought about a move on July 28, 1931 for the payment of allowances to members, considering their economic difficulties at the time. Accordingly, the proposed amount of allowances were as follows: 
For a member Rs.400 
	Deputy Chairman of the council   Rs.750 
	Ministers and Speaker Rs.1,000 
The move also stated that these allowances should be increased to Rs.1,500 for Chairman of Committees and the Speaker, Rs.1,000, Deputy Chairman of Committees and Deputy Speaker and Rs.500 for a member of the Council. This move was seconded by State Council member D.S. Senanayake. 
Meanwhile, S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike proposed that the allowance paid to a member of the SC be decreased to Rs.300 which was seconded by Sir John Kotelawala. Another proposal was tabled by State Councilor G.C.S. Corea, requesting a payment of Rs.200 for a member living within ten miles of Colombo, Rs.300 for members living within 50 miles and Rs.400 for members beyond 50 miles. However, only the move brought by the leader of the House D.B. Jayathilaka was passed by the SC. Government servants salaries are formulated after considering the qualifications and experience, whereas no such requirements are necessary for parliamentarians to be entitled to a revised salary. Their ability to gain a sufficient number of votes to be elected into Parliament is the only criterion for such financial benefits.  However, due to numerous public protests, the Parliament had to stall the increase in salary and allowances of MPs corresponding to the increase in salaries of the Supreme Court judges during the latter part of last year. 
Recently, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe stressed the need to increase the amount of allowances now paid to parliament members considering the volume of work they have to do to serve the people. He moved to increase the allowance to Rs.2,500, expand transport facilities and provide air tickets to parliamentarians in the Northern and Eastern provinces. These increases were implemented without any hesitation. However, the move to provide additional vehicles on hire was suspended by President Maithripala Sirisena. 
MPs outside Colombo are entitle to a 900 sq. ft house
	Recently, the government spent Rs.108 million on foreign trips for ministers and MPs
Besides the financial benefits, parliamentarians are also provided with other facilities. MPs outside Colombo are entitle to a 900 sq. ft house. while ministers are provided with two-storey houses in Cinnamon Gardens, coupled with entitlements for a $50,000 worth duty-free vehicle.  Other free services provided to them are indigenous and western medical treatment and spa services, communication equipment and stationery. Members of parliament also enjoy bank loan facilities on very easy and simple terms and concessions for the education of their children. While ordinary people are given Rs.250,000 for the treatment of certain diseases, politicians are fortunate enough to receive concessions on medical expenses, amounting to several millions of rupees.  Recently, the government spent Rs.108 million on foreign trips for ministers and MPs while arrangements had also been made to provide leasing facilities for the vehicles of 40 MPs.  At present a total of Rs 192,817 is paid to an MP as salary and allowances.  In addition, the expenses of their office staff including salaries, telephone and fuel expenses are also paid through public money. Entitlement to financial rewards for parliamentarians continues even after the termination of their term in Parliament. They are paid a monthly pension after spending a five-year period in Parliament.

Plot behind Dineshs suspension: JO says at 'car park' news briefing
	
Joint opposition Chief Organiser MP Dullas Alahapperuma said today a political conspiracy was behind the suspension of their leader MP Dinesh Gunawardane and this was an attempt to silence their voices.
Holding a news conference in a vehicle park outside the entrance to Parliament, since they were not permitted to hold the news conference inside Parliament, MP Alahapperuma said the government and the Speaker had robbed the joint opposition of all its rights.
Though the Speakers decision is final, it has not been mentioned anywhere that his decision is always accurate. Today, we have been stripped from our right to hold news briefings inside Parliament. The Government and the Speaker, on behalf of the government, is attempting to suppress the voice of the joint opposition, he said.
He said their group, which consists of 51 MPs, was the second largest faction in Parliament after the United National Party and MP Gunawardane was the group's nominee to attend the party leaders' meetings, Parliament committee meetings and to make statements on behalf of them.
Therefore, the suspension of our leader for a week should not be taken lightly. All the powers enjoyed by us have been stripped away by the Speaker within a matter of minutes. This is an effort to suppress the peoples rights, he said.
He said Mr. Gunawardane was scheduled to speak about the SAITM issue and the Indian fishermen issue in Parliament today.
The suspension has resulted in these issues not being discussed. The Opposition Leader doesnt speak about the main issues faced by the country. We are the ones that highlight these issues and fight on behalf of the people, he said.
Meanwhile, MP Rohitha Abeygunawardena said none of their MPs had entered Parliament through the National List and it was disappointing to witness the suspension of the leader of such a dynamic group.
MPs Vasudeva Nanayakkara, Dilum Amunugama, Keheliya Rambukwella, Vidura Wickramanayake, Prasanna Ranatunga, Sisira Jayakody, Niroshan Premaratne, Indika Anurudda, Johnston Fernando and many others attended the news briefing. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

Sale of loose fags will be banned: Rajitha
	
A memo that seeks approval to ban cigarettes in single sticks will be presented to the Cabinet next week as another step to eliminate the habit of smoking among Sri Lankans and among the youth in particular, Health and Indigenous Medicine Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said yesterday.
We have won the fight against the use of tobacco and smoking but we have a long way to go to fully eliminate smoking in the country. People now think smoking in open is a stigma. That is why they smoke in hiding. The laws banning smoking in public places and the increase of VAT up to 90% on cigarettes have also helped to reduce smoking. Our final target is to compel the people to fully give up smoking. However, Sri Lanka has been commended in many a global forum like the World Health Organization (WHO) for our efforts to control tobacco and smoking, Minister Senaratne added.
Addressing a health camp held at the Ratiyala Maha Vidyalaya at Bulathsinhala, Minister Senaratne went on to say that legislations will also be introduced to order cigarette companies to market cigarettes in plain packets without any attractive features and only with the brand of the cigarette. It would be compulsory to print in colour the pictures of smoking related diseases like lung cancer, oral cancer and respiratory ailments covering 80% of the cover of the cigarette packets.
The fight against corruption is not an easy task. Many powerful companies, drug mafia, doctor mafia and my political opponents have got together to attack me for reducing a particular cancer drug to Rs. 40,000 from Rs. 180,000. A team of oncologists at the National Cancer Institute, Maharagama made a big hue and cry against the use of Russian made cancer drug and insisted that only European drugs must be prescribed to cancer patients despite their huge cost. But I was able to convince them the Russian drug was very effective and of similar quality to the European drug but it is very affordable. I applied the same policy to provide stent to heart patients and contact lenses to eye patients free of charge using the funds saved by breaking the drug mafia, he stressed.

SL marines capable of thwarting any threat from the seas
	
The newly-formed Sri Lanka Navy Marine Battalion, which has mastered amphibious operations, is fully capable to counter any form of threat to Sri Lanka from the sea using the beach areas to their advantage. 
The Sri Lanka Navy formed its first marine battalion comprising six officers and 158 sailors from the Naval Patrolmen Branch having specialised in amphibious warfare. The unit started training under the assistance of the 11th Marine Expeditionary Unit of the United States Marine Corps in November last year. The passing out ceremony was held at the Naval Base SLNS Barana in Mullikulam on February 27 after successfully completing their training. 
The tense situation, which prevailed in the early 1980s called for a group of Naval personnel who were capable of Land Operations. To accomplish this requirement a platoon of naval personnel chosen from the Seaman and Volunteer branches was formed. They were initially deployed for security duties in coastal and land areas.
In a significant feat in SLN history, the first three Naval battalions namely -- Vijayaba, Valagamba and Gajaba were established in 1997. These battalions consisted of 49 officers and 3,000 sailors. After an Army Battalion Training Course, the new combatants were dispatched to engage the enemy in Operation Jayasikuru. 
Soon after the cessation of hostilities in 2009, a certain level of reorganization took place in the NPM Branch made up of more than 5,000 naval personnel, was called for in complying with the core functions and duties of the Sri Lanka Navy. As part of this initiative, the first amphibious Unit comprising 300 naval personnel were initiated into operations after giving them specialized training of 45 days, in the early part of 2016. Subsequently, it was decided to set up a Marine Battalion absorbing officers and sailors from the NPM Branch.  The Marine battalion was established following a visionary concept of navy Commander Vice Admiral Ravindra Wijegunaratne adopting the United States Marine Corps as the model. 

Commander Indika Wijayaratne, the first Commanding Officer of the newly formed Sri Lanka Navy Marine Battalion was educated at the Horana Vidyaratana University College. 
Speaking about the launching of the programme, he said initially volunteers were recruited to the unit. We received about 578 applications from which 177 were selected. The main thing we looked at was physical fitness of the applicants. However, only 164 of those chosen passed out, he said. 
The applicants then underwent a training programme for four months on urban warfare, jungle warfare and later advanced training for three months. Amphibious training was an integral part of the training process. 
The marine training includes endurance and water survival, urban warfare, jungle warfare, amphibious warfare, naval and land indirect fire support and marine tactical operation planning.  The battalion has individuals who are trained in different fields, including doctors and engineers. We are able to deploy the battalion in any emergency situation in Sri Lanka or abroad, Commander Wijayaratne said. This Marine Corps possesses many distinct combatant capabilities and skills and they are perfectly trained to face any enemy attack from the sea and to attack any enemy targets by travelling through sea to land areas. They are highly skilled Marine Corps in urban, forest and river-related operations. 
In addition to being trained to combat sea piracy, the battalion can also function as a peace- keeping team deployed on special missions. There was a need for such a battalion during the war. However, it was the new commander who got us the necessary training to form the battalion. The US marines trained us a lot and were very supportive, Commander Wijayaratne said.

Sri Lankan shopkeeper in UK brutally assaulted by racist teenagers
	
Three teenagers had brutally attacked a Sri Lankan shopkeeper, repeatedly kicking him in the face and screaming Stay down you dirty p***at Norris Green in Liverpool, UK.
The Metro News on Thursday said two 16-year-olds and a 15-year-old had filmed themselves punching, kicking and screaming at 38-year-old Thirkkumaran Siththampalam.
As the victim tried to open his shop at around 8am on December 28 last year, the teenagers had confronted him with a knife, the Liverpool Echo reported.
Brandishing the weapon in his face, they had shouting at him to go home, and that UK was their country.
Mr. Siththampalam was left with a broken jaw and fractured eye sockets after the attack and had to undergo surgery for multiple fractures and have metal plates inserted into his face.

Distressing CCTV footage shown to Liverpool Crown Court showed Mr Sithrampalam trying to knock the knife away with great courage.
In an endeavour to show he was not cowed or intimidated by your conduct, he just continued with his work of opening the shop, Judge Elizabeth Nicholls said.
As he bent down to unlock the padlock  so when he was completely vulnerable and no threat to any of you  one of you kicked him full in the face.
You can see the force of that kick as he fell backwards. The other two of you quickly followed up by kicking him in the head.
All the while, as if this was some form of entertainment to share, with your phone one of you filmed the incident, which is disgraceful and almost the most chilling aspect of this case.
One witness, Matthew McClaren, described how it seemed that p*** was every other word used by the racist gang.
Nicholas Walker, prosecuting, said the victim tried telling them he was not from Pakistan, but that was lost on the males, who continued with their racist abuse.
He said: [Siththampalam] described himself as a man who always supported himself and his family, but the attack made him feel like committing suicide.
Police didnt actually find the teens footage, but they did recover Snapchat conversations in which the gang planned the attack.
The three teenagers admitted inflicting grievous bodily harm with intent.
One of the 16-year-olds and the 15-year-old were given 18-month sentences, and the second 16-year-old was sentenced to two years in a young offenders institution.

TN fishermen demand prosecution of SL navy personnel
	
Tamil Nadu fishermen and family members, who are protesting against Sri Lankan Navy for shooting down an Indian fisherman, demanded the Indian Central government to prosecute the Lankan Navy personnel under the Indian Law, the Indian Express reported on Wednesday.
Citing the case of two Italian marines accused of killing two Kerala fishermen in 2012, many protestors including Ramanathapuram MP A Anwar Raja had appealed to the Centre to prosecute the Lankan navy personnel for the crime.
According to Indian Express, the history of the conflict between Tamil Nadu fishermen and Lankan navy shows that there has been only one instance when a Lankan navy commander was arrested for allegedly killing two fishermen, Susaiappar and Alphonse, in a shootout near the Gulf of Mannar in 1985.
Under pressure from then CM M G Ramachandran, the Congress-government at the Centre directed the Indian Coastal Guard to arrest the commander.
On January 8, 1985, the ICG surrounded the Lankan navy vessel in the high seas before bringing the commander to Mandapam; he was released later, said U Arulanantham, President of Alliance for Release of Innocent Fishermen, adding that it was not known what happened to the case.

Trump-backed Republican healthcare plan
	
(L-R)U.S. House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan, and U.S. Representative Greg Walden hold a news conference on the American Health Care Act.


President Donald Trump on Tuesday endorsed Republican legislation to replace the Obamacare healthcare law but the measure faced a rebellion by conservative groups and lawmakers, complicating its chances for passage in the U.S. Congress.
Republican U.S. House of Representatives leaders on Monday unveiled legislation to do away with Obamacare, eliminating the requirement that most Americans obtain medical insurance and creating a system of tax credits to coax people to purchase private insurance on the open market.
Speaker Paul Ryan said he could guarantee that he had enough votes to win passage of the measure in the House, adding that conservatives should be excited about the plan to repeal and replace Democratic former President Barack Obamas signature domestic policy achievement.
But conservatives slammed the proposal, with Republican Senator Mike Lee calling it exactly the type of back-room dealing and rushed process that we criticized Democrats for.
Trump said the plan was open to negotiation, but said it had already earned support from everybody. Vice President Mike Pence described it as a framework, signalling the measure was far from its final form. Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price called it a work in progress. The proposal represented a key step toward carrying out pledges by Trump and congressional Republicans to dismantle Obamacare.
But lawmakers face pressure from constituents not to throw Americas healthcare system into chaos. Democrats denounced the proposal as taking away health insurance from millions of Americans and benefiting the rich.
Some conservative Republicans complained the bill did not go far enough in removing government from the healthcare industry.
In the Senate, where Republicans can afford to lose only two votes from their razor-thin majority, Republican Senator Rand Paul called the plan Obamacare Lite and said he wanted a repeal-only option.
