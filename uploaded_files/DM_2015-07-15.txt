An exercise where going by the book is not easy!
	
Last week saw the top brass of both main political parties who sat down to finalize nomination lists, struggling to find their way through a labyrinth of last minute pleas, proposals and demands to accommodate certain hopefuls.
for instance, a request that a certain former judiciary chief be given a slot on the Betel leaf national list had sparked off a dispute. Meanwhile, despite continuing pressures, the new Big Boss had put his foot down that the four black sheep Dumi, Saji, Sarana and Mervin were not to be given nominations.
Some party stalwarts had also pointed out that the hearing of a case against Dumi is due to begin on August 1 and giving nomination to him would place the party in an embarrassing position. By the way, the doctor from Kelaniya has not been nominated by either party, they say. Meanwhile, a well-known Buddhist monk who agreed to be on the Betel leaf national list is now having second thoughts, they say.

For them he is still the Head of State here!
	
A group of media personnel called at the diplomatic mission of a powerful country in the city on some important business the other day. The purpose of their visit was well served and they were about to take their leave when two portraits side by side adorning the wall opposite them caught their attention.
	
One portrait was that of the current Head of State of that powerful country and the other was of the former Head of State of our country. Usually a foreign diplomatic mission would have the portrait of their Head of State juxtaposed with that of the incumbent counterpart of the host country on a wall. Bemused over the departure from that practice at this diplomatic mission, one of the journalists asked a diplomat: How is that you have not put up the portrait of our incumbent President
The foreign diplomat only smiled. That was his answer!

He puts off his better known namesakes hour of glory!
	
The much publicized Anuradhapura propaganda rally organized by the Betel leaf rebel group hell-bent on re-enthroning the deposed strongman was suddenly called off triggering much speculation as to the whys and wherefores for the unexpected move.
The hype that the former strongman was to appear for the first time on the stage at this rally gave added significance to this event.  
There were several stories making rounds each referring to some VIP or other as the power behind the cancellation of the event. But it has now transpired that the event was called off on a suggestion by the deposed strongmans namesake running the Elections Department.
The Eco had told the rebel group that he wished they would reconsider holding the proposed rally during the nomination-closing week.
The Betel leaf rebels from Rajarata in particular had reacted with anger to this suggestion. However, the deposed strongman had pacified them saying that it was advisable to listen to the Eco and hold the rally after the nominations hullabaloo.

He wanted to remove them yahapalanya-style!
	
The new Big Boss was having misgivings about the Betel leaf party and the Blue party secretarial ones because of their close ties with the former boss.
Meanwhile, the former Madam had asked him to remove them from their positions. However, the new Big Boss decided to get rid of them yahapalanya-style. He sent for them and asked them to consider resigning from their posts. One of them immediately responded to this courteous request. I am ready to quit at any time. But I am saddled with a vital responsibility to discharge before I leave. That is to unite the party already split into two camps. Once that is done, I will go
The response of the other secretarial one was more or less the same.
Thereupon the new boss had placed the matter on the back burner saying: Okay. Let us take it up later.

Humour on the campaign trail!
	
Numerous anecdotes woven around politicians daily entering the public discourse these days have become a welcome diversion for they add a humorous or a comic touch to the prevailing election fever and excitement in the country, they say.
The controversy over the alleged Treasury Bonds scam that began several weeks ago is still raging and the opposition politicians have discovered this issue is ideal grist to their anti-government propaganda mill. However, most politicians know that this talk about the sale of Treasury bonds and insider trading allegations is Greek to the ordinary people.
Opposition politicians know that the subject goes over the heads of the ordinary people. Yet they seem to presume that the people would come to believe the government has done something terribly wrong if they keep on criticizing it. The government politicians too, not to be outdone, have made it a practice to tell the people some tall story in response.
A certain Deputy one from yahapalanaya hailing from the Puttalam district wanted to defend his party leadership on the bond issue. Addressing a public meeting he said: Friends, the Opposition is using this bandhanagara bandumkara (prison bonds) issue to sling mud at the government. But there had been no fraud or corruption involved in this transaction!
Perhaps, the Deputy may have presumed that it would not matter to his peasant constituents who knew next to nothing about bonds whether he called them bandhanagara (prison) bonds or bhandagara (treasury) bonds!

While claiming that President Maithripala Sirisena acted in the manner the UNP believed, Uva Provincial Council Chief Minister Harin Fernando today said that they were certain of the Presidents promise that he would not support former President Mahinda Rajapaksa at the general elections.
Though we had some doubts, we repeatedly said the President would not support Mahinda Rajapaksa or get on the same stage with Rajapaksa. We are thankful for President Sirisena for keeping his promise, Mr. Fernando said commenting on the speech made by the President on Tuesday. 
Addressing a news conference in Colombo, He said Rajapaksa supporters had kept high hopes and were almost certain that President Sirisena would support Rajapaksa.
We said the Rajapaksa supporters had been excited over nothing. We warned their hopes will shatter eventually. The Baiyo have been defeated today following the speech of President Sirisena, he said.
The President in a special speech on Tuesday said he was against nominating Mr. Rajapaksa for the election and that he would neither back Rajapaksa nor appoint him as the Prime Minister. (Palitha Ariyawansha)

United National Front for Good Governance (UNFGG) was not an alliance formed only against former President Mahinda Rajapaksa but formed to fulfil the political reforms that could not be achieved in previous Parliament, Jathika Hela Urumaya General Secretary Patali Champika Ranawaka said today.
This is not an alliance against Mahinda Rajapaksa. We were prevented from fulfilling certain political reforms, such as the case of appointing members to the Constitutional Council, due to lack of majority in Parliament. So, we decided to form an alliance to fulfil the political reforms promised at the last Presidential election, he said.
Ranawaka said they would take steps to enact the Right to Information Bill and the National Audit Bill immediately after setting up the new government and added that action would be taken against corruption and fraud after setting up the Constitutional Council.
We will release a new manifesto based on the President Maithripala Sirisenas manifesto at the last Presidential Election, he said.
Minister Ranawaka told a news conference that they would not allow certain forces that were attempting to turn back the peoples mandate at the general elections.
We know that Mahinda Rajapaksa would not be satisfied with just an MP post or Premiership. We wanted to fight the force which is raising its head against peoples mandate, he said.(Ajith Siriwardana)WATCH

	He said the President had betrayed the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) and its people by making a speech detrimental to the interests of the party.He added the party had been betrayed in this manner so that the the United National Party (UNP) would benefit from it. (Kelum Bandara)

She went down on her knees praying for nomination!
	
This fair one is already a member of the Western council. Following in the footsteps of her father she sought Betel leaf nomination to enter Diyawanna from the Gampaha district.

	
Alas! The new Big Boss had struck off her name from the nomination list in red. She could not make a plea to the new Boss direct, because she had slammed him at public rallies in the recent past. So she complained to the Betel leaf secretarial one and the rebels she had been running with. And she got an advice from a wise one. You have to cotton up to the new Big Boss. Call on him with a sheaf of betel and worship him in the traditional fashion.
The fair member called on the new boss along with the Betel leaf secretarial one and went on her knees before him, but her name remained struck off up to last Friday, they say.

Vicious circle begins again!
	
Electioneering is a very expensive exercise that calls for liberal spending. However, politicians are not fools to spend their own money on election campaigning. They usually raise slush money for the purpose.
A certain provincial chief who has entered the fray to get back to Diyawanna has already deployed his cronies to solicit contributions to his slush fund using the stick and carrot approach, they say.
This provincial chief, a typical turncoat, has found the affairs he has to preside over quite unwieldy and is keen on continuing his political career in the familiar Diyawanna environment.
The slush fund of the provincial chief has already begun swelling with voluntary contributions from big businessmen and big-time contractors in the province who fear repercussions if they fail to oblige, they say.

	The Malwatte Chapter Mahanayake, the Most Venerable Thibbatuwave Siddartha Sri Sumangala Thera told Western Province Chief Minister Prasanna Ranatunga that, though the Sri Lanka Freedom Party(SLFP) led governments had ruled the country for the last 20 years, no proper development had trickled down to the villages.
	The Mahanayake Thera said the people of Hambantota had pressing needs besides a port and an airport. He said that as a result the people virtually took to the streets to unseat the last government .
	He said, Whenever the SLFP contested in alliance with other parties forgetting its hand symbol, the partys founding policies and principles were compromised over the wishes of others. Therefore, an SLFP-led alliance could not meet the aspirations of the people. The SLFP could have preserved its identity by contesting under its hand symbol. Some forget village development when in power. One need not be in power to serve the village. Mr. Sajith Premadasa did it even without power".
	Mr. Ranatunga said, Nothing was done for the country during the last six months. SLFP-led alliances were in power for the last 20 years, but no development took place during the tenure of former president Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga. (J. A. L. Jayasinghe)
