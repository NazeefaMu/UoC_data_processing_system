Video: Ranil: SL should resolve energy issues
	
	If Sri Lanka expected to become an economic power house in South Asia it must first resolve its political and energy problems in the same manner other Tiger Economies in Asia like Malaysia had addressed those issues in their way to success, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said.
	Addressing Sri Lankas ambitious ten year Energy Sector Development Plan for a Knowledge Based Economy 2015  2025 launched by Power and Energy Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka at the Waters Edge, Battaramulla today, Mr. Wickremesinghe went on to say that politicians must decide whether they all wanted ministerial portfolios or work in a committee system for the good of the people and country.
	Political stability and harmony among political parties is extremely vital for long term economic progress. That is why the government gave ministerial portfolios to a number of SLFP members,he said.
	At a time when peace has been restored after years of conflict, the political stability is also essential to go forward, he added. 
	Food, water and human resources are the integral components for the economic development of any country. Today countries fight for energy, Mr. Wickremesinghe noted.
	Sri Lanka first drew its long term power and energy plan after the introduction of the open economy in 1977 under late President J.R. Jayewardenes rule.
	This plan which was put into operation with the launching of the Accelerated Mahaweli Development Project that constructed a number of major reservoirs and hydro power plants, provided drinking and irrigation water to the millions in the Mahaweli zone and about one third of power requirement of the country, Mr. Wickremesinghe said.
	The US made the Middle East as her main source of energy in the last century. The US was able to take all Middle Eastern countries except Iran into its orbit for the purpose of energy supply. But the power and energy issue remains as one of the major issues in the world and no one has been able to provide a sustainable solution to date to the problem despite many a research and study, Mr. Wickremesinghe emphasized.
	Mr. Wickremesinghe said the fuel prices in the global market had dropped dramatically in the recent past and the Maithripala Sirisena government had passed the benefit to the consumer giving them a huge relief.
	He added that if there were no hedging deal, the government could have given more benefits to the people.
	Sri Lankas ambition is to create a knowledge based development in a society with self-sufficient in power, energy and food and devoid of political upheavals.
	We must be determined to be on par with Malaysia by 2025. If we are not self sufficient in those sectors we would not be able to achieve those targets, Mr. Wickremesinghe said.
	Mr. Wickremesinghe paid tribute to Power and Energy Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka and his staff for the good work done by introducing this 10 year plan for Power and Energy self sufficiency. (Sandun A Jayasekera)

FR against MR refused
	
The Supreme Court today refused Leave to Proceed with a Fundamental Rights violation petition filed by Duminda Nawagamuwa of Frontline Socialist Party against former President Mahinda Rajapaksa and several other respondents over deploying of army personnel during the Presidential Election.
In his petition, Nawagamuwa, who contested the 2015 Presidential Election under the Frontline Socialist Party, stated that the former president Rajapaksa had deployed army personnel between January 3 and Jan. 8 after authorising to issue an order (Gazette) under section 12(1) of the Public Security Ordinance (PSO).
Supreme Court bench comprised Chief Justice K. Sripavan, Justice Sisira de Abrew and Justice Anil Gunaratne.
Commanders of the Three Forces, the Commissioner of Elections, Inspector General of Police and the Attorney General are the other respondents cited in the petition.
Counsel Viran Corea appearing for the petitioner stated that his client reliably learnt that the Election Commissioner, the fifth respondent in the petition, did not make any recommendation to the then President Rajapaksa, under article 104D of the Constitution regarding the deployment of the armed forces for a free and fair election.
Counsel stated the first respondent had issued a Gazette notification dated January 2, 2015 to deploy army personnel in all 25 districts by violating the criteria stipulated in the PSO in a manner ultra vires the PSO and arbitrarily exercised and abused the powers vested in him under the PSO.
The Petitioner maintained that his and the citizens Fundamental Rights guaranteed in the Constitution (Article 12(1)) had been violated owing to the respondents acts.
Meanwhile, retired Attorney General Palitha Fernando PC appearing for the former president stated that both former and incumbent presidents were in the habit of issuing similar orders under Section 12(1) of the Public Security Ordinance on a monthly basis as a requirement of national security.
Mr. Fernando contended that the issuing of the gazette had no impact upon the election. He further affirmed that the executive president has powers to call out army for the maintenance of public order at any part of the country.
Meanwhile, Solicitor General Suhada Gamlath appearing for the Attorney General stated that it was a practice of the executive president deploying armed forces through a Gazette.
He further stated that there is no substantial material to prove that the petitioners fundamental rights had been violated.
The Chief Justice also observed that, no affidavit had not been filed by anyone to prove that their Fundamental Rights had been violated or been prevented from exercising their franchise in the presence of army.
How it affected the voters. What is the vote turn out in the Northern province, the Chief Justice questioned. (Lakmal Sooriyagoda)

JHU challenges the 19th Amendment
	
The Jathika Hela Urumaya (JHU) today filed a petition in the Supreme Court against the proposed 19th Amendment to the Constitution, highlighting that the proposed devolution of powers among the heads of State and Government was vague and the amendment itself was a violation of the election manifesto of President Maithripala Sirisena.
JHU National Organiser and Provincial Councillor Nishantha Sri Warnasinghe filed the petition on behalf of the party, while JHU lawyers M.C. Jayaratne and Tudor Perera appeared for the petitioner.
Mr. Warnasinghe said the manifesto of the President had evidently mentioned that he would not go for any Constitutional amendment which would call for a referendum. 

The latest amendment has proposed to make the Prime Minister the Head of the Government without a referendum. The people elected President Maithripala Sirisena with a mandate to curb the arbitrary powers of the Presidency and not to make the Prime Minister the Head of the Government, which would call for a referendum, he said explaining their stance to challenge the constitutional reforms. 
He said according to one article in the Amendment, the President had been mentioned as the Head of the State as well as the Government but it had also been cited as the Prime Minister is the governments head in another article.

There are a number of contradictory and vague statements in the reforms. The 19th Amendment is also not the one approved by the Cabinet of ministers, he said.
The Jathika Hela Urumaya previously charged the Constitutional reforms were a result of a Constitutional Coup and vowed to defeat the 19th Amendment in its present form. 
 
So far, nine petitions including the petition of the JHU have been filed in the Supreme Court challenging the proposed 19th Amendment to the Constitution. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

Lankan cook jailed over abusing woman at knifepoint
	
	A Sri Lankan cook has been jailed for five years and two months for getting drunk and then forcing himself on his female colleague and raping her at knifepoint at her friends flat in Dubai.
	The 23-year-old Sri Lankan defendant, sexually assaulted the 23-year-old Belarussian woman at knifepoint and issued death threats while he was drunk in May 2014.
	The Dubai Court of First Instance had earlier modified the charges from molestation to rape at knifepoint when W.S. told the bench of judges that he had consensual sex with the victim.
	Presiding judge Ezzat Abdul Lat sentenced W.S. to five years in jail for rape and threat and two months for getting drunk.
	According to Mondays ruling, the accused will be deported following the completion of his punishment.
	The defendant had claimed to court the he had consensual sex with the woman.
	I did not do anything by force or threaten her with a knife. She lied about using force and having sex with her at knifepoint it was consensual sex, he contended in court.
	The cook also admitted that he had consumed alcohol but denied the accusation that he had held the knife in the womans face.
	She is the one who grabbed the knife and held it to my face, W.S. told the court when he defended himself.
	The woman told prosecutors that she was at her friends place using the internet when she was assaulted.
	The defendant knocked on the door and, when I answered it, he asked if my friend was present; he forced his way into the room once he learnt that my friend was out. He pushed me in and closed the door. He grabbed a knife from the kitchen and asked to have sex with me; when I refused, he pushed me down on the couch and held the knife to my face. Do you want me to kill you or rape you he said with the knife placed at my throat. I begged him not to harm me and leave me alone. I offered to give him my jewellery and money to let me go. When I tried to escape, he pulled me by my hair and prevented me, said the woman.
	When I told him that my friends flat-mate might arrive soon, he took out the key from his pocket and put it in the lock. He told me that he wanted to rape me. Then, when the phone rang, I told him that it was the security since they had heard me shouting. Then I opened the door quickly and ran away, the woman claimed.
	Records said the woman informed the buildings security, who reported the matter to the police.
	A Pakistani security guard testified that the woman was in tears when she informed him that she had been sexually assaulted.
	The defendant claimed to me that when he discovered that the woman had been cheating on her boyfriend, she fabricated the molestation charges, the guard said.
	A policeman said the defendant was too drunk to be questioned.
	Mondays ruling remains subject to appeal within 15 days.(Gulf News)

	The march convened by the Inter University Students Federation (IUSF) commenced at the Sri Jayawardenapura University and was to end at the Temple Trees but came to an abrupt halt at the Colpetty junction where the mob of protestors stationed themselves till their demands were met.
	Four students were arrested following a clash with the police and were subsequently released after giving statements to the Colpetty Police, in accordance with the demands of the students.
	There are no discussing of matters with this government. We have tried to communicate these issues several times but they did not respond, so this is the only way to get their attention. This government is no different to the last, the only difference being that the Rajapaksa government took some time to start hitting students, but this government has no reservations as they assaulted students in the first major protest they faced Convener of the Students Union Najith Indika said.
	The students further claimed that their protest was not aimed at demanding luxuries, but rather to negotiate conditions such as unfair fee increments and stated that the indifference of the government was the reason for such a large scale protest.
	Meanwhile one police inspector and six other police constables have been hospitalised during the protest.
	Police said the students behaved violently though five student representatives were given the opportunity to hold discussions with the authorised persons. (Chaturanga Pradeep and Jehan Gunasekara)CLICK HERE TO VIEW PICTURESWATCH
