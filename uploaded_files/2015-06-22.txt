<U+200B>Butter may have been the cause: Cinnamon Grand
	
The Cinnamon Grand Colombo Hotel Management on Monday said an internal investigation report into the food samples of the hotel served during the June 12 event at the Oak room at Cinnamon Grand Hotel where around 20 guests were hospitalised, revealed that the butter served at the function may have been the cause for concern.
Issuing a statement, the management said that, as reported, the hotel has extended its full co-operation to all investigations carried out by the regulatory authorities to ascertain the cause of the complaints.?
The statement also said:
?Immediately following the incident, the Cinnamon Grand sent samples of 67 items of food and drink for expert analysis by an independent and internationally accredited laboratory. A report received today revealed that the butter served at the function may have been the cause for concern. Immediate steps are being taken to further investigate this matter including testing at the level of the supplier and manufacturer.
This matter is of grave concern to us and is receiving our highest priority. Every attempt is being made to ascertain how this occurred and to ensure that an incident of this nature is avoided in the future.?
We have always adhered to the highest standards of food hygiene and environment including the ISO 14001, ISO 22000 and OHSAS 18001 and food hygiene receives our top priority as we serve over 5,500 meals a day at the Cinnamon Grand. This unfortunate incident has resulted in us reassessing all our processes and procedures once again to ensure that our standards remain the highest possible. There has been an immediate implementation of additional measures well above the required ISO standards in processes relating to purchasing, storing and food preparation so as to safeguard against a recurrence of this incident.
"In response to certain questions raised in the media regarding the quality of the air in the Oak Room, the Cinnamon Grand has also obtained external expert reports on the air quality systems in the function rooms which have been certified as compliant with applicable standards and ruled out as the cause of any concern.
The Cinnamon Grand deeply regrets the inconvenience suffered by organizers of this event and the guests who were taken ill at the function on 12th June 2015, ? the statement added.
Around 20 guests were hospitalised on June 12th night after they fell ill following a dinner party held in the Oak room at Cinnamon Grand Hotel in Colombo organised by the Sri Lanka UK society to celebrate British Queen?s birthday.

Dissolution before no-faith motion?
	
Parliament will be dissolved prior to the debate on the no confidence motion already listed on the Order Paper, it is learnt.
Already, three no confidence motions have been handed over against Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake and Public Order and Christian Religious Affairs Minister John Amaratunga.
Of them, the no confidence motion against Mr. Karunanayake has been listed for debate in Parliament on July 6. However, highly placed political sources said yesterday that Parliament would be dissolved before that, making way for a snap general election. Earlier, the President announced that a new Parliament would be in place by September.
The United National Party (UNP), the dominant party of the Government is pressing for the dissolution of Parliament. However, the Opposition, particularly the faction backing former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, is agitating for debates on the no confidence motions. It is learnt that the leaders of the political parties in the Opposition will raise this matter at the Business Committee meeting of Parliament today. Yet, the UNP has even passed a resolution at its Working Committee meeting that all these motions should be withdrawn.
In the meantime, the political parties have already started work on the preparation of nomination lists. The UNP has already received over 15,000 applications from prospective candidates. The party has decided to contest alone at the next election under its elephant symbol. (KB)

Leave no room for UPFA govt. -Ranil
	
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said yesterday that he would not leave room for the establishment of a UPFA government. He said the 100 Day Period mandated by the people had ended at the moment.
Addressing a get together of the United National Party (UNP) at Temple Trees, the Prime Minister said a new stable Parliament is needed to get people?s friendly legislation passed smoothly without any hiccups.
He said the government can no longer go about withdrawing clauses of legislation just to get them passed as it did with the 19th Amendment in the recent past.
He also said Sri Lanka should show the world a stable legislature in order to attract foreign investors. He stressed the need for creating a bright future for the youth and thereby creating new avenues for employment.
UNP General Secretary Kabir Hashim said the present regime is an interim one which was elected for only one hundred days and it is essential to elect a new stable government.
Making a presentation, Mr. Hashim said UNP will be able to get more than 119 seats at the general elections. He recalled that 6.2 million votes which were obtained by President Maithripala Sirisena at the last presidential election would have given an opposition alliance 119 seats at a general election. He claimed that UNP could get this amount of seats at the next general elections.
Deputy Minister of policy planning Dr. Harsha de Silva said people will be able to see clearly that the economy handed over by the previous regime manipulated a bankrupt one.
Uva province Chief Minister Harin Fernando said the only promise which this government failed to keep was to dissolve Parliament on April 23. He said he is willing to dedicate himself for the party as he did in the Uva Provincial Council elections in the recent past. (Yohan Perera)

Video: Hold fresh talks with stakeholders on 20A: JVP
	
The Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) today urged the government to withdraw the gazette notification on the 20th Amendment and have a dialogue with all political parties before preparing a set of fresh legislation.
JVP General Secretary Tilvin Silva told a media briefing that the electoral system proposed in 20A is aimed at abolishing the multi-party system in the country and to replace it with a dual party system.
He warned that such a scenario would result in dire consequences because if the small parties are denied the space to enter parliament they would think of other alternatives to fulfill their aspirations.
Mr. Silva recalled that the 6th Amendment which prevented the Tamil United National Front (TULF) from entering parliament resulted in a civil war while the country was confronted with more conflicts in 1988/89 with the proscription of the JVP.
?In its present form, 20A will allow a handful of aristocratic families to monopolise the political scene and parliament,? he said.
Mr. Silva said there were subtle attempts to prevent parties such as the JVP from highlighting the instances of fraud and corruption carried out by politicians of the two main political parties.
He said parliament should be dissolved if it was not possible to get legislation passed.
Mr. Silva claimed that Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesnghe had assured that the gazette notification on the 20th Amendment would be with drawn if parliament fails to approve it. (Yohan Perera and Sanath Desmond)

Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne?s son challenging former president Mahinda Rajapaksa to contest the general elections from Beliatta is similar to a piglet challenging a lion, UPFA MP Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena said.
He told a news conference that the former president was not bothered about the challenges thrown at him.
?Mr. Rajapaksa is a hero who saved the country. People still respect him. Various people keep challenging him and these challenges are similar one thrown by piglets at a lion. Even King Kosol had a dream of a lion being stalked by jackals. We have piglets instead,? Mr. Abeywardena said.
He said Mr. Rajapaksa doesn?t need special security arrangements, portfolios or any other privileges offered and said the people would hand over the country to him in the near future.
At a meeting held at the Sugathadasa Stadium on Sunday, Health Minister?s son Chathura Senaratne had challenged former the former president to contest the general election from the Beliatta electorate.
He vowed to end the former president?s political career from the very place it began. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

Mahindananda grilled by FCID
	
Former Sports Minister Mahindananda Aluthgamage was quizzed by the Police Financial Crime Investigation Division today over the non-payment of Rs. 39 mn to Lanka Sathosa for purchasing a large consignment of gaming boards during the previous regime.
MP Aluthgamage, who reported to the FCID office in Kollupitiya at 9.00 a.m. was questioned until 12.30 p.m. and a statement was recorded, Police Spokesman ASP Ruwan Gunasekara said.
The former Minister was summoned to obtain his version of the mega deal involving millions of rupees just weeks after the former Secretary to the Ministry of Sports Ret. Maj. Gen. Nanda Mallawarachchi was also quizzed by the FCID.
The FCID says that the Ministry of Sports had ordered Carom and Draughts Boards 14, 000 each in December 2014 through Lanka Sathosa promising to make the payment once the purchase was made.
The goods had been delivered to the Sport Ministry by the Lanka Sathosa, but the payment had not been made to date, according to the FCID.
The Chief Accountant at the Ministry of Sports had refused make the payment for the gaming boards, saying he was not made aware of such a deal by the Ministry officials and no funds had been allocated for such purpose. ?
The Daily Mirror learns that the 28, 000 boards came in 17 container loads, had been distributed among the SLFP electoral organizers in the countrywide.? It is also learnt that part of the consignment was distributed amongst 600 employees of the Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA) attached to SLFP backed trade union ?Nidahas Sevaka Sangamaya?.
The purpose of the purchase of such a large number of gaming boards, had been stated in the Sports Ministry documents, as ?to distribute amongst Sports Clubs in countrywide bid to enhance and develop the Carom and Draughts games.? (KKK)

Maithri to strive for SLFP govt. with MR, CBK
	
President Maitripala Sirisena, addressing the Nuwara Eliya district committee of the SLFP yesterday, said that he would strive to form a government led by the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) and include former presidents Mahinda Rajapaksa and Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga in it.
He said he would team up with all possible forces to form such a government.
He said his team would never leave room for the party to split, and, if any other group tried to split it, the people would take note of it.
He said aggressive behaviour and short political talks with various parties would not help to form a government.
The president said certain elements, who threatened to break ranks with the SLFP-led the UPFA and form different political fronts, were doing a great injustice to the party.
He said votes from the Sinhala Buddhists alone would not suffice for an electoral victory and, therefore, there would be an action plan to win over the Tamil and Muslim voters.
Besides, he said, a programme for containing corruption and fraud was also needed to win the people over to the party at the elections. (Amil Priyankara)

Prasanna Ranatunga doesn't want pavement hawkers
	
	Western Province Chief Minister Prasanna Ranatunga has instructed Western Provincial Council Commissioner Chandrani Samarakoon not to allow pavement hawkers to conduct their businesses on the pavements of Colombo City.
	Colombo Mayor A.J.M.Muzammil had reportedly requested the Police Chief to allow pavement hawkers to sell goods on the pavement.
	The chief minister had written to the commissioner requesting her to intervene in the matter and uphold the ban on pavement hawking.
	He had said that he could not accept the mayor?s decision because, if the authorities permitted the sale of goods on the pavement, it would directly affect the public.
	As he could not allow the public be harmed, the chief minister had directed the commissioner to act on the matter and inform him of the action she had taken within three days.
	The letter also said that Colombo had been named as the first in the list of fastest developed cities in the world, because of the previous regime's efforts to develop the city.
	Former defence secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa had given alternative sites for the pavement hawkers to do their business, and the latest move by the mayor clearly showed that he was just trying to gain political advantage by destroying the Colombo City development project, he had alleged.(Jayantha Samarakoon)

		Despite foreign media reports that claim Sri Lanka will be the first foreign buyer of the multi-role combat aircraft JF-17 Thunder, Sri Lanka Air Force says no decision has been made yet with regard to the procurement of the fighter jet.?
	
	Air Force Spokesperson, Wing Commander Gihan Senevirathne speaking to Daily Mirror said although both Pakistan and China have indicated the availability of the fighter jet and proposals have been submitted on the availability of the aircrafts, SLA has not made any decision on purchasing them.?
	Taiwan based China Times group news website ?Want China Times? however reports Sri Lanka would be the first foreign country to acquire the aircraft also known as the ?Fierce Dragon? or FC1-Xiaolong. This was following a claim made at the 51st Paris Airshow by PAF Sales and Marketing Chairman, Air Commodore Khalid Mahmood that ?a contract has been signed with an Asian country?, which was reported in Pakistan-based new website 92NewsHD last week.?
	'Want China Times' further notes that an order has been made for about 18 ? 24 aircrafts and adds the speculations of Sri Lanka procuring the fighter jet emerged, when a photo of an office of a SLA Commander allegedly revealed a scale model of the JF-17 Thunder. It also quotes Pakistan Air Force stating the delivery of the aircraft to Sri Lanka would commence in 2017.?
	The JF-17 Thunder is a lightweight, single-engine, multi-role combat aircraft developed jointly by the Pakistan Aeronautical Complex and the Chengdu Aircraft Corporation of China. It is deployed for aerial reconnaissance, ground attack and aircraft interception. Its designation ?JF-17? by Pakistan is short for ?Joint Fighter-17? and its alias ?FC-1 Xiaolong? in Chinese stands for ?Fighter China-1 Fierce Dragon?. (Lakna Paranamanna)
