A big bank deposit shrouded in mystery
	
A story has gone viral that a sum of Rs.12.5 million has mysteriously gone into the bank account of the head of a certain state establishment in the country.
The fact that this large amount of money has fattened the bank account of the bigwig soon after he okayed 26 projects related to his establishment has led some people in the know of it to add two and two together.
A member of a profession with close ties to the administration of justice, this bigwig is far from being in financial difficulties. And this big lump sum has gone into his account while there was already a steady flow of money which kept swelling his bank accounts, they say.

A fatherly love that bends tender procedure
	
Charges of nepotism among other forms of corruption against political bigwigs of the previous regime raised much hullabaloo in the country at that time. And the people who set much store by the promise of a yahapalanaya voted the present administration into power.
However, stories are galore that rank corruption continues under the yahapalanaya administration as well.
One such story says that contracts for a number of government projects coming under the purview of a certain senior purohita have been awarded to a firm owned by his own daughter.
The Ministry sources claim that they are following the tender procedure in regard to the awarding of contracts for all construction projects, but it has come to light that practically all contracts for the Ministry projects have gone to the daughters firm.

All educational institutions must be reconciliation centres: MS
	
President Maithripala Sirisena said all educational institutions, including universities and vocational training centres should act as reconciliation centres and reconciliation should be included as a subject in the school curriculum.
Commenting on the clash between two factions of students occurred last week at the University of Jaffna, President Sirisena expressed his deep concerns and added that all our educational institutions should be reformed to prevent recurrence of such incidents in future. 
He expressed these views when declaring open the newly-built Sri Lanka-German Technical Training Institute in Kilinochchi, today. It was built with financial assistance of Germany.
The President recalled that on January 8, 2015 the people elected him as President endorsing his policy statement presented at the election campaign and said he would fulfil all his promises. 
The Sinhala Buddhists will be able to live happily only after the concerns of other communities are resolved and the first step is to acknowledge that the people in the North also have grievances, he said. 
The President requested the so-called heroes who conduct media conferences in the South to visit the North and East to listen and understand the concerns of the people living there. 
With the introduction of a new constitution, we hope to unite the divided communities without in any way dividing the country, he said and added that the emerging new political forces and leaders need to be free of allegations of corruption and misdeeds if they dream of becoming future leaders.
The President extended his warm wishes to German Ambassador Jrgen Morhard who will be leaving Sri Lanka when his tenure ends soon and expressed his gratitude to him for his contribution in obtaining German assistance to Sri Lanka including the construction of the vocational training centre in Kilinochchi. 
President Sirisena planted a Kohomba sapling to mark the opening of the Sri Lanka-German Training Institute before inspecting the Institute. 
Diplomats, Ministers and MPs, including opposition Leader R Sampanthan, Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe, Northern Province Governor Reginald Cooray and many others participated at the event. (Sandun A Jayaskera)

Armed forces will be betrayed through OMP Bill: MR
	
Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa today charged that the Office of Missing Persons (OMP) Bill has many provisions designed to persecute armed forces personnel.
Issuing a statement, he said if the draft legislation becomes a law, every Member of Parliament who votes for it will be held responsible by the people for betraying the country and the armed forces.
In the midst of all the political and economic chaos in the country, the government has placed before parliament draft legislation to set up an OMP. This is one of several institutions to be established to deal with the past in terms of the UNHRC resolution that the Yahapalana government co-sponsored with the Western powers in September last year, he said. 
The Office of Missing Persons Bill has many provisions designed to persecute our armed forces and I wish to highlight some of them as follows.
1. The Office of Missing Persons will not be a part of Sri Lankas State law enforcement and justice system, but an independent body incorporated by parliament which gives its members the power to function outside the normal rules and regulations that guide state institutions.
2. Even though it is described as an office the proposed OMP will be a tribunal for all practical purposes which can examine witnesses, issue summons and hold hearings. Its officers can enter without warrant, at any time of day or night, any police station, prison or military installation and seize any document or object they require for investigations. Anyone who fails or refuses to cooperate with the OMP may be punished for contempt of court.
3. The seven members of the OMP are to have experience in fact finding and expertise in human rights law and international humanitarian law which means that the appointees will for the most part be representatives of Western funded NGOs or those who have worked with Western sponsored international war crimes tribunals.
4. According to Section 21 of the draft legislation, the OMP will have the power to receive funding directly from any foreign source.
5. The OMP, acting on its own, can enter into agreements with foreign persons or organisations concerning its work.
6. The members of the OMP can establish units and divisions and delegate their powers and functions to those entities. They can also appoint and dismiss staff and consultants. It is not specified in the draft law that the members of the OMP have to be Sri Lankans.
7. Complaints can be received not only from relations and friends of missing persons but from any interested party both local and foreign.
8. Government bodies at all levels including the armed forces and intelligence services are mandatorily required to render fullest assistance to the OMP and the provisions of the Official Secrets Act will not apply to the proposed institution.
9. According to Section 12 (c) (iii) the OMP can admit as evidence any statement or material disregarding the criteria laid down in the Evidence Ordinance.
10. The provisions of the Right to Information Act will not apply to the work of the OMP. No court, not even the Supreme Court can order any officer of the OMP to submit to courts any material communicated to him in confidence.
The foregoing makes it clear that this Office of Missing Persons is meant to be an integral part of the judicial mechanism to deal with allegations of war crimes that the government has undertaken to establish. If this draft legislation becomes law, every Member of Parliament who votes for it will be held responsible by the people for betraying the country and the armed forces, Mr. Rajapaksa said.

Chinas Hainan frontrunner for SriLankan: sources
	
On a quest to find a strategic investor to help revive the loss-making national carrier, it is learnt that the government is close to finding a prospective partner to manage SriLankan Airlines.
Informed sources told Mirror Business that the firm likely to come on board to manage the debt-laden carrier would be Chinas largest privately-owned air transport firm, Hainan Airlines Company Limited (HNA).
HNA is the fourth-largest airline in terms of fleet size in China and operates scheduled domestic and international services on 500 routes from Hainan and nine locations on the mainland, as well as charter services.
Its main base is Haikou Meilan International Airport with a hub at Beijing Capital International Airport and several focus cities.
It is one of eight airlines, all based in Asia, rated as five-star by Skytrax, along with All Nippon Airways, Asiana Airlines, Cathay Pacific, EVA Air, Garuda Indonesia, Qatar Airways, and Singapore Airlines.
When contacted, Deputy Minister of Public Enterprise Development Eran Wickramaratne said the government had so far received several informal inquiries about SriLankan but stopped short of giving out any specific names.
He also said his ministry was expecting a report from the mangers that were mandated to find a partner for SriLankan, once the deadline for applications expires.
The government recently called offers from interested investors to take over an equity stake in SriLankan Airlines. Appointed as transaction advisors were BNP Paribas and KPMG.
An advertisement by NSB Fund Management, lead managers to the deal, earlier this month said the invitations for expressions of interest (EOI) would be available from 27 July for a non-refundable fee of US $ 5000, whereas offers would close on 24 August.
Officials from SriLankan Airlines earlier had said that by end September, a suitable partner would have been picked.
In an effort to be an attractive venture the entity has kicked off a restructuring programme where it has focused on cutting down operational costs.
While the airline is looking at means to trim its human resources, it has already started cutting loss making routes to Europe and increased focus on India and the Far East.
In March this year the government announced it was seeking foreign assistance to turnaround the SriLankan.
The statement was made shortly the government having acknowledged that the national airline cannot payback its debt mounting over US $ 1 billion. In addition to the debt pile, SriLankan has accumulated losses of Rs.128 billion (US $ 872 million). (Shabiya Ali Ahlam)

CMC to take legal action against 800 Pettah vendors for non-payment
	
Taking a new turn on the ongoing saga between vendors in Bodhiraja Mawatha and Fifth Street in Pettah and the Colombo Municipality, the Treasurer of the Colombo Municipality K.D.Chitrapala today said they had decided to take legal actions against 831 vendors who have not paid initial deposits and lease payments.
Among the 831 vendors, there are 531 vendors from the Fifth Street in Pettah and the rest (300) are in business in Bodhiraja Mawatha, Pettah.
The vendors who were first evicted from the streets of Pettah were provided with the alternative place of business by the Municipality for a nominal lease payment.
However, the municipality said that close to Rs. 107 million, Rs. 3 million of which was to be paid to the state as VAT, was defaulted by more than 800 vendors who used the premises for business.
CMC Treasurer K.D.Chitrapala told the Daily Mirror that they made the decision regarding legal actions against them because the vendors did not settle the payments even after the Municipality had issued a final notice for vendors to pay up.
He said Colombo Mayor A. J. M Muzammil directed immediate legal action against those who have not paid. The proposal was presented to the Committee and the approval was also given to go ahead with legal action, he said.
According to him, currently the Legal Activities Branch of the CMC is in the process of preparing necessary documents to be produced to Court.
In the first phase, we will file cases against some twenty five vendors in Colombo Fort Magistrates Court for avoiding the payments. After that, all other 806 vendors will be taken to courts, he said.
Colombo Mayor, A. J. M Muzzamil has directed authorities to take legal action against those who have sold or rented out their stalls to third parties.
"I sent them letters demanding complete payment. Even the initial deposits have not been paid by some vendors from 2010, though the CMC had sent them letters as well as officers reminding vendors," Chithrapala said.
"We gave them too many chances. These vendors pay thousands daily to their organizations though they deny it. But, they are not paying their legal lease payments to the CMC. I have evidence to prove this, he said.
The Treasurer further stated that renting or selling stalls without the permission of CMC was illegal. A survey found that 392 stall have been sublet or sold out to other parties in Bodhiraja Mawatha market place.
The real owners of the stall were making thousands a day at home by controlling the market place and also enjoying the benefits provided to traders, Chithrapala said. (Piyumi Fonseka)

While admitting in Parliament today that 45 people were appointed as consultants of the Southern Transport Development Project of the Road Development Authority on a monthly payment of Rs.65,000 each, Higher Education Minister Lakshman Kiriella said the government should look after those who ensured a thumping electoral victory from the Kandy district at the two elections.
The Minister who is also the Leader of the House said this in response to a question asked by JVP MP Nalinda Jayatissa.
In a supplementary question based on the minister's response, he said he had received a list of 56 such appointments made by the minister including a Buddhist monk named Ven. Wattapolla Rahula Thera.
I dont know what a Buddhist monk has to do with road development projects, Dr. Jayatissa said. Detailing the qualifications of such appointees, he said some had only passed the GCE Ordinary Level Examination.
Some have cited their position as the opposition leaders of various local bodies such as the highest qualification to apply for this post, he said and added that the appointment of political henchmen did not gel with the concept of good governance.
The minister responded saying the government won the Kandy district with a majority of 81,000 votes at the presidential election and with a majority of 131,000 votes at the parliamentary election.
As a result, we should care for those who ensured such a huge victory, he said and added that 250 such appointments had been made during the previous regime, but none had questioned those appointments.(Kelum Bandara and Yohan Perera)

Controversial Coal Deal: SOC summons AG
	
Auditor General Gamini Wijesinghe has been summoned to Parliament today to testify on the alleged coal purchasing deal which is alleged to have caused the government to incur a loss of Rs.1.8 billion, informed sources said.
MP Nalin Bandara Jayamaha a member of the Parliament Sectoral Oversight Committee (SOC) on Power and Energy told Daily Mirror that the Committee had summoned Mr. Wijesinghe today to testify on the matter.
He said officials of the Ministry of Power and Energy, Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) and the coal supplying companies have been summon by the oversight committee to determine as to what had really happened.
Mr Jayamaha had said the Auditor General had got it wrong when he said the Government had lost Rs.1.8 billion. He said the price paid for a metric ton of coal is only US$ 51 and not US$58 as mentioned in the auditor generals report. He said US$58 was an index price which was decided at the time the tenders were called for the purchase of coal in 2015.
Mr. Jayamaha said the parties usually agree on an index price at the time the tenders were called and later revise the price depending on the global price of coal on the day an order is made and that the price of coal was $51 on the day the order was placed.
Meanwhile, the special committee appointed by the Government is also conducting investigations. (Yohan Perera)

Finance Minister vows to introduce new Customs Bill
	
Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake yesterday vowed to proceed with the proposed Customs Bill despite objections from some quarters.
He said only a white paper had been presented for discussion on the proposed legislation. He said the Customs Ordinance was introduced in 1864 and that such antiquated laws should be amended to cope up with the present situation.
The minister said however there were crooks who opposed any changes to this archaic law and regretted moves by some of those in authority. He said that he regretted that some people in authority were also critical of the move while being unaware of the proper facts.
There is only a white paper. There is no Bill yet. We are open for suggestions, he said.
Earlier, trade unions attached to the Sri Lanka Customs urged the government not to proceed with the proposed legislation. They also met religious dignitaries and asked them to prevail upon the Government to stop going ahead with the new Bill. (Kelum Bandara)

Responding to a question by a journalist outside the Colombo National Hospital he said at least five groups are holding the reins of the country.
President Maithripala Sirisena thinks its he who runs the country and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe thinks its him. Former president Chandrika Kumaratunga thinks it's her. Similarly, India thinks they are the true leaders of Sri Lanka as it helped the government to come into power while the US also thinks they are the leaders here, Mr. Gammanpila said.
He said this after visiting the student who was injured in the Jaffna University clash on Saturday. Commenting on the clash he said the governments approach to establish reconciliation had proved futile and therefore the leaders should reconsider their approach and techniques.

Swiss AG indicts 13 LTTE supporters
	
Switzerlands Attorney General (AG) has indicted 13 people associated with the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) for providing financial support to the organisation via a sophisticated microcredit system, the swissinfo.ch reported today.
The 13 suspects, who come from Switzerland, Germany and Sri Lanka, have been charged with supporting or being members of a criminal organisation, fraud, false certification and money laundering.
As the Office of the Attorney General of Switzerland announced on Wednesday, the LTTE was acting through a Swiss offshoot known as the World Tamil Coordinating Committee (WTCC).
During the continuing civil war in Sri Lanka, the LTTEs financial needs increased considerably. According to the attorney generals office, LTTE leaders in Switzerland devised and implemented a systematic and rapid method for obtaining money from the Tamil diaspora in Switzerland. They reportedly raised around $15.2 million.The LTTE remained an anonymous participant in the process by acting through the WTCC.
The mechanism for providing financial support to the LTTE essentially involved inducing members of the Tamil Diaspora in Switzerland, who apparently had no links with each other, to enter into microcredit contracts in their own names but in a fiduciary capacity, and then to pass on the funds to the WTCC, the attorney generals office said.
A Swiss bank in canton Zurich had provided microcredits of up to Swiss franc (CHF) 100,000. In order to obtain the microcredits, two financial intermediaries prepared forged salary statements. Couriers carried cash to Singapore and Dubai. Each month, up to CHF1 million flowed abroad and was used to buy weapons.
The LTTEs funding system collapsed in 2009, following the organisations military defeat, and the diaspora community stopped making the loan payments, explained the attorney generals office.
At the main hearing before the Federal Criminal Court, the attorney generals office will submit its proposals for the penalties to be imposed on the 13 accused. By filing the indictment, the court will be responsible for providing further information.
