Confusion hypocrisy and double standards - EDITORIAL
	
he continuing or unfolding Political-cum-Constitutional drama, which commenced with President Sirisenas abrupt appointment of Mahinda Rajapaksa as Prime Minister, even before letting the then sitting incumbent know of his dismissal, smells of petty one-upmanship. It has left the country in turmoil and its citizens polarised.
The tension arising between supporters of the two claimants to the seat of PM has spilt over into the streets.
Already one individual has been fatally shot and two others injured by Police shooting -victims to the vagaries of politicians reckless behaviour.
Unruly elements have surrounded Government institutions and prevented state officials carrying out their legitimate functions.
While violence has been minimal except for the fatal shooting of an individual and the wounding of two others in the shooting incident, we cannot be happy with the way and manner events are unfolding.
It is common knowledge that horse-trading is taking place even while this editorial is being writ. The going price we are told, by the very politicians who are being bought and sold like chunks of beef at a butcher shop is rupees five-hundred million per member.
Ordinary Sri Lankans are beginning to view politicians as the scum of the earth and this is bad for democracy as a whole, as it erodes, especially, young peoples faith in the Democratic and Parliamentary System. There is, therefore, an increasing need to end the worsening situation within the Parliamentary System.
If the ongoing imbroglio is allowed to spiral out of control it could once again lead young people to contemplate extra-Parliamentary means to bring about change.
While to date acts of physical violence have been minimal, the international community led by the UK and the US have taken umbrage at ongoing events.
The US, the UK and the EU have issued travel advisories to their citizens planning to visit Sri Lanka, warning of the dangerous situation prevailing.
It is also rather strange and downright hypocritical, to hear and see these countries issuing travel warnings on Sri Lanka when the atmospheres in the UK, EU and the US are volatile and toxic.
It was only last week we read in the media and saw images of US-styled Klansmen surrounding a Bangladeshi house of prayer and worship in the UK demanding it is closed or else.
During the past year according to the Guardian, in 2018 alone there have been over 50 killings of main ly people of non-white skin and/or from a foreign background in London!
In the period March 2017 and February 2018, 35 people died and 267 others were injured in the UK from terrorist attacks.
In the US, no lesser person than President Trump himself is inflaming racial hatred, raising the bogeyman of persons he refers to as aliens. That is people not his colour and not US-born.
Just two days ago the US President called on US military personnel to open fire on an -immigrant caravan-crowds of people from the Latin American countries, who are seeking asylum in the US if they attempt to forcibly cross the border or throw stones at US military personnel blocking their entry into the US.
This even though the US Constitution clearly forbids US Governments from refusing entry to asylum seekers.
Violence in the US is also on the rise. According to the Business Insider of 29 October 2018, there have been 297 mass shootings in the US this year alone!
But no travel warnings have been issued by the UK, EU or NATO countries on travel to the US.
While the double standards of the West are unethical and condemnable, we call on our politicians -none of whom can be referred to as statesman- to bring an end to the internal turmoil now wracking our country and endangering the incipient tourist and export-oriented industries.
Pundits are already predicting Sri Lanka stands in danger of losing many trading benefits -including the GSP benefits.
The current impasse is of our own making. It is time our politicians if they have even a smattering of care for the country they claim to give leadership to; to for once, put country before self, and stop misquoting the Constitution to fulfil personal agendas.

Disruption and Consolidation of Power From the outset-including after the Parliamentary Elections -t
	

he power grab and subsequent events over the last ten days are but the culmination of a plan of action that Mahinda Rajapaksa put into place following his defeat at the Presidential and Parliamentary Elections of 2015. The strategy was one of disruption of the Sirisena-Wickremesinghe Government and power consolidation through mobilisation and elections, including a major victory at the local government elections in February this year.
The success of Rajapaksas strategy is also, thanks to the failures of the Sirisena-Wickremesinghe Government, within a political environment susceptible to and set up for disruption.
From the outset, and including after the Parliamentary Elections of August 2015, the Unity Government has disregarded its promises to the public.
Over the last four years, the trade and financial liberalisation policies carried forward by the Rajapaksa regime were accelerated, placing the national economy and working peoples lives in a precarious situation.
Instead of putting forward a coherent political vision towards strengthening the democratic body politic of State and society by, for example through Constitutional reform, the political bickering between the Wickremesinghe led UNP and Sirisenas faction of the SLFP led to rising political instability.
The economic troubles and the political instability constituting the crisis facing the country today has many aspects. I focus here on three facets of this crisis, particularly shrinking democratic space, ethnic polarisation and economic dispossession.
Democratic space
Regardless of the criticisms, one may have of the Sirisena-Wickremesinghe Government from 2015 to its recent collapse, one undeniable characteristic of this period was the tremendous opening of democratic space.
The decades of war and the authoritarian post-war years under Rajapaksa undermined freedoms of expression and association. Protests were brutally suppressed, dissent was silenced and the media came under attack, all amidst a climate of fear.
Although student and trade union protests continued to be dealt with harshly by the Sirisena-Wickremesinghe Government, the fear of extrajudicial means of repression had, for the most part, receded in recent years.
By democratic space, I mean the political environment that is conducive and enabling of peoples direct participation and action, including struggles and protests.
In the North and East, the opening of democratic space in January 2015 was akin to night and day.
From militarised surveillance where people felt wary to even speak in small meetings, the climate of fear dramatically lifted and protests and struggles emerged on a range of issues.
While the Government may not have addressed the demands of such struggles, the right to protest has contributed greatly to the security and dignity of the minorities in the country.
The question is whether another period of Rajapaksa rule may lead to the shutting down of this democratic space.
Inter-ethnic relations
It was the Tamil communities in the war-torn regions and the Muslim communities throughout the country that faced the brunt of repression under the Rajapaksa regime.
A Constitutional political solution was dismissed by the Rajapaksas claiming that mega development was the answer to the grievances of the minorities.
State power was usurped by the Executive Presidency with the passing of the 18th Amendment even as the militarization of civil administration, particularly governance of the war-torn regions and urban development throughout the country came under the security apparatuses. Instead of fostering co-existence in the post-war environment, communities were polarised to consolidate the power of the Rajapaksa regime.
An ideological war was initiated against the Muslim community making them the scapegoats for economic woes. Violence including riots was instigated against Muslim shops and businesses. Drawing on global and regional Islamophobia, the crass attacks placed the Muslim community in a terrible state of fear. While the regime change in 2015 did not succeed in addressing the grievances of the minorities and did not mean an end towards the violence against Muslims, at the very least there was recognition of addressing such concerns at the policy level. The efforts towards drafting a new Constitution and the various reconciliation mechanisms set a trajectory conducive for dialogue. In this context, the stalling Constitutional reform process and meagre progress in addressing the legacy of war-time abuses as well as the failure to prevent more recent anti-Muslim violence, have been both causes and symptoms of increasing ethnic polarisation over the last two years.
The Joint Opposition led by Rajapaksa in no small measure contributed to such polarisation, and the logical question to ask is how their divisive nationalist politics will impact minorities if they consolidate state power.
Economic problems
The political crisis that we face today is very much linked to the economic instability and crisis that has troubled the country over recent months but has a longer trajectory spanning a few decades.
The broader economic policies taken forward by the Sirisena-Wickremesinghe Government were not very different from the Rajapaksa Government. Urban development concentrated in Colombo, plans for an international financial centre, financialised sovereign loans, mega development projects with Chinese support and even free trade agreements, particularly with India, were all initiated under the Rajapaksa Government.
Rising indebtedness as a result of financialisation, ruined livelihoods due to neglect of agriculture and fisheries, investment in large infrastructure over small industries, have all contributed to the dispossession of the working people. Their cost of living has been rising while incomes have fallen with many out of work.
In the past, both Governments have sought the support of voters through populist measures prior to elections. As we approach a year of elections, the UNPs Colombo-centred view of the economy and the anti-incumbent mood among the population are likely to translate into greater support for Rajapaksa who is pledging to solve the economic problems of the people.

"The economy, which should be critically debated in the run-up to the next round of elections, will once again be displaced by the recent manoeuvre, where the upcoming provincial, general and presidential elections, are likely to focus on personalities, betrayal and corruption"


This will not happen, as Rajapaksas economic policies are no different in substance, with the continuation of Sri Lankas neoliberal integration with global markets and finance capital.
The 2015 election ousted the Rajapaksa regime through a protest vote. The election debate then focused on challenging authoritarianism did not seriously address economic concerns, and reduced any discussion of the economy to corruption and nepotism.
The economy, which should be critically debated in the run-up to the next round of elections, will once again be displaced by the recent manoeuvre, where the upcoming Provincial, Parliamentary and Presidential Elections, are likely to focus on personalities, betrayal and corruption.
In the near term, the Programme for Economic Revival (2 November 2018), released by the Finance Ministry under its new leadership, outlines measures including subsidies and tax relief that will be provided at the behest of President Sirisena and newly appointed Finance Minister Rajapaksa.
These measures stick to IMF dictates and aim to boost investor confidence through measures of fiscal consolidation. They will merely disrupt ongoing development projects and transfer capital expenditure allocated in the 2018 Budget towards populist measures to shore up support.
Instability and crisis will be costly for the economy, and in the absence of a credible economic vision,those costs will only be transferred to the people.
State power consolidation under a Rajapaksa regime will make it much easier to implement Neoliberal Policies that require repressive State power, including those of further financialisation and privatisation, than was for the weak Sirisena-Wickremesinghe coalition government.
Progressive path
As the tussle for power continues with forces aligned to Wickremesinghe, Rajapaksa and Sirisena, what would a progressive path of engagement look like
While we all know the limitations of our parliamentarians who are often up for sale, the parliament should be reconvened immediately. Parliament is often the first line of defence before peoples rights are abused, and the manoeuvre to hand Rajapaksa a government needs to be challenged in Parliament and on the streets.
For those who say that Rajapaksa will be different this time around, there is nothing to suggest this given his leadership of the Joint Opposition and the absence of self-criticism about his authoritarian stint in power.
In fact, the deterioration of our political culture including in parliament and the politicisation of state institutions to a large measure are consequences of the decade-long rule of the authoritarian Rajapaksa regime.
Wickremesinghe has failed as Prime Minister consistently, from his short stint in power that ended in 2003 to the current term. His politics and policies only elicit popular contempt.
It is high time the UNP holds its leadership responsible for its failures and prepares a leadership capable of dealing with the worrying times ahead.
The TNA led by Sampanthan abdicated its role as formal Opposition when it failed to oppose the attacks on the student movement and trade union struggles over the last few years. The TNA itself and its constituencies are facing the prospect of fragmentation, with its leadership done little to mobilise its base in recent times.
Former Chief Minister of the Northern Province C.V. Wigneswaran and other narrow Tamil nationalist forces are gleeful at the current crisis, as their fortunes depend on further ethnic polarisation, but their suicidal politics drawing on the legacy of the LTTE will only setback the Tamil community.
Presidente Sirisena has come a full circle from challenging Rajapaksa in 2015 to delivering him a government.

"For those who say that Rajapaksa will be different this time around, there is nothing to suggest this given his leadership of the Joint Opposition and the absence of self-criticism about his authoritarian stint in power. In fact, the deterioration of our political culture including in parliament and the politicisation of state institutions to a large measure are consequences of the decade-long rule of the authoritarian Rajapaksa regime"
His role and power are likely to be drastically reduced as the unified SLFP consolidates under Rajapaksa and he increasingly faces the ire of those opposed to Rajapaksa. History will judge Sirisena harshly for this manoeuvre, especially for letting down his mandate from the people for a democratic change.
The citizenry cannot depend on any of these personalities and for that matter their party machines, which have been self-serving.
Nor are international actors sitting on their high horses with their share of dirt in their stables going to provide an answer. If anything, a national political crisis only enables international actors to manipulate the country. The international actors who seem so opposed to Rajapaksa today will fall in line if he consolidates power and toes the Neoliberal line.
Moreover, their visible opposition to Rajapaksa at this critical juncture will only strengthen his Sinhala-Buddhist Nationalist base, who claim to save the nation.
This is where the media get it so wrongthe current moment cannot be reduced to the acts of national leaders and international actors.
Against the odds, it is once again time to grapple with difficult questions. We need to ensure that the space for democracy is not shut down, and find avenues to expand democratic space including through substantive debates about the state and the uses of state power.
Rebuilding fragile inter-ethnic relations are crucial even as we challenge the divisive politics of ethnic polarisation. Finally, a meaningful economic vision on the principles of equality and justice for the people who are still looking for relief in the North and South is urgent. If these concerns are raised in broad-based campaigns by peoples movements, in national debates and the upcoming elections, they may provide critical resistance to the consolidation of State power by a repressive regime.

Expo Global Distribution Centre (EGDC) announces re-branding to EFL Global Freeport
	
Driving further consolidation of its end-to-end supply chain solutions, EFL (Expolanka Freight) announced a rebranding of its Freeport operations under the new moniker: EFL Global Freeport (Pvt) Ltd.
Representing the first private sector enterprise to be granted a license to operate as a Freeport in Sri Lanka, the Freeports recent rebranding flows from a continuous effort to maintain brand consistency across the companys global footprint of 18 countries and optimize its reach with the right mix of local and international clients capable of elevating Sri Lankas position as a global logistics hub in the South Asian region.
The companys Japanese strategic partners, SG Holdings Groups Chairman, Eiichi Kuriwada and EFL Founder and President Mr. Hanif Yusoof did the honors at a special ceremony held to mark this important milestone in the organizations increasingly prosperous journey. In addition, Chairman of Expolanka Holdings PLC Naosuke Kawasaki and other Senior Personnel alongside representative from SG Holdings attended this function.
Mr. Hanif Yusoof stated that, Sri Lanka remains one of the most uniquely and advantageously positioned countries in the world with regards to the logistics trade.

With our rebranding as the EFL Freeport, we aim to convey a simple message to our local and international clientele: namely, that Sri Lanka is open for business. By offering a complete suite of services to simplify supply chain complexities within a cost and time efficient manner, we are confident that the newly rebranded EFL Freeport will serve as a catalyst for exponential growth in the logistics industry for years to come.
Despite the significant rebranding, the companys composition and strategy of personalized solutions will remain unchanged with the Freeport continuing to offer a wide range of international logistics services and value addition activities to both local BOI companies and foreign customers.

While condemning the statement issued by Speaker Karu Jayasuriya stating that he would have to continue with the previous statuses in Parliament until a clear majority was shown in Parliament, the Government today requested the Speaker to withdraw it saying that it was personal and a politically driven statement.
Making such a biased statement is unconstitutional and illegal. Decision on certain matters have to be taken according o the Constitution. The Speaker has no right to decide, who should be the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister should be appointed by the President, Foreign Minister Sarath Amunugama said.
He said Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa had been appointed by the President according to the Constitution and added that proroguing of the Parliament could also be done only by the President.
Former Deputy Speaker Thilanga Sumathipala said the Speaker had no provision to take a stance like this and requested him to withdraw the statement.
He said it was the Speaker who was trying to destabilize the country and said the Speaker should take the responsibility.

Heavy showers exceeding 100mm are forecasted in the coming days as a result of a low pressure area which is likely to develop over Bay of Bengal, the Disaster Management Centre (DMC) said today.
DMC which quoted the Department of Meteorology said the depression is likely to move west-northwestwards across southwest Bay of Bengal, Sri Lanka and Gulf of Mannar area during the coming days.
Due to this situation the showery condition is expected to enhance over the island, particularly in the Eastern, North-central, Northern, Uva and Southern provinces. Cloudy skies can be expected over the island, the forecast said.
General public, Naval and fishing communities were requested to be attentive about advisories issued by the Department of Meteorology in this regard.
Heavy falls were expected at some places in the Uva, Southern and Central provinces and in Batticaloa, Ampara and Polonnaruwa districts. (Yohan Perera)

I appointed MR as Premier after Karu and Sajith refused: MS
	
President Maithripala Sirisena said today that he offered the premiership to Speaker Karu Jayasuriya first and then to UNP Deputy Leader Sajith Premadasa before considering former President Mahinda Rajapaksa for the post of Prime Minister.
Addressing a public rally named Rata Surakina Jana Mahimaya, he said the UNP MPs who met him during the past few days asked him why Mr. Rajapaksa was appointed the Prime Minister contrary to the aspirations of UNPers as they were the ones who installed him as the president in 2015.
For the first time in four years, he appeared on the same stage with Mr. Mahinda Rajapaksa yesterday at this rally in Battaramulla.
He said he met the Speaker eight months ago and insisted that he take over premiership.
I pleaded with him for several days to become the Prime Minister because I could no longer work with Mr. Ranil Wickremesinghe as the Prime Minister. But, he declined to accept the post citing his inability to pose a challenge to Mr. Wickremesinghe, the President said.
He said he approached Mr. Premadasa two months ago and offered the premiership to him but Mr. Premadasa also declined to accept it citing his inability to stand up to the leadership of Mr. Wickremesinghe.
By sacking Mr. Wickremesinghe from office, he said he not only brought about a change of personalities but also a political programme that was attuned to the interests of external forces and against the cultural ethos of Sri Lanka.
The President said he appointed Mr. Rajapaksa as Prime Minister as he was familiar with the local value system and formidable enough to outsmart Mr. Wickremesinghe in politics.
Commenting on the government's activities during the past three years, he said the decisions were taken by a 'Samanala gang' not by the Cabinet. He said the new government had secured the required simple majority of 113 MPs to govern the country and asked Speaker Karu Jayasuriya to cooperate with him. Also, he said he sacked Mr. Wickremesinghe from office through lawful means and asked the Speaker to respect his decision.
"I never take my decisions single handedly. I consulted all concerned. The removal of the Prime Minister and the appointment of Mr. Rajapaksa were done lawfully. If there is anyone grieved by it, the Supreme Court can be petitioned," he said.
The President said new Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa, upon assumption of duties, met the Mahayanayake Theras and the Cardinal, worshiped at Jayasirimaha Bodhi and Dalada Maligawa whereas Mr. Wickremesinghe was worshiping foreign ambassadors. The President vowed not to take a step back from the action he had taken. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

JLL comments on the Western Region Megapolis Masterplans sustainability and progress
	
In its monthly Compass bulletin, real estate consultancy Jones Lang Lasalle examined the relevance of the Western Region Megapolis Masterplan to Sri Lankas ambitions of improving citizen wealth and rapid economic growth. The statement also questioned the sporadic nature of the progress reported by the project since March 2017, noting that a cornerstone of the governments modernization policy must be more frequently communicated to the public.
The Western Megapolis Development Plan was first conceptualized in 1998 by the newly established Urban Development Authority, leading to a first version in 2002. The newest version of this plan was revealed in January 2016 under the newly established coalition government at the time, as the Western Region Megapolis Masterplan. This was pitched, and has since been floated, as a cornerstone of the governments strategy to bring Sri Lanka to upper middle and then high-income status. This ambitious plan sets targets of tripling per-capita income in the western region to USD 12,000 by 2020, creating 500,000 jobs, and making the western region one of the 10 most liveable cities in Asia to reverse current brain drain trends.
For this ambition two transformations are necessary, notes JLL. Spatial transformation of the urban western region is one, the national economys structural transformation is another. The plan flagged three broad national issues: issues arising from congestion pressures being exerted on urban infrastructure, services and amenities due to messy urbanization; weak enabling environment to propel Sri Lanka to high-income status; and the lack of a framework to harness the benefits of a knowledge based, innovation driven economic environment, characterized by the new industrial revolution and smart cities. The plan aimed to address all these weaknesses.
There are other institutional challenges to be overcome as well. A lack of appropriate land use policy, ad-hoc development and planning, a mono-centric urban spatial structure, and a poor public transportation system are a few of these challenges that the plan must maneuver.
Transforming the western region into a world class metropolis in such sensitive times brings immense challenges in delivering the high-level goals of diversity, inclusivity and sustainability that the plan promises, says Steven Mayes, Managing Director of JLL Lanka (Pvt) Ltd. If this wish list is to be accomplished then infrastructure and public transformation will be key. If we look at public transport, developing the planned LRT (Light Rail Transit) system will be paramount. Mr Mayes also noted that the Government of Sri Lanka must carefully examine the robustness of the PPP model to underwrite the additional capital sums necessary to upgrade existing bus and rail systems and to initiate the water bus transport system, utilizing existing waterways, envisaged in the master plan.
JLL also highlighted the importance of regularly updating the news portals used by the government with details on the progress of the Megapolis plan. The current website- www.megapolis.gov.lk -reveals no new entries since June 2017, while the consultations portal has not been updated since March 2017. The sustainability of this project will also depend to a significant extent on public engagement and support- communicating what the progress is, even if it is minor, will help to build ownership and awareness. More importantly its the governments duty to inform the public of the progress- or lack of- that is being made with one of Sri Lankas most ambitious development plans in recent history.

JVP leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake told a news conference that the President prorogued Parliament to buy time to secure a majority in parliament by winning over opposition members to their side using black money.
He said a majority of members in parliament had requested the Speaker in writing to convene parliament at the earliest and added that the Speaker should convene Parliament using the powers vested in him.
Mr. Dissanayake said they were ready to defeat this political coup in parliament.
We will call for a division to defeat even the Presidents policy speech on the day Parliament is convened, he said and added that his party would support any resolution brought against the unconstitutional appointments made by the present government and however they would not support any move to select people for the Premiership.

The 25-year-old Sri Lankan University student had been released on bail, after an expert found the sole piece of evidence couldn't be connected to him, according to foreign media reports.
Mr. Nizamdeen was arrested in August after a colleague found a notebook allegedly containing details of plans to kill Malcolm Turnbull and his former Deputy Julie Bishop.
He spent four weeks in jail facing a terror charge, however, his family and relatives have maintained he was innocent.
"The prosecution has become aware that an expert handwriting examiner found an inconclusive result on the relevant entries contained in the notebook," prosecutor Christina Choi told the Central Local Court in Sydney.

118 MPs still oppose new Prime Minister: Harin
	
A majority of 118 members of Parliament still oppose the appointment of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa as the new Prime Minister despite the crossing over of UNP MP Asoka Priyantha, UNP Spokesman Harin Fernando said yesterday.
Mr. Fernando told Daily Mirror that crossing over of Asoka Priyantha was not significant as 118 MPs still oppose the appointment of Mr. Rajapaksa as the PM.
A majority of MPs may not support UNP Leader Ranil Wickremesinghe but they oppose the appointment of Mr. Rajapaksa, he said.
He said they are confident of getting the support of the SLMC led by MP Rauff Hakeem and the ACMC led by MP Rishad Bathiudeen as well.(Yohan Perera)

Rajitha conveys Presidents message to Ranil
	
UNP MP Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said today he met with President Maithripala Sirisena on Sunday on an invitation extended by him.
He told a media briefing that he carried a message from the President to UNP leader Ranil Wickremesinghe.
I met with President Sirisena on his invitation. Since I did not want to go alone, I invited MP John Amaratunga to accompany me. The President explained to me as to what made him appoint former President Mahinda Rajapaksa as Prime Minister. I then explained to him how his actions have affected the country. Later, I met Mr. Wickremesinghe and briefed him about the meeting. My meeting with the President has created a positive situation as far as the country is concerned, he said indicating that the country would come through the present crisis.
My meeting with the President was successful but one has to see how the outcome would be when it comes to implementing what we agreed upon. The meeting with the President is not associated with any crossover, he said. (Yohan Perera)

## Title: Sirisenas second turnaround
## Section: Opinion

Sirisenas second turnaround
	

triggered a new phase in Western meddling

Maithripala Sirisena is not exactly a type of politician described as charismatic or revolutionary. But in the space of three and a half years he has pulled off two dramatic political reversals in the countrys electoral history. The first was in 2014 when he broke ranks with the ruling UPFA coalition to be the UNP-led Oppositions common candidate in the 2015 election. Now hes unceremoniously dumped his UNP coalition partner, pulling the UPFA along with him to appoint his one-time bete noireMahinda Rajapaksa as his Prime Minister.
With the UPFA having to prove a majority in the House in the days ahead in order to crystallise the move, the situation has parallels with that which prevailed when the UNP-led coalition that failed to garner a clear majority in 2015, and multiple cross-overs helped to consolidate power.

"UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres in a phone call with President Sirisena on Nov.1 echoed the call of the western powers, urging the president to revert to Parliamentary procedures and allowthe Parliament to vote assoon as possible"
There has been furious debate on the legality/constitutionality or otherwise of the presidents actions, by loyalists on either side. This discussion related to the 19th Amendment that redefined the presidential powers. The main point of contention is that the Sinhala version of the Constitution is said to include removal by the president as one of the circumstances in which the prime minister ceases to hold office, whereas this condition is missing in the English version. It is the Sinhala version that prevails when there is a dispute, according to lawyers. A Supreme Court determination, if sought, would no doubt, help settle the legal question.
Meanwhile a closer look at the social context might help understand the forces at work in this drama. While constitutional experts split hairs over the interpretation of Article 48 subsection (1), or the meaning of Article 46 subsection (2), the reality is that these events come at a time of deep discontent among ordinary people across the country. The mood was best summed up by the chief prelate of a Colombo temple. In rough translation what he said was Voters, when these things happened, did not cry, lament, light lamps, or curse. There was not a sound. Ven. Galaboda Gnanissara Thera told reporters: The people were hard-pressed, trampled upon, saddened and living in fear. In any other country if a government elected by a majority was toppled, people would rise up. But here nobody lost any sleep. I too slept well.
As the monk suggested, it has been business as usual for the most part - in fact, stocks hit a six-week high. The mainstream media has not gone into overdrive, and service chiefs called on the new PM within days of his appointment.
Interestingly, those who rushed to Ranil Wickremesinghes side were western diplomats, who went into a huddle with him at Temple Trees and then came out with almost identical statements calling on the President to reconvene parliament immediately. This call reflected the demand of the UNP camp, for the government to prove its majority on the floor of the House immediately, without waiting for the assigned date; Nov.16. It is the Presidents prerogative to prorogue parliament, and the inordinate concern expressed by these ambassadors and high commissioners in what is essentially an internal problem, could be seen as unwarranted meddling. 
The meeting as well as subsequent declarations can be construed as a concerted and deliberate act against the Head of State, openly challenging the authority vested in the President by the people, interfering in internal political processes, and violating Sri Lankas sovereignty, said Tamara Kunanayakam, Sri Lankas former Ambassador to the UN, addressing an Eliya briefing.
She drew attention to the hypocrisy of these statements made by those who had nothing to say when Wickremesinghe was made prime minister in 2015 with the UNP in a minority while the UPFA held a two thirds majority in parliament, and when local and provincial council elections were endlessly postponed.
How do you explain that the same indignation was missing when Germany was unable to form a government for five months, when Belgium had no government for almost two years (541 days) and Northern Ireland was without government for even longer she asked.
In a more respectful response, the Chinese ambassador called on both MR and RW, while a spokesman in Beijing said What is going on in Sri Lanka is their domestic affairs. It should be mentioned that when Wickremesinghe was asked in an interview with NDTV if he saw a Chinese hand behind what was going on, his categorically reply was I dont see a Chinese hand.
In a development that could raise some eyebrows, UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres in a phone call with President Sirisena on Nov.1 echoed the call of the western powers, urging the president to revert to Parliamentary procedures and allow the Parliament to vote as soon as possible, according to a readout of the conversation on the UN website. He encouraged the Government to uphold its earlier commitments to human rights, justice and reconciliation, in line with UNHRC resolutions, the statement dated Nov.2, said. In a previous statement of Oct.28, however, the UNSG had only said he was following the latest developments with great concern and calling on the government to respect democratic values and constitutional process, uphold rule of law and ensure the safety of all Sri Lankans.
The reference to UNHRC resolutions raises the question as to whether the UNSGs second thoughts on the matter were influenced by those same western powers that led the 2015 GenevaResolution against Sri Lanka. The other question is whether the western powers concerns for Sri Lanka have more to do with their own vested interests, than peace and stability in the island nation.

"In a more respectful response, the Chinese ambassador called on both MR and RW, while a spokesman in Beijing said What is going onin Sri Lanka is theirdomestic affairs.
The UNSGs revised remarks come on the heels of a visit to the Speaker of Parliament on Oct. 30 by a delegation of Ambassadors and High Commissioners from the EU,Canada, UK and Germany along with the UN Resident Representative. At this meeting they reportedly warned of inimical consequences of the power transition. Its relevant to recall here how, during the 2014 CIA-backed coup in Ukraine, the US roped in a UN representative to help legitimize its actions. Or in other words glue the thing together as a US official famously said in a leaked phone call with the US ambassador in Ukraine at the time.
The sequence of events in Sri Lanka would suggest western powers have gone into high-gear over the current political impasse, presumably with a view to influencing the outcome. These developments serve as a pointer to intense underlying geopolitical tensions in the region. Western powers alarmed at a rising Chinas expanding footprint in this small but strategically located state, had counted on RW to bring the country within the western sphere of influence. The prospect of that project being undermined has rung alarm bells.
The new government will have more to deal with than revelations of an assassination plot targeting the President and former Defence Secretary. It will also have to navigate the threat of possible interventions by western powers alarmed by the prospect of further inroads by China. Such interventions will no doubt come packaged in the guise of a concern for democracy and human rights.

Teaching Kids STEM: A Sysco LABS, IgniterSpace collaboration
	
Sysco LABS, in collaboration with IgniterSpace and Sri Lanka Association of Software and Service Companies (SLASSCOM), held a workshop with children from the Maharagama Boys Home to introduce them to STEM education.
Sysco LABS sought to teach the fundamentals of engineering to the kids and help build a foundation from which they could explore their engineering creativity. For this project, Sysco LABS partnered with IgniterSpace, a leader in STEM education, and SLASSCOM, who provided the laptops for the session.
The untapped potential in kids is enormous. Depending on how they are guided during the early phases of their lives, they could become the innovators of the future, said Sysco LABS Vice President and General Manager, Rasika Karunatilake. These kids at the Maharagama Boys Home are no different. They just need to be given the right exposure to bring out their ingenuity.
The program was split into three main sections: building a glider, coding to create a small game and building a generator.
Building a glider
The first session, which involved building a glider, was conducted by two mentors from Sysco LABS, Harsha Wijendra and Isuru Samaranayake. First, the kids were taught about the basics of aerodynamics, center of gravity and how pressure works using everyday examples. Once the kids had a basic understanding of these concepts, they started to build a glider using materials such as cardboard, A4 sheets and medium-sized BBQ sticks. With minimal guidance, they were soon able to build near-perfect gliders.
Each of the kids were unique and they all showed talent, said Samaranayake, a software engineering intern. They were all keen to learn something they didnt know. I wish them all the very best for their future.
Coding
The coding session was conducted by mentors Udeni Jayawardhane, Vibodha Balalla, Rashali de Mel and Piyumi Sudusinghe. The kids had to learn the basics of coding and using that knowledge, they had to build a simple game. The kids learned programing concepts such as how to keep an object continuously moving, how to respond to keyboard events, how to detect the collision of two objects and how to use variables. The mentors each took charge of a group and coached the kids on the basics of programming.
Teaching someone to code for the first time is pretty difficult but the kids here made my task easy by grabbing the concepts of coding quickly, said Sudusinghe, a software engineering intern. They were quite inquisitive, asking plenty of questions and approached the task in front of them like playing a game. Watching their progress and seeing them completing their tasks made me happy.
Building a generator
The final session tackled how to build a small generator powered by a 1W LED using two CDs, three marmite bottles lids, a small popsicle stick, a round stick, a wooden board, a wooden cube, rubber bands, 12V motor, a female-female jumper cable, 1W LED and a straw.
Thiwanka Wimalasuriya and Dhananjaya Wimalasekera explained how the concept of a belt transmission works and how a dynamo works. Using this knowledge, the kids began their task of building a generator. After about 40 minutes of work, Wimalasuriya and Wimalasekera spotted the first flicker of light from a bulb. The kid that had built it was beaming with pride. Not long after, more and more lights began to flicker on.
The boys were curious to learn. Every child asked different kinds of questions, showing how differently each of them understood the concepts, said Sysco LABS Senior Quality Engineer Wimalasekera. Watching them tackle the task was a brand-new experience for me, one of my best days at work.

The countrys democracy in limbo: Where do  people stand today
	

ctober 26, 2018 is a date that will be marked in the notorious political history of Sri Lanka. A country that has once dealt with insurrections, civil wars and minority clashes has now ended up in a confusing political crisis once again. The onset of events which followed since this date has been rather obnoxious. Obnoxious because people had no say in any of the events that transpired. Democracy was at a standstill. While the President himself claimed he had powers to sack a Prime Minister and appoint a purported one it could have been better if he went in for a vote. Or so claims several pro and anti-factions observing the existing crisis. Justifying the turn of events as another coup dtat the President doesnt seem to be re-convening the Parliament till November 16. Whether the proroguing took place to gain more majority votes for the MR clan or whether it is actually to table the On Account of budget isnt quite clear at this point. Quite interestingly, several UNP stalwarts were also offered inducements to join the newly formed purported government and one or two of them were brave enough to expose the staggering offers. 
While all this is going on, where do the people stand Those who believe that democracy shouldnt be at a standstill are continuing to protest to restore it. Hence the Daily Mirror spoke to several factions including the public to find out what they felt about the existing political crisis. 
We shouldnt forget that when half of the country voted for Maithripala back in 2015, half of those votes were also against MR. It was a move to bring back good governance and to end abuse of power. He also had an election promise that he would abolish the executive presidency and few years later he does a 180 U-turn. If people dont stand up for democracy it will die. Its important for people to understand that when people come into power they try to abuse it. Even if the President feels that MR would now command the Parliament, theres a way in which things could have been done. In fact in a more civilized manner. You dont have a leader who would suddenly wake up to change the countrys Prime Minister. He should have thought of the repercussions and its trickle-down effect on the masses.
Dilumi further said that the President should have acted more responsibly. People should continuously cry out for democracy. When looking at social media we see that people have started to voice out their opinions. People need to move on and put pressure so that the Parliament would be convened so that they could take a vote.
The Presidents decision to appoint MR as PM in this manner is a violation of our constitution and democratic processes. It is a violation of our democratic rights. People need to stand up and resist this violation. A key principle of democracy is that the people have a say in who our leaders are; we get to play a major part in that process. This is in complete violation of that. 
In fact, the President has betrayed all those who voted for him in a grave manner, she continued. It is unacceptable and unforgivable. But this is not the moment to feel defeated or hopeless either, for us - in a sense this violation of our trust should give us all the more reason to be active, vocal and stand up. The civil society stands by democratic process. We are not interested in protecting any one party or any one person. This appointment of MR was unconstitutional and undemocratic and we need it to be resolved immediately. Parliament needs to be reconvened so our elected leaders can decide. Furthermore, we maintain our critique of all political actors and parties; we remember that this government did not deliver on many of its promises to the people. Many people feel let down by this government too and this is very legitimate. But that does not mean illegal appointments can be made in violation of democratic process.
She further said that everyone should use whatever platform available to them to resist this. This is a major crisis for us politically and socially. If we allow this to happen without resistance, we will go down in history for that -- for letting down a country. Use social media. Join with other groups to get involved. Read and inform yourself of what is going on and help inform others, to battle misinformation. Clergy should use their powers of influence to talk to people about the erosion of democracy and human rights and how very dangerous that is. Everyone needs to get involved. 
Airing his views regarding the prevailing political crisis said that even the Soulbury Constitution was manipulated to overthrow hill country Tamils. Hence there was no attempt to include all segments of people. The latter Constitution also mainly protects Sinhalese-nationalist orientations of the State. But we only have the present Constitution to move on. The manner in which the President manipulated the present Constitution is unhealthy and he was crude about it as well. The only way to restore some sanity is to speak on the spirit of the 19A where the President cannot dismiss the PM.
He further said that the TNAs stance is correct and that being neutral in this situation is once again unhealthy. Speaking on how various groups could add pressure to move in the right direction, Dr. Hoole suggested that trade unions could be actively involved in bringing some pressure on the government. Even civil society groups can be involved. I wont approve of riotous mobs taking to the streets but everybody should do what they can do within peaceful and legal constraints.
We live in a democratic country with democratic principles. But the process that has taken place is undemocratic. It wouldnt have been so if it was done in Parliament. There have been several crossovers starting from the time of C.P. de Silva. Any other method would be described as coup. Hence, this is an equivalent of a coup. Attacks on minority groups are one of the fears that we have and we saw how the culprits involved in the Digana, Teldeniya incidents were also released. Therefore it is not a good sign for Sri Lanka.
Leave aside this constitutional issue and ask the most important question: who commands the majority support among the MPs in the current Parliament This cannot be a matter of opinion as it can be easily tested. Simply convene the Parliament and take a vote. The present political developments are not just what happened over the last week or so, but in fact, what happened last week was the culmination of developments since 2015.
The government that came to power in 2015 was not exactly what people voted for. Instead of a government committed to the key elements of the mandate given to the newly elected leaders, namely, to pursue a programme of work covering good governance, national reconciliation, strengthening of rule of law, lean government, adoption of evidence based development and other policies, stamping out corruption, de-politicisation of state machinery, professionalisation of foreign service, criminal justice, etc, the newly elected leaders by and large continued to rule the country in the usual manner. The appointment of a large cabinet and giving all kinds of privileges to them at public expense, increasing evidence of corrupt practices, refusal to adopt sound public policies and strengthen state institutions.
It is these developments that led to the poor showing of the government at the local government elections. The bond scam was a major factor that contributed to the electoral debacle of the government at the LG elections. Yet, the leaders did not respond to the growing public disenchantment in a decisive and constructive manner. 

President has appointed the former President, Mahinda Rajapaksa as the PM, without giving the MPs the opportunity to cast their vote for him or any other contender including the incumbent PM. This has led to the present crisis and even anger and frustration among many people in the country. It is true that the party under his de facto leadership of MR did well at the last LG elections but people there did not vote to elect a national leader. The change of the PM, if we do now, should be the responsibility of the present parliament.
Most importantly, the last regime was defeated in 2015 due to its serious weaknesses and diverse allegations against it ranging from abuse of power, corruption, nepotism, politicisation of state institutions , etc. People have not seen any effort on the part of the leaders and other activists connected with the last regime to say that such misdeeds will not be repeated if and when they come to power again. This is a serious matter for people who voted in 2015 for a cleaner and leaner government and do not want a government that would continue with poor governance practices, corruption and abuse of power.
It is against this background that the right thinking people in this country worry about change of regime without any assurance that the change is going to make the situation in the country better in terms of governance practices and improved public welfare. Many people in this country have been disenchanted with the past leaders as well as the present ones. They naturally want a change for the better, certainly not want to bring back poor governance practices that they witnessed in the country in the recent past. What they very much hope for is a better situation for themselves and their children, not a much worse situation in the years to come.
The political leaders need to reassure people that the governance situation in the country is going to be better than what it has been in the recent past and over the last few years. They have to show how they are going to bring about that kind of positive change in the country, to make the life chances better for the wider public, not just to those who are in power and their retinue.
As is well known, it is politicians, their families and supporters who did well in recent times, often at the expense of the hapless masses. To improve the economic and social conditions in the country, it is necessary to rationalise the government machinery, get the most competent and qualified people to take policy decisions, and adopt evidence based policies, rather than to rule the country with a group of self-seeking friends, acquaintances and political loyalists as many leaders have done over the years, making the economic and social conditions intolerable for the vast majority of people.
"Its not a matter of being constitutionally right or wrong its a matter of basic human values, basic political ethics and morals that many people have lost. Looking at the political drama that reached a climax on October 26, one can only wonder what happened to our social value system, he said.
The President has let down the whole nation by this most unethical and immoral act. And who would bear the cost other than the ordinary masses of this Country and speaking on the probable economic losses that the country had to endure, he said if one could calculate the cumulative foreign exchange loss for the nation just from the cancellations of hotel rooms during the past few days that will give us a glimpse of the economic catastrophe of this political drama.
Adding to that, he asked when the nation was bleeding already especially having an external debt repayment commitment of over US$ 15 billion in 2019 how can the politicians behave so irresponsibly very well knowing the economic cost of their action.
The king coconut suppliers, poultry suppliers to hotels; people at the bottom of the pyramid suffer the most the consequences of this political drama. Arent our leaders at least compassionate towards the common man of this country Do they have a moral right to come before the public to seek a mandate
The authorities should investigate into the sources of the colossal amounts of money which are being used to do Horse trading. The politicians are gradually conditioning the minds of the people to accept and live with corruption and its the time we should rethink and liberate ourselves from the vicious clutches of these political ruffians.

The Daily Mirror also spoke to the public and this is what they had to say:
Every regime is the same
- Sanath, a privatecompany employee
Every regime is the same. The cost of living is eternally high. They have reduced the prices of essential items but they would continue to fill their pockets. We have to earn to live and they are not going to look after us although they make big promises. 

Price reduction is an eyewash
- Shashika, student
Whoever are in power ultimately considers their personal benefit above any other concern. They will reduce prices for now and as they continue, they will increase these prices again. 
Changes should happen constitutionally
- Rasangi, student
As a country that works according to a Constitutional process, these things shouldnt happen. We dont care about whos in power but it should happen according to the Constitution and public opinion. In the case of electing the PM it would have been better if they went in for a vote rather than acting according to their own will. 
We hope democracy would prevail
- Stefan, Law student
We cant say whether the existing situation is fair or unfair. But we hope that democracy will prevail. 

RW should be sent into exile
- Vihanga, Law student
It was only at this point that RW thought its unfair to overthrow a PM in this manner. What was he thinking all this time But the President was finally able to reveal who was involved in the bond scam. So I believe that RW should be sent into exile. 

They should have acted in a democratic manner
- Nihal, three - wheeler owner
Reducing three wheel fares is alright but if they did this aiming at an election then its unfair. There seems to be instability in the government and its better if they could summon Parliament and go for a vote instead. People are also stranded because of this crisis, and if they really think about the people they should act in a democratic manner.

Time running out to avert 'bloodbath: RW
	
UNP LeaderRanil Wickremesinghe has warned that the time is running out to avert a "bloodbath" while voicing hope that Parliament will resolve a damaging constitutional crisis in the coming days.
In an interview with the AFP, Mr.Wickremesinghe has said that "desperate people" could cause chaos.
"We will be calling on our people not to resort to violencebut you don't know what arises in a situation like this.A few desperate people can start off a bloodbath, hesaid on Friday.
Mr.Wickremesinghe said he hoped the showdown could be ended peacefully and expressed optimism that a solution to the crisis would soon be found.
"I feel Parliament is going to prevail finally. This can't take too long. I would say in a week to 10 days at the most," he said, adding the priority was to establish Parliament's "supremacy".
Mr.Wickremesinghe said two smaller parties - the Marxist Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna and the Tamil National Alliance - were backing his call for the legislature to meet despite obstacles placed by Sirisena.
"A majority of Parliament has said all these actions (of the president) are not legitimate and not in accordance with the Constitution," he said.
