Being independent in Parliament: JO appoints committee
	
The party leaders of the Joint Opposition (JO) today appointed a committee of experts led by Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) Chairman Professor G.L.Peiris to study the matter of becoming independent in Parliament.
Some of the MPs of the JO were considering the notion of becoming independent in Parliament, after leaving the United Peoples Freedom Alliance (UPFA) in their crusade to obtain the Opposition Leaders post.
Speaking to Daily Mirror, Prof. Peiris said the matter of becoming independent was discussed at great length at the party leaders meeting which was held under the leadership of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa.
There appears to be various aspects of this issue and it was decided that all these different aspects needs to be considered in depth and in great details before a final decision is made. Therefore, it was decided to appoint a committee of experts under my chairmanship and consisting of party leaders and others, to look at all the issues and to make a report, he said.
He said the committee would look at the matter carefully and would present a report to the party leaders. The final decision will be made only after considering the report of this committee of expert, he said.
Opposition Leader nominee of the JO, MP Dinesh Gunawardane and MP Dullas Alahapperuma have also been appointed as members of the committee. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

## Title: Being socially conscious: The theatre of tomorrow

Being socially conscious: The theatre of tomorrow
	
A prelude to AnandaDramas Grease Yaka Returns, to be staged from the 17th to the 19th of August at 7.30 p.m. at the Lionel Wendt Theatre.


My friend Kris, with whom Ive agreed to disagree, argues against the notion of culture. His reasoning is simple. What we understand as culture (and art) today is (according to him) a field cut off from actual experience. Call it aestheticism if you will, but his point is that as long as the artiste is cut off from the reality around him (or her), no theatre, no cinema, and no literature can thrive for long. Art that subsists on artifice only, which does not relate to the wider society of the author and his audience, is more or less devoted to its own workings. And in being devoted to its own workings like this, it fails to transcend the limitations of its medium and bring out something, anything, be it in the form of a message or a parable, which can help us understand who we are, what we are doing, and we can do to improve our condition. There are very few things about which I can agree with Kris. This issue, I feel, is one of them. 
Take theatre, for instance. University dons and intellectuals have valiantly tried to turn it into an esoteric activity which is supposed to subsist on the artists individuality, but then isnt it futile if we continue to define the medium on the basis of how it alienates popular audiences Shakespeare, lets not forget, did not write his plays intending them to be studied. He wrote them to entertain, and to relate them to the concerns and issues which ailed the society in which he lived. The same can be said of all those other playwrights and writers who tried to bridge the gap between individual genius and popular success in their work, right down to the 20th and the 21st centuries. One aspect of this revolution in theatre, if you can call it that, is socially conscious drama. No, it is not a new phenomenon by any stretch of the imagination. Im thinking here of Sri Lankan theatre, in particular Sri Lankan ENGLISH theatre. In that regard, this is not a review of a play, but an attempt at a sketch of that particular kind of drama. 

University dons and intellectuals have valiantly tried to turn it into an esoteric activity which is supposed to subsist on the artists individuality, but then isnt it futile if we continue to define the medium on the basis of how it alienates popular audiences

I am sorry to say that I forgot to review one of the best satires to come out of the Lionel Wendt in recent years, Picket Republic, staged last December. Written and directed by Nishantha de Silva, Rajitha Hettiarachchi, and Isthartha Wellaboda, through AnandaDrama, in which they are leading members, the play tried, via a collaborative process, to offer some thoughts on the society and culture of protests and demonstrations which were rampant at the time. (Just days before it was staged, for instance, the Ceylon Electricity Board union threatened another uninterrupted strike.) 2017 can indeed be called the year of trade union agitation, but those behind Picket Republic did not, thankfully, turn its satirical overtones into an excuse to lampoon the trade unionists only. On the contrary, from the first Act and scene, it maintained a balance between fantasy and reality, puncturing the narrative with several vantage points from which we could assess the political and the social unfolding in the country. Protests and demonstrations were an integral element of all that, but there was more, much more (to give just one example, the tropical storm in the first Act which the Met Department did not forecast was, yes, that storm which swept through the country last November and was not tracked down by that very same Department). 


And yet, Picket Republic was not an isolated phenomenon. Since of late, there has been a rise in the type of satirical theatre it projected that December night. You can call it socially conscious if you want to, refracted through humour and barely concealed contempt, but whatever you call it, you cannot ignore its relevance to a medium once associated with esoteric indifference. And not for no reason. As Gehan Gunatilleke wrote years ago, satire as is understood in the Wendt-ian sense was in danger of becoming a mere antidote and morphine, legitimising social hierarchies and hegemonies in the guise of making fun of them. These slick attempts at satire, in other words, did not gravitate towards political commentary, but rather, by overtly identifying particular characters with specific ideologies and personalities, encouraged a culture of indifference whereby even the politicians lampooned by them begin to see in them an alternative to resistance. They thus encourage these satires, because they dont make us want to question reality, they want to make us make fun of it; so much so that through ceaseless repetition, satire becomes cleverly packaged propaganda. 
I am not a student of theatre by any stretch of the imagination, and not being one, I cannot explore this anomaly - between the imperatives of satire and the absence of social consciousness in the satires we have seen - properly. I can, however, vouch for the veracity, and the genuineness, of the satires which have sought to transcend this anomaly and project themselves on audiences through a mixture of relevance and irreverence. This is the kind of satire which came to us through Picket Republic, the kind that roots itself in the socially conscious theatre promoted by the group behind that play, AnandaDrama. Before I go any further, however, a brief outline of the history of that group, and their valiant forays into this kind oftheatre, is called for. 
That history as such begins in 2006, when Nishantha, with a bunch of students, formed a Drama Society at their school, Ananda College. Their baptism of fire had been an extract from Timon of Athens, followed by skit performances of Macbeth, Coriolanus, Hamlet, The Tempest, The Taming of the Shrew, and Romeo and Juliet. Shakespeare had subsequently given way to more contemporary texts, when in 2013, having transformed themselves into AnandaDrama (a Non-Profit Company Limited by Guarantee), they forayed into satire with an original work, Alles in Wonderland (the title and allusion make it clear what they were aiming at), followed just a few months later by an adaptation of Michael Morpurgos Kensukes Kingdom. 2015 saw Dracula, staged sadly to an indifferent audience. More relevantly though, among these three productions, there was one which stood out on account of the themes it tackled and the form it made use of. This was Grease Yaka, which was devised, brought together players from various backgrounds, and saw the group collaborate with Ruwanthi de Chickera. As with Alles and Kensuke, however, I sadly missed it. 


The awards and victories that AnandaDrama has clinched over the years, Ive listed out elsewhere. For the purposes of this piece, it is enough for us to know that while they were not pioneers in socially conscious theatre (satirical or otherwise), they have, the way I see it, charted a fresh path for that genre. To be sure, before AnandaDrama became AnandaDrama in 2013, efforts had been made to bring out the socially relevant overtones of the medium. (To mention just two of them, Tracy Holsingers Travelling Circus in 2009 and Ruwanthis Checkpoint in 2001.) But at the time of Alles in Wonderland, Grease Yaka, and Picket Republic, there was a lull in the genre. Satire had deteriorated to self-congratulatory parody (as Ive pointed out before) and the English theatre in general had become associated with esotericism, the sort that the representatives of polite society just had to go to as a matter of etiquette. With AnandaDrama, and more importantly the spate of plays they have staged from their inception, I see the emergence of a new kind of theatre, probably the most important weve seen in the medium for years. And as with all such new kinds of theatre, the one they have seemingly brought about has encouraged others to experiment in the genre. 
What distinguishes the socially conscious thrust of AnandaDrama from other outfits and individuals that tout that label and have valorised it in the name of satire, I think, is the willingness on the part of that group to eschew the easy way out in any drama involving social and political undertones, i.e. the identification of one character with one ideology. It would be futile, in this sense, to attribute a set ideology to the players in a work like Picket Republic, not just because it is unproductive, but also because it was never the intention of the cast and crew behind it to make us interpret the political setting of the narrative in terms of real-life politicians. For instance, which political heavyweight would you associate with Her Pride (Prauda Rajani), the cast aside leader from the Picket Republic Which astrologer would you associate with Chandragomara Kiruldeniya, an indispensible part of Her Proudness retinue 
In other words, by fleshing out the narrative and the characters, by attributing to them not just one but many ideologies, the team behind these productions are making us aware that society is not composed of set pieces, that politicians and administrators are not the unyielding types we think they are. Yes, being a satire, it is impossible to resist the urge to associate characters with their real life equivalents, and I will not say that AnandaDrama has completely turned away from it, but where it has resorted to it, it has ensured that the resultant simplifications do not offer a reductive interpretation of the society it claims to (re)present. Holding a mirror image to that society is not the objective of AnandaDrama (and it shouldnt be, anyway); offering us a more nuanced, multifaceted reading of it is. In the end, both the cast and crew on the one hand and the audience on the other profit, because we, particularly the young, are tired of what has been advertised as socially conscious, and satire, throughout these past few years.

Clinical waste: MEPA to request Ministry to take up issue with India
	
The Maritime Environment Protection Authority (MEPA) today said that it would request the Ministry of Environment to discuss with the Indian High Commission at a diplomatic level urging India to prevent clinical waste from being released towards Sri Lanka.
MEPA CEO Dr Terney Pradeep Kumara said that they had started collecting and sorting the waste that had been washed ashore on the coastal areas off Puttalam.
He said the clinical waste would incinerate them in chemical waste incinerators.
We are going request the Indian High Commission through the Ministry of Mahaweli Development and Environment to take action to prevent clinical waste of India washing ashore on Sri Lankan beaches, he said.
On Tuesday the MEPA confirmed the clinical waste which had washed ashore was from India.
The India Today News website earlier reported the waste included a large stock of expired drugs, manufactured in India.
Similar clinical waste had previously washed ashore in this manner in Vadamarachchi, Thondaimanaru and other parts of the Jaffna District on November 17, 2017.
Speaking to the Daily Mirror MEPA Puttalam District officer Ms Priyanga Samarasekera said they had started cleaning the beach in Udappuwa in the North Western coastal belt to Cinna Padu in Puttalam with the support of the team of eight personnel.
We are going to conduct a examine after collecting the clinical waste, she said
But from the collected clinical waste so far, ninety per cent of them are from Sri Lanka. We could not collect at least five kilograms of Indian chemical waste from the beach.
We did not found any syringes, needles or anything related to India, she said.
Most of the waste was found was cosmetic bottles, food wrappers, multivitamin bottles and plastic bottles manufactured in Sri Lanka. The bottles that are suspected to be from India were found without labels, she said.
The hazardous waste would be sent to the Holcim Cement for incineration. (Chaturanga Samarawickrama)

Disabled youth who authored several books using only his index finger
	

When Irfan was born as the third member of a family of eight, his parents never expected him to fall a victim of Duchene Muscular Dystrophy or the crippling of the muscular system when he completed 04 years of age. 
At the age of eighteen his entire body lost mobility and was confined to bed and on a life supporter. He could move only his index finger, but his spirit was unfailing. His determination to live saved him from despair and any mental frustration. 
Irfan Hafeez of Beruwala, at the beginning studied at Zahira College in Dharga Town. His father had been the Principal of a school. Irfan could only complete his education up to grade five, when early signs of his rare sickness was witnessed by his parents. The doctors who were consulted by the family revealed to them that the child was suffering from this rare disease and his muscular system is crippling daily. His father who made inquiries about this sickness through medical bulletins and research articles had realized that this was an incurable disease and the complete life span of a patient suffering from it is limited to eighteen years. 
Having witnessed his disabled son fallen from the bed while his mother had attempted to put him on it, and she lying with him on the floor being unable to lift him back, Irfans father took a bold step to prematurely retire from service in order to care for his son. 
Irfan though weak with all his limbs being non functional did not lose his inborn skills in penmanship. He did not want to idle like many disabled individuals. Time was precious, at a time when many were using social media through Face Book etc and polluting the society, young Irfan had a different idea. He started using a laptop and in the year 2011 he joined the Face Book not with the idea of engaging in anti social activities like most followers of Face Book presently. His talents and skills were not to be used in that manner but in the composition of simple poems and verses, which had a very favourable response and the comments made by a large number of followers encouraged him and brought new life to him. With the number of followers increasing daily, the very appreciative comments infused more life within Irfan. Though frail in health he became strong in his mental alertness which led to the launch of a compilation of verses by him titled Silent Struggle in 2012. Not stopping at that he ventured into writing short stories. His Moments of Merriment which was a collection of short stories with a word count of 40,000 took nearly a year for him to complete. 
In 2016 he completed his Silent Thoughts. All his creative works earned international fame with repeated publications. 
Knowing very well that his life span is short lived, he never lost a moment to share his writing skills among a major section of the society. He earned the name of Silent Fighter. His life was well spent in giving to the world in verse form the adversity faced by him and the continued perseverance to portray that he had nothing to lose but much to gain and be an example to those who lose hope in situations like the ones faced by him.

Get us away from this predicament  Ayagama landslide victims
	
The wattle and daub shelter Nimalsiri lived in before the floods
Ariyarathna and his family, still live in a building of the village school


A family of eight children, displaced during the landslide in Muniheenkanda hill that caused much havoc in Kolambewa village in the Ayagama Division in the Ratnapura district on May 26, 2017, has been living in a part of the Kolambewa school building without any attention of the authorities. 
The breadwinner of the family, Mawarakanda Watukarage Ariyarane (50) said his family comprises of his elderly mother, wife and eight children was provided temporary shelter in the school building when their house with all household effects were razed to the ground during the disaster. 
A vast area of about l0 acres forestation project in the hill had eroded with trees and boulders crashing down to the ground on the three houses at the foot of the hill. Eight people, including seven members of one family were buried alive. The Army and the police searched for the disappeared and found only five bodies.
Ariyaratnes house was destroyed in the disaster, but the occupants had miraculously escaped death. 


We were desperate to find a sustenance to keep at least our noses above the water. Often boiled leaves plucked from the jungle constitute our meal. We received dry ration only for two months
Ariyarathna


Our village is in the Ayagama division in the Kalawana electorate in the Ratnapura district. We experienced torrential rain from early hours of May 25 last year and at around 8.00 pm, it resulted in a flood threat. Towards midnight, my house was about three feet under water. We left for a neighbours house. A little while later a vast area of the hill came crashing down with a deafening noise. Our house with all other belongings, and even school books of my children were buried under mounds of earth. We made a long trek through hard terrain to the house of a known person.
When we heard his house too was endangered with landslide, we went to another house a little distance from the landslide prone area. There were several other displaced families seeking shelter in that house. We spend about a week there until we were given temporary shelter in Kolambewa School which was in abandoned state. We cleared the shrub jungle that had grown up to the roof of the building and occupied the teachers quarters. My daughter attained age after four months since we moved in and we celebrated the occasion with traditional custom.

Aftermath of the torrential rain last year

My eldest son had got through his A/Levels with two As and a B, but he was unemployed. We were desperate to find a sustenance to keep at least our noses above the water. Often boiled leaves plucked from the jungle constitute our meal. We received dry ration only for two months, he said. 

The two families appealed to the relevant authorities not to ignore them any more without a fixed abode and said they were prepared to make a livelihood, even as casual workers if they had a permanent house to live in
He requested the authorities to provide them with a plot of land from the state Paragahahena Mukalana and means to build a house without offering excuses attributing to the delay in Geological Survey and Mines Bureau report.
Weragala Hewage Nimalsiris family is another displaced family living in the school building. He said his house with all household effects was buried under the huge mound of earth and boulders that came down. 
When our house went under water, we left for a safer location and in the morning we found our house was no more. We lived at a neighbours house for a couple of days and shifted to the Kolambewa school building. Ayagama Divisional Secretarys office provided us with dry rations for about two months. We had depended on the meagre income from a tea small holding, but that too was destroyed by the landslide. Now we are left without any income to run the family.

A family forced to live in a temporary tent

The authorities are not concerned about our predicament. Our request for a plot of land and funds to build a house have fallen on deaf ear. Nimalsiri lamented. 
The two families appealed the relevant authorities not to ignore them any more without a fixed abode. They said they were prepared to make a livelihood, even as casual workers or being self-employed, if they had a permanent house to live in. 
We will have nowhere to turn if the authorities decided to eject us from the school building and to use it for any other purpose they said. 

Nimalsiri and his wife are also living in the village school

The Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) yesterday urged that Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne should reveal who permitted the lifting of the ban on the controversial weedicide Glyphosate.
Addressing a press briefing GMOA Assistant Secretary Dr Nalinda Herath said the Agriculture Registrar could not permit lifting of the ban arbitrarily.
The Agriculture Registrar should seek Health Ministry Secretarys consent before lifting the ban. No one knows whether the Health Ministry Secretary approved this. We expect an explanation from Minister Senaratne if the Secretary had approved this as the Minister too, is against herbicides, he said.
Further, the GMOA conveyed its gratitude to the Bar Association of Sri Lanka (BASL) for its interest and stance on the matter.
The GMOA also said that the lifting of the ban on Glyphosate was against the sustainable development programme launched under the theme of Wasavisa Nathi Ratak (Poison-free country) by President Maithripala Sirisena, due to its harmful effects.
The GMOA urged the Minister to reveal the officials who were behind the lifting of the ban on Glyphosate. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

The Ihala Kotmale Reservoir and Wimalasurendra Reservoir had reached spill level because of the heavy rains in the catchment areas, the engineers in charge of the reservoirs said.
The water level of the Kotmale Oya had risen after one of the spill gates of the Ihala Kotmale reservoir was opened today.
The heavy rains had also resulted in the water levels of the Castlereagh and Mausakelle reservoirs to reach spill.
The Ceylon electricity Board (CEB) said hydro-power generation at the Canyon, Laxapana, New Laxapana, Polpitiya and Wimalasurendra reservoirs is continuing at maximum capacity.(Shantha Chandrasiri and Ranjith Rajapakse)

Indian clinical waste reaches Puttalam
	
The mounting clinical waste in coastal areas off Puttalam has washed ashore from India, the Maritime Environment Protection Authority (MEPA) confirmed yesterday.
Speaking to Daily Mirror, MEPA CEO Dr. Terney Pradeep Kumara said clinical waste could be found in Kanda Duwa, Cinna Padu, Periya Padu and Palliwatta Padu in Puttalam.
Residents in these areas complained to the MEPA that 50 to 60 kilograms of clinical waste were found washed ashore. Expired medicines, bottles, polythene packages, syringes and surgical hand gloves were among them, he said.
Mr. Kumara alleged that expired clinical waste would have been released to the rivers and streams in Tamil Nadu and that it would have reached Sri Lankan soil due to sea currents.
We cannot prevent clinical waste from coming to local beaches because it is a natural process, he said.
However, the MEPA warned the public not to collect clinical waste without any safety precaution, and not to swim in the seas off the coast where clinical waste gathered.
Just like clinical waste released by India arrived in Sri Lanka, effluents released by us may reach the Maldives. Clinical waste is often identified by labels, he said. (Chaturanga Samarawickrama)

## Title: Learning Process and Western Science

Learning Process and Western Science
	
Abduction is guessing of an explanation (reason) of an observed property of the members of a population
	Western Science scientists who want to explain nature adopt the trial and error method in arriving at axioms

People and animals learn by trial and error if left to themselves. It is revealed by experiments done with mice when they are left to find their way through a mesh with blocks and openings. They try one path; if they do not succeed they try another path and so on until they find their way out. Children left on their own follow the same method of trial and error.
In Western Science scientists who want to explain nature adopt the same method in arriving at axioms that explain observations with respect to a property of the members of the population.
This method is known as abduction after the American Philosopher and Logician Charles Sanders Peirce (1839 -1914). Abduction, though in the earlier formulations of Peirce had similarities with induction, is entirely different from induction.
In abduction, in order to explain a set of observations a hypothesis, an axiom is guessed.
If the axiom does not lead up to the set of observations, then the particular axiom is dropped and a different axiom is introduced.
The process is repeated until a satisfactory axiom is obtained. The axiom if satisfactory, is sometimes called a theory. This is what happens in abduction but it has to be elaborated in comparison with induction and deduction. It has to be emphasized that satisfactory does not mean true or correct.
We shall first discuss briefly deduction, induction and abduction.
Deduction
In deduction, there are definitions, axioms and rules of inference in a given population. We restrict ourselves to the use of the word inference only with respect to deduction.
Depending on the population, we identify either concrete deductions or abstract deductions. The population has to be identified first, followed with definitions and axioms.
Consider first, a concrete example. Let the population be a box of toys. It has to be understood that box, colour, white and toy have been defined in a larger context, in a larger population. Consider the property of colour of the toys. Let us begin with the axiom All toys are white.
Deductions are made using rules of inference. The rules of inference, as shown above, are arrived at by induction. It has to be emphasized that the axioms are mere statements unless they had been deduced in a different context.
In any event, the very first axioms are not deduced, and are mere statements. Thus, reasoning alone leads us nowhere, though many people have a kind of faith in the process. These people do not believe in God, afterlife, but believe in reason. Can they show that reason is not a belief
We shall consider two deductions one in a finite population and the other in an infinite population.
The syllogism is a rule of inference obtained by induction. If the objects in a population have the same property, then we know that any object of the population must have that property.
It can be generalized as, if all M is P, all S is M, then all S are P. Applying this syllogism to the toys in the box we deduce that since all toys are white, and if some toys are selected from the bag, then the selected toys are white.

Deductions are made using rules of inference. The rules of inference, as shown above, are arrived at by induction. It has to be emphasized that the axioms are mere statements unless they had been deduced in a different context
Let us now consider the case of the population of straight lines. This is a population of the infinite number of members. Then starting with some of the definitions and axioms and theorems in Euclidean Geometry, and the rule of inference if a+b=a+c, then b=c, it can be shown that when any two straight lines intersect each other the alternate angles are equal. (It is easy to see that the rule of inference if a+b=a+c, then b=c, is also obtained by induction).
In deduction whether in a population of a finite number of members or of infinite members one starts with definitions and axioms and conclusions are arrived at using rules of inference.
Induction
Induction, as mentioned before, is a generalization of a property of a sample(s) of members of the population to the entire population.
When the population is finite it is called concrete induction, whereas, when the population is infinite it is called abstract induction. The result of induction could be tested by considering members of the population, other than in the sample(s).
Suppose we take a box of toys and select a few members and find them to be white. Then by induction, we may say that all the toys in the box are white. If we come across even one toy in the box, which is not white, then our statement obtained from induction becomes invalid.
Thus, induction can also be taken as a test for the statement arrived at. Though this is a population of finite members by considering the more famous examples such as all swans are white or all crows are black, we can say abstract induction can be considered as a test as well.
Abduction
The abduction was introduced by American philosopher and mathematician Charles Sanders Pierce, though at first, he himself could not see the difference between abduction and induction. Abduction is guessing of an explanation (reason) of an observed property of the members of a population.
Let us consider the case of falling apples. One has to give a reason for the falling of the apples. One could say that there is an affinity for the apples to fall to the earth, with heavy apples having a strong affinity. However, apples come down with the same acceleration, and one gives up ones guess. Newton comes and guesses something else, which happens to work, maybe under certain conditions. Newtons guess is taken as the reason for the falling of the apples.


Western Science very much concerned with observations
	But observations of the multiverse are beyond the capacity of scientists


Induction and Abduction in Western Science
Abduction is relevant to Western science as it is the method that is used in arriving at axioms that explain generalized observations through induction.
We may call it the scientific method if such a descriptionis needed.
However, in Western science, there are two stages. In the first stage observations and induction take place in that order, and in the second stage abduction and observations take place in that order. Having said that it has to be emphasized that in the first stage the observations are dependent on theory or ones beliefs and that the observations could have been proceeded by thoughts.
There are neither observations independent of conceptions, nor perceptions without conceptions and the idea of perceptions without conceptions stem again from the dualities in Western Chinthanaya.
In Western science, it is said that the observations are important, but in Cosmology and modern Theoretical Physics the ideas are considered to be supreme.
The symmetry of theories, Mathematical consistency and beauty whatever they mean, have become very important.
It is as if the Universes or Multiverses have been created Mathematically, and one may be inclined to think that God is a Mathematician, assuming that God exists.
Western science is very much concerned with observations but observations of the multiverse are beyond the capacity of the scientists.
It is only an idea, and Mathematics is all about ideas arrived at by induction or by construction. Axioms in Euclidean Geometry have been arrived at by induction, while those of Non- Euclidean Geometry are constructions.
What I mean by Mathematics, is what is sometimes known as Pure Mathematics, excluding anything that goes as Applied Mathematics.
However, this does not mean that ideas exist independent of observations when sensory perceptible conceptions are considered.
In the second stage, we said that abductions and observations took place in that order. The guesses are made to explain the generalized observations from the first stage, and having made guesses or axioms observations are usually carried out in order to arrive at an axiom that works.
The word usually has been used as it is not the case with multiverses and string theory.

Lessons to learn from Bdesh turmoil  Roots of Bangladesh turmoil lie in economic issues
	

Peace has returned to Bangladesh after ten days of a student agitation, which was brutally quelled by the police and club-wielding thugs of the ruling Awami League.
But the issues underlying the stir remain and might re-surface in other forms as the country heads towards parliamentary elections likely to be held between October 31 and December 31, this year. And the roots of the trouble could be traced to economic issues.
Bangladesh has been experiencing an impressive 7.5 % GDP growth, but the growth has benefited only the rich. It has not given the expected returns to the upwardly-mobile middle classes in the urban and rural areas.
The recent agitation was but a manifestation of a deeper malaise, namely, growing frustration among the middle classes, which are facing economic difficulties. Poor investment in the public services, income less or jobless economic growth and widening disparities between the rich and the middle classes are worrying the urban middle class and the upwardly mobile rural middle class, says political commentator Afsan Chowdhury.
Remittances from abroad, coupled with expanding educational facilities and growth in agricultural production, have stirred ambitions among rural youth which are crying for attention, Chowdhury adds.

There were allegations of foreign and foreign-funded NGOs backing the agitation to destabilize the country and bring about regime change
The deaths of students Dia and Rajib could not be described merely as a Road Accident.
It was the result of the unbridled and unplanned growth of the transport sector and the neglect of the countrys roads, both reflecting unconcern for the welfare of the common man, opines economist Hossain Zillur Rahman in an article in The Daily Star.
We have endured the road anarchy, sometimes in anger, but mostly in silence. Our concerns and agonies have mattered little to those who matter, Rahman says.
Politicization of Every Issue
The other issue is the instant politicization of the agitation. While taking stringent measures to curb reckless driving, the Sheikh Hasina government accused the opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) of fuelling the riots by sending in young men with bags full of stones to throw at the police in order to invite retaliation and gainworld attention.
The government accused renowned photographer cum rights activist, Shahidul Alam, of using Al Jazeera to spread panic by spreading rumours. He was arrested and allegedly tortured as well. There were allegations of foreign and foreign-funded NGOs backing the agitation to destabilize the country and bring about a regime change. Rumours about the governments desire to postpone the parliamentary elections using the unrest as an excuse were floated by the Western media.
The West and its media are none too happy with the Hasina governments increasing acceptance of Chinese investment in strategically important mega infrastructural projects.
Repression
But the government also has been intolerant towards the opposition. Repression appears to have become routine under the AwamiLeague regime.
According to Al Jazeera, since February this year, over 3,000 members of the opposition BNP have been put behind bars. The BNP alleges that over 500 of its supporters have been killed and nearly 750 abducted by the Police and thrown into jail since 2014. The party claims around 150 of its missing workers have either been killed in extrajudicial encounters or have been made to disappear.
The German think-tank Bertelsmann Foundation released a report that said that Bangladesh was now under autocratic rule. Bangladesh has been put in a list of 13 countries where the political situation has become significantly worse. The Bangladesh rights group Ain o Salish Kendra alleges that 519 people have disappeared since 2010, while over 300 people are still missing.
However, observers of Bangladesh point out that repression of opponents is not peculiar to the Awami League or to Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, but characterizes all regimes irrespective of the party involved.

Economic Issues
Street unrest has a deeper economic cause, irrespective of the issue which may have triggered it, says Afasan Chowdhury. And the Dhaka-based think tank, Centre for Policy Dialogue (CPD), has a report which identifies the politically relevant economic issues.
Analyzing the state of the Bangladesh economy in the fiscal year 2017-2018, the CPD says that accelerated GDP growth (7.5%) has not been translated into desired outcomes.
Employment elasticity of growth has declined significantly. Moreover, employment has not led to an adequate income for decent living. Thus, benefits of high growth have not reached all citizens of the country equally, the CPD observes.

The West and its media are none too happy with the Hasina governments increasing acceptance of Chinese investment
in strategicallyimportant megainfrastructural projects
Dr Debapriya Bhattacharya, a distinguished fellow of CPD, told the media recently that female workers and rural workers were facing a decline in their real monthly income while the unemployment rate among the youth with higher education is increasing. According to a CPD report, more than a third of the total youth labour force with higher education remains unemployed.
Bhattacharya said that the banking sector was plagued by financial scams, non-performing loans, inefficiency, and slack monitoring and supervision. Money laundering happens through the banking sector, the unstable capital market and high import payments, he pointed out.
The CPD report recommended reducing the personal income tax rate for the first slab to 7.5 per cent from the prevailing rate of 10 per cent.
Bangladeshs fiscal framework continues to be weak with a mismatch between targets and actual accomplishments. Revenue mobilization for the Financial Year 2018 has lagged behind the target.
Balanced Growth
Given the rising inequality in the rural areas and high food inflation, the CPD reiterates the need for guidelines to ensure food security and an incentive structure for farmers.
It also calls for labour-intensive, domestic market-oriented and local resource-based manufacturing and agro-based industry for the sake of creating more decent jobs with decent incomes.
Economy
Commentator Afsan Chowdhury says that issues relating to democracy are typically the concern of the urban intelligentsia and the Western-oriented folk. The urban and rural hoi polloi, who form the bulk of the Bangladeshi electorate, are guided more by their economic concerns, he claims.
Hence the importance of economic issues for the coming elections, he adds.

Speaker Karu Jayasuriya said today it was improper and unacceptable for some MPs to criticize his decision on the opposition leaders post and insult him via the media.
The Speakers office said in a statement that the tradition in democratic countries in the world was to accept the speakers ruling and if unable to do so to take further action democratically.
It said a decent society would not accept any criticism by MPs when the opinion given was not to their liking.
Speaker Jayasuriya has acted impartially and devoid of political interference since his appointment on September 1, 2015, the statement said.
It is unreasonable to make baseless allegations without realizing the background for appointments of previous opposition leaders and the present appointment which was the first appointment under the national government concept.
The speaker said he gave the ruling after studying the opinions expressed by the experts on parliament democracy, world parliamentary traditions, the countries representing the Inter-Parliamentary Union and the Commonwealth.

Addressing a news briefing, NFF Propaganda Secretary Muhammad Muzammil said since the Government was struggling to secure power and because it was in need of the participation and help of more MPs, it had promised this amount to be given to those MPs to gain their support.
At this juncture, the Government has realized that it lacks the support of the general public. Therefore, it thinks that the only option is to get the support of the MPs, Muzammil said
The MPs are being deceived promising that they would be given funds to monitor the development projects. However, the hidden agenda of the Government is to gain support to overcome power struggle, he added. (Sheain Fernandopulle)

Saudi Arabia takes a stand
	

A high-profile diplomatic spat has arisen between Saudi Arabia and Canada as a result of Canada expressing grave concern over the crackdown by Saudi authorities of human rights activists. 
Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman, de facto ruler in Riyadh, has recently been implementing a delicate reform process. While paving the way for social and economic reforms such as the removal of the ban on women driving vehicles and abolishing the male guardianship system, no plans are afoot to permit political activities in the kingdom.

The recent arrests of dissidents indicate, that his priority is to manage the politics around the reform process rather than public relations. Salman has warned Saudi women to refrain from abusing their newly granted freedom.
Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland recently tweeted in Foreign Policy Canada twitter page; Canada is gravely concerned about additional arrests of civil society and womens rights activists in Saudi Arabia, including Samar Badawi. We urge the Saudi authorities to release them and all other peaceful human rights activists immediately.

The Saudi Education Ministry announced that it will be arranging the relocation of over 15,000 Saudi graduate students currently studying in Canadain universities outside of Canada. Saudi patients receiving treatment in Canadian hospitals are to be moved to hospitals in other countries
The tweet referred to the arrest of several womens rights activists, including most recently of Samar Badawi, a Canadian citizen whose brother, Raif Badawi, had already been jailed in the country.These sentiments were retweeted by the Canadian Embassy in Riyadh.
The Saudi response was swift.The Ministry of Foreign Affairs claimed those arrested were lawfully detained, and accused Canada of blatant interference in the Kingdoms domestic affairs. It called the Canadian move an unacceptable affront and a violation of the Kingdoms sovereignty and ordered the Canadian Ambassador out of Saudi Arabia within 24 hours.It also recalled its own Ambassador in Canada. 
Several other measures were implemented to send a clear and unmistakable message to Canada and other nations who have been critical of Saudi Arabia. It froze trade relations with Canada and suspended all new trade and investments.The Saudi Education Ministry announced that it will be arranging the relocation of over 15,000 Saudi graduate students currently studying in Canadain universities outside of Canada. Saudi patients receiving treatment in Canadian hospitals are to be moved to hospitals in other countries. Saudi Arabian national carrier Saudia has announced the suspension of its flights to and from Toronto. The suspension of Saudia flights came as a shock for hundreds of Canadian Muslims booked to travel to Saudi Arabia to celebrate Eid-Al-Adha. 
A Saudi Foreign Ministry tweet stated; The kingdom of Saudi Arabia ... will not accept interference in its internal affairs or imposed diktats from any country. The Canadian position is an overt and blatant interference in the internal affairs of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and is in contravention of the most basic international norms and all the charters governing relations between states.
Canadas response to Saudi measures, communicated by Foreign Minister Freeland, stated: Canada will always stand up for the protection of human rights, very much including womens rights, and freedom of expression around the world. She further said. Our government will never hesitate to promote these values and believes that this dialogue is critical to international diplomacy.
Despite Canadas defense of human rights, it faces criticism over the USD 12 billion light armoured military vehicles deal signed by the previous Conservative government. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, once in office claimed his government was bound by the deal. Canada and other western crusaders rarely permit human rights issues to interfere with lucrative trade deals.
As the dispute deepens, Trudeau when asked if offering an apology to Saudi Arabia something he would consider responded, Canadians have always expected our government to speak strongly, firmly, clearly and, politely about the need to respect human rights at home and around the world. We will continue to do that.
At the other end, Saudi Foreign Minister Abdel al-Jubeir insisted, the issue was not one for mediation. He stated, There is nothing to mediate. Canada made a mistake and must fix it. 

The suspension of Saudia flights came as a shock for hundreds of Canadian Muslims booked to travel to Saudi Arabia to celebrateEid-Al-Adha
Bi-lateral merchandise trade between the two countries in 2017 amounted to USD 4 billion with a USD 1.2 billion positive balance in Saudi Arabias favour. Both Canada and Saudi Arabia are not in the top trading partners category of each other, and its disruption would not cause severe damage to either of the economies. 
However, Saudi Arabias choice in selecting Canada, a mid-level trading partner to send a clear warning to members of the international community is significant. 
Saudi Arabia may have appreciated a more subdued approach by Canada in the form of expressing its concerns through a ministerial visit. However, Canada opting for the use of Twitter, a type of megaphone diplomacy, was apparently not acceptable to the Saudis.
The strong response to the Canadian tweet is believed to have the support of most Saudis and will go a long way to placate feelings of those perturbed over Salmans lack of criticism of Israels aggression against Palestinians in the Gaza Strip during the recent months. 
It is reliably understood, that Canada has approached several close allies for assistance to cool down Saudi Arabias outrage. 
Even though the US government initially called on both countries to settle their dispute amicably, in a subsequent press briefing, State Department spokesperson Heather Nauert stated it is up to Canada and Saudi Arabia to resolve their differences. We cant do it for them. 
The current status of US-Canada relations may have even encouraged Saudi Arabia to take its current course of action. 
It is noteworthy, that not a single western European ally of Canada has spoken on its behalf and come to its defence. The deafening silence, especially from the likes of the British (also known to bring about Resolutions at the UNHRC against some countries for human rights violations), French and Germans is the clearest of signs, the Saudi warning has been taken seriously and none of these countries will act in a manner detrimental to their lucrative trade deals with Saudi Arabia.
On the other hand, UAE, Bahrain,Comoros, Djibouti,Egypt, Mauritania and Palestinian Authority have all expressed solidarity with Saudi Arabia and endorsed the Saudi position.

It may be recalled, that former Canadian High Commissioner in Colombo Shelly Whiting, in 2014 boycotted the annual Victory Day Parade held in Matara on May 18. Rather than declining the invitation which was her right, she went public issuing an unwarranted statement. After advising Sri Lanka to retire its annual Victory Day Parade, she ventured to lecture the government on how to handle reconciliation before concluding, I will not be in Matara. 
The then government, in its infinite wisdom, ignored the whole episode. It failed to adopt any of the measures available in the conduct of diplomacy to indicate displeasure, without being confrontational.
Saudi Arabia is not Sri Lanka.
In Saudi Arabia, Canada may have met its match!

Several injured in crash outside British Parliament
	
A man has been arrested and a number of pedestrians injured after a car crashed into security barriers outside the Houses of Parliament, Scotland Yard has said.
Streets around Parliament Square, Millbank and Victoria Tower Gardens have been cordoned off as dozens of armed police swooped on the scene. Officers could be seen surrounding the car before leading a man away in handcuffs. A number of ambulances were at the scene.
It is understood Scotland Yards counter-terrorism command is part of the investigation and is monitoring the situation. It is yet to determine whether this was a terrorist incident or not, and to then make that finding public.
A Downing Street source said it was too soon to give the incident any firm description.
Scotland Yard said: at 7:37 a.m. local time today, a car was in collision with barriers outside the Houses of Parliament. The male driver of the car was detained by officers at the scene. A number of pedestrians have been injured. Officers remain at the scene. (The Guardian)

Somesasunthary Krishnakumar A Historian, Feminist and a Friend
	
There are pillars of a society and there are the even stronger yet unseen foundations of a society. And that is how I think of my good friend Somesasunthary Krishnakumar (January 17, 1956  August 6, 2018). She was scathingly critical of Jaffna society, but was deeply committed to rebuilding it. Somes was a woman whose heart reached out to deprived and suffering women. A lecturer to many university students over the decades, a dissenter who lived through the war in Jaffna, a mother of five children and a supportive partner of her husband Krishnakumar. 
Somes belonged to the first batch of the Jaffna University in the mid-1970s. I remember her from my childhood as she was one of my fathers favourite students. That educational relationship with my father for decades, continued into many discussions between Somes and myself, and more recently with her daughters pursuing post-graduate education. During a formal meeting earlier this year, she introduced herself, as lecturer at the Jaffna University, and that she liked to proudly identify herself as someone who studied with intellectuals like K. Kailasapathy, K. Indrapala and S. Kadirgamar. Somes carried that tradition of commitment to education and intellectual engagement through the difficult war-times in Jaffna.
While I remember Somes as a child growing up in Jaffna, I reconnected with her after almost two decades, when I went on a short visit to Jaffna during the ceasefire period in 2002. I wanted to meet my fathers colleague and literary critic A. J. Canagaratna, who for almost two decades before he passed away in 2006 lived with Somes and her family. That is when I realised, that even as there was an exodus of Tamil intellectuals during the war, it was people like Somes and Krishnakumar, who kept a quiet but dissenting circle alive amidst a climate of fear and repression.

For the many meetings and discussions over the years relating to issues such as the legacy of the anti-caste struggles, on Tamil-Muslim relations and the socio-economic challenges facing Jaffna, Somes would without fail come on the back of the scooter driven by Krishnakumar. The two of them, known for their impeccable intellectual honesty, would make their points softly but forcefully. Somes wide understanding of the historical and sociological make up of Tamil society, would dispel many of the myths that underlie the conservative and nationalist discourse prevalent in Jaffna. 

With decades of experience of living through troubled times, she would caution against any quick moves to change society
Somes politics was both personal and public. For Somes, the most important aspect of the years after the war she would say, was that women like her did not have to worry about children being forcefully recruited into the war. Sometimes the only woman present in a discussion, when women were put down by a conservative proponent, she would shoot back with piercing questions. At the same time, with decades of experience of living through troubled times, she would caution against any quick moves to change society. Her approach was to step by step build the political space to have critical discussions and build a society that can again find the path of compassion and progressive aspirations. 
As her life became difficult with the onslaught of cancer, she fought it with courage despite tremendous pain. During our last meeting, a couple of months before she passed away, when she knew the end was near, she said with conviction and determination that she had no regrets about her life, and that she had lived it fully. Even at that moment, she wanted me to meet with a young woman, a friend of her twin daughters, who was interested in pursuing research. Her heart and mind fought hard to the end, never giving up on the personal and social challenges in life. For many of us who have learned so much from her, depended on her work and solidarity, and been nurtured by her warmth and smile, she leaves behind a void that cannot be filled.

Stop this crime of wasting public funds
	

One of the best cases in point in respect of arrogant attitude of politicians towards public funds is the attempt by the authorities of Western Provincial Council to purchase 125 chairs each worth Rs. 640,000 for the new chamber of the council at the new building complex of the council in Battaramulla. Upon a request by Janatha Vimukthi Peramunas Western Provincial Council member Lakshman Nipunaarachchi, Provincial Governor Hemakumara Nanayakkara has suspended the purchase on Saturday.
The council has 104 members including the Chairman but reports said the governor suspended the purchase of 125 chairs. These additional chairs may be to accommodate the additional members who would be elected/appointed under the new mixed electoral system after the next election for the council. The authorities at the provincial and the national level who are always clever in justifying any waste or national crime might justify the price of these chairs as well, but it does not seem to correspond with the lifestyle of the ordinary people of the province. That is why it causes one to raise his/her eyebrows.
Before this incident, the leaders of the Western Provincial Council created another controversy over another expenditure of Rs. 20 million the council had made for the painting of the portraits of six former Western Provincial Council Chief Ministers and the sitting Chief Minister to be installed at the new building with plaques and structural arrangements. Incumbent Chief Minister Isura Devapriya had said at a recent council meeting, the amount spent over the portraits was not as high as being reported by the media but they could not just hang the framed pictures of former chief ministers, as done in ordinary houses.

And there are moves to provide duty free vehicles for the provincial council members too.
The Western Provincial Council is going to spend such a huge amount of money from the public coffers on chairs at a time when there are hundreds of schools without drinking water facilities in the province. Education ministry says around 3000 schools lack toilets and around 2000 do not have drinking water facilities. According to UNICEF reports, 19% of schools in Sri Lanka lack adequate clean water and sanitation facilities and 1299 schools do not have any functional sanitation facilities. In spite of more popular and international schools being in the Western Province, the province has its share of schools without water and toilet facilities. 
The squander of public funds is not limited to the Western Provincial Council. It has been the norm of the public sector, especially the bodies with elected representatives. Sometime back JVP Uva Provincial Councilor Samantha Vidyarathna had made a startling comparison during an interview with a newspaper between the monies spent on a study tour by his council members and the allocation of money on the basic facilities of the people of the province. Vidyarathna had been quoted as saying that the Council had allocated Rs. One million for youth affairs, Rs.15 million for sports, Rs. Five million for housing, Rs. Five million for water supply and Rs. 9.7 million for estate infrastructure to be spent during the year 2016, whereas the amount allocated for foreign tours by the councilors alone had been Rs. 30 million. 
Members of many provincial councils go on such study tours. But we have never heard about any report prepared by any group of the Provincial Council members, who had gone on so-called study tours having presented in the Provincial Councils or to the Governors concerned, explaining the nature of the knowledge they had gained and how they would be going to utilise it locally.
 
Last week it was revealed 55 parliamentarians -- mostly belonging to the ruling party -- assigned to monitor the development projects, are given Rs. 200,000 each a month as transport allowances. The story of the Agriculture Ministry acquiring a building on rent is well known. The Ministry has been paying a staggering Rs.23 million as monthly rent for the building several months before the ministry occupied it. It is very clear that President Maithripala Sirisena cannot eliminate this attitude of politicians and public officials by travelling in ordinary flights during his foreign tours.

## Title: Strikes: Why the Govt. should sell off SOEs

Strikes: Why the Govt. should sell off SOEs  
	

It is not always easy to tell whether a wildcat work stoppage is an act of deliberate sabotage or a desperate act of last resort. Often, trade union activism in this country tends to have shades of both. 
Last week, locomotive engine drivers stopped work, bringing the railway services to a grinding halt for four days. Stranded commuters clashed with striking workers and damaged railway property. The strike was called off on Sunday after the President agreed to look into the salary anomalies, the main grievance of the strikers. During the same week, another strike by the government doctors left the hapless patients without treatment. The doctors were demanding an increase of their travelling allowance from Rs.35,000 to Rs.70,000. Journalists who pointed out the arbitrariness of the trade union action were labelled as traitors. The GMOA is reportedly preparing a traitors list, perhaps taking a clue from former Defence Secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa.
This kind of trade union vigilantism suggests that something is rotten within the system. When these same folks are up in arms against free trade agreements such as with Singapore and India, which would increase both the productivity and completion at home, that implies a bigger problem of ideological lowliness and self-centeredness in so called professional elites.
On the other hand, there is no gainsaying that Sri Lankas professionals are poorly paid, which has resulted in an exodus of the educated class, who are competing with the displaced Tamils to go to the greener pastures. The vacuum they left behind cannot be easily filled. At the end, when you pay with peanuts, you get monkeys to run the show. 
Public servants should be remunerated adequately; however, Sri Lankas economy is ill-equipped to sustain its overblown public sector and loss making public sector enterprises. Successive governments have enlarged an already bloated public sector workforce, filling up non-existent positions with acolytes, eroding productivity and damaging the economic well-being of employees who made an honest living. At the end, no one is happy.
There is no easy solution to this conundrum. When each disgruntled party resorts to trade union action, the government has acceded to their demands. However such ad hoc pay hikes, have created fresh salary anomalies within the public sector. Public sector salary bill has increased by a whopping Rs. 290 billion during the last three years, largely due to the Rs.10,000 increase offered to fulfil an election promise in 2015 and irregular salary increases agreed at various times to settle strikes.
 Still there are too many, idling mouths to feed with relatively limited allocations. During the last decade, public sector workforce alone increased by 39%, from 626,992 in 2006 to 874,395 in 2016. Those numbers are excluding the three armed forces, which also recorded a massive boost in the rank and file during the period. Then State owned enterprises (CEB, CPC, Railway, Sri Lankan Airlines etc.) are bleeding the economy white.

Successive govts have enlarged an already bloated public sector workforce, filling up non-existent positions with acolytes, eroding productivity and damaging the economic well-being of employees who made an honest living
The bloated public sector and the wastage of under performing SOEs mean that the government cannot pay a decent salary to those who do an honest job. Nor can it afford to invest in areas where it really matters. When schools and hospitals are under-funded, Sri Lanka is losing out probably the only positive legacy of post independent history. We will soon lose out to those emerging economies such as Vietnam in primary and secondary education. Repercussions of this under investment is already manifested in the poor performance of local universities in international ranking and low research output.
The country should get its priorities right;downsize its bloated public sector and sell a stake of its SOEs. Then, the savings should be invested in education, re-training, healthcare, and infrastructure which would increase the total factor productivity of the economy. 
The notion that fresh money would rejuvenate the loss- making SOEs is also open to question. Even after multi-billion rupees of investment, Sri Lankan railway and SLTB lag decades behind their peers in emerging market economies. CEB, CPC, the Srilankan Airlines are incurring billions of rupees of losses. The government does not have sufficient capital to refinance these institutions, nor the capacity to foster an institutional culture that support their resurgence. That is why the best practices of the private sector should be adopted and management of these ventures be transferred to the coperate sector.
Take for instance, perhaps the only sound economic decision of the Chandrika Kumaratunga administration: the liberalization of telecommunication industry. Those days of several years of backlog to obtain a telephone are long forgotten now. Today, Sri Lanka has one of the best telecommunication infrastructure, and the lowest tariff. Sri Lanka Telecom (SLT) has, somehow, survived and adopted to the competition, thanks to the earlier Japanese stake in the SLT. That is a pleasant departure from the past practice of fleecing the public for its survival.
Some of these loss making institutions are allowed to wallow in a deepening rot because, they are termed as strategic sectors- too important to hand over to the public sector and foreign competition.
Much of that terminology is nonsense. Sri Lanka should interpret strategic importance of these things relative to the countrys immediate and medium term priorities, and the assorted risk perception. Strategic cost of retaining these institutions are in fact much higher. Rather than trying to run these institutions by itself and then screwing up, the government should play the role of the regulator and enabler of the economy. 
However, privatization is not a politically easy proposition. A succession of political charlatans has nurtured a false sentimental value to the state ownership. Trade Unions are also hell bent on sustaining the good-for-nothing status quo. 
However, paradox of last weeks wildcat work stoppages and blackmail is that the public is gradually realizing the hollowness of the continuation of the rotten status quo in the public sector and SOEs. The government should make use of that new sense of public enlightenment. It should forge ahead with a new set of public sector reforms that would benefit both the public sector workers and the country.

Their delight made them forget the jumbo threat!
	

A onetime-hero whose name was a household word, this top team member had recently paid a visit to the backwoods of the paradise to look into the wild jumbo menace faced by the peasantry.

On hearing about the arrival of the top team member, the residents of villages like Aralaganwila, Weeralanda and Kandegama had made a mad rush to welcome him.
People had been so elated on seeing their onetime-hero in civvies come walking to meet them; they had mobbed him and started making inquiries about his general health and other personal matters as if they had got reunited with a long-lost family member!
These people had been so engrossed in a heart to heart chat with their distinguished guest for a long time, the wild jumbo threat and other common problems they are facing had taken a back seat in their minds.
And by the time they remembered that they had a lot of problems to bring into his notice, while he was with them, the guest had already left on the next leg of his official tour!

This lady is a terror to them!
	
There is a lady functioning as the deputy head of a money-making State undertaking who had to engage seven females as her private secretaries within a one- year period, they say.

This arrogant lady, typical of political appointees, is said to be such a terror to other female aides, every girl who assumed duties as her private secretary had quit the job a few weeks after assuming it, being unable to put up with her vicious attitude.
The lady is so heady with the political clout she wields, she does not give due respect to the head of the undertaking either, they say.
Once she had to lock herself inside her office room for several hours to escape the wrath of a crowd of heckling and jeering trade union activists.

Turkey takes action to curb currency crisis
	

Turkeys lira pulled back from a record low of 7.24 to the dollar on Monday after the central bank pledged to provide liquidity and cut reserve requirements for Turkish banks, but its meltdown continued to rattle global markets. 
The currency has lost more than 40 per cent against the dollar this year, largely over worries about President Tayyip Erdogans influence over the economy, his repeated calls for lower interest rates, and worsening ties with the United States. 
On Friday that relentless slide turned into a crash: the lira dropped as much as 18 per cent, hitting U.S. and European stocks as investors took fright over banks exposure to Turkey. 
The fresh lira collapse on Sunday night hit Asian shares, weakened the South African rand and drove demand in global markets for safe currencies including the dollar, Swiss franc and yen. Shares in Europes major banks also lost ground. 
The central bank, which surprised markets last month when it left interest rates unchanged despite double-digit inflation and the tumbling lira, announced the moves on liquidity and reserves after Finance Minister Berat Albayrak said authorities would start implementing an economic action plan on Monday.

Crash of the lira, row with US a plot: Erdogan
Daily Mail), 12 Aug 2018 -Turkeys President has slammed the crash of the lira as a political plot amid a row with the US and Donald Trump.
Recep Tayyip Erdogan said his country would instead seek new markets, new partnerships and new allies after Trump announced higher tariffs on imports from Turkey.
The aim of the operation is to make Turkey surrender in all areas from finance to politics, Erdogan told his party members in the Black Sea City of Trabzon.
The development comes after US President Donald Trump said on Friday he would be imposing a 20 per cent duty on aluminum and 50 per cent one on steel.

Will form broad political front with civil society - Samantha Vidyaratne
	

Uva Provincial Council Member of the JVP Samantha Vidyaratne shares his thoughts on future politics of his party and the struggle spearheaded by it.
Excerpts

Q You raised a lot of noise against the Uma Oya project. You, in fact, fielded a separate independent group representing the affected people to contest the local Government elections. It failed. Now, you are quite silent on the project. Why is that
It is a project with disastrous consequences on multiple fronts once implemented. Now, there are some structural changes introduced in the execution of the project. There is a mechanism to give relief to the affected people. We carried out protest rallies at grassroots level. We brought the struggle to the notice of the President. We took legal action. We got the project suspended on three different occasions. Of course, we wanted the Government to terminate the project. It could not be done, though. But, we forced the Government to take measures for the mitigation of damage caused in the execution of the project. Based on advice from the Norwegian expert whom the Government consulted, they altered the route of the underground canal. Plastering on the canal wall was also altered. There are certain changes to machinery used in dredging the tunnel. Machinery is changed in keeping with the soil condition. They have slowed the pace of construction. With the introduction of the latest technology, damage has been minimized. This is a project that violates human rights. People were denied access to drinking water, their livelihood.
Those who took the lead in the peoples struggle were fielded for the elections as an independent group. They did not succeed. People again got carried away by traditional political rhetoric. Those who led the struggle are now scattered a bit. Some are with us. It is a bit difficult for us to unite them all. At one point, people will be forced to team up with us again.
This is a project that spells doom. Further doom will fall once the project is completed.
Q The JVP which you represent suffered a setback all over the country at the last elections. What is the reason
Instead of calling it a setback, I would say the JVP could not perform to the extent expected by all including us. We also expected a better performance than this. Society also did the same. Yet, we did not reach the expected level at the election. Peoples political decisions are shaped by the prevailing circumstances. It does not happen in the way we think only. Our peoples literacy rate is good. Yet, we are still poor at political wisdom. Those who advocate racism can still make headway in politics. It is easy to capture power by cashing in on religious and racial sentiments of people. That is backward thinking. So, it is an arduous task for us to reach our political targets.

We will tie up with anyone accepting these policies. We want citizens to join us. Suppose, there is an intellectual working for Mr Mahinda Rajapaksa

Q In our country, we see some parties driven by populism and adaptable to public sentiments. There are some other political forces trying to stick to their ideologies without adaptation to public sentiments. What does your party advocate
Our society has a specific need. We are driven by it.
Q What is that needin your view
You referred to two matters. One is politics based on populism. The other is to convince people to embrace the ideologies followed by the party concerned. In our case, we have a vision to be achieved. We want to lead society in that direction. We do not believe in giving inducements for vote catching. We have our own vision on economy, environment and communal harmony. We have painted our vision and translated it into policies. Today, the country pays dearly for following popular politics since Independence. The economy is in ruins. Racism and religious fanaticism have raised their head. Moral values of people have eroded. We need to work out a mechanism that can find solutions to all these social and economic ills.
The traditional political party system cannot address it. There are people who love and care for the country. May be they are not affiliated to any party. During the last elections, we witnessed how some civil society movements became so influential even challenging the status of political parties. In addition to the political parties, these civil forces played a pivotal role in unseating the Rajapaksa rule. We believe that such forces have a role to play in building the country. Casting aside traditional politics, we thought of forming a broad front that comprised such personage. We need to include those who are honest, dignified and anti-corrupt. That is the path for us.
Q Are you referring to the civil society organizations such as the National Movement for Social Justice that campaigned for good governance at the last 2015 Presidential Election
There are civil persons and organizations having links with the political parties. We do not intend to tie up with them. We will formulate policies. We will tie up with anyone accepting these policies. We want citizens to join us. Suppose, there is an intellectual working for Mr Mahinda Rajapaksa. If he is ready to join us accepting our policies, we will welcome him.
QThe JVP cherished certain policies since its inception in 1956. But, the JVP still occupies a distant third position in national and local politics. How do you intend to change the long- standing policies of the party in the new political journey
Only the media have ranked the political forces in this manner. According to our interpretation, there are only two forces. The United National Party (UNP) and the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP), in our view, are on the same footing when it comes to their economic policies.
They use racism and religious fanaticism as and when required for their political ends. They represent the capitalist class. We, in the left, are the only alternative force. In that sense, there are two political camps in the country. The world is also going through a crisis. Capitalism has no solution to peoples issues. There are acute problems in the world.
People are warring against each other. There are multinational companies exploiting people. The drug menace is out of control. It means the world is in a quandary being unable to solve problems. The present system has caused enormous damage to the environment. We need an alternative.

That is a system ensuring equality to all mankind and meting out justice to all beings. Capitalism cannot find solutions to it. We advocate socialism
QDoes it mean that the JVP still believes in Socialism as the only means
Yes, it is clear. We need to change the social system. Yet, there is a global reality today. Taking it into account only, we can proceed. So, we cannot look back to the 1917 communist model, Chinese system, Cuban model etc. Ours is not like that.
We need social revolution that is in line with the current global trends and needs. That is a system ensuring equality to all mankind and meting out justice to all beings. Capitalism cannot find solutions to it. We advocate socialism.
QIs the proposed JVP-led front capable of achieving it
There are social ills. We need to evolve a system that can cure all these ills permanently. For that to happen, we have to win over people. We need to do what is best at this juncture. The formation of this front is one such step forward.
QIn Capitalism, there is market-driven manufacturing. Yet, in Socialism, it is driven by social needs, not profit. Today, only the marketdriven model is followed all over the world. What is the policy of your political front that is in the making
We are working out our policies at the moment. It is not appropriate for me to spell out the policies now. It is in the process. Society needs to move forward. It cannot remain stagnant. We need scientific innovation. Innovation in the world today is not used solely for the common good of people. Though it is said that everything is done to keep society happy, it is not the case. Society is not happy as a whole eventually. May be, people enjoy the luxury of having quality garments, vehicles etc. But, most people are not happy.

The world is also going through a crisis. Capitalism has no solutionto peoples issues. Thereare acute problems in the world
QYour party has moved to introduce the 20th Amendment to the Constitution. How is it linked with the policies of the new political front
If we form a Government, the present constitution will undergo drastic changes. Yet, the 20th Amendment is todays requirement. A total revision of the constitution is impossible now. We brought the 20th Amendment to change a system that is sine-qua-non in todays context. All the past leaders pledged to abolish the executive
presidential system.
QThere is criticism that the JVP is doing this at the behest of the UNP. What is your response
We have to ask as to why these critics are opposed to the 20th Amendment. If they criticize us as being the cats paw of the UNP in this regard, they virtually admit that the UNP would come to power next time. We do not believe in it, though. In 1994, former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga promised to abolish the Executive Presidency. Did she act in favour of the UNP then
Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa also did the same in 2005. Does it mean that Mr Rajapaksa wanted to do a favour for the UNP These critics see the 20th Amendment as a barrier for a person in their mind to become the President. They pin hopes on someone to become the President. As things stand at the moment, those who are in the Rajapaksa camp are opposed to their dream President.
QYet, it became obvious that the JVP acted in the interests of the UNP in the enactment of legislation to postpone the provincial council elections. Actually, the UNP benefited from it finally. How do you respond
We do not act for the benefits of the UNP or the President. Those who criticize us see us as an impediment to them in upholding their political cause. We are only concerned about the public benefits. There is criticism on the current electoral system. It is a distorted system that enables only moneyed candidates to win elections.
We never intended to postpone elections. In fact, we supported the enactment of that piece of legislation on condition that the electoral system would be changed within the stipulated time to conduct polls. The Government only broke that promise. Now, we have to struggle for early elections.
QThe political complexion of the JVP was nationalism at one time. The JVP stood for the development of local industries. The party also agitated against foreign interference. Also, the JVP played a role in the war against separatism. Now, there is a school of thought that the JVP is heading for neo-liberal policies. What is your view
There is an attempt to create a public opinion to that effect in some circles. The JVP has not deviated from its founding ideals.We strive for Socialism. Yet, we have to take into account the present ground realities in pursuing our target. Unless we adapt ourselves to the changing circumstances, we will become a political force that is extinct.

They use racism and religious fanaticism as and when required for their political ends. They represent the capitalist class. We, in the left, are the only alternative force. In that sense, thereare two political camps in the country
QWhat about nationalism you once advocated
When armed separatism was at its height, we appeared to be a force of nationalism in clear-cut terms. We had to take certain action as the situation demanded. We eliminated terrorism.
Now, we have to win over people in the north. We indulged in the anti-imperialist struggle. We do it even today. Nationalism is raising its head globally. We foresaw this trend. At one point, the world will be globalized under a communist system in the future.
QThere is an allegation that your leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake has become a stooge of the UNP. What is your view
All our past leaders faced such criticism. We have not become the cats paw of any political party. The group that criticizes us in this regard has links with Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and President Maithripala Sirisena. That is to cover up their cases.
