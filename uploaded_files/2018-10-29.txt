Change in political landscape to create short-lived hype at bourse: Industry experts
	
Industry experts say the Colombo bourse is expected to have vibrant activity today, following the sudden and unexpected change in the country?s political landscape, but the majority opined the hype would be short-lived.
Although the swearing in of former president Mahinda Rajapaksha as Prime Minister last Friday is expected to result in improved activity in the capital market, such may come down in the coming days with foreign investors predicted to pull out.
While local sentiments will be gung-ho, the same will not be from foreign investors who perceive the current situation in the country as chaos, expressed top stock industry representatives to Mirror Business.
?It is unpredictable and uncertain at the moment. We will have to wait and see how things unfold. It will be interesting to see how the market opens and the kind of reaction there would be from foreign investors,? said Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) Chairman Ray Abeywardena, expressing concerns on the possible spillover effects of the changes in the political landscape will have on the bourse.
Reflecting similar sentiments was?NDB Capital Holdings Limited and CSE immediate past Chairman Vajira Kulatilaka, who pointed out that what Sri Lanka essentially showed on Friday was a ?very separate aspect of risk in the country? to the world, which was not witnessed in recent decades.
?This is something to be worried about as it can happen again and again.
?However, my gut feeling is that the market will run with locals dumping money; but that will not be for long,? said Kulathilaka.
Meanwhile, the Colombo Stock Brokers Association (CSBA) expressed confidence in the capital market reaching greater heights as the swearing in of a new Prime Minister on Friday affirmed some sense of political stability creeping into the country.
?Basically we have a better understanding of what that political future will be going forward. Politically there is some stability returning to the country and that is crucial for our market to perform,? said CSBA President Prashan Fernando.
With the promise of certainty in the political landscape by next month, Fernando believes that improvements will be witnessed in the capital market. He expressed confidence that starting today, there will be more positive vibes and dynamism in the market, as people (locals) were looking forward to some catalyst.
?What we were waiting for was the return of retail activity. Retailers were also staying out of the market given the sentiments at that time.?
?Hopefully with renewed political vigour and some stability in the horizon, retailers will come back and I hope the government pension funds, EPF and ETF that was to return, will do so sooner than later,? added Fernando.
Candor Group Director Ravi Abeysuriya, too expressed optimism in the market performing better starting today and said it is likely for the bourse to show improved performance.
?The market will do very well. It is a sentiment, and you can see a change. Friday did show some increased activity and I presume there will be lot more vibrant market activity.?
On Friday, the market closed with a share volume of 19,628,445 and a turnover of 1,472,983,502. The All Share Price index went up 63 points, one of the highest daily average jumps witnessed as of late while the more liquid S&P SL20 index went up 70 points. (Shabiya Ali Ahlam)

Changes in SL are internal affairs: China
	
China on Monday said the changes in Sri Lanka are internal affairs?and it?believes?that the Sri Lankan Government,?political parties and people have enough wisdom to deal with the internal situation, the NDTV reported.
Asked about China's stand on the current political crisis in Sri Lanka considering that Beijing has made huge investments in the country, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang has said China is following the crisis closely.
"China and Sri Lanka are friendly neighbours. We are closely following the changes in the situation in Sri Lanka. The changes in Sri Lanka are internal affairs. We believe the Sri Lankan Government,?political parties and people have enough wisdom to deal with the internal situation," he said.
China, he said will always follow the principle of non-interference in internal affairs of other countries.
On question about the Chinese Ambassador in Sri Lanka Cheng Xueyuan meeting both Mr Rajapaksa?and Wickremesinghe, Mr Lu said "we have maintained communication with relevant political parties in Sri Lanka.?Chinese Ambassador met respectively Wickremesinghe?and the new Prime Minister and exchanged views on bilateral relations with the two,"
The reference Mr Rajapaksa as "new Prime Minister" by the spokesman was seen as significant by the observers considering that Mr Wickremesinghe?maintains that he is still the Prime Minister, the NDTV said.

GMOA to urge new Health Minister to investigate charges on Rajitha
	
The Government Medical Officers? Association today urged the Health Minister that is to be appointed to immediately investigate the charges on former Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne.
Addressing a press conference, GMOA Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge said a Presidential Investigation Committee should be appointed over the matter.
Despite properly acquiring the Dr. Neville Fernando Teaching Hospital (NFTH), Dr. Aluthge said former Minister Senaratne had pumped over Rs 250 million to the institution wasting the public funds.
He further said that during the tenure of Dr. Senaratne as the minister, several anomalies had taken place in the tender process when purchasing drugs.
Dr. Aluthge urged that the benefits received by the former minister directly and indirectly related to his decisions as the Health Minister while neglecting the technical decisions by the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) should be investigated.
The GMOA said that further delay in investigating the former minister would allow him space to destroy or amend documents related to the charges.
Therefore, Dr. Aluthge said that the newly appointed Health Minister should take adequate permanent measures to safeguard the Health Sector in the future.?(Thilanka Kanakarathna)

Let Stability Be Restored - EDITORIAL
	
?
n late October 26, the Sri Lankan polity was thrown into crisis when in the aftermath of the ?United People?s Freedom Alliance? (UPFA) -- one of the parties within the governing ?United National Front? Government -- withdrawing from the governing coalition, President Maithripala Sirisena unexpectedly appointed the de facto leader of the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP), former President Mahinda Rajapaksa as Prime Minister.?
Accepting the premiership Rajapaksa claimed he was doing so in the interests of the country. The new premier supporters emphasised that when Rajapaksa was voted out of office in the aftermath of the 2015 presidential election, he accepted his defeat and left his residence at ?Temple Trees? by early morning, thus ensuring a peaceful transfer of power. They called on the earlier Premier Ranil Wickremesinghe? to do the same and warned that failure to do so would force them to bring their supporters to ?Temple Trees? and force him out.? ?
Simultaneously, President Sirisena issued notice of dismissal on Premier Wickremesinghe demanding he stepped down from office with immediate effect. He also issued gazette notifications proroguing parliament until November 16. Mr. Wickremesinghe rejected the presidential directive. He stressed that under the 19th Amendment to the Constitution, the President had no power to remove him from the post of Prime Minister. He emphasized he remained Prime Minister and would continue to act so until such time as his government maintained its majority in parliament.? ?
Mr. Wickremesinghe?s colleagues and supporters warned that the other members of the ruling coalition stood behind the earlier Prime Minister?s decision and called on supporters to gather at ?Temple Trees? in a show of strength.? ?
This situation brings to mind events which occurred in then ?Belgian Congo? in 1961?
-- Congo, one of the world?s mineral rich countries -- where then President Mobutu and his Prime Minister Patrice Lumumba, were at loggerheads with one-another. The turmoil saw foreign intervention in the affairs of the Congo, the entry of foreign troops, the murder of Premier Lumumba, coups and counter coups which left nearly 100,000 dead. Worse was to follow, on the one hand, various regions of the original Congo broke away from the mother country. While the other Congo became the focal point of cold war adversaries -- the Soviet Union which backed the Premier and the US which backed the President. Over 100,000 died in the ensuing power struggle between the cold war powers and their local client rulers.? ?
Today a fairly similar situation exists in this country. The rivalry between India and China has put this country squarely into the middle of their power games. China has invested heavily in this country and we are heavily indebted to them. Already theharbour at Magampura? has been leased to a Chinese entity, while the airport at Mattala -- derogatively described as the emptiest airport in the world -- is under discussion for leasing to an Indian entity.? ?
To make matters worse the Colombo Port which was to be developed in collaboration with the Indians under an agreement signed between the Indian Government and the Government of Sri Lanka is being opposed by the President, who also accused the Indian intelligence agency -- Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) -- of planning to assassinate him.? ?
The US is concerned over the growing Chinese power in the Pacific and Indian Ocean region. In fact US Vice President has referred to the Mahagmpura port as a Chinese naval base.
The people of this country have been through two Janatha Vimukthi Perumana (JVP)-inspired bloody uprisings in 1971 and again in 1989. The country is just recovering from the bloodbath brought on by the terrorist outfit the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) who were attempting to divide the country and left the nation?s economy in shambles. The people do not deserve this new political crisis brought on by politicians, which in the end, is nothing more than a power struggle, more aptly spelled out in the Sinhala idiom ?balalobithwaya?.?
Already the US and a number of countries have expressed concern at the expanding political crisis. The UK has warned its citizens of visiting the island -- a body blow to our tourism industry.? ?
The last thing we need is to become entangled in international power struggles. Sadly, our politicians have been seen to put self before country, we would like to remind them of the lines in Sir Walter Scott?s ?Lay of the last Minstrel?.?
?Breathes there the man, with soul so dead, Who never to himself hath said, This is my own, my native land!?

LVL Energy Fund set to expand its portfolio with the development of 7 solar power plants
	
Utility Scale Grid Connected to Solar Power Sri Lanka
Leading energy company and a subsidiary of Lanka Ventures, the LVL Energy Fund PLC is set to expand its alternative energy footprint with the development of seven new solar power projects. The plants will be set up in partnership with First Energy SL (Pvt) Ltd, in strategic locations across the island and will have a collective capacity of 7 MW of solar energy.
With several hydro, wind and thermal energy projects already in operation, these are the first solar power plants to be added to the company?s portfolio. The new plants are estimated to cost a total of Rs. 1.2 billion and are part of the LVL Energy Fund?s long-term strategy to diversify its energy offering and strengthen its position as a leader in the alternative energy arena.?
The plants are being set up in response to a tender launched by the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB), calling for the setting up of 90 power plants with a capacity of 1 MW each. Constituting the LVL Energy Fund?s total solar power contribution of 7 MW is the 3 MW plant which will be located in Maho, the 2 MW plant which will be situated in Pallekele as well as the Mathugama and Embilipitiya plants which will each generate 1 MW. Connected to 4 grid substations in the above locations, each power project is to be developed on a Build, Own & Operate (BOO) basis. The tenure of power purchase agreement for each plant is 20 years, and the entire implementation and set up process of the power plants is estimated to take approximately six months upon receiving all approvals.
Commenting on the LVL Energy Fund embarking on its first-ever solar power projects, Sumith Arangala ? CEO, LVL Energy Fund stated: ?We are on our way to setting up our first-ever solar power plants and we are very pleased to be diversifying into this highly sustainable and fully eco-friendly source of energy. Solar power is the ultimate energy resource of the future, and we are privileged to play a role in shifting Sri Lanka?s dependency from non-renewable energy resources such as fossil fuels, to renewable and more environmentally-friendly options that are less taxing on the planet.?

LVL Energy Fund PLC was incorporated in June 2006 as a subsidiary of Lanka Ventures PLC with an initial capital of Rs. 300 million. The main objective of the company was to invest in projects in the power and energy sector in Sri Lanka and across the region. Up to June 2016 the company held several rounds of fund raising which culminated in a total fund base of Rs. 2,636 million by 31st March 2017. Thereafter the company held an IPO to raise a further capital of Rs. 1,200 million and obtained a listing for shares at the Colombo Stock Exchange. The company remains a well-diversified entity with investments in renewable and thermal power projects in Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and Nepal, and is set to help usher in a new era of sustainable energy use.

New PreMier appointment: it?s legal and constitutional
	
?
he United States (US) and European Union (EU) have issued statements requesting the Government to act according to the constitution. However, Ranil Wickremesinghe continues to pursue his claim as the Prime Minister and that his removal was unconstitutional. Both the removal and the new appointment are published in the Government Gazette.? ?
Articles (sections/Art) herein are as amended by the 19th Amendment to the Constitution.? ?
There are two possible arguments establishing the correctness and the constitutionality of the act of the President in appointing Mahinda Rajapaksa as the Prime Minister.? ?
Argument 1
The President is the Head of the State, Head of the Executive and of the Government, and the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces (Art.30). He gets executive power directly from the people at the Presidential Election. People?s Sovereign power of franchise is exercised at the election of the President (Art.4) Sovereignty of the people is inalienable (Art.3). The People entrust executive power to the President with the expectation that he would use such powers for their benefit: This is a fundamental duty and the responsibility of the President. The Constitution vests in the president the authority to decide the best manner in which such powers are to be executed through the machinery of the Government. Therefore, the constitution confers sole authority on the President (the head of Government) to decide as to the composition of the Cabinet of Ministers.??
The Cabinet of Ministers is charged with the direction and control of the Government (Art. 42(1). The cabinet is collectively responsible and answerable to Parliament (Art. 42(2). The President is a member and also the Head of the Cabinet (Art. 42(3). In order to empower the President with the maximum liberty and authority, the constitution vests in him the discretion to decide the Prime-Minister. Article 42(4) provides as follows:??
?The President shall appoint as Prime Minister the Member of Parliament, who, in the President?s opinion, is most likely to command the confidence of Parliament?? ?
The opinion of the President cannot be questioned or tested. He is expected to evaluate the prevailing condition and decide the person in the best interest of the people and the country. The President is expected to take into consideration all the circumstances and information at his hand in formulating his opinion.? ?
He who has apparent authority to ?Command parliament? may not be the same person who can ?command the confidence? of Parliament. In the present scenario, Ranil Wickremesinghe claims that Parliamentary majority is still with him. He does it by taking a physical count of the number of parliamentarians of his party. He assumes that he has the commanding authority over his party members of parliament.? ?
On the other hand the President may have evaluated the confidence of the members on different grounds. He can consider other sources of information such as intelligence reports to do a practical evaluation. In other words the constitution expects the President to apply as an objective test in formulating his opinion. Finally the President seems to have held the opinion that Mahinda Rajapake (MR) commands the confidence of Parliament.? ?
The correctness of President?s opinion can be witnessed with the increasing number of UNP members declaring their willingness to support MR. ?Confidence? in the constitution is based on the ?free will? of the members. Such ?confidence? reflected in Article 42(4) is different from the number of party parliamentarians on whom an artificial force a leader of a party may employ.??
The best precedent is the appointment of RW (himself) in January 2015, when UNP was still having only few seats in the Parliament. Ranil was appointed even without officially removing the incumbent Prime Minister, D. M. Jayaratne. Ranil accepted the portfolio without any allegation of any procedural unconstitutionality. Thereafter the new cabinet was appointed. Today he faces the same situation as Jayaratne did in 2015. Therefore RW is stopped from criticizing the same procedure as unconstitutional, from which he benefitted in 2015.
Logically there cannot be two members in the parliament who can command the confidence of Parliament simultaneously. Therefore, with the appointment of MR as the Prime Minister, the removal of RW happens automatically. Principles of interpretation of laws provide that whenever any law gives powers to appoint, it includes the powers to remove also. This principle is embodied into section 14(f) of the Interpretation Ordinance of Sri Lanka.?
Therefore it is clear that the President has lawfully appointed MR as the Prime Minister in terms of Article 42(4) of the Constitution read with section 14(f) of the Interpretation Ordinance.? ?
When the Prime Minister ceases to hold office by removal or otherwise, the Cabinet of Ministers shall become dissolved by operation of Article 48. However, there is a crucial discrepancy between the Sinhala and English texts of the Constitutions. The word ?removal? is stated only in the Sinhala text. When there is an inconsistency between two texts, the law directs to consider the Sinhala version as prevailing over the English text. The act of ?removal? of PM can only be done by the President. Such removal is constitutionally recognized in Articles 47 and 48 (Sinhala text). Therefore with the publication of the Gazette removing RW from the office of Prime Minister, the Cabinet also became dissolved by operation of Article 48. Therefore there is no cabinet of ministers functioning under the premiership of RW from October 26, 2018.?
Argument 2
Ranil Wickremesinghe seems to be relying on Article 46(2) of the constitution, which reads as follows;??
?The Prime Minister shall continue to hold office throughout the period during which the Cabinet of Ministers continues to function under the provisions of the Constitution unless he-??
(a) Resigns his office by a writing? ?under his hand addressed to the President; or??
(b) Ceases to be a Member of Parliament?.??
It is argued ? prima facie-that this Article leaves no room here to remove the Prime Minister. Even if Article 46(2) was treated in isolation, still it is subject to the condition ?throughout the period during which the Cabinet of Ministers continues to function...? It means once the cabinet was dissolved(for whatever reason) the Prime Minister too would cease to hold office by operation of law.? ?
Until October 26, 2018, Sri Lanka was governed by a (purported) ?National Government?, which was created with the passing of the following resolution of the Parliament on September 3, 2015.?
?Whereas the UNP, which obtained the highest number of seats in Parliament has formed a National Government, Parliament determines in terms of Article 46(4) of the Constitution of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka that the number of Ministers in the Cabinet of Ministers shall not exceed 48 and the number of Ministers who are not Cabinet Ministers and the number of Deputy Ministers shall not exceed 45.???
?National Government means a Government formed by the recognized political party or the independent group which obtains the highest number of seats in Parliament together with the other recognized political parties or the independent groups? (Art. 46(5).
The previous cabinet exceeded the limit of 30 under the authority of the Parliament obtained under the aforesaid resolution passed in terms of Article 46(4) of the Constitution. The largest constituent party joined UNP to form the national government was SLFP, which again is a constituent of UPFA. On October 26, 2018, the UPFA withdrew from the national government. As a result the Parliamentary sanction granted under Article 46(4) to the UNP to maintain a cabinet of ministers above the limit of 30 also came to an end. In such circumstances, the cabinet of Ministers ceased to have constitutional authority to function from October 26, 2018. Accordingly in terms of Article 46(2), Ranil Wickremesinghe, Prime Minister (of the National Government) discontinued to hold office from that date.? ?
Therefore in the absence of a Prime Minister and a Cabinet of Ministers the President had no legal obstacle to appoint Mahinda Rajapaksa as the next Prime Minister of Sri Lanka.??
Appointment of Cabinet of Ministers
As the present portfolios are structured to meet the requirements of a National Government, they have to be redefined in compliance with Article 43(1) to meet conditions of a non-National Government. In doing so, the President has to consult the Prime Minister. President appoints ministers on the advice of the PM (Art 43(2). The President will not incline to consult or get advice from Ranil as his recognition as PM is now ended. President has already issued official advice to the state officials confirming the dissolution of the previous cabinet of ministers.? ?
Therefore, the appointment of Mahinda Rajapaksa as the new Prime Minister is both lawful and consistent with the constitution. On the other hand there is no legal basis in the claims of Ranil Wickremesinghe.??

Paradise Lost? Preliminary notes on a Constitutional Coup
	
?
here were three dramatic announcements on the evening of Friday October 26, 2018 from the Presidential Secretariat, which occurred in the following order: (a) the announcement of the withdrawal of the UPFA from the government; (b) the swearing-in of Mahinda Rajapaksa before President Maithripala Sirisena as the Prime Minister; and (c) the announcement that the President has informed Ranil Wickremesinghe in writing that he has been removed from the office of Prime Minister under Article 42(4).
Even if the legality of the procedure and the clarity and meaning of the relevant constitutional provisions can be debated, the fact that the event was planned in complete secrecy, with no consultation of Parliament or giving the serving Prime Minister and Cabinet the courtesy of even a short prior intimation before the course of action was made public, that it was suddenly carried out on a Friday evening, and that it has taken the country by total surprise, points to some extremely questionable motives.??
?
"The crisis will be prolonged if Rajapaksa cannot swiftly demonstrate his command of Parliament, but the strategy he and Sirisena have followed tonight shows that they have chosen to seize the political initiative and momentum by the element of surprise"
Indeed, the whole set of circumstances suggest not the way a change of government ought to occur in a democracy, but the sharp practices associated with a constitutional coup, which is likely to lead to a constitutional crisis. It is a constitutional coup because the serving Prime Minister has not legally ceased to function in office before a new Prime Minister has been appointed. And it will lead to an unprecedented constitutional crisis because there are now two competing Prime Ministers and their parties jostling for power, authority, and legitimacy at the very heart of the state. Until one of these persons ? Mahinda Rajapaksa or Ranil Wickremesinghe ? can demonstrate that he has the confidence of Parliament through the support of a majority of MPs, and force the President to accept the will of Parliament, the crisis will not be resolved. Only time will tell what long-term damage this does to Sri Lanka?s constitutional fabric.??
After the 19th Amendment, which was enacted in 2015, the Prime Minister can only cease to hold office by death, resignation, by ceasing to be a Member of Parliament, or if the government as a whole has lost the confidence of Parliament by a defeat on the throne speech, the budget, or a vote of no-confidence (Articles 46(2) and 48). Since the Constitution after the 19th Amendment specifies these ways in which the Prime Minister ceases to hold office, and has impliedly removed the previous power of the President to remove the Prime Minister at will, it follows that there are no other ways in which this can happen. In particular, the President can only appoint another Prime Minister where the serving Prime Minister has lost office in any one of these ways.??
?
"Indeed, the whole set of circumstances suggest not the way a change of government ought to occur in a democracy, but the sharp practices associated with a constitutional coup, which is likely to lead to a constitutional crisis"
It is clear that the serving Prime Minister has not ceased to hold office in any one of these ways. Rather, the President has purportedly removed the Prime Minister from office by acting under the provisions of Article 42(4), which states that the President shall appoint as Prime Minister the Member of Parliament, who, in the President?s opinion, is most likely to command the confidence of Parliament. The President seems to have taken these words rather too literally than is constitutionally permissible. When this provision speaks of the President?s opinion, it contemplates not the subjective and personal opinion of the President as to which MP is best suited to be Prime Minister, but an objective and constitutional view formed by reference to who can command the confidence of Parliament. This is usually, although not always, the leader of the largest party represented in Parliament.??
?
	President removed the Premier from office under article 42(4)
	
	
	PM?s removal would lead to a constitutional crisis
	
	
	Both Ranil and MR have to prove their majority in parliament
	
	
	According to 19A, the PM can only cease to hold office by death, resignation or by ceasing to be an MP
	
	
	It is not clear why MS, MR didn?t choose to take the constitutional path to remove Wickremesinghe
	
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe survived a vote of no-confidence by a substantial majority earlier in the year. No other canvassing of Parliament?s confidence has occurred since then, or before the purported appointment of Rajapaksa to night, and therefore the President can neither constitutionally remove a Prime Minister who has not lost the confidence of Parliament nor appoint another in his place.??
It must also be stated that Article 42(2) speaks only of the appointment of the Prime Minister by the President and says nothing about the removal of the Prime Minister by the President. While the power of dismissal could be assumed as inherent to the power of appointment in the constitution prior to 2015, the 19th Amendment has changed this by now providing expressly for the specific ways in which the Prime Minister can be removed (under the previously noted Articles 46(2) and 48). That these procedures have not been followed render the purported presidential acts tonight illegal and unconstitutional.??
?
"The 19th Amendment specifies these ways in which the Prime Minister ceases to hold office, and has impliedly removed the previous power of the President to remove the Prime Minister at will "
If the parliamentary numbers have changed since Wickremesinghe?s no-confidence vote in April in favour of a majority now supportive of Rajapaksa by, among other things, the withdrawal of the UPFA from the national government ? presumably the basis for tonight?s presidential acts ? then it is also not clear why Sirisena and Rajapaksa did not choose to take the constitutional path to removing Wickremesinghe by defeating him in Parliament first. The crisis will be prolonged if Rajapaksa cannot swiftly demonstrate his command of Parliament, but the strategy he and Sirisena have followed tonight shows that they have chosen to seize the political initiative and momentum by the element of surprise, with the probable intention of consolidating their hold on the state machinery and in particular the police and armed forces over the weekend, before conforming to constitutional and parliamentary niceties. They would also quite correctly have concluded that technical illegalities would not effectively be justifiable, because it is unlikely in the extreme that the Sri Lankan courts would risk a venture into such a high-stakes political game.??
This kind of behaviour of course is entirely normal in Rajapaksa, and to his credit, he has never pretended to be anything other than a banana republic presidential populist. But Sirisena was elected in 2015 exactly to instantiate changes to curtail this dubious and destructive strain in Sri Lankan politics. His descent from the heroic standard-bearer of high idealism to a despised villain of the lowest form of low politics has been truly Miltonian.

Prez utters unbelievable stories to cover up his fault: RW
	
President Maithripala Sirisena utters stories, not even a child would believe, to cover up his faults such as the appointment of Mahinda Rajapaksa as the Prime Minister, UNP Leader Ranil Wickremesinghe said today.
In a special public statement delivered this evening, Mr. Wickremesinghe rejected all allegations levelled against him and his Cabinet by the President on Sunday.
?In the history of Sri Lanka, there has not been a crisis like this which has befallen the country as a result of the President?s decision. The appointment of a MP from a minority group as the PM is unconstitutional and illegal,? he said.
He said this unfortunate situation could have been solved by parliament but it was prorogued in an unethical manner.
?The speaker said the proroguing of parliament was wrong. Citizens, civil society organisations and the international community want us to act within the Constitution. This is not good for Sri Lanka. We managed the economy well but it is now collapsing,? he said. (Yohan Perera)

Right from its inception, Sampath Bank has continued to be intently awareof the evolving needs of businesses and consumers around the island and strived to offer financial solutions that are aligned to them.Hence, going beyond offering higher interest rates to senior citizens, twice a month, the Bank seeks to assist them with the growing medical expenses that they tend to face through the Sampath Sanhinda Saver account and the medical rewards in particular.
Credited directly to theirSanhinda Medical Benefit cards, accountholders can use these funds to make payments for all services at Rajya Osusala (State Pharmaceuticals Corporation), Asiri Group of Hospitals, Durdans Hospital, Hemas Hospitals, Nawaloka Hospitals, Lanka Hospitals, Nawinna Medicare Hospital, Northern Central Hospital, CDEM Hospital, Singhe Hospital, Matara Co- Operative Hospital,Pannipitiya Private Hospital,Metropolis Laboratories, Harcourts Pharmaciesand Vision Care Opticians.
Furthermore, accountholders can avail special discounts at select partner hospitals on their Sanhida debit cards.
?Drawing inspiration from Sri Lankan society?s regards for elders and our tradition of caring for them, we dedicated the Sampath Sanhinda Saver account to the nation?s senior citizens in 2009. And it has been our privilege to continue to serve them through it,? said Ms. Nadi B. Dharmasiri, Head of Marketing, Sampath Bank PLC. ?Staying true to its motto of ?thepromise of a better tomorrow?, every element of this account has been purposefully designed to meet the unique needs of customers over the age of 55 and we have been adding more features and benefits to it over the years to suit their evolving lifestyles. Thanking them for placing their trust in us, we are delighted to reward our Sanhinda Saver accountholders with close to Rs.120 million in medical benefits this year.?
The Sampath Sanhinda Saver account is yet another means by which Sampath Bank seeks to offer greater value and convenience to its customers through the golden years of their lives. The medical benefits, being offered based on the annual average account balance for 10 consecutive years now, are just one of the many privileges accorded to accountholders.Accountholders also receive a higher rate of interestfor their foreign currency (USD) Sanhinda Saver savings accounts.Thus, the Bank continues to go beyond its call of duty to stand by its customers in every step of their lives, through its path breaking services and outreach efforts.

Samsung Galaxy A7 launched: Specs, features, price and everything you need to know
	
Samsung has been a major force in smartphone camera innovation for a while now. Its Galaxy phones, especially top-tier flagships, have some of the best cameras you can find on a smartphone today. The company has been focusing on bringing some of its flagship technologies to the lower end of its portfolio as well, which is why we see the Infinity Display coming all the way down to the Galaxy J series. Samsung has been doing something similar with its camera technologies as well. On Thursday, however, the company surprised everyone by announcing a triple camera phone in its Galaxy A series.
The Galaxy A7 is the first phone from Samsung to sport a triple lens setup. It also happens to be the second phone after the Huawei P20 Pro to come with triple cameras. With this, the company is touting an impressive photography experience along with a sleek design and some useful features in a phone that will fall in the mid-range segment. Here's everything you need to know about the Galaxy A7.
Samsung Galaxy A7 specifications
Display: The Galaxy A77 sports a 6.0-inch FHD+ (1080x2220) Super AMOLED Infinity Display

Two Constitutional Coups applauded by two different social segments
	
?
eather would be stormy and rainy in the next few days to come, said a forecast last Saturday. It would not be much different in the political arena as well. Opening up more and better space in promoting the ?Crown Prince? began with a ?Constitutional Coup? on Friday last week in the night, that seeks to oust, sitting PM Wickremesinghe and his government. Whole world was caught unawares when the de facto leader of the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP), more popularly known as the ?Pohottuwa? party, Mahinda Rajapaksa, was sworn in as PM, by President Sirisena. The path to power is thus widened for Namal Rajapaksa, this time with more grooming and better positioning in all probability. Yet in a way, it wasn?t surprising either. Sirisena played ?Judas? almost four years ago, and he played it once again. No change of principles here.
The process began with a letter signed by Minister Mahinda Amaraweera as General Secretary of UPFA, informing the PM, the UPFA would no longer be a partner of the present government. This was in fact to say, the ?yahapalana? government is no more a ?National? government, and that PM Wickremesinghe will thus have no majority on his own. Yet the MoU for a ?National? unity government was signed between the UNP and the SLFP and not between the UNP and the UPFA. But the political factor that goes beyond the technicalities and legal interpretation is that, once the UPFA withdraws, SLFP a constituent party that contested under the UPFA goes along with it and out of the ?National Unity Government?.
With that it is assumed, PM Wickremesinghe is restricted to 106 votes in parliament including the 12 MPs from SLMC and Rishad Bathiudeen?s ACMC, which is not the majority in the 225 member parliament. For Ranil to prove he has a controlling majority, he would now have to depend on the TNA, while the JVP has already said, they would not support either side in this Constitutional conflict. TNA itself is in a dilemma. Though Sampanthan and Sumanthiran blindly believed Ranil Wickremesinghe led government would deliver on the promise for a new Constitution with more devolved power than under the 13th Amendment, especially the Northern and Vanni Tamil people live with much disappointment and growing frustration with this government, as they were with the MR government. Thus, with Wigneswaran, now tipped to lead a new political party in the North with a campaign on Tamil people?s unsolved issues, how many TNA MPs would now vote with this government to save Ranil is very much a riddle.
All that counted, President Sirisena went ahead with the ?deal? that was worked out over dinner at S.B. Dissanayake?s residence, early this month. Mahinda Rajapaksa was sworn in as PM under clause 42(4) that says,?The President shall appoint as Prime Minister the Member of Parliament, who, in the President?s opinion, is most likely to command the confidence of Parliament.?Most ?democratic and civil rights? campaigners forget, that this very same clause was used on January 9, 2015 to swear in Wickremesinghe, then Leader of the Opposition as PM with only 43 MPs behind him and while D.M. Jayaratne was still the PM with a majority in parliament.
?
"For Ranil Wickremesinghe to prove he has a controlling majority, he would now have to depend on the TNA, while the JVP has already said, they would not support either side in this Constitutional conflict"
It is now known that in January 2015, PM Jayaratne was coerced and manipulated to provide a back dated resignation letter to fit in with Clause 46(2)(a) of the Constitution, while this time, President Sirisena removes Ranil Wickremesinghe with a single sentence using the same Clause 42(4) that has to be read along with Clause 46(2)(a) to have Constitutional meaning proper. It wasn?t done that way then in January 2015 and it wasn?t done now. And in both occasions, it remains a ?Constitutional coup? in changing political power without the consent of the people and by using the Constitution the wrong way that violates the ?sovereignty of the people?. In these ?Constitutional Coups? it is always pre-decided to get back to the Constitution thereafter with a majority negotiated and manipulated in parliament to be in line with Clause 42(4). In January 2015, this blatant violation of the Constitution was applauded and accepted by the Colombo ?civil society? leaders while the Sinhala Buddhist majority was left numb and helpless. Now in October 2018, the lower layers of the Sinhala Buddhist society light crackers and enjoy ?kiribath,? while the Colombo?civil society? leaders remain dismayed and helpless. In both instances, the ?sovereignty of the people? wasn?t even thought of as non negotiable.
There is yet a political factor that makes October 2018 different to that of January 2015. In January 2015, the Constitutional Coup was played out with the euphoria in Colombo over ousting President Rajapaksa, whose rule was painted black in a single stroke. That violation of the Constitution was applauded and accepted by the urban middle-class as a step towards furthering ?democracy?. In October 2018, the Constitutional Coup is still in play endorsed by the Sinhala Buddhist majority and with the Colombo middle-class, though frustrated and betrayed by this ?Unity? government, still prefer the Wickremesinghe-government to any led by Rajapaksa. Unfortunately for the UNP this urban middle class remains passive and would not intervene as a political force to save the UNP government.
This ?October Constitutional coup? is thus played out within the parliament, for which the parliament now remains prorogued. It is certainly a time buying factor to increase numbers. It cannot be now turned around with ?international pressure? as the UNP leadership wants to. Every hour Rajapaksa is consolidating himself as PM though outside Temple Trees. He probably had India and Modi neutralized with his most recent trip to New Delhi. He was greeted as PM and wished by the Chinese Ambassador in Colombo. Statements made so far by other important Western countries that the UNP banks on, have only asked for peace and to adhere to the constitutional process. Sadly, they mean very little to a PM who banks on the Sinhala Buddhist majority.
In short, with the UNP not pinning faith on their own supporters to challenge this Constitutional Coup and the urban middle class stay grumbling in their comfort zones, while Rajapaksa fiercely usurps power within a seemingly constitutional process, the final result is almost there at our doorsteps. He is with 95 MPs that he campaigned and brought to parliament in August 2015. Whatever is being said about Muslim and plantation sector representations in parliament, with Rajapaksa consolidating himself, they can and will change positions. This parliament is not one with firm loyalties. We have politicians who have not only jumped over fences, but have crept through fences. Politicians who have crossed over to be Ministers in every government since 1994. Politicians the people vote to parliament every time they cross over.?
This certainly would leave us with a Constitutional coup that would be endorsed in parliament with a manipulated majority that in essence is a violation of people?s sovereignty, the people do not perceive as such. The promise therefore would be to give the people their sovereign right to elect a new government, perhaps early next year. That would be applauded too in this society.

Unchanging ideals of the United National Party
	
?
s an UNPer born and bred I?m as proud to be an UNPer now as I was way back when in my youth.
One might ask why? It is because the party has always been for every citizen in this country, irrespective of race or creed.
It has never been a racist party. It has always unwaveringly stood for democracy, freedom, justice and the rule of law. The UNP in the Senanayake era always had someone from a minority community as Chairman.?
At that stage, it was the late DR M.C.M. Khaleel. Although this was changed later, Ranil Wickremesinghe has later appointed Kabir Hashim as Chairman of the UNP.
The late D. S. Senanayake, was before my time, but in reading about him, and also about my great-grandfather, the late Charles Henry de Soysa, who was one of the first members of the Ceylon National Congress, from which stemmed the UNP, I have gained immeasurable knowledge about the Father of the Nation and what he stood for. Presentations on screen are always shown at UNP events at Sirikotha at which all past leaders of the party are honoured, by displaying their words and deeds for the present generation to learn about them and their vast contributions to the country.
I am also aware that two of the late DS?s closest advisors were the late D.R. Wijewardene and the late C.L Wickremesinghe, both grandfathers of Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, the present leader of the UNP. I knew the late Dudley Senanayake well, worked under his leadership before my marriage and later with my late husband, Chandra Karunaratne, to whom he was a mentor and who was one of his closest supporters. We stood by the late Dudley through the crises he faced from both within the party and outside it.
He will always be my favourite politician, who made me become a Director of the Board of the Dudley Senanayake Foundation. We have a memorial oration for him annually, with the partnership of the Friedrich Naumann Stiftung.
Last year the distinguished orator was Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe who kindly gave us the use of the Banquet Hall at Temple Trees for the event.
He stressed on the incomparable contribution to the development and progress of the country by Dudley Senanayake and his father before him. As one who knew the late Dudley?s thoughts on politics, I know that he too would have been proud of the party and the present path it treads through both stormy and calm waters. There were indeed charges of corruption at that time too, against Ministers.??
Like the Senanayakes, DS and Dudley, the UNP today headed by Ranil Wickremesinghe, also steadfastly believes that each one should be honoured according to his/her own worth, not categorized, penalized or suspected because of race or creed.?
Our Leaders both then and now, have always spoken the truth, never made false promises, walked the straight path.
Both the late Dudley then and Ranil now were and are used to winning and losing and treating ?those two imposters just the same?.
The UNP headed by the Senanayake?s and at the present moment, have ensured that the country was ruled democratically and according to the rule of law, whenever in power. This has been always been a characteristic of the UNP and it has not veered away from this course, whatever the circumstances may have been.
The party has never failed in respecting the right of every individual to fair and just treatment.
The UNP today, believes as it did then, that the greatest feats of man have been the achievements of a free and unfettered mind. The UNP has always believed that economic freedom can only be built on the foundation of political freedom which we have now achieved to a certain extent.
As well as being a UNP supporter all my life, I have been closely associated with the party as my late husband was an MP, a Deputy Minister, and a member of the working committee from the time of the late Dudley till he died in 1997.?
?
"Blunt misrepresentation of facts and abuse of truth used time and again will not deter the UNP in its journey forward under the present Leader who has groomed an excellent second string which no other party possesses. Something the late Dudley said remains forever in the recesses of my mind."
I was also a member of the working committee for a few years till 2016. The party I have always supported through thick and thin, through defeat and victory has never changed from the ideals, values and principles of its founders. Times have changed but not the party. It is wrong to compare cabinets now with those of the late DS and the late JR.?
These were solely UNP governments which were won with vast majorities. The many problems existing today were nonexistent then.?
We did not have a long drawn out war. The county was not plunged into debt by the extravagances of a former dictatorial regime and nor had it made enemies of countries in the democratic world in those days.
I?m sure former President Chandrika Kumaratunga would say that the SLFP isn?t the same party as that begun by her late father. We did not have a situation when power was misused to the extent it was during the last regime with state power being used to abduct, to kill, to intimidate.?
There are ways of tackling problems that have to change with the evolving of different situations through the passage of time, but the values and ideals remain the same.
Blunt misrepresentation of facts and abuse of truth used time and again will not deter the UNP in its journey forward under the present Leader who has groomed an excellent second string which no other party possesses. Something the late Dudley said remains forever in the recesses of my mind.?
That he prays and hopes for the day when every citizen of this country can state with pride; ?This is my own, my native land?.
I know that the present leader of the UNP feels the same way too. I have always been and will remain an UNPer till I die, because it is the only party that I believe can take this country forward with pride to new beginnings, sticking to the ideals that the founders instilled, stood for and believed in.

UNP mulls impeaching President
	
United National Party (UNP) yesterday said it is contemplating bringing in an impeachment on President Maithripala Sirisena but had not made any final decision on it.
UNP MP Sujeewa Senasinghe told a media briefing at Temple Trees that an idea has been mooted to bring in an impeachment motion but no final decision has been made on it.
? Some have proposed an impeachment motion on President but no decision has been made on it,? Mr. Senasinghe said.
At the same time he said his party is willing to hand over the reigns to a new Prime Minister if it manages to show a majority in the House in a decent manner. ? We will go home if the matter is sorted out in a decent manner after convening Parliament,? he said.
He also said this is a matter which concerns all citizens of the country and not an issue which only UNP leader is facing. ?We urged the people to fight for their sovereignty in the midst of this political court,? he added.
Referring to the defections from UNP, he said this was natural as former President will try to woo MPs to obtain a majority in Parliament. ?Some might be even bought over for money,? he said while highlighting that UNP still have a majority in Parliament. He said UNF definitely has a majority in the House and will prove it shortly.
Nalin Bandara Jayamaha who referred to a question raised by the journalists as to whether there was a move to arrest Mr. Wickremesinghe on the attempt to assassinate President Sirisena, said there is a proper procedure for such a thing. ?You cannot arrest anyone without proper evidence,? he said.

US issues security alert for its citizens in SL
	
The US on Monday issued a security alert for its citizens, who are in Sri Lanka, after taking into consideration the current political developments in the country.
In a statement, the US Embassy in Colombo advised US citizens of an increased likelihood of political turmoil, civil unrest, and demonstrations as a result of the President?s decision to dismiss the Prime Minister and suspend parliament.
?The Embassy reminds citizens that even demonstrations intended to be peaceful can turn confrontational and escalate into violence. You should avoid areas of demonstrations and exercise caution if in the vicinity of any large gatherings, protests, or demonstrations,? it said.
The Embassy asked US citizens to avoid the areas of the demonstrations, exercise caution if unexpectedly in the vicinity of large gatherings or protests, monitor local media for updates, be aware of surroundings and keep a low profile.

We will take to the street: UNP
	
While highlighting that they will bring in an impeachment motion against President Maithripala Sirisena, UNP senior Ministers and MPs yesterday said they will take to the streets and protest against what they called a constitutional coup and the proroguing in Parliament.
They conveyed this information at media briefings held in Temple Trees from time to time.
Leader of the House Lakshman Kiriella said he had written to Speaker Karu Jayasuriya asking him to convene Parliament. Asked as to whether Speaker has the power to convene Parliament, he said speaker is an independent person and does not work under the executive and therefore has the power to do so.
Asked about the move to bring in an impeachment motion against President, Mr. Kiriella said the party will initially get Parliament convened.
Minister of Law and Order Ranjith Manduma Bandara confirmed that an impeachment motion against the President. Deputy Minister Sujeewa Senasinghe, MP Mujibur Rahaman also said an impeachment motion would be brought in against the President.
Minister of Justice Talatha Athukorala said they will keep Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe in power. ?We will not allow Mr. Wickremesinghe to leave Temple Trees,? she said.
All the state Ministers, Deputy Ministers and MPs of the UNP claimed that they have a majority and go for street protests on Tuesday. They warned that the situation of the country will take to the worse if the matter is not discussed and sorted out in Parliament in a decent and democratic power.
Asked about the defections from the UNP, she said almost all who defected will then come back. (Yohan Perera)
