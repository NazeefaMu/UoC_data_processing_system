More protests planned against Port City resumption- Environmentalist
	
As the stage is set for the commencement of the Port City Project after the recent visit of Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, the Peoples Movement against Port City is planning more protests against the project in the days to come.
The joint coordinator of the Movement and Environmentalist Hemantha Withanage told Daily Mirror that they have planned for more street protests if the government goes ahead with it. We are currently engaged in educating the fishermen in Negombo and Colombo about the adverse effect the port city project will have on them but we will have to take to the streets as the last precaution if the government goes ahead with it, Withanage said.
The government should stop lying to the people of promising a brighter future through this unsustainable development businesses, he said while adding that there are no regulations in place to control an off shore financial market at the moment though such an activity is to be carried out in Port City. There is a danger that it might become a centre for money laundering and illegal commercial activities, he further said. (Yohan Perera)

SL housemaid murdered in Oman
	
A Sri Lankan migrant housemaid in Oman had been found murdered in a city, out of Muscat, the Capital of Oman, Sri Lanka Foreign Employment Bureau officials said.
They said that the housemaid was not registered with the Sri Lanka Foreign Employment Bureau (SLFEB).
Foreign Employment Minister Thalatha Atukorale told the Daily Mirror that the Ministry was coordinating with the Omani Police and the Sri Lankan Mission in Oman to get more information into the death of the housemaid.
According to reports, the housemaid had been murdered by slitting her throat few days ago.
Minister Athukorala said the Sri Lanka Foreign Employment Bureau could not take up the responsibility of bringing back the body since she had not been registered with the SLFEB.
Despite our unwavering effort to educate the Sri Lankan women on hazards of migrating to overseas via unregistered agents, it seems to be continuing. Some of them are still going for overseas without following the proper channels at the Bureau. It makes us very difficult to contact them in times of emergency, the Minister said.
However, she said according to the reports received so far, the woman had been allegedly murdered by a Pakistani man, after a dispute between them about a clandestine affair of the woman with another man.
However, Ms. Atukorale said the details were yet to be confirmed by the Sri Lankan Ambassador in Oman Mr. Padmanadan.
The Foreign Employment Bureau implemented a regulation, with effect from January 1 that the Bureau would no longer make any effort to bring back Sri Lankan housemaids from abroad, if they had not registered with the Bureau prior to their departure.
With this regulation, any housemaid, who had gone abroad for employment without registering with the Bureau, would not be brought back at state expense even in case of ill health, mistreatment by employers or their bodies, in case of death. (Piyumi Fonseka)

Sweat it out in May as well
	
The Sri Lankan population will have to put up with the uncomfortable situation they have to undergo as a result of excessive sweating during the month of May as well, where winds are unlikely to become active till around that time, the Department of Meteorology said today.
A spokesman from the Department told Daily Mirror that the winds are not likely to get active till end of May.
The uncomfortable situation is caused by lack of winds. The perspiration is dried up when the wind blows and that does not happen when the winds are inactive and thats why the people are feeling uncomfortable, he said.
However, the temperature which is high these days is also likely to go down by next month. Despite this the Department predicted an increase of temperature in most of the areas. Accordingly the temperature in Anurdhapura which was 36.4 yesterday was predicted to be 37C degrees by today while the Temperature in Colombo which was 32C degrees was likely to increase up to 34C. The situation is expected to be same in Ratnapura where the temperature was 34.9C was expected to rise up to 36, Galle from 32C to 35C and Jaffna from 35C to 36C degrees.
Thunder showers were predicted at several places over most provinces after 2.00 pm. Fairly heavy rainfall (above 50mm) are also likely at some places in the coming days. Few showers were expected to occur in the North-Western, South-Western and Southern coastal areas in the morning too.
There may be temporary localized strong winds during thunder showers. The general public is kindly requested to take adequate precautions to minimize damages caused by lightning activity. (Yohan Perera)
