British PM May to fire starting gun on Brexit
	
?
Prime Minister Theresa May will file formal Brexit divorce papers , pitching the United Kingdom into the unknown and triggering years of uncertain negotiations that will test the endurance of the European Union. ?
Nine months after Britons voted to leave, May will notify EU Council President Donald Tusk in a letter that the UK really was quitting the bloc it joined in 1973. ?
The Prime Minister, an initial opponent of Brexit who won the top job in the political turmoil that followed the referendum vote, will then have two years to settle the terms of the divorce before it comes into effect in late March 2019. ?a ?Now that the decision has been made to leave the EU, it is time to come together,? May will tell lawmakers, according to comments supplied by her office. ?
?When I sit around the negotiating table in the months ahead, I will represent every person in the whole United Kingdom ? young and old, rich and poor, city, town, country and all the villages and hamlets in between,? May will say. ?
On the eve of Brexit, May, 60, has one of the toughest jobs of any recent British prime minister: holding Britain together in the face of renewed Scottish independence demands, while conducting arduous talks with 27 other EU states on finance, trade, security and a host of other complex issues. ?
The outcome of the negotiations will shape the future of Britain?s $2.6 trillion economy, the world?s fifth biggest, and determine whether London can keep its place as one of the top two global financial centres.

CERT warns of dangerous computer virus carried by emails
	
The Computer Emergency Readiness Team (CERT) today warns computer users to beware of a dangerous computer virus received in many forms as it was fast spreading throughout the internet and there was a risk of it infecting any computer through emails.
Speaking to Daily Mirror, CERT Chief Information Security Engineer Roshan Chandragupta said the virus mainly infected to computers through emails.
?Five incidents have been reported in the country so far of infection by the computer virus but there may be more incidents which have not been reported to us or detected yet,? he said.
After the virus infects a computer, all information and data in the computer, including video files, would be encrypted (the information and data is converted into a code which cannot be read).
No way has been found so far to decrypt (convert the unclear messages to a readable format) or recover the lost data using any software. The computer has to be reformatted (prepare the chosen computer hard drive partition to be used by an operating system by deleting all of the data and settings in a computer system) and the operating system reinstalled.
The virus was identified as ?ransomware? and it was so described because the virus was designed to demand a ransom of a certain amount if the virus was to be removed and the encrypted data recovered.
However those who had paid the ransom had not had their data restored by the creator of the virus .
Therefore Mr. Chandragupta advised all the computer users to be wary of opening suspicious emails that contain highlighted documents such as newsletters, video attachments, PDF documents and bogus lottery winning results? etc.
He also advised computer users to backup all their valid data and information on to external storage devices.
?Also do not backup information or data while using emails, because there is a likelihood of infecting the backup devices as well with the virus. It is essential to keep the installed virus guards up-to-date. Reports had revealed several virus guards can defeat the virus. But many incidents of infection by the virus were reported even of computers with up-to-date virus guards,? Mr.Chandragupta said. (Chaturanga Pradeep)

Fishermen cross boundary, fish in SL waters: Indian Naval Staff Chief
	
Indian fishermen have been crossing the maritime boundary and fishing in Sri Lankan waters, Chief of the Indian Naval Staff Admiral Sunil Lanba said in Vellore on Wednesday.
According to The Hindu, he has said a dialogue is going on among fishing associations of Sri Lanka and Tamil Nadu in this regard.
Meanwhile, he has said the Navy has been tracking and monitoring Chinese submarines in the Indian Ocean.
At a press conference after a programme to mark the decommissioning of the Tu-142M long-range maritime patrol aircraft after 29 years of service and the silver jubilee of INS Rajali at the naval air station in Arakkonam on Wednesday, he said the Chinese had been deploying submarines in the Indian Ocean since 2013.
Admiral Lanba said the Tu-142M had ?extensively flown in the airspace around Sri Lanka when the country was fighting the LTTE?.
He recollected the crucial role played by the squadron in Operation Cactus in the Maldives, when fleeing mercenaries were detected and tracked till they were apprehended by Indian warships.
On coastal security, he said that after the November 26 terrorist attacks in Mumbai, the Navy was made overall in-charge of maritime security.

Govt. betrays armed forces: MR
	
The Government?s resolve to implement the UNHRC resolution is an act of outright treachery practiced against the armed forces and the people of Sri Lanka, former president Mahinda Rajapaksa said today.
In a statement on the UNHRC resolution, he said the yahapalana government pledged to implement the entire resolution it co-sponsored in October 2015 and thereby renewed its earlier undertaking to establish a war crimes tribunal with foreign judges, prosecutors and investigators, to remove through an administrative process members of the armed forces suspected of war crimes even if there isn?t enough evidence to take them before a judicial inquiry, to repeal the Prevention of Terrorism Act and to replace it with a law acceptable to Western powers and to permit the war crimes tribunal and other mechanisms set up in Sri Lanka to obtain funds from overseas.
?Though the President and Prime Minister repeatedly say that no foreign judges will be brought to try our armed forces, the pledge given in Geneva last week was exactly the opposite. The most dangerous aspect of the UNHRC resolutions of 2015 and 2017 is that the Sri Lankan government has accepted without any reservations the report of the Office of the High Commissioner on Human Rights (OHCHR) of September 2015 which had accused the Sri Lankan government of a whole range of war crimes including indiscriminate killings of non-combatants, torture, rape, illegal detention, abduction and deprivation of humanitarian assistance.
There was no compelling reason for the yahapalana government to have accepted the OHCHR report other than their own inherent anti-national attitude. In 2010, the UN Secretary General commenced an inquiry against Sri Lanka and its report was published in April 2011. My government resolutely refused to accept that report and today, nobody even remembers that such a document existed.
The UN Secretary General can appoint a panel of experts to advise him on a country only on the instructions of the UN Security Council. Yet, under pressure from the Obama administration, Ban Ki Moon appointed a panel of experts to advice him about Sri Lanka without the sanction of the Security Council thus going against the practices in the UN that had evolved over seven decades.
The investigation against Sri Lanka by the OHCHR which began in 2014 had similar issues of legitimacy. When the UNHRC appoints a Commission of Inquiry to go into the situation in a country, the members of the commission are appointed by the President of the UNHRC who is the ambassador of a member nation. But in the case of Sri Lanka the inquiry panel was appointed by the UN Human Rights Commissioner - a second tier UN official, not by the President of the UNHRC,? he said.

JHU against creating Speakers in PCs
	
The Jathika Hela Urumaya (JHU) said today it was against the proposal to name the post of Chairman and Deputy Chairman in Provincial Councils as Speaker and Deputy Speaker stating that it would lead to separatism and political insecurity.
JHU National organizer Nishantha Sri Warnasinghe said the proposal made by the Provincial Council Chairmen to change their posts had been approved in all nine provincial councils and submitted it to the Local Government Minister Faizer Musthapha.
He said even provincial council members partial to former President Mahinda Rajapaksa in the seven UPFA driven provincial councils out of the nine had also agreed to the proposal despite claims to represent for country?s unitary state and sovereignty.
?The proposal was approved in all nine provincial councils. Only we and the JVP voted against it. We see this as a move to strengthen separatism. This would create nine speakers in all nine provinces and nine parliaments in line with the country?s parliament. This is a serious matter. We will not agree to any proposal which promotes separatism. We represent only moves that strengthen political stability and unitary status,? he said.
He said it was the Western and Northern Provincial Councils which had brought in proposals detrimental to the country such as scrapping powers of the governor.
?We are against the provincial council system. We have not supported any proposal made to strengthen provincial councils. Strengthening of Provincial Councils was a threat to the unitary state and political stability in the country,? he said. (Ajith Siriwardana)

LB Finance launched an innovative finance product recently by introducing LB Gift Store, in partnership with Mydeal.lk, Ltd, a pioneer in the Sri Lankan e-commerce industry.
The LB Gift Store enables the fixed deposit and savings account customers of LB Finance to choose their desired gifts by accessing www.lbstore.lk, which is an exclusive site, catering to the LB Finance customers. The e-voucher that is given at the time of placing the deposit provides access for selecting the gift.
?Instead of a physical item given by the company, we are giving the opportunity for the customers to choose whatever they desire through this e-voucher,? Customer Relationship Manager Nisansala Hapuarachchi said.
Deposits AGM Bharatha Pathirana said that this is a significant day for the financial sector of Sri Lanka as this novel and innovative product provides goods and services to the customer through an Internet platform offered by a financial institution.

That is the uniqueness of this, which is offered for the first time in Sri Lanka. It is offered to all deposit customers from March 29,? he said.
?The customer gets an e-voucher on the spot when they deposit. From the voucher the customer can log in to LB Gift Store from anywhere in the world and any time purchase gifts available in the gift store. Also more than 10,000 goods and services are available,? he added.
He also said that if the customer wants to get more than the voucher value, the rest of the payment could be paid through the credit/debit card or else with cash at the time of receiving the product. ?IT AGM Chethana Kahandagoda said that this is a combination of innovation and technology and they will come up with more innovative services and products in the future. LB Finance Deposits Deputy General Manager Marlon Perera said that the customers of all ages, be they senior citizens, kids or young professionals, will benefit from this initiative and these offerings will be available all year round, with added promotions to be held from time to time.?

Lyca takes legal action against MP Charles Nirmalanathan
	
International mobile phone giant Lyca Group yesterday issued a legal notice to MP Charles Nirmalanathan for making number of defamatory and false allegations through a South Indian-based TV station ?Puthiya Thalaimurai,? against their housing project that was scheduled to be opened by South Indian film idol Rajinikanth.
The legal notice issued to the MP Nirmalanathan demands that the comments are immediately withdrawn, an apology is issued and damages of 250 million Sri Lankan Rupees are recouped.
The village, located in Sinnnaadampan and Puliyankulam in the Vavuniya district contains a community centre and 150 houses, each with two bedrooms, a kitchen and a toilet, Lyca said in an official statement.
The group stated that Lyca?s Gnanam Foundation has no political agenda as claimed by the MP and the project was only an aid programme for a charity solely intended to support the local community, and the allegations are therefore baseless and unfounded.
Superstar Rajinikanth however cancelled his visit to Sri Lanka and rejected unveiling the Village, which the former had stated due to political lies and rumours and unwanted media attention made.
However, the statement sent by Lyca noted that the Foundation will continue its charity work and the Village will be ceremoniously opened as planned with the keys being handed over to the new occupants.

Sepala Rathnayake, who was also a member of the Tender Board dealing with the issuance of Treasury bonds, revealed today before the Commission that he was shocked due to the consequences that could arise, when the Board was required to accept Rs. 10.058 billion worth bids for the Treasury bond auction on February 27, 2015.
When questioned, he said at the Tender Board Meeting, the Superintendent of Public Debt Department explained to the Board members about the intervention of former Governor Arjuna Mahendran, as he had instructed the Public Debt Department (PDD) to accept 10 times the amount of bids advertised in the public notice.
It was explained that the February 2015 bond auction was originally intended to sell 1 billion rupees ($7 million) of 30-year bonds.
And following the auction, on the instructions of Former Assistant Governor Rathnayake, the PDD recommended to accept bids worth Rs. 2.6 Billion.
However, disregarding the recommendation of PDD to accept only Rs. 2.6 billion, the former Governor had unusually visited twice the PDD while the auction was taking place and had instructed to accept Rs. 10.058 billion amounts of bids.
It was also revealed, when the recommendation was before for the approval of the Tender Board, former Assistant Governor Rathnayake had rejected to accept such amounts of bids because of the consequences and the impact which could occur to the market interest and the public debt management.
?At the Tender Board meeting, I asked the chairman of the TB to contact the Governor immediately to discuss the situation. Then the chairman, Mr. Samarasiri attempted to contact the Governor via the intercom telephone line but said that the Governor was not in the office?, he said.
Subsequently, the Chairman of the Tender Board had left the room and had come after few minutes, and informed the Tender Board members that he contacted the Governor and he was instructed to accept the so-called amounts of bid by the Governor.
?I was dissatisfied with the response of the chairman and I expressed my stance by saying that ?better to leave clothes here and go naked to sign this?, he had said it in the Sinhalese language to the Tender Board members.
Using economic statistical drafts prepared by him, former Assistant Governor also illustrated to the Commission the consequences that had actually occurred to the market interest, auctions for the T-bonds and bill and the loss for the Government, after the acceptance of the Rs. 10.058 billion worth bids on February 27, 2015.
Deputy Solicitor General Priyantha Navana led the evidence on behalf of the Attorney General today .Further inquiry will be conducted from April 3.
The Commission which was appointed by the President comprised with Supreme Court Judges Kankanithanthri T. Chitrasiri, Prasanna Sujeewa Jayawardena and former Deputy Auditor General Kandasamy Velupillai to inquire into the Treasury Bond issue. (Shehan Chamika Silva)

The great escape!
	
Eleven elephants have been saved from drowning after they were rescued from a flooded bomb crater after being stuck for four days.
Environment workers said the elephants were discovered almost fully submerged on a wildlife reserve in Cambodia on Friday.
Word was then passed to wildlife agency WCS whose members arrived the following day to dig a channel up the side of the crater so the animals could climb out.
The head of Cambodia's environmental officer in eastern Mondulkiri province, said the animals had been trapped for three days before they were found.
They said the pack likely wandered into the 10ft deep hole in order to drink, but were then unable to get out again.
Rescue workers had to dig out the side of the pit, which was created by a blast during the country's bloody civil war, by hand.
Water was also pumped into the pit to loosen the sludge and allow the huge animals to climb out safely.
Losing 11 elephants, including three calves, would have been a devastating blow to Cambodia's wildlife.
There are only thought to be a few hundred endangered Asian elephants left inside the country as populations fall due to habitat loss. (Daily Mail)

Will renegotiate China funded projects like SL did: Nasheed
	
Maldivian opposition leader Mohamed Nasheed has said, when they come to power, they will renegotiate the terms of Chinese-funded projects following the example set by Sri Lanka to see if they were fair and in the interest of the country, Indian Express reported on Wednesday.
?We will learn from the experience of the Sri Lankan Ports Minister Arjuna Ranatunga in re-negotiating the deal over Chinese built Hambantota port,? Nasheed has told select Colombo-based foreign correspondents on Wednesday.
Nasheed, who is leader of the Maldivian Democratic Party (MDP), said that when he or any opposition leader becomes President in the 2018 election, the Chinese projects will be re-examined.
But this is not going to be easy thing to do because 70 to 80 per cent of the Maldives? external debt is to China, he noted.
He is hoping to follow Sri Lankan Minister Ranatunga?s ?strategy? in renegotiating with the Chinese.
The Maldivian leader said that China is not transparent in its dealings and it prefers to work with authoritarian regimes being itself authoritarian. He also said that he will not say that China has no territorial interests in the Maldives.
Meanwhile, he said he hoped that President Abdulla Yameen would come for talks with him and the opposition.
?I want him to change. I am not for denying him his full term. In the Maldives nobody has been able to complete his term. We want to change the leader but in a constitutional and parliamentary way,? Nasheed said.
?We are also keen on democratizing the structure first, before we change the head. We will use Parliament to set up an independent judiciary, an independent human rights commission,? he added.
Asked if he would be the joint opposition candidate in the 2018 parliamentary election, Nasheed said that his expectation is that there may not be any need for it at that time. The political field will democratized so that every party can hope to win.
Nasheed said the international community is backing the opposition, some openly like the US, EU and Canada, but some support quietly, like India and Sri Lanka.?
