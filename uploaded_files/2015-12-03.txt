Probe says SLRC sexual harassment charges false: India
	
An investigation into allegations of demand for sexual favours by officials of Sri Lanka Red Cross (SLRC) from the beneficiaries of India-funded houses in the Tamil-dominated Northern Province found that the charges were false and baseless, Indian Minister of State for External Affairs V. K. Singh has said.
Rajya Sabha was informed about findings of the joint probe by Indian Consulate General in Jaffna, SLRC and International Federation of Red Cross (IFRC), Zee news said.
"The report concluded that the allegation of sexual harassment made by the complainant was false and baseless. The report concluded that a few disgruntled employees of SLRC had fabricated the allegations to malign the reputation of SLRC," said Minister Singh while replying to a question.
The probe panel had concluded its investigation in October.
Singh said the report was handed over to Sri Lanka's Ministry of Law and Order and Prison Reforms by IFRC and SLRC.
India had offered to build 50,000 houses in the war- ravaged northern province of Sri Lanka and construction of more than 39,500 of them have been completed.

Asian Alliance Insurance PLC clinched two prestigious awards ? a Gold in the Insurance category and a Silver in the Overall Large Companies category ? at the 2015 National Business Excellence Awards (NBEA), thereby increasing the tally of prestigious international and national awards bagged by the company.?
The two latest awards from the National Chamber of Commerce of Sri Lanka, which recognized Asian Alliance Insurance?s excellence in business and contribution to the economic progress of the country, conclude a remarkable month for the insurer. In early November 2015, the company overcame competition from giants in the insurance sector in Asia to receive the highly prestigious award for ?Innovation of the Year? at the Asia Insurance Awards and thereafter also won a Bronze Award in the Life Insurance category at the Sri Lanka Institute of Marketing (SLIM) Brand Excellence Awards 2015.
?Asian Alliance Insurance takes great pride in these prestigious accolades based on diverse criteria, which recognize our excellence in an array of key areas of operations,? Managing Director Iftikar Ahamed said.
?More important than the awards themselves, the entire Asian Alliance Insurance team takes pride in the vast progress that we have achieved in many fronts, which has culminated in recognition at international and national level. These awards also serve as a motivator for us to keep raising the bar further, especially with regard to enhancing customer convenience.?
The National Business Excellence Awards, this year?s edition of which was held recently at Hilton Colombo and followed by a gala dinner, annually recognize and reward Sri Lankan organizations that have excelled in all-round performance.

Colombo District Court vacates enjoining order issued against HNB
	
		 		 
		 
			
Colombo District Judge T.D. Gunasekera vacated the enjoining order issued previously against Hatton National Bank PLC (HNB) implementing its Social Media Policy, considering the strong objections raised by the counsel appearing for HNB when the case was taken up for inquiry on November 12, 2015. ?
This case had been filed by the Ceylon Bank Employees Union (CBEU) challenging the Social Media Policy that had been introduced by HNB last year stipulating procedure and conduct when employees of the bank engage in social media. The CBEU has specifically requested court to annul the decision taken by HNB recently, to take disciplinary action against three of its employees who are members of the CBEU for acting in violation of the said Social Media Policy.
Romesh De Silva, PC who appeared for the defendant HNB made submissions in court stating that the subject Social Media Policy had been introduced by HNB in February 2014 and was in operation without any objection from the plaintiff union until disciplinary action was initiated against three of their employees recently for violation of the said Social Media Policy. ?
The subject policy is a proper and justifiable document which is intended to safeguard the interest and the image of the bank and applied in situations where employees of the defendant bank engage in social media in their official capacity only and not in their private capacity. He further stated that the Social ?Media Policy of the bank requires approval from the bank?s management in cases where employees act on behalf of the bank, mentioning the name of the bank and also specifically when providing details of products and services of the bank in social media. He stated that many organisations both local and abroad including Bank of England have similar Social Media Policies applicable to their employees to safeguard the interests of such organisations.
Quoting two separate Supreme court judgments of Chief Justice Sharwananda and Justice Soza, De Silva PC stated that although the constitution of the country guarantees freedom of expression and publication as fundamental rights, such rights are not absolute and hence should be used without infringing the rights and freedom of others.?
The subject employees of the defendant bank have posted certain comments detrimental to the interest and the image of the HNB in an open domain website operated by the CBEU. Such adverse comments posted in a website open to the public can have a negative impact on the business of the defendant bank which is a leading financial institution in the country.
He further submitted that the plaintiff CBEU had suppressed from court the provisions available in the letters of appointment of the relevant employees which enables the bank to take disciplinary action against them in case of breach of discipline, quite apart from the provisions of the Social Media Policy.
De Silva PC also stated that the plaintiff has produced their own translation of the Social Media Policy of HNB stating that it is a document issued by the defendant bank misleading the court at the time of obtaining the enjoining order and strongly objected for any extension of the said enjoining order.
Harsha Soza PC who appeared for the plaintiff union stated that the subject Social Media Policy that has been introduced by HNB is an illegal document which violates the fundamental freedoms of employees who are members of the CBEU. He specifically stated that a summary dismissal procedure has been introduced by the bank against the employees who violate the Social Media Policy, implementation of which would bring about irreparable loss to his client.
After considering the submissions made by both the counsels the District Judge vacated the previous enjoining order issued against HNB restricting any disciplinary action being taken on the subject three employees.
In his order the District Judge stated that the defendant bank has issued show cause letters on the relevant staff members who are purported to have violated the Social Media Policy which indicates that the bank has no intention in going for any summary dismissal.
Furthermore, notwithstanding the provisions of the subject Social Media Policy in question, the defendant bank has a legal right to take disciplinary action against the relevant employees under the provisions of the individual letters of appointment which have not been disclosed to the court by the plaintiff union at the time of requesting for the enjoining order.
Also the District Judge has stated that the enjoining order requested covers a wide area of activity which may restrict even the lawful actions of the defendant bank and the plaintiff union has erred in not being specific in its request regarding the exact reason for requesting the enjoining order. The plaintiff cannot request for an enjoining order exceeding the exact requirement and covering a wide scope of activity without being specific in their requirement.
Accordingly, the enjoining order was vacated and the case was postponed for 25th January 2016 for filing of objections.

'Date of death sentence on SL maid unknown'
	
	No Sri Lankan is among the fifty people convicted over various offences in Saudi Arabia and whose punishments have been scheduled to be carried out tomorrow, Foreign Employment Minister Thalatha Athukorala said.
	A Sri Lankan maid was sentenced to be stoned to death after being found guilty of having a clandestine affair with an unmarried Sri Lankan in Saudi Arabia. The man was ordered 100 lashes.
	Meanwhile, speculation is rife that the death sentence meted out to the Sri Lankan woman would be carried out tomorrow.
	The minister said according to Sri Lankan Embassy sources in Saudi, the sentences on a group of 50 convicted people from various foreign countries had been scheduled for tomorrow, but that no Sri Lankans were among them.
	?We have informed the Sri Lankan Embassy in Saudi Arabia to inform us the date fixed for the carrying out of the sentence on the Sri Lankan. Media reports said the punishment will take place tomorrow. When I asked the officials, they said they were not aware of a Sri Lankan scheduled for punishment,? she said.
	Speaking about the appeal made by the Sri Lankan government to the Riyad Court requesting to reconsider the sentence given to the woman, the minister said the Riyad Court had not responded to our request yet.
	However, she said they could only make a request to be more lenient on the Sri Lankan housemaid.
	Meanwhile, Foreign Minister Mangala Samaraweera had an urgent meeting yesterday with the Charg? d? Affaires of the Embassy of Saudi Arabia in Colombo at the Parliament complex to express the government's concern on the reported judgment of the Riyad Court that a Sri Lankan woman was sentenced to be stoned to death on the charge of adultery.
	While seeking the indulgence of the Saudi Government, the Minister requested for sympathetic consideration in respect of the accused.
	According to Foreign Employment Bureau records, 10 Sri Lankans (8 males and 2 females) had been sentenced to death in several countries including Dubai, Abu Dhabi, Lebanon and Saudi Arabia. (Piyumi Fonseka) ?

Fitch Assign Mercantile Investments and Finance ?BBB-(lka)? rating
	
		 		 
		 
			
Fitch Ratings Lanka has assigned Mercantile Investments and Finance PLC (MIF) a national long-term rating of ?BBB-(lka)?. The outlook is stable. The agency has also assigned the company?s outstanding senior unsecured debentures a national long-term rating of ?BBB-(lka)?.
MIF?s rating reflects its modest franchise stemming from its long operating history, satisfactory capitalisation and loan-book exposure to less risky customer segments relative to peers. However, its ratings also capture its high risk appetite, which is evident in its substantial exposure to equity investments, low profitability metrics relative to peers and greater reliance on concentrated and short-term funding.
Equity investments accounted for 16.8 percent of total assets at the end of the financial year to March 2015 (FYE15), much higher than the level at similarly rated peers, leaving the company vulnerable to market risk. In addition, MIF is in breach of the regulator?s rule that limits equity investments to 25 percent of capital funds for non-bank financial institutions, with equity investments at 52.2 percent of capital funds at FYE15.
MIF?s ROA has declined to 1.9 percent at end-1HFY16 from 3.2 percent at FYE13 largely due to weak net interest margin (NIM) and high impairment charges relative to peers. Fitch believes that a potential increase in operating costs due to branch expansion and an increase in credit costs could hamper operating profitability and internal capital generation.
Fitch views MIF?s concentrated deposit base and high negative maturity mismatches as risks to its funding profile. Deposits are the main source of funding for MIF, but its deposit base is highly concentrated compared with similarly rated peers.
MIF?s negative mismatches of assets and liabilities of less than one year are higher than that for similarly rated peers. It amounted to 47 percent of equity at end-October 2015, 50 percent at FYE15 and 65 percent at FYE14. Unutilised credit lines covered 52 percent of the negative mismatches at end-October 2015. Funding lines sourced by MIF by pledging its assets could help to reduce such mismatches.
MIFs regulatory Tier 1 capital adequacy ratio decreased to 19.6 percent at end-1HFY16 from 21.7 percent at FYE15 (FYE14: 22.5 percent). The loan book increased by 21 percent in FYE15 (FYE14: 17 percent), in line with the industry. Fitch expects a further dilution in capitalisation due to MIF?s expanding operations, but believes that capitalisation should remain satisfactory for its current rating.
Fitch believes that MIF?s higher exposure to less risky assets, such as motor cars (40 percent of total advances at FYE15) has supported its asset quality. MIF?s gross regulatory NPL ratio (FYE15: 4.2 percent) has historically remained below that of the industry.
MIF?s outstanding senior debentures are rated at the same level as MIF?s National Long-Term Rating, as the issue ranks equally with the obligations to the company?s other senior unsecured creditors.
The company was established in 1964, and is majority owned by the Ondaatjie family, who directly hold 57 percent of MIF?s equity. At end-June 2015, MIF accounted for 3.3 percent of non-bank financial institution sector assets in Sri Lanka. MIF mainly provides vehicle financing through lease and hire purchase.

Fitch assigns LB Finance ?A-(lka)?; outlook stable
	
		 		 
		 
			
Fitch Ratings has assigned LB Finance PLC (LB) a national long-term rating at ?A-(lka)? with a stable outlook.
LB?s national long-term rating reflects its established franchise among licensed finance companies (LFC), whose higher yielding exposures have supported sound profitability. The rating also captures its relatively higher risk appetite as indicated by its exposure to gold-backed loans. Fitch views LB?s capital as satisfactory taking into account the entity?s good revenue generation.
LB?s leading 11 percent deposit market share among LFCs, as well as its extensive branch network has supported the company?s funding position. At the same time, it also exposes LB to higher liquidity risk compared with peers in particular as gross loans reached 90 percent of assets at end 1HFY16 which is higher than the industry. Meanwhile, its share of liquid assets (as a percent of total assets) declined to 9 percent. Mitigating factors include its moderately concentrated deposit base and un-utilised backup facilities.
Fitch sees LB?s product exposure to gold-backed loans (17 percent of gross loans at end 1HFY16) as being a potential risk to its asset quality due to the volatility of gold prices even though the focus is on short tenure facilities (almost all under six months). This concentration is unique in the LFC peer group. LB?s business focus remains on vehicle financing (75 percent of the loan book at end 1HFY16) with motor cars and three-wheelers accounting for 26 percent and 24 percent of the total at end-1HFY16. About 60 percent of its motor car and three-wheeler loans comprise unregistered vehicles, which is a positive as they are newly imported and are of a better credit quality.
Fitch expects LB?s net incremental non-performing loans (NPLs) to increase in the medium term in line with the entity?s projected loan growth. Its 90 days overdue loans are higher than peers?. Reported NPLs at a five-month level improved to 4.6 percent at 1HFY16 from 5.2 percent in FY15, the latter being, however, mostly a function of solid loan growth (1HFY16: 12.6 percent, FY15: 15.1 percent). Revision of its impairment policy in FY15 resulted in a significant improvement in its provision coverage.
LB?s pre-impairment profit to average total assets stood at 8.5 percent at end-1HFY16 (FY15: 8.8 percent, FY14: 6.8 percent), similar to higher rated peers. Its cost to income ratio remained the lowest among peers at 36 percent at end 1HFY16 on the back of greater scale. Higher net interest margins (NIMs) reflect relatively higher risk products such as gold-backed lending and three-wheeler leasing, along with an increase in lower cost wholesale borrowings. However, Fitch believes that a potential increase in operating costs due to branch expansion and an increase in credit costs could hamper operating profitability and internal capital generation, in the medium term.
The rating reflects Fitch?s expectation that LB?s profitability remains sufficient to allow for growth, while maintaining capital ratios at the current level. The regulatory Tier-1 ratio stood at 16.0 percent at end-FY15.
An upgrade of LB?s rating is contingent upon the company achieving stronger capitalisation levels along with a moderation of its risk appetite demonstrated through lower exposure to risky assets. A more comfortable liquidity position would also support the rating.
Fitch would downgrade LB?s rating if the company fails to maintain its capital levels, weaker profitability or if there is a sustained deterioration of in asset quality. An increase in liquidity risk could also lead to a downgrade.

Indian labourer forced to sell kidney in SL
	
Police in Akola in Maharashtra, India have busted an international kidney racket by arresting a moneylender who had forced a daily wage labourer to travel to Sri Lanka to sell off a kidney in order to repay a loan of Indian Rs.20,000, Daily News and Analysis (DNA) reported today.
According to a report, the kidney racket may be linked to farmer suicides in Vidarbha. A spate of farmer suicides in the region has alarmed India, but part of the reason is the moneylenders' exploitation poor farmers and labourers.
The Akola police had discovered the kidney racket when they found the daily wage labourer Santosh Gawli's travel to Sri Lanka on a tourist visa was suspicious. The police picked the labourer up on Monday and found out the truth.
The police have also arrested an agent, Devendra Shirsat, who struck the deal for the moneylender, Anand Jadhav in Colombo. The role of a Nagpur hospital, where the preliminary tests were conducted on the daily wage worker before he flew to Colombo, is also being probed, says the report. The case shows all signs of being an international racket, say police.
Two more victims of the moneylender have been tracked down as well.
A team of Akola police arrived in Mumbai on Wednesday to gather details from a hotel in Mumbai, where Gawli was staying before being flown by Jadhav and Shirshat to Colombo, says the report . Gawli alleged that Jadhav had threatened to kill him after he failed to pay the third installment of Rs 20,000, and hence he had no choice but to travel to Lanka.
The moneylender eventually made an offer - sell your kidney, get a waiver on your loan, and earn Rs 4 lakh extra.
Shirshat then arranged for Gawli's passport and visa. The Akola police also suspect that he served as a conduit between Jadhav and a Colombo Hospital where Gawli was forced to sell his kidney.
Gawli was then paid half of the Rs. 4 lakh he was promised. He has no idea about post-operative care and has received none in Akola so far, says the report.
Superintendent of Akola Police, CK Meena, said to the daily, "So far we have just registered a case of cheating against two as per the complaint lodged with us. Prima facie it appears to be the work of an organised syndicate, but we can't reveal anything since investigations are still in the premature stage," Meena said.

	President Maithripala Sirisena today urged the Opposition to support the government to formulate and enact a new Constitution and to put the nation on the right track.
	"We need the blessings and support of Opposition Members of Parliament to enact a new Constitution," the President said during the committee stage debate on the budget in Parliament last morning.
	"I personally feel all powers of the Executive President should be handed over to Parliament" he said indicating that time is right for reforms. He also reminded the House that it is almost one year since he assumed duties as President.
	The President recalled that the previous government could not bring about fruitful political reforms though it enjoyed a two-thirds majority in Parliament. He said the previous regime only used the two-thirds majority to introduce the 18th Amendment to the Constitution and further strengthen the powers of the executive.
	The President said he had been able to bring about discipline in his spending. "I don't take delegations of more than 200 people in chartered aircraft," he said and added that he was able to end an era where monies were pocketed even from the purchase of wreaths that were sent to funeral houses.

Russian tourists may swap Turkey for SL
	
Turkey and Egypt, the most popular destinations for Russians, could be replaced with Asian countries like Sri Lanka, Vietnam, Thailand and China since these countries have the necessary tourist infrastructure in place, Russia Beyond the Headlines (RBTH) reported on Wednesday.
The two of the most popular destinations for Russians last year were Turkey and Egypt.
However, after the October 31 bombing of a plane with Russian tourists over the Sinai Peninsula, Russia stopped air traffic with Egypt and evacuated all its tourists from the country.? And then, when, Turkey downed the Russian Su-24 bomber carrying out a combat mission in Syria, Moscow imposed a ban on charter flights to Turkey, abolished the visa-free regime and recommended that tourists not to travel to that country.
The closing of two highly popular destinations has forced travel companies to urgently look for a replacement, and some of the main candidates are in Southeast Asia.
According to industry specialists surveyed by RBTH, Asian beaches are competitive when it comes to price and service, but it takes longer to fly to them from the European part of Russia, and they are not very well known to Russian tourists.
An air ticket from Moscow to Vietnam or southern China costs almost thrice as much as a ticket from the Russian capital to Turkey or Egypt. ?The main expense for travel to Asia is airplane tickets,? Vladimir Kaganer, Chief Executive of Tez Tour, one of the largest Russian tour operators, told RBTH. ?Air transportation from Moscow to Southeast Asian countries is expensive and takes a long time, not less than 8 hours.?
?Turkey and Egypt could be replaced by Vietnam, Thailand, China and Sri Lanka since these countries have the necessary tourist infrastructure in place,?Kaganer said.
?Hainan (a resort island in southern China) may be a quality alternative to Egypt, because it also provides beach recreation in the winter season,? says Svetlana Pyatikhatka, Executive Director of the World without Borders Tourist Association. ?Moreover, in contrast to Egypt and Turkey, Hainan has no common borders with the regions that pose a terrorist threat.

Vehicle permits restored for exec. grade state employees
	
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe told Parliament today that public servants would be given a permit to import a vehicle once in ten years.
Speaking during the committee stage debate on the budget, he said the permits would be issued only twice during their career.
The Prime Minister said it was impossible to give a vehicle permit once in five years considering the traffic congestion on the roads.
He said the government had no option but to introduce a contributory pension scheme for the public sector because the government could no longer afford a handout.
As for MPs the Prime Minister said offices would be provided to all of them at a location close to the parliamentary complex.
He said a budget office would be set up soon by allowing Parliament to acquire the Agriculture Ministry office.
The Prime Minister said the stage was set to introduce the Right to Information Act and several other legislations soon. (Yohan Perera)

The Voice against Corruption Organisation today lodged a complaint with the Anti Corruption Committee Secretariat alleging that a former Cabinet Minister had forcibly taken over a Rs. 100 million worth block of land belonging to the Colombo Municipal Council (CMC) at Barnes Place, Colombo 07.
VAC member and JVP Western Provincial Councillor Sunil Watagala said the 154 perch-block had been taken over by the CMC in 1980 but had not been put to use so far.
Watagala said the said the former Minister had taken over the land through his gangsters with the knowledge of the Mayor and OIC of the Cinnamon Garden Police station.
?Former Commissioner of the Colombo Municipal Council Badrani Jayawardena had one time complained to the Cinnamon Garden Police that a group of men had been squatting on the land.? But the Police did not take any action. They continue to stay on the land,? Mr. Watagala said.
He asked the government to gain possession of the land if good governance and rule of law prevailed in the country Mr. Watagala said he expected Anti Corruption Committee Secretariat would take action against this incident as there was a lawsuit of illegal use of land and illegal intrusion into a government land.
